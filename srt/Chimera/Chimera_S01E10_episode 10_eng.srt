00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:07,030

2
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,180
 Chimera

3
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:28,010
  The characters, locations, incidents, religious sects, etc. in this drama are fiction and have no relation to reality.

4
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,500
 Episode 10

5
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,200
Bastard!

6
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,070
Don't move!

7
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:13,650
If you do anything foolish, we'll all die together.

8
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,190
You did this to yourself.

9
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,940
Do you understand?

10
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,250
Stay still, bastard!

11
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,540
- Let go. 
 - Stay still.

12
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,980
Where is the bomb?

13
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,590
I'll kill you all.

14
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,010
-Stay still. 
 -Let go!

15
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,900
Let go! You're not letting go?

16
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,660
I'm injured. Take me to the hospital.

17
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,310
Stay still!

18
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,710
Call the reporters!

19
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:28,050
Kang Sang Gu took the firefighter qualification test up until 2013, but he kept failing.

20
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,140
Since then, he's been ordering uniforms online and running a blog.

21
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,440
I think there was some sort of event for firefighters online.

22
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,900
Mr. Kang Sang Gu.

23
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:50,390
You're the one who brought bombs disguised as bottled water to the construction site of the new Seoryeon office building right?

24
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:57,130
Did you go to and from the crime scene using a truck registered Pyo Ji Seong?

25
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,220
I don't know.

26
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,100
Your DNA was found inside the truck.

27
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,190
What a liar.

28
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:11,190
Lie? Watch how you speak to me, asshole.

29
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:17,310
Just because you didn't see anything doesn't mean you didn't leave any traces behind.

30
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,510
Hey! It wasn't even hot out that day. Why were you sweating that much?

31
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:25,400
On the driver's seat, steering wheel and foot mat.

32
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,590
Your sweat was all over all of them.

33
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,220
Aren't you nervous about running around with bombs?

34
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:37,460
The results will come out soon, so we'll have to wait and see.

35
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:47,600
This is the CCTV footage from the site of the explosion. This is you isn't it?

36
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,460
I don't think so.

37
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:56,190
You thought you couldn't be caught if you didn't show your face right, asshole?

38
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:00,960
There is a thing called gait analysis. Each person walks differently.

39
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,340
Look at this. Are you worried now?

40
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,270
That's not all. Have you heard of glottal analysis?

41
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:12,400
It was confirmed that your voice matches the one that called the broadcasting station.

42
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,490
Lawyer.

43
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:20,230
I've been telling you to call a lawyer for me since the beginning.

44
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,160
I called one. They'll be here soon.

45
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,930
But this neighborhood has terrible traffic right now.

46
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,980
In the meantime, let's talk a little bit more.

47
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,360
Then I'll use my right to remain silent.

48
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,630
I have the right the remain silent.

49
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,370
Is there a bomb installed inside Chairman Seo Hyeon Tae's house?

50
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,460
Do you really believe what that jerk says?

51
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,340
It doesn't sound like he's bluffing.

52
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,660
Should we believe someone whose had such a traumatic life?

53
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,440
He even went so far as to pretend to be a firefighter.

54
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,790
What was the FBI doing to be deceived by someone like that?

55
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,530
Why?

56
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,200
Are FBI members shamans? Should they know something as soon as they look at someone?

57
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,900
Do you know everything?

58
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,030
Why are you going overboard?

59
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,120
The EOD team are also experts.

60
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,270
If there were explosive materials at Chairman Seo's house, they wouldn't have missed them.

61
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,460
What if there is something that they missed?

62
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,410
We don't have time for this.

63
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,760
Kang Sang Gu might have installed a time-activated bomb.

64
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:40,910
I requested the urgent cooperation of the EOD team from the University.

65
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:44,930
We'll search Kang Sang Gu and Seo Hyeon Tae's houses together.

66
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,640
Understood.

67
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,200
Excuse me.

68
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,550
What should we do with Kang Sang Gu?

69
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,460
Investigator!

70
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,310
Are you okay?

71
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,420
I asked if you were okay.

72
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,960
Of course.

73
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,810
Count backwards from 981

74
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,100
Try it.

75
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,690
981 980 987 989 9...

76
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:35,390
97 979 979

77
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,370
Investigator Hathaway, please go rest.

78
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,200
When you were held hostage until now, it's too much for you to interrogate the culprit.

79
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,390
Kang Sang Gu said something about a bomb to me.

80
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,830
I have to finish that conversation.

81
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:57,120
I'm going to the Chairman Seo's house now.

82
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,460
Are you going yourself?

83
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,050
Kang Sang Gu is the self-proclaimed Chimera and an IED expert.

84
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:08,000
No one else will be able to find the bombs he planted.

85
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,260
The only people who can find them are you and I.

86
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:25,020
You said you planted a bomb at Seo Hyeon Tae's house.

87
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,470
Is that true?

88
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,500
I can't say.

89
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,120
You've never been to his house.

90
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,150
How did you plant a bomb there?

91
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,520
I'm Chimera.

92
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,900
 KCBI Police

93
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,020
Isn't this a firecracker?

94
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,710
There is gunpowder inside this.

95
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:24,260
He's been going around collecting all of these.

96
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,890
Did you just admit to being Chimera?

97
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:35,950
The person responsible for three bombing murders including police officers.

98
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,360
You mean that Chimera right?

99
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,650
Yes. That's right.

100
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:46,530
The homemade explosives that killed Son Wan Gi, Han Ju Seok and Ham Yong Bok.

101
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:49,140
Did you build and plant them yourself?

102
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,120
Of course.

103
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,270
For Son Wan Gi it was oxygen.

104
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:57,150
For Han Ju Seok, it was a mixture of nitrate and aluminum.

105
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:00,820
For Ham Yong Bok it was white phosphorus. Right?

106
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,030
You know it well.

107
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,720
You're lying again.

108
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:11,490
Han Ju Seok's case involved magnesium.

109
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,730
Not aluminum.

110
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:21,520
You don't know anything about Chimera other than what has been released to the press.

111
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,160
Why are you lying?

112
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,910
What are you taking the fall for someone else's crime.

113
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,680
I don't know.

114
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,730
Why would I be Chimera?

115
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,330
Miss.

116
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,880
Explosives?

117
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,410
The search ended earlier.

118
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:55,380
There has been a new report indicating that there might be explosives here.

119
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,130
Please cooperate.

120
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,210
Let's go. 
  SWAT Team

121
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:00,850
You can't come in.

122
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,100
We don't have time.

123
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,880
You'll force my hand if you keep this up.

124
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,820
What are you doing in my house?

125
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,730
Go ahead.

126
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:22,820
Why did you confess to being Chimera.

127
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:27,980
The richest person in South Korea.

128
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,800
Seo Hyeon Tae.

129
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,230
What is that person afraid of?

130
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:41,120
TH-5 made the man who once ran a countryside factory into a chaebol.

131
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,210
But everyone on the research development team for that compound is dead?

132
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,220
At the hands of Chimera 35 years ago.

133
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,760
Someone who should have died back then.

134
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,550
Who is the one left alive?

135
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,190
Do you know what time it is right now?

136
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:08,770
What is the meaning of this?

137
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:11,100
I'm sorry for interrupting at this hour.

138
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,570
We've met before.  What's going on?

139
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:19,890
We received information that there were explosives placed in your home.

140
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:24,050
It's only yesterday that you turned the house inside out. This again!

141
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,030
Although I'm sure it's uncomfortable for you, we are going to take a look.

142
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,680
Hey, Detective.

143
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,440
Inside and outside of this house, there are more than 30 CCTV cameras.

144
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,650
The security team  monitors them 24 hour per day. The system is upgraded every six months.

145
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:43,660
Even the housekeeping staff here are trained as security guards.

146
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,910
It means even Korea's President can't enter as he pleases.

147
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,470
Do you understand what I'm saying?

148
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:55,250
Dozens of bombs can be seen in this house.

149
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,160
In my eyes—

150
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,060
What?

151
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,760
Chloride based cleaning supplies,

152
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,260
aluminium, lithium batteries,

153
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:09,810
celluloid plastics, sprays with LPG (liquified petroleum gas), portable butane gas.

154
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:13,090
There are dozens of explosives here.

155
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,400
What's the point of having so many CCTVs?

156
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,300
Please don't look down on the chimera, Chairman.

157
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:25,110
What did you say your name was?

158
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,150
It's Cha Jae Hwan.

159
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,440
Yes, Detective Cha Jae Hwan.

160
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:34,090
Then, look anywhere.

161
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:40,090
In exchange, if you can't find any, you will accept responsibility.

162
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,700
You're not the chimera.

163
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,110
You're a phony pretending to be someone else.

164
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,630
I said go rescue Seo Hyeon Tae who is acting so arrogant.

165
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,090
Even if you beat me to death, you can't find it.

166
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:02,120
What did I install in that house?

167
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,710
It's not a fire?

168
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:14,480
If you claim to be the Chimera, others will think of bombs and fires, right?

169
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:22,320
But when I think about it, you never told me it was a bomb.

170
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:28,480
 Was Chimera ever on the scene?

171
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,000
 What is the advantage of a chemical crime?

172
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:37,140
 The advantage of chemical crimes is...the culprit doesn't have to be there.

173
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,150
 That's what I say.

174
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,740
 Does that mean a bomb had already been installed?

175
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,830
 In Seo Hyeon Tae's house?

176
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,590
 I can't say.

177
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:57,890
What you installed in Seo Hyeon Tae's house

178
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:00,300
is not a bomb, is it?

179
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,530
What I'm saying is right, isn't it?

180
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,640
Yes, Investigator.

181
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,100
Detective Cha.  It's not fire.

182
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,420
What?

183
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:28,440
Kang Sang Gu impersonated  the chimera because of the chimera's image.

184
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,270
Up to now, Chimera has killed five people with fire.

185
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:35,140
So you would think the MO of the next crime will be fire.

186
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,450
Up to now, the EOD (Explosive Ordinance Destruction) team has found something weird.

187
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:42,670
It isn't a fire? If so, then ...?

188
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:46,900
At the time Kang Sang Gu didn't tell me it was a bomb.

189
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,750
He said it was chemical crime.

190
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:56,500
If it is a chemical crime, is he talking about noxious chemicals?

191
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,010
What is this?

192
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,680
 Box 1

193
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,000
Box 1

194
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,720
  Box 3

195
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,100
 Chemical protective clothing (microporous film, gas and dust protection, radiation protection, antiviral)…

196
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,560
Chemicals.

197
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,490
What would I think about?

198
00:15:55,490 --> 00:16:00,620
If I were Kang Sang Gu, what would I bring in here?

199
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,730
 Certificate of Appreciation 
 To Chairman Lee Hwa-jung for model cooperation between industry and university.

200
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,620
 Kim Hong Joong, President of Hanmyeong University

201
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,970
What's your connection to Hanmyeong University?

202
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,840
Hanmyeong University?

203
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,770
It's been guite long  that we provided support at that level for academic-industry cooperation

204
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:26,350
to the research and development expenses for the graduate school and scholarships.

205
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:29,940
The chairman of their foundation is my friend.

206
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,780
Ah, I see.

207
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:40,610
Was there perhaps any item that the university's Material Department sent you?

208
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:49,670
Fertilizer, air purifier, filter, air freshener, whatever.

209
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,190
What is this?

210
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:02,340
This is from the university president's office.

211
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,860
To celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the school's founding.

212
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,180
When did you receive it?

213
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,700
About two weeks ago?

214
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,590
Yes, Geun Yeong. Have you found anything?

215
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:34,110
- Seonbae, get out of there! 
 - What?

216
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,890
 Please come out now. Bring everyone out.

217
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,690
Why? Kang Sang Gu brought protective clothing for radiation.

218
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:43,640
On his internet search record, subjects like  how to handle radioactive substances,

219
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,350
protective clothing and protective equipment pop up.

220
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:49,860
- What are you saying? 
 It's radiation. Radiation.

221
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,780
Is there a medical product?

222
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,260
It's called radioactive iodine solution.

223
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,280
It's usually used for cancer treatment.

224
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,170
Kang Sang Gu bought it under the name of the school corporation.

225
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:07,350
It's extremely dangerous,

226
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:13,050
so even patients who have prescriptions receive it under the control of the hospital in an isolation room

227
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:16,930
Isn't it dangerous for both the EOD and me?

228
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:21,170
You'll be safe after the half-life of the radioactive substance.

229
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:25,170
You talk so relaxed. Half-life?

230
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,950
It means the numbers of atoms is declining.

231
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:32,810
For radioactive iodine, the radioactivity lasts for about eight days

232
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:36,110
I'm saying you're all right.

233
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,810
Is iodine radioactive?

234
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:42,020
It's good for my health, isn't it?  They recommend eating a lot?

235
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:47,370
Dried seaweed has a necessary nutrient for the human body.  It is stable iodine.

236
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:53,190
Radioactive iodine is an isotope of iodine with a different number of neutrons from stable iodine.

237
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:56,350
Radioactive substances have unstable nuclei.

238
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:59,740
As the radioactive iodine decays,

239
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:03,520
it emits high-energy particles or electromagnetic waves.

240
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,860
When the beta rays penetrate human cells,

241
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,750
it causes deformation and cancer.

242
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,500
So, if radioactive iodine is exposed to the air, ...

243
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,620
You could immediately inhale it.

244
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,650
Those who have been exposed for a long time?

245
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,950
For now, they have been quarantined.

246
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,860
You'll know when you get tested.

247
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:28,310
Oh, okay.

248
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,040
 Victim A's DNA was detected.

249
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:34,010
Yun Jin called after watching the news.

250
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,870
She should come home if she is worried. I'll call her.

251
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:43,730
That girl.  Is she American?

252
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:46,160
Are you ready to give up your position there?

253
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,770
At the global reception of the news, they said "Wall Street is very nervous."

254
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,960
What about headquarters?

255
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,910
When other family's kids get a doctor's degree, they come home  and obediently learn how to work.

256
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:01,850
She is smart but was raised wrong.

257
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:04,320
You only say that about Yun Jin.

258
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,780
That's why she doesn't want to return to Korea.

259
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:10,720
All right.

260
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,110
I'll call her.

261
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:17,660
What is this now, seriously. I'm even embarassed to see the doctors.

262
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:21,140
No wonder I suddenly lost five kilos.

263
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:24,760
They said you will gain it back as soon as your thyroid is treated.

264
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,090
The criminal was caught.

265
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:29,730
Relax.  It's all over.

266
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,930
Is it over?

267
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:36,980
Is this one really the Chimera?

268
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,340
What does that mean?

269
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,520
I met Lee Jung Yeop.

270
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,200
What about him?

271
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,440
There is someone who committed suicide 35 years ago.

272
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,160
He was the culprit of the Chimera Case whom my brother captured.

273
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:57,140
Lee Jung Yeop insisted that that person didn't commit suicide.

274
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:00,720
He wants to know the truth.

275
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:04,160
But, why ask us if he's dead?

276
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,160
I guess he believes that the culprit is among the people we know.

277
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,150
What kind of nonsense is he spouting?

278
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,220
For what purpose is he speaking nonsense? He's making it up.

279
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,460
What does he want?  Money?

280
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,720
I think ...

281
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,570
I think he is the son of the dead man.

282
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,760
I'm going to pick something he did wrong and whether it's through deportation

283
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:39,590
or something else, in any case, I'm thinking I must send him back quietly to the UK.

284
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:45,190
He said he'll make an issue of the TH-5 patent acquisition process.

285
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:48,400
What do you mean by an issue? What was wrong with the acquisition of the patent?

286
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,600
There have been hundreds of deaths related to TH-5.

287
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,300
Are people these days idiots?

288
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:59,760
In the Evergreen incident, some one burned himself to death and now a terrorist appeared.

289
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,790
I heard that the radiation terrorist is a TH-5 victim.

290
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,290
If this grows bigger, it won't end with just an affiliate company collapsing.

291
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:15,140
You could receive a life sentence.

292
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,120
Cha Jae Hwan

293
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,660
You did something huh? Congratulations.

294
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,450
Thank you, sir.

295
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:48,470
We have arrested the Chimera.

296
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,200
Applaud

297
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:58,330
During that time, I couldn't even go home because I had a hard time.

298
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:00,260
Congratulations.

299
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,960
Today,

300
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,690
there's no limit.

301
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:20,960
Let's drink. Good job!

302
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,380
Good job. Good job. Good job.

303
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,480
Now, pour a drink for the handsomest flower boy of Jungsan Station.

304
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,490
I'm tired of it.  I'm so tired of it.

305
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:44,740
I'm tired, man.  I'm tired, too.

306
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,240
Not you.

307
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,640
- I'll pour you a drink! 
 - All right!

308
00:23:55,610 --> 00:24:00,370
I'm not drinking.  I'm not drinking.  This is dirty and petty.

309
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,950
Okay, okay, here, drink it.

310
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:05,270
- It's your day too. 
 - You mean it?

311
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:10,420
Sure. I ate and got excited again.  I'm holding the steering wheel again.

312
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:13,230
Hey Hyungnim, I don't do that anymore.

313
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:16,670
And if you're pouring for me, pour a full one.

314
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:19,040
Eat a lot.  Here you go.

315
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,550
You worked hard all this time. Cheers!

316
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:25,240
Cheers!

317
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,110
- Good job! Good Job! 
 - Good job!

318
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,660
Umm...

319
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:41,020
You did a great job. Thanks to you, we were saved.

320
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:44,820
It was interesting for me too. It was worth it.

321
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:48,470
Investigator, you are almost our family.

322
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:52,120
Let's have a glass.

323
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,280
Drink it! Drink it!

324
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,860
Drink it! Drink it!

325
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:05,270
Let's drink and die!

326
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:11,300
Team Leader, the cola ... Drink beer.

327
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,990
Team Leader. I heard you were promoted to go to the main office.

328
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:19,860
- Congratulations. 
 - Congratulations.

329
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,950
It's not confirmed.

330
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:26,660
It seems the case, well, everything has been resolved.

331
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:30,190
Is it over?  Have we caught the chimera?

332
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:32,260
We haven't caught him yet.

333
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:36,630
Hey, what do you think you are? Don't meddle.

334
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:39,630
It's officially over.  It was announced as that.

335
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:42,190
You should realize that.

336
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:44,100
Well.

337
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,730
Kang Sang Gu is a copycat.

338
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:50,080
When all of you know that, why do you pretend you don't know?

339
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:57,030
I've been sitting for too long. I'll see you tomorrow.

340
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:59,020
Team Leader.

341
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,420
There is something I have to say.

342
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,690
Hey, you're drunk. Stop it.

343
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,140
Will it end like this?

344
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:16,870
Who will relieve the grudge of our dead boss, Han Ju Seok?

345
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,720
What resentment are you talking about?

346
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,440
What?

347
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,790
Hey, do you think that old man was clean?

348
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,990
Ah, that asshole.  He's drunk again. He has a bad drinking habit.

349
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:29,750
Stay still, asshole.

350
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:33,330
Hey, that guy had something to hide.  He was hiding evidence.

351
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:36,450
Didn't they say he was receiving threatening messages?  Isn't that right?

352
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:41,060
Sunbae, did Team Leader Han say something was going on?

353
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,360
Our team leader was not like that.

354
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,230
Damn. Then what?  I'll be honest.

355
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:50,570
Why would a detective  grovel in front of a criminal?

356
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:53,030
It's because he received something, that's why.

357
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:55,650
Damn, what the helll are you saying?

358
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:57,830
What's the matter with you when you drink?

359
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:03,640
Didn't you know every time you got drunk, Team Leader Han covered for you? Huh?

360
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,110
- Damn. 
- Lets get out.

361
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,150
- Seonbae. 
 - Seonbae? Seonbae.

362
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:10,960
If you want to be well treated by your seonbae,  behave properly. 
 - What, asshole?

363
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,360
- What did you say? 
 - Hey, Hey.Hey.

364
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,300
This asshole. Do you want to die?

365
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,090
- Hey, Cut it out. 
 - You f***.

366
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:22,230
Quit it. Damn.

367
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:28,830
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.I'm sorry.

368
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:32,690
There are things you can say about people and things you shouldn't say.

369
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:35,700
Are you saying those thing in front of a dead person? Huh?

370
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:40,620
Oh, is that how it is?  All right.  Detective Cha Jae Hwan. Yes.

371
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,510
You bastard.  Are you always covered in glory by yourself?

372
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,760
Why are you so clean?

373
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,030
If so, why do you keep seeing Lee Jeong Yeop recently?

374
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:53,030
When was it you were desperate to arrest him?

375
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:56,530
Now there's no one closer to you than him.

376
00:27:56,530 --> 00:28:00,060
Did you get something as a bribe  from Lee Jeong Yeop, that bastard?

377
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,860
Tell me.

378
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,470
- I said to tell me. 
 - Let's get out.

379
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:07,830
- What is it? Did I say something wrong? 
 Okay. Let's go. I said let's go.

380
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:10,570
That bastard has no manners.

381
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:13,530
Get out.

382
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:29,760
Who did you say?

383
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,630
He's the son of the dead Lee Sang Wu.

384
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,700
You say he's the son of Lee Sang Wu.

385
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,940
Are you just talking or do you know what that means now?

386
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:46,110
- Do you know that's a strong motive for murder? 
 - Yes, I know.

387
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,730
So then?

388
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:56,200
But, I keep thinking he's not the culprit.

389
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,400
Why do you think so?

390
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:02,150
That's just how I feel.

391
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:07,290
Hey, Cha Jae Hwan.  Are you really not going to wake up?

392
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:10,660
- Did Im Pil Seong, in fact, say anything before which was wrong?  
 - Team Leader.

393
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:14,840
Do you remember Dies Irae, Day of Wrath?

394
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,110
The phase at the scene of Team Leader Han's death?

395
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:23,300
Team Leader Han.  You are thinking that kind of ...

396
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,990
He might not have been a good person.

397
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:38,160
Please be objective, huh?

398
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,560
Don't be emotional.

399
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:18,460
The Han Ju Seok I knew was a just person.

400
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:25,120
I would be lying if I said that he never took a penny in bribes, but he never crossed the line.

401
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,380
There are so many temptations in this occupation.

402
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,900
It's not because I was close to him.

403
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:36,560
He was really someone I wanted to be like.

404
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,090
He wasn't the kind of person

405
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:47,280
who would look directly into your eyes, lie and steal evidence.

406
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:53,970
He didn't do anything wrong, so why did he keep so many secrets? Why?

407
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:03,280
That's why I keep thinking of Pil Seong's words and getting scared.

408
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:08,530
Am I too obsessed?

409
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:16,430
Even if others say that I am obsessive, if I have lingering doubts,

410
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:19,080
I have to follow my gut.

411
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:28,650
Two years ago, someone committed suicide right in front of me.

412
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:32,890
He shot himself in the head.

413
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,720
Tyler Riley

414
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,070
The elementary school gymnastics coach.

415
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,400
I still have those bullet marks on the walls of my room.

416
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:52,490
I pointed him out as the perpetrator.

417
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:58,660
I believed the statement of a 15-year old girl who claimed that he committed sexual assault.

418
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:04,160
He kept insisting on his innocence in court.

419
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:08,710
Crying, begging and praying.

420
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:13,480
I thought he was just putting on a show.

421
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:22,390
One day, I got home and he was there sitting on my couch.

422
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,260
Do you know what I said?

423
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:30,960
How did you make bail?

424
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,770
How did you know my home address?

425
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:36,890
I could only think things like that.

426
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,650
I didn't listen to a word he was saying.

427
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:45,080
Even after he pulled out the gun.

428
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,400
In those next three seconds.

429
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:56,110
What happened in those three seconds changed my life.

430
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:04,060
The courage to admit what you don't want to admit and accept truths that you don't want to accept.

431
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:09,250
I didn't have that.

432
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:43,620
I'm excited for the first time in a long time.

433
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:47,170
What's going on? Why did you call me out for a date?

434
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:50,170
Oh. Here.

435
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:54,460
Thank you for making time for me despite being busy.

436
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,050
Now that you are giving me things like this,

437
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:59,000
my condition must have gotten much worse right?

438
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,920
No, no. It's not that.

439
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,590
I'll be sad if you take it like that.

440
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,330
Sorry.

441
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:10,660
I should just see flowers as flower. But I keep seeing them as something else.

442
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:15,190
What is it that you want?

443
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,750
Can you find someone for me?

444
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:22,170
I'll give you enough cases.

445
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:25,860
Am I doing this because I don't have enough money?

446
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,870
Every time I find someone for you, someone dies.

447
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:31,310
It's not my business, but it doesn't sit well with me.

448
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:33,950
Do you think I killed them?

449
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:40,400
People who have killed others look different.

450
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:46,680
No matter how they smile, it creeps you out.

451
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:52,260
-What is the name of the person you're looking for? 
 - Her name is Ryu Seong Hui.

452
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:57,820
Thirty five years ago, she was a member of the Taesam chemical research team at Hanmyeong University.

453
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,610
It's a woman.

454
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:04,140
All of the other members of that research team died in a fire that happened around that time.

455
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,730
But she is the only one whose whereabouts are unknown.

456
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:10,450
Whereabouts are unknown?

457
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,100
Do I have to find her?

458
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,150
Why are you being like this?

459
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,850
Because it's ominous.

460
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:28,700
Anyway, this time my wife and I end up under this situation.

461
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,260
It's no problem. It's my job.

462
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,090
Let me know if you need anything.

463
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,130
There is nothing like that.

464
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:38,450
I don't understand people in our country.

465
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:42,170
Why are you so shy about saying what you want?

466
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:46,760
In that case, can I say one thing?

467
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,700
Sure?

468
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:52,760
I am going to ask you a question, so please answer honestly.

469
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,470
-Is this an interrogation? 
 -No, it is just a question.

470
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:02,740
If it is off the record.

471
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,490
Only I will know.

472
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:07,090
Good.

473
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:15,040
Chairman, I know you were in charge of the TH-5 chemical development team.

474
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:21,420
Did you know that nearly all of the people on that team were killed by Chimera?

475
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:25,320
I knew that. What about it?

476
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:30,700
Do you remember someone on the team named Ryu Seong Hui?

477
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:35,420
Ryu Seong Hui?

478
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:40,250
Yes. She was a key researcher in the development of TH-5.

479
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:44,160
Her whereabouts before and after the Chimera incident are unclear.

480
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:50,230
Oh. You mean that female researcher?

481
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:53,990
Do you know anything about her?

482
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:57,430
I'm not sure. I wouldn't know anything specific.

483
00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:00,960
I wasn't particularly close to her.

484
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:03,950
Oh really?

485
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:07,900
You seem to be very interested in that incident from 35 years ago.

486
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:12,780
It's a dark moment of the past. And they already caught the criminal anyway.

487
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:20,660
It's embarrassing to say, but Kang Sang Gu is not the real culprit.

488
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,960
He is a copycat.

489
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,920
We still haven't caught Chimera.

490
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,660
What did you just say?

491
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:34,870
We still haven't caught the real killer.

492
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:37,830
What about that terrorist you just caught?

493
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,850
He's a copycat.

494
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,630
We've already wrapped things up. Why are you saying something different now?

495
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:48,730
Hyungnim, just listen for now.

496
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,790
He is guilty of the explosion at the construction site and the attack at Chairman Seo's house.

497
00:37:55,790 --> 00:38:00,120
But, the previous cases regarding Son Wan Gi, Han Ju Seok and Ham Yong Bok

498
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,460
were all done by someone else.

499
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:08,130
Someone else? Who?

500
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:10,900
Aren't you thinking of that jerk?

501
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,060
It's Lee Jung Yeop isn't it?

502
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,890
Chief Bae!

503
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:19,390
Did you find any other information?

504
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:22,890
Speak!

505
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:27,250
Or do I have to go to the investigation headquarters myself? Make a decision.

506
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:34,690
The man who committed suicide 35 years ago.

507
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:37,900
The Chimera case suspect, Lee Sang Wu.

508
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,800
Do you remember him?

509
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:45,490
Lee Jung Yeop is his son.

510
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:07,430
I'm right.  The doctor, Sir.

511
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:10,110
Ah. Reporter Kim.

512
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,770
What brings you here?

513
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:15,640
I just have some things to take care of.

514
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,390
In this building?

515
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:22,590
Third Floor, a baduk club; Fourtth floor, a lawyer and  a dance school.

516
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,820
I played some Baduk.* ( Korean version of game of Go. )

517
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:29,140
I would have fallen for it if you said that you came for the dance academy.

518
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:32,740
1,2, cha, cha, cha, 3, 4, cha, cha, cha

519
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:36,530
-Well, then, I'll see you later. 
 -Wait!

520
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:40,340
I still don't know your name.

521
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:43,330
It's Lee Jung Yeop.

522
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:44,960
What?

523
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,440
Lee Jung Yeop.

524
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:52,870
Oh. Which hospital do you work at?

525
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:55,230
I work at Seoryun Hospital

526
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,500
You're here?

527
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,140
Did someone come by?

528
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,360
A guest.

529
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,170
What guest?

530
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:32,030
Just someone looking for some advice. Divorce counseling.

531
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:35,080
Why did you tell me to come here all of a sudden?

532
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,720
You're going today right? It's your maternal grandmother's death anniversary.

533
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:43,000
If you got divorced, you two are already strangers. Why are you taking care of your ex-mother-in-law's death anniversary?

534
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,760
Anyway, she was really selfish. When was it that she left because she hated being at home?

535
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,350
Watch how you talk about your mother.

536
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:53,260
She's the one who acted like I was just some stranger's kid she picked up off of the street.

537
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,500
What are you saying?

538
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:59,420
They're all kind and genteel. I'm the only one who is different.

539
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:01,010
Who said that?

540
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:03,390
My aunts.

541
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:06,110
Who do I resemble to be like this?

542
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:08,320
Like what?

543
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,100
You're mean.

544
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,140
This brat, really.

545
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:16,420
What's wrong with you?

546
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:21,880
Look, it's your mother calling again.

547
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,870
Hello?

548
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:26,180
I'm on my way now.

549
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:29,750
Why are you being like this again?

550
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:35,690
She said she doesn't want to come.

551
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:37,520
Yes. Yes.

552
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:07,020
Detective Cha!

553
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,970
What's going on at this hour?

554
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:11,070
Let's talk.

555
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,470
Sure, let's talk. What's up?

556
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:15,530
Lee Jeong Yeop. It's him isn't it?

557
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:17,860
The suspect who was arrested recently.

558
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,700
Does it look that way?

559
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,150
You said he was a foreigner.

560
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:25,070
He is a foreigner because he's British. He was adopted.

561
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,640
Adopted?

562
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,910
When?

563
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:31,380
It wouldn't be when he was big would it? It must have been when he was younger.

564
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:34,570
Why didn't you tell me that?

565
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:38,170
Why is that important? It's someone else's private life.

566
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:42,650
No.  Is it some kind of a hobby for you to be hanging out with someone who was once your prime suspect?

567
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:46,760
He was released because no charges were brought against him.

568
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,820
Of course. He did look pretty normal.

569
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:54,190
But what was he arrested for in the first place?

570
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:56,820
Originally, he must have had some kind of situation right?

571
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,250
Exactly. What kind of situation?

572
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:02,570
What about the Evergreen victims?

573
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:05,680
If you're so curious, can you stop holding me back?

574
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,310
I ought to. Are you really going to keep being so rude with your answers?

575
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:13,150
What kind of person are you? Are you really someone I can trust?

576
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:16,920
Then, can I trust you, Reporter Kim?

577
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,540
If you keep this up

578
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:22,720
I wont tell you even if I do find Ryu Seong Hui.

579
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:28,740
Ryu Seong Hui. Do you know anything about her?

580
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:32,150
I did find some things out.

581
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:34,630
But all of a sudden, I don't feel like talking anymore.

582
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:37,730
Why are you being like this?

583
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:42,130
Is that your girlfriend?

584
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:44,450
No. She's my high school classmate.

585
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:46,120
Let's go.

586
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:51,740
 UBB

587
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:54,630
Ryu Seong Hui was a whistleblower?

588
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:56,220
Yes.

589
00:43:56,220 --> 00:44:00,650
A problem was discovered with TH-5 during development.

590
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:03,010
The patent application was right around the corner.

591
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:08,930
But those issues were discovered and the research team's work was all in vain.

592
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:13,320
The deceased Im Sang Wuk and Oh Jong Geun were both Professor Park In Sang's henchmen.

593
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:18,670
Professor Park also received research funding from Seo Hyeon Tae.

594
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:23,110
Ryu Seong Hui must have been the only person to take issue with it.

595
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:28,560
If Ryu Seong Hui brought up a problem, I don't think that Seo Hyeon Tae or Professor Park would have just let it go.

596
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,600
Isn't that why she's in hiding?

597
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:36,200
Because she felt threatened?

598
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:40,040
After a short time, all of Professor Park's team was dead at the Chimera's hands.

599
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:43,170
At that point, what was the reason to stay hidden?

600
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:45,870
Because there was one threat left.

601
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:49,250
Seo Hyeon Tae.

602
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:56,670
But where did all of this information come from all of a sudden?

603
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:58,840
A report came in?

604
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:01,070
From whom?

605
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:03,800
I can't reveal my source.

606
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:10,320
Reporter Kim. Do you really think we can trust information that you bring to us like this?

607
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,020
If we want to build trust with one another, there should be nothing to hide.

608
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,840
Why?

609
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,530
Detective Cha also hid something about Lee Jeong Yeop from me.

610
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:24,620
If he was once a suspect, why are you going around together?

611
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:30,020
What is that person up to?

612
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:04,900
 Chimera from Greek mythology 
 Fire breathing monster!! 
 Chimera lighter symbol. What does it mean??

613
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:11,600

⇒ Industrial-educational collaboration research with Taesam Chemical 
 Researchers: Oh Jong Geun, Im Sang Wuk, Baek Eun Cheol (moved abroad) Rye Seong Hui

614
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:20,560
 Rye Seong Hui from Hanmyeong University. Whistleblower. Went missing in March.

615
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:25,340
 Mouth muffled or killed?

616
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,660
 Seoryeon Hospital

617
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:55,020
About that Ryu Seong Hui woman

618
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:57,680
Did you know that she was a widow with a daughter?

619
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,370
Yes. I did.

620
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:01,580
The fact that she died too?

621
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:03,480
She died?

622
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:06,990
There was a fire at her house.

623
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:11,080
She was in bed with the child. They couldn't get out in time.

624
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:14,770
The kid was so young. It's a shame.

625
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:20,430
But around that time, the neighbors saw something strange.

626
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:34,220
A sedan?

627
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:38,930
There was on reason for a luxury car like that to be in that town.

628
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:42,130
By any chance, the license plate...

629
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:44,300
Would anyone be able to remember that?

630
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:46,970
I guess it has been a long time since it happened.

631
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:49,470
But he must have come there often.

632
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:53,180
There were rumors that the driver was a young man.

633
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:55,060
A man?

634
00:49:56,010 --> 00:49:58,960
Why would a man come to a widow's house?

635
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,100
To date.

636
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:07,710
And the funny thing is...

637
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:10,900
About Ryu Seong Hui.

638
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:16,050
After a while, there were some people who saw her.

639
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:18,880
I thought you said that she died?

640
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:23,650
Her hair was loose and she carried a child on her back.

641
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:26,590
Isn't that creepy?

642
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,560
Hey...

643
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:33,190
The neighbors say it's a vengeful ghost.

644
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:36,110
Full of regret for losing her kid

645
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:40,750
Carrying the charred body of a child

646
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:03,370
I looked up Ryu Seong Hui's address, and it's true that the accident occurred on March of 1984.

647
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:07,280
It was on a list of fire deaths reported by the police at the time.

648
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,500
And I confirmed the death certificate at the district office.

649
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:13,880
Are you sure?

650
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:16,950
Back then, there was no such thing as genetic testing.

651
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:22,170
I was told that the body identification was done using her belongings.

652
00:51:22,170 --> 00:51:24,720
Do you have coffee?

653
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,670
By chance, what if Ryu Seong Hui knew how harmful TH-5 was?

654
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:31,620
What if she went out of her way to prevent its commercialization?

655
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:34,870
And what if she was threatened by Seon Hyeon Tae and Professor Park because of it?

656
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:39,090
And what if the fire that day was also  a result of arson?

657
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,080
No matter how vicious those people are, do you really think they would commit murder by arson?

658
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:44,870
In a house with a young child inside?

659
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:49,620
What if Ryu Seong Hui hid after that fire incident? What if she is still alive?

660
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:53,260
She has already been recorded as dead.

661
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:55,550
There is someone who saw her.

662
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:01,860
Where? Who?

663
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:06,850
There were rumors floating around the neighborhood that people were seeing her.

664
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:08,900
Really?

665
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:15,210
Look here, Doctor Lee,

666
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:19,680
If Ryu Seon Hui were still alive, she would have already made an appearance.

667
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:24,010
In Korea, you can't do anything if you don't have a resident registration number.

668
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:27,680
A living person can't vanish without a trace.

669
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:33,550
I'll bet my hand that she is dead.

670
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,780
Clean it up.

671
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:56,090
Thank you! Come on, Mom.

672
00:52:58,050 --> 00:52:59,950
Thank you!

673
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:03,210
Let's go, Mrs. Cha.

674
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:11,910
It's sprained.

675
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:17,090
You'll change and come back down right?

676
00:53:17,090 --> 00:53:20,620
It's not like you're going to be standing there and watching? What?

677
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:24,390
Even so. You said that you're close with that doctor?

678
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:28,260
We are. Very close.

679
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:37,530
What happened to the people who were injured in the construction site explosion last time?

680
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:40,520
They were transferred out of the intensive care unit to the general ward today.

681
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:41,960
Don't worry.

682
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:46,400
You just have to go straight to the ward, hand over the money, take a picture and go.

683
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:54,980
Mom.

684
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:57,300
Get away. It's hot.

685
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:02,020
Why are you being like this? Am I some stranger's son?

686
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,910
Why are you so worried? It's okay. It's okay.

687
00:54:16,910 --> 00:54:20,120
We're almost there.

688
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:23,610
That location is the most important part.

689
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:26,380
All you have to do is talk to him about your symptoms.

690
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:31,490
Chairman.

691
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:35,800
Detective Cha. What brings you here?

692
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:39,020
I'm here for a treatment.

693
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:55,620
 35 years ago.

694
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:58,580
Seong Hui, just talk to me for a second!

695
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:00,690
Hold on for a second Seong Hui!

696
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:12,780
Seong Hee, just let me off this once.

697
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:15,020
My life is on the line here.

698
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,760
Accusation?

699
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,640
Go ahead. Try it.

700
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:30,430
Do you think anyone will listen to you?

701
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:34,940
After we did all of this together. You really want to betray me?

702
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:18,230
Da-Da Som.

703
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:42,740
I was wrong. Please forgive me.

704
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:45,980
I didn't even think about killing the kid.

705
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:48,440
Please believe me.

706
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:06,800
Why are you being like this? I just did what the director told me to do! You know.

707
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,490
Hey! Don't do this!

708
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:39,500
Seong Hui! Seong Hui!

709
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:45,120
No! No! Don't do this.

710
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:31,420
Mom?

711
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:35,530
Mom?

712
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:52,130
-Mom? 
-What?

713
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:56,020
This is Seo Hyeon Tae of Seoryeon Group.

714
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:04,530
Who did you say this was?

715
00:59:07,530 --> 00:59:11,190
This is my mother.

716
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:45,320

717
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:53,620
♫   Some people want to live. But turn their backs on me.  ♫

718
00:59:53,620 --> 01:00:00,190
♫   The time I was not myself  ♫

719
01:00:00,190 --> 01:00:01,990
♫   Some people say to me  ♫

720
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:05,120
 Chimera  
 ♫   Don't go  ♫

721
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:07,720
  You said that accident happened 35 years ago? 
  ♫   She said, don't go   ♫

722
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:12,590
  -Look into Detective Cha 
 -Is this your answer?  
 ♫   Say don't go tonight  ♫

723
01:00:12,590 --> 01:00:14,980
  I just want to know the truth.

724
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:18,640
 Think carefully. About what the right choice is.  
 ♫   Some people say to me, don't go  ♫

725
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:22,410
 A criminal profiler who puts a murderer to bed in her own house 
  ♫   Say don't go  ♫

726
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:23,410
 Thank you.

727
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:27,330
 How can someone who died 35 years ago be alive? 
  ♫   Say don't go tonight  ♫

728
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:30,100
This is the Chief's phone. He just got a message.

729
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:33,390
 He couldn't have just disappeared like that. Something must have happened.
