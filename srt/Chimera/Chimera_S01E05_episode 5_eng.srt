2
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,400
 Chimera

3
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,190
 The characters, locations, incidents, religious sects, etc. in this drama are fiction and have no relation to reality.

4
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,200
Are you warning us of the crime beforehand?

5
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,520
Are you, Lee Jung Yeop, the culprit?

6
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,100
If you're not, do you know who the culprit is?

7
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,960
No.

8
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:00,930
You should not ask who did it but ask first why they did it.

9
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,750
Nothing on this Earth just happens for no reason.

10
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,880
It's memories that make us human

11
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,970
because everything that is happening now is a result of the past.

12
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,630
The past?

13
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,490
What past?

14
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,610
Whose past?

15
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,640
Who...

16
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,770
are you?

17
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,270
That's enough.

18
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,540
I am from Seoryun's legal team.

19
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:07,520
  ~ Episode 5 ~

20
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,850
Sir.

21
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,810
I only brought the important items out of the things that were confiscated with the warrant.

22
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,320
You'll receive the rest of the items and the car back sometime tomorrow morning.

23
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,220
Thank you for your hard work.

24
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:37,520
Ah, your schedule was modified.  Relax today.

25
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,820
Please thank President Lee.

26
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:44,930
I think it would be better if you see her and convey that in person.

27
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,590
Good bye.

28
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,210
 35 years ago, during Lee Jung Seop's childhood

29
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,660
  Combat Espionage 
 Report Spies 113.112

30
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,320
 Final Report

31
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:56,070
It's not raining and it is so damned hot. Seriously.

32
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:03,490
Is it five minutes to 6 o'clock (the angle of his stance)?  Why are you tilting?

33
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,850
Can't you stand straight?

34
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:11,530
Straighten your shoulders and suck in your belly.

35
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,540
Weak punk.

36
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:24,750
The basis of an upright attitude is an upright body.

37
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,200
That is what the left state councilor during King Seonjo's reign,

38
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:32,720
who was the 9th generation of the Dumungongpa of the Hyeongju Bae Clan, said.

39
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,190
Hang onto that thought, punk.

40
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:40,440
Hyeongnim, does he get what you're saying?

41
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,470
Hey, Han Ju Seok.

42
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,200
- Han Ju Seok. 
 - Yes, sir.

43
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,690
Give me that newspaper.

44
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,800
Hey.

45
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,960
Who are you looking for?

46
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,600
My ... dad.

47
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,400
Is that so? Who is your father?

48
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,870
You know, that red commie.

49
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,260
Here.

50
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,820
It's okay.  Take it.

51
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,760
Damn.  He's splattering everywhere.

52
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,210
Ignore that.

53
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,630
When you saw him frantically protesting with bloody foam coming out of his mouth,

54
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:53,420
and he was scared that someone would call him a commie bastard.

55
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,020
That's what is disgusting, right?

56
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:06,660
He is wolfing that down. Really.

57
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,530
Where are you going? I said you can't.

58
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,260
Gosh. I said you can't have credit.

59
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,050
It's not like we don't know each other.  You are too mean.

60
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,660
If I say you can't, then you can't.

61
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,060
Is there someone who won't pay back? You know I will pay.

62
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:25,400
They said the couples are the same. The husband is a murderer and the wife is a thief.

63
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,560
Who did? Who said my child's dad killed?  Who said that?

64
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,660
I-Is there anyone who doesn't know that?

65
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,740
When it's all over the newspapers. Give that back.

66
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,470
Mom. Mom, what's the matter?

67
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,560
Mom, get up.

68
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,790
Mom, what's the matter? Mom.

69
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,200
Really. I mean why, of all places, is she doing this in front of my store?

70
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,590
- Mom, get up. 
 - It's a waste.  I can't use it.

71
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,860
Because we are unlucky, everything bad happens in this neighborhood.

72
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,130
This is so upsetting.  Why of all neighborhoods, did it have to be ours?

73
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:10,800
We can't walk around at night because it's scary.

74
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,160
 Die 
  Red commie. 
 Murderer.

75
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:45,130
Did she die?

76
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,690
I should have sent someone earlier.

77
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,460
So unlucky.

78
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,230
For now, let's take her to the hospital and verify her identity.

79
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,160
We need to follow the reporting of a death procedure.

80
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:02,190
Isn't there a guardian? Any relative?

81
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,750
I don't know.  How would I know?

82
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,700
Her husband is dead and she had a small kid.

83
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:17,630
Mom. Mom.

84
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,110
Mom.

85
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:24,140
- Get out of the way. My goodness. 
 - Mom!

86
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,920
No.  Where are you taking Mom?

87
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,230
Mom, Mom, don't go!

88
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:37,020
Mom. Mom!

89
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:44,290
Mom! Mom! Mom.

 Here's a new message from H

94
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,660
Yes, it's me.

95
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,010
No. I'm fine.

96
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:59,150
Actually, I met someone I wanted to meet.

97
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:38,850
Excuse me! One more bottle here.  One more bottle!

98
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,300
There, there, there.  That's enough.  Let's quit here.

99
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:46,100
You guys are trying to get caught by Team Leader Go.

100
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,330
- We won't get caught. 
 - What?

101
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,980
Well, he releases everyone you arrest.

102
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:57,040
Later, when we don't catch the culprit, we will be the brunt of all the curses.

103
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,830
Damn it, really.  We didn't join violent crime to be doing this.

104
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,610
You know how I feel, right?

105
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:15,260
Drink it all.  Bottom's up.

106
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,230
What's the rich guy's background?

107
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:22,710
This is humiliating.  This is really humiliating.

108
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,180
Investigator, how is it in the US?

109
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,690
This doesn't happen there, does it?

110
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,100
Well.

111
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,740
I don't think it does.  The system is so much better there.

112
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:42,340
I'm jealous.  You live in a nice country.

113
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:48,250
Well, we should leave now.

114
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,900
When did you go to America?

115
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:59,580
When I was so young that I don't even remember.

116
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:05,970
Then, you don't know the parents who gave birth to you?

117
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,540
- Ha Na. 
 - No.

118
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,090
So you came to find your parents here!

119
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:20,750
Enough of that.  Let's go.

120
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:24,450
Do you want me to find out?

121
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:28,820
There's a really persistent seonbae (senior) who's into finding people.

122
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:34,430
No. I don't intend to find them.

123
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:44,160
In any case, looking for biological parents may not be respectful to the parents who raised you.

124
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,930
Right?

125
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:53,290
I see you love the parents who raised you a lot.

126
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:56,290
Wow, so moving.

127
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:01,990
I do love them.  A lot.

128
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,160
You don't have to walk me all the way home.

129
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:25,390
- My house is near here. 
 - Nearby?

130
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:30,430
Yes, across the river there. If you just go over that hill, then you're soon there.

131
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,950
The guys were drunk earlier.

132
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,150
Please understand.  That's the way Koreans are.

133
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:43,550
Shall I say they burst in?  They don't think it's rude to do that.

134
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:46,520
You don't have to try to comfort me.

135
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,020
Huh?

136
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:52,980
Living not knowing the faces of my parents who gave birth to me is not misfortune.

137
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:58,420
That's not what I meant.  I also grew up not knowing what my father looked like.

138
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:05,880
He died before I was born.

139
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,760
After my mom and dad were in a car accident.

140
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,360
My mom and I, in her womb, survived.

141
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,090
So I don't know what my father looked like.

142
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:18,950
My mom couldn't remember anything prior to the accident.

143
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:25,800
She must have been in shock that my father died.

144
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:32,960
A human brain sometimes spontaneously buries its memories.

145
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:38,520
When that memory is too difficult to recall.

146
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:42,620
It's not that the brain cells that remember the incident have died,

147
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:47,520
but they suspend their activities.  As if going into hibernation.

148
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:57,100
I'm saying random things.  It's very late.  Let's go home.

149
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,620
Thanks for escorting me home, but you don't have to do that next time.

150
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,640
I owe you a lot today.

151
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,260
You said what you didn't want to say in order to help me.

152
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,260
I was greedy.

153
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:19,620
I wanted to look into it.  Into that man.

154
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,410
Why?

155
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:25,560
Because I can't read him.

156
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,660
Detective Cha, do you think he is the culprit?

157
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,690
Do you think he isn't?

158
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:39,690
What is the benefit of committing a crime with a chemical? The culprit doesn't have to be at the scene.

159
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:44,060
If he is the culprit, why didn't he create an alibi for himself?

160
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:52,730
Everything is peculiar, that man, the scene of the crime, the body.

161
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:55,560
For everything, it was the first time I laid eyes on it.

162
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,610
This is what I think.

163
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:09,830
If that man isn't the culprit,

164
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:14,800
what if he's someone in pursuit of the culprit?  Just like us.

165
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,240
- Are you home? 
 - Yes.

166
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:42,700
- I'm home. 
 - Did you eat?

167
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,310
Of course, I did.  It's so late.

168
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,190
- Hurry and wash up. 
 - Yeah.

169
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:55,290
- But is your leg sore? 
 - No.

170
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,820
- Here, here. 
 - It's fine.

171
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:03,170
Be still.

172
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:07,100
- Gently, gently. 
 - I haven't even started and you're fussing.

173
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,500
Not there, there, a little lower.

174
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,570
Refreshing.

175
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,710
- Mom. 
 - Yeah?

176
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:29,180
- Aren't you curious? 
 - Huh? About what?

177
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:34,710
What happened in the past.  What you did before the accident and how you lived.

178
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:39,660
You don't remember half of your life, that is not good.

179
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:44,470
If I remembered?   Whether it was rice cake or rice?

180
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:48,130
Maybe there could be relatives somewhere or something similar.

181
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,760
What's the point of finding them?

182
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,650
Perhaps you know?  Among our relatives, could there be chaebols*? ( *Wealthy families owning business conglomerates.)

183
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,990
Relatives, is that what you want?

184
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:05,230
No.  That's not it.

185
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:10,790
Then despite not having any, you lived well without any problems.

186
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:19,220
What is it?  Does the woman you're dating not like that I am a single mother?

187
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,650
I'm not dating anyone.

188
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:29,320
It's just that.  You are alone.

189
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:34,000
I'm not a person who can always be home, and if something were to happen ...

190
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,040
Why are you unnecessarily like that? When have I ever not been alone?

191
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,210
We had Team Leader before.

192
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,220
I need to wash up.

193
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:01,190
Oh, all right.

194
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:14,350
Park Du Yeong, otherwise known as the Sangju-dong Fire Squirrel.

195
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,410
He worked on a demolition crew at a construction site.

196
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:20,790
And in 2012, an explosion at that site caused 20 nearby houses to burn down.

197
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:23,100
And in 2016, he was arrested for arson

198
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:27,430
by Inspector Han Ju Seok and sentenced to prison. But he was released recently.

199
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:32,380
As someone who keeps sending threatening emails and complaining about injustice,

200
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:37,030
he's our most likely suspect right now.

201
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:40,050
- Team Leader 
 - Team 1 will stay hidden around the site.

202
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:43,280
And Team 2 will track the IP addresses associated with the emails.

203
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,480
- Let's start by filling spots on the teams. 
 - Team Leader!

204
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,810
Detective Cho, you can send a letter of cooperation to the relevant authorities.

205
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,450
Sure.

206
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,560
Okay. Let's get going.

207
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,370
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

208
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:03,950
Are we really going to let go of Lee Jung Yeop just like that?

209
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,710
We can at least try to put a tail on him.

210
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:07,760
Are you suggesting an illegal investigation right now?

211
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,680
Don't we have to do something?

212
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:13,210
Since we released him because we couldn't bring charges against him, shouldn't we let it go?

213
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:16,600
Officially, the investigation into Lee Jung Yeop is over.

214
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:22,170
What happens if something goes wrong because we just let him go?

215
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:25,160
What happens if someone else dies?

216
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,270
You're right.

217
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,400
Someone needs to die.

218
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,790
Someone else dying

219
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:41,840
is our only chance at this point.

220
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,980
But the problem is that we don't know when, how, or who is going to die.

221
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:52,240
It would be nice if we could know those things in advance.

222
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,290
I understand.

223
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,870
The investigation team has confiscated a vehicle.

224
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:12,290
Officially, from now on, whatever you do has nothing to do with our investigation team.

225
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,020
Do you understand?

226
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:22,840
I can't offer you any support. You have to do it alone.

227
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:40,620
Oh! Detective Cha.

228
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,650
What's up with your expression?

229
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,040
Is something not working out for you?

230
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:57,240
I heard that there was a warrantless arrest, so I hurried over here but it looks like he was released pretty quickly.

231
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,220
Something must have happened for the arrest to have occurred.

232
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,850
He must have been released because there were no charges brought against him, right?

233
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,740
Have you eaten yet? I'm so hungry.

234
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,100
I already ate.

235
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,600
Where are you going? Should we go together?

236
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:21,340
I'm going to the bathhouse.

237
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:28,180
We're launching an investigative report program called "Search."

238
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:33,220
To commemorate the launch, we're going to deal with some of Korea's most famous unsolved cases.

239
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,060
Unsolved cases?

240
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:39,150
Will people find that interesting? Our society must be sick.

241
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:42,410
It's so that we can re-examine forgotten events.

242
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:46,180
Who knows? New clues might emerge.

243
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:50,560
I sincerely wish you the best. Well, I'll be going then.

244
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:53,770
Chimera.

245
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:56,510
It'll be our first topic.

246
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:08,930
What do you know about the victims of the Chimera incident that occurred 35 years ago?

247
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:11,160
Victims?

248
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:15,310
Those people all worked at the same place.

249
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:23,870
Victims Oh Jong Geun, Im Sang Wuk,

250
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:26,220
Park In Sang.

251
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:29,460
They don't mention their jobs in the article.

252
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:33,440
The first thing to do in a serial killer investigation is to find out what the victims have in common.

253
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,060
Why are the victims' occupations all missing from the article?

254
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,700
Isn't it odd?

255
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,140
Are there only one or two odd things about this case?

256
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:49,260
This newspaper article is from the local news section of a 1984 print.

257
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,030
Since it was a serial murder case, you only looked at the local news section, right?

258
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:55,220
But the information was in the wrong place.

259
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:58,110
In the economic section.

260
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,560
 Economic News 
 Hanmyeong University and Taesam Chemical collaboration

261
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:06,250
Professor Park In Sang's Hanmyeong University research team.

262
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:10,800
Pictured from left to right are researchers Im Sang Wuk and Oh Jong Geun.

263
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,920
University researchers?

264
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:16,540
It's a development project collaboration between the industry and a graduate research team.

265
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,820
All three people who died were from the same research team.

266
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,770
What project was this?

267
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:26,000
It was called TH-5. It was a disinfectant developed and patented in 1984.

268
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,130
There has been a lot of talk about it these days because people have died.

269
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,460
TH-5?

270
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:38,500
These two and this person here are the victims.

271
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:43,010
This is Taesam Chemical Director Seo Hyeon Tae. He was in charge of product development at the time.

272
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:45,110
Seo Hyeon Tae.

273
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:47,010
I feel like I've heard that name a lot somewhere.

274
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:50,220
You don't know Seoryun Group Chairman Seo Hyeon Tae?

275
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,390
Seoryun? The conglomorate company Seoryun?

276
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:57,170
Taesam Chemical merged with Seoryun after their successful product development.

277
00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:01,190
And Seo Hyeon Tae married Lee Hwa Jeong, the princess of Seoryun.

278
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:07,590
You know that suicide case that happened in front of the Seoryun office a little while ago right?

279
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:11,230
You mean the Evergreen case where the victim committed suicide after asking for compensation, right?

280
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:14,420
Do you know what the main ingredient of Evergreen is?

281
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,730
TH-5?

282
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:25,270
Should I tell you something interesting to cool down all the complicated thoughts you're having right now?

283
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:32,080
Do you know who Lee Hwa Jeong's older brother is?

284
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,320
Who is it?

285
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:39,850
The prosecutor who spearheaded the investigation into the Chimera case in 1984.

286
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:42,090
Assemblyman Lee Min Gi.

287
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:55,420
In this case, you have to end it at once. That's for its sake too.

288
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:58,720
You did this all yourself?

289
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,900
Your hobbies are really something too. If I were you, I wouldn't do it because I can't be bothered.

290
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:06,020
Wow.

291
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,650
Rather than carrying a hundred coal briquettes from the village,

292
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:21,220
taking pictures of cooking and posting them

293
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,480
is much more appealing to voters nowadays.

294
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,530
I should learn how to cook too.

295
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:31,920
You can't do that. Your dexterity isn't good enough.

296
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:43,260
Hyeongnim, how is President Lee feeling?

297
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,150
Do you think she'd be happy?

298
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:49,230
I heard that doctor spent all day waiting to be released.

299
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:53,870
Oh, well, the others are catching on.

300
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:56,830
Good going.

301
00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:00,650
Anyway, just bow your head down and definitely beg for forgiveness.

302
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,300
All right.

303
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,660
Here, let's eat.

304
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,950
- You've worked hard. 
 - Thanks.

305
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:31,760
Have some.

306
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,950
Hyeongsunim, please relax now.

307
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:56,380
I really committed a sin and deserve to die.   Please have a drink.

308
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,600
Thank you.

309
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,580
Let's drink.

310
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:33,180
I mean, the guys under me did whatever they wanted at dawn without telling me.

311
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:37,800
I scolded the investigation team a lot so please don't be too angry.

312
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,560
I heard they made him suffer until he was released at nearly sunset.

313
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,030
Do young kids listen to anyone nowadays?

314
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,920
They are self-centered and do whatever they please.

315
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,790
They are killing me.

316
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,580
Good going.

317
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:54,300
Which case is it that there is such a fuss?

318
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,580
That's ...

319
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:01,780
Someone in our department died. It is a murder.

320
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:05,500
An officer was murdered? Who?

321
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,200
The one on the verge of retirement?  That police officer?

322
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:13,120
My goodness.  How did he end up being murdered? How was it done?

323
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,280
It's similar to chemical terrorism.

324
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:20,780
They say the method is unique and something strange was found at the scene.

325
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,700
What was found?

326
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,170
A lighter.

327
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:31,920
A lighter?

328
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:36,390
Yes.  Wasn't the same pattern in the chimera case

329
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,890
thirty-five years ago?

330
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,700
What happened? Are you drunk already?

331
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,330
I'm not drunk. I didn't drink that much.

332
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:58,260
In any case, there are too many things on your mind now.  Please drink in moderation.

333
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:02,060
When the three of you get together, you think you're young again.

334
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:29,550
What do you mean by chimera lighter? Tell us the details.

335
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:37,790
There was a case in 1984 for which Hyeongnim Min Gi led the investigation.

336
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:40,630
Right after you were assigned to the Ministry of Public Security.

337
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:44,460
The serial arson murder case in Macheon City.

338
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:49,090
The name of the culprit was Lee Sang Wu, right?

339
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:54,420
The MO used in the recent cases is identical.

340
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,980
There were two explosions, and after each, there was someone dead, and

341
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:00,260
a lighter with a chimera design turned up at the scene.

342
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,820
Who are the people who died?

343
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:07,970
One was a reporter who covered the Chimera case.

344
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:12,350
The other was Han Ju Seok. He was a detective who worked on the case at the time.

345
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:18,270
It's hard to ignore it as just a coincidence.

346
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:24,320
Couldn't it be a copycat or some similar imitator?

347
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,740
How would he know the MO of a case from 35 years ago?

348
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:30,990
Both Min Gi, who was the prosecutor in charge, and I don't know.

349
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:41,360
But, how is that Seoryun doctor involved?

350
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,250
I heard he was caught on the CCTV loitering around the scenes of the incidents.

351
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:47,760
He hasn't been cleared of suspicion nor charged, but it's not clear.

352
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,240
What kind of person is he? Did you see him?

353
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,820
He looks fine and he's smart.

354
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:55,300
He is Korean-British.

355
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,880
He's Korean?

356
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,050
Yes, an adopted child.

357
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:01,190
Adopted child?

358
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,860
His name?

359
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:06,980
Lee Jung Yeop. Is it a name you know?

360
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:09,610
Not really, I'm hearing it for the first time.

361
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:15,740
Hwa Jeong brought him here at great expense.  He couldn't be the culprit.

362
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,690
I guess so.

363
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:22,090
But something doesn't feel right.

364
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:27,100
What are you afraid of? What are you worried about?

365
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:30,280
The Chimera died.

366
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,160
Thirty-five years ago.

367
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,300
The progress looks good.

368
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:49,200
Because my primary doctor is good looking, I guess the medical treatment is effective.

369
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,110
Don't you have any information

370
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:57,100
other than the three syllables of the name of the person

371
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,340
you asked me to search for before, Ham Yong Bok?

372
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,980
I think he might be in his 60's now.

373
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:05,000
He was a government employee at the Macheon police station thirty-five years ago.

374
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,720
A detective?

375
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,740
He's not easy to find, is he?

376
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:13,620
If he's an ex-detective, I can find him after crossing several bridges.

377
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:16,440
I may be pointlessly putting you through the trouble.

378
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,510
What do you mean trouble?  It's a chance for me to pay my debt to you.

379
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:26,600
I'm responsible for your having to suffer being taken to the police station.

380
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,930
I don't blame you.

381
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,850
Jeez.

382
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:37,860
How can I tell if you're sincere or not?

383
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,440
But who is that person?

384
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,680
Family?

385
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,950
or an enemy?

386
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:00,240
I just have some questions to ask that person.

387
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,780
Doctor Lee.

388
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:14,570
As someone who is going to die, can I give you some advice?

389
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:15,940
It's not a fatal disease.

390
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:20,010
- If you take your medicine and take good care of yourself—
 - Don't look back at the past.

391
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:22,350
There's nothing to gain.

392
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:30,760
You're healthy, handsome and have a great job.

393
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,210
Is it because you're lacking something?

394
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:39,170
Without regard to age, country, time and place, is there someone who benefitted from turning back to look at the past?

395
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,990
Doctor Lee,

396
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:50,180
even if you can find your enemy, you can't find your family.

397
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,920
The instant you search, they become an enemy.

398
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:08,710
Let's say you are sitting and facing a suspect in the interrogation room.

399
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:11,400
What should you say first?

400
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,920
Option 1.  What's the best memory of your life?

401
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,710
Option 2.  What's your worst memory?

402
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:21,020
What's your choice between the two questions?

403
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:24,420
The answer is option 2.

404
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:28,510
No one answers if I ask about what they enjoyed or liked.

405
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,970
But if you ask about the worst memories,

406
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:36,250
it's a startling experience in which the adversary suddenly can't utter a word.

407
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,350
I have a question.

408
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:46,790
There are situations in which an innocent person makes a false confession.

409
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:49,210
Why is that?

410
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:53,780
Because of a coercive atmosphere?

411
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:57,340
Because of physical threats such as torture?

412
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,210
What do you think is the reason?

413
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:08,880
An innocent person makes a false confession.

414
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:14,420
Anyone can do that.

415
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:17,940
They aren't mentally abnormal. Nor is it coerced.

416
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,390
Are you saying a false confession is made even without coercion?

417
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:26,000
They may be deprived of physical freedom and intensely interrogated about their worries and concerns.

418
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,180
There also may be complex circumstances which may cause harm to their family.

419
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,500
They may not know how long the situation will last.

420
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,450
If that happens, there is overwhelming stress.

421
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:41,120
So they just want to simply and quickly escape from that situation.

422
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,600
So that person thinks, "let's just give the answer they want."

423
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,710
Is that all of it?

424
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:55,960
I mean, it's not like they are stupid, what happens when they confess and get punished?

425
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,250
No way.

426
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,900
They think, "when I go to court, the truth will be revealed."

427
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,930
They do not realize how fatal that mistake is.

428
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:16,010
Things that ordinary people usually cannot imagine happen in the interrogation room.

429
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:21,060
They are out of touch with reality about the punishment which will be handed out.

430
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:26,240
Even if it is the court's severest sentence, the death penalty.

431
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:40,800
Miss Eugene, can we talk briefly?

432
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,740
I don't think there's any reason for us to talk privately.

433
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:49,360
"Until a final judgment has been rendered, do not interact personally with the defendant."

434
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:53,410
"You may become biased."  It's a profiler's rule.

435
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:55,290
You're very knowledgeable.

436
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:59,620
Then instead of interaction, let's do something else.

437
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,350
Something else?

438
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:04,620
Do you like chess?

439
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,890
White.  I go first, right?

440
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,110
Aren't you afraid?

441
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:24,440
Of what?

442
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,120
Being alone with me.

443
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,850
What if I was a real serial killer?

444
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:36,500
It's an honor. If I write a book later on, it will be a best-seller.

445
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:41,460
Til what age did you live in Korea?

446
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,650
Seven years old.

447
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,910
That's old enough to remember what you did when you were young.

448
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:51,850
Such as about your parents here.

449
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:58,270
They are dead.

450
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:02,280
I found my mother's body.  (  In English )

451
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,980
What about your father. (  In English )

452
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:15,160
Where was he when your mother died?  (  In English )

453
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,120
He was killed.  (  In English )

454
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:29,670
What happened?

455
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:39,770
Something that was out of my control.

456
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:44,270
Because I was powerless, I couldn't do anything but suffer.

457
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,630
What's the real reason you came to Korea?

458
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:54,820
When you have no family left.

459
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:57,720
I can't believe that you came here for money.

460
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:01,750
Can you promise me one thing?

461
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:05,270
That you will keep our conversation private?

462
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,280
I promise.

463
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:14,290
I came here because there is something I must do.

464
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:18,500
What is it?

465
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:25,680
Can you help me?

466
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,440
How could I?

467
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:34,250
Don't lose me. That's all you have to do.

468
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,460
Is this suicide?

469
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:53,620
Or a trap?

470
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:57,610
Miss Eugene, why did you come to Korea?

471
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:02,840
Because I made a mistake and I was forced to leave. At my boss's recommendation.

472
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,040
Good excuse.

473
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,690
Why do you think it's an excuse?

474
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:13,670
Didn't you honestly want to find your roots?

475
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:16,420
Who I am now is what defines me.

476
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:19,150
Why would I need the past?

477
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:32,260
Why is it me of all people?  There are many other good detectives.

478
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,600
I needed a friend.

479
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:40,730
I thought you also would need a friend.

480
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,700
Mr. Lee Jung Yeop.

481
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:55,020
You left Korea thirty-five years ago in 1984, right?

482
00:43:57,290 --> 00:44:00,060
Did something happen then?

483
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,820
You're way ahead of me.

484
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:08,220
Sometimes, other than the facts,  look at the person.

485
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:20,050
Checkmate. (  In English )

486
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:31,450
 Dearest Eugene 
 Merry Christmas and best wishes in all you do. I am always there for you. Love, Sam

487
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:34,320
  Happy Birthday Eugene

 Adoption UK RE: Adoption Record Jerome J. Y. Edwards

489
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:05,100
 Dear Eugene Hathaway, 
 I recently received an email that you requested an adoption record certificate ...

490
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:11,250
 The attached file below is the adoption record of Lee Jung Yeop's adoption record certificate.

491
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,800
 Adoption record certificate.

492
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:20,780
 Name: Lee Jung Yeop 
 Birth Date: 11-22-77

493
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:23,160
 Admission Date:  9-21-84 
 From: Somang-ui Bit Orphanage, 15, Nogsu-u Youn San-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea

494
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,900
 Family: orphan

 New Message 
 Mrs. Hwang

497
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:03,920
 Doctor Lee, call me when you see this message.  I figured out where Ham Yong Bok is.

498
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:16,900
- Where should we go? 
 - Where do you want to go?

499
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:19,780
I got all dressed up. Let's go to the beach.

500
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:22,090
You want to see the beach?

501
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:26,350
I guess he's here to play.

502
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:29,320
It'll be a long wait until they open.

503
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:35,560
Mister.  Is that your car?

504
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:39,800
You can't park there. Move it.

505
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,100
I'm looking for someone.

506
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:43,670
Who is it?

507
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:47,110
His name is Ham Yong Bok. He used to be a police officer in Macheon City.

508
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:49,460
Oh, it's this man here–

509
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:51,320
What am I thinking?

510
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:55,090
I completely forgot I have dinner plans.  Go home.

511
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:58,410
What about our drive?

512
00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:02,610
If I tell you to go into the house, you go. Talkative wench.

513
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:04,930
Okay.

514
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:20,660
Who are you looking for?

515
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:22,530
Mr. Ham Yong Bok.

516
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:26,150
In the 80's he was at the Macheon Police Station.

517
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,900
I think I've heard of him, but then I think maybe not.

518
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:34,190
I was told he lived here.

519
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:37,140
It's not just one or two people who come and go around here.

520
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:41,220
What is it?  Why are you looking for him?

521
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:47,480
I have a question to ask him.

522
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:53,740
About the Chimera case thirty-five years ago. About Lee Sang Wu who died then.

523
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:01,300
Well, I don't know what you're talking about.

524
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,750
It would be better to ask the manager when he comes to work.

525
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:10,060
Oh, yes.  Thank you.

526
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:49,530
Here it is, 1984.  1984 Adoption Registry

527
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:55,520
At the time, about 20,000 children were adopted abroad.

528
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:59,620
In the 1980s there was a private adoption agency.

529
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:04,760
While it was closing the date for many cases were lost.

530
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:10,660
Even if the adopted people want to find their birth families, there is no information.

531
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:14,930
In such cases, it's very unfortunate for us.

532
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:17,240
I see.

533
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:28,120
Oh, it's here! Lee Jung Yeop.

534
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:32,330
 Juvenile Care Ledger

535
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,420
 Name:  Lee Jung Yeop

536
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:39,550
Is Lee Jung Yeop his real name?

537
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:45,230
If it was his name when he came from the orphanage, I think it probably is his real name.

538
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:49,730
In the case of infants, we give arbitrary names to the child

539
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:54,060
but a seven year old can write his own name.

540
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,000
 Family relations 
 Father: Deceased 
 Mother: Deceased

541
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,680
Both parents allegedly had died.

542
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:07,320
Yes.  Under the law, adoption abroad was not permitted for children with living parents.

543
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:15,240
Is this, perhaps, everything?

544
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:18,660
What about the names of his parent or the name of the neighborhood he lived in before?

545
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:23,560
If it's not written down here, there's no way for us to know.

546
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:25,640
I am sorry.

547
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,440
I see.

548
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:40,270
Did you eat well?

549
00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:42,960
- I really enjoyed the food, Hyeongnim. 
 - You are welcome.

550
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:46,220
Go home.

551
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:48,340
Please go safely.

552
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,190
Hyeongnim, have a safe trip home.

553
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:55,450
Who are you?

554
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,170
It's better to answer.  That's how you can live.

555
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:04,300
I asked who are you?

556
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:11,520
This bastard! See the look in his eyes!

557
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:14,910
That's scary.

558
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:18,320
You're not going to answer who you are?

559
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:37,760
Does this mean you won't answer?

560
00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:42,070
Then ...

561
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:51,490
See this? If you aren't saying anything—

562
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:09,390
I'm the police.  Don't move.

563
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:25,860
Attention!  I'm saying it just once, so listen carefully.

564
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:28,920
Everyone is under arrest

565
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,660
on charges of assault, arson, and attempted murder.

566
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:35,600
If you cooperate, there will be a reduction in the length of your sentence.

567
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,040
Please keep that in mind, huh?

568
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:45,120
The police?

569
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:48,090
Police come when everything is over.

570
00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:51,080
Why have you arrived so early?

571
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:04,880
Hey, stay still! Hey.

572
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,550
Don't move, punks. I told you I'm the police.

573
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:13,470
The early bird ... gets beat up early.

574
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:20,390
What are you doing? Grab the bird.

575
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:24,530
Don't come. Don't come or you'll really die. You'll die!

576
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:27,760
Die. Die. Die.

577
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,120
You punks ...

578
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,430
Hey.

579
00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:33,320
- You're driving me nuts. 
 - Hit him.

580
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:57,070
Hold on, hold on.

581
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:01,810
- My ribs. 
 - What?

582
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:04,590
You think government authority is dog crap.

583
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:40,620
Get up! Damn it!

584
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:52,350
Hey, bastard.

585
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,700
Because you're the police, do you think you are some kind of government official?

586
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:22,550
What's that?

587
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:36,880
The car!

588
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:45,320
Fire. Fire.

589
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,610
Fire. Fire.

590
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:11,330
Chimera.

591
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:26,900

592
01:01:44,190 --> 01:01:46,930
 Chimera.

593
01:01:46,930 --> 01:01:51,800
  What happened on August 8, 1984, the day Lee Sang Wu died?

594
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,490
 Did you kill him?

595
01:01:53,490 --> 01:01:56,970
 The Chimera Case 35 years ago is the root cause of what's happening now.

596
01:01:56,970 --> 01:01:58,780
 You didn't say stupid things because you were scared, did you?

597
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:02,130
 Didn't you say you would be responsible for everything which happened that day?

598
01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:04,260
 Please help me find someone.

599
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:05,220
  Who?

600
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:06,770
 Those who survived.

601
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:10,220
 What kind of detective are you?

602
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:12,580
 If Lee Sang Wu was not the chimera,

603
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:16,330
 then who is the real chimera?
