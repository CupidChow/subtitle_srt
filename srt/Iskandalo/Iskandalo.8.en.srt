1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,587
Do you think
I don't know the truth?

2
00:00:04,612 --> 00:00:05,238
What do you know?

3
00:00:05,263 --> 00:00:06,807
You two were
having an affair!

4
00:00:06,832 --> 00:00:09,076
But I never confronted
you about it.

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,640
Damn you, Stephen.

6
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,517
If you can cheat,
so can I.

7
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:19,060
Did you order him killed?

8
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,529
I'll make sure
to put you in jail.

9
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:23,106
I can still do
something about it,

10
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:24,874
but the thing is,
what's in it for me?

11
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:25,900
- Elaine--
- You animal!

12
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:28,153
You're the guy
in the sex scandal!

13
00:00:28,178 --> 00:00:29,780
This is a big scandal, Mr. Congressman.

14
00:01:22,906 --> 00:01:23,692
Here.

15
00:01:24,765 --> 00:01:26,361
- Yeah.
- Wow!

16
00:01:27,622 --> 00:01:29,223
- Do you like it?
- Yes!

17
00:01:29,248 --> 00:01:30,374
It's beautiful.

18
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:32,242
Really?

19
00:01:34,045 --> 00:01:35,162
I want to...

20
00:01:36,743 --> 00:01:37,998
make you happy.

21
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,676
I don't want to be cheesy,

22
00:01:41,344 --> 00:01:43,086
but I really missed you.

23
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:45,547
I missed you, too.

24
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:50,061
Go ahead.

25
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:02,990
Hello?

26
00:02:04,116 --> 00:02:05,034
Yes.

27
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,530
I just arrived in Bohol.

28
00:02:11,624 --> 00:02:13,408
I'm about to check in.

29
00:02:16,156 --> 00:02:16,920
Sure.

30
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:22,084
I'll call you once
I get a better reception.

31
00:02:22,585 --> 00:02:23,393
Alright.

32
00:02:24,492 --> 00:02:25,354
Okay.

33
00:03:27,861 --> 00:03:29,111
It's cold!

34
00:03:30,369 --> 00:03:31,455
Come here!

35
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,047
I look gorgeous in this photo.

36
00:03:34,072 --> 00:03:35,799
But you always look gorgeous.

37
00:03:36,127 --> 00:03:37,551
Stop flattering me!

38
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:42,556
I wish things were always this easy.

39
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,183
Right?

40
00:03:46,177 --> 00:03:49,813
Just look at our photo
whenever you miss me.

41
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,357
But I'm always missing you.

42
00:04:10,978 --> 00:04:12,283
Come hug me so you don't drown

43
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:34,543
ROOM 713.

44
00:10:34,543 --> 00:10:36,503
DON'T LEAVE ME HANGING.

45
00:10:36,528 --> 00:10:40,824
I'LL MAKE SURE I'LL
GET TO TASTE YOU.

46
00:10:46,263 --> 00:10:47,556
So, I heard you got shot.

47
00:10:48,098 --> 00:10:49,966
Be careful next time.

48
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:57,115
I entrusted you this case...

49
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,117
because you wanted
to prove something, right?

50
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:02,704
The first thing you need to do
is to obey me!

51
00:11:25,067 --> 00:11:28,254
You should take it easy, Patricia.

52
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,858
You'll end up an old maid
if you continue acting like that.

53
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:37,639
You know that I’ve
always wanted to screw you.

54
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:57,450
Are you hesitant?

55
00:11:58,198 --> 00:12:02,055
Among all the girls I've slept with,
you're the only one who made me wait.

56
00:12:04,365 --> 00:12:05,500
What took you so long?

57
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,045
I just needed to fix something.

58
00:12:13,129 --> 00:12:16,928
Those women know that,
I don’t take no for an answer.

59
00:12:23,964 --> 00:12:27,747
You know I've always wanted to fuck you.

60
00:12:28,618 --> 00:12:29,832
Save that for later.

61
00:12:30,701 --> 00:12:32,418
But we don't have time!

62
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,338
Let's do this.

63
00:12:35,729 --> 00:12:37,490
Can't you wait?

64
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,787
You want to take over Trent's case, right?

65
00:12:44,219 --> 00:12:46,624
As well as Em's.

66
00:12:48,093 --> 00:12:49,394
Then do as I say.

67
00:12:51,698 --> 00:12:52,783
Come on!

68
00:12:55,952 --> 00:12:57,287
What are you laughing at?

69
00:12:57,738 --> 00:12:58,803
What's funny?

70
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:01,057
Come on!

71
00:13:07,774 --> 00:13:10,581
It's time to pay for all your offenses.

72
00:13:10,726 --> 00:13:11,909
Motherfucker!

73
00:13:11,934 --> 00:13:12,792
Give that to me!

74
00:13:15,591 --> 00:13:16,738
What do you want?

75
00:13:18,432 --> 00:13:20,033
Your time is up, Pastrana.

76
00:13:20,263 --> 00:13:21,718
Bullshit! Give me that!

77
00:13:22,122 --> 00:13:23,094
Give it.

78
00:13:23,963 --> 00:13:26,556
Do you remember
the secretary that you raped..

79
00:13:26,763 --> 00:13:28,224
and was later on called a liar?

80
00:13:28,249 --> 00:13:29,767
Do you know what you're doing?

81
00:13:32,096 --> 00:13:35,898
You're under arrest for sexual harrassment
and for the rape of Angel Manaclang.

82
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,717
Put handcuffs on him.

83
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,278
Do you know what's going
to happen to all of you?

84
00:13:40,303 --> 00:13:41,846
You have the right to remain silent.

85
00:13:41,871 --> 00:13:44,866
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

86
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:46,150
Come on.

87
00:13:46,175 --> 00:13:47,410
You set me up.

88
00:13:47,435 --> 00:13:49,537
Bring him to the headquarters
for inquest proceeding.

89
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,898
I'll get back at you, Patricia!

90
00:13:53,179 --> 00:13:54,484
Are you okay, Agent Esguerra?

91
00:13:55,651 --> 00:13:56,588
I'm okay.

92
00:13:56,841 --> 00:13:57,759
I'll go ahead.

93
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,463
I admit,

94
00:14:17,594 --> 00:14:19,317
I am the guy in the sex scandal.

95
00:14:19,342 --> 00:14:20,318
But sir--

96
00:14:20,436 --> 00:14:22,271
Mr. Congressman!

97
00:14:22,304 --> 00:14:24,489
Is it true that you knocked her up?

98
00:14:25,962 --> 00:14:27,421
How could  you do that, sir?

99
00:14:27,446 --> 00:14:28,701
What was your  wife's reaction?

100
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:33,856
I knew that what Em and I had was wrong,

101
00:14:33,898 --> 00:14:34,832
especially...

102
00:14:35,715 --> 00:14:37,418
since I am  a married man.

103
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,280
But I love Em.

104
00:14:44,043 --> 00:14:46,302
It was too painful for me...

105
00:14:47,197 --> 00:14:48,788
to find out..

106
00:14:50,104 --> 00:14:54,644
that our child also died with her.

107
00:14:54,736 --> 00:14:58,014
But Mr. Congressman, who do
you think uploaded the sex scandal?

108
00:14:58,379 --> 00:14:59,690
You know what, Jessica,

109
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:05,972
only my political nemesis would do that.

110
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:11,661
The election is just  around the
corner, so black propaganda are rampant.

111
00:15:16,512 --> 00:15:18,860
Just a reminder to my opponents:

112
00:15:21,582 --> 00:15:22,833
I am your enemy.

113
00:15:23,103 --> 00:15:24,324
Face no one but me.

114
00:15:25,244 --> 00:15:27,593
Don't drag innocent people into this mess.

115
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:36,085
To Em's detractors,

116
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,465
I'm telling you,

117
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,358
I'll bring you down.

118
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:44,385
You're messing with the wrong person.

119
00:15:46,352 --> 00:15:48,391
What was your wife's reaction?

120
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,866
Turn it off.

121
00:15:58,038 --> 00:16:01,043
This guy is really provoking me.

122
00:17:07,853 --> 00:17:09,779
That's enough.

123
00:17:10,431 --> 00:17:12,365
You've drank too much.

124
00:17:12,418 --> 00:17:14,867
Can you just leave me alone?

125
00:17:17,474 --> 00:17:19,147
Enough with the drama.

126
00:17:19,653 --> 00:17:20,731
It doesn't fit you.

127
00:17:24,435 --> 00:17:26,779
You have no idea what I'm going through.

128
00:17:28,957 --> 00:17:30,041
I do.

129
00:17:31,058 --> 00:17:32,577
That's why I went here.

130
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:37,039
Belinda, you don't have to be alone.

131
00:17:38,186 --> 00:17:39,417
I'm here for you.

132
00:18:03,057 --> 00:18:04,083
Patricia,

133
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,112
props to you for taking care
of my daughter.

134
00:18:11,072 --> 00:18:16,078
I immediately ran to her
after watching Stephen's interview.

135
00:18:17,338 --> 00:18:19,624
That son of a bitch,

136
00:18:20,888 --> 00:18:25,254
flaunting his mistress on national TV.

137
00:18:27,463 --> 00:18:28,464
Enough of it.

138
00:18:29,731 --> 00:18:32,220
I don't want to talk about that guy.

139
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,431
I heard what happened to Director Pastrana.

140
00:18:36,792 --> 00:18:39,869
I'll make sure to put him in jail.

141
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:43,372
A lot of his rape victims
have come forward to testify against him.

142
00:18:43,867 --> 00:18:45,243
I'll handle it, sir.

143
00:18:45,651 --> 00:18:49,320
No, dear. Let me take care of it.

144
00:18:50,816 --> 00:18:54,033
Your dad asked me to
take care of you, Patricia.

145
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:57,161
Not on my watch.

146
00:18:58,127 --> 00:19:00,998
He was a straight arrow.

147
00:19:02,592 --> 00:19:05,753
But he also had a case.

148
00:19:17,703 --> 00:19:19,225
Elaine, may I come in?

149
00:19:20,735 --> 00:19:22,687
I just want us to talk.

150
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:25,940
If it's okay with you.

151
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,318
Elaine, please.

152
00:19:30,776 --> 00:19:32,196
I will change, I promise.

153
00:19:33,479 --> 00:19:34,507
Please.

154
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:37,285
I can't forgive you.

155
00:19:38,471 --> 00:19:41,372
I can't stand being with you.

156
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,851
But if you're serious about...

157
00:19:46,221 --> 00:19:49,313
winning me back, then prove it.

158
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:52,108
Make me realize that
you have indeed changed.

159
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,697
Sir...

160
00:19:58,471 --> 00:20:00,366
Did he tell you anything about it?

161
00:20:01,015 --> 00:20:04,036
I remember him telling me that...

162
00:20:04,685 --> 00:20:08,040
he was just framed up.

163
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,985
He might have told you about it.

164
00:20:11,734 --> 00:20:16,324
We never talked about the cases he handled.

165
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:20,302
Do you know about the Samaniego gang?

166
00:20:20,629 --> 00:20:26,292
Hang on, is this related to Em's case?

167
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:29,395
No, sir.

168
00:20:30,306 --> 00:20:31,797
It's not.

169
00:20:32,989 --> 00:20:36,385
But it is connected to my dad's case.

170
00:20:37,663 --> 00:20:39,305
I don't know anything about it.

171
00:20:42,404 --> 00:20:44,435
They are well protected...

172
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,313
and well connected.

173
00:20:50,064 --> 00:20:52,276
You know what happened to your dad.

174
00:20:55,996 --> 00:20:59,533
I don't want
the same thing to happen to you.

175
00:21:03,984 --> 00:21:05,706
I understand your concern, sir.

176
00:21:07,818 --> 00:21:09,585
I'm just reminding you.

177
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:20,262
I'm sorry, sir. Excuse me.

178
00:21:22,534 --> 00:21:23,577
Hello, Armand?

179
00:21:23,887 --> 00:21:26,894
Patricia, we have an emergency.
You need to go here.

180
00:21:28,396 --> 00:21:29,397
Okay.

181
00:21:31,046 --> 00:21:31,916
Sir,

182
00:21:33,204 --> 00:21:36,504
I need to go to the headquarters.

183
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:40,282
Alright, dear. Let me take care of Belinda.

184
00:21:41,986 --> 00:21:43,093
Take care.

185
00:21:44,123 --> 00:21:45,554
Thank you, sir.

186
00:22:01,145 --> 00:22:02,446
Agent Esguerra,

187
00:22:03,149 --> 00:22:04,907
I need your team to look after me.

188
00:22:04,932 --> 00:22:06,657
I might be killed next.

189
00:22:06,879 --> 00:22:08,285
Are you living alone?

190
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:10,162
I live with my family

191
00:22:10,978 --> 00:22:12,706
but I don't want to put them in danger.

192
00:22:13,306 --> 00:22:14,390
Don't worry.

193
00:22:14,721 --> 00:22:16,752
Our agents will look after you

194
00:22:17,198 --> 00:22:18,738
to make sure that you're safe.

195
00:22:22,391 --> 00:22:24,258
Take care of Ms. Arabella.

196
00:22:24,283 --> 00:22:25,801
- Yes, ma'am.
- Keep an eye on her.

197
00:22:25,826 --> 00:22:27,012
Yes, ma'am.

198
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,515
Thank you, ma'am.

199
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:31,100
No problem.

200
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:34,311
I'll just check on you from time to time.

201
00:22:34,336 --> 00:22:36,712
- That's right.
- I really appreciate your help.

202
00:22:36,737 --> 00:22:37,731
Go and take a rest.

203
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:55,149
You're leaving?

204
00:22:58,776 --> 00:23:00,362
Please, don't leave me.

205
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,284
Belinda,

206
00:23:05,824 --> 00:23:07,261
don't you understand?

207
00:23:07,907 --> 00:23:08,971
I don't want this anymore.

208
00:23:09,486 --> 00:23:10,890
This won't work out.

209
00:23:11,288 --> 00:23:13,709
No. Let's fix this.

210
00:23:15,876 --> 00:23:17,336
There's nothing to fix.

211
00:23:17,823 --> 00:23:18,939
Let's end this.

212
00:23:19,747 --> 00:23:21,317
Don't make this hard for you.

213
00:23:25,631 --> 00:23:26,889
Stephen!

214
00:23:53,013 --> 00:23:55,182
You can win her, for sure!

215
00:23:55,207 --> 00:23:56,375
I hope so!

216
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,277
Okay, let me try.

217
00:23:58,302 --> 00:23:59,428
Okay.

218
00:23:59,595 --> 00:24:00,563
Sir, have some coffee first.

219
00:24:00,588 --> 00:24:02,231
Thank you, miss!

220
00:24:02,256 --> 00:24:03,983
Tasty!

221
00:24:04,008 --> 00:24:05,050
This is perfect.

222
00:24:05,134 --> 00:24:06,218
Are you single?

223
00:24:06,521 --> 00:24:09,265
- I just broke up with my boyfriend.
- He's single.

224
00:24:34,623 --> 00:24:36,308
You surprised me.

225
00:24:38,265 --> 00:24:40,893
You need to pay me double, okay?

226
00:24:40,918 --> 00:24:42,481
Take off your pants.

227
00:24:42,751 --> 00:24:43,679
Hold on.

228
00:24:44,102 --> 00:24:45,963
My safe for this hope, okay?

229
00:24:47,011 --> 00:24:48,012
Come on.

230
00:25:09,804 --> 00:25:10,968
Hurry up!

231
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,856
Hurry up!

232
00:25:26,668 --> 00:25:28,027
You’re the one who’s rushing me.

233
00:26:08,542 --> 00:26:10,620
More! Hurry up!

234
00:26:12,191 --> 00:26:14,348
- You slut!
- Ow!

235
00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:15,991
- What are you doing?
- Fuck!

236
00:26:18,081 --> 00:26:19,074
Wait!

237
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,183
Em is gone because of you!

238
00:26:21,394 --> 00:26:22,972
- I'll kill you!
- Help!

239
00:26:29,645 --> 00:26:30,906
- Help!
- It's ma'am!

240
00:26:32,523 --> 00:26:33,510
Help me!

241
00:26:33,535 --> 00:26:34,637
What happened?!

242
00:26:34,717 --> 00:26:37,136
Agatha is upstairs!
She's going to kill me!

243
00:26:37,161 --> 00:26:38,329
Let's go!

244
00:26:51,081 --> 00:26:51,985
Oh my god!

245
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,240
Where is she?!

246
00:26:57,306 --> 00:26:59,058
She was here a while ago.

247
00:26:59,058 --> 00:27:00,853
- Check downstairs!
- I don't know!

248
00:27:02,436 --> 00:27:04,355
She was here!

249
00:27:08,609 --> 00:27:11,421
Bring her to our safehouse.

250
00:27:12,462 --> 00:27:16,135
We'll let her stay there
while we look for Agatha, okay?

251
00:27:16,293 --> 00:27:17,344
Update me.

252
00:27:17,639 --> 00:27:18,706
Thank you.

253
00:27:27,561 --> 00:27:31,775
Hey, Belinda.
What's this? A late night talk?

254
00:27:31,892 --> 00:27:36,280
Patricia, I'm sorry,
this is embarrassing...

255
00:27:36,793 --> 00:27:38,198
Tell me what happened.

256
00:27:38,353 --> 00:27:39,491
Where are you?

257
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:41,785
I'm not at home.

258
00:27:42,246 --> 00:27:43,579
Then where are you?!

259
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:53,280
I'm at the police station.

260
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:54,631
What?!

261
00:27:55,531 --> 00:27:58,010
Please don't tell Dad.

262
00:27:58,612 --> 00:28:00,554
Pick me up, please.

263
00:28:01,328 --> 00:28:04,249
Okay, fine. Wait for me.

264
00:28:09,978 --> 00:28:11,605
Ms. Belinda, does Mr. Congressman
know about this?

265
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:13,841
Ms. Belinda, is it true that a male
escort has filed a case against you

266
00:28:13,841 --> 00:28:17,321
who you paid to have sex with
you and you almost killed him?

267
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:24,644
Stay away from her!
She's not going to say anything!

268
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:27,873
Go away. Chief!
Control the crowd, will you?!

269
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,563
Are you okay?

270
00:28:31,662 --> 00:28:34,588
Ma'am, do you know
why we arrested her?

271
00:28:34,666 --> 00:28:36,376
Chief, whatever that was,

272
00:28:36,503 --> 00:28:38,634
I'm sure it was just a misunderstanding.

273
00:28:38,993 --> 00:28:40,928
She was reported by the guy over there.

274
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,141
She paid him to have sex with her...

275
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:48,669
but she almost killed him.

276
00:28:55,256 --> 00:28:57,444
If I were you,
I'd just settle this with him...

277
00:28:58,193 --> 00:29:00,078
so he won't file a case.

278
00:29:00,103 --> 00:29:02,157
Looks like he's willing to settle, anyway.

279
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:04,826
Okay, chief.

280
00:29:05,462 --> 00:29:06,453
Hold on.

281
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:09,373
Hold on.

282
00:29:09,827 --> 00:29:10,874
Take a seat first.

283
00:29:18,672 --> 00:29:20,008
Why are you doing this?

284
00:29:20,329 --> 00:29:21,414
What do you want?

285
00:29:21,439 --> 00:29:22,552
Bold of you to ask me that.

286
00:29:23,874 --> 00:29:25,831
Your friend almost killed me.

287
00:29:29,257 --> 00:29:30,175
Yes,

288
00:29:30,357 --> 00:29:31,979
she can be dominating.

289
00:29:32,514 --> 00:29:34,940
You mean she's a killer?

290
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:36,942
I want her jailed!

291
00:29:37,267 --> 00:29:37,976
Okay.

292
00:29:39,034 --> 00:29:41,822
But you're aware of how rotten
our justice system is, right?

293
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:44,683
This will take forever.

294
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:47,269
If you're lucky,

295
00:29:48,115 --> 00:29:49,997
you'll get justice in just a year.

296
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,833
But if you're not,

297
00:29:52,981 --> 00:29:55,402
it will take you three to six years.

298
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:58,588
It's up to you.

299
00:29:59,865 --> 00:30:02,201
Are you willing to attend hearings?

300
00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:08,081
You probably...

301
00:30:09,093 --> 00:30:10,250
know her dad--

302
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:14,855
a senator.

303
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,325
Her husband,

304
00:30:17,069 --> 00:30:18,383
a congressman.

305
00:30:20,743 --> 00:30:22,763
I know you know who my friend is.

306
00:30:24,703 --> 00:30:25,907
And I know...

307
00:30:26,721 --> 00:30:28,602
that you're just after her money.

308
00:30:30,417 --> 00:30:31,418
How much do you want?

309
00:30:34,205 --> 00:30:35,359
One hundred thousand pesos.

310
00:30:39,673 --> 00:30:41,298
It's not a big deal for them.

311
00:30:42,392 --> 00:30:44,384
But that doesn't mean that
I'll let you have it.

312
00:30:45,021 --> 00:30:46,261
Twenty thousand pesos.

313
00:30:49,346 --> 00:30:50,822
Fuck this life!

314
00:30:50,948 --> 00:30:53,769
She almost killed me
and all I'll be getting is this?!

315
00:30:53,862 --> 00:30:54,811
Ninety thousand pesos.

316
00:30:55,225 --> 00:30:56,521
Non-negotiable.

317
00:30:57,604 --> 00:30:58,815
Thirty thousand pesos.

318
00:30:59,355 --> 00:31:02,094
Plus, your safety is assured.

319
00:31:02,888 --> 00:31:05,489
You never know what will
happen once you step out.

320
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,273
Forty thousand pesos. Last price.

321
00:31:14,727 --> 00:31:15,665
Deal.

322
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,051
Tell me.

323
00:31:43,829 --> 00:31:45,429
Have you seen this, sir?

324
00:32:00,061 --> 00:32:02,271
Did I pay  an escort for sex?

325
00:32:02,527 --> 00:32:05,841
Yes! So what?  It's my money!

326
00:32:06,053 --> 00:32:10,470
Do you think only my husband
can pay a whore for sex?

327
00:32:36,207 --> 00:32:37,333
Agatha?

328
00:32:38,909 --> 00:32:39,910
July...

329
00:32:43,607 --> 00:32:45,192
Take me away from here.

330
00:32:45,436 --> 00:32:47,674
Just relax. I'll take care of you.

331
00:32:47,762 --> 00:32:48,800
Get in my car.

332
00:32:49,511 --> 00:32:50,302
Come on.

333
00:33:00,193 --> 00:33:02,404
ARABELLA IS ALREADY IN THE SAFEHOUSE.

334
00:33:02,404 --> 00:33:04,239
I LEFT HER WITH AGENT BACOLOD
AND AGENT WANDA.

335
00:33:04,406 --> 00:33:08,287
CALL ME WHEN YOU READ THIS.

336
00:33:13,747 --> 00:33:14,622
There.

337
00:33:19,685 --> 00:33:20,561
Hello.

338
00:33:20,746 --> 00:33:21,872
Good morning.

339
00:33:22,482 --> 00:33:23,418
Any updates?

340
00:33:24,383 --> 00:33:26,988
Do you remember the necklace?

341
00:33:27,769 --> 00:33:28,615
Yes.

342
00:33:29,163 --> 00:33:30,247
What's up with it?

343
00:33:30,868 --> 00:33:32,928
Was it burried with Em?

344
00:33:33,688 --> 00:33:37,307
Her body was cremated
so maybe they had it removed.

345
00:33:38,871 --> 00:33:41,895
But Choi told me that
it was a rare brand of necklace.

346
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,310
Rare, indeed! There are only ten
of it in the world.

347
00:33:44,335 --> 00:33:45,649
It was made by an Italian.

348
00:33:46,569 --> 00:33:48,218
So you think...

349
00:33:48,555 --> 00:33:50,762
the killer took the necklace?

350
00:33:51,418 --> 00:33:52,502
Just a hunch.

351
00:33:52,527 --> 00:33:55,676
But Elaine told me
that they knew nothing about it.

352
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:58,395
They will inform us if they find it.

353
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:10,449
Hello?
Pat, are you still there?

354
00:34:11,476 --> 00:34:12,617
Hello.

355
00:34:13,194 --> 00:34:14,928
You might need to go back to the farm...

356
00:34:15,272 --> 00:34:16,346
and look for it.

357
00:34:16,951 --> 00:34:18,515
That's what we're  planning to do.

358
00:34:18,927 --> 00:34:19,724
Okay.

359
00:34:20,089 --> 00:34:23,436
Just keep me posted on any leads.

360
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:26,882
Alright.

361
00:34:30,357 --> 00:34:33,013
- I'll go ahead, Choi.
- Sure. Take care.

362
00:34:45,348 --> 00:34:46,634
It looks nice, doesn't it?

363
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:48,628
Hey, Mr. Roger.

364
00:34:48,857 --> 00:34:51,114
You scared me. Good morning.

365
00:34:51,751 --> 00:34:52,924
Champaca.

366
00:34:53,864 --> 00:34:54,740
Come again?

367
00:34:55,567 --> 00:34:58,487
That's a Champaca tree.

368
00:34:58,791 --> 00:34:59,931
Oh, I see.

369
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:03,919
I'm not really fond of trees and plants.

370
00:35:04,348 --> 00:35:06,062
They don't last long in my care.

371
00:35:07,537 --> 00:35:09,257
If you have time,

372
00:35:09,904 --> 00:35:11,943
I can teach you how to take care of them.

373
00:35:12,447 --> 00:35:14,904
Or perhaps, I can bring some
plants to your house.

374
00:35:15,024 --> 00:35:16,281
Where do you live?

375
00:35:18,205 --> 00:35:19,159
Don't bother.

376
00:35:21,061 --> 00:35:22,329
I'm not ready

377
00:35:22,785 --> 00:35:24,145
to witness another death.

378
00:35:24,971 --> 00:35:26,184
Even if it's just a plant.

379
00:35:26,513 --> 00:35:27,389
Alright.

380
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:29,044
Just let me know once you're ready.

381
00:35:51,465 --> 00:35:54,468
July has saved me countless times already.

382
00:35:54,493 --> 00:35:56,237
I trust him.

383
00:36:04,907 --> 00:36:06,731
But he's acting strange.

384
00:36:08,353 --> 00:36:13,071
He might go behind your back.

385
00:36:15,098 --> 00:36:17,050
He might choose the cash reward over you.

386
00:36:17,118 --> 00:36:18,885
He's not that type.

387
00:36:19,211 --> 00:36:20,829
And besides, he loves me.

388
00:36:21,461 --> 00:36:24,916
He won't exchange our love for money.

389
00:36:28,282 --> 00:36:30,171
People will always choose money.

390
00:36:32,341 --> 00:36:33,842
Let's kill him.

391
00:36:35,397 --> 00:36:36,845
Let's get away from here.

392
00:36:37,684 --> 00:36:39,681
We only have each other to depend on.

393
00:36:42,427 --> 00:36:44,311
You're left with no one.

394
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:54,654
Let's plan on how to dispose him.

395
00:37:14,881 --> 00:37:15,984
Who were you talking to?

396
00:37:29,348 --> 00:37:30,290
Thank you.

397
00:37:35,391 --> 00:37:37,447
What's up with the heavy breakfast?

398
00:37:38,352 --> 00:37:39,299
Yes.

399
00:37:39,809 --> 00:37:41,342
Bring some to your office.

400
00:37:41,367 --> 00:37:43,845
It's my way of saying thank you
for what you did last night.

401
00:37:44,116 --> 00:37:45,805
I always bug you with my mess.

402
00:37:46,417 --> 00:37:48,208
I'm already used to it.

403
00:37:48,524 --> 00:37:49,851
I know you so well.

404
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:05,492
Belinda,

405
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:06,993
I want to ask you something...

406
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,788
What is it?

407
00:38:10,598 --> 00:38:11,706
About--

408
00:38:13,348 --> 00:38:17,253
Em and Stephen's affair.

409
00:38:18,374 --> 00:38:20,799
Can you please stop saying bad words?

410
00:38:21,374 --> 00:38:22,375
I'm sorry.

411
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,969
I just wanted to ask...

412
00:38:26,867 --> 00:38:28,765
if you already knew about it early on.

413
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,562
No.

414
00:38:35,352 --> 00:38:36,481
What do you mean?

415
00:38:37,421 --> 00:38:38,942
Were they too secretive?

416
00:38:39,682 --> 00:38:43,680
I mean, I don't want to talk about it.

417
00:38:44,768 --> 00:38:47,367
Patricia, I love you.

418
00:38:48,558 --> 00:38:50,937
I want to answer your questions...

419
00:38:52,171 --> 00:38:53,940
but I am still in pain.

420
00:38:57,653 --> 00:39:03,032
You're always in work mode.
Stop interrogating me.

421
00:39:04,553 --> 00:39:05,552
I'm sorry.

422
00:39:14,709 --> 00:39:16,755
You're phone is always ringing.

423
00:39:17,318 --> 00:39:18,757
Do you even sleep?

424
00:39:19,495 --> 00:39:21,776
It's part of the job.
I need to be alert 24/7.

425
00:39:22,169 --> 00:39:23,170
Excuse me.

426
00:39:29,393 --> 00:39:30,268
What's up, Choi?

427
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:31,635
Any updates?

428
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:34,873
I called to inform you that I already
found the source of the sex scandal.

429
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,332
Where can I find it?

430
00:39:38,234 --> 00:39:39,611
It's in a...

431
00:39:40,241 --> 00:39:42,150
Computer shop in downtown Manila.

432
00:39:42,175 --> 00:39:43,673
You can get there in an hour.

433
00:39:43,902 --> 00:39:45,216
Where is Armand?

434
00:39:45,498 --> 00:39:47,427
He's in the farm, looking for the necklace.

435
00:39:47,866 --> 00:39:49,053
I forgot.

436
00:39:49,732 --> 00:39:51,514
Alright. I'll go by myself.

437
00:39:51,539 --> 00:39:53,975
Okay. Hang on, I'll send you the address.

438
00:39:54,147 --> 00:39:55,418
Okay.

439
00:39:58,939 --> 00:40:00,840
I'm sorry. I have to go.

440
00:40:01,561 --> 00:40:02,723
Something came up.

441
00:40:02,748 --> 00:40:06,058
Choi has already traced
the mastermind behind Em's sex scandal.

442
00:40:06,083 --> 00:40:07,222
I'll go there now.

443
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:09,407
Okay.

444
00:40:11,841 --> 00:40:12,727
Bye.

445
00:40:40,542 --> 00:40:42,257
That’s enough. Let’s go!

446
00:41:08,945 --> 00:41:09,780
Freeze!

447
00:41:09,805 --> 00:41:10,661
Shit!

448
00:41:12,892 --> 00:41:15,874
Once I get out of here,
I will hunt you down!

449
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:20,707
Are you going to kill me?

450
00:41:21,155 --> 00:41:22,448
Watch out!

451
00:41:23,038 --> 00:41:24,309
It should've just been me.

452
00:41:24,334 --> 00:41:28,407
Why do I always lose the ones
who are dear to me?

453
00:41:31,468 --> 00:41:35,326
We only have each other to depend on.
Let's plan on how to kill him.
