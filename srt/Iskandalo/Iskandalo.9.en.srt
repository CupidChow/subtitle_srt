1
00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:06,673
To Em's detractors,
I'm telling you,

2
00:00:06,698 --> 00:00:08,867
you're messing with
the wrong person.

3
00:00:08,892 --> 00:00:10,960
I want to answer
all your questions

4
00:00:10,985 --> 00:00:12,512
but I am still in pain.

5
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:14,531
You are under arrest
for sexual harassment

6
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:16,074
and for the rape
of Angel Manaclang

7
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:17,350
It looks good, doesn't it?

8
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,536
Let's end this.
Don't make this hard for you.

9
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:22,500
I'm sure you know
who her father is.

10
00:01:04,346 --> 00:01:06,232
Tea time, guys!

11
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:13,423
I'm sure you've heard about
Em Celera's sex scandal.

12
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:16,259
- The infuencer, Em Celera.
- I was actually shocked.

13
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:19,579
I didn't think Em could do that.

14
00:01:29,178 --> 00:01:33,359
- Those who keep on sharing the video--
- What the fuck is this?

15
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,762
Em is a girl.
She's a woman.

16
00:01:37,906 --> 00:01:40,700
- Oh my god!
- This is terrible.

17
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,853
- This is intense!
- I don't like her anymore.

18
00:01:43,878 --> 00:01:45,627
This is so embarrassing!

19
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,673
You know what,
I'm sure my mom...

20
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,594
wants to find out
who I was with in the sex scandal.

21
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,017
You can't tell her.

22
00:02:24,516 --> 00:02:25,582
But why?

23
00:02:26,962 --> 00:02:28,106
She's my mom.

24
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,193
I know,

25
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,196
but I just don't want it
to blow up.

26
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,449
Don't you trust her?

27
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,957
Don't worry.
I don't have plans...

28
00:02:45,982 --> 00:02:47,525
of revealing who the guy was

29
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,003
no matter how much
they force me to.

30
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,594
Let me handle this online.

31
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:01,723
But you know what,

32
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:06,436
a lot of reporters
have been pestering us.

33
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,063
Some of them are real

34
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,733
while some are just
in it for the scoop.

35
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,777
They just want
something to talk about.

36
00:03:17,224 --> 00:03:18,882
But I don't have plans
on telling them

37
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,491
who the guy was.

38
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,952
They just want to know...

39
00:03:23,617 --> 00:03:25,619
who you really are.

40
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,377
Just let the issue die.

41
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:34,923
That's the best thing to do.

42
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,468
People are buying it
because it's hot news.

43
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:42,722
For sure, they'll forget
about it after a week.

44
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,686
Don't worry about it.

45
00:03:46,086 --> 00:03:47,810
I'm already talking
to a PR team...

46
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,022
that can help you...

47
00:03:51,207 --> 00:03:52,313
get away with it.

48
00:03:52,805 --> 00:03:53,827
Okay?

49
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,407
Who do you think
uploaded the video?

50
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,123
That person
was clearly after me.

51
00:04:10,063 --> 00:04:11,935
If that was your
political nemesis,

52
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,128
I'm sure he wouldn't
blur your face.

53
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:19,133
I think I have an idea
on who did it.

54
00:04:21,304 --> 00:04:22,446
Who did it?

55
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,015
What are you doing here?

56
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,601
Relax.

57
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,968
I'm just checking on
my son-in-law.

58
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,028
Son-in-law?

59
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,340
But I heard on
the news that...

60
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,991
you already have
a new son-in-law.

61
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,911
I didn't know your
daughter is now into escorts.

62
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,539
It's quite obvious.

63
00:06:55,147 --> 00:06:59,384
I can tell her type of guy
just by looking at you.

64
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,464
What brings you here?

65
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:06,592
Are you going
to kill me?

66
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:09,929
Are you doing it yourself?

67
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,434
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

68
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:17,728
Enough with your shit.

69
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:21,649
We both know
you're a monster.

70
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,276
But the bad news is...

71
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,612
your minions are failures?

72
00:07:27,824 --> 00:07:28,873
Failures?

73
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,617
Maybe they were...

74
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,828
just warning you.

75
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,544
Do what you want.
I don't care.

76
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,506
But I'm telling you,

77
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,093
we'll die together.

78
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,680
Step on me
again and...

79
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,057
It'll surely explode
like a bomb.

80
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,060
Perhaps it's true.

81
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:02,482
People become poets
when they are about to die.

82
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,697
Ouch!

83
00:08:10,592 --> 00:08:13,436
Ouch!

84
00:08:13,866 --> 00:08:15,536
You son of a bitch!

85
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,317
Nurse! Emergency!

86
00:08:21,342 --> 00:08:23,753
The patient is bleeding.

87
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,288
The patient is dying.

88
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,599
Fuck you!

89
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,038
Freeze!

90
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,342
Stop!

91
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:04,437
Hey!

92
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,270
Shit!

93
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:43,786
Go on!
Try to run away!

94
00:10:49,001 --> 00:10:50,583
Did you kill Em?

95
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,778
No, I didn't kill Em!

96
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:59,200
We just share sex scandals.

97
00:10:59,507 --> 00:11:01,243
I'm just a member
of a facebook group.

98
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,497
We just share
porn videos.

99
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,416
Then one day,
someone asked me...

100
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,461
to share Em's sex scandal.

101
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,962
I was told that
I would get paid.

102
00:11:12,454 --> 00:11:14,922
Of course, I said yes!
That was easy money.

103
00:11:14,947 --> 00:11:18,492
- Who gave you a copy?
- It’s an anonymous account, ma’am!

104
00:11:18,517 --> 00:11:23,441
I was just receiving
emails from bot accounts.

105
00:11:23,466 --> 00:11:26,686
You may check my phone
if you want.

106
00:11:27,434 --> 00:11:34,877
I was also receiving payment notifications
from different mobile numbers.

107
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:38,322
They were using
disposable sim cards.

108
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,992
I think those were
pre-paid numbers.

109
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:48,874
If you try to reply, it will say,
"Failed to send message."

110
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:58,050
Make sure you're not fooling me

111
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,595
or else, you're dead.

112
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,521
Ma'am, please let me go.

113
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,607
Ma'am! I didn't do anything wrong!

114
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,402
Ma'am! Let me go!

115
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,447
Ma'am! Ma'am!

116
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:27,621
What did he say?

117
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:32,293
He said the sender
was using untraceable emails.

118
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,170
Can you trace it?

119
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,590
Fuck!

120
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:41,677
Shit.

121
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,012
Relax.

122
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,641
It's okay.

123
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,084
You did your best.

124
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,689
Choi,

125
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,776
I can't rely on you
if you're stressed.

126
00:12:57,578 --> 00:12:59,788
You can rest first
if you want.

127
00:13:01,575 --> 00:13:03,138
At least for today.

128
00:13:04,232 --> 00:13:07,328
Or let's just eat
if you want.

129
00:13:07,569 --> 00:13:09,946
Maybe all you need
is good food.

130
00:13:10,938 --> 00:13:11,973
Fine. Let's go.

131
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:17,338
Maybe I just need fresh air.
I feel suffocated in this office.

132
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,568
This is bullshit!

133
00:13:28,987 --> 00:13:30,000
It's hot.

134
00:13:31,047 --> 00:13:32,353
It tastes better
when it's hot.

135
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,524
It's hot!

136
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,992
Whenever I'm having
a bad day

137
00:13:41,258 --> 00:13:45,597
or when things just
don't go as planned,

138
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:49,203
I do simple things
that make me happy.

139
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,455
And this food
is one of them?

140
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,752
- Simple, indeed.
- I do it to check...

141
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,630
if I am still the person

142
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,008
who feels happiness
in a simple bowl of beef stew.

143
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:04,802
It makes me...

144
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,554
feel grounded.

145
00:14:08,261 --> 00:14:14,270
Sometimes, we tend to forget
who we really are.

146
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,188
Me,

147
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,400
I feel happy
whenever someone...

148
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,902
is listening to
what I have to say.

149
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,489
Maybe that's the reason
I became a troll.

150
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,950
I annoy people.
I bash them

151
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,451
because they pay attention...

152
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,329
to my rants.

153
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:36,500
My classmates said
I was a famewhore.

154
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,752
I think that's why
I shut down.

155
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,796
I focused on....

156
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,383
computers.
It damaged my eyesight.

157
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,510
I joined online communities...

158
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,096
and tipped-off PBI agents.

159
00:14:49,831 --> 00:14:50,938
But you know what,

160
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,225
you're good at what you do.

161
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,273
Don't judge me,
I'm about to say something corny.

162
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:05,946
I'm happy that you
listen to what I say.

163
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:10,868
It feels like you
really are my friend.

164
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,754
- Just a sec.
- Go ahead.

165
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:21,921
Hello.

166
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,383
I'm here at the office.
Where are you?

167
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,983
We're just eating out.
We'll be back in a few.

168
00:15:30,201 --> 00:15:32,306
Are you sure
you're not dating?

169
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:33,682
Stop it.

170
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:37,389
Don't be silly. Do you have
updates on the necklace?

171
00:15:37,414 --> 00:15:39,355
I couldn't find it.

172
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,874
It wasn't in the farm

173
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,359
nor in the condo.

174
00:15:43,384 --> 00:15:45,650
Even Elaine and Joel
have no idea where it is.

175
00:15:45,675 --> 00:15:48,303
Why do we always
have roadblocks?

176
00:15:48,841 --> 00:15:51,967
Patricia, this might be
more than a roadblock.

177
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,494
This looks like a dead end.

178
00:15:53,892 --> 00:15:57,854
Stop attracting bad vibes!
Let's just talk later.

179
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,689
This tastes good.

180
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:06,966
Right, bro.

181
00:16:06,991 --> 00:16:08,834
- Hey!
- Hey!

182
00:16:08,975 --> 00:16:10,427
Is this your treat?

183
00:16:10,498 --> 00:16:13,973
- But I already paid our bill.
- I didn't say anything.

184
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,819
But you said
it's her treat!

185
00:16:16,967 --> 00:16:18,085
Watch out!

186
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,990
You called me up.
I'm Choi.

187
00:17:13,015 --> 00:17:14,308
I'm Patricia.

188
00:17:14,745 --> 00:17:15,849
Choi.

189
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:23,642
First of all,
I am serious

190
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,003
because I wanted to help
and you called me up.

191
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,935
I'm happy...

192
00:17:42,411 --> 00:17:44,329
that you listen to what I say.

193
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,607
It feels like you
really are my friend.

194
00:17:47,418 --> 00:17:49,011
Choi!

195
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,389
Pat, how are you?

196
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,433
Choi is right in front of me.

197
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:30,067
I can't believe
that he's gone.

198
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,239
Don't go anywhere.
I'll pick you up.

199
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,286
Don't bother.

200
00:18:42,323 --> 00:18:43,819
Patricia, I know you're strong,

201
00:18:43,844 --> 00:18:45,530
but you're not okay right now.

202
00:18:46,724 --> 00:18:48,147
Wait for me.

203
00:19:47,891 --> 00:19:50,310
Have you talked
to Choi's family?

204
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,237
Don't worry,
I will talk to them.

205
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:01,300
Why did it have
to be Choi?

206
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,995
It should've just been me.

207
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:10,834
It's me they want.

208
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:19,468
Sometimes I feel like
I have been cursed.

209
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:26,058
Because everything I value

210
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,854
disappears.

211
00:20:37,722 --> 00:20:39,463
Don't look at it that way.

212
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:43,158
Choi knew what
he got himself into.

213
00:20:43,183 --> 00:20:47,846
And besides,
he knew that we might--

214
00:20:48,229 --> 00:20:49,592
Get killed?

215
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,170
We are all useless.

216
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,298
We couldn't do anything.

217
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:09,076
Just relax. Let's just find out
who did this to Choi.

218
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:14,002
Maybe somebody
wanted to get back at him.

219
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:15,594
Get back at him?

220
00:21:17,518 --> 00:21:18,724
Or at us?

221
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:22,385
What do you mean?

222
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,088
The killer is aware that...

223
00:21:30,635 --> 00:21:33,908
we'd lose this battle
if we lose Choi.

224
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,854
The killer knows how vital
Choi is to our team.

225
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,732
Fuck. I don't want
to see that woman.

226
00:21:46,757 --> 00:21:47,675
Bring me back inside.

227
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,057
Go on and talk to her....

228
00:21:49,082 --> 00:21:50,542
so we can get
this done and over with.

229
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:07,701
Bold of you to show your
face to me, you animal.

230
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,962
Choi is dead.

231
00:22:12,368 --> 00:22:14,041
What do I care?

232
00:22:14,658 --> 00:22:17,578
I just want to see you in person

233
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:20,422
to make sure that
you're stuck here

234
00:22:21,557 --> 00:22:24,276
and you don't have anything
to do with what happened.

235
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,762
You're crazy.

236
00:22:27,727 --> 00:22:28,697
First, you set me up.

237
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:31,516
And now you're blaming me
for what happened to Choi?

238
00:22:31,876 --> 00:22:34,394
Even if I am already in jail?

239
00:22:35,194 --> 00:22:36,362
Don't worry.

240
00:22:36,626 --> 00:22:40,423
Once I get out of here,
I will hunt you down!

241
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:43,710
You ruined my life!

242
00:22:45,014 --> 00:22:47,683
Don’t be surprised
when I ruin yours!

243
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:50,519
That's what
I will do to you, Patricia.

244
00:22:50,544 --> 00:22:52,149
Remember that!

245
00:22:53,684 --> 00:22:56,145
Don't ever show me
that woman again.

246
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,290
Come over here.

247
00:23:45,449 --> 00:23:47,019
Shit.

248
00:23:47,879 --> 00:23:48,879
Wow.

249
00:23:49,411 --> 00:23:51,191
You feel so good.

250
00:24:03,174 --> 00:24:04,493
Shit.

251
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,731
Shit.

252
00:24:25,474 --> 00:24:27,153
Damn.

253
00:24:40,247 --> 00:24:43,857
Fuck you.
Are you going to kill me?

254
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,032
Oh, shit!

255
00:24:58,189 --> 00:25:00,801
Oh, shit!

256
00:25:05,325 --> 00:25:06,379
Damn.

257
00:25:22,533 --> 00:25:24,118
My condolences.

258
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,823
I'm sorry.

259
00:25:28,972 --> 00:25:32,489
I don't know how
I can make it up to your family.

260
00:25:35,542 --> 00:25:39,663
But I'm really sorry.
This is all my fault.

261
00:25:42,204 --> 00:25:44,165
I was the one
who recruited Choi.

262
00:25:45,848 --> 00:25:47,641
Not realizing that....

263
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,924
he'd get killed.

264
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,927
You know what, ma'am,

265
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:59,956
We lost our parents
at an early age.

266
00:26:01,528 --> 00:26:06,199
When he is interested
in something,

267
00:26:08,209 --> 00:26:10,652
he devotes his
whole time for it.

268
00:26:12,012 --> 00:26:18,102
He wants all his
questions answered.

269
00:26:20,255 --> 00:26:23,138
That's how he was
when Em died.

270
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,196
That's why when
you recruited him,

271
00:26:30,927 --> 00:26:32,577
he was so happy.

272
00:26:37,081 --> 00:26:39,792
He was so proud
of your team.

273
00:26:42,321 --> 00:26:43,781
That's why ma'am,

274
00:26:45,652 --> 00:26:48,405
please don't blame yourself.

275
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:52,319
But he didn't deserve
to die that way.

276
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:56,031
He didn't.

277
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:00,055
Maybe...

278
00:27:01,812 --> 00:27:04,899
the only thing that
could make Choi happy

279
00:27:05,819 --> 00:27:07,904
is for you to finish
what you started.

280
00:27:08,936 --> 00:27:11,147
To answer
all his questions.

281
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,009
Give justice to Em.

282
00:27:17,688 --> 00:27:19,231
That way,

283
00:27:21,285 --> 00:27:23,996
you'll be able to
give justice to Choi.

284
00:27:38,856 --> 00:27:41,060
I'll go ahead, ma'am.

285
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:43,810
Thank you.

286
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,090
Hello, Armand?

287
00:28:06,115 --> 00:28:07,157
Where are you?

288
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:11,460
I'm here at Choi's burial.

289
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:15,235
We received an update on
Agatha's whereabouts.

290
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,720
Just go to the location.

291
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:20,951
Okay, I'm on my way.

292
00:28:34,376 --> 00:28:36,346
Why are you dressed up?
Where are you going?

293
00:28:49,289 --> 00:28:50,314
Agatha...

294
00:28:52,161 --> 00:28:53,704
I need to do this

295
00:28:56,462 --> 00:28:58,900
because you're not
safe with me.

296
00:29:01,283 --> 00:29:02,826
It's not safe for
you outside.

297
00:29:03,924 --> 00:29:05,744
You're not safe
from yourself.

298
00:29:12,033 --> 00:29:13,075
What's wrong with you?

299
00:29:14,995 --> 00:29:16,288
I'm begging you.

300
00:29:16,678 --> 00:29:17,847
We have a lawyer.

301
00:29:19,836 --> 00:29:21,504
I'll help you, Agatha.

302
00:29:24,379 --> 00:29:25,631
Just surrender.

303
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:28,683
Please.

304
00:30:05,365 --> 00:30:07,075
Come on!
Let's have a drink!

305
00:30:08,423 --> 00:30:10,617
Fine. I'll surrender.

306
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:13,432
Let's talk about it here.

307
00:30:29,197 --> 00:30:31,292
Cheers to my defeat!

308
00:30:31,317 --> 00:30:32,651
To your defeat.

309
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,561
Fuck you!

310
00:30:55,384 --> 00:30:56,552
Shit!

311
00:30:57,237 --> 00:30:58,739
Motherfucker!

312
00:31:19,455 --> 00:31:20,873
He deserves it.

313
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:23,394
Yes, he does.

314
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,414
- Enjoy, sir.
- Sir, this is urgent.

315
00:31:56,675 --> 00:31:58,844
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but did you already have a number?

316
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:01,708
Sir, I am an investigator.

317
00:32:03,392 --> 00:32:04,520
Hang on, ma'am.

318
00:32:32,091 --> 00:32:33,551
Freeze!

319
00:32:36,013 --> 00:32:37,481
Stop!

320
00:32:45,979 --> 00:32:47,377
Stop!

321
00:33:01,666 --> 00:33:04,649
After all those sleepless
and draining weeks,

322
00:33:04,674 --> 00:33:06,759
the efforts of the team
that is handling...

323
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:09,768
Em Celera's case
have finally paid off.

324
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:15,385
Yesterday, the team led
by Agent Esguerra...

325
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,121
traced and caught
our primary suspect.

326
00:33:18,527 --> 00:33:20,070
She was an obssessed fan

327
00:33:20,227 --> 00:33:23,104
and is suffering from
mental health conditions as well.

328
00:33:24,989 --> 00:33:26,282
What are you going to do?

329
00:33:26,307 --> 00:33:28,877
I'll check your
blood type, ma'am.

330
00:33:28,902 --> 00:33:31,526
You'll undergo
a blood transfusion later.

331
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:49,027
What information can you
get from that woman?

332
00:33:49,526 --> 00:33:50,744
I don't know.

333
00:33:52,149 --> 00:33:55,823
But people should
stay away from her.

334
00:33:56,421 --> 00:33:58,674
That woman is crazy.

335
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,669
You're excited to
interrogate her, aren't you?

336
00:34:09,301 --> 00:34:12,054
Nothing excites
me anymore.

337
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,152
I just want this case to end.

338
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:45,229
We caught her and
brought her to the hospital.

339
00:34:46,362 --> 00:34:47,822
But she killed herself.

340
00:34:48,135 --> 00:34:50,605
But how can we be sure
that she killed Em

341
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,840
if we didn't even hear her side

342
00:34:52,887 --> 00:34:54,054
because she's dead?

343
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,435
The only thing
we can share with you...

344
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:01,604
is the evidence that
we have gathered.

345
00:35:02,608 --> 00:35:04,193
All of which point to her.

346
00:35:06,217 --> 00:35:08,886
We dedicated
our lives to this case.

347
00:35:11,604 --> 00:35:15,775
We lost a team member.

348
00:35:34,346 --> 00:35:38,261
I want Em's killer
to rot in jail.

349
00:35:41,354 --> 00:35:46,901
But why can't we seem
to get the justice that we want?

350
00:35:46,926 --> 00:35:49,161
What is wrong, Joel?

351
00:35:50,184 --> 00:35:51,435
Let them be.

352
00:35:53,073 --> 00:35:55,200
Let them burn in hell.

353
00:35:57,009 --> 00:35:58,360
The good thing is...

354
00:35:59,364 --> 00:36:01,158
you are now at peace.

355
00:36:02,149 --> 00:36:06,111
Em's killer has been caught.
We can now start a new life.

356
00:36:23,918 --> 00:36:24,963
Patricia...

357
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,912
What do you want?

358
00:36:33,771 --> 00:36:36,565
Nothing. I just
want to thank you.

359
00:36:37,392 --> 00:36:40,187
Justice has finally been
served to Em.

360
00:36:41,561 --> 00:36:44,355
She can finally
rest in peace.

361
00:36:44,872 --> 00:36:47,958
I don't have time
for flattery, Stephen.

362
00:36:50,014 --> 00:36:51,057
Patricia,

363
00:36:51,938 --> 00:36:55,734
can we talk outside?
I won't take much of your time.

364
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,648
Tell me, Stephen.

365
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:17,453
I know you already
closed the case

366
00:37:18,376 --> 00:37:21,588
because you and Belinda
are best friends.

367
00:37:24,564 --> 00:37:27,233
Be careful with that clan
especially with Pio.

368
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:29,872
Belinda is my childhood
best friend.

369
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,791
You're just bitter....

370
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:34,736
because she was able
to move on from you.

371
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:37,546
Maybe.

372
00:37:38,983 --> 00:37:41,080
But you're too complacent, Patricia.

373
00:37:42,989 --> 00:37:45,867
One thing's for sure,
they will clean up that messy case

374
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,975
and they will have you
do it for them,

375
00:37:49,158 --> 00:37:50,184
right?

376
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,355
You're the one who dragged
them into this.

377
00:37:54,534 --> 00:37:56,870
If there is any trash that
should be cleaned up,

378
00:37:57,447 --> 00:37:58,569
that's you.

379
00:38:02,205 --> 00:38:03,281
Anyway,

380
00:38:04,047 --> 00:38:06,557
do you have updates
on who uploaded the video?

381
00:38:07,691 --> 00:38:08,775
You know what, Stephen,

382
00:38:09,074 --> 00:38:10,284
I don't have time...

383
00:38:11,402 --> 00:38:14,362
for your baseless leads.

384
00:38:14,901 --> 00:38:17,662
I know you've heard that
they tried to kill me.

385
00:38:18,063 --> 00:38:19,398
Because....

386
00:38:20,336 --> 00:38:21,545
you had an affair?

387
00:38:22,845 --> 00:38:25,389
Or because you
fooled my best friend?

388
00:38:27,092 --> 00:38:28,469
Those are not the same, Stephen.

389
00:38:29,455 --> 00:38:31,939
And if they wanted
to kill you,

390
00:38:32,377 --> 00:38:34,546
why didn't you
tell the police?

391
00:38:35,994 --> 00:38:39,010
I should feel sorry
for you Stephen, and yet...

392
00:38:39,307 --> 00:38:44,405
I’m not even sure
if you deserve that much.

393
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:46,878
Well,

394
00:38:48,388 --> 00:38:49,639
don't blame me.

395
00:38:50,856 --> 00:38:52,441
And don't tell me that
I didn't warn you.

396
00:38:54,579 --> 00:38:55,747
Bye for now.

397
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,017
Hey!

398
00:39:08,129 --> 00:39:10,048
You're not even drunk yet
but you're already spacing out.

399
00:39:10,543 --> 00:39:11,963
I'm just thinking of something.

400
00:39:12,662 --> 00:39:14,038
I feel like there's
something wrong.

401
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,411
What is it this time?

402
00:39:18,728 --> 00:39:23,549
We know that
Agatha killed Trent.

403
00:39:23,926 --> 00:39:26,127
But we're not sure
if she really killed Em.

404
00:39:26,945 --> 00:39:30,657
What do you want?
To retract our pronouncement?

405
00:39:30,682 --> 00:39:33,018
Your reputation and
the agency's are on the line.

406
00:39:33,963 --> 00:39:39,794
Don’t get too
attached to the case.

407
00:39:39,819 --> 00:39:41,362
Let's move on.

408
00:39:41,885 --> 00:39:42,922
Look at me.

409
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,922
I've already moved on from you.

410
00:39:45,995 --> 00:39:47,121
Look at this.

411
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:49,410
- Yes, look at it.
- Who is that?

412
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:50,679
She's tall.

413
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,501
Her hair is long.

414
00:39:52,826 --> 00:39:53,912
She is brown-skinned

415
00:39:54,305 --> 00:39:55,556
and has a pointed nose.

416
00:39:56,404 --> 00:39:59,053
But I'm still looking for someone
who has the same mole as yours.

417
00:39:59,581 --> 00:40:03,043
My point is,
you should move on.

418
00:40:07,782 --> 00:40:08,699
Hold on.

419
00:40:11,433 --> 00:40:16,201
MA'AM, I NEED YOUR HELP. ASAP.

420
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,083
Shit.

421
00:40:21,427 --> 00:40:22,752
Hello?

422
00:40:22,889 --> 00:40:24,213
I'm on my way.

423
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:26,241
What happened?

424
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:30,695
She got drunk and drove alone.

425
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,221
She said she would
just go on a roadtrip.

426
00:40:32,246 --> 00:40:34,811
I tried to stop her
but she pushed me away.

427
00:40:34,836 --> 00:40:35,879
Where did she go?

428
00:40:36,296 --> 00:40:39,704
I don't know, ma'am.
I'm afraid that she might

429
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:40,951
get into an accident.

430
00:40:40,976 --> 00:40:44,045
She’s been talking
about killing herself.

431
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:47,428
Alright. I'll look for her.
Thank you.

432
00:40:47,453 --> 00:40:48,818
Thank you, ma'am.

433
00:40:54,538 --> 00:40:55,539
Hello?

434
00:40:55,914 --> 00:40:57,165
Belinda,

435
00:40:57,794 --> 00:40:59,411
where are you?

436
00:40:59,436 --> 00:41:00,854
I'm just at home.

437
00:41:01,128 --> 00:41:04,214
Don't lie to me.
Where are you?

438
00:41:05,085 --> 00:41:06,990
Did our maid inform you?

439
00:41:07,662 --> 00:41:09,238
That fucker.

440
00:41:09,263 --> 00:41:11,584
Belinda, are you driving?

441
00:41:12,073 --> 00:41:14,324
Stop driving.
I'll pick you up.

442
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:16,810
I'm on a roadtrip.

443
00:41:16,835 --> 00:41:18,795
Fix yourself, Belinda!

444
00:41:19,476 --> 00:41:21,545
But there's nothing to fix.

445
00:41:21,765 --> 00:41:23,350
Belinda, you're drunk!

446
00:41:23,667 --> 00:41:25,811
So what if I am drunk?

447
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:29,654
Just stay where you are
and wait for me.

448
00:41:47,498 --> 00:41:49,250
Belinda, what's wrong with you?

449
00:41:50,552 --> 00:41:52,122
I want to die.

450
00:41:54,973 --> 00:41:56,433
I texted him.

451
00:41:57,144 --> 00:41:58,854
I couldn't help it.

452
00:42:00,994 --> 00:42:02,428
I told him that...

453
00:42:02,732 --> 00:42:06,088
if he apologizes,
I will take him back.

454
00:42:06,113 --> 00:42:08,029
We will start anew.

455
00:42:09,738 --> 00:42:10,906
No, Belinda.

456
00:42:11,684 --> 00:42:14,228
But he told me....

457
00:42:15,881 --> 00:42:17,466
that I am a loser.

458
00:42:21,902 --> 00:42:24,697
And that
he never loved me.

459
00:42:28,357 --> 00:42:29,821
Stop crying, Belinda.

460
00:42:31,717 --> 00:42:33,136
Let me take you home.

461
00:42:39,029 --> 00:42:40,435
That's enough.

462
00:42:58,207 --> 00:43:01,878
Belinda, let's go.
You should take a shower first.

463
00:43:03,785 --> 00:43:05,120
I'll just get your towel.

464
00:43:32,352 --> 00:43:34,740
Em said that
they were just friends.

465
00:43:34,765 --> 00:43:36,633
Until I saw her post online.

466
00:43:36,658 --> 00:43:38,678
She was wearing a necklace
with a half heart pendant.

467
00:43:39,115 --> 00:43:41,830
She said she was looking
for the other half of it.

468
00:43:42,045 --> 00:43:43,748
But Choi told me that
it was a rare brand of necklace.

469
00:43:43,773 --> 00:43:46,251
Rare, indeed!
There are only ten of it in the world.

470
00:43:46,276 --> 00:43:47,653
It was made by an Italian.

471
00:43:47,678 --> 00:43:51,014
Do you think the killer
took the necklace?

472
00:44:02,345 --> 00:44:04,277
Boss, we killed the boy,

473
00:44:04,302 --> 00:44:05,949
but we weren't able
to kill the woman.

474
00:44:05,974 --> 00:44:07,434
But don't worry.

475
00:44:07,459 --> 00:44:10,824
I heard the boy was the one
who was doing all the work.

476
00:44:10,849 --> 00:44:16,676
Why did you kill him when it was the woman
who was so persistent with the case?!

477
00:44:17,534 --> 00:44:22,241
Good thing I honor my word,
or else you wouldn't get paid.

478
00:44:22,266 --> 00:44:26,604
Sir, I can do another round
if you want.

479
00:44:26,629 --> 00:44:28,566
But that will be
another transaction.

480
00:44:48,997 --> 00:44:51,333
If you see him,
will you remember?

481
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:53,860
It's him!
He killed my dad!

482
00:44:53,885 --> 00:44:55,837
Is it true that you're
the one behind my sex scandal?

483
00:44:55,862 --> 00:44:57,410
I have a better news for you.

484
00:44:57,435 --> 00:44:58,840
I am pregnant.

485
00:45:02,202 --> 00:45:05,288
If you'd get reincarnated,
what animal would you like to be?

486
00:45:05,313 --> 00:45:06,139
A cat.

487
00:45:06,164 --> 00:45:07,874
I'm tired of being a lapdog.

488
00:45:07,899 --> 00:45:11,670
I thought that the people
I was loyal to were also loyal to me.

489
00:45:11,695 --> 00:45:14,665
But I was wrong.

490
00:45:15,206 --> 00:45:16,687
Patricia...
