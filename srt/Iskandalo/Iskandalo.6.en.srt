1
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:05,046
I'm not satisfied with Agatha.

2
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:06,715
Do you really think she can carry Em?

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,675
She might have an accomplice.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,177
Backer of drug syndicates.

5
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:12,028
So I checked each one
and it has over a hundred likes,

6
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:13,054
but I found nothing suspicious.

7
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:15,098
None of the likers have that tattoo.

8
00:00:15,123 --> 00:00:18,018
I placed their social media
posts side by side.

9
00:00:18,043 --> 00:00:19,086
He was in Vietnam!

10
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:21,772
Are you aware that
your husband had a mistress?

11
00:00:22,242 --> 00:00:23,915
- What are you doing here?!
- Ma'am!

12
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,692
- How dare you come here!
- I'm just here to pay my respects.

13
00:00:25,717 --> 00:00:27,903
Leave! This is all your fault!

14
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:31,490
You'll also help me
when I'm in need, right?

15
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:54,070
Hello, everyone! It's me again
and again! It's your bubbly Em!

16
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:57,348
Welcome to another exciting video!

17
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,853
For today's video, we were given
permission to shoot inside the Congress.

18
00:01:02,127 --> 00:01:04,898
This is everyone's most requested video:

19
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,067
Car wash!

20
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,786
Hi, Em-nation!

21
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:20,388
I am Bimby!

22
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,207
We'll be doing a mukbang

23
00:01:22,232 --> 00:01:25,502
and I'll be asking Em
some facts about her.

24
00:01:25,712 --> 00:01:26,878
Cheers!

25
00:01:26,948 --> 00:01:28,505
What is your full name?

26
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,591
My full name is Em Celera.
Quite long, isn't it?

27
00:01:31,688 --> 00:01:33,176
How tall are you?

28
00:01:33,321 --> 00:01:34,386
I'm 5'7.

29
00:01:34,842 --> 00:01:36,388
Name three things you love.

30
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:37,598
Eating.

31
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:38,724
Sleeping.

32
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,100
Then repeat.

33
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:41,893
That's the third one.

34
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:45,522
This is for you, Em-nation.
We'll be playing chubby bunny.

35
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,781
Chubby bunny!

36
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:58,993
Next question, and I think
you want to ask her this:

37
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:00,871
What is your zodiac sign?

38
00:02:01,396 --> 00:02:02,497
I'm a Virgo.

39
00:02:02,794 --> 00:02:04,374
How are you feeling right now?

40
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,708
I'm feeling blessed.

41
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,252
Wow.

42
00:02:07,277 --> 00:02:09,087
- You know it, girl!
- Of course!

43
00:02:09,112 --> 00:02:12,090
What is your favorite movie or movies?

44
00:02:12,462 --> 00:02:13,967
HUGAS.

45
00:02:14,726 --> 00:02:15,636
Okay.

46
00:02:23,724 --> 00:02:24,728
Good job!

47
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:29,649
This one is something:
Who's your celebrity crush or crushes?

48
00:02:29,674 --> 00:02:31,360
- Do you have any?
- A celebrity crush?

49
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,989
- Next question, please.
- Okay.

50
00:02:36,335 --> 00:02:37,544
Can you cook?

51
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:39,004
Of course.
I know how to cook.

52
00:02:39,029 --> 00:02:42,512
Okay. What dishes can you cook?

53
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:46,458
- I can cook Sinigang and Pinakbet.
- Those are delicious. Local delicacies.

54
00:02:46,483 --> 00:02:48,293
I can also cook pasta.

55
00:02:48,438 --> 00:02:50,712
What turns you on?

56
00:02:50,891 --> 00:02:57,026
- When a person is neat.
- Oh, I see.

57
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:59,654
And that's it for today's video!

58
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:03,224
Thank you for watching
and we hope you enjoyed.

59
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:23,303
This is where
our country's laws are passed.

60
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:26,389
As you can see,
I'm in formal wear today

61
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:29,042
because sexy outfits
aren't allowed in here.

62
00:03:29,352 --> 00:03:31,603
But kidding aside,

63
00:03:32,406 --> 00:03:34,272
I need to be serious for today's video

64
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:43,390
because our guest
is a well-respected congressman.

65
00:03:43,637 --> 00:03:45,308
Our congressman.

66
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:47,144
Join me as I get to know him.

67
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,813
But before we begin,
let's look for him first.

68
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,485
Sir, may I ask for your help?

69
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,278
Yes.

70
00:03:56,527 --> 00:04:00,323
Do you know where
Congressman Stephen Chuatico's office is?

71
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,702
I am Stephen Chuatico.

72
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:04,870
Wow.

73
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:08,039
I did not expect you
to be this handsome.

74
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,082
Thank you.

75
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,500
Do I look bad in photos?

76
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,986
Well... a bit.

77
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:23,054
As a representative
of Ligtas Partylist,

78
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,933
I am pushing for free legal services

79
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:30,729
for our disenfranchised countrymen.

80
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:32,622
What if

81
00:04:32,974 --> 00:04:34,775
they are innocent

82
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,028
but they can't afford a lawyer?

83
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,865
Will justice be out of reach for them?

84
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,534
That is something we want to change.

85
00:04:56,718 --> 00:04:59,939
Hello, everyone! It's me again
and again! It's your bubbly Em!

86
00:04:59,964 --> 00:05:03,217
Welcome to another exciting video!

87
00:05:03,242 --> 00:05:05,722
For today's video, we were given
permission to shoot inside the Congress.

88
00:05:05,747 --> 00:05:07,682
I was wearing a grass skirt...

89
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,726
and was dancing it all out.

90
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,688
It was for Miss Little Banocod,

91
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:14,731
the most prestigious
pageant in our province.

92
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,750
My mom didn't want me to lose.

93
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:20,529
There were four of us
who did the Tahitian dance.

94
00:05:28,606 --> 00:05:31,064
What's with that stare?

95
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,194
I just find you gorgeous.

96
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:37,838
You're flattering me.

97
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,425
I bet that's how you snagged your wife.

98
00:05:45,695 --> 00:05:47,155
You know what,

99
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,598
I have something for you.

100
00:05:50,722 --> 00:05:52,002
What is this?

101
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,738
It's beautiful!

102
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,617
May I?

103
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,018
But...

104
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,688
where's the other half?

105
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,572
It's with me.

106
00:06:52,781 --> 00:06:53,997
Lets drink to that.

107
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,041
Thank you.

108
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:54,576
Congressman Chuatico
is the guy in the sex scandal?

109
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:55,952
Yes,

110
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,454
and he might hurt Trent again.

111
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,650
Why would he do that?

112
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,835
To threaten him.

113
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:07,046
Trent knows that Stephen
is the guy in the video.

114
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:10,200
If the public finds out,
Stephen will be implicated.

115
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,634
Is that even possible?

116
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:16,097
Yes, so we need to find them.

117
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,809
We need to know
what they're talking about.

118
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:26,983
Motherfucker!

119
00:09:28,392 --> 00:09:30,111
Are you going to beat me up?

120
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,363
You're fond of me, aren't you?

121
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:36,867
Does my beaten-up face turn you on?

122
00:09:37,218 --> 00:09:39,345
You're only brave
because you have a gun!

123
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,163
Why don't we
have a fistfight?!

124
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,490
You hardheaded prick!

125
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,209
What now?

126
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,179
You fuckers!

127
00:09:57,204 --> 00:09:58,288
Calm down.

128
00:10:20,248 --> 00:10:22,022
I lost track of them.

129
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,141
Since when did you
become concerned with that actor?

130
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,433
Chief,

131
00:10:42,741 --> 00:10:46,271
we just wanted to make sure
that Trent is safe.

132
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,314
He caused a scene at Em's burial.

133
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:51,192
He deserved to be beaten up.

134
00:10:51,306 --> 00:10:52,808
What if he knows something about...

135
00:10:53,378 --> 00:10:55,422
Congressman Chuatico's involvement
in the case?

136
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,115
But we already have a suspect, right?!

137
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,242
It's Agatha.

138
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:03,079
That's why I sent Armand to the burial

139
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,081
so he could keep an eye on her!

140
00:11:05,349 --> 00:11:07,166
She didn't show up, sir.

141
00:11:07,814 --> 00:11:08,783
My god...

142
00:11:11,115 --> 00:11:14,410
You left, that's why you didn't catch her.

143
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:19,261
You're making this easy case complicated!

144
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,971
Can you please focus?

145
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:32,635
I HAVE A CONFESSION TO MAKE. - TRENT

146
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,179
Congressman Chuatico
is the guy in the sex scandal.

147
00:11:37,936 --> 00:11:38,973
I know.

148
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,536
So there's no point in confessing?

149
00:11:44,781 --> 00:11:47,732
We just made sense of
all the information we've gathered.

150
00:11:48,884 --> 00:11:52,420
That's how we realized that
the tattooed guy in the video....

151
00:11:52,822 --> 00:11:54,297
is Congressman.

152
00:11:55,002 --> 00:11:56,090
But...

153
00:11:57,059 --> 00:11:58,927
maybe you know other things
that we don't know yet.

154
00:12:00,935 --> 00:12:02,347
He threatened me.

155
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,021
He said that he'll get back at me
if I say anything against him.

156
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,062
Is that why you remained quiet?

157
00:12:16,331 --> 00:12:17,946
I didn't want this to get messier,

158
00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:22,517
but I think I made it worse.

159
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,704
Do you think the congressman
has something to do with Em's murder?

160
00:12:29,387 --> 00:12:30,375
Trent,

161
00:12:31,288 --> 00:12:32,502
you can trust me.

162
00:12:38,303 --> 00:12:39,325
I don't know,

163
00:12:40,055 --> 00:12:41,661
but he's my lone suspect.

164
00:12:43,717 --> 00:12:44,722
What if...

165
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,016
Em was planning to say something...

166
00:12:47,402 --> 00:12:49,085
about the sex scandal?

167
00:12:58,535 --> 00:13:00,613
I'm sorry...

168
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,450
I had to leave the burial early.

169
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,686
It's fine.

170
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,706
I'm sure Em would understand.

171
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,791
She wasn't the type
to hold a grudge.

172
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,628
You know,

173
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:18,006
I wasn't at her eighth birthday party.

174
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,785
She was just with her aunts and uncles.

175
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,515
I was in Dubai then, working.

176
00:13:28,218 --> 00:13:29,142
But...

177
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:34,088
she never got mad at me.

178
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,233
She just told me,

179
00:13:37,905 --> 00:13:38,943
"Mom,

180
00:13:40,316 --> 00:13:42,071
I understand."

181
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,017
I'm sorry.

182
00:13:47,268 --> 00:13:49,495
Only the congressman
could be involved in that case.

183
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:53,541
He's the only one who has a motive.

184
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,185
Did Em tell you about this?

185
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,086
No.

186
00:13:57,612 --> 00:13:58,629
It's just my hunch.

187
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:03,884
Ever since he appeared on Em's vlogs,

188
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,637
they had been inseparable.

189
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:10,016
We used to fight a lot about it.

190
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,101
Em always insisted...

191
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:15,171
that they were just friends

192
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,565
until I saw her post.

193
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,526
She was wearing a necklace...

194
00:14:21,096 --> 00:14:22,445
with a half-heart pendant.

195
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,990
She said she was looking
for the other half.

196
00:14:27,939 --> 00:14:31,621
But then when
I watched the congressman on TV,

197
00:14:32,031 --> 00:14:33,664
I saw him wearing
the other half of the pendant.

198
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,085
I wanted to confront Em about it,

199
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,295
but...

200
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,506
the sex scandal blew up.

201
00:14:42,008 --> 00:14:43,616
I knew it was him.

202
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:48,413
I could feel Em's sadness and fear

203
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,156
when she was all alone.

204
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,933
I felt it.

205
00:14:55,034 --> 00:14:58,898
I don't know how I'll be able
to get through this on my own.

206
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,844
Just stay strong, Elaine.

207
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,947
I know it's hard to accept
that Em is gone,

208
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:08,533
but we have no choice...

209
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,619
but to live our lives without her.

210
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,397
She became a part of our lives

211
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,334
and for the most part of it,

212
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,462
she made us happy.

213
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:22,780
She loved us.

214
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:30,096
And that's the one thing we must hold onto.

215
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,182
Why are you  only saying this now?

216
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,727
I couldn't make up my mind back then.

217
00:15:36,866 --> 00:15:37,895
Why?

218
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,440
I did something bad to her.

219
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,359
When we last saw each other,

220
00:15:45,553 --> 00:15:46,988
she said something to me.

221
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,115
She was pregnant...

222
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,909
and she wanted me to own up to it.

223
00:15:51,974 --> 00:15:53,161
I accidentally pushed her.

224
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,038
Are you threatening me?

225
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,499
Why, are you threatened?

226
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:01,752
I pushed her.

227
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:04,130
She bled.

228
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:11,971
And then I left her alone.

229
00:16:13,127 --> 00:16:16,200
Maybe that's the reason
why she took her own life--

230
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,435
she lost her baby.

231
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,421
I felt guilty about what I did.

232
00:16:22,999 --> 00:16:23,858
No,

233
00:16:25,421 --> 00:16:26,819
she didn't have a miscarriage.

234
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,072
What?

235
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,201
The baby was alive

236
00:16:35,498 --> 00:16:36,454
until...

237
00:16:37,013 --> 00:16:38,331
Em was killed.

238
00:16:42,941 --> 00:16:43,942
Thank you.

239
00:16:48,384 --> 00:16:49,468
Where is Joel?

240
00:16:50,621 --> 00:16:52,036
I thought he was sick?

241
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:55,665
He's not here. I kicked him out.
I caught him with another woman.

242
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:02,004
A lot of secrets were revealed
when Em passed away.

243
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:09,945
I'm sorry to hear that.

244
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,473
You don't have to be,

245
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:18,917
unless you're hiding something from me.

246
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,500
What could I hide?

247
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,630
Did you have
an affair with my daughter?

248
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,758
If it wasn't yours,

249
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,095
then whose baby was it?

250
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,180
It was the congressman's.

251
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:42,103
Do you have other suspects
aside from him?

252
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:43,187
There's no other suspect.

253
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:44,922
I'm sure about that.

254
00:17:48,721 --> 00:17:51,554
But we need proof against him.

255
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,822
A solid evidence.

256
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,284
How about the sex scandal?

257
00:17:56,739 --> 00:17:57,660
It can be.

258
00:17:58,872 --> 00:18:01,581
But we need to
establish his motivation,

259
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,000
for example...

260
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,669
that Em was trying blackmail him.

261
00:18:07,955 --> 00:18:10,406
She wouldn't risk her life...

262
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,675
for money.

263
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,443
Em was smart.

264
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:17,847
Who was hit hard
when the scandal blew up?

265
00:18:18,561 --> 00:18:19,974
Only Em, right?

266
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,977
Why did you ask?

267
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,480
You know what I mean.

268
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:30,384
Were you more than friends?

269
00:18:45,511 --> 00:18:48,002
Em kept a lot of secrets from me,

270
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,088
I don't know who else to trust.

271
00:18:52,456 --> 00:18:55,868
So I want you to be honest with me.

272
00:18:56,974 --> 00:18:59,513
Tell me now if you
have something to confess.

273
00:19:32,869 --> 00:19:33,881
I admit,

274
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,038
I courted her.

275
00:19:41,636 --> 00:19:43,766
We used to date before.

276
00:19:45,608 --> 00:19:46,477
And...

277
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:51,190
it was more than friendship for me
because Em was kind.

278
00:19:54,771 --> 00:19:56,064
But believe me,

279
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:58,739
nothing happened.

280
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,032
Nothing happened?

281
00:20:03,232 --> 00:20:04,120
Nothing.

282
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,708
Thank you.

283
00:20:09,434 --> 00:20:11,152
Thank you for your honesty.

284
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,925
I can think of only one person
who could have done it.

285
00:20:19,102 --> 00:20:20,010
Who?

286
00:20:23,537 --> 00:20:25,099
The congressman's wife,

287
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:27,560
Belinda de Dios.

288
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:31,589
That's impossible.

289
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:34,042
But what if she was the one?

290
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,736
She's a de Dios.

291
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,363
They are influential.

292
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,281
They are filthy rich.

293
00:20:41,388 --> 00:20:43,284
They can do those things easily.

294
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:45,661
What if...

295
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:49,582
Belinda found out about the affair

296
00:20:49,888 --> 00:20:50,791
and planned...

297
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:52,472
her revenge?

298
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,796
She uploaded the video
to get back at them.

299
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,716
No.

300
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,261
Belinda cannot do that.

301
00:21:02,544 --> 00:21:03,846
That's not who she is.

302
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,154
Sir, we have a problem.

303
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,501
Senator De Dios and his guards barged in.

304
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,877
They were trying to look for something.

305
00:21:35,902 --> 00:21:37,671
I did't touch anything yet.

306
00:21:43,651 --> 00:21:45,445
Good thing they are starting to panic.

307
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,346
Come again?

308
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,348
Nevermind.

309
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,702
Are you not in good terms
with Mr. Senator?

310
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,780
No, we're good.

311
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,234
They didn't get any documents,

312
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,738
but they took a pendant.

313
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,073
The half-heart one.

314
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,366
They took it.

315
00:22:17,139 --> 00:22:20,005
Tell the staff
to clean up this mess.

316
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,198
Okay, sir.

317
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,073
What are you doing here?

318
00:22:49,148 --> 00:22:50,519
We need to talk.

319
00:22:54,145 --> 00:22:57,902
I like this version of you, Stephen.

320
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,322
You have guts.

321
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,343
I'm done being a pushover.

322
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:12,041
Until when are you
going to keep this up?

323
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,460
Wanna bet?

324
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,769
I'm down for it.

325
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:17,421
And I'm sure

326
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:20,690
you're not going to like it.

327
00:23:20,977 --> 00:23:21,895
What...

328
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,277
do you want?

329
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,348
Stop meddling in my personal life.

330
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:32,019
I need to protect Belinda from pain.

331
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:36,649
I guess you understand
where I'm coming from.

332
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:41,545
You were once a father like me.

333
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:46,675
Okay,

334
00:23:47,454 --> 00:23:48,928
here's the deal:

335
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:53,541
I'll let you and Belinda settle this.

336
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,262
But make sure

337
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:01,131
that you won't hurt her.

338
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,152
You took something from my office.

339
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:07,487
Give it back to me.

340
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:15,871
I didn't know you were into necklaces.

341
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:03,235
No one even remembers
that tulip is your favorite flower.

342
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,907
Don't worry, I brought some for you.

343
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,385
You know what,

344
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:16,332
I still watch your vlogs every day.

345
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,510
I've already memorized them.

346
00:25:34,808 --> 00:25:36,493
I miss you, Em.

347
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,206
I miss your charm...

348
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,500
and kindness.

349
00:25:57,045 --> 00:25:58,682
Why are you crying?

350
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:01,977
Did they hurt you?

351
00:26:02,865 --> 00:26:04,021
Em?

352
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:11,904
I wasn't able to say sorry
the last time we met.

353
00:26:13,831 --> 00:26:14,990
It's okay.

354
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,601
No, it's not.

355
00:26:20,365 --> 00:26:22,581
I violated your privacy.

356
00:26:24,475 --> 00:26:27,419
You had every reason
to get mad at me,

357
00:26:28,002 --> 00:26:29,755
and I understand if you did.

358
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,034
But I wanted to tell you

359
00:26:35,775 --> 00:26:37,444
that you were not alone.

360
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:40,432
That I was just there,

361
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,210
loving you all along.

362
00:26:46,088 --> 00:26:47,981
I was always there for you, too.

363
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,727
No.

364
00:33:42,154 --> 00:33:43,605
She couldn't have done that.

365
00:34:01,192 --> 00:34:02,026
Hello?

366
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:05,293
Are you just going to stay outside?

367
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:06,711
How did you--

368
00:34:07,105 --> 00:34:09,965
Silly, we have CCTVs, you know.

369
00:34:10,234 --> 00:34:12,509
Get in and let's have lunch together.

370
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,814
What the hell were you thinking, Trent?

371
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,509
I told you to stay away from Em's burial!

372
00:34:55,115 --> 00:34:57,329
I already told you not to go there,

373
00:34:57,968 --> 00:34:59,386
but what did you do?

374
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,783
You still chose to go!

375
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:05,562
Look where it got you.
The director is fuming!

376
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:10,566
Trent!

377
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:13,278
Are you even listening to me?

378
00:35:16,574 --> 00:35:21,328
You know that I don't function well
until I've had my morning coffee.

379
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:25,373
Oh my god!

380
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:28,168
The management is going crazy
because of what you did!

381
00:35:29,432 --> 00:35:30,904
I'm ready to face them.

382
00:35:31,902 --> 00:35:38,219
If they are going to sack me
for what I did, so be it!

383
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:41,681
I just wanted to pay my respects.

384
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,975
And what do you think will happen?

385
00:35:44,377 --> 00:35:46,924
Will Em rise from the dead
just because you were there?

386
00:35:47,734 --> 00:35:51,107
- Come on, Trent! Em is dead!
- I know!

387
00:35:55,992 --> 00:35:59,199
I wanted to mourn! I need closure!

388
00:35:59,969 --> 00:36:01,054
Closure?

389
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:05,429
Trent, a dead person can
never give you closure!

390
00:36:05,655 --> 00:36:07,916
You just have to move on from it.

391
00:36:10,749 --> 00:36:12,070
It's not that easy.

392
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:20,679
You should've thought
about our love team!

393
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:24,348
You should've considered our relationship!

394
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:25,934
Love team?

395
00:36:27,098 --> 00:36:29,020
Fuck that!

396
00:36:35,022 --> 00:36:36,148
Fuck you!

397
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:47,080
Fuck...

398
00:36:57,683 --> 00:36:59,592
We finally did it!

399
00:37:00,896 --> 00:37:01,636
Huh?

400
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,847
Stephen and I!

401
00:37:04,041 --> 00:37:06,307
We finally had sex!

402
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,645
It might have been just pity sex.

403
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,689
Of course not, silly!

404
00:37:17,478 --> 00:37:20,655
I felt how much we missed each other.

405
00:37:22,899 --> 00:37:24,242
Did you really feel the love?

406
00:37:27,549 --> 00:37:29,247
What are you trying to say?

407
00:37:30,101 --> 00:37:31,958
I just don't want to keep your hopes up.

408
00:37:32,121 --> 00:37:33,877
You know what they say,

409
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,713
"Hope is the seed of desperation."

410
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:38,840
Of course,

411
00:37:39,207 --> 00:37:42,010
because when we love, we also hope.

412
00:37:42,308 --> 00:37:47,015
And that love is now being
reciprocated by Stephen.

413
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,711
We're patching things up.
We're fixing our relationship.

414
00:37:53,008 --> 00:37:56,508
And I'm looking forward
to our trip to Europe.

415
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:00,945
Why were you staying outside, anyway?

416
00:38:02,819 --> 00:38:04,240
Nothing. I just missed you.

417
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,867
I thought you weren't home...

418
00:38:06,403 --> 00:38:07,827
so I didn't go in.

419
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,438
I missed you, too, sis!

420
00:38:13,454 --> 00:38:14,667
Cheers.

421
00:38:27,113 --> 00:38:29,824
Where have you been?
Mrs. Celera has been waiting for you.

422
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,851
Go up. The press conference
is about to start.

423
00:38:32,085 --> 00:38:33,044
Okay.

424
00:38:36,479 --> 00:38:39,592
We already have a suspect
for Em Celera's murder.

425
00:38:40,877 --> 00:38:42,529
She is Agatha David,

426
00:38:42,707 --> 00:38:45,573
Twenty-five years old.
A former resident of Laong Laan, Manila.

427
00:38:46,459 --> 00:38:48,993
What do you think is
her motive for killing Em?

428
00:38:50,832 --> 00:38:56,209
We're suspecting it's fatal obssession.

429
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:58,837
Fuck this girl.

430
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:03,424
For the manhunt operation,

431
00:39:03,606 --> 00:39:07,846
Ligtas Partylist is offering
a two-million-peso reward.

432
00:39:09,216 --> 00:39:12,517
So we can expedite the process.

433
00:39:12,651 --> 00:39:15,478
And whoever hands her over to us...

434
00:39:15,503 --> 00:39:17,438
What took you so long, Agent Esguerra?

435
00:39:17,463 --> 00:39:20,191
I'm sorry, Chief.
I was following up another lead.

436
00:39:21,399 --> 00:39:22,861
Why is he offering a cash reward?

437
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:24,445
This could mess up the case.

438
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:28,132
We already talked about it
and I said yes.

439
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:30,826
I'm begging you,

440
00:39:31,628 --> 00:39:35,373
please help me find justice
for my daughter.

441
00:39:36,156 --> 00:39:40,744
If you know where
Agatha David is hiding,

442
00:39:40,932 --> 00:39:45,274
please inform  the police and the PBI.

443
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,969
I just want justice for my daughter.

444
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,228
I just want to make things clear:

445
00:39:57,603 --> 00:40:00,899
We need to find justice not just for Em

446
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,484
because two of them died.

447
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,238
Don't you dare say it.

448
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,908
Em was pregnant when she was killed.

449
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,698
Look at what you did.

450
00:40:26,288 --> 00:40:30,319
What does this mean?
Is the guy in the sex scandal the father?

451
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:35,041
Are you sure about that?
How did you find out?

452
00:40:57,162 --> 00:40:59,666
Em's pregnancy
was supposed to be a secret!

453
00:40:59,691 --> 00:41:02,736
I decided to remove you
from Em Celera's case.

454
00:41:02,761 --> 00:41:04,963
- Do you think I don't know the truth?
- What do you know?

455
00:41:04,988 --> 00:41:06,689
You two were having an affair

456
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,496
but I never confronted you about it!

457
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:11,965
- You animal!
- Elaine--

458
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:14,221
You're the man in the sex scandal!

459
00:41:14,246 --> 00:41:16,582
This is sensational
because the congressman is now involved.

460
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:18,325
This will blow up, Mr. Congressman.

461
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:19,811
Fuck you, Stephen!

462
00:41:19,836 --> 00:41:22,772
If you can cheat, so can I.
