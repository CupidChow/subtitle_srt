1
00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:08,653
Ms. Elaine Celera, this is my agent.

2
00:00:08,737 --> 00:00:10,297
She will handle
the case of your daughter.

3
00:00:10,322 --> 00:00:12,866
Take the Celera case.
This is sensational.

4
00:00:12,908 --> 00:00:14,301
What's in it for you, Stephen?

5
00:00:14,326 --> 00:00:16,494
I want to give her the
justice she deserves.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,207
That's what you get
for sleeping around!

7
00:00:22,882 --> 00:00:25,337
You were with Em
the night before she died.

8
00:00:25,337 --> 00:00:26,129
Em was pregnant.

9
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:27,255
Pregnant with you?

10
00:00:27,255 --> 00:00:30,592
There is a local army
that is being led by a local politician.

11
00:00:30,592 --> 00:00:31,593
Soon we'll raid their hideout.

12
00:00:31,593 --> 00:00:32,969
I hope you die.

13
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:32,529
LET'S HAVE DINNER TOGETHER.
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY!

14
00:02:45,727 --> 00:02:47,103
I need to do this, Mom.

15
00:02:47,812 --> 00:02:52,275
I need to make my presence felt
so the public won't forget me.

16
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,781
Don't let negativity affect you.

17
00:02:57,781 --> 00:03:00,533
Stay strong
because we're always here for you, okay?

18
00:03:01,743 --> 00:03:04,204
Everything will be okay, sweetheart.

19
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:06,818
Mom...

20
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,340
I love you.

21
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:12,634
I love you, Em.

22
00:05:16,758 --> 00:05:18,343
Put this over there.

23
00:05:20,011 --> 00:05:21,930
Please adjust this.

24
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:23,765
That one too.

25
00:05:29,353 --> 00:05:30,521
There.

26
00:05:32,982 --> 00:05:35,944
You might want to rest first.

27
00:05:37,408 --> 00:05:39,118
It's gonna be a long night.

28
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,241
I can still manage.

29
00:05:43,493 --> 00:05:45,954
Alright. Just call me
if you need help.

30
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,123
I'll have you
picked up by my driver.

31
00:05:48,123 --> 00:05:49,583
Thank you.

32
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,177
Why are you late?
Where have you been?

33
00:06:01,219 --> 00:06:04,389
I processed
Em's death certificate.

34
00:06:07,446 --> 00:06:10,979
You should've told me.
I could've done it myself.

35
00:06:11,521 --> 00:06:13,398
It's alright, Sir.
Thank you.

36
00:06:28,452 --> 00:06:31,541
Oh, what's the occasion?

37
00:06:36,217 --> 00:06:38,773
You've also forgotten?

38
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,067
Of course not!

39
00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:42,610
How can I forget?

40
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:44,070
Of course, I know!

41
00:06:44,554 --> 00:06:46,139
This is the day.

42
00:06:46,556 --> 00:06:51,311
The anniversary of your misery.

43
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:55,816
Stop it, Dad.

44
00:06:56,441 --> 00:06:58,359
I was just kidding.

45
00:07:01,905 --> 00:07:03,406
But knowing you,

46
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:06,659
your jokes are half-meant.

47
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:09,955
So...

48
00:07:11,748 --> 00:07:14,792
where's that son of a bitch?

49
00:07:17,754 --> 00:07:18,922
At work.

50
00:07:21,216 --> 00:07:23,318
We worked together once, you know.

51
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,263
I know when he's working or not.

52
00:07:31,392 --> 00:07:33,645
Looks like you
cooked a delicious meal.

53
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,689
I think I'll join you

54
00:07:37,815 --> 00:07:39,442
for this celebration.

55
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,404
Next time

56
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,825
I see your husband,

57
00:07:48,117 --> 00:07:50,287
I'll show him
who he's messing with.

58
00:07:53,164 --> 00:07:54,832
Please, Dad.
Don't hurt him.

59
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,543
Real talk.

60
00:07:58,503 --> 00:08:00,713
Man to man.

61
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:08,430
I don't like it when
someone's hurting my baby girl.

62
00:08:15,853 --> 00:08:18,607
Mr. Congressman, can we talk?

63
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,066
Sure.

64
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,736
What is this about?

65
00:08:24,862 --> 00:08:27,115
I appreciate all
the help you've been giving us.

66
00:08:27,851 --> 00:08:28,658
Okay...

67
00:08:28,992 --> 00:08:32,495
Let's get things straight--

68
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,042
are you courting my wife?

69
00:08:42,505 --> 00:08:43,381
Joel...

70
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:46,810
Your wife has always been good
to me that's why we became close.

71
00:08:49,144 --> 00:08:50,639
There's nothing more to it.

72
00:08:53,016 --> 00:08:55,312
You've always been
hanging around my wife.

73
00:08:55,455 --> 00:08:58,855
Even before Em died.

74
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,611
Just like what I told you,

75
00:09:08,619 --> 00:09:09,787
I have my own wife.

76
00:09:11,034 --> 00:09:12,452
I'm just repaying
your family's kindness.

77
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,872
How about Em?

78
00:09:19,744 --> 00:09:21,419
Em was a friend.

79
00:09:23,486 --> 00:09:24,487
You know what,

80
00:09:25,201 --> 00:09:28,551
your family has helped
me win the elections.

81
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:33,306
So this is just my way of giving back.

82
00:09:41,898 --> 00:09:43,458
Do you have further questions, Joel?

83
00:09:45,276 --> 00:09:46,319
I have no more questions.

84
00:09:49,157 --> 00:09:50,033
I'm good.

85
00:10:31,392 --> 00:10:32,215
What now?

86
00:10:35,648 --> 00:10:36,732
Let's go, Armand.

87
00:10:37,335 --> 00:10:38,378
Go where?

88
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:40,665
To the farm.

89
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,593
This is where
the suspect ran after Em.

90
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,397
And that is where she was killed.

91
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,068
Then she was hung right after.

92
00:11:10,027 --> 00:11:12,989
But unknowingly,
the suspect left some evidence.

93
00:11:14,782 --> 00:11:18,328
Some sort of signature
that he unconsciously created.

94
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:26,711
Blake's Hitch.

95
00:11:30,131 --> 00:11:31,382
There! Found it!

96
00:11:32,216 --> 00:11:32,900
That one?

97
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:33,718
Yes.

98
00:11:33,885 --> 00:11:36,362
It's the type of knot
used by tree surgeons.

99
00:11:36,971 --> 00:11:38,807
They do it to
strengthen the branches.

100
00:11:41,017 --> 00:11:42,310
Good day!

101
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:47,832
Ms. Elaine asked me to assist you.

102
00:11:47,857 --> 00:11:49,125
Can I ask you
a question, sir?

103
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:49,876
Go ahead.

104
00:11:49,901 --> 00:11:51,653
Who among you here knows
how to do a Blake's Hitch?

105
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:53,905
That one?

106
00:11:54,697 --> 00:11:57,742
It must be Sir Joel.
He was the one who cut the rope.

107
00:12:12,743 --> 00:12:13,733
Good afternoon.

108
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:15,051
How are you?

109
00:12:21,891 --> 00:12:22,976
My condolences.

110
00:12:54,882 --> 00:12:56,551
Look. The PBI agents are here.

111
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:04,825
Do you have updates,
Agent Esguerra?

112
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,185
My condolences, ma'am.

113
00:13:09,011 --> 00:13:11,774
May we invite you
for questioning, Mr. Carandang?

114
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,168
Why?

115
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,529
We just want to
clarify some things.

116
00:13:18,489 --> 00:13:20,283
Is my husband
a probable suspect?

117
00:13:20,613 --> 00:13:22,869
He's one of the
persons of interest.

118
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,914
Don't worry.
This will just be quick.

119
00:13:26,455 --> 00:13:27,807
I'm innocent, anyway.

120
00:13:27,966 --> 00:13:29,218
Let's go, Mr. Carandang.

121
00:13:29,906 --> 00:13:30,781
Go.

122
00:14:13,542 --> 00:14:14,626
You just arrived?

123
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:21,427
I went to my friend
Caloy's place for some drinks.

124
00:14:22,794 --> 00:14:24,973
We didn't notice the time.

125
00:14:28,184 --> 00:14:29,268
Why are you still up?

126
00:14:29,815 --> 00:14:32,150
I had a nightmare.

127
00:14:32,175 --> 00:14:34,065
Can we go to the farm?

128
00:14:35,313 --> 00:14:36,147
Right now?

129
00:14:36,233 --> 00:14:37,694
Let's check on Em.

130
00:14:39,036 --> 00:14:40,287
Come on, Elaine.

131
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,424
It's already late.

132
00:14:42,531 --> 00:14:44,784
Can't you just call her?

133
00:14:44,992 --> 00:14:47,912
I feel anxious. I just want to
make sure she's okay.

134
00:14:48,113 --> 00:14:49,330
Let's go, please?

135
00:14:52,186 --> 00:14:53,960
I'm not in the mood to drive.

136
00:14:54,669 --> 00:14:55,711
What if

137
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,170
I take a rest first and then

138
00:14:59,686 --> 00:15:02,010
I'll drive you to the farm?

139
00:15:04,034 --> 00:15:05,160
Okay?

140
00:15:12,353 --> 00:15:14,038
Do you think
Joel could have done it?

141
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:16,774
I don't know.

142
00:15:19,902 --> 00:15:22,988
I'm sorry. I just wanna be alone for now.

143
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:27,827
Okay. Take a rest.

144
00:15:29,276 --> 00:15:30,872
I'll take care of the press.

145
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,835
Mr. Carandang,

146
00:15:36,377 --> 00:15:42,342
where were you that night
between 11:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m.?

147
00:15:45,469 --> 00:15:46,762
I was at the house of...

148
00:15:48,764 --> 00:15:50,183
I was at the house
of my friend Caloy.

149
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,560
We were having a drink.

150
00:15:53,133 --> 00:15:56,689
But we were told
that you arrived home at 11:00.

151
00:15:59,019 --> 00:16:00,943
And then you were gone
for another three hours.

152
00:16:01,951 --> 00:16:03,780
It was during that time that...

153
00:16:05,621 --> 00:16:07,158
Em was killed.

154
00:16:10,953 --> 00:16:12,205
I need a lawyer.

155
00:16:18,586 --> 00:16:20,755
Are you hiding something, Mr. Carandang?

156
00:16:21,088 --> 00:16:22,339
I need a lawyer.

157
00:16:22,828 --> 00:16:24,217
I know my rights.

158
00:16:27,148 --> 00:16:28,387
I won't say anything.

159
00:16:30,264 --> 00:16:31,157
Alright.

160
00:16:31,182 --> 00:16:32,725
If that's what you want.

161
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:44,195
EM'S STEPDAD TAGGED AS SUSPECT

162
00:16:58,198 --> 00:16:59,435
Don't answer it!

163
00:17:00,335 --> 00:17:01,687
Hello?

164
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:03,147
Hello, Em.

165
00:17:05,719 --> 00:17:06,692
Yes?

166
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,887
I'm sorry, are you busy?

167
00:17:12,576 --> 00:17:14,742
Not really.
I'm just here on the set.

168
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,954
Why? Is there a problem with my account?

169
00:17:18,848 --> 00:17:19,914
No...

170
00:17:20,967 --> 00:17:24,345
I just noticed that
your Uncle Joel made some transfers.

171
00:17:26,906 --> 00:17:27,716
Okay.

172
00:17:27,741 --> 00:17:29,075
Hold on.

173
00:17:29,242 --> 00:17:30,827
I'll just answer this.

174
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:37,206
Yes, he's in charge of handling
my bills. What about it?

175
00:17:37,842 --> 00:17:40,001
Em, this is a newly enrolled account.

176
00:17:40,738 --> 00:17:42,353
I can't trace the name.

177
00:17:42,545 --> 00:17:44,797
This looks like a personal account.

178
00:17:45,058 --> 00:17:47,842
The transfers were
unusual and quite large.

179
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:02,148
Do you think Uncle Joel
is stealing from me?

180
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:04,959
What?

181
00:18:54,122 --> 00:18:56,177
I heard what
happened to you.

182
00:18:57,211 --> 00:18:58,955
Who beat you up?

183
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:01,118
I don't know.

184
00:19:02,383 --> 00:19:03,484
Just a gang of thugs, I guess.

185
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:05,711
Have you reported
this to the police?

186
00:19:05,988 --> 00:19:07,964
Does your manager
know about this?

187
00:19:09,457 --> 00:19:10,383
No need.

188
00:19:11,232 --> 00:19:12,426
No need.

189
00:19:13,144 --> 00:19:14,887
Are you sure you're okay?

190
00:19:19,442 --> 00:19:20,893
I was worried about you.

191
00:19:23,738 --> 00:19:25,147
To be honest,

192
00:19:26,741 --> 00:19:28,651
when I found out
what happened,

193
00:19:29,232 --> 00:19:30,736
I thought

194
00:19:31,354 --> 00:19:32,613
karma has been served.

195
00:19:34,743 --> 00:19:36,534
But I was terrified.

196
00:19:37,981 --> 00:19:39,649
I was worried, Trent.

197
00:19:41,672 --> 00:19:43,541
I can't stand being
away from you after all.

198
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:47,169
I'm sorry if I got you worried.

199
00:19:48,012 --> 00:19:50,089
Only you can
make me feel this way.

200
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:53,593
You erased all
my anger in an instant.

201
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:58,939
You have the power to
mess with my emotions.

202
00:20:02,382 --> 00:20:03,327
At least,

203
00:20:03,823 --> 00:20:06,076
you'll have more to
draw from in your scenes.

204
00:20:06,311 --> 00:20:07,481
Crazy!

205
00:20:09,492 --> 00:20:11,861
You think you're a good actor?

206
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:18,542
So, are we good?

207
00:20:21,717 --> 00:20:22,705
Lay here beside me.

208
00:20:33,384 --> 00:20:34,427
I missed you.

209
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:36,510
I missed you, too.

210
00:23:11,048 --> 00:23:18,806
HAVE YOU SEEN
EM'S LAST MESSAGE ON INSTAGRAM?

211
00:23:25,535 --> 00:23:27,306
Ms. Patricia, your mom!

212
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:33,545
THERE IS NO BIG
ANNOUNCEMENT COMING.

213
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:34,967
SHE ALREADY SAID
EVERYTHING SHE WANTED TO SAY.

214
00:23:34,992 --> 00:23:36,117
JUST LOOK CLOSELY.

215
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:39,034
- What's happening?
- She's having a seizure.

216
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:40,244
Mom?

217
00:23:40,739 --> 00:23:41,470
Mom?

218
00:23:41,495 --> 00:23:43,197
Quick! Call an ambulance!

219
00:23:43,681 --> 00:23:44,573
Mom?

220
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:46,175
Mom?

221
00:23:46,437 --> 00:23:47,246
Mom?

222
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:48,978
Hang on,
I'm here to save you.

223
00:23:49,003 --> 00:23:50,272
Hold on, Mom.

224
00:23:50,297 --> 00:23:51,382
I'm just here for you.

225
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:52,805
You'll survive.

226
00:23:57,803 --> 00:23:59,271
Keep fighting, Mom.

227
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:03,442
I'm here. I love you so much, Mom.

228
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:22,419
I have something
juicy for all of you!

229
00:24:22,444 --> 00:24:24,655
Something explosive!

230
00:24:25,251 --> 00:24:28,951
So just keep in touch, Em-nation!

231
00:24:54,305 --> 00:24:56,587
I have something
juicy for all of you!

232
00:24:56,612 --> 00:24:58,148
Something explosive!

233
00:25:00,741 --> 00:25:01,867
Shit!

234
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:02,993
Is there
something wrong, ma'am?

235
00:25:03,282 --> 00:25:04,962
I'm sorry.

236
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:11,877
- Good evening.
- Good evening, doc.

237
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:14,622
I'm Dr. Manuela.
Are you patient Esguerra's relative?

238
00:25:14,797 --> 00:25:17,132
Yes, I am her daughter.
Good evening.

239
00:25:17,132 --> 00:25:18,342
I'll just check on her.

240
00:25:18,342 --> 00:25:19,251
Yes, doc.

241
00:25:35,275 --> 00:25:36,852
How's my mom, doc?

242
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,988
I'll be honest with you.

243
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:42,124
She's not well.

244
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:44,593
Her vital signs are stable,

245
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:46,587
but she's unresponsive.

246
00:25:46,868 --> 00:25:48,839
Right now, our course of action

247
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,033
is to endorse her
to our neurosurgeon.

248
00:25:51,667 --> 00:25:54,753
We'll run some lab tests
tonight and tomorrow morning.

249
00:25:55,068 --> 00:25:56,580
We'll also have a scan of her brain.

250
00:25:57,631 --> 00:26:00,150
Does she have
any relatives abroad

251
00:26:00,175 --> 00:26:02,594
who we can inform
about her condition?

252
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:06,048
None, doc.
It's just the two of us.

253
00:26:08,016 --> 00:26:10,769
Alright. I'll just update you.

254
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:12,930
Thank you, doc.

255
00:26:32,166 --> 00:26:37,254
DID YOU READ MY MESSAGE?

256
00:26:38,422 --> 00:26:43,760
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT, RIGHT?

257
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:50,642
DID YOU READ MY MESSAGE?

258
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:52,811
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, RIGHT?

259
00:26:52,939 --> 00:26:53,846
So annoying!

260
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,253
I have something
juicy for all of you!

261
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:03,914
Something explosive!

262
00:27:04,198 --> 00:27:06,458
So just keep in touch, Em-nation!

263
00:27:07,701 --> 00:27:09,044
What could it be?

264
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:17,476
Hello?

265
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,222
I'm sorry.
Did I wake you up?

266
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,249
I'm not in the mood
for small talk, Armand.

267
00:27:23,967 --> 00:27:25,802
Can you come  back to the office?

268
00:27:26,595 --> 00:27:30,432
Joel isn't answering
any of our questions.

269
00:27:30,614 --> 00:27:31,533
I feel like

270
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:32,885
I'm useless here.

271
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:35,287
How long has
he been on hold?

272
00:27:35,483 --> 00:27:36,805
Almost seven hours.

273
00:27:38,979 --> 00:27:40,350
Is his lawyer there already?

274
00:27:41,271 --> 00:27:42,411
No, his lawyer is not here yet.

275
00:27:44,988 --> 00:27:46,565
Fine. I'll go there.

276
00:27:55,004 --> 00:27:56,341
I'll go ahead.

277
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:57,634
Okay, ma'am.

278
00:28:01,922 --> 00:28:02,998
Look after her, okay?

279
00:28:17,142 --> 00:28:18,488
Something funny?

280
00:28:23,151 --> 00:28:24,603
Yes, your partner.

281
00:28:25,257 --> 00:28:30,692
He really needed to drag you back here
to pry out answers from me.

282
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:39,159
Is that how incompetent

283
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,578
our agents are
here in the Philippines?

284
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:48,051
We try our best.

285
00:28:50,282 --> 00:28:51,296
Your best?

286
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:54,383
If that's your best,

287
00:28:55,282 --> 00:28:58,137
then you won't solve
any cases in this country.

288
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:07,187
How bold of you to accuse me

289
00:29:08,405 --> 00:29:10,824
of killing my own daughter.

290
00:29:11,423 --> 00:29:12,734
Stepdaughter.

291
00:29:17,638 --> 00:29:19,199
My lawyer called me.

292
00:29:19,844 --> 00:29:20,951
I already talked to him.

293
00:29:22,158 --> 00:29:23,871
He forbade me from speaking.

294
00:29:25,292 --> 00:29:26,974
So you won't get anything from me.

295
00:29:29,751 --> 00:29:32,004
No, Mr. Carandang.

296
00:29:32,935 --> 00:29:34,673
This is just a small talk.

297
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,927
What's your favorite plant?

298
00:29:43,617 --> 00:29:45,017
I don't smoke weed.

299
00:29:47,847 --> 00:29:50,314
And cannabis is the first thing
you thought of?

300
00:29:51,451 --> 00:29:52,582
Silly you!

301
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:55,777
I'm talking about plants.

302
00:29:56,593 --> 00:29:57,713
Trees.

303
00:29:59,925 --> 00:30:01,783
What's your favorite plant?

304
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:06,413
Do you climb trees?

305
00:30:09,322 --> 00:30:10,600
What kind of question is that?

306
00:30:11,866 --> 00:30:13,462
What does that
have to do with the case?

307
00:30:14,468 --> 00:30:15,964
Stop wasting my time.

308
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:28,644
Can you see this knot?

309
00:30:30,174 --> 00:30:33,232
This is the same knot
that was used to hang Em.

310
00:30:33,946 --> 00:30:35,442
Can you visualize her

311
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,697
with her eyes and tongue popped out?

312
00:30:43,169 --> 00:30:46,411
A far cry from the Em that the fans loved.

313
00:30:52,175 --> 00:30:53,835
They got it from your farmhouse.

314
00:30:54,761 --> 00:30:56,004
Blake's Hitch.

315
00:30:57,451 --> 00:31:00,150
And it's not as common as you think.

316
00:31:02,967 --> 00:31:03,862
So,

317
00:31:06,314 --> 00:31:08,475
you'll use that as
evidence to implicate me?

318
00:31:09,293 --> 00:31:10,410
Bullshit!

319
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:17,818
I've been teaching Em
survival skills since she was a kid.

320
00:31:18,593 --> 00:31:19,836
I taught her how to swim,

321
00:31:20,034 --> 00:31:21,421
how to ride a bicycle,

322
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,156
and how to knot a rope.

323
00:31:25,075 --> 00:31:26,218
Full 8!

324
00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:27,911
Clove Hitch!

325
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:29,888
Butterfly Knot.

326
00:31:30,797 --> 00:31:32,516
Em knew all of those things!

327
00:31:33,649 --> 00:31:35,484
And even if
she's not my daughter,

328
00:31:36,688 --> 00:31:38,797
I treated her as
my own flesh and blood.

329
00:31:40,135 --> 00:31:41,216
Just a question:

330
00:31:41,784 --> 00:31:43,343
Who do you think was the reason

331
00:31:43,852 --> 00:31:45,804
why she joined the Girl Scouts?

332
00:31:47,186 --> 00:31:51,476
Who was the reason
why she joined the Citizens Army Training?

333
00:31:53,851 --> 00:31:55,856
And now you're accusing me...

334
00:31:58,241 --> 00:32:00,235
of killing my own daughter?!

335
00:32:02,952 --> 00:32:04,239
Mr. Carandang,

336
00:32:05,535 --> 00:32:07,367
enough with the drama.

337
00:32:10,992 --> 00:32:14,875
I was informed
that last month,

338
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:16,960
you and Em had a fight

339
00:32:18,889 --> 00:32:20,464
and that you almost hit her.

340
00:32:21,778 --> 00:32:22,937
What happened?

341
00:32:24,004 --> 00:32:25,719
What did you fight about?

342
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,639
You still don't want to talk

343
00:32:30,334 --> 00:32:32,211
until you have your lawyer here?

344
00:32:35,768 --> 00:32:36,769
Fine.

345
00:32:39,136 --> 00:32:41,193
Let's see who gives in first.

346
00:32:48,917 --> 00:32:52,537
Em discovered all the bank transfers
that I made.

347
00:32:52,957 --> 00:32:54,790
She had been spying on me since then.

348
00:32:56,984 --> 00:32:59,586
Until she discovered
that I'm having an affair.

349
00:33:01,735 --> 00:33:04,424
She's the one
I've been sending the money to.

350
00:33:53,971 --> 00:33:55,517
I never left Elaine.

351
00:33:56,696 --> 00:34:00,856
My woman never
asked for anything.

352
00:34:01,845 --> 00:34:02,899
Not even money.

353
00:34:07,186 --> 00:34:09,297
I tried explaining to Em.

354
00:34:10,123 --> 00:34:11,383
I told her that,

355
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:14,185
I just needed to fulfill my own needs.

356
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:15,637
But she got mad.

357
00:34:15,931 --> 00:34:17,330
She kicked me out of our house.

358
00:34:21,966 --> 00:34:23,092
I loved Em.

359
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:27,716
I loved her
like my own child.

360
00:34:30,002 --> 00:34:36,725
It pains me to know that
my stupidity ruined our relationship.

361
00:34:39,209 --> 00:34:41,021
But I will never--

362
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:45,275
I will never kill my own daughter.

363
00:35:38,382 --> 00:35:42,374
I'm sorry, but we
need to release Joel.

364
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:47,420
Here's the result from the DNA sample.

365
00:36:12,711 --> 00:36:14,172
Are you okay?

366
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:17,115
Are you okay?

367
00:36:20,503 --> 00:36:21,705
We have his lawyer.

368
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:22,856
Release him now!

369
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:24,391
We're actually done with him.

370
00:36:24,561 --> 00:36:27,586
We've got all
the information that we need.

371
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,379
You may bring him home.

372
00:36:30,029 --> 00:36:31,106
Thank you, ma'am.

373
00:36:31,206 --> 00:36:34,843
Are you sure you're okay?
Did they hurt you?

374
00:36:41,492 --> 00:36:43,457
- Were you hurt?
- I'm okay.

375
00:36:43,482 --> 00:36:45,045
Ma'am, we didn't hurt him.

376
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,446
I'm not asking you!

377
00:36:46,868 --> 00:36:49,788
How dare you involve my husband?!

378
00:36:50,076 --> 00:36:51,668
You even took him away from the wake!

379
00:36:52,581 --> 00:36:55,547
Are you just going
to point fingers at anyone

380
00:36:55,572 --> 00:36:57,006
just to close the case?!

381
00:36:57,149 --> 00:36:58,550
You're a bunch of useless pricks!

382
00:36:58,856 --> 00:36:59,784
Let's go!

383
00:37:00,344 --> 00:37:01,563
Let's go, Joel.

384
00:37:03,353 --> 00:37:04,187
Stupid!

385
00:38:41,144 --> 00:38:42,612
Wanda, let me just warn you.

386
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,989
He'll just use you.

387
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,392
It's none of your business!

388
00:38:50,612 --> 00:38:51,688
Motherfucker!

389
00:39:00,788 --> 00:39:01,598
Hello, ma'am!

390
00:39:01,623 --> 00:39:02,549
Yes?

391
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:04,551
Good news, ma'am!

392
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:06,386
Your mom is already responsive!

393
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:08,646
How?

394
00:39:08,671 --> 00:39:10,648
I tried talking to her,

395
00:39:10,673 --> 00:39:12,817
she answered
using her fingers.

396
00:39:12,842 --> 00:39:14,344
She was pointing
them upwards.

397
00:39:14,627 --> 00:39:15,837
May I see?

398
00:39:15,862 --> 00:39:17,230
Hang on, ma'am, just a sec.

399
00:39:17,305 --> 00:39:18,215
Here you go.

400
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,067
But she's already sleeping.

401
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:22,176
Here she is.

402
00:39:24,051 --> 00:39:25,113
There.

403
00:39:26,648 --> 00:39:28,366
Alright.
I'm on my way there.

404
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:30,410
I wanna see how
my mom will respond.

405
00:39:30,443 --> 00:39:32,453
- Okay, ma'am. We'll wait for you.
- Okay.

406
00:39:47,783 --> 00:39:49,996
- Let's take a break, miss.
- Finally!

407
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:54,893
Show it to him.

408
00:39:57,434 --> 00:39:58,313
Is that the same as this?

409
00:39:58,681 --> 00:39:59,516
Let me see.

410
00:39:59,626 --> 00:40:00,523
Yes, it is.

411
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:02,700
You know who owns that tattoo?

412
00:40:02,725 --> 00:40:04,410
I have this design in my file.

413
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:05,954
When I saw it on the sex video,

414
00:40:05,979 --> 00:40:08,865
it looked so familiar.

415
00:40:09,399 --> 00:40:12,126
But are you aware

416
00:40:12,151 --> 00:40:14,120
that this a reproduction?

417
00:40:14,737 --> 00:40:17,232
They just copied that
design from another artist.

418
00:40:20,034 --> 00:40:21,411
Here, look.

419
00:40:22,328 --> 00:40:23,429
This is the original.

420
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:24,931
It was designed by an
artist from Vietnam.

421
00:40:24,956 --> 00:40:26,307
He creates original designs.

422
00:40:26,332 --> 00:40:30,662
That means the guy in
the video belongs to an elite group.

423
00:40:46,557 --> 00:40:47,475
Hello?

424
00:40:49,564 --> 00:40:51,074
Any updates?

425
00:40:51,099 --> 00:40:53,785
We already have some
information about the tattoo.

426
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:56,713
I decided not to tell you
yet so you can rest.

427
00:40:56,738 --> 00:40:58,982
Alright. Be careful.

428
00:41:23,336 --> 00:41:24,424
Who are you?

429
00:41:26,558 --> 00:41:27,927
Let's talk things out.

430
00:41:53,906 --> 00:41:55,057
Excuse me, ma'am.

431
00:41:55,082 --> 00:41:56,831
I'll just replace the fluid bags.

432
00:41:57,321 --> 00:41:58,322
Alright.

433
00:42:12,271 --> 00:42:20,947
HELLO. SORRY FOR LAST NIGHT.
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE SAMANIEGO CASE?

434
00:42:23,449 --> 00:42:31,499
SAMANIEGO CASE? ADMIT IT.
JUST SAY YOU MISS ME.

435
00:42:31,874 --> 00:42:34,627
UPDATE?

436
00:42:38,172 --> 00:42:39,674
FUCK YOU

437
00:42:39,877 --> 00:42:42,377
Ma'am, look!

438
00:42:46,185 --> 00:42:47,131
Mom?

439
00:42:48,041 --> 00:42:48,858
Mom!

440
00:42:49,331 --> 00:42:50,468
Mom, can you hear me?

441
00:42:52,949 --> 00:42:54,222
It's me, Patricia.

442
00:42:58,167 --> 00:42:59,352
This is good news.

443
00:43:00,281 --> 00:43:02,981
I told you so.
I wasn't dreaming.

444
00:43:19,297 --> 00:43:23,634
YOU'RE STUPID!

445
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:30,675
Em-nation, just keep in touch.

446
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,224
How is it going?

447
00:44:28,911 --> 00:44:30,109
"I'm pregnant."

448
00:44:31,008 --> 00:44:32,420
Seems like she had a lot more to say.

449
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:34,363
Is that accurate?

450
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:39,772
Can we double check?

451
00:44:39,797 --> 00:44:40,912
That's what I decoded.

452
00:44:51,639 --> 00:44:55,551
She was planning to
reveal the identity of the father.

453
00:45:06,085 --> 00:45:06,988
You were looking for me?

454
00:45:06,988 --> 00:45:07,797
I'm Choi.

455
00:45:07,822 --> 00:45:08,965
I'm not a troll.

456
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:09,907
I'm a web sleuth.

457
00:45:09,932 --> 00:45:13,177
This is still the same
hand that feeds you.

458
00:45:13,202 --> 00:45:14,120
I went here because--

459
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,422
I don't care what your reason is, miss.

460
00:45:16,523 --> 00:45:18,224
You invaded my privacy.

461
00:45:18,249 --> 00:45:19,475
Here is our prime suspect--

462
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,468
Agatha David.

463
00:45:20,907 --> 00:45:22,345
Were you Em's stalker?

464
00:45:23,004 --> 00:45:24,814
Were you spying on her?

465
00:45:24,839 --> 00:45:27,191
Let's show them
that we are okay.

466
00:45:27,216 --> 00:45:29,685
You're going to use
me to deflect the issue?

467
00:45:31,137 --> 00:45:33,598
BE CAREFUL!
