1
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,574
I was shocked! Can you imagine?

2
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,854
Hi, guys! I'm begging you,

3
00:01:19,054 --> 00:01:21,539
especially those who
are sharing the video--

4
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,374
What the fuck is this?

5
00:01:23,467 --> 00:01:25,711
Em Celera has a sex scandal.

6
00:01:25,736 --> 00:01:29,008
I just want to remind
you that Em is still a girl.

7
00:01:29,033 --> 00:01:34,369
In all fairness, I didn't expect it.
But it was good, so let's not judge Em.

8
00:01:44,989 --> 00:01:46,282
It's going viral.

9
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:51,987
The Em that you're so crazy for
has been doing nasty things!

10
00:01:52,012 --> 00:01:54,865
I don't care. She's still my idol.

11
00:01:55,434 --> 00:01:58,869
Well, you're idolizing a sex maniac!

12
00:02:00,104 --> 00:02:02,789
Oh my god. Is that Em?

13
00:02:02,814 --> 00:02:04,441
Tea time, guys!

14
00:02:04,705 --> 00:02:11,214
I'm sure you've already seen
Em Celera's viral sex scandal video.

15
00:02:11,482 --> 00:02:13,651
The influencer, Em Celera.

16
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:17,204
I was shocked. Did Em really do that?

17
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,948
The protective prince of the heavenly host,
Saint Michael the Archangel,

18
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:41,270
we humbly pray that you always protect us

19
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:44,523
from all the temptations on earth.

20
00:02:44,676 --> 00:02:47,109
Guard us against
the snares of the devil. Amen.

21
00:02:48,737 --> 00:02:50,322
- Amen.
- Amen.

22
00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:09,423
Game! Let's do this!

23
00:03:12,986 --> 00:03:14,237
Freeze!

24
00:03:29,128 --> 00:03:29,985
I said freeze!

25
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:41,012
Freeze!

26
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:39,672
SCANDAL

27
00:05:49,601 --> 00:05:50,775
Are you sure you're okay?

28
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,961
Yes. This isn't fatal.

29
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:11,763
Samaniego, isn't it?

30
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,231
So this is their hideout.

31
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,816
We were too late.

32
00:06:15,682 --> 00:06:16,626
Who is that?

33
00:06:16,651 --> 00:06:17,986
Ricky Adtoon.

34
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:20,322
Also known as "Joko."

35
00:06:21,665 --> 00:06:22,866
He has been wanted

36
00:06:23,486 --> 00:06:26,119
for murder, homicide, robbery,

37
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:28,455
gun-running, and illegal drugs.

38
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,265
He should've tried
raping to complete his list.

39
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:32,850
Hey! You listen first.

40
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,936
He was the hitman of the Samaniego group.

41
00:06:35,524 --> 00:06:36,567
And lastly,

42
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:41,984
they are the team behind the ambush
of human rights lawyer Michael Gallardo.

43
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:48,975
Gallardo's bodyguard said that
he was able to shoot one of the gunmen.

44
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,686
Based on what we saw a while ago,

45
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,189
Joko was shot in the back.

46
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:58,042
Is it safe to assume that he was
the gunman who shot the lawyer?

47
00:06:58,796 --> 00:06:59,555
Yes.

48
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,862
As well as the ones you encountered with?

49
00:07:00,901 --> 00:07:01,963
The Samaniego.

50
00:07:02,632 --> 00:07:04,866
We weren't able to
catch all of them last time.

51
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,111
But since I was able to shoot one of them,

52
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,955
their movement is now limited.

53
00:07:10,621 --> 00:07:13,166
That's why we need to act fast.

54
00:07:13,638 --> 00:07:15,977
We were able to collect fingerprints
at the crime scene.

55
00:07:16,331 --> 00:07:18,922
We're just waiting for
the results from the crime lab.

56
00:07:19,855 --> 00:07:22,092
We need to mobilize our agents,

57
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:24,894
so we can find their hideout.

58
00:07:25,085 --> 00:07:26,513
And then we attack.

59
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,850
We're getting close to solving this case.

60
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,204
Good job, everyone.

61
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,246
There you go!

62
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,024
Nice one!

63
00:07:39,197 --> 00:07:40,161
Meeting adjourned!

64
00:07:42,974 --> 00:07:46,019
Inform your agents ahead.
They might have more information.

65
00:07:46,254 --> 00:07:47,133
Yes, ma'am.

66
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:52,597
- Our agents are having booze right now!
- Perfect timing!

67
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:53,639
I think we should celebrate with them!

68
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,958
Our case is not yet closed.

69
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,645
But Patricia, we all need a break.

70
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:03,174
You know, just some booze
and some chit-chat.

71
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,401
Fine, go ahead. I can't join you, though.

72
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,487
But you're supposed to buy us some drinks!

73
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,613
You can manage.

74
00:08:09,445 --> 00:08:10,631
Let's go, boys!

75
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,225
Let's get wasted!

76
00:08:14,697 --> 00:08:15,854
So, I heard you got shot.

77
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,981
Good thing I was wearing a vest.

78
00:08:18,484 --> 00:08:20,317
Be careful next time.

79
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:21,985
I am always careful,

80
00:08:22,462 --> 00:08:23,296
chief.

81
00:08:25,937 --> 00:08:27,532
I'll go ahead.

82
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,484
LET'S MEET NOW.
I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU.

83
00:09:01,086 --> 00:09:02,292
Em?

84
00:09:04,421 --> 00:09:05,923
- Dear...
- Mom...

85
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,657
Your Uncle Joel and I will go ahead.

86
00:09:09,819 --> 00:09:11,368
Are you sure you're okay being alone?

87
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:15,513
I already cooked some food.
It will last you until tomorrow.

88
00:09:15,671 --> 00:09:18,124
Just call me if you need anything, okay?

89
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,102
Yes, Mom.

90
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:29,719
Go ahead. Your husband might be waiting.

91
00:09:33,262 --> 00:09:34,140
Alright.

92
00:09:36,218 --> 00:09:37,227
We'll go ahead.

93
00:09:46,856 --> 00:09:50,943

The prodigal daughter has returned.

99
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:08,844
You're such a show off!

100
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,445
Happy birthday, Mom! I love you!

101
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,139
Happy birthday!

102
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:15,865
Happy birthday, ma'am!

103
00:10:16,632 --> 00:10:17,325
One more time!

104
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,768

Let's eat. Oh, wait!
Let's take a picture first.

111
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,936
Go, go, go!

112
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,090
Smile!

113
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:51,843
Ready?

114
00:10:52,689 --> 00:10:53,398
Smile!

115
00:10:53,423 --> 00:10:55,472
Another one. Wacky!

116
00:10:56,955 --> 00:10:59,017
One more, jump shot!

117
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,773
Okay, let's eat!

118
00:11:05,182 --> 00:11:07,734
The food looks delicious!

119
00:11:08,022 --> 00:11:09,378
We have a lot!

120
00:11:09,622 --> 00:11:11,070
I'm hungry.

121
00:11:11,558 --> 00:11:13,198
Yummy. Let's dig in!

122
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,204
These look so good!

123
00:11:20,397 --> 00:11:22,207
Let's open the rest.

124
00:11:22,496 --> 00:11:25,284
Here are the chopsticks, ma'am.

125
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,544
Here's the salad.

126
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:47,357
Let's go.

127
00:11:48,772 --> 00:11:49,834
Where's Em?

128
00:11:50,094 --> 00:11:51,903
She doesn't want to join.

129
00:11:54,064 --> 00:11:56,241
Did she say anything?

130
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,635
I'll just wait till she's ready to open up.
I don't want to pressure her.

131
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:02,205
She might distance herself more
if I do, so let's go.

132
00:12:03,018 --> 00:12:03,790
Alright.

133
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,366
LET'S MEET NOW.
I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU.

134
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:27,121
OKAY. LET'S MEET UP LATER.

135
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:40,285
My mom is so gorgeous.

136
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,413
You're looking fresh now.

137
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:48,751
You're so gorgeous.

138
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,837
You're really beautiful.

139
00:12:53,859 --> 00:12:54,818
Let's lie down.

140
00:12:55,389 --> 00:12:56,676
There you go.

141
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,394
I had a long day today, Mom.

142
00:13:07,345 --> 00:13:09,022
We had an operation.

143
00:13:09,723 --> 00:13:12,901
Good thing I was safe.

144
00:13:13,565 --> 00:13:15,278
You're always on my mind.

145
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:18,698
I know you're always praying for my safety.

146
00:13:18,844 --> 00:13:20,325
That's why I'm always safe.

147
00:13:21,777 --> 00:13:23,153
Happy birthday, Mom.

148
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,455
I love you!

149
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,836
You look stressed.

150
00:13:34,223 --> 00:13:35,632
I almost got killed.

151
00:13:36,185 --> 00:13:37,217
What?

152
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,720
Good thing I was wearing a vest.

153
00:13:42,931 --> 00:13:44,724
Oh my god, Patricia.

154
00:13:45,753 --> 00:13:48,286
You're always putting yourself at risk.

155
00:13:48,804 --> 00:13:50,188
It's part of my job.

156
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,441
But even so,

157
00:13:55,591 --> 00:13:57,278
you have to think about your mom.

158
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,491
I'm doing this for her and Dad.

159
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:05,954
I know.

160
00:14:06,522 --> 00:14:10,067
I know you're sensitive
when it comes to that life choice.

161
00:14:11,631 --> 00:14:12,961
But Patricia,

162
00:14:13,297 --> 00:14:14,879
I don't wanna lose you.

163
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,173
You're my best friend.

164
00:14:19,206 --> 00:14:20,677
And you're my sister.

165
00:14:23,518 --> 00:14:25,515
I'm sorry if I got you worried.

166
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:30,687
I promise to be more careful. Thank you.

167
00:14:32,429 --> 00:14:33,690
Why don't we go out?

168
00:14:33,968 --> 00:14:35,275
A girls' night out, perhaps?

169
00:14:36,737 --> 00:14:40,196
Your mom is asleep anyway,
and your helper is there to look after her.

170
00:14:40,592 --> 00:14:43,157
Come on! Let's celebrate your second life.

171
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,038
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

172
00:15:16,672 --> 00:15:18,359
Are you sure we're in the right place?

173
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:23,156
They only play old, mellow music here.
I wanna dance!

174
00:15:23,406 --> 00:15:26,492
Let's just chill, okay?
Besides, I'm too old for dance parties.

175
00:15:26,712 --> 00:15:28,511
And I still have work tomorrow,

176
00:15:28,901 --> 00:15:31,581
unlike you, a full-time housewife.

177
00:15:34,203 --> 00:15:37,628
You thought I won't get your sarcasm?

178
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,776
Oh my god!

179
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:44,819
Why?

180
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:49,724
Look who's here.
Lorenzo, your ex-boyfriend.

181
00:15:50,494 --> 00:15:51,659
What do we drink?

182
00:15:52,581 --> 00:15:53,661
Shit.

183
00:15:54,098 --> 00:15:55,396
Do you wanna go somewhere else?

184
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:59,904
No. He might think I'm still not over him.

185
00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:02,306
Look, your ex-girlfriend.

186
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,364
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

187
00:16:32,887 --> 00:16:34,227
How's Stephen?

188
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:42,193
Strutting at work. He is planning to become
Chair of the justice committee.

189
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,903
I see.

190
00:16:45,175 --> 00:16:47,427
How about your relationship?
How is it going?

191
00:16:48,337 --> 00:16:51,048
Are you avoiding the topic of
your ex-boyfriend?

192
00:16:51,812 --> 00:16:53,287
No, I'm not.

193
00:16:54,155 --> 00:16:57,625
Besides, I've already moved on.

194
00:16:58,488 --> 00:16:59,752
I'm concerned about you.

195
00:17:01,616 --> 00:17:02,922
How long has it been?

196
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,341
It's been two years since your son died,

197
00:17:06,332 --> 00:17:10,377
but it seems like your husband
is becoming colder towards you.

198
00:17:12,144 --> 00:17:14,355
Why do I feel like you're interrogating me?

199
00:17:15,476 --> 00:17:16,352
Not really.

200
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,188
I just want an honest answer.

201
00:17:20,268 --> 00:17:21,811
You want an honest answer?

202
00:17:23,213 --> 00:17:25,966
My pussy badly needs some pumping.

203
00:17:26,954 --> 00:17:28,906
It's been dry for so long.

204
00:17:29,756 --> 00:17:31,033
Satisfied?

205
00:17:31,678 --> 00:17:32,888
Does he have a mistress?

206
00:17:57,758 --> 00:17:58,619
I don't know.

207
00:18:01,902 --> 00:18:03,779
I don't know anything.

208
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:05,693
So what's the problem?

209
00:18:06,282 --> 00:18:09,828
I have no idea.
We don't talk that much anymore.

210
00:18:10,526 --> 00:18:12,241
Maybe he doesn't love you anymore.

211
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,913
Fuck off, Patricia. Watch your words.

212
00:18:18,016 --> 00:18:19,684
Because if he really loves you,

213
00:18:20,672 --> 00:18:22,001
he'll make love to you.

214
00:18:22,564 --> 00:18:24,212
But I still love him.

215
00:18:25,197 --> 00:18:26,255
Yes, you do.

216
00:18:27,118 --> 00:18:28,132
But does he feel the same?

217
00:19:13,304 --> 00:19:14,554
Talk to him.

218
00:19:15,649 --> 00:19:17,317
Ask him if he still loves you.

219
00:19:17,932 --> 00:19:21,144
If he doesn't, then leave.

220
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,997
I know how much you love him,

221
00:19:25,828 --> 00:19:29,207
but you shouldn't force yourself into
a one-sided relationship.

222
00:19:31,089 --> 00:19:32,590
You'll get burned out.

223
00:19:33,443 --> 00:19:35,199
Think about yourself.

224
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,712
Excuse me.

225
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:00,099
Two bottles of beer, please.

226
00:20:03,447 --> 00:20:04,395
Patricia.

227
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,935
I heard you're handling the Gallardo case.

228
00:20:16,363 --> 00:20:18,200
In case you're wondering,

229
00:20:19,587 --> 00:20:20,745
we're doing great.

230
00:20:22,043 --> 00:20:22,919
Wow!

231
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,641
Amazing!

232
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:27,368
You haven't changed.

233
00:20:27,765 --> 00:20:30,838
I didn't say anything bad.
Don't be presumptous.

234
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,423
Stop gaslighting me.

235
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,718
I know you so well, Lorenzo.

236
00:20:36,883 --> 00:20:40,139
I know when you're belittling me.

237
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,600
That's not what I meant, Pat.

238
00:20:44,267 --> 00:20:49,648
But you know the Gallardo case
won't progress under the PBI, right?

239
00:20:51,755 --> 00:20:54,654
We're close to solving the case.

240
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:58,527
You know I'm still the better interrogator.

241
00:21:01,283 --> 00:21:05,331
Had it been assigned to us,
we would've solved it in no time.

242
00:21:05,941 --> 00:21:07,317
You know, Lorenzo,

243
00:21:08,496 --> 00:21:11,003
I don't have time to argue with you.

244
00:21:12,249 --> 00:21:16,759
I know how big your insecurities
are towards the PBI.

245
00:21:18,013 --> 00:21:18,972
Really,

246
00:21:20,335 --> 00:21:21,294
Patricia?

247
00:21:25,565 --> 00:21:26,608
How about,

248
00:21:28,847 --> 00:21:29,939
we make a bet.

249
00:21:30,932 --> 00:21:34,402
For a one-night stand.
I know you missed me.

250
00:21:44,907 --> 00:21:45,908
Let's go home.

251
00:21:47,334 --> 00:21:49,517
That asshole just ruined my night.

252
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:50,501
Let's go.

253
00:21:58,903 --> 00:22:01,114
I have to go.
I still have a shoot tomorrow.

254
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,364
Trent...

255
00:22:05,281 --> 00:22:06,492
Can we talk first?

256
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:09,270
About what?

257
00:22:15,031 --> 00:22:16,241
I'm pregnant.

258
00:22:16,675 --> 00:22:17,920
Pregnant with whom?

259
00:22:18,415 --> 00:22:19,488
Are you nuts?

260
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,450
I'm pregnant with your child.

261
00:22:27,116 --> 00:22:28,414
Trent...

262
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,333
Let's talk things out.

263
00:22:33,726 --> 00:22:34,920
That's not mine.

264
00:22:37,644 --> 00:22:38,649
What now?

265
00:22:39,628 --> 00:22:40,676
You ran out of words?

266
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:42,871
You're unsure?

267
00:22:44,018 --> 00:22:45,848
That's what you get from sleeping around!

268
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:47,908
Jerk!

269
00:22:59,275 --> 00:23:01,071
Tell that to the guy who knocked you up.

270
00:23:01,468 --> 00:23:02,490
Don't bug me!

271
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:06,543
That's not my child.

272
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:10,667
Fine.

273
00:23:11,533 --> 00:23:13,584
Don't own up to it.

274
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:17,710
But don't expect me
to be private about this.

275
00:23:19,956 --> 00:23:21,717
I'll let the world know about your child.

276
00:23:22,607 --> 00:23:24,595
I'll ruin your love team.

277
00:23:25,455 --> 00:23:28,057
Let's see if your career
doesn't get cancelled.

278
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:35,830
Are you fucking with me?

279
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:38,776
Don't you dare do that.

280
00:23:39,511 --> 00:23:40,502
Why?

281
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,279
Are you afraid?

282
00:23:48,239 --> 00:23:49,323
Are you threatening me?

283
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:50,621
Let go of me!

284
00:23:54,597 --> 00:23:56,126
Go ahead. Do it.

285
00:24:02,883 --> 00:24:03,984
What the hell?!

286
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:04,927
Bastard!

287
00:24:04,952 --> 00:24:05,970
Stop it!

288
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,434
Trent!

289
00:24:47,965 --> 00:24:50,598
That asshole hasn't changed.

290
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:58,397
He still thinks he can treat me like that
just because I'm a woman.

291
00:25:01,571 --> 00:25:05,738
Good thing you're not together anymore.

292
00:25:07,166 --> 00:25:14,496
For sure he still can't accept that
your rank is higher than his.

293
00:26:32,154 --> 00:26:33,325
Are you okay, miss?

294
00:26:35,586 --> 00:26:36,453
Are you sure?

295
00:26:39,506 --> 00:26:40,557
I'm sorry.

296
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:08,168
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

297
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:14,132
DID YOU MEET UP WITH DAD IN CONGRESS?

298
00:27:17,076 --> 00:27:21,473
ARE YOU COMING HOME?

299
00:29:10,795 --> 00:29:12,526
Em... Dear...

300
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:14,278
Where is she?

301
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,239
Put this on the table.

302
00:29:17,542 --> 00:29:18,365
Sure.

303
00:29:19,085 --> 00:29:20,033
Em...

304
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:21,702
Dear...

305
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:28,876
Em?

306
00:29:29,604 --> 00:29:32,254
Please prepare some stew for lunch.

307
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,590
Dear?

308
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,318
The food you cooked last night
is still there.

309
00:29:38,446 --> 00:29:40,781
She skipped her meals again.

310
00:29:41,733 --> 00:29:43,265
Em?!

311
00:29:45,512 --> 00:29:46,560
Dear?

312
00:29:49,941 --> 00:29:50,981
Dear...

313
00:29:52,446 --> 00:29:53,489
Em...

314
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,423
Dear...

315
00:29:55,819 --> 00:29:56,862
Are you there?

316
00:29:58,812 --> 00:29:59,979
Em...

317
00:30:01,943 --> 00:30:03,028
Em?

318
00:30:04,173 --> 00:30:05,383
Quick! Get a hammer!

319
00:30:05,408 --> 00:30:06,493
Huh? What for?

320
00:30:06,518 --> 00:30:07,769
Just go and get it!

321
00:30:08,009 --> 00:30:08,968
Em!

322
00:30:10,762 --> 00:30:11,763
Mom.

323
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:16,548
Why do you have to lock your door?

324
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,043
Because I'm sleeping.

325
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:42,407
Pat! The police are trying
to hijack the Gallardo case!

326
00:30:42,792 --> 00:30:43,951
Bullshit!

327
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:45,891
There they are.

328
00:30:48,961 --> 00:30:49,915
Hi, Pat!

329
00:30:53,609 --> 00:30:55,087
Don't you dare call me Pat!

330
00:30:58,319 --> 00:30:59,862
We worked hard on that case,

331
00:31:00,687 --> 00:31:02,022
so don't horn in on it.

332
00:31:02,047 --> 00:31:05,592
I'm just following orders.

333
00:31:05,918 --> 00:31:07,641
Stop fooling around, Lorenzo.

334
00:31:08,636 --> 00:31:12,980
That's why you were fishing for information
the last time, so you could take over.

335
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:16,775
You're taking things too personally, Pat.

336
00:31:17,651 --> 00:31:20,070
We're just following orders,

337
00:31:20,742 --> 00:31:21,697
don't you understand?

338
00:31:22,054 --> 00:31:25,683
Take over the case and you're dead.

339
00:31:26,475 --> 00:31:28,704
Pat Esguerra, the chief is looking for you.

340
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,003
Oh, you're being called to the office.

341
00:31:40,958 --> 00:31:42,501
Your boss needs you.

342
00:31:47,542 --> 00:31:49,683
Did you really think that I'd kill myself?

343
00:31:50,147 --> 00:31:51,518
I really thought you would.

344
00:31:52,165 --> 00:31:53,208
Mom, I won't.

345
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:55,897
I will never do that.

346
00:31:56,749 --> 00:32:00,944
Dear, if you need someone to talk to,
I'm just here for you.

347
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:03,616
Your Uncle Joel and I
are here for you, okay?

348
00:32:14,385 --> 00:32:16,251
I'm going back to work, Mom.

349
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:19,562
And I'll start vlogging again.

350
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:20,730
Are you sure?

351
00:32:21,457 --> 00:32:23,342
Is that what you really want?

352
00:32:24,538 --> 00:32:26,123
I need to do this, Mom.

353
00:32:26,783 --> 00:32:31,099
I need to make my presence felt
so the public won't forget me.

354
00:32:45,474 --> 00:32:47,366
Chief, we're close to catching
the Samaniego gang.

355
00:32:48,687 --> 00:32:52,024
I know you feel frustrated about it,
but I'm just folllowing orders from above.

356
00:32:52,527 --> 00:32:53,444
From above?

357
00:32:53,651 --> 00:32:55,540
They want to take over the case.

358
00:32:55,647 --> 00:32:56,541
Why?

359
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,628
The family members
want to speed up the case.

360
00:32:59,899 --> 00:33:02,402
Are they concerned?
Or they just want to impress?

361
00:33:04,169 --> 00:33:06,093
I feel your frustration,

362
00:33:07,321 --> 00:33:11,075
but whatever their reasons are,
we need to obey them.

363
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,641
Chief,

364
00:33:13,336 --> 00:33:15,005
we are doing everything we can.

365
00:33:15,496 --> 00:33:17,062
I almost died because of it!

366
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:22,859
That's how politics works.

367
00:33:23,928 --> 00:33:25,846
Just learn to roll with it.

368
00:33:26,722 --> 00:33:27,932
That's it?

369
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:31,493
We worked our assess off for it
but another team will get rewarded?

370
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:35,831
If only I could help you,
but this is already out of my control.

371
00:33:36,486 --> 00:33:40,335
So I'm sorry, Patricia,
but we need to let go of this case.

372
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:02,043
Hello, everyone! Hello, Em-nation!

373
00:34:02,068 --> 00:34:07,379
Your bubbly Em is back, stronger than ever!

374
00:34:07,404 --> 00:34:12,008
Thanks for your support, Jason!
He's watching right now.

375
00:34:12,033 --> 00:34:15,762
We have a lot of surprises
in the coming days!

376
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:17,681
And it's a big surprise!

377
00:34:18,321 --> 00:34:21,908
So to Em-nation, just keep in touch!

378
00:34:29,796 --> 00:34:31,089
Load them in.

379
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,151
Pat.

380
00:34:48,513 --> 00:34:49,946
No hard feelings, okay?

381
00:34:50,158 --> 00:34:51,534
You know how the system works.

382
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:57,454
If you want, we can just
push through with our bet.

383
00:35:20,149 --> 00:35:23,230
Baby girl, what are you reading?

384
00:35:27,369 --> 00:35:32,364
It seems like you're into
reading crime stories.

385
00:35:32,633 --> 00:35:34,924
Yes, because I want to be like you, Dad.

386
00:36:18,766 --> 00:36:22,305
Don't forget my reminders, okay?

387
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:25,000
You should eat a lot.
You look frail already.

388
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,217
Are you gonna be okay?

389
00:36:29,563 --> 00:36:33,150
Dear, I'm glad that
you're taking control of your life.

390
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,360
Don't let negativity affect you.

391
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,071
Stay strong
because we're always here for you, okay?

392
00:36:39,323 --> 00:36:41,349
Everything will be okay.

393
00:36:41,742 --> 00:36:43,518
- Thank you, Mom.
- Okay.

394
00:36:43,722 --> 00:36:44,769
We'll go ahead.

395
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:47,706
Mom...

396
00:36:52,327 --> 00:36:53,494
I love you.

397
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:55,964
I love you, Em.

398
00:37:30,407 --> 00:37:33,401
That's it? Is this just about politics?

399
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:35,253
Fuck this shit!

400
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:40,659
Bacolod, turn up the volume.

401
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:46,420
We already have persons of interest
in the murder of Attorney Gallardo.

402
00:37:46,853 --> 00:37:50,857
We raided their hideout and we found
the dead body of one of the suspects.

403
00:37:50,952 --> 00:37:52,204
It wasn't you who found it, fuckers!

404
00:37:52,229 --> 00:37:54,839
We did all the work
and they got all the praises.

405
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,636
We're still identifying the other suspects,

406
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:01,888
and soon, we'll be able
to catch all of them.

407
00:38:27,757 --> 00:38:28,598
Hello?

408
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:29,766
Are you blackmailing me?

409
00:38:30,496 --> 00:38:31,309
Why?

410
00:38:32,057 --> 00:38:33,561
Are you threatened?

411
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:34,979
How much do you want?

412
00:38:35,935 --> 00:38:37,645
One million pesos? Two million?

413
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:40,985
Trent! This isn't just about you.

414
00:38:41,121 --> 00:38:43,221
Then what the fuck is this all about?

415
00:38:46,321 --> 00:38:47,364
You know what,

416
00:38:48,649 --> 00:38:49,609
I'm sorry.

417
00:38:50,735 --> 00:38:53,112
But I'm taking control of my life now.

418
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:57,752
Please, Em, don't do this to me. Please.

419
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:00,964
It will damage my reputation.

420
00:39:01,286 --> 00:39:02,741
I will lose my career.

421
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,218
You made me do it.

422
00:39:05,877 --> 00:39:07,387
Fine, fucker!

423
00:39:07,857 --> 00:39:09,038
Do as you wish!

424
00:39:10,144 --> 00:39:11,666
But I'll make sure

425
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:14,978
that you'll regret--

426
00:39:38,733 --> 00:39:39,794
Trent...

427
00:39:41,952 --> 00:39:42,839
Ara...

428
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:44,591
What are you doing here?

429
00:39:46,673 --> 00:39:48,328
Nothing. Just getting some fresh air.

430
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,163
Is there something wrong?

431
00:39:50,865 --> 00:39:52,457
You looked stressed.

432
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:59,022
Do you want to destress?

433
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:05,136
I'm sorry, Ara.

434
00:40:06,546 --> 00:40:07,797
I'm not in the mood.

435
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,437
Let's go. I'll book you a ride home.

436
00:40:24,334 --> 00:40:25,376
What is this about?

437
00:40:26,246 --> 00:40:28,117
I just want to air my side.

438
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,120
Why don't you do it in front of the team?

439
00:40:31,564 --> 00:40:33,316
But you wouldn't let me.

440
00:40:36,191 --> 00:40:38,694
I know how important
the Gallardo case is to you.

441
00:40:40,597 --> 00:40:41,965
Then why did you give it up?

442
00:40:42,984 --> 00:40:46,261
The Samaniego was the last case
that my dad handled.

443
00:40:47,364 --> 00:40:48,930
It's personal to me.

444
00:40:50,484 --> 00:40:53,362
And that's precisely the reason
why I gave it to another team.

445
00:40:54,665 --> 00:40:56,079
I'll be honest with you--

446
00:40:56,289 --> 00:41:01,442
I had doubts if you can handle the case
when I learned the Samaniego was involved.

447
00:41:01,943 --> 00:41:07,323
Chief, I am doing everything
to solve the case.

448
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:10,285
But until when?

449
00:41:12,172 --> 00:41:14,597
Sooner or later, you won't
be able to think objectively

450
00:41:14,621 --> 00:41:16,677
because you're already
too obsessed with it.

451
00:41:17,726 --> 00:41:19,978
And then your emotions
will get the better of you.

452
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,397
You're jumping to conclusions.

453
00:41:24,877 --> 00:41:27,468
Do you think I will let
my emotions cloud my judgement

454
00:41:28,113 --> 00:41:30,096
because I'm a woman?

455
00:41:31,448 --> 00:41:34,726
Fuck that! Fuck your misogynistic views!

456
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:39,564
And you think I care about
your feminist ideology?

457
00:41:40,928 --> 00:41:42,096
That's bullshit.

458
00:41:44,027 --> 00:41:46,905
Our institution was built by strong men.

459
00:41:48,048 --> 00:41:49,132
Do you understand?

460
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:51,200
Just deal with it.

461
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,244
It's for your own good.

462
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:56,414
You may remove me from the case,

463
00:41:57,228 --> 00:41:59,709
but spare the rest of the team.

464
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:01,836
They worked hard on it.

465
00:42:02,275 --> 00:42:05,506
They don't deserve this. Don't be unfair!

466
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:09,385
You should take it easy, Patricia.

467
00:42:10,457 --> 00:42:12,805
You'll grow old alone
if you continue acting like that.

468
00:42:13,637 --> 00:42:15,183
What a waste.

469
00:45:52,098 --> 00:45:54,293
I heard you are handling the case
of the infamous vlogger.

470
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:56,837
It fits you, all for show.

471
00:45:56,862 --> 00:46:00,716
Carabao grass, I found this
at the Celera farmhouse.

472
00:46:00,741 --> 00:46:03,236
I found this number on Em's phonebook.

473
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:05,930
You were with Em a few hours
before she died.

474
00:46:06,061 --> 00:46:08,683
You have a girlfriend, am I right?

475
00:46:08,708 --> 00:46:09,850
Her name is Arabella.

476
00:46:09,851 --> 00:46:11,811
- Em is pregnant.
- And you're the father?

477
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:14,772
I don't know. But who knows?
It might be someone else's.

478
00:46:14,797 --> 00:46:16,883
Someone wants to talk to you.
