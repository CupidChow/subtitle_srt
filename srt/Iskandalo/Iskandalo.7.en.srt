1
00:00:02,695 --> 00:00:04,004
I am Stephen Chuatico.

2
00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:05,730
I did not expect you
to be this handsome.

3
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:06,940
I have something for you.

4
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:07,882
This is beautiful!

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:10,760
Calm down.

6
00:00:10,785 --> 00:00:12,988
I was just here,
loving you all along.

7
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,139
I was just here for you, too.

8
00:00:14,164 --> 00:00:15,098
I already told you to...

9
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,574
stay out of Em's funeral!

10
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:17,684
I need closure!

11
00:00:17,709 --> 00:00:20,412
A dead person can never give you closure!

12
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:23,398
Were you more than friends?

13
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:24,499
I courted her.

14
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:27,002
I didn't know you were into necklaces.

15
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,795
Who was hit hard when the scandal blew up?

16
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,796
Only Em, right?

17
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,172
Two of them died.

18
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,975
Em was pregnant when she was killed.

19
00:00:47,305 --> 00:00:48,740
They set me up.

20
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:51,426
Then let them know about it!

21
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,011
I already did...

22
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:54,263
but...

23
00:00:55,356 --> 00:00:56,832
they didn't believe me.

24
00:00:58,383 --> 00:01:00,519
My reputation as an agent is ruined.

25
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:06,817
I'm sure you know
who put your name on the matrix.

26
00:01:07,337 --> 00:01:09,511
Please tell them, Abel.

27
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:19,646
Carmen, I don't want to put you in danger.

28
00:01:26,004 --> 00:01:27,754
Everything will be okay.

29
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,316
For sure he was killed by the syndicate.

30
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:49,735
They wanted to silence him.

31
00:01:49,835 --> 00:01:51,695
Isn't it a suicide murder case?

32
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,364
I don't think so.
Sir Abel was lefthanded...

33
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:55,824
and all of his gunshots
were on the right side.

34
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,455
Only his wife can tell us
what really happened.

35
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:04,625
How’s her mom?

36
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,752
She's still in critical condition.

37
00:02:17,415 --> 00:02:18,305
It's him!

38
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,222
It's him!

39
00:02:20,077 --> 00:02:20,891
It's him!

40
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,076
- He killed my dad!
- Ma'am!

41
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:26,104
- He's the one who killed my dad!
- Ma'am, he's part of our team.

42
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:27,481
It's him!

43
00:02:27,506 --> 00:02:30,083
Please calm down, ma'am.

44
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:34,279
How dare you!

45
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:37,741
Just relax, ma'am. He's our co-agent.

46
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:41,035
You should
take a rest first, ma'am.

47
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,789
Get some rest, ma'am.

48
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:34,566
Yes, Stephen?

49
00:04:34,765 --> 00:04:36,109
Why did you keep that information?

50
00:04:37,266 --> 00:04:38,970
Mrs. Celera told us to.

51
00:04:39,724 --> 00:04:40,947
If you're having doubts,

52
00:04:41,752 --> 00:04:44,326
I can show you the autopsy report.

53
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:46,828
Em was three months pregnant.

54
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,457
Was she pregnant with--

55
00:04:50,535 --> 00:04:51,583
Trent?

56
00:04:53,134 --> 00:04:54,052
No.

57
00:04:54,103 --> 00:04:55,253
He denies it.

58
00:04:55,756 --> 00:04:58,423
He said the father
was the guy in the sex scandal.

59
00:05:04,261 --> 00:05:05,388
Are you okay?

60
00:05:08,586 --> 00:05:10,560
You might have
some information about the guy.

61
00:05:22,973 --> 00:05:23,891
Patricia...

62
00:05:26,268 --> 00:05:27,352
Let's talk.

63
00:06:03,253 --> 00:06:04,322
Who's there?

64
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,365
It's me.

65
00:06:06,776 --> 00:06:07,819
Are you alone?

66
00:06:07,844 --> 00:06:08,685
Yes.

67
00:06:10,784 --> 00:06:12,539
Hey, what's wrong?

68
00:06:14,188 --> 00:06:15,275
Put that down.

69
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:25,169
- If this is about--
- We already talked, Agent Esguerra!

70
00:06:25,194 --> 00:06:27,971
I told you to keep
Em's pregnancy a secret!

71
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,891
I was just looking for sympathy.

72
00:06:30,971 --> 00:06:33,602
By disrespecting
the request of the family?

73
00:06:35,183 --> 00:06:37,647
I just did what I thought
would help the case.

74
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:41,109
In what way?

75
00:06:41,598 --> 00:06:43,111
If the suspect finds out,

76
00:06:44,233 --> 00:06:46,865
he might feel guilty
that he killed an innocent child.

77
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,540
And how do you think
the public would take the revelation?

78
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,970
For sure they are wondering if
Trent was the father...

79
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,247
or if it's the guy
in the sex scandal.

80
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,692
Can't we spare my daughter
from all of these issues?

81
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:00,754
She was already laid to rest
but the issues...

82
00:07:01,149 --> 00:07:02,839
keep on hounding her.

83
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:06,843
You didn't get any sympathy
from what you did, Agent Esguerra.

84
00:07:07,113 --> 00:07:09,804
You just opened another can of worms!

85
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:12,932
You should've thought hard about it first.

86
00:07:12,957 --> 00:07:14,809
Can we still retract
what she said?

87
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:16,060
Unfortunately, Mrs. Elaine,

88
00:07:16,085 --> 00:07:19,189
we'd look like liars if we do that.

89
00:07:20,184 --> 00:07:22,651
I'll talk to Stephen about this.

90
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,903
Mrs. Celera...

91
00:07:26,622 --> 00:07:28,198
What the hell are you doing here?

92
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,492
Checking up on you.
Why, am I not allowed to?

93
00:07:31,352 --> 00:07:32,145
Why?

94
00:07:32,353 --> 00:07:34,564
Are you afraid to lose
the two-million-cash reward?

95
00:07:34,713 --> 00:07:37,132
Is that why you're here?

96
00:07:37,483 --> 00:07:38,776
To secure the reward?

97
00:07:38,948 --> 00:07:40,408
Watch it, Agatha.

98
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:41,504
That's just money.

99
00:07:41,576 --> 00:07:43,161
I won't betray you for that.

100
00:07:43,323 --> 00:07:44,255
Moron!

101
00:07:44,394 --> 00:07:46,521
Relationships are useless
when money is on the line.

102
00:07:46,576 --> 00:07:47,509
Do you think so?

103
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:50,787
You killed Em Celera, didn't you?

104
00:07:54,923 --> 00:07:56,167
I love her.

105
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,480
I cannot do that to her.

106
00:07:59,505 --> 00:08:00,647
But you know what, Agatha,

107
00:08:01,152 --> 00:08:04,025
sometimes we do stupid things for love.

108
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:07,113
I don't feel safe here anymore.

109
00:08:07,138 --> 00:08:09,349
I need to look for a new hideout.

110
00:08:09,374 --> 00:08:11,126
- I'll help you--
- Don't come near me!

111
00:08:11,984 --> 00:08:13,018
Stay away.

112
00:08:13,603 --> 00:08:14,520
Agatha...

113
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,621
Get away from me.

114
00:08:17,065 --> 00:08:17,982
I'll help you.

115
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:24,279
Don't follow me or else I'll kill you!

116
00:08:28,977 --> 00:08:29,892
Agatha...

117
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:31,594
What the hell is wrong with her?

118
00:08:33,414 --> 00:08:34,623
Bullshit!

119
00:08:38,836 --> 00:08:41,296
That was a stupid and reckless move.

120
00:08:46,328 --> 00:08:47,861
What do you want to happen?

121
00:08:49,594 --> 00:08:51,614
I'm going to be straight with you, sir.

122
00:08:51,794 --> 00:08:54,171
What if Congressman Chuatico...

123
00:08:54,196 --> 00:08:55,785
is the mastermind behind Em's murder?

124
00:08:58,664 --> 00:08:59,832
And what is your proof?

125
00:08:59,912 --> 00:09:01,791
He is the guy in the sex scandal.

126
00:09:03,127 --> 00:09:05,020
Agatha is our suspect!

127
00:09:05,155 --> 00:09:06,699
What if it isn't Agatha?

128
00:09:06,724 --> 00:09:07,839
So be it!

129
00:09:08,803 --> 00:09:12,719
We give justice to the family,
not the truth.

130
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:15,181
There is no justice without truth!

131
00:09:15,206 --> 00:09:17,474
You're too idealistic!

132
00:09:17,917 --> 00:09:19,809
Your views will still change.

133
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:23,856
If the family believes...

134
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:26,357
it's Agatha, then she's our suspect.

135
00:09:26,756 --> 00:09:29,803
Justice and truth
are mutually exclusive.

136
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:32,989
For some, justice is when
someone gets jailed.

137
00:09:33,683 --> 00:09:37,727
It doesn't matter if
the person is guilty or not.

138
00:09:39,522 --> 00:09:41,983
I'm tired of cleaning up your mess.

139
00:09:42,689 --> 00:09:44,918
I'm removing you from Em Celera's case.

140
00:09:45,213 --> 00:09:46,653
Effective immediately.

141
00:09:47,251 --> 00:09:50,298
- You can't do this to me, chief.
- I'm sorry, Patricia, but...

142
00:09:50,536 --> 00:09:53,301
I'll be personally taking
charge of this case.

143
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:29,003
I cooked lunch for us. Let's eat?

144
00:10:30,651 --> 00:10:31,589
I'm tired.

145
00:10:33,284 --> 00:10:34,384
But honey...

146
00:10:47,173 --> 00:10:49,632
Hey, your statement is trending.

147
00:10:50,926 --> 00:10:52,861
Philip just removed me from the case.

148
00:10:54,227 --> 00:10:55,138
What now?

149
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,809
Mrs. Celera was fuming.

150
00:11:01,085 --> 00:11:02,520
What's going to happen now?

151
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:05,815
Philip will lead your team.

152
00:11:06,442 --> 00:11:09,294
I got the reaction that
I wanted from Chuatico.

153
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,837
Was it worth it?

154
00:11:11,439 --> 00:11:12,463
Of course.

155
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,466
I wouldn't gamble if it wasn't.

156
00:11:15,868 --> 00:11:17,994
What else do you expect from Chuatico?

157
00:11:20,122 --> 00:11:21,931
His son died a few years ago.

158
00:11:22,763 --> 00:11:25,185
I'm sure he wouldn't want
that to happen again.

159
00:11:25,498 --> 00:11:27,353
So if he's the mastermind
behind Em's murder,

160
00:11:29,134 --> 00:11:30,726
then for sure, he'll surrender.

161
00:12:33,054 --> 00:12:35,129
Em was pregnant
when she was killed.

162
00:12:37,867 --> 00:12:40,260
- Was she pregnant with--
- Trent?

163
00:12:41,857 --> 00:12:42,762
No.

164
00:12:43,328 --> 00:12:44,555
He denies it.

165
00:12:46,334 --> 00:12:49,085
He said the father
was the guy in the sex scandal.

166
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:15,795
Psychological warfare.

167
00:13:16,238 --> 00:13:18,131
I had to do what I have to do.

168
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:20,116
For truth.

169
00:13:22,956 --> 00:13:23,991
What's going to happen to me?

170
00:13:24,335 --> 00:13:26,556
You're good. Philip will keep you.

171
00:13:27,942 --> 00:13:29,042
Did you hear that?

172
00:13:30,336 --> 00:13:32,254
But I have a favor to ask of you.

173
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:34,056
What is it?

174
00:13:35,466 --> 00:13:37,233
I want you to report to me everything

175
00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:38,719
in this case.

176
00:13:38,964 --> 00:13:40,987
Tell me everything
that's going to happen.

177
00:13:42,181 --> 00:13:43,139
Is that all?

178
00:13:43,704 --> 00:13:44,824
No problem!

179
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:46,894
Thank you.

180
00:13:58,823 --> 00:14:02,283
Em was pregnant?

181
00:15:17,822 --> 00:15:19,740
Do you want to extend
our stay in Switzerland?

182
00:15:19,765 --> 00:15:22,004
I feel like five days isn't enough.

183
00:15:22,539 --> 00:15:23,506
What?

184
00:15:23,988 --> 00:15:25,575
Can you just reschedule it?

185
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:28,636
I'm still busy with Em's case.

186
00:15:28,863 --> 00:15:30,155
Fuck it, Stephen!

187
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,306
I've been waiting for this

188
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:35,000
and you'll just choose that case over it?

189
00:15:35,523 --> 00:15:37,103
You know that it's part of my job, right?

190
00:15:37,489 --> 00:15:38,406
For real?

191
00:15:38,756 --> 00:15:39,756
Your job?

192
00:15:40,841 --> 00:15:42,717
Do you think I don't know the truth?

193
00:15:43,586 --> 00:15:44,587
What do you know?

194
00:15:45,429 --> 00:15:47,405
You two were having an affair!

195
00:15:47,854 --> 00:15:50,032
But I never confronted you about it.

196
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:54,228
I didn't want to play the villain.

197
00:15:55,262 --> 00:15:57,373
So I tolerated it.

198
00:15:59,597 --> 00:16:03,087
I was even willing to share you with her,
as long you were happy.

199
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:06,383
I was thinking that maybe
it was just a phase in your life.

200
00:16:06,408 --> 00:16:09,469
Perhaps, it was your way
of coping with the death of our son.

201
00:16:10,746 --> 00:16:12,889
That's why you found another way...

202
00:16:13,801 --> 00:16:16,559
to be happy, and that was Em.

203
00:16:17,948 --> 00:16:19,478
But Stephen,

204
00:16:21,392 --> 00:16:23,524
she's already dead.

205
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,761
Em is gone.

206
00:16:27,513 --> 00:16:30,239
Come on, come back to me.

207
00:16:33,224 --> 00:16:34,435
I love Em.

208
00:16:35,521 --> 00:16:37,438
Do you love her more than me?

209
00:16:42,695 --> 00:16:44,028
I'm sorry, Belinda,

210
00:16:46,329 --> 00:16:48,116
but I don't love you anymore.

211
00:16:49,702 --> 00:16:52,829
I can only feel sadness when I'm with you.

212
00:16:55,752 --> 00:16:57,517
I'm not happy with you anymore.

213
00:16:59,412 --> 00:17:00,503
Hon...

214
00:17:06,654 --> 00:17:08,261
Damn you, Stephen.

215
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,473
I've been a good wife to you.

216
00:17:13,948 --> 00:17:16,285
If you can cheat,

217
00:17:17,641 --> 00:17:19,021
so can I.

218
00:17:22,525 --> 00:17:25,754
The cops that were supposed
to serve a warrant of arrest...

219
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:29,425
to the Samaniego group
were ambushed in Cabitan, Aurora.

220
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:33,135
Police Major Lorenzo Abesamis...

221
00:17:33,307 --> 00:17:37,415
along with 15 other cops were killed.

222
00:17:39,716 --> 00:17:40,668
Shit...

223
00:17:46,592 --> 00:17:48,968
Miss, may I join you?

224
00:17:51,597 --> 00:17:55,935
I'm sorry, but I don't have
time to flirt around.

225
00:17:57,978 --> 00:17:58,953
She's a snob!

226
00:17:59,907 --> 00:18:01,272
- Really?
- Your turn.

227
00:18:05,914 --> 00:18:06,903
Miss...

228
00:18:08,774 --> 00:18:10,798
Why are you embarrassing my friend?

229
00:18:13,283 --> 00:18:14,635
What do you want me to do?

230
00:18:14,912 --> 00:18:15,996
Apologize to him?

231
00:18:17,206 --> 00:18:21,809
I'm sorry, but I don't
apologize to assholes.

232
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,675
What are you waiting for?

233
00:19:12,981 --> 00:19:14,111
Take off your shirt.

234
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,710
What's the rush?

235
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,743
Hold on. Here it comes.

236
00:21:15,493 --> 00:21:16,426
Who are you?

237
00:23:15,632 --> 00:23:20,232
His handler was
trying to call him...

238
00:23:20,587 --> 00:23:22,656
but he wasn't answering.

239
00:23:22,681 --> 00:23:24,612
So she asked the security
to check on him.

240
00:23:25,914 --> 00:23:29,433
They kept on knocking on the door
but he wasn't responding.

241
00:23:29,563 --> 00:23:32,369
They forced the door open,

242
00:23:32,985 --> 00:23:34,522
and this is what they saw.

243
00:23:40,779 --> 00:23:42,738
What are you doing here, Agent Esguerra?

244
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:49,752
I'm just helping out, sir.

245
00:23:49,777 --> 00:23:50,763
What for?

246
00:23:51,248 --> 00:23:52,874
You're not needed here.

247
00:23:53,367 --> 00:23:54,977
With all due respect, sir,

248
00:23:55,002 --> 00:23:57,353
why am I not needed in this case?

249
00:23:57,771 --> 00:24:00,399
We can handle this. Just
wait for your next assignment.

250
00:24:00,424 --> 00:24:02,675
I started this case, sir,

251
00:24:03,612 --> 00:24:05,277
so I just want to continue with it.

252
00:24:05,721 --> 00:24:09,073
- We can manage.
- But sir, I'm already here.

253
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:11,951
Why don't you just wait
for your next assignment?

254
00:24:12,102 --> 00:24:14,812
- You may leave now.
- But I'm part of this case.

255
00:24:22,863 --> 00:24:24,448
Ma'am, you're not allowed in here.

256
00:24:24,473 --> 00:24:25,328
Let's go outside.

257
00:24:25,913 --> 00:24:27,174
Please, ma'am.

258
00:24:36,113 --> 00:24:37,042
Let's go there.

259
00:24:37,793 --> 00:24:38,559
It's okay.

260
00:24:47,262 --> 00:24:49,863
I'm so stupid. This is all my fault.

261
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,684
I shouldn't have left him alone.

262
00:24:55,854 --> 00:24:58,022
He wouldn't have died.

263
00:24:58,888 --> 00:25:01,917
He had been receiving death threats.

264
00:25:02,329 --> 00:25:03,403
Death threats?

265
00:25:05,906 --> 00:25:09,259
Last week, somebody left
a dead bird in his car

266
00:25:09,284 --> 00:25:12,094
and left a note that said,
"Be careful."

267
00:25:12,537 --> 00:25:14,722
Why didn't you report this to the police?

268
00:25:14,807 --> 00:25:16,475
Trent told me that...

269
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,335
it would just go out of hand
if we report it to the authorities.

270
00:25:21,755 --> 00:25:24,106
Because he knew
the person behind all of this.

271
00:25:28,248 --> 00:25:32,574
Actor and heartthrob Trent Martinez
was found dead this morning.

272
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:36,577
He was allegedly killed
inside his own condominium unit.

273
00:25:36,686 --> 00:25:41,023
Investigation is underway
to identify the suspect.

274
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:01,543
Where have you been?

275
00:26:05,434 --> 00:26:09,093
I just let off some steam.

276
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,821
What's wrong?

277
00:26:13,849 --> 00:26:15,949
You had a fight

278
00:26:16,268 --> 00:26:18,519
with your useless husband?

279
00:26:21,314 --> 00:26:23,165
Is this about the...

280
00:26:23,596 --> 00:26:25,109
dead starlet?

281
00:26:26,474 --> 00:26:28,378
Do you know anything about their affair?

282
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,322
Well, I heard rumors.

283
00:26:31,199 --> 00:26:33,133
You know how it is in the office:

284
00:26:33,201 --> 00:26:34,995
Rumormongers are everywhere,

285
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,622
waiting for the latest news.

286
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:48,565
Mr. Congressman...

287
00:26:49,687 --> 00:26:51,026
She didn't set an appointment.

288
00:26:52,512 --> 00:26:53,445
Let her be.

289
00:26:55,108 --> 00:26:57,391
What can I do for...

290
00:26:58,192 --> 00:27:00,444
my wife's hardworking best friend?

291
00:27:00,729 --> 00:27:02,813
Are you the mastermind
behind Trent's murder?

292
00:27:04,274 --> 00:27:06,525
He was found hanging in his unit.

293
00:27:08,275 --> 00:27:09,711
Did you order him killed?

294
00:27:11,865 --> 00:27:13,674
Stop fooling me, Stephen.

295
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:15,576
Trent confessed to me.

296
00:27:16,114 --> 00:27:17,928
After we set him free,

297
00:27:18,872 --> 00:27:20,305
you beat him up.

298
00:27:21,124 --> 00:27:22,683
You also...

299
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:26,628
threatened him during
Em's burial, am I right?

300
00:27:28,632 --> 00:27:30,116
And that thing you did to his car,

301
00:27:30,277 --> 00:27:31,717
can you explain it?

302
00:27:34,134 --> 00:27:37,781
I have so many reasons
to have you arrested.

303
00:27:39,142 --> 00:27:41,018
Did you kill Trent?

304
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:45,122
Patricia, I don't have
any reason to kill him.

305
00:27:45,836 --> 00:27:46,874
You do.

306
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,194
Trent knew that you're
the guy in the sex scandal.

307
00:27:55,981 --> 00:27:58,368
I thought you were
doing something about it?

308
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:01,388
You already know what to do, right?

309
00:28:01,951 --> 00:28:03,457
You are his wife...

310
00:28:04,918 --> 00:28:07,394
so you should be able to discipline him.

311
00:28:07,963 --> 00:28:08,812
Am I correct?

312
00:28:09,709 --> 00:28:10,881
Instead of just...

313
00:28:11,758 --> 00:28:18,864
accepting the love
that worthless man is giving you.

314
00:28:19,258 --> 00:28:20,949
Look at yourself.

315
00:28:21,518 --> 00:28:22,810
You turned into a weakling.

316
00:28:26,563 --> 00:28:28,040
And then...

317
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:30,751
you go crazy

318
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:32,878
when he is not around.

319
00:28:33,089 --> 00:28:34,171
Am I right?

320
00:28:37,106 --> 00:28:38,258
How about Em?

321
00:28:39,648 --> 00:28:41,328
Did you order her killed?

322
00:28:42,966 --> 00:28:44,790
I could never do that to her.

323
00:28:45,936 --> 00:28:47,251
Because you love her.

324
00:28:52,705 --> 00:28:58,679
If I find out that
you have them killed,

325
00:28:58,985 --> 00:29:00,764
I'll make sure to...

326
00:29:01,224 --> 00:29:02,641
put you in jail.

327
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:10,544
Go ahead.

328
00:29:12,757 --> 00:29:13,610
Do it.

329
00:29:15,184 --> 00:29:17,781
I know my conscience is clean.

330
00:29:33,673 --> 00:29:36,024
Em always insisted
that they were just friends.

331
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:37,693
until I saw her post online.

332
00:29:38,073 --> 00:29:39,695
She was wearing a necklace
with a half-heart pendant.

333
00:29:40,497 --> 00:29:43,031
She said she was looking
for the other half.

334
00:29:43,391 --> 00:29:45,909
And then when I watched
the congressman...

335
00:29:46,108 --> 00:29:47,035
on TV,

336
00:29:47,449 --> 00:29:49,413
I saw what he was wearing--

337
00:29:50,044 --> 00:29:51,456
the other half of the pendant.

338
00:29:56,772 --> 00:29:57,963
Belinda,

339
00:29:59,804 --> 00:30:02,492
you are a De Dios.

340
00:30:03,161 --> 00:30:06,663
You have such a powerful name.

341
00:30:07,957 --> 00:30:12,085
I didn't raise you to be a sore loser

342
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:16,423
and to be defeated by a dead starlet.

343
00:30:16,758 --> 00:30:19,092
You're better than her!

344
00:30:20,275 --> 00:30:23,153
You show that husband of yours...

345
00:30:23,181 --> 00:30:26,241
that you're on top of everything.

346
00:30:26,296 --> 00:30:28,410
If he hurts you,

347
00:30:29,588 --> 00:30:30,771
then fight back!

348
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:36,193
Don't let him get away with it!

349
00:30:39,193 --> 00:30:40,405
Do you understand?

350
00:30:43,937 --> 00:30:45,177
Yes, Papa.

351
00:30:47,706 --> 00:30:49,581
Papa loves you, that's why,

352
00:30:51,404 --> 00:30:52,225
okay?

353
00:31:04,681 --> 00:31:07,767
EM'S UNCENSORED SEX SCANDAL
HAS BEEN UPLOADED.

354
00:31:07,767 --> 00:31:10,061
CONGRESSMAN CHUATICO
IS THE GUY IN THE VIDEO.

355
00:31:53,772 --> 00:31:54,831
Congressman.

356
00:31:54,856 --> 00:31:56,873
The full unedited version

357
00:31:56,971 --> 00:32:00,001
of that scandal video of
Em Celera has been leaked.

358
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,380
This is a big scandal, Mr. Congressman.

359
00:32:04,324 --> 00:32:05,633
What I advise is we call...

360
00:32:05,658 --> 00:32:08,176
a press conference
and you deny everything.

361
00:32:14,501 --> 00:32:19,212
Okay. You may go now.
I want to be alone.

362
00:32:19,884 --> 00:32:20,922
Alright, sir.

363
00:33:01,865 --> 00:33:02,950
Choi...

364
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,566
It has gone viral.

365
00:33:05,093 --> 00:33:07,861
It blew up because of
Congressman Chuatico's involvement.

366
00:33:08,483 --> 00:33:09,946
Can you trace the source?

367
00:33:10,624 --> 00:33:14,326
We need to find out
the motive of the uploader.

368
00:33:14,566 --> 00:33:16,119
I'm on it.

369
00:33:16,487 --> 00:33:17,412
Good.

370
00:33:19,555 --> 00:33:20,499
See?

371
00:33:21,765 --> 00:33:23,735
Right here.

372
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,136
- I'll go ahead. Just update me.
- Alright.

373
00:33:39,711 --> 00:33:41,561
You're so stubborn, Patricia.

374
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:44,397
I already told you that
you're out of this case.

375
00:33:45,049 --> 00:33:46,525
Why won't you let me do it, sir?

376
00:33:47,427 --> 00:33:49,945
Because it's connected to Em's murder

377
00:33:50,305 --> 00:33:51,655
and we already have a suspect.

378
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,864
Look...

379
00:34:01,816 --> 00:34:02,916
Agatha David.

380
00:34:03,026 --> 00:34:04,027
Yes.

381
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:06,504
There might be a link between...

382
00:34:06,529 --> 00:34:08,797
Trent and Em's murder cases.

383
00:34:08,977 --> 00:34:11,758
But it's possible that
Agatha didn't kill Em.

384
00:34:11,865 --> 00:34:13,385
Here we go again.

385
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:17,430
Why do you keep on insisting
that Agatha is innocent?

386
00:34:18,641 --> 00:34:21,851
Because she is not trained
to do a Blake's Hitch.

387
00:34:21,982 --> 00:34:23,483
She doesn't have a background...

388
00:34:23,508 --> 00:34:25,647
in camping and mountaineering.

389
00:34:26,132 --> 00:34:28,067
She can't do that knot.

390
00:34:28,092 --> 00:34:29,761
What if she studied it on her own?

391
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:32,362
Online tutorials is a thing, anyway.

392
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,825
We already have a suspect, Patricia.

393
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:38,159
She has a motivation to kill Em.

394
00:34:41,439 --> 00:34:42,981
She is an obssessed fan.

395
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:45,875
And now she killed Trent.

396
00:34:46,261 --> 00:34:47,194
Why!?

397
00:34:48,107 --> 00:34:50,405
Why did she have to kill him? Tell me.

398
00:34:51,462 --> 00:34:52,882
Because she's crazy.

399
00:34:53,201 --> 00:34:55,844
Do you have
a logical explanation behind this?

400
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:59,347
Are you questioning my authority?

401
00:35:02,102 --> 00:35:03,187
No, sir.

402
00:35:04,819 --> 00:35:07,522
It's just that the method of
killing is different for both victims.

403
00:35:08,198 --> 00:35:12,694
- Em's was very methodical--
- This is an emotional killer!

404
00:35:13,513 --> 00:35:16,265
She isn't methodical
unlike the serial killers abroad!

405
00:35:16,557 --> 00:35:19,200
- And if you're saying that she's crazy--
- Bullshit!

406
00:35:19,688 --> 00:35:20,894
What's your point?

407
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:25,624
I want to handle the case again.

408
00:35:26,038 --> 00:35:27,626
That won't work anymore.

409
00:35:27,804 --> 00:35:32,130
I wasn't referring to
Em's case but to Trent's.

410
00:35:34,823 --> 00:35:36,034
It depends.

411
00:35:37,495 --> 00:35:40,330
I can do something about it.

412
00:35:41,541 --> 00:35:44,918
But the question is, what's in it for me?

413
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,527
Elaine...

414
00:35:56,239 --> 00:35:57,822
- Elaine..
- You monster!

415
00:35:58,258 --> 00:36:00,301
You've been fooling me all along!

416
00:36:00,724 --> 00:36:03,286
You're the guy in the sex scandal!

417
00:36:03,771 --> 00:36:06,915
You ruined my daughter's life!

418
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,228
I can explain.

419
00:36:08,253 --> 00:36:11,419
I gave you a chance
to tell me the truth, but you lied.

420
00:36:11,696 --> 00:36:15,131
Do you think you can cover up.....

421
00:36:15,399 --> 00:36:19,286
your wrongdoings by helping out?

422
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,955
Go away!

423
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:25,376
I don't need your help!

424
00:36:25,401 --> 00:36:26,394
I'm sorry,

425
00:36:26,602 --> 00:36:29,689
Elaine. I'll get to the bottom of this.

426
00:36:29,714 --> 00:36:30,772
No need.

427
00:36:31,841 --> 00:36:33,842
It all makes sense now:

428
00:36:34,508 --> 00:36:37,862
You're the reason behind all of this.

429
00:36:38,264 --> 00:36:40,240
If you're sincerely apologetic,

430
00:36:40,767 --> 00:36:43,144
then just respect Em's memory.

431
00:36:43,686 --> 00:36:45,188
Leave!

432
00:36:46,189 --> 00:36:47,564
Leave!

433
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:05,374
Surprise!

434
00:37:05,812 --> 00:37:07,100
What are you looking at?

435
00:37:07,668 --> 00:37:08,753
Look at this.

436
00:37:09,754 --> 00:37:10,880
What do you see?

437
00:37:11,631 --> 00:37:14,023
- That's not a Blake's hitch.
- Correct.

438
00:37:14,675 --> 00:37:16,943
It's a normal, sloppy knot.

439
00:37:17,178 --> 00:37:19,137
No technique and method.

440
00:37:19,764 --> 00:37:21,099
What does that imply?

441
00:37:21,516 --> 00:37:23,351
Agatha didn't kill Em.

442
00:37:23,684 --> 00:37:27,271
So Congressman Chuatico
is still your prime suspect?

443
00:37:27,772 --> 00:37:28,813
I'm not sure.

444
00:37:29,607 --> 00:37:32,776
I confronted him a while ago.

445
00:37:34,904 --> 00:37:37,297
I asked him if he had Trent killed...

446
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:38,299
but obviously,

447
00:37:38,324 --> 00:37:39,674
he didn't.

448
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,217
And he wasn't lying.

449
00:37:42,292 --> 00:37:44,304
It was the same reaction
that he gave me...

450
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:45,972
when I asked him about Em's murder.

451
00:37:46,374 --> 00:37:47,542
He didn't know anything.

452
00:37:47,567 --> 00:37:50,710
If he was indeed the mastermind,

453
00:37:51,212 --> 00:37:54,507
then he would've surrendered
because he also killed his child.

454
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:56,483
But until now, no one is surrendering.

455
00:37:57,093 --> 00:37:58,009
Alright.

456
00:37:58,469 --> 00:38:01,846
I wasted a lot of time on
this case for nothing.

457
00:38:02,974 --> 00:38:05,143
Also, Em's uncensored scandal
is already out.

458
00:38:05,393 --> 00:38:08,228
That means that Trent wasn't the uploader.

459
00:38:08,729 --> 00:38:11,189
He wasn't blackmailing the congressman.

460
00:38:12,168 --> 00:38:14,000
Then who's the source of the sex scandal?

461
00:38:14,905 --> 00:38:16,986
That's what I told Choi to trace.

462
00:38:17,989 --> 00:38:21,993
But what would they
get from uploading the scandal?

463
00:38:22,018 --> 00:38:24,577
Obviously, they wanted to
malign the congressman.

464
00:38:28,875 --> 00:38:30,542
Hang on. I need to call someone.

465
00:38:43,973 --> 00:38:46,517
DON'T FORGET OUR DEAL TONIGHT.

466
00:38:46,517 --> 00:38:48,227
I'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU.

467
00:38:48,227 --> 00:38:49,854
REMEMBER, THIS IS IN
EXCHANGE FOR THE CASE.

468
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:56,484
Why? What do you want?

469
00:38:59,238 --> 00:39:02,532
You know that I've always
wanted to sleep with you.

470
00:40:02,635 --> 00:40:05,345
Please, don't hang up.

471
00:40:06,492 --> 00:40:08,890
I didn't call to have a fight with you.

472
00:40:12,131 --> 00:40:13,633
I called because....

473
00:40:13,896 --> 00:40:16,272
I want to offer a solution to your problem.

474
00:40:17,066 --> 00:40:21,569
I know it's a huge mess
to be involved in Em's scandal,

475
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,366
so I have a proposal for you.

476
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,452
We can face the public...

477
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:33,289
and act as a couple.

478
00:40:35,251 --> 00:40:38,294
I, as a forgiving wife,

479
00:40:38,966 --> 00:40:39,921
and you,

480
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:42,715
as a redeeming husband.

481
00:40:47,054 --> 00:40:48,404
What do you want in return?

482
00:40:48,848 --> 00:40:49,739
Nothing.

483
00:40:50,182 --> 00:40:52,200
Just go back home...

484
00:40:52,518 --> 00:40:54,035
and let's talk things out.

485
00:43:16,162 --> 00:43:17,036
Dad,

486
00:43:18,205 --> 00:43:19,455
I promise

487
00:43:21,362 --> 00:43:23,001
that after this case,

488
00:43:25,531 --> 00:43:27,880
I'll solve your murder.

489
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,801
I won't stop

490
00:43:34,063 --> 00:43:36,305
until you get justice.

491
00:44:53,175 --> 00:44:55,503
To Em's detractors,

492
00:44:55,528 --> 00:44:59,073
I'm telling you,
you're messing with the wrong person.

493
00:44:59,098 --> 00:45:01,130
You have no idea
what I am going through.

494
00:45:01,155 --> 00:45:03,365
Your dad asked me to look after you.

495
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:05,311
Let me take care of it.

496
00:45:05,336 --> 00:45:09,040
I want to answer your questions
but I am still in pain.

497
00:45:09,389 --> 00:45:10,958
It looks good, doesn't it?

498
00:45:14,697 --> 00:45:15,614
Let's end this.

499
00:45:15,639 --> 00:45:17,006
Let's not make this hard for you.
