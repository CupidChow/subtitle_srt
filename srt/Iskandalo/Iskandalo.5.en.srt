1
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:03,865
I don’t have an affair, Dad.

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:05,505
Don't lie to me.

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,732
Why did you initiate a sloppy operation
instead of following our protocol?

4
00:00:07,757 --> 00:00:08,650
Today is my first day.

5
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:09,609
I don't work for free.

6
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:10,802
- Are you good?
- At what?

7
00:00:10,827 --> 00:00:13,305
Tell me what
keeps you up at night.

8
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,806
What else do you
know about Em's case?

9
00:00:14,831 --> 00:00:15,573
Dead or alive.

10
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:16,658
Is two million pesos
enough as a cash reward?

11
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,144
Can you still
recognize the guy?

12
00:00:19,169 --> 00:00:20,145
The guy?

13
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,439
She's a girl!
Here, take a look...

14
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,749
We discovered
a blog run by Agatha.

15
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,710
It's a fan fiction where she
and Em are the lead characters.

16
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,262
It has explicit content.

17
00:00:30,117 --> 00:00:32,182
Why don't we just
enjoy this moment?

18
00:03:02,732 --> 00:03:06,061
You know what,
why don't we celebrate?

19
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,395
Celebrate what?

20
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,539
Just the usual celebration.

21
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:13,151
Since Philip has allowed us
to take full control of the case,

22
00:03:13,262 --> 00:03:14,778
and we already have a suspect.

23
00:03:14,803 --> 00:03:17,948
We've also quelled Elaine
and Chuatico's apprehensions.

24
00:03:18,257 --> 00:03:19,449
What's going on with them?

25
00:03:19,474 --> 00:03:20,392
Are they a couple?

26
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:22,411
Why? Can you imagine
them having sex?

27
00:03:22,892 --> 00:03:24,204
That's disgusting, Armand.

28
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:26,231
Enough with
your dirty thoughts.

29
00:03:42,477 --> 00:03:44,833
Sir, please follow that car.

30
00:03:45,795 --> 00:03:47,519
That's not where we are headed.

31
00:03:48,415 --> 00:03:51,273
I don't care. Just follow it.

32
00:03:57,127 --> 00:03:58,545
I'm not satisfied.

33
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:00,073
With what?

34
00:04:00,257 --> 00:04:01,867
With Agatha.

35
00:04:02,372 --> 00:04:03,702
like there's something wrong.

36
00:04:03,727 --> 00:04:07,147
Look, it's possible that
she's connected to the case,

37
00:04:07,582 --> 00:04:10,817
but can she really carry
Em on her own and hang her?

38
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:14,029
She might have an accomplice.

39
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,726
There's two of them.

40
00:04:16,521 --> 00:04:18,700
What if Agatha is not the killer?

41
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,469
And if she isn't?

42
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:24,540
We'll find out once she gets caught.
Let's celebrate for now!

43
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:26,699
I got a text message
from Agent Bacolod.

44
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,576
Today is his birthday.

45
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,520
Let's go and crash his party.

46
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,521
Cut it out.

47
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:34,399
Excuse me. I'll just go upstairs
to finish something.

48
00:04:34,477 --> 00:04:36,026
What do you mean?

49
00:04:36,051 --> 00:04:37,594
We're gonna get drunk!

50
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:38,695
Hey! Come on!

51
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,280
I'll join you next time.

52
00:04:40,305 --> 00:04:41,890
But beer is life!

53
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:00,717
You fucking cheater!

54
00:05:00,742 --> 00:05:02,744
Let's eat?

55
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,329
We can't.

56
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:07,599
They might recognize me.

57
00:05:07,895 --> 00:05:09,267
You might get in trouble.

58
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:11,211
How can I help you

59
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,356
if you won't let me?

60
00:05:13,503 --> 00:05:14,731
Is this still about your estafa case?

61
00:05:15,805 --> 00:05:16,858
I'll help you.

62
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:19,170
I'll hire a lawyer for you.

63
00:05:19,428 --> 00:05:22,989
I cannot help you if you're
keeping things from me.

64
00:05:23,154 --> 00:05:24,239
I said forget it!

65
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,825
You're such a nag!

66
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,327
Well, fuck you!

67
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,438
I'm just trying to help you!

68
00:05:29,803 --> 00:05:31,039
Fuck you, too!

69
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,207
Just help out if
you really mean it,

70
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,351
without fishing
for information!

71
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,795
Do I have to disclose
everything to you?

72
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,714
- Then don't!
- Stop it!

73
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:43,952
I'll be around for just another week.
After this, you're on your own.

74
00:05:44,122 --> 00:05:45,136
Fine!

75
00:05:45,161 --> 00:05:47,622
I can manage!
Now, get out of my sight!

76
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,540
Leave!

77
00:05:48,955 --> 00:05:49,833
Go away!

78
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,726
Fuck you!

79
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:52,727
Moron!

80
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:53,795
Dickhead!

81
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,433
I thought you weren't coming.

82
00:06:07,236 --> 00:06:08,488
Take a seat.

83
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,043
Stop it.

84
00:06:29,497 --> 00:06:30,749
What's wrong?

85
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:33,001
I just missed you.

86
00:06:34,184 --> 00:06:36,046
My daughter just died.

87
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,466
I was accused of killing her.

88
00:06:42,427 --> 00:06:44,429
That's why I'm here...

89
00:06:45,036 --> 00:06:47,390
Jane, things have been
complicated for me.

90
00:06:49,025 --> 00:06:51,061
I'm here to help you

91
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:55,023
so you can relax
for a moment.

92
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,034
Here you go.

93
00:07:42,221 --> 00:07:43,363
Hang on.

94
00:07:43,658 --> 00:07:45,215
What the hell
is your problem?

95
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,616
Fuck this shit!

96
00:07:47,891 --> 00:07:49,578
Let's put an end to this.

97
00:07:51,212 --> 00:07:52,956
I don't want this anymore.

98
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,225
I feel guilty
whenever I think of Em.

99
00:07:56,668 --> 00:07:57,961
What do you mean?

100
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:02,940
Joel!

101
00:08:02,965 --> 00:08:04,859
Ma'am... Ma'am.

102
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:06,043
- Joel!
- Ma'am!

103
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:08,488
- You're not allowed here. The guests--
- Joel!

104
00:08:08,513 --> 00:08:11,783
- This is off limits to non-guests.
- Son of a bitch! Let go of me!

105
00:08:11,808 --> 00:08:13,050
- Elaine...
- Joel!

106
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:13,576
Elaine!

107
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:14,785
- You monster!
- Hold up.

108
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,205
- Sir, let me take care of this.
- What the fuck?!

109
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,249
How could you do this to me?

110
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:21,125
This isn't what you're thinking.

111
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,585
Then what are you doing here?

112
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,937
This is a motel!
What are you here for? Networking?

113
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,631
- No, let me explain.
- Bullshit!

114
00:08:26,656 --> 00:08:29,284
Don't ever show
your face to me again!

115
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:30,610
Elaine, let's talk. Listen to me.

116
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,028
- Don't touch me!
- Please!

117
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,945
- Listen to me first.
- No!

118
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:34,806
Elaine!

119
00:08:34,998 --> 00:08:35,874
Elaine...

120
00:08:44,976 --> 00:08:45,967
Patricia...

121
00:08:49,841 --> 00:08:51,931
I just wanted to say thank you

122
00:08:52,716 --> 00:08:54,517
for not telling Philip what happened.

123
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:56,387
It's fine.

124
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,064
I figured you were right.

125
00:09:00,341 --> 00:09:04,110
We're under scrutiny in this office,
especially us, women.

126
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,656
I don't want us to get
awkward with each other.

127
00:09:08,427 --> 00:09:10,846
By the way,
I want to ask you a favor.

128
00:09:10,871 --> 00:09:12,343
Sure, anything within my means.

129
00:09:12,368 --> 00:09:14,612
Since you're dating Lorenzo,

130
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,765
maybe you can ask him
to update me on the Samaniego--

131
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,918
Sorry to interrupt you, Patricia,

132
00:09:20,838 --> 00:09:23,216
but we haven't been okay lately.

133
00:09:24,782 --> 00:09:26,367
Okay, no problem.

134
00:09:26,969 --> 00:09:28,718
- I'll go ahead.
- Alright.

135
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:39,996
CAN YOU PLEASE UPDATE ME
ON THE SAMANIEGO CASE?

136
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:45,209
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO
HELP YOU SOLVE THE CASE.

137
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:49,617
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CREDIT ME.
I JUST NEED IT RESOLVED.

138
00:10:08,266 --> 00:10:11,853
Patricia, I want to tell how I feel--

139
00:10:12,171 --> 00:10:13,346
Too cheesy.

140
00:10:15,152 --> 00:10:18,476
Patricia, I want you to be mine.

141
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:20,395
Doesn't sound right.

142
00:10:21,305 --> 00:10:23,648
Patricia, please be mine...

143
00:10:24,826 --> 00:10:25,900
and I'll be yours.

144
00:10:28,714 --> 00:10:33,132
♪ Happy birthday to you... ♪

145
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:38,012

00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,193
Make a wish!

150
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,903
World peace, alright!

151
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:57,490
- Happy birthday, Bacolod!
- Thank you!

152
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,117
- Cheers!
- Bacolod, happy birthday!

153
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,078
You better get married soon.
You're not getting any younger.

154
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,122
You are older than I am,
so you should get married before me.

155
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:07,458
Why don't you date Patricia?

156
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,503
Hey, don't drag me into that thing.

157
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,422
Come on, Patricia!
Date Armand already!

158
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,757
How about Wanda?

159
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,718
- Hey, I'm out of this.
- Good call! Cheers!

160
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,932
Let's eat!

161
00:11:52,136 --> 00:11:54,638
Hello? Hello!
Hi, Inked Saigon!

162
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:58,175
This is Inked Saigon, right?

163
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,260
May I talk to your owner?

164
00:12:02,158 --> 00:12:02,972
Hello?

165
00:12:03,482 --> 00:12:04,307
Hello?

166
00:12:05,534 --> 00:12:06,952
What the fuck?
That was rude.

167
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:12,257
Patricia, may I
talk to you in private?

168
00:12:12,942 --> 00:12:14,110
Sure.

169
00:12:22,543 --> 00:12:23,852
What's up?

170
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,668
Don't tell me
you're going to court me.

171
00:12:26,967 --> 00:12:28,677
What if I will?

172
00:12:28,702 --> 00:12:29,916
Is this a prank?

173
00:12:30,189 --> 00:12:31,167
Hang on...

174
00:12:31,849 --> 00:12:33,142
Are there cameras around?

175
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,255
Hey...

176
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,215
Are you serious?

177
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:43,220
I've been wanting
to tell you this,

178
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,374
but it's only now that
I got the courage to do so.

179
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,878
I'm sorry, Armand,

180
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:55,399
but I don't date my workmates.

181
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,193
Also, I don't want
to get to a point

182
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:00,446
where I have to choose
between love and career.

183
00:13:01,358 --> 00:13:04,158
Don't I really have a chance with you, Pat?

184
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,536
I just don't want to keep your hopes up.

185
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:11,592
Besides, I'm good with
what we have now.

186
00:13:12,337 --> 00:13:15,111
Workmates and friends.

187
00:13:30,236 --> 00:13:31,362
I'll just take this call.

188
00:13:36,898 --> 00:13:40,985
Don't be surprised if we'll have
you pay the bill later.

189
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,281
BUSY? LET'S MEET UP. RE: SAMANIEGO.

190
00:14:09,895 --> 00:14:13,086
Hi! Hi, yes! Inked Saigon! Finally!

191
00:14:13,782 --> 00:14:15,171
I was the one who called earlier.

192
00:14:15,591 --> 00:14:16,801
Yes, that was me.

193
00:14:18,321 --> 00:14:19,238
Hello?

194
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,416
Hello?

195
00:14:20,948 --> 00:14:21,803
Fuck!

196
00:14:23,617 --> 00:14:24,534
Fuck!

197
00:14:55,561 --> 00:15:03,277
I’M HERE.
WHERE ARE YOU?

198
00:15:12,189 --> 00:15:14,939
Patricia, if you don't stop,
I will have to suspend you.

199
00:15:15,643 --> 00:15:16,833
Fuck.

200
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,612
Will you ever obey my orders?

201
00:15:22,539 --> 00:15:26,092
Do you really have to chat Lorenzo
about the Samaniego case?

202
00:15:26,435 --> 00:15:27,561
Stop it.

203
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,095
Sir,

204
00:15:29,621 --> 00:15:32,457
you know how important
this case is to me.

205
00:15:32,574 --> 00:15:34,308
It wasn't my decision.

206
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,750
I was just following orders.

207
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:38,588
But if it were up to me,
I'd do the same.

208
00:15:39,391 --> 00:15:41,607
It was becoming too personal for you.

209
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,819
You even had to
seduce Lorenzo

210
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,846
just to get information on the case.

211
00:15:49,296 --> 00:15:50,282
Seduce?

212
00:15:50,307 --> 00:15:53,311
Lorenzo showed
me your text messages.

213
00:15:54,043 --> 00:15:56,789
Your lewd tricks won't cut it, Patricia.

214
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:01,544
And now you're wondering
why your career isn't progressing.

215
00:16:02,811 --> 00:16:05,281
I'm doing my job well, sir.

216
00:16:07,473 --> 00:16:09,702
Fuck it. You're too emotional.

217
00:16:10,206 --> 00:16:13,084
You women are
so caught up with your emotions.

218
00:16:14,105 --> 00:16:18,252
So this is about me being a woman, sir?

219
00:16:19,803 --> 00:16:21,964
This is going nowhere.

220
00:16:22,924 --> 00:16:24,384
That's enough, Patricia.

221
00:16:24,827 --> 00:16:28,121
Let go of the case and we're good.

222
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:31,557
You're not helping Lorenzo solve the case.

223
00:16:58,229 --> 00:17:00,478
Choi, why are
you still here?

224
00:17:00,617 --> 00:17:02,271
Aren't you going to the party?

225
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,215
I'm not a PBI agent.

226
00:17:05,686 --> 00:17:06,984
How about you?

227
00:17:07,184 --> 00:17:08,402
Why aren't you at the party?

228
00:17:09,968 --> 00:17:11,720
I left some files.

229
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:16,018
Did you cry?

230
00:17:17,256 --> 00:17:19,147
Or did you smoke weed?

231
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:22,108
I don't do drugs.

232
00:17:28,946 --> 00:17:30,158
Do you need someone to talk to?

233
00:20:32,754 --> 00:20:34,717
Just tell me when
you're ready to talk.

234
00:20:42,615 --> 00:20:44,560
You know, I always feel

235
00:20:47,665 --> 00:20:49,440
that I'm not enough.

236
00:20:51,579 --> 00:20:53,290
That I am not

237
00:20:53,892 --> 00:20:55,488
as good as those men.

238
00:20:58,686 --> 00:20:59,867
They used to tell me

239
00:21:00,003 --> 00:21:01,661
to hold off on marriage.

240
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,514
So I didn't.

241
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:08,417
They told me not
to get pregnant because...

242
00:21:09,241 --> 00:21:11,827
my value in the work force will depreciate.

243
00:21:12,044 --> 00:21:13,798
I listened to them.

244
00:21:16,214 --> 00:21:17,968
But fuck, nothing happened.

245
00:21:31,349 --> 00:21:33,101
Have you ever thought of quitting?

246
00:21:35,384 --> 00:21:37,571
I love my job.

247
00:21:39,619 --> 00:21:41,409
I'm not doing anything wrong.

248
00:21:46,203 --> 00:21:47,665
So why would I quit?

249
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:51,460
Why is the Samaniego case
a big deal to you?

250
00:21:54,061 --> 00:21:55,464
I think they are...

251
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,763
the mastermind behind my dad's murder.

252
00:22:03,608 --> 00:22:06,058
How could they be
connected to your family?

253
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:09,745
I don't know.

254
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:11,772
That's what we were
trying to find out

255
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,734
until they took the case from us.

256
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:21,407
Until now, our only lead is the tattoo.

257
00:22:25,841 --> 00:22:27,455
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

258
00:22:28,102 --> 00:22:30,307
I have identified
the guy in Em’s sex scandal.

259
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:34,712
So...

260
00:22:36,332 --> 00:22:38,507
I had to manually search it.

261
00:22:39,152 --> 00:22:42,194
Inked Saigon's portfolio is on their IG,

262
00:22:42,306 --> 00:22:44,071
including the Ankh tattoo.

263
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:47,257
So I checked each one
and it has over a hundred likes,

264
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,617
but I found nothing suspicious.

265
00:22:48,692 --> 00:22:51,028
None of the likers have that tattoo.

266
00:22:51,362 --> 00:22:53,822
So, what I did next was...

267
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,709
I typed in random
keywords which are:

268
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,236
Inked Saigon,

269
00:23:00,425 --> 00:23:01,822
April 25th,

270
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,340
and Vietnam.

271
00:23:04,957 --> 00:23:05,759
Boom!

272
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:10,389
He was in Vietnam for
a Sustainable Development Summit!

273
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:13,542
And he took the opportunity
to get a tattoo and to have coffee.

274
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,402
This can't be real.

275
00:23:24,639 --> 00:23:25,613
Are you sure about this?

276
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:27,948
I, too, couldn't believe it.

277
00:23:28,077 --> 00:23:29,575
I had to make sure.

278
00:23:29,936 --> 00:23:31,702
So what I did next was...

279
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:35,289
I looked at each of
Em Celera's social media posts

280
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,707
and placed them side by side

281
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:38,692
with Congressman's.

282
00:23:38,998 --> 00:23:41,654
It took me hours but holy shit.

283
00:23:41,857 --> 00:23:43,172
Look at this...

284
00:23:58,808 --> 00:23:59,980
What do you think?

285
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:02,524
Do you think Stephen
has something to do with Em's murder?

286
00:24:04,066 --> 00:24:05,110
I don't know.

287
00:24:05,994 --> 00:24:07,613
but it makes sense

288
00:24:08,259 --> 00:24:10,741
why Stephen is always with Elaine

289
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:26,532
and why he is so
invested in Em's case.

290
00:24:29,555 --> 00:24:32,767
It makes sense, doesn't it?

291
00:24:33,134 --> 00:24:34,807
If it really was him

292
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,477
why would he release the video?

293
00:24:38,502 --> 00:24:39,436
I don't know.

294
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,647
I don't know anymore, Choi.

295
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,926
Belinda will be heartbroken
once she finds out.

296
00:25:01,236 --> 00:25:02,818
I have something for you.

297
00:25:12,185 --> 00:25:13,329
This is beautiful.

298
00:25:16,336 --> 00:25:17,249
May I?

299
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:19,309
Sure.

300
00:28:07,047 --> 00:28:08,395
Surprise!

301
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,397
Have you been waiting long?

302
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:11,857
No, I just arrived.

303
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,319
I decided to drop by
before heading to the office.

304
00:28:15,963 --> 00:28:17,923
I'm sorry if I only visited now.

305
00:28:18,178 --> 00:28:21,033
No worries. My mom will be
discharged in a few days.

306
00:28:21,058 --> 00:28:22,701
So I heard.

307
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:26,038
By the way, I already paid
the hospital bill.

308
00:28:26,063 --> 00:28:28,690
You didn't have to, Belinda.

309
00:28:28,813 --> 00:28:29,856
It's no big deal.

310
00:28:30,224 --> 00:28:31,902
We're like sisters, anyway.

311
00:28:32,609 --> 00:28:33,612
Besides,

312
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:38,951
you'll also help me
when I'm in need, right?

313
00:28:40,817 --> 00:28:42,037
Of course, I will.

314
00:29:26,829 --> 00:29:28,917
It's been a long time
since we last talked, Dad.

315
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,338
I know this is the life
that you chose for me.

316
00:29:33,937 --> 00:29:35,549
Be loyal to Pio...

317
00:29:36,866 --> 00:29:39,319
like how you  were loyal to him.

318
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:42,055
Build a family with Belinda.

319
00:29:43,207 --> 00:29:49,771
But I know you didn't
want to put me in danger.

320
00:29:50,949 --> 00:29:53,000
I know they're more
powerful than we are,

321
00:29:53,386 --> 00:29:58,363
but that doesn't mean
they can boss me around.

322
00:29:59,693 --> 00:30:07,456
If you were still here,
I know you'd always put up with Pio.

323
00:30:08,434 --> 00:30:10,058
But I'm not having it anymore.

324
00:30:10,871 --> 00:30:12,686
I want him to know that

325
00:30:13,078 --> 00:30:15,756
I am as powerful as him.

326
00:30:52,337 --> 00:30:54,086
Do you want to say something?

327
00:30:59,672 --> 00:31:01,510
I want to ask you something,

328
00:31:02,713 --> 00:31:04,596
but please don't get offended.

329
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:07,366
What is it?

330
00:31:14,153 --> 00:31:15,665
Are you aware...

331
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,902
that your husband has a mistress?

332
00:31:23,427 --> 00:31:25,575
You always ask me that.

333
00:31:27,676 --> 00:31:28,870
I don't know.

334
00:31:31,355 --> 00:31:32,666
Do you know anything?

335
00:31:35,034 --> 00:31:37,045
Does it have something to do...

336
00:31:37,676 --> 00:31:39,172
with Em Celera's case?

337
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,611
I just thought that--

338
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:48,432
Em was a campaign
supporter of Congressman.

339
00:31:50,436 --> 00:31:52,227
They were very close.

340
00:31:54,567 --> 00:31:56,106
Did I ever get jealous?

341
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:58,608
Yes.

342
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,491
Did I suspect that there was something
going on between them?

343
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:10,852
A little.

344
00:32:13,451 --> 00:32:15,156
But nothing more than that.

345
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,648
Of course,

346
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:24,234
I thought about it.

347
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,867
I'm not that naive.

348
00:32:38,229 --> 00:32:39,608
Do you believe him?

349
00:32:51,867 --> 00:32:56,057
I mean, after all
we've been through?

350
00:32:57,626 --> 00:32:59,895
Are you excited, my baby boy?

351
00:33:00,689 --> 00:33:02,981
Are you excited to see your daddy?

352
00:33:10,654 --> 00:33:11,823
Kael?

353
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,451
Kael!

354
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,303
Sir, you have a package.

355
00:33:35,528 --> 00:33:39,476
- Who is that from?
- Your son-in-law, Stephen Chuatico.

356
00:34:24,057 --> 00:34:26,660
Don’t ever threaten me
again if you don't want

357
00:34:26,684 --> 00:34:29,479
the whole country to
feast on this document.

358
00:34:30,298 --> 00:34:31,903
Congressman De Dios,
backer of drug syndicates.

359
00:34:32,641 --> 00:34:36,199
Congressman De Dios,
killer of journalists and state witnesses.

360
00:34:37,445 --> 00:34:38,727
Give me the same respect

361
00:34:39,502 --> 00:34:42,856
that you gave my father.

362
00:34:43,223 --> 00:34:44,975
Then we won’t  have a problem.

363
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,957
Damn you, Ruben.

364
00:35:03,621 --> 00:35:06,922
When will your ghost die?

365
00:35:39,835 --> 00:35:40,747
Yes, ma'am?

366
00:35:47,944 --> 00:35:50,148
Roger, have you
done my request?

367
00:35:50,173 --> 00:35:51,049
Yes, ma'am.

368
00:35:51,074 --> 00:35:51,925
Yes.

369
00:35:52,668 --> 00:35:54,010
Thank you, Roger.

370
00:35:54,287 --> 00:35:55,303
Alright, ma'am.

371
00:36:04,348 --> 00:36:10,016
WHAT TIME ARE YOU COMING HOME?
I'LL COOK DINNER.

372
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,883
DO NOT WAIT FOR ME.
I STILL HAVE TO GO SOMEWHERE.

373
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:21,758
AND IT'S THE LAST NIGHT OF EM'S WAKE.

374
00:36:48,231 --> 00:36:49,541
Do you love me?

375
00:36:49,566 --> 00:36:50,446
Em...

376
00:36:52,129 --> 00:36:53,253
Yes, of course.

377
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:25,785
Then why didn't you fight for me?

378
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:46,075
We are live here in
Manila Glorious Haven

379
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:51,603
where vlogger and actress
Em Celera will be laid to rest.

380
00:37:52,324 --> 00:37:55,231
The security is tight
and entry restrictions are imposed

381
00:37:55,256 --> 00:37:59,260
on the fans and members of the press.

382
00:38:00,614 --> 00:38:03,990
It's been days since Em died,

383
00:38:04,683 --> 00:38:08,353
but I still cannot accept that she's gone.

384
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:11,981
I still see her in my dreams.

385
00:38:12,136 --> 00:38:16,194
I can still feel her presence
whenever I'm alone.

386
00:38:20,235 --> 00:38:21,758
Em was a good daughter.

387
00:38:23,014 --> 00:38:25,391
She grew up brave

388
00:38:25,648 --> 00:38:28,139
and unafraid to stand her ground.

389
00:38:29,591 --> 00:38:31,292
We'd often fight...

390
00:38:32,364 --> 00:38:34,122
because she'd always go
for what she wanted

391
00:38:34,147 --> 00:38:37,732
even though I knew
that it wouldn't be good for her.

392
00:38:37,841 --> 00:38:39,801
But I couldn't do anything.

393
00:38:41,211 --> 00:38:43,655
We'd just fight
whenever I tried to stop her.

394
00:38:53,946 --> 00:38:55,191
Hello, Armand.

395
00:38:55,526 --> 00:38:56,735
How are things over there?

396
00:38:57,416 --> 00:38:59,195
There are no reporters around.

397
00:39:00,038 --> 00:39:01,414
No media as well.

398
00:39:02,225 --> 00:39:04,033
Even the police aren't here.

399
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:08,079
Maybe somebody's restricting them.
Only the family is here.

400
00:39:08,104 --> 00:39:08,972
Em,

401
00:39:09,951 --> 00:39:11,848
I know you're now in heaven

402
00:39:11,873 --> 00:39:14,794
because you were a good
daughter and a good friend.

403
00:39:15,306 --> 00:39:17,338
Always look after me, please,

404
00:39:18,139 --> 00:39:20,925
and your loved ones here on earth.

405
00:39:21,697 --> 00:39:23,720
Always pray for us.

406
00:39:34,815 --> 00:39:37,726
I assure you that
whoever hears my word

407
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:39,986
and believes in  the one who sent me

408
00:39:41,144 --> 00:39:43,187
...and won’t come  under judgment

409
00:39:43,399 --> 00:39:45,109
but has passed...

410
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:47,786
from death into life.

411
00:39:56,341 --> 00:39:57,420
Trent has arrived.

412
00:39:57,939 --> 00:39:59,232
What's happening?

413
00:40:01,819 --> 00:40:04,027
What are you doing here?!

414
00:40:04,394 --> 00:40:07,530
- You're the reason why Em died!
- Ma'am, hold on.

415
00:40:07,555 --> 00:40:08,723
- What are you doing here?!
- Ma'am, stop it!

416
00:40:08,748 --> 00:40:11,784
- How dare you go here!
- I'm just here to pay my respects.

417
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:13,995
Go away!
You don't deserve to be here!

418
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,564
Leave! This is all your fault!

419
00:40:19,948 --> 00:40:22,111
Trent is being escorted
by Mr. Congressman's bodyguards.

420
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,326
There's a commotion going on.
Where are you?

421
00:40:45,688 --> 00:40:47,695
Mr. Congressman is now walking to the van.

422
00:40:50,077 --> 00:40:53,476
He's about to get in.
I wonder where they are going.

423
00:40:54,876 --> 00:40:56,079
Where are you?

424
00:40:56,388 --> 00:40:57,288
Hello?

425
00:40:58,174 --> 00:41:00,166
Okay, copy.

426
00:41:00,603 --> 00:41:02,585
I know where to find them.

427
00:41:11,938 --> 00:41:14,315
Em...

428
00:41:19,127 --> 00:41:21,588
Em, why did you leave me?

429
00:41:29,575 --> 00:41:32,765
Sir, you're not allowed in here.

430
00:41:33,588 --> 00:41:36,216
Don't touch those, sir.
Those are Congressman's documents.

431
00:41:36,764 --> 00:41:38,099
Please, sir.

432
00:41:38,124 --> 00:41:39,375
Shut up!

433
00:41:46,102 --> 00:41:48,489
What are you looking for?
You won't find anything here.

434
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,494
Since when did you become
concerned with that actor?

435
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:21,708
Congressman Chuatico
is the guy in the sex scandal.

436
00:42:21,733 --> 00:42:22,681
I courted her.

437
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,041
We used to date before.

438
00:42:24,066 --> 00:42:26,611
What's with this necklace?

439
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:28,003
Why are you crying?

440
00:42:28,028 --> 00:42:29,154
Did they hurt you?

441
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:31,916
We already have a suspect
for Em Celera's murder.

442
00:42:31,941 --> 00:42:33,551
She is Agatha David.

443
00:42:33,576 --> 00:42:36,804
Ligtas Partylist is offering
a two-million-peso reward

444
00:42:36,829 --> 00:42:39,832
for the manhunt operation.

445
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:41,559
I can think of only
one person who can do this.

446
00:42:41,584 --> 00:42:42,769
Belinda De Dios.
