1
00:00:02,928 --> 00:00:04,179
She’s really something else!

2
00:00:04,204 --> 00:00:06,203
I bet it’s all for clout.

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,099
It's the Samaniego gang again.

4
00:00:08,124 --> 00:00:09,124
Freeze!

5
00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:13,071
We're getting close
to solving this case.

6
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:14,171
I'm pregnant.

7
00:00:14,196 --> 00:00:15,405
That's not my child.

8
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,264
That's what you get
for sleeping around.

9
00:00:18,148 --> 00:00:19,148
Why?

10
00:00:20,195 --> 00:00:22,188
Tell that to the guy
who knocked you up.

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,107
We worked our
assess off on that case.

12
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,275
We're just following orders.

13
00:00:26,275 --> 00:00:29,737
I'm sorry, but I'm taking
control of my life now.

14
00:04:36,353 --> 00:04:40,613
Celebrity vlogger Em Celera
was found dead this morning.

15
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:46,486
Celera was involved in a viral
sex scandal with an unknown man.

16
00:04:46,852 --> 00:04:52,845
Elaine Celera, the mother of the victim,
refuses to believe it was suicide.

17
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,237
She suspects that there
was foul play involved.

18
00:05:25,747 --> 00:05:27,707
She was so hardcore!

19
00:05:27,948 --> 00:05:32,535
- Hey! Don't be rude.
- Too bad, she died too soon.

20
00:05:32,936 --> 00:05:34,688
Hey, what are you looking at?

21
00:05:36,508 --> 00:05:38,301
Enough with your disgusting thoughts!

22
00:05:39,594 --> 00:05:41,805
See, I knew you'd also be hooked!

23
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,998
Admit it, you've seen this
a lot of times already.

24
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:46,146
What are you doing?

25
00:05:46,171 --> 00:05:47,908
- Nothing.
- Nothing, Ma'am.

26
00:05:49,013 --> 00:05:51,933
How dare you feast on a dead person.

27
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:56,963
- I'm not that kind of person.
- We feel bad because she was so young.

28
00:05:56,988 --> 00:05:59,364
I am just keeping my eye on the case.

29
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:02,220
What is this, a TV drama?

30
00:06:07,607 --> 00:06:10,658
Esguerra, to my office. Now.

31
00:06:22,744 --> 00:06:27,439
- She's gone. Let's continue watching.
- Go ahead, play it.

32
00:06:36,136 --> 00:06:41,308
Ms. Elaine Celera,
this is my agent, Patricia Esguerra.

33
00:06:42,003 --> 00:06:43,955
She will handle the case of your daughter.

34
00:06:45,191 --> 00:06:49,612
Patricia Esguerra, this is Elaine Celera,
the mother of Em Celera.

35
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:53,462
In case you haven't heard,
Em allegedly committed suicide.

36
00:06:54,117 --> 00:06:58,191
They want a thorough investigation
as they suspect foul play.

37
00:06:59,784 --> 00:07:03,162
This is Congressman Stephen Chuatico,

38
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:05,473
in case you didn't know.

39
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:07,572
No need for an introduction. I know her.

40
00:07:09,872 --> 00:07:10,956
I didn't know that.

41
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,726
I'm sorry for your loss, Mrs. Celera.

42
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,355
Don't worry, PBI will do everything

43
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,316
to solve your daughter's case.

44
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,903
Thank you.

45
00:07:28,245 --> 00:07:29,704
Chief, we'll go ahead.

46
00:07:30,608 --> 00:07:32,235
Let's go, Stephen.

47
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,922
Chief, this is not my case.

48
00:07:45,523 --> 00:07:47,859
Are you still mad about what
happened to the Gallardo case?

49
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,777
We worked hard on that case.

50
00:07:49,957 --> 00:07:52,029
We deserve to solve that case.

51
00:07:52,163 --> 00:07:53,832
You should move on.

52
00:07:54,763 --> 00:07:56,306
Take the Celera case.

53
00:07:57,021 --> 00:07:59,857
This is just a piece of cake for you.
This is sensational...

54
00:08:00,137 --> 00:08:01,823
and trending everywhere.

55
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:09,136
But you never told me
you're friends with Chuatico.

56
00:08:09,495 --> 00:08:11,132
He's my best friend's husband.

57
00:08:11,336 --> 00:08:12,433
That's all there is to it.

58
00:08:13,096 --> 00:08:14,456
We're not even close.

59
00:08:14,504 --> 00:08:16,547
You better start working with him.

60
00:08:17,573 --> 00:08:19,913
It's good to have your
own political ally, you know.

61
00:08:20,614 --> 00:08:22,450
You'll be promoted in no time.

62
00:08:29,021 --> 00:08:31,690
I'll see what I can do
with the Gallardo case.

63
00:08:32,141 --> 00:08:33,933
But just work on this case for now.

64
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:36,105
Understand?

65
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:55,410
Patricia...

66
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,831
I thought you already left.

67
00:09:00,198 --> 00:09:02,746
I'm about to, but I just
wanna say thank you.

68
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:04,344
For what?

69
00:09:05,414 --> 00:09:08,584
I'm glad that Em's case
is being handled by a friend.

70
00:09:09,694 --> 00:09:12,739
Did you request them
to assign the case to me?

71
00:09:13,472 --> 00:09:14,557
Not really.

72
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:18,516
It's my job.

73
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,853
The public is paying me to do this.

74
00:09:24,527 --> 00:09:27,375
If you need anything
to expedite the investigation,

75
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,526
just let me know.

76
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,528
I'll do whatever I can.

77
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,282
What's in it for you, Stephen?

78
00:09:35,652 --> 00:09:36,719
What?

79
00:09:36,744 --> 00:09:40,873
Will you gain anything
from meddling in this case?

80
00:09:41,323 --> 00:09:42,824
Em was my friend.

81
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,794
I want to give her
the justice she deserves.

82
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:48,630
Rest assured,

83
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,508
I'll do the same thing for you.

84
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,388
Well then.

85
00:10:09,471 --> 00:10:12,200
That Pat Esguerra doesn’t
seem competent enough.

86
00:10:17,386 --> 00:10:21,676
Elaine, I can assure
you that she is excellent.

87
00:10:24,378 --> 00:10:30,009
Patricia has always
wanted to be a PBI agent.

88
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,647
Do you wanna say anything?

89
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:51,710
I'm thinking of

90
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:53,720
inviting you to dinner.

91
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,242
With the boys?

92
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,329
Just the two of us.

93
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:06,916
A friendly date?

94
00:11:07,672 --> 00:11:09,424
I'm taking my chances.

95
00:11:12,957 --> 00:11:16,879
Alright. Just make sure
that it's just a friendly date.

96
00:11:17,068 --> 00:11:19,863
But I'm only available
after the Celera case,

97
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:22,004
so you better do well.

98
00:11:22,692 --> 00:11:24,405
I will, I promise.

99
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:25,514
I'll do my best.

100
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,794
I can manage.

101
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:00,715
Start asking questions.

102
00:12:01,385 --> 00:12:04,657
Ask them if there was something
suspicious during that night.

103
00:12:04,941 --> 00:12:09,291
Go to the local unit
and coordinate with them.

104
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:10,871
Are you sure?

105
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,844
I already asked around.

106
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,916
They didn't see anyone suspicious.

107
00:16:53,945 --> 00:16:55,780
The police have been there as well.

108
00:16:55,952 --> 00:16:57,495
I also asked the local officers.

109
00:16:58,046 --> 00:17:00,590
I didn't see any signs of forced entry.

110
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,149
Is it possible that Em knew
who the killer was?

111
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:08,069
Yes, it is.

112
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:13,491
But what if she wasn't killed?

113
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:17,119
What if she really took her own life?

114
00:17:24,399 --> 00:17:25,479
Chief?

115
00:17:26,126 --> 00:17:28,564
Patricia, report to the Medico Legal

116
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,143
and go straight to the morgue.

117
00:17:30,168 --> 00:17:31,711
They already have findings.

118
00:17:39,048 --> 00:17:42,079
The medical report has been released.

119
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,688
Let's go back to the office.

120
00:17:43,845 --> 00:17:45,182
Alright. Let me drive.

121
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:51,278
Pat...

122
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,377
- Yes?
- Patricia, have you seen this?

123
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,677
Hello, everyone! Hello, Em-nation!

124
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:59,579
Your bubbly Em is back...

125
00:17:59,637 --> 00:18:03,516
I was informed that this is
the reason why she got killed.

126
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,661
They said she was going to
reveal some dark secrets.

127
00:18:05,686 --> 00:18:08,605
Don’t be so gullible.
They're just trying to milk the issue.

128
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:13,251
But what if this is the
real reason behind her death?

129
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:16,012
That’s one angle we can look into.

130
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:22,206
Have you seen her sex scandal?

131
00:18:22,451 --> 00:18:25,297
Saw it because of the boys.

132
00:18:25,322 --> 00:18:26,365
Was it good?

133
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,776
What am I? A sex scandal critic?

134
00:18:28,987 --> 00:18:31,680
I don't get why you're so into it.

135
00:18:31,705 --> 00:18:33,134
What do you even gain from it?

136
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:35,328
It's pure curiosity.

137
00:18:35,328 --> 00:18:37,205
We want to know more about it.

138
00:18:37,205 --> 00:18:39,260
- We want to get involved.
- In short, libido.

139
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:40,580
Of course not.

140
00:18:42,103 --> 00:18:44,223
Do you know that what
you're doing is against the law?

141
00:18:44,671 --> 00:18:47,268
It’s not like we killed anybody!

142
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,967
You killed the woman's dignity,

143
00:18:49,834 --> 00:18:51,877
especially if she's not aware

144
00:18:51,902 --> 00:18:53,696
that she is being recorded.

145
00:18:54,555 --> 00:18:57,600
Come on, don't be too serious.

146
00:18:59,432 --> 00:19:01,100
I'm thinking...

147
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:04,544
There are just two possible suspects.

148
00:19:06,734 --> 00:19:10,196
The man in the scandal.

149
00:19:10,822 --> 00:19:13,366
Or the one who uploaded the video.

150
00:19:13,575 --> 00:19:14,576
Guys!

151
00:19:14,601 --> 00:19:16,811
The Medico Legal has
been waiting for you.

152
00:19:16,911 --> 00:19:17,912
Sir!

153
00:19:25,395 --> 00:19:29,274
The victim died of asphyxiation,
possibly from strangulation.

154
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:31,009
Because she was hung?

155
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:34,345
She got the rope burn before she died.

156
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,580
What does that mean?

157
00:19:35,654 --> 00:19:37,713
She was already dead
when she was hung.

158
00:19:38,873 --> 00:19:41,042
Her neck wasn't extended.

159
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,955
She doesn't have saliva marks

160
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,994
which is a hallmark of
suicide by hanging.

161
00:19:48,373 --> 00:19:50,041
That means somebody killed her.

162
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:51,104
Yes.

163
00:19:51,362 --> 00:19:54,491
Skin samples were
found under her nails.

164
00:19:54,624 --> 00:19:56,501
It means that she fought back.

165
00:19:56,526 --> 00:19:58,893
We already sent the
samples for DNA testing.

166
00:20:18,746 --> 00:20:20,276
Carabao grass.

167
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:25,151
I found this at
the Celera farmhouse.

168
00:20:27,335 --> 00:20:29,541
That's probably
where she was killed.

169
00:20:31,162 --> 00:20:32,580
The suspect missed this

170
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:34,660
and left evidence.

171
00:20:35,216 --> 00:20:38,969
And lastly, the victim was
three months pregnant.

172
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:59,333
My daughter was pregnant?

173
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,193
You weren't aware, Ma'am?

174
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:06,979
I had no idea. I didn't know.

175
00:21:08,556 --> 00:21:11,328
Em was keeping a lot from me.

176
00:21:13,947 --> 00:21:16,182
I'm begging you, Agent Esguerra,

177
00:21:16,885 --> 00:21:18,386
let's not disclose this information.

178
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:20,121
The news reporters
will surely feast on it.

179
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:23,467
I’m begging you, please.

180
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:25,251
Alright, Ma'am.

181
00:21:25,276 --> 00:21:26,486
If that's what you want.

182
00:21:27,033 --> 00:21:32,217
Who do you think was the father?

183
00:21:34,677 --> 00:21:38,473
When Em died, I saw her phone.

184
00:21:40,584 --> 00:21:42,169
I went through it.

185
00:21:42,977 --> 00:21:48,166
I was looking for clues
or a suicide note from her.

186
00:21:48,191 --> 00:21:50,651
I was just trying my luck.

187
00:21:51,556 --> 00:21:55,160
I called the most recent
number in her phone log.

188
00:21:56,616 --> 00:21:57,867
What!?

189
00:21:58,117 --> 00:21:59,369
What now!?

190
00:22:03,081 --> 00:22:04,791
And who was it?

191
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,213
Trent.

192
00:22:11,256 --> 00:22:12,341
Trent?

193
00:22:12,366 --> 00:22:14,596
Trent Martinez? The bad boy heartthrob?

194
00:22:25,926 --> 00:22:27,970
Miss, are you alone?

195
00:22:27,995 --> 00:22:29,622
Do you want us to join you?

196
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,069
We thought you might need some company.

197
00:22:33,663 --> 00:22:35,645
Is it okay if we take a photo with you?

198
00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:37,806
I'm sorry, but I don't want to.

199
00:22:37,884 --> 00:22:39,886
Just give us your mobile number then.

200
00:22:43,035 --> 00:22:44,995
Seems like she's not interested, bro.

201
00:22:45,861 --> 00:22:47,154
Playing hard to get, Miss?

202
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:48,179
Who do you think you are?

203
00:22:49,043 --> 00:22:50,461
Aren't you interested?

204
00:22:51,262 --> 00:22:52,522
Why so picky, Miss?

205
00:22:52,547 --> 00:22:53,631
Who do you think you are?

206
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:55,170
Jerk.

207
00:23:01,227 --> 00:23:03,015
- Let's go, guys!
- Go away!

208
00:23:12,508 --> 00:23:13,857
Miss, are you okay?

209
00:23:19,073 --> 00:23:20,700
I'm Trent Martinez.

210
00:23:24,245 --> 00:23:25,663
I'm Em.

211
00:23:37,342 --> 00:23:38,954
Don't mind those assholes.

212
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:41,127
Thanks for stepping in.

213
00:23:42,383 --> 00:23:44,468
I thought you're an asshole, too.

214
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,525
Me, an asshole?

215
00:23:48,061 --> 00:23:51,856
Your vibe is different
from other matinee idols.

216
00:23:52,454 --> 00:23:54,567
They are all so boring

217
00:23:54,802 --> 00:23:56,220
while you...

218
00:23:56,844 --> 00:23:58,629
seem so mysterious.

219
00:24:02,971 --> 00:24:04,795
You bet I am.

220
00:24:10,154 --> 00:24:11,530
I’ll have a beer.

221
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:01,186
This is one of the
angles we can look into.

222
00:26:27,566 --> 00:26:28,567
I'm pregnant.

223
00:26:28,844 --> 00:26:30,053
That's not mine.

224
00:26:30,306 --> 00:26:32,266
That's what you get
for sleeping around!

225
00:26:33,976 --> 00:26:35,612
What the hell!?

226
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:36,888
Stop it!

227
00:26:42,151 --> 00:26:43,361
Trent!

228
00:28:33,571 --> 00:28:34,823
Cut!

229
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:38,675
What's wrong with you, Trent?

230
00:28:39,869 --> 00:28:41,704
You look so dull.

231
00:28:42,227 --> 00:28:44,003
- I'm sorry Director.
- What now?

232
00:28:44,331 --> 00:28:46,875
You're not acting
with your eyes.

233
00:28:47,106 --> 00:28:48,774
Are you tired?

234
00:28:49,922 --> 00:28:51,072
Are you sick?

235
00:28:51,097 --> 00:28:53,015
We need to finish this.

236
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:55,483
Our bosses are going to lash out on us.

237
00:28:55,766 --> 00:28:56,809
I'm sorry.

238
00:28:56,834 --> 00:28:58,252
Are you not feeling well?

239
00:28:58,981 --> 00:29:00,691
I'm just tired.

240
00:29:00,716 --> 00:29:02,551
Do you want a retake?

241
00:29:02,576 --> 00:29:04,036
Do you want to sleep first? Tell me.

242
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,579
Let me sleep first.

243
00:29:08,815 --> 00:29:11,359
I don't feel well.

244
00:29:11,821 --> 00:29:13,953
Fine. Take a rest.

245
00:29:13,978 --> 00:29:16,773
Let's shoot the next sequence.

246
00:29:18,711 --> 00:29:20,921
Sorry for the interruption, Sir.

247
00:29:20,946 --> 00:29:22,490
Yes, what's this all about?

248
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:24,914
Are you Trent Martinez?

249
00:29:27,734 --> 00:29:29,069
Yes, I am.

250
00:29:29,444 --> 00:29:31,539
May we invite you over to
the precinct for questioning?

251
00:29:45,573 --> 00:29:48,993
Em and I were going out,
but we weren't a couple.

252
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,434
So what were you?
Fuck buddies?

253
00:29:55,703 --> 00:29:58,367
You were with Em a few hours
before she died.

254
00:30:01,204 --> 00:30:03,110
What did you talk about?

255
00:30:06,156 --> 00:30:08,149
She wanted us to get back together.

256
00:30:09,196 --> 00:30:12,203
I thought you were just fuck buddies?

257
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:16,422
We used to be exclusive

258
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:19,459
until she fucked the guy
in the video.

259
00:30:24,557 --> 00:30:27,310
You have a girlfriend, am I right?

260
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,664
Arabella.

261
00:30:31,105 --> 00:30:32,649
I presume

262
00:30:33,812 --> 00:30:35,230
you also have sex with her.

263
00:30:35,255 --> 00:30:36,805
What kind of question is that?

264
00:30:37,066 --> 00:30:38,317
She's okay with it.

265
00:30:38,342 --> 00:30:40,260
It's part of our deal.

266
00:30:40,552 --> 00:30:43,047
So, you're not the guy in the scandal?

267
00:30:43,367 --> 00:30:44,748
That's not me.

268
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,322
Do you wanna see my back?

269
00:30:47,828 --> 00:30:49,115
You know who I am.

270
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:51,224
I should have a lawyer
to represent me.

271
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:54,024
You don't need one unless you're guilty.

272
00:30:57,587 --> 00:30:58,742
So, Trent...

273
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:02,716
What did you and Em talk about?

274
00:31:02,741 --> 00:31:04,946
She wanted me to break up
with Arabella.

275
00:31:06,078 --> 00:31:07,788
She wanted us to be a couple.

276
00:31:08,706 --> 00:31:10,266
But saying yes to it

277
00:31:11,375 --> 00:31:13,438
would mean throwing away my career.

278
00:31:13,836 --> 00:31:15,087
Do you love her?

279
00:31:19,049 --> 00:31:20,175
I don't know.

280
00:31:25,055 --> 00:31:28,183
I'm sorry if we were hard on you.

281
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:29,852
It's fine.

282
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:33,372
Just keep your lines open

283
00:31:33,397 --> 00:31:35,733
so that we can keep you posted.

284
00:31:35,758 --> 00:31:37,117
I also informed your manager about this.

285
00:31:38,652 --> 00:31:39,987
Thank you.

286
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,815
You animal!

287
00:31:45,909 --> 00:31:49,888
You killed my daughter!

288
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:53,109
- That's enough, Ma'am.
- What is he doing here?

289
00:31:53,134 --> 00:31:54,453
Put him in jail!

290
00:31:57,129 --> 00:31:59,715
Why did you let him leave?

291
00:31:59,882 --> 00:32:01,675
He killed Em!

292
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,360
Ma'am, his statement
is pretty accurate.

293
00:32:03,385 --> 00:32:05,697
He was also in a shoot when
the murder happened.

294
00:32:05,722 --> 00:32:08,399
What if he hired a killer?!
Did you even consider that angle?!

295
00:32:08,812 --> 00:32:11,426
Then we need to catch the killer

296
00:32:11,451 --> 00:32:13,625
and make him confess that
Trent is the mastermind.

297
00:32:14,429 --> 00:32:16,723
Who killed my daughter?

298
00:32:17,092 --> 00:32:20,627
I need to seek justice
for my daughter's murder.

299
00:32:20,652 --> 00:32:22,838
I know where you're
coming from, Ma'am.

300
00:32:22,863 --> 00:32:25,609
We're doing everything.

301
00:32:25,634 --> 00:32:28,888
Let us handle this.

302
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,700
You idiots!

303
00:32:58,908 --> 00:33:00,859
We're the only ones left here.

304
00:33:01,151 --> 00:33:03,237
The rest have already gone home.

305
00:33:04,242 --> 00:33:07,289
Armand, have the agents
given you the crime scene photos yet?

306
00:33:08,742 --> 00:33:10,906
Not yet, but...

307
00:33:13,735 --> 00:33:16,071
they'll hand them to
me tomorrow, for sure.

308
00:33:16,416 --> 00:33:17,416
Okay.

309
00:33:21,605 --> 00:33:24,066
Let's have a drink? Two bottles?

310
00:33:27,413 --> 00:33:28,706
I'm busy.

311
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:34,768
I said two bottles. That means
we'll have one each.

312
00:33:39,606 --> 00:33:40,860
Please?

313
00:33:42,484 --> 00:33:46,280
It's just a friendly date, okay?

314
00:33:46,719 --> 00:33:52,411
Friends? That's so high school!
Don't you want to level up?

315
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,781
Okay, fine. I'll just get my things.

316
00:34:01,974 --> 00:34:03,017
Are you serious?

317
00:34:03,664 --> 00:34:05,370
Yes, I am!

318
00:34:05,395 --> 00:34:06,977
I'll wait for you downstairs.

319
00:34:33,452 --> 00:34:35,454
How long was your
relationship with Em?

320
00:34:40,751 --> 00:34:42,044
Eight months.

321
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:45,505
Eight months?

322
00:34:49,251 --> 00:34:51,420
I didn't even notice.

323
00:34:51,445 --> 00:34:52,555
Wow.

324
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:56,925
You're so good at hiding.

325
00:35:01,188 --> 00:35:03,357
What else do I need to know?

326
00:35:13,867 --> 00:35:15,035
Em was pregnant.

327
00:35:16,078 --> 00:35:17,329
And you're the father?

328
00:35:18,901 --> 00:35:20,068
I don't know.

329
00:35:21,249 --> 00:35:23,078
She wanted me to own up to it,

330
00:35:24,294 --> 00:35:25,504
but I didn't want to.

331
00:35:26,418 --> 00:35:28,879
Who knows? It might be someone else's.

332
00:35:30,563 --> 00:35:31,968
Might?

333
00:35:32,552 --> 00:35:36,139
So, you're not really sure if
you're the father of the child?

334
00:35:41,404 --> 00:35:43,073
I feel guilty for what happened.

335
00:35:44,895 --> 00:35:47,564
When I last saw her,

336
00:35:49,492 --> 00:35:51,335
I pushed her to the ground.

337
00:35:54,116 --> 00:35:55,367
She was bleeding.

338
00:35:58,027 --> 00:36:01,197
What if the child died?

339
00:36:01,331 --> 00:36:04,918
Em's child would have died anyway
because she was murdered.

340
00:36:06,294 --> 00:36:08,758
That was a heartless statement.

341
00:36:09,022 --> 00:36:10,482
Why?

342
00:36:10,507 --> 00:36:13,218
Would anything change
if she was still alive?

343
00:36:16,978 --> 00:36:18,312
Right.

344
00:36:19,307 --> 00:36:20,851
She'd stay at your place.

345
00:36:21,775 --> 00:36:24,194
You'd take care of her
because she's pregnant

346
00:36:24,467 --> 00:36:26,219
and you're the father.

347
00:36:27,357 --> 00:36:30,068
And you'd protect them
like a good father.

348
00:36:34,927 --> 00:36:36,429
You know what, Trent,

349
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,620
you betrayed me.

350
00:36:42,356 --> 00:36:44,561
You even called me heartless

351
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:47,502
and that is so fucking harsh.

352
00:36:51,381 --> 00:36:52,424
I'm sorry.

353
00:36:54,551 --> 00:36:55,551
No.

354
00:36:56,011 --> 00:36:57,345
you're not.

355
00:37:00,098 --> 00:37:02,601
Get out of my car and go home.

356
00:37:18,791 --> 00:37:23,379
You know what, I have a feeling that Trent
isn't completely honest with us.

357
00:37:24,419 --> 00:37:25,837
Why do you say so?

358
00:37:27,792 --> 00:37:30,336
It seems like he knows
the guy in the sex scandal.

359
00:37:30,796 --> 00:37:32,798
Maybe he's the guy in the video.

360
00:37:35,745 --> 00:37:36,954
I doubt it.

361
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:40,972
He was confident in
showing his back tattoos.

362
00:37:40,999 --> 00:37:42,891
What if he was just bluffing?

363
00:37:45,435 --> 00:37:46,435
He wasn't.

364
00:37:46,978 --> 00:37:48,480
But he knows the guy.

365
00:37:50,471 --> 00:37:52,181
Do you want to invite
him again for questioning?

366
00:37:52,251 --> 00:37:53,378
Not yet.

367
00:37:54,216 --> 00:37:56,677
He might hide more information from us.

368
00:38:09,334 --> 00:38:10,836
Hang on.

369
00:38:24,449 --> 00:38:25,867
You're following me, aren't you?

370
00:38:25,892 --> 00:38:27,727
I knew you'd be here.

371
00:38:28,395 --> 00:38:29,688
Why are you looking for me?

372
00:38:30,313 --> 00:38:32,335
Do you want updates
on the Sameniego case?

373
00:38:32,803 --> 00:38:35,694
You went here just to
shove that in my face?

374
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:39,783
That's not what I meant, Pat.

375
00:38:40,257 --> 00:38:43,176
I know how important
this case is to you.

376
00:38:43,544 --> 00:38:46,464
That's why I'm giving you updates.

377
00:38:47,289 --> 00:38:48,665
Anyway,

378
00:38:49,499 --> 00:38:50,834
they are in Abra province.

379
00:38:51,268 --> 00:38:52,602
My informant told me

380
00:38:52,627 --> 00:38:54,379
that there is a local army

381
00:38:54,404 --> 00:38:57,782
that is being led by a local politician.

382
00:38:58,392 --> 00:38:59,893
Soon we'll raid their hideout.

383
00:38:59,965 --> 00:39:02,009
We're just waiting for the perfect time.

384
00:39:03,013 --> 00:39:04,139
Okay.

385
00:39:04,598 --> 00:39:05,598
Good luck.

386
00:39:06,057 --> 00:39:08,185
I hope you die.

387
00:39:10,103 --> 00:39:11,646
Good luck to you, too.

388
00:39:12,831 --> 00:39:16,168
I heard you are handling
the case of the infamous vlogger.

389
00:39:16,193 --> 00:39:17,819
It fits you.

390
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,071
All for show.

391
00:39:27,954 --> 00:39:31,561
Nice haircut, Armand.
You look like a ballsack.

392
00:39:32,473 --> 00:39:35,685
Fuck you, you piece of shit!

393
00:39:35,921 --> 00:39:38,381
You look like you showered with hair gel.

394
00:39:38,406 --> 00:39:39,887
Fuck this guy!

395
00:39:39,912 --> 00:39:42,165
It’s 2022, hair gel is so out!

396
00:39:48,225 --> 00:39:57,609
TRENT, INVESTIGATED BY PBI,
PROBED FOR EM CELERA'S MURDER.

397
00:40:14,668 --> 00:40:17,587
Are you Trent Martinez?

398
00:40:18,267 --> 00:40:19,185
Why?

399
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:21,754
Someone wants to talk to you.

400
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,504
I don't want to.

401
00:40:24,469 --> 00:40:26,304
Don't touch me!

402
00:41:36,374 --> 00:41:38,710
Where's that son of a bitch?

403
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:42,296
I know when he's working or not.

404
00:41:42,321 --> 00:41:43,889
I was worried, Trent.

405
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:46,024
I can't stand being away from you.

406
00:41:46,049 --> 00:41:48,608
This is where the suspect ran after Em,

407
00:41:48,633 --> 00:41:49,960
and this is where she was killed.

408
00:41:49,985 --> 00:41:52,921
Unknowingly, the suspect
left some evidence.

409
00:41:52,946 --> 00:41:54,835
Do you know who has that tattoo?

410
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,379
It was designed by an artist from Vietnam.

411
00:41:56,404 --> 00:41:57,881
He creates original
designs for his clients.

412
00:41:57,906 --> 00:42:01,710
That means the guy in the video
belongs to an elite group.

413
00:42:01,735 --> 00:42:05,421
I have something juicy for all of you.

414
00:42:06,169 --> 00:42:07,233
What could it be?

415
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:09,905
Something explosive.
