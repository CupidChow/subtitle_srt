1
00:00:02,882 --> 00:00:04,808
For sure that
is just for show!

2
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:06,481
Is it the
Samaniego gang again?

3
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:07,506
That's not my child.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,553
Take the Celera case.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,305
This sensational case
will just be easy for you.

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,499
The rope burn around her neck
indicates antemortem.

7
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:18,785
So you're not the guy
in the sex scandal?

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:19,561
It's not me.

9
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:21,371
Are you hiding something,
Mr. Carandang?

10
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,372
"I am pregnant."

11
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:23,582
It's like she wanted
to say something else.

12
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:25,042
- I don't work for free.
- Are you good?

13
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:26,006
You better confess now.

14
00:00:26,031 --> 00:00:28,503
Tell me what
keeps you up at night.

15
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:31,197
I placed it side by side
with Congressman's online posts.

16
00:00:31,222 --> 00:00:32,348
I have something for you.

17
00:00:32,373 --> 00:00:33,217
This is beautiful!

18
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:34,551
Two of them died.

19
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,344
Em was pregnant
when she was killed.

20
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:39,234
If you can cheat,
so can I.

21
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,250
You're messing with
the wrong person.

22
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:49,046
Are you going to kill me?

23
00:00:49,071 --> 00:00:50,233
Watch out!

24
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,860
It should've
just been me.

25
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:55,500
Why do I lose everyone
who are dear to me?

26
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,143
But how can we be sure
that she killed Em....

27
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,645
when we didn't even
hear her side?

28
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,634
For sure he was
killed by a syndicate.

29
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,177
They wanted
to silence him.

30
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,037
Isn't this a suicide
murder case?

31
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:03,640
I don't think so.
Sir Abel was left-handed...

32
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,505
and all of his gunshots
were on the right side.

33
00:02:07,206 --> 00:02:10,949
Only his wife can tell us
what really happened.

34
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:26,104
Oh my God, Patricia!
What happened?

35
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:28,565
Dad and I are
on our way there.

36
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:44,581
I just got home
from school.

37
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:46,432
A few minutes later,
a group of men...

38
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,800
barged into our house.

39
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,254
My dad asked me to hide.

40
00:02:51,426 --> 00:02:52,969
I didn't know why.

41
00:02:53,043 --> 00:02:54,716
I was terrified...

42
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:57,577
when they started firing
at my mom and dad.

43
00:02:58,778 --> 00:02:59,779
I couldn't take it.

44
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,347
I was forcing myself
to look at them.

45
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:06,501
Do you recognize
what the killers look like?

46
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,340
The...

47
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:14,861
The other guy...

48
00:03:15,464 --> 00:03:19,207
has a tattoo above
his elbow that says "SMGO".

49
00:03:25,417 --> 00:03:27,837
Do you know if
your dad has enemies?

50
00:03:29,128 --> 00:03:31,305
- Do you know any of them?
- That's impossible!

51
00:03:31,896 --> 00:03:36,400
My parents are kind.
No one would ever do this to them!

52
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,301
Chief...

53
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:43,223
The Esguerras
are good-natured.

54
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,767
But her dad was a...

55
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:47,685
PBI agent.

56
00:03:47,797 --> 00:03:52,588
I'm sure there are people
who harbor ill feelings towards him.

57
00:03:52,628 --> 00:03:59,712
The suspect is probably
one of the criminals he had caught.

58
00:03:59,737 --> 00:04:02,845
If it is true that he had
protected the drug lords,

59
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:14,462
then it is possible
that they had him killed.

60
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,215
My dad was never
a protector of the drug lords!

61
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,242
I know that, Patricia.

62
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,344
What I meant was....

63
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,472
it could be a probable cause.
Right, chief?

64
00:04:25,013 --> 00:04:26,465
You are right, Mr. Congressman.

65
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,936
We just need to gather
enough information

66
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,814
so we can
investigate it properly.

67
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,050
Em told me that
they were just friends.

68
00:07:00,075 --> 00:07:01,744
Until I saw her post online.

69
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,210
She was wearing a necklace
with a half heart pendant.

70
00:07:04,593 --> 00:07:07,331
She said she was looking
for the other half of it.

71
00:07:07,356 --> 00:07:09,279
Choi told me that it
was a rare brand of necklace.

72
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,639
Rare, indeed!
There are only ten of it in the world.

73
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:12,988
It was made by an Italian.

74
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:16,310
Do you think
the killer took the necklace?

75
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:43,778
What's that?

76
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,104
Why do you have this, Belinda?

77
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,608
That's a gift
from Stephen.

78
00:08:03,633 --> 00:08:06,469
Fuck, Belinda!
Em's name is engraved on it!

79
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:11,699
You're the mastermind
behind Em's murder.

80
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,953
What the hell
are you talking about?

81
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,126
You knew something
was going on...

82
00:08:19,894 --> 00:08:23,167
between Em and Stephen.

83
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,756
Are you aware...

84
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,717
that your husband
had a mistress?

85
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:34,597
Is this related to
Em Celera's case?

86
00:08:35,441 --> 00:08:37,451
Did I suspect that there
was something going on between them?

87
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:38,769
A little.

88
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,522
Of course, I thought about it.

89
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,026
I'm not that naive.

90
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:50,988
But an allegation
is useless

91
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,033
unless you have proof.

92
00:08:57,161 --> 00:09:00,456
That's why you asked someone
to spy on Stephen and Em.

93
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,123
Here...

94
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,627
- Here you go.
- Wow!

95
00:09:40,202 --> 00:09:42,554
so you could gather
enough evidence.

96
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:43,579
Ma'am...

97
00:09:44,013 --> 00:09:45,014
Here it is.

98
00:09:46,132 --> 00:09:47,937
What did you see?

99
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,925
Just check the file, ma'am.

100
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,592
Okay, fine. Thank you.

101
00:09:52,816 --> 00:09:56,904
You wanted something
to use against Stephen

102
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:02,214
so he could finally stop denying
about his affair with Em.

103
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:42,159
You couldn't stand what you saw.

104
00:11:42,184 --> 00:11:44,746
You found yourself
swallowed up by your own anger.

105
00:11:51,891 --> 00:11:57,091
DO YOU WANT TO EARN MONEY?
SHARE EM CELERA'S SEX SCANDAL.

106
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:03,030
You wanted to
get back at them.

107
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,449
But since you
love Stephen,

108
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,159
you couldn't hurt him.

109
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,979
And so you poured
all your rage on Em.

110
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:14,280
She was the reason
behind all of these.

111
00:12:14,469 --> 00:12:16,721
It was her whom you'd destroy.

112
00:12:16,746 --> 00:12:19,298
But you didn't expect that
Em would find out

113
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,585
that you spread
her sex scandal.

114
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:30,503
Only the wife of
Congressman Chuatico can do it.

115
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,429
What do you want?

116
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,824
Is it true that you spread
my sex scandal?

117
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,201
I don't know
what you're talking about.

118
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,660
You better leave.

119
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,425
Or else I will sue you
for alarm and scandal.

120
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:56,108
How about I sue you?

121
00:12:57,572 --> 00:12:59,628
I'm already discussing
with my lawyers...

122
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,530
on what case should
be filed against you.

123
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,657
This is pointless.

124
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,409
I'm not done with you yet!

125
00:13:05,434 --> 00:13:09,020
How dare you touch me,
you mistress!

126
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,873
And so it's out in the open!

127
00:13:13,563 --> 00:13:15,565
You knew about
my affair with Stephen.

128
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:20,341
I have a better news for you.
I am pregnant.

129
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,303
And I know Stephen
will be happy once he finds out.

130
00:13:25,937 --> 00:13:28,800
- Why are you telling me this?
- So you can prepare yourself.

131
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:34,753
You know that Stephen
will choose our baby over you.

132
00:13:54,816 --> 00:13:57,002
That's why she confroted
you about it.

133
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,120
She told you that
she was pregnant.

134
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,817
And we both know...

135
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:06,071
how badly Stephen wants
to have another child.

136
00:14:06,995 --> 00:14:08,722
And so you got terrified.

137
00:14:11,573 --> 00:14:14,245
Hello, everyone!
Hello, Em nation!

138
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,164
Your bubbly Em is back

139
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,667
and we are
stronger than ever!

140
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:23,487
I have a surprise for you!

141
00:14:23,512 --> 00:14:26,382
It's something explosive!

142
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:30,792
That's why to my Em nation,
just keep in touch!

143
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,840
You had her killed.

144
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,595
Who did you
ask to kill Em?

145
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,434
Answer me, Belinda!

146
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,811
Who killed Em?!

147
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:42,650
It was Roger.

148
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,110
I knew it!

149
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,822
When I saw the knot
around the tree,

150
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:53,035
I knew Mr. Roger
was the one who did it.

151
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,206
It looks nice, doesn't it?

152
00:15:57,231 --> 00:15:58,638
Hey, Mr. Roger.

153
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,878
I was left with no choice.

154
00:16:03,428 --> 00:16:06,139
What if she told
Stephen the truth

155
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:10,377
that she was pregnant
with their child?

156
00:16:11,146 --> 00:16:12,690
But Belinda,

157
00:16:13,716 --> 00:16:15,779
he still left you.

158
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:22,272
Do you even think
about what you did?

159
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:26,860
So what?

160
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:28,945
then...

161
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,699
You'll call the police?

162
00:16:32,528 --> 00:16:33,904
You'll have me arrested?

163
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:35,948
Your best friend?

164
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:40,621
All this time,

165
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,175
whenever there is a lead
that points to you,

166
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:46,104
I just turn a blind eye.

167
00:16:46,276 --> 00:16:48,924
I know someone
who could possibly do it.

168
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,926
The congressman's wife,

169
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,303
Belinda De Dios.

170
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,807
Belinda will never do that.

171
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,725
That's not who she is.

172
00:16:58,159 --> 00:16:59,439
She's a De Dios.

173
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,229
I always tell myself

174
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:04,128
that you will never do that.

175
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,904
That you're incapable
of murdering someone.

176
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,388
But I can't take this anymore,
Belinda.

177
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,582
I can't let this pass.

178
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:24,011
Patricia...

179
00:18:28,132 --> 00:18:29,441
Roger!

180
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,906
Roger...

181
00:19:12,846 --> 00:19:14,585
Roger!

182
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,502
Belinda!

183
00:19:26,527 --> 00:19:29,088
Stop it!
That's enough!

184
00:19:41,478 --> 00:19:43,752
- I'll get jailed!
- No, you won't!

185
00:19:44,745 --> 00:19:48,385
I will!

186
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,455
No one will get jailed!

187
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,549
I won't abandon you.

188
00:20:14,912 --> 00:20:17,165
About what you
witnessed today...

189
00:20:17,364 --> 00:20:21,034
You know that Belinda
doesn't really act like that.

190
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,891
She was just
trying to save you.

191
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:30,479
I'm sure you
wouldn't want her jailed, right?

192
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,720
But are you aware...

193
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,943
that Belinda had Em killed?

194
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,654
Does that even matter?

195
00:20:40,726 --> 00:20:42,472
What matters is
that we know...

196
00:20:43,456 --> 00:20:47,441
where she is coming from.

197
00:20:58,986 --> 00:21:00,285
You know

198
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:05,495
I treated you as my own child.

199
00:21:05,661 --> 00:21:07,407
I'm sure

200
00:21:08,355 --> 00:21:10,602
you'll take care of Belinda.

201
00:21:12,366 --> 00:21:15,578
I hope you continue to protect her.

202
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:21,363
I'll make sure
you're properly rewarded.

203
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,703
There's no need for that, sir.

204
00:21:30,098 --> 00:21:31,474
Just like what I always do.

205
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,462
I won't let Belinda
get in trouble.

206
00:21:44,312 --> 00:21:47,315
We have to
stick together...

207
00:21:49,234 --> 00:21:51,855
like family.

208
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,762
Are you happy?

209
00:22:40,898 --> 00:22:42,051
If you're not,

210
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,773
then do what
will make you happy.

211
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:48,927
Dad...

212
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:54,419
I hope you're proud of me.

213
00:22:55,412 --> 00:22:57,414
We're almost there.

214
00:22:58,853 --> 00:23:00,786
I won't let you go.

215
00:23:05,187 --> 00:23:07,022
I will do everything.

216
00:23:07,998 --> 00:23:10,020
I promise you.

217
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,011
Ma'am?

218
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,727
Good morning, Ma'am!

219
00:24:38,752 --> 00:24:42,255
- I won't eat breakfast...
- Ma'am, you have a delivery.

220
00:24:42,462 --> 00:24:43,464
Just receive it for me.

221
00:24:43,489 --> 00:24:45,684
I think it's you who
should receive it, ma'am.

222
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:59,176
Ma'am! Here it is!

223
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,338
It looks expensive!

224
00:25:33,249 --> 00:25:34,249
Hello.

225
00:25:35,182 --> 00:25:37,573
So, do you like it?

226
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:42,874
You can exchange it for
another color if you want to.

227
00:25:42,899 --> 00:25:45,001
Belinda was the one
who chose that color.

228
00:25:45,026 --> 00:25:48,432
Thank you, Mr. Senator,
but I don't need this.

229
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,899
I insist.

230
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:55,095
That's nothing compared to
what you've done for my daughter.

231
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:02,035
Regarding the promotion
that you've been eyeing,

232
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,104
I'll take care of it as well.

233
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:05,159
Okay?

234
00:26:05,822 --> 00:26:08,542
Mr. Senator, you don't
have to meddle with it.

235
00:26:09,573 --> 00:26:12,612
Belinda was right,
you'd resist.

236
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:16,383
But before you completely say no,
I'll hang up.

237
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,018
- Goodbye!
- But Mr. Sen...

238
00:27:25,314 --> 00:27:29,444
Wow!
What a beautiful car!

239
00:27:29,469 --> 00:27:32,025
It looks so clean!

240
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:35,059
As clean as the
owner's conscience!

241
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:37,322
How much did you pay for it?

242
00:27:39,645 --> 00:27:41,076
Why aren't you answering?

243
00:27:41,375 --> 00:27:42,375
Hey!

244
00:27:42,942 --> 00:27:44,694
Our boss is waiting for you.

245
00:27:45,572 --> 00:27:46,572
When does he need me?

246
00:27:46,597 --> 00:27:47,597
Right now.

247
00:27:48,726 --> 00:27:49,726
Come on.

248
00:27:50,213 --> 00:27:51,213
Let's go.

249
00:27:53,084 --> 00:27:56,543
Your car looks nice.
It's a very generous gift.

250
00:27:57,269 --> 00:27:58,566
Thank you, sir.

251
00:27:58,879 --> 00:28:01,598
I'm sure you already know
why I called you up.

252
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,418
Actually, I don't.

253
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,646
Well, I have another
generous gift for you.

254
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:19,197
Congratulations, Head Agent Esguerra!

255
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:22,951
Why the long face?

256
00:28:23,581 --> 00:28:25,499
Are you not happy
with the promotion?

257
00:28:27,718 --> 00:28:28,718
No, sir.

258
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:34,629
Actually, I've been working
so hard for this.

259
00:28:36,062 --> 00:28:39,968
I just didn't expect that
I would get it too soon.

260
00:28:39,993 --> 00:28:41,710
You deserve it!

261
00:28:41,844 --> 00:28:43,404
Are you going to tell
the team about it?

262
00:28:43,434 --> 00:28:46,124
Should they expect a dinner treat?

263
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:48,593
Sir, can we not
tell them yet?

264
00:28:49,873 --> 00:28:52,726
I still need to
digest this promotion.

265
00:28:52,751 --> 00:28:56,129
Sure! We'll just announce it
by the end of the week.

266
00:28:59,633 --> 00:29:02,469
- Thank you, sir.
- Congratulations again.

267
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,750
Hey!

268
00:29:13,092 --> 00:29:15,466
My dad told me
about your promotion.

269
00:29:15,632 --> 00:29:17,046
Congratulations!

270
00:29:17,327 --> 00:29:18,899
Thank you, Belinda.

271
00:29:19,148 --> 00:29:21,067
I was supposed
to call you earlier

272
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:24,429
but I've been busy
with a lot of things.

273
00:29:24,454 --> 00:29:26,456
And what are those things?

274
00:29:26,481 --> 00:29:28,835
I'm packing my bags.

275
00:29:29,742 --> 00:29:32,312
Oh, shit.
Haven't I told you?

276
00:29:32,851 --> 00:29:35,093
Why? Where are you going?

277
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:36,816
I'm going to London.

278
00:29:37,452 --> 00:29:39,149
And then after a month,

279
00:29:39,174 --> 00:29:40,527
to Portugal.

280
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,046
We'll probably see each other again
after a month.

281
00:29:43,546 --> 00:29:44,899
Really?

282
00:29:44,924 --> 00:29:46,507
When is your flight?

283
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,286
Tomorrow.

284
00:29:49,764 --> 00:29:50,970
Why....

285
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,804
Why the rush?

286
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,109
Why does it seem
so well-planned?

287
00:29:55,134 --> 00:29:56,811
Gosh!

288
00:29:56,836 --> 00:30:01,132
If I won't leave the country
or this house,

289
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:03,535
I'd go crazy.

290
00:30:05,967 --> 00:30:07,346
Does Stephen know?

291
00:30:07,371 --> 00:30:08,514
What for?

292
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,185
He tried calling me

293
00:30:12,888 --> 00:30:13,888
but...

294
00:30:14,749 --> 00:30:17,828
I'm over it.
I don't want him anymore.

295
00:30:17,945 --> 00:30:20,084
May he rot in hell!

296
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,695
I have to go, girl.

297
00:30:23,101 --> 00:30:25,057
I still have to
run some errands.

298
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,741
I'll see you soon.

299
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,900
Bye!

300
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:48,721
One bottle of beer, please.

301
00:30:58,314 --> 00:30:59,649
How have you been?

302
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,736
Do you still have wounds?

303
00:31:04,185 --> 00:31:05,352
I'm getting better.

304
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,410
How about you?
How have you been?

305
00:31:11,024 --> 00:31:12,692
I heard that you
just got promoted.

306
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,832
Who told you?

307
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,309
Wanda?

308
00:31:21,082 --> 00:31:24,048
I thought you broke up already.

309
00:31:24,637 --> 00:31:25,805
Well...

310
00:31:26,512 --> 00:31:28,556
We're keeping in touch.

311
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,478
How's the Samaniego case?

312
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,106
They already closed the case.

313
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,650
No one wanted
to testify anymore.

314
00:31:44,148 --> 00:31:48,069
Bullshit! I can't even
get justice for my troop.

315
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,116
Now you know

316
00:31:52,002 --> 00:31:54,641
how it feels to chase that gang.

317
00:32:05,224 --> 00:32:07,810
I'm sorry for
what happened to Choi.

318
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:12,096
I was their target.

319
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,713
I heard some insider
info about it.

320
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:24,108
You've been
a pain in the ass

321
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:27,068
because you refuse to let go
of the Samaniego case.

322
00:32:28,721 --> 00:32:31,824
Looks like you
annoyed their leader.

323
00:32:32,253 --> 00:32:34,260
Take care of yourself.

324
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,204
You have no idea
who you are messing with.

325
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,629
I'll go ahead.

326
00:32:44,854 --> 00:32:46,064
We might get caught.

327
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,529
They might think that
we are talking about the Samaniego case.

328
00:32:49,424 --> 00:32:50,792
Take care.

329
00:32:52,274 --> 00:32:53,274
You too.

330
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:19,640
If you'd get reincarnated,
what animal would you like to be?

331
00:34:19,665 --> 00:34:20,974
A cat.

332
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,228
Why?

333
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,397
Nothing.

334
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,612
I'm tired of being a lapdog.

335
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,924
You always joke around.

336
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:40,261
I thought the people I was loyal to
were also loyal to me.

337
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:41,799
But...

338
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:46,948
they treated me like a dog.

339
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:52,393
They wanted me to be loyal
to them like a dog.

340
00:34:56,803 --> 00:35:01,073
Oftentimes, I'd question
my place in their life

341
00:35:01,098 --> 00:35:03,226
because...

342
00:35:05,292 --> 00:35:07,706
I'd end up being degraded.

343
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:15,530
I would like to be a bat.

344
00:35:15,971 --> 00:35:19,408
Bats have a strong
sense of hearing.

345
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:23,838
I want to hear
people's hearts.

346
00:35:23,863 --> 00:35:26,801
I want to know
if they are really happy

347
00:35:26,826 --> 00:35:29,912
or just faking it
when they are with me.

348
00:35:32,077 --> 00:35:33,077
Me,

349
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,134
I am happy
when I am with you.

350
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,506
Your timing is perfect!

351
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:01,200
Congressman Chuatico's
murder case is assigned to us.

352
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:05,596
I'm sorry but
I won't take the case.

353
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,050
I'll just inform our boss
about my decision.

354
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,251
But why?

355
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:13,754
This case is too personal to me.

356
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:18,291
I don't want to be biased
during the investigation.

357
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:20,961
I get your point,
but you're passing up an opportunity.

358
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,015
Don't worry,

359
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:26,934
I will tell our boss to make you
the lead agent of the case.

360
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:29,112
and to give you
the same team.

361
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,479
Don't bother.

362
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:33,040
You'll do good in this case.

363
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:36,335
I'll do good. Good is even better.

364
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,403
Come on, man.

365
00:36:47,259 --> 00:36:48,510
Who's that from?

366
00:36:48,535 --> 00:36:50,829
I have no idea, ma'am.

367
00:36:50,854 --> 00:36:54,207
I've been here the whole day
but I didn't even notice...

368
00:36:54,232 --> 00:36:55,984
who delivered it.

369
00:36:56,225 --> 00:36:57,625
- I'll take care of this.
- Alright.

370
00:37:09,753 --> 00:37:10,753
Patricia,

371
00:37:10,781 --> 00:37:14,354
I would've been dead already
by the time you receive this flashdrive.

372
00:37:14,759 --> 00:37:21,239
There are important files in this drive
that can help you in your search for truth.

373
00:37:41,298 --> 00:37:44,557
All the documents and videos
came from my dad.

374
00:37:44,582 --> 00:37:48,635
He was a police and
Pio's secret secondhand man.

375
00:37:49,366 --> 00:37:54,439
You'll see how Pio ordered to
include your dad's name in the drug matrix

376
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,067
so he could have a reason
to have him killed.

377
00:38:00,482 --> 00:38:02,401
That's not possible,
Congressman De Dios.

378
00:38:03,109 --> 00:38:04,819
We talked about it clearly.

379
00:38:05,861 --> 00:38:07,837
If it involves illegal drugs,

380
00:38:10,033 --> 00:38:11,284
I'll pass.

381
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:14,916
And now we're talking
about a large supply?!

382
00:38:48,415 --> 00:38:51,501
Fuck that Esguerra.

383
00:38:52,573 --> 00:38:54,492
Does he think
he is powerful now?

384
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:59,439
He should be
taught a lesson.

385
00:39:14,211 --> 00:39:16,713
I'll let you handle Esguerra.

386
00:39:17,418 --> 00:39:24,013
He's in charge of your
gang's case, anyway.

387
00:39:25,077 --> 00:39:29,582
Just make sure that
his child isn't there

388
00:39:29,607 --> 00:39:32,616
once you kill
him and his wife.

389
00:39:33,124 --> 00:39:34,918
And then make it appear like

390
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:37,204
it's your syndicate's own doing.

391
00:39:38,887 --> 00:39:39,887
Alright, sir.

392
00:39:40,806 --> 00:39:41,806
Good.

393
00:39:52,442 --> 00:39:53,693
You know

394
00:39:53,718 --> 00:39:58,515
I treated you as
my own child.

395
00:40:06,287 --> 00:40:13,794
We need to stick together
like family.

396
00:42:11,315 --> 00:42:13,067
Come in, ma'am.

397
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,840
Sir, you have a visitor.

398
00:42:19,099 --> 00:42:21,204
Hey, Patricia!

399
00:42:21,229 --> 00:42:23,440
Come in!

400
00:42:24,524 --> 00:42:25,775
What brings you here?

401
00:42:26,427 --> 00:42:28,731
What's up?
Good thing you're here.

402
00:42:28,848 --> 00:42:31,184
Belinda called me last night.

403
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:33,491
She told me that
she missed home already.

404
00:42:33,598 --> 00:42:35,141
Did she call you, too?

405
00:42:35,637 --> 00:42:37,772
Good thing
you're not busy in PBI

406
00:42:37,797 --> 00:42:41,384
with all the responsibilites
in your new position.

407
00:42:45,642 --> 00:42:46,935
Take a seat.

408
00:42:53,942 --> 00:42:57,070
Let's talk about your concern.
Is that about a case?

409
00:42:57,095 --> 00:42:58,095
Yes, it is.

410
00:42:59,637 --> 00:43:00,637
A new one?

411
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,335
Your boss didn't inform me.

412
00:43:05,098 --> 00:43:06,517
It's an old case.

413
00:43:07,004 --> 00:43:09,548
But I am sure you'll be able
to help me with this.

414
00:43:10,419 --> 00:43:12,547
Sure! Let me see.

415
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:47,162
What's the meaning of this, Patricia?

416
00:43:48,873 --> 00:43:53,161
I know you ordered
the Samaniego group to kill my parents.

417
00:43:55,544 --> 00:43:56,712
Patricia,

418
00:43:57,474 --> 00:43:59,852
let's talk things out.

419
00:44:03,252 --> 00:44:07,340
I don't like it when someone
gets in my way.

420
00:44:07,365 --> 00:44:08,943
I have my reasons!

421
00:44:10,435 --> 00:44:11,895
You are evil!

422
00:44:20,662 --> 00:44:25,599
Do you know how much it hurt for a child
to see her parents get killed?

423
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:33,904
Do you know how hard
life has been for me

424
00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:37,704
and my mom

425
00:44:38,392 --> 00:44:41,068
because of what you did?

426
00:44:42,357 --> 00:44:44,443
You weren't supposed to be there.

427
00:44:45,113 --> 00:44:47,783
Belinda told me
that you were still in school.

428
00:44:49,194 --> 00:44:50,612
Do you think...

429
00:44:51,654 --> 00:44:53,896
you can console me?

430
00:44:54,888 --> 00:44:57,891
I sent you to school, Patricia.

431
00:45:00,647 --> 00:45:03,904
I gave you
everything you need.

432
00:45:05,033 --> 00:45:06,284
Everything.

433
00:45:08,243 --> 00:45:12,455
- I treated you as my own daughter.
- Daughter?

434
00:45:14,415 --> 00:45:16,292
I am not your daughter.

435
00:45:17,627 --> 00:45:23,466
I will never forgive you.

436
00:45:35,687 --> 00:45:37,272
Patricia,

437
00:45:38,147 --> 00:45:39,274
please...

438
00:45:52,529 --> 00:45:54,322
Do you know what you deserve?

439
00:45:56,961 --> 00:45:58,879
A shot in the head!
