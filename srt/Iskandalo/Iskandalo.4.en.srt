1
00:00:03,586 --> 00:00:05,797
Where is that son of a bitch?

2
00:00:05,822 --> 00:00:07,257
I need to do this, Mom.

3
00:00:07,282 --> 00:00:08,233
Can I talk to you?

4
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:09,910
Are you courting my wife?

5
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:11,736
And that's where she was killed.

6
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:13,822
That's what tree surgeons use.

7
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,241
May we invite you
for questioning, Mr. Carandang?

8
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:18,382
Are you hiding something,
Mr. Carandang?

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,495
Do you think Uncle Joel
is stealing from me?

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,330
Since then she had been spying on me.

11
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,958
Until she discovered
that I've been having an affair.

12
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,609
Enough with the drama.

13
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:27,736
Release him now!

14
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:29,571
We need to set Joel free.

15
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:30,530
I'm pregnant,

16
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,282
and I will let the public
know about this.

17
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:19,115
LET'S MEET.

18
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:02,425
Everybody out.

19
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,270
Please leave this room to us.

20
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,418
What brings you here?

21
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,536
After all these years--

22
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:31,604
Shut up.

23
00:04:33,145 --> 00:04:33,815
Dad,

24
00:04:34,145 --> 00:04:35,101
relax.

25
00:04:36,612 --> 00:04:38,345
If you want to fool around,

26
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,073
do not rub it in your wife's face.

27
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,009
I don't have an affair, Dad.

28
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:46,895
Don't lie to me.

29
00:04:48,741 --> 00:04:51,077
I've always known
you're an asshole,

30
00:04:51,637 --> 00:04:53,848
even before my daughter married you.

31
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,321
But I let it slide

32
00:04:56,707 --> 00:04:57,798
and let it pass

33
00:04:58,763 --> 00:05:00,133
because she loves you.

34
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:06,206
Maybe my daughter
is a sucker for bastards.

35
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,142
Stop saying those things, Dad.

36
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,296
Don't ever hurt my daughter.

37
00:05:13,807 --> 00:05:14,981
Do you understand?

38
00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:16,733
Just make her happy

39
00:05:17,018 --> 00:05:18,677
and we're good.

40
00:05:19,475 --> 00:05:20,684
Have an affair--

41
00:05:20,991 --> 00:05:22,659
I don't give a damn.

42
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,743
Even if you're now a congressman,

43
00:05:27,532 --> 00:05:28,867
always remember

44
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:34,901
that this hand is still
the same hand that feeds you.

45
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:39,906
If I see Belinda crying again,

46
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:45,678
I'll make sure you lose
everything you have.

47
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:07,117
Hello. Hi.

48
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,786
You were looking for me? I'm Choi.

49
00:06:13,028 --> 00:06:13,999
Choi?

50
00:06:14,482 --> 00:06:15,542
Are you Chinese?

51
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:17,878
Are you racist?

52
00:06:18,227 --> 00:06:19,242
Stop that.

53
00:06:21,354 --> 00:06:22,340
I'm Patricia.

54
00:06:23,131 --> 00:06:23,925
I'm Choi.

55
00:06:25,632 --> 00:06:28,638
I'm sorry.
I'm just really confused...

56
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,432
and curious, actually.

57
00:06:31,995 --> 00:06:33,727
Don't you have other things to do?

58
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,687
I just wanted to help
and then you called me.

59
00:06:36,712 --> 00:06:38,481
-  Are you probing me?
- No, no.

60
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,442
We just want to know

61
00:06:41,113 --> 00:06:43,361
why you are so invested in Em's case.

62
00:06:43,688 --> 00:06:45,639
A lot of trolls have been
flooding us with information,

63
00:06:46,282 --> 00:06:48,116
but there is something different about you.

64
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,311
First of all, I'm serious

65
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,189
because I wanted to help
and you asked me to.

66
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,708
Firstly, I'm not a troll.

67
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:57,792
I'm a web sleuth.

68
00:06:59,395 --> 00:07:00,253
Web sleuth.

69
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,548
How did the police catch
Luka Magnotta, the cat killer?

70
00:07:03,573 --> 00:07:04,674
Right, the cat killer!

71
00:07:04,844 --> 00:07:05,800
Who is he?

72
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,888
You're such a dumbass!

73
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,223
I've been helping you out
with your cases

74
00:07:12,248 --> 00:07:13,183
without your knowledge.

75
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,396
Hey!

76
00:07:18,549 --> 00:07:19,856
Listen...

77
00:07:20,267 --> 00:07:22,186
If you want to get
involved in our investigations,

78
00:07:22,211 --> 00:07:24,527
you better talk to me properly.

79
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,863
Does that mean I'm hired?

80
00:07:27,576 --> 00:07:28,615
Today is my first day

81
00:07:28,702 --> 00:07:29,783
and I don't work for free.

82
00:07:29,941 --> 00:07:30,951
Are you good?

83
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:32,786
At what?

84
00:07:42,471 --> 00:07:45,423
Are you sure we'll leave this to Choi?

85
00:07:45,654 --> 00:07:48,009
We'll leave it up to a fan boy?

86
00:07:48,366 --> 00:07:49,344
Don't worry,

87
00:07:49,747 --> 00:07:53,206
I didn't ask him to gather
confidential information.

88
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,809
But if he chances upon
a significant lead,

89
00:07:56,177 --> 00:07:57,560
then that's when we play it safe.

90
00:07:58,304 --> 00:08:00,063
Besides, fans are loyal.

91
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,716
They devote time to their idols.

92
00:08:03,386 --> 00:08:06,344
So do not underestimate a fan's obsession.

93
00:08:06,848 --> 00:08:08,905
Do you think Ma'am Elaine

94
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,907
will still allow us
to investigate at the wake

95
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,268
after what we've done to Joel?

96
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,396
Of course. We're just doing our job.

97
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,458
Hey, why are
you driving this way?

98
00:08:20,483 --> 00:08:22,068
The funeral home is that way!

99
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,005
Let's take a detour first.

100
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:31,402
Good day, sir!

101
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,330
Good day to you, too!

102
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,864
Good day, sir.

103
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,140
It was us whom you
talked to the last time.

104
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,292
Okay, here's the thing:

105
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,187
This was days before
Em's body was found.

106
00:08:41,546 --> 00:08:44,174
But I'm not saying
the she is the killer.

107
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:48,092
It seemed like she was
figuring out her way in.

108
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,363
HOW MUCH FOR A POP?

109
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,156
GOOD GAME, IDOL!

110
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:57,203
DIDN'T KNOW YOU'RE A HOOKER.
I'LL SAVE UP SO I CAN HIRE YOU.

111
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:00,414
JUST ONE TIME!

112
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,209
I'M SURE THIS ISN'T YOUR FIRST!

113
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,711
CAN I BE NEXT?

114
00:09:32,585 --> 00:09:33,907
Did she have a companion?

115
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,492
No. She was alone.

116
00:09:35,572 --> 00:09:37,577
My co-patroller saw her.

117
00:09:37,602 --> 00:09:38,828
Good thing she was caught.

118
00:09:39,224 --> 00:09:40,914
Hey, don't move!

119
00:09:41,069 --> 00:09:42,248
This is a private farm.

120
00:09:42,273 --> 00:09:43,708
What are you doing here?

121
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:44,709
Where was she?

122
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:47,895
We let her go
because she didn't commit a crime.

123
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,673
Can you still recognize the guy?

124
00:09:50,773 --> 00:09:51,732
The guy?

125
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,327
She's a girl! Here, take a look...

126
00:09:55,902 --> 00:09:56,888
There she is.

127
00:10:03,641 --> 00:10:05,021
What now?

128
00:10:05,407 --> 00:10:06,564
Do you want us to file charges?

129
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,108
She was trespassing.

130
00:10:08,164 --> 00:10:09,259
No need, sir.

131
00:10:10,312 --> 00:10:11,569
Just let her be.

132
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:15,531
But please don't tell
Mom about this.

133
00:10:15,912 --> 00:10:17,784
Alright, if you say so.

134
00:10:17,932 --> 00:10:19,452
Were you able  to get her name?

135
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:21,621
We weren't able to.

136
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:56,264
Do you already have
an idea on who that girl is?

137
00:10:58,745 --> 00:11:00,101
This is such a curveball.

138
00:11:01,385 --> 00:11:03,346
We started by looking
for a tattooed guy.

139
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,648
Now we're looking
for a stalker girl.

140
00:11:06,461 --> 00:11:08,839
I don't know where
this case is headed.

141
00:11:14,804 --> 00:11:17,202
Excuse me, I'll go ahead.

142
00:11:19,834 --> 00:11:21,139
Thank you.

143
00:11:21,164 --> 00:11:22,165
Thank you.

144
00:11:29,195 --> 00:11:30,173
Hang on.

145
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,234
Stephen...

146
00:11:35,616 --> 00:11:36,446
Hey.

147
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,184
I didn't know you were here.

148
00:11:41,687 --> 00:11:42,507
No.

149
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,980
I just arrived.
I'm with my team.

150
00:11:46,995 --> 00:11:48,249
Are you with Belinda?

151
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,127
Isn't she close to Em?

152
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:53,671
Is she not interested?

153
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:59,802
Why don't you ask her?

154
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,888
You're best friends, right?

155
00:12:01,913 --> 00:12:03,014
And you are her husband.

156
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,917
You know what,

157
00:12:07,322 --> 00:12:10,255
I don't really get why
you became best friends.

158
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,274
You have different interests.

159
00:12:13,508 --> 00:12:16,219
I also don't know why

160
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,238
she chose to marry you.

161
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,349
I know you know why.

162
00:12:22,739 --> 00:12:23,907
What do you want?

163
00:12:25,807 --> 00:12:27,605
I'm not like my wife.

164
00:12:27,764 --> 00:12:29,649
I don't have time for chit-chat.

165
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,236
For someone who doesn't
have much time,

166
00:12:34,081 --> 00:12:36,875
why are you so
hands-on with this case?

167
00:12:39,923 --> 00:12:40,765
Wait...

168
00:12:42,264 --> 00:12:43,429
Is this a joke?

169
00:12:45,334 --> 00:12:46,166
What's this?

170
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,835
Am I a suspect now?

171
00:12:50,221 --> 00:12:53,256
Well, to tell you honestly,
I am indebted to Em.

172
00:12:56,403 --> 00:12:57,527
Because of her,

173
00:12:58,155 --> 00:12:59,804
my exposure widened.

174
00:13:00,688 --> 00:13:02,640
She helped me with my campaigns

175
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:05,118
and advocacies.

176
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,312
I think

177
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,232
it isn't wrong to grieve
over a friend's death

178
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,819
and to seek justice for her.

179
00:13:15,192 --> 00:13:16,504
Was Em your mistress?

180
00:13:17,884 --> 00:13:18,740
No.

181
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,869
I'm sorry.

182
00:13:24,939 --> 00:13:26,414
I'm just concerned with Belinda.

183
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,200
You cheated on her once.

184
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,126
How about me?

185
00:13:32,642 --> 00:13:34,297
What do you know
about our relationship?

186
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:41,471
Fuck!

187
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:46,643
I don't know why everyone
wants to meddle in my personal life.

188
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:49,354
Please, Stephen.

189
00:13:49,599 --> 00:13:50,624
I'm asking you

190
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:54,792
to not add to the pain
that Belinda is going through right now.

191
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,653
Are we done here?

192
00:14:20,368 --> 00:14:21,578
Where is Armand?

193
00:14:21,753 --> 00:14:22,963
He is drinking coffee over there.

194
00:14:58,816 --> 00:14:59,941
Freeze!

195
00:15:07,444 --> 00:15:08,345
Get in.

196
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,166
What are you doing here?

197
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,713
Nothing.

198
00:16:04,677 --> 00:16:05,965
I just want to make it up to you.

199
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,967
For forgetting our anniversary.

200
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,953
Remember our night in Paris?

201
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:16,459
Let's have champagne,

202
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,129
so we can

203
00:16:23,225 --> 00:16:26,052
rekindle the honeymoon we had before.

204
00:16:28,713 --> 00:16:30,765
Were you spying on Em?

205
00:16:32,771 --> 00:16:34,435
Were you Em's stalker?

206
00:16:39,961 --> 00:16:41,734
Armand, did you get her ID?

207
00:16:44,891 --> 00:16:45,880
Yes, I did.

208
00:16:46,822 --> 00:16:48,074
Agatha David.

209
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:05,942
Agatha?

210
00:17:06,389 --> 00:17:07,610
Is that your real name?

211
00:17:09,426 --> 00:17:10,488
Speak now.

212
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,350
We have ways to confirm

213
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,978
if you're the same girl
they caught that night.

214
00:17:18,644 --> 00:17:20,648
We're making things easier for you.

215
00:17:52,188 --> 00:17:54,356
I've been to their farmhouse

216
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,868
a couple of times already.

217
00:17:58,367 --> 00:18:00,371
I just wanted to see her

218
00:18:01,585 --> 00:18:02,899
and check if she's okay.

219
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:06,569
I wanted to know
why she disappeared

220
00:18:06,642 --> 00:18:08,838
when her sex scandal
went viral.

221
00:18:10,544 --> 00:18:12,300
Hey, don't move!

222
00:18:12,505 --> 00:18:13,759
This is a private farm.

223
00:18:14,133 --> 00:18:16,078
The last time I went there,

224
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,664
the patrollers caught me.

225
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,935
I never went back since.

226
00:18:43,543 --> 00:18:44,624
It's Philip.

227
00:18:45,268 --> 00:18:46,167
We're dead.

228
00:18:47,847 --> 00:18:48,812
Sorry.

229
00:18:51,205 --> 00:18:52,949
Is it haunting you again?

230
00:18:57,841 --> 00:18:59,843
Do you want us to
undergo counseling?

231
00:19:02,072 --> 00:19:03,084
Not yet.

232
00:19:03,483 --> 00:19:04,752
I'm not yet ready.

233
00:19:06,538 --> 00:19:08,130
Tell me when you're ready.

234
00:19:31,493 --> 00:19:32,421
Look..

235
00:19:33,122 --> 00:19:34,757
Look at the mess
you've caused.

236
00:19:35,023 --> 00:19:36,441
Why did you initiate
a sloppy operation

237
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,818
instead of following
our protocol?

238
00:19:38,069 --> 00:19:40,371
Care to explain?

239
00:19:40,856 --> 00:19:41,889
Armand,

240
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:45,701
you weren't in the video
but you were inside the vehicle.

241
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:48,979
I can't just leave my partner, sir.

242
00:19:49,048 --> 00:19:50,815
Fine! Go through hell with her!

243
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:51,815
And you, Esguerra.

244
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,567
What has gotten into you?

245
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,477
When you recruited
Choi to join the team,

246
00:19:56,502 --> 00:20:00,558
I didn't object even though
we both know that it isn't allowed.

247
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,926
I let it pass because I trust you.

248
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:05,287
Choi is good.
He is an asset to the team.

249
00:20:05,312 --> 00:20:05,988
I know.

250
00:20:06,013 --> 00:20:08,015
But this time,
you assaulted an innocent girl.

251
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,558
What the hell was that, Patricia?

252
00:20:09,652 --> 00:20:11,894
We have reasons for doing it.

253
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,231
Of course, you do!
But that is outside the protocol!

254
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,174
I'm sorry, chief.

255
00:20:17,619 --> 00:20:18,951
Whatever.

256
00:20:31,753 --> 00:20:32,648
Trent?

257
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,275
Trent...

258
00:20:35,822 --> 00:20:37,345
I need to talk to you.

259
00:20:39,133 --> 00:20:40,448
What do you want?

260
00:20:43,729 --> 00:20:45,978
My relationship with Em
is all over the news.

261
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:49,665
It was supposed to be
a secret relationship.

262
00:20:49,938 --> 00:20:51,067
Strictly confidential.

263
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,714
Her death has been
giving me nothing but problems.

264
00:20:56,739 --> 00:20:59,242
How dare you make this about you?

265
00:21:00,284 --> 00:21:01,952
If you had just used your head,

266
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,080
and owned up to your mistake,

267
00:21:04,614 --> 00:21:06,499
Em would've been alive today.

268
00:21:07,146 --> 00:21:09,960
You wouldn't have problems.

269
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,899
Who did that to you?

270
00:21:15,727 --> 00:21:17,568
Fuck you! Who are you, my mom?!

271
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,096
I'm serious, Trent.

272
00:21:20,942 --> 00:21:23,182
If somebody's out there to kill you,

273
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:25,425
then let's file a case on him.

274
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,243
You know what,

275
00:21:26,524 --> 00:21:27,770
I don't want any trouble anymore.

276
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,492
I just want to sleep soundly at night.

277
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,128
I have a solution to your problem.

278
00:21:37,001 --> 00:21:39,740
Tell me what keeps you up at night.

279
00:21:40,947 --> 00:21:42,660
What else do you know about Em's case?

280
00:21:45,834 --> 00:21:48,374
Call me when you're ready.

281
00:21:49,511 --> 00:21:51,043
You know my number.

282
00:23:00,899 --> 00:23:02,364
I didn't know you were
discharged already.

283
00:23:04,329 --> 00:23:05,910
I got bored at the hospital.

284
00:23:07,273 --> 00:23:09,413
That's why I went here.

285
00:23:09,757 --> 00:23:11,415
Don't you want to see me?

286
00:23:15,036 --> 00:23:17,046
My handler told me

287
00:23:17,773 --> 00:23:21,342
that she declined a lot of interviews.

288
00:23:23,462 --> 00:23:25,464
But we can't keep on declining

289
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:28,140
because my endorsements
are backing out.

290
00:23:28,596 --> 00:23:30,451
And you need my help?

291
00:23:30,478 --> 00:23:31,645
Because of what?

292
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:46,200
Let's show the public
that we're together,

293
00:23:48,997 --> 00:23:50,162
that we're okay,

294
00:23:51,921 --> 00:23:53,515
and that we don't have problems.

295
00:23:56,147 --> 00:23:57,148
Please...

296
00:23:58,345 --> 00:24:00,840
You're going to use me
to deflect the issue?

297
00:24:01,228 --> 00:24:02,938
No, it's not like that.

298
00:24:03,228 --> 00:24:04,145
Look,

299
00:24:05,367 --> 00:24:07,947
I was supposed to have
a shoot for a noontime show,

300
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,210
but my manager said no

301
00:24:10,711 --> 00:24:13,018
because the hosts might ask about you.

302
00:24:14,395 --> 00:24:17,273
You know how tactless they can be.

303
00:24:19,066 --> 00:24:20,234
So in a way,

304
00:24:22,512 --> 00:24:25,155
I can't avoid being
dragged into your mess.

305
00:24:28,507 --> 00:24:29,410
I'm sorry.

306
00:24:34,198 --> 00:24:35,916
Please don't get mad.

307
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:45,634
Okay,

308
00:24:47,005 --> 00:24:48,304
I'll help you.

309
00:24:49,857 --> 00:24:52,182
Let's post our photos online.

310
00:24:52,836 --> 00:24:54,201
Let's go to the beach,

311
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:55,310
stroll at the mall,

312
00:24:56,765 --> 00:24:58,606
or go on a trip together.

313
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:01,567
In that way, people will start
talking about us.

314
00:25:02,248 --> 00:25:04,286
They will think that
we are going strong

315
00:25:04,311 --> 00:25:06,146
and that we are
happy together.

316
00:25:06,311 --> 00:25:07,256
Sure.

317
00:25:09,443 --> 00:25:10,300
Okay.

318
00:25:12,317 --> 00:25:13,262
Thank you.

319
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:19,293
Thank you.

320
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,360
You didn't even kiss me
when I walked in.

321
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:30,904
That's why I'm kissing you now.

322
00:25:43,988 --> 00:25:45,240
Let's take a selfie?

323
00:25:46,398 --> 00:25:47,607
Right now?

324
00:25:49,401 --> 00:25:50,324
Okay.

325
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:51,633
Alright.

326
00:25:56,543 --> 00:25:57,915
Smile, please.

327
00:26:01,407 --> 00:26:02,644
Kiss me on the cheek.

328
00:26:09,405 --> 00:26:10,527
Okay. My turn.

329
00:27:55,554 --> 00:27:56,742
Hey, stop that!

330
00:27:58,889 --> 00:28:00,095
What are you doing?

331
00:28:00,771 --> 00:28:01,914
Taking receipts.

332
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:04,808
Delete those. That's not funny.

333
00:28:04,864 --> 00:28:07,311
But you and Em
were also doing this, right?

334
00:28:07,491 --> 00:28:08,729
What the hell is your problem?

335
00:28:09,244 --> 00:28:10,939
I already told you that
I'm not the guy in the sex video.

336
00:28:11,443 --> 00:28:12,399
Give me that.

337
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:13,817
I'll delete the photos!

338
00:28:14,584 --> 00:28:16,470
- Give me back my phone, Trent!
- I'll delete the photos!

339
00:28:16,882 --> 00:28:18,197
Give it back to me!

340
00:28:22,012 --> 00:28:23,035
I'm sorry,

341
00:28:23,081 --> 00:28:24,995
but I'm just following
my manager's orders.

342
00:28:25,242 --> 00:28:29,541
Something we can use
against you in case you shit on me.

343
00:28:29,803 --> 00:28:30,959
Remember:

344
00:28:31,196 --> 00:28:32,544
This is my card against you.

345
00:28:33,237 --> 00:28:36,448
I know you wouldn't do anything,
but just to be sure.

346
00:28:53,616 --> 00:28:54,550
Get in.

347
00:28:55,656 --> 00:28:57,344
We need to talk.

348
00:29:09,835 --> 00:29:11,692
Belinda asked you

349
00:29:12,312 --> 00:29:15,982
if you wanted to undergo
marriage counseling.

350
00:29:16,814 --> 00:29:18,574
You know that was my idea.

351
00:29:20,354 --> 00:29:22,064
Why did you say no?

352
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:28,918
Why did she have to inform you?

353
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:33,088
No, she doesn't have to.

354
00:29:34,626 --> 00:29:37,217
The walls can talk, you know.

355
00:29:38,481 --> 00:29:40,429
I have trained rats

356
00:29:41,419 --> 00:29:43,015
to tell me all this.

357
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,728
I didn't know you talk to rats.

358
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,815
That's why I'm talking to you.

359
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,668
You know what,

360
00:30:00,728 --> 00:30:02,784
my daughter loves you so much.

361
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,996
That's why I don't understand

362
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:08,498
how you still have the balls

363
00:30:09,797 --> 00:30:11,299
to cheat on her.

364
00:30:15,686 --> 00:30:16,506
Hey.

365
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:21,094
Save your marriage

366
00:30:21,652 --> 00:30:23,388
for as long as you can.

367
00:30:25,383 --> 00:30:26,767
Or else,

368
00:30:29,084 --> 00:30:31,521
you might have
to save your own life.

369
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:35,751
That's more difficult,
I'm telling you.

370
00:30:40,945 --> 00:30:42,299
Are you threatening me?

371
00:30:45,354 --> 00:30:47,621
If you're afraid of the truth,

372
00:30:48,677 --> 00:30:49,498
then yes,

373
00:30:50,394 --> 00:30:52,042
I am.

374
00:31:08,245 --> 00:31:09,246
Hello...

375
00:31:11,075 --> 00:31:12,145
What's wrong with you?

376
00:31:13,023 --> 00:31:15,148
I already told you,
do not call this number.

377
00:31:16,672 --> 00:31:18,193
Please, not now.

378
00:31:19,372 --> 00:31:20,821
I'm here at Em's wake,

379
00:31:21,491 --> 00:31:22,450
okay?

380
00:31:23,555 --> 00:31:24,514
Alright.

381
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:27,094
Who are you talking to?

382
00:31:30,092 --> 00:31:32,040
It's my friend Fidel.

383
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:34,376
He is sending his condolences.

384
00:31:38,435 --> 00:31:39,436
Let's go?

385
00:31:47,693 --> 00:31:48,798
Let's have dinner?

386
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:51,435
I know a restaurant that
serves good Tonkantsu.

387
00:31:53,139 --> 00:31:54,246
I'm full.

388
00:31:54,636 --> 00:31:55,595
I see.

389
00:31:57,766 --> 00:31:59,568
Do you wanna hang out at my place?

390
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:05,507
Look, Trent.

391
00:32:05,553 --> 00:32:07,884
I know you're still upset
about the pictures.

392
00:32:08,131 --> 00:32:10,512
Don't worry,
I'll talk to my manager

393
00:32:10,787 --> 00:32:12,706
so that I can delete it.

394
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,729
What the fuck?!

395
00:32:21,528 --> 00:32:22,779
BE CAREFUL!

396
00:32:23,115 --> 00:32:24,742
Who the hell did this?!

397
00:32:25,758 --> 00:32:26,903
Oh my gosh,

398
00:32:28,199 --> 00:32:29,239
Trent.

399
00:32:31,557 --> 00:32:34,286
BE CAREFUL!

400
00:32:34,313 --> 00:32:34,995
Hey!

401
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:35,662
Hey!

402
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,272
Why are you still here?

403
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,876
I thought you already went home?

404
00:32:41,164 --> 00:32:42,335
I left some files in the office.

405
00:32:42,906 --> 00:32:44,379
I'm staying late with Patricia.

406
00:32:44,449 --> 00:32:47,410
She asked me to research
about that girl you assaulted.

407
00:32:48,818 --> 00:32:49,926
Agatha?

408
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:50,985
Yes.

409
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,037
What about her?

410
00:32:52,368 --> 00:32:54,472
Well, for some reason,

411
00:32:54,497 --> 00:32:56,641
she was already charged
with multiple estafa in the past.

412
00:32:56,666 --> 00:32:57,893
She was also a con artist.

413
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,142
But all her cases were dismissed,
which is weird, right?

414
00:33:00,864 --> 00:33:01,646
There.

415
00:33:02,029 --> 00:33:03,256
But why Agatha?

416
00:33:06,677 --> 00:33:07,986
I thought you already went home?

417
00:33:08,326 --> 00:33:10,154
Went home? What are you doing?

418
00:33:10,179 --> 00:33:11,823
Why are you still investigating Agatha?

419
00:33:11,982 --> 00:33:13,433
Philip warned you already!

420
00:33:14,366 --> 00:33:16,077
That's why I didn't ask you to join.

421
00:33:17,046 --> 00:33:18,205
Didn't ask me?

422
00:33:19,472 --> 00:33:21,557
But you're still on it!

423
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:22,334
Guys, guys...

424
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,611
Tell me when you're done
because I have a lead.

425
00:33:45,087 --> 00:33:46,399
Boys, be ready.

426
00:33:47,081 --> 00:33:48,276
We have an operation.

427
00:33:49,508 --> 00:33:51,154
You didn't see anybody?!

428
00:33:51,485 --> 00:33:53,323
How about your CCTVs?!

429
00:33:53,853 --> 00:33:56,159
We didn't, ma'am. We're very sorry.

430
00:33:56,273 --> 00:33:57,619
Why are those even there?

431
00:33:57,644 --> 00:33:58,662
For display?!

432
00:33:59,322 --> 00:34:02,582
Your residents are in danger here

433
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:04,109
and you're not even aware!

434
00:34:04,546 --> 00:34:06,962
We'll just file an
incident report about it.

435
00:34:10,459 --> 00:34:14,380
Let the car insurance
take care of the damage.

436
00:34:15,373 --> 00:34:17,447
I already booked a ride for us.

437
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,082
It will arrive in a moment.

438
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:20,559
Trent...

439
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:23,186
We'll file a police report.

440
00:34:23,477 --> 00:34:24,354
No need.

441
00:34:25,375 --> 00:34:26,840
What do you mean?!

442
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:29,593
Don't be a hero!

443
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:33,822
You're life is in danger and we need
to inform the authorities about it.

444
00:34:36,514 --> 00:34:37,392
There is no need.

445
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:41,062
I know who did this.

446
00:38:15,965 --> 00:38:17,545
Here is our prime suspect,

447
00:38:18,266 --> 00:38:19,380
Agatha David.

448
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,727
She was seen roaming
around Em's farmhouse

449
00:38:22,752 --> 00:38:24,636
days before she was found dead.

450
00:38:24,849 --> 00:38:26,095
Next slide, please.

451
00:38:27,552 --> 00:38:30,917
You can see in this photo
how obsessed she is with Em.

452
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:42,679
Agatha?

453
00:38:47,209 --> 00:38:48,618
What are you doing there?

454
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,702
Let's go?

455
00:38:50,126 --> 00:38:51,262
July.

456
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,237
But isn't that how fans are?

457
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,047
Yes,

458
00:39:01,766 --> 00:39:03,508
but Choi discovered something.

459
00:39:03,572 --> 00:39:04,676
Go ahead, Choi.

460
00:39:05,107 --> 00:39:07,262
We discovered a blog run by Agatha.

461
00:39:07,376 --> 00:39:09,722
It's a morbid fan fiction

462
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:11,933
where she and Em
are the lead characters.

463
00:39:12,386 --> 00:39:14,352
It has explicit content.

464
00:39:14,434 --> 00:39:16,688
Here is an excerpt:

465
00:39:16,999 --> 00:39:19,232
How nice it would
be to touch you,

466
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:20,541
to hug you;

467
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,234
to put my arms around your
neck and squeeze it

468
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:23,778
until you're out of breath.

469
00:39:24,043 --> 00:39:25,071
Okay.

470
00:39:25,172 --> 00:39:27,407
But you said so yourself,
it's fiction.

471
00:39:27,612 --> 00:39:29,868
Do you know what fiction means?

472
00:39:31,017 --> 00:39:32,412
It's not true!

473
00:39:33,576 --> 00:39:35,290
I've warned you!

474
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,750
Are you sure you're okay here?

475
00:39:38,456 --> 00:39:39,586
Yes.

476
00:39:40,278 --> 00:39:41,880
What the hell, Agatha.

477
00:39:43,035 --> 00:39:44,549
The last time I hid you,

478
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,802
you were running away from estafa.

479
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:52,265
What is it this time?

480
00:39:53,154 --> 00:39:54,887
I'll fix this in no time.

481
00:39:54,912 --> 00:39:56,127
Don't worry.

482
00:40:01,057 --> 00:40:02,592
You're always in trouble.

483
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,221
Why won't I be worried?

484
00:40:07,417 --> 00:40:08,335
Hush.

485
00:40:09,341 --> 00:40:11,184
Instead of worrying,

486
00:40:12,796 --> 00:40:15,021
why don't you just
enjoy this moment?

487
00:40:16,036 --> 00:40:17,482
Just like the old times.

488
00:40:19,466 --> 00:40:20,267
Just the two of us.

489
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:21,127
Ouch!

490
00:40:21,937 --> 00:40:22,920
Fuck!

491
00:40:33,698 --> 00:40:35,366
I already warned you

492
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,602
but you keep on
disobeying me!

493
00:40:37,867 --> 00:40:38,826
But chief,

494
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:42,974
it's obvious with
the way she moves.

495
00:40:42,999 --> 00:40:46,127
She hides whenever
she sees the police.

496
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,930
If she is innocent,
then there's no need to hide.

497
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,723
Don't give me that alibi!

498
00:41:15,788 --> 00:41:19,452
There's no serial killer
here in the Philippines!

499
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,979
Instead of calling
out Agent Esguerra,

500
00:41:22,004 --> 00:41:23,940
you encourage her instead!

501
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:27,944
Are you trying to score?

502
00:41:29,217 --> 00:41:30,272
No, boss.

503
00:41:52,872 --> 00:41:54,137
And you!

504
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:57,306
I entrusted this case to you

505
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:59,141
because you wanted to
prove something, right?

506
00:41:59,743 --> 00:42:02,253
You wanted to boost your career.

507
00:42:02,569 --> 00:42:05,798
The first thing you need
to do is obey me!

508
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:23,541
Chief...

509
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,250
Yes?

510
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,877
Sorry for interrupting.

511
00:42:26,063 --> 00:42:29,238
Congressman Chuatico
and Em's mom are outside.

512
00:42:37,166 --> 00:42:39,668
So, how are you going
to explain this to them?

513
00:42:41,347 --> 00:42:44,379
That we're accusing someone
with no solid evidence?

514
00:42:46,417 --> 00:42:47,632
Go and talk to them.

515
00:43:23,126 --> 00:43:24,419
How's everything?

516
00:43:25,255 --> 00:43:27,355
You found a new lead?

517
00:43:29,149 --> 00:43:30,717
Mr. Congressman, ma'am,

518
00:43:30,962 --> 00:43:33,720
the details of our investigation
are confidential.

519
00:43:34,392 --> 00:43:37,990
We can't disclose anything
unless confirmed.

520
00:43:38,149 --> 00:43:41,369
Why do you say confidential
when it's already out online?

521
00:43:41,871 --> 00:43:46,207
Can you confirm that
the suspect isn't part of our family?

522
00:43:46,554 --> 00:43:47,583
You're right,

523
00:43:48,279 --> 00:43:49,794
there's a new suspect,

524
00:43:49,832 --> 00:43:51,712
but just to be clear,

525
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,589
she's just a suspect.

526
00:43:53,726 --> 00:43:57,260
You need to catch her
before Em's burial.

527
00:43:57,429 --> 00:43:59,303
If she showed up at the wake,

528
00:43:59,542 --> 00:44:01,472
she'll also show up at the burial.

529
00:44:05,753 --> 00:44:07,253
I think it's better

530
00:44:07,915 --> 00:44:09,272
to have a manhunt operation,

531
00:44:09,401 --> 00:44:10,398
dead or alive.

532
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,024
Is two million pesos
enough as a cash reward?

533
00:44:12,253 --> 00:44:15,278
No, sir. Please don't.
Let us do our job.

534
00:44:15,303 --> 00:44:16,445
Then do your job well!

535
00:44:16,906 --> 00:44:18,739
What, you'll just let Em's case rot

536
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:21,617
just like all the other cases
in your cabinets?

537
00:44:22,141 --> 00:44:23,853
They are filled with unsolved cases.

538
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:08,857
You women are so
caught up in your emotions.

539
00:45:08,882 --> 00:45:11,584
So this is about me
being a woman, sir?

540
00:45:11,609 --> 00:45:12,888
Have you thought of quitting?

541
00:45:12,913 --> 00:45:14,478
I'm not doing anything wrong.

542
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:15,521
Who's that from?

543
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,700
From your son-in-law.

544
00:45:16,725 --> 00:45:17,731
Holy shit!

545
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:18,691
Look at this.

546
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:22,178
You'll help me when
I'm in need, right?

547
00:45:22,203 --> 00:45:23,612
Your husband is having an affair.

548
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:25,739
I'm not satisfied with Agatha.

549
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:27,741
I'll help you.
I'll hire a lawyer for you.

550
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:28,767
Do you love me?

551
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:29,459
Of course I do.

552
00:45:29,484 --> 00:45:31,228
Then why didn't you fight for me?

553
00:45:31,253 --> 00:45:33,130
Trent is being escorted
by Mr. Congressman's bodyguards.

554
00:45:33,155 --> 00:45:35,608
Why did you leave me, Em?
