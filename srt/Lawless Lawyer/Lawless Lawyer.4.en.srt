13
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:22,319
a single scratch
anywhere on her body,

14
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:25,519

Stop!

Stop it!

18
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:51,719
Get up!

19
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,390
Stop it!

20
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,650
- Let go of me.
- Stop!

21
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:02,930
I'll tell you.

22
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,530
I was ordered to kill
Mayor Lee Young Soo.

26
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,150
how he has gotten away
with all the dirty things...

27
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,780
he has done.

28
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,719
There's no need to go
all the way to court.

29
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:26,849
I'll show you here.

30
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:43,430
Ms. Ha, are you all right?

31
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:47,039
Look at me.

37
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,240
The witness in the mayor's case
changed his testimony?

38
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,379
You seem busy.

39
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,719
Was Prosecutor Kang
caught off guard then?

40
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,349
My goodness.

41
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,789
All right. It's an important trial,

42
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:38,319
so keep me updated.

43
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,830
What brings you by?

44
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,530
I thought the chairman of Ohju Group
was too busy to make visits.

45
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,800
It's really nothing.

46
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:49,900
I was passing by,

47
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:54,069
so I thought I'd pop in
and tell you something,

48
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,840
Chief Prosecutor.

49
00:03:55,939 --> 00:03:58,909
Why would I want to know
about how thugs are doing?

50
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,750
Chairman Oh will be running
for mayor in this by-election.

51
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:06,379
You cheeky boy.
The grown-ups are talking here.

52

An Oh Ju!

53
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:10,860
Keep your goons in line.

54
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,419
I apologize, Chief Prosecutor.

55
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,959
Did Judge Cha really appoint you
as the next mayor?

56
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,730
Are you sure you're not
getting ahead of yourself?

57
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,230
Goodness.

58
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,269
You're one of the people
who know her very well,

59
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:28,170
so how could you say that?

60
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:29,939
Despite my shortcomings,

61
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:34,680
she wants me to sacrifice
and devote myself to...

62
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,310
the city of Kiseong.

63
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,579
Sacrifice and devotion? You?

64
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,920
A cow would laugh at that.

65
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,819
You and your jokes.

66
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,689
Anyway, it's just that...

67
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:50,329
during my campaign,

68
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:54,899
I might need to know
about the law and...

69
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:56,170
discipline as well.

70
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,899
She thought you'd be
a great mentor for that,

71
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:03,910
so she personally told me
to seek you out for advice.

72
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,079
Is that so?

73
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:08,410
Is that what she said to you?

74
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,949
What about the broker?

75
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:18,389
I'm still discreetly tailing him.

76
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,689
How's Ms. Ha?

77
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,529
She's relaxing,
so don't worry too much.

78
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:24,660
Okay.

79
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,370
Are you all right?

80
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:35,740
Why did you do it?

81
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:40,779
The doctor gave you a sedative,
so you'll feel drowsy.

82
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,110
Get some sleep.

83
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:46,980
Are you all right?

84
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:49,550
Why did you get all worked up?

85
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:52,319
If it weren't for me,
something bad would've happened.

86
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,930
You seemed like a different person
today.

Come with me.

89
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:14,810
Judge Cha, take a look.

90
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,860
That man...

91
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:27,930
Judge Baek, what do you think?

92
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,930
I'm not sure.

This afternoon,

94
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,730
a man committed suicide by
jumping in front of a moving subway.

(Kiseong District Court)

96
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,970
The police is trying to
identify the man...

97
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,569
and is questioning
Attorney Bong and Attorney Ha,

98
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,079
who were at the scene.

99
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,810
The body has been...

100
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,279
Before he committed suicide,

101
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:49,209
he confessed to the murder.

102
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,379
Are you saying another man
killed Lee Young Soo?

103
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:53,889
That's right.

104
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,790
Did you record his statement?

105
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,790
No, it all happened so fast...

106
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,930
that I didn't get a chance to.

107
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,060
As of this moment,
all we have is your word.

108
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,930
Detective Wu's alibi
has been proven.

109
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:08,699
I guess you haven't
been following the trial.

110
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:11,470
To my knowledge,
it's still being evaluated.

111
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,439
Doesn't this bother you at all?

112
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,870
How can there be
a pile of definitive proof?

113
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,240
That's because
he's the one and only suspect.

114
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,550
Anyway,

115
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,350
tell me about
this so-called real killer.

116
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,279
Was it really a suicide?

117
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,790
You could've pushed him
onto the rails...

118
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:29,819
or persuaded him to...

119
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:31,420
Watch what you're saying.

120
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:35,089
Also, if you're going to arrest us,
provide us with a warrant first.

121
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:37,629
We don't need to be here. Let's go.

122
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:40,970
Collect the security footage...

123
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,899
and see what happened yourself,

124
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:44,500
instead of jumping to conclusions.

125
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:53,339
The deceased's cell phone
wasn't with his belongings.

126
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,910
Did you take it by any chance?

127
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:58,149
The investigator
thinks he's a murderer...

128
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,279
and the prosecutor thinks
he's a thief.

129
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:03,120
He's not the classroom ball.
Stop kicking him around.

130
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,120
She's right.

131
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,189
I can't believe
you'd think I'd steal anything.

132
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:08,459
It's just that you're not like...

133
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,829
other lawyers I've encountered.

134
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,959
Meanwhile, you seem overly invested.

135
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:16,899
Why are you obsessed
with Detective Wu's trial?

136
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:18,800
A lawyer wants to win trials.

137
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,339
Do we need a reason for that?

138
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:21,810
At first, I was curious,

139
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:23,639
but now I'm very interested.

140
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:26,110
I'll tell you when I win.

141
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,350
The reason, I mean.

142
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,090
Who knew that you'd
one day represent me?

143
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,759
I know you kept it
a secret on purpose.

144
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,230
An Oh Ju.

145
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,100
He said that name before dying.

146
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,899
Chairman Oh of Ohju Group.

147
00:08:58,779 --> 00:08:59,909
Sang Pil!

148
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,779
My goodness. Hello.

149
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,419
I'm Attorney Bong Sang Pil.

150
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,090
Oh, right.

151
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,820
Aren't you the lawyer for
Mayor Lee's trial?

152
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,490
I heard a lot about you.

153
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,799
It's funny how you
instantly recognized me.

154
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:21,000
This is Kiseong,
and I know everything...

155
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,899
that goes around here.

156
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,700
I used to be good friends
with Mayor Lee.

157
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,370
Since you're on the case though,

158
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:33,909
I feel awkward actually
talking to you like this.

159
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,450
You're trying to get
my friend's murderer...

160
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,620
a non-guilty verdict.

161
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:40,279
Another suspect in the case...

162
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:44,019
was known to be very close
to Detective Wu.

163
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:46,259
Is that what Wu Hyung Man said?

164
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,360
They probably met in passing,

165
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,000
and he's blowing it
out of proportion.

166
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:53,259
Soon,

167
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:57,870
Judge Cha will
get to the truth anyway.

168
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,269
That truth was just...

169
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,139
buried.

170
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,779
What do you mean?

171
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,779
The killer died.

172
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,919
Just now.

173
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,860
Right before he died, he told me...

174
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,659
who gave him the order to kill.

175
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:21,759
I'll tell you.

176
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,059
I was ordered to kill
Mayor Lee Young Soo.

177
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,570
Is that so?

178
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:30,299
Aren't you curious...

179
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,000
as to who ordered the hit...

180
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:35,970
on Mayor Lee Young Soo?

181
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,309
Why do you ask?

182
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,809
Did that jerk say my name,

183
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:46,279
An Oh Ju, or something?

184
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,850
Did he?

185
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:54,029
These days, people don't even
believe those who are alive.

186
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,389
Who'd believe what a dead guy said?

187
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:00,330
For someone who works
in the legal system,

188
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,299
you aren't very good at
distinguishing those false claims.

189
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:10,269
Sir.

190
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,480
Most people...

191
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:15,879
tell the truth
when they're faced with death.

192
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:18,379
I heard that
you're a very capable lawyer,

193
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:20,450
but you don't seem to know a thing.

194
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,190
I should do something
for the late Mayor Lee...

195
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,960
so that his soul can rest in peace.

196
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:31,200
By the way... Mr. Lawyer.

197
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:33,129
Have we met before?

198
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,299
Is it because I've heard
so much about you?

199
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:39,200
You look very familiar even though
you aren't from here.

200
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,169
I'm pretty sure we've met before.

201
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:44,809
Right?

202
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:48,509
Yes, I knew it.
When did we meet in the past?

203
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,379
I'm...

204
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,980
originally from Kiseong as well.

205
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:59,220
Is that right?

206
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:04,460
I'll see you around.

207
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,740
(Prosecution Service)

208
00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:25,950
Although Chairman An Oh Ju started
with nothing at a fish market,

209
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:29,720
he later founded Ohju Group
and made it big on his own.

210
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,620
He recently announced that
he'd like...

211
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,429
- Turn it off.
- to become a politician...

212
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:38,100
You can get sick
of even the nicest compliments.

213
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,429
I'm tired of hearing about it.

214
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:42,970
Meanwhile...

215
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:45,899
Sir.

216
00:12:46,669 --> 00:12:48,740
There's something
I need to tell you.

217
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,200
When did they put this on you?

218
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,200
Watch where you're going.

219
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,570
Bong Sang Pil set up a trap,

220
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,240
and we totally got caught in it.

221
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,440
I'm sorry, sir.

222
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:28,409
Do you know what it means...

223
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:30,110
when he put a tracker on you?

224
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,350
Yes, I do.

225
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,220
It means that he got involved...

226
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:37,250
in the trial to get me
from the beginning.

227
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:41,159
Thank goodness that guy...
What was his name? The hitman.

228
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,990
Thank goodness he died.
What would we have done otherwise?

229
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:45,799
I'll be sure...

230
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,870
to sort out the situation, sir.

231
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,440
Throw the body in the sea,
somewhere far from here.

232
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,840
You know what to do.

233
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:29,070
What were you staring at?

234
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:30,769
You startled me.

235
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,580
I know the doctor said
that you'd be sleepy,

236
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,149
but you're sleeping way too much.

237
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,019
I woke up a while ago.

238
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,419
You kept looking at my mom's photo.

239
00:14:44,419 --> 00:14:46,220
Oh, I was just...

240
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:49,730
thinking that's what
your mother looks like.

241
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,799
I was quite thrown off
by what happened earlier,

242
00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:56,769
but after getting some sleep...

243
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,399
- Do you feel better now?
- No.

244
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,070
You're making me cringe.

245
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:05,539
I mean, you drove me home.

246
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,649
It's giving me the chills.

247
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,149
- Jae I.
- Dad.

248
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,720
Are you Ms. Ha's father?

249
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:21,159
Are you Attorney Bong?

250
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:22,690
My gosh.

251
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,360
I've heard a lot about you.

252
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:28,299
I should've introduced myself
to you sooner. I'm Bong Sang Pil.

253
00:15:28,299 --> 00:15:30,669
He totally changes
when he's with elders.

254
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:32,570
He's like a different person.

255
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:36,669
Please come in for a cup of tea
since you came all the way here.

256
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,980
- Dad.
- We can't just...

257
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,009
Shall I?

258
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,409
Then I'll come in for a few minutes.

259
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:51,389
You knocked off
the accumulated interest for us.

260
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,059
Thank you very much.

261
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:54,629
What?

262
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:57,029
Really?

263
00:15:57,029 --> 00:16:00,000
Two of his employees came by
a while back and apologized.

264
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,029
They also compensated us
for all of the damaged things...

265
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,000
and even reduced the interest
for us.

266
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:06,070
Didn't you know about that?

267
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,509
Why didn't you tell me?

268
00:16:09,409 --> 00:16:11,980
Well... Are both of your parents...

269
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,710
doing well?

270
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:21,289
My mother raised me alone,

271
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,120
but she passed away
when I was young.

272
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,789
My gosh, I shouldn't have
asked you that question.

273
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:30,230
No, it's okay.

274
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:33,230
My mother was a lawyer too,

275
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,830
like Ms. Ha.

276
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,799
Your mother was a lawyer?

277
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,470
I must say,
she raised her son very well.

278
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:46,110
She was very different from me
as a lawyer.

279
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,179
I still have a long way to go
to become like her.

280
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,679
Jae I lost her mother
a long time ago as well.

281
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:54,820
You're in the same boat.

282
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:58,960
I want Jae I...

283
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,330
to become a judge that represents
the City of Kiseong...

284
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:05,160
like Judge Cha Moon Sook.
That's my dream.

285
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,230
I'm sure your mother...

286
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,569
would've hoped the same for you.

287
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,579
- Come on!
- Hurry up already.

288
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,210
- Hello, Boss.
- Hello, Boss.

289
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,410
Hey, guys. Where's Mr. Tae?

290
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,579
- He's inside.
- He's inside.

291
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,180
- Don't go overboard, guys.
- Okay, Boss.

292
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:29,950
- Kwang Soo.
- Hello, Boss.

293
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:31,690
Here.

294
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:34,089
This is the dead hitman's phone.

295
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,529
You can unlock this phone, right?

296
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:37,660
When did you get this?

297
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,829
- Before the cops showed up.
- You rock.

298
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:44,299
It's a new model.

299
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:46,000
It's locked
with the fingerprint scanner.

300
00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:49,210
It'll take me three days if I use
the program. That's too long, right?

301
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,740
Yes, that is too long.

302
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:52,579
- Let's do it manually.
- Okay.

303
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,750
- What about the broker?
- Geum Kang is watching him.

304
00:17:54,849 --> 00:17:58,519
Right now, that broker is the only
way we can get Wu Hyung Man out.

305
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:01,450
Unless we find
some clues on this phone, that is.

306
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,519
First,

307
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:04,589
I'll try to unlock this.

308
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:07,759
The hitman who killed Mayor Lee
is dead now,

309
00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:10,329
and the one who hired the hitman
wants to become the next mayor.

310
00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:13,230
The situation is quite urgent now,
Kwang Soo.

311
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:17,630
Hiding like this is making me feel
as if I've become a detective.

312
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:19,099
I'm on a stakeout.

313
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,640
This is fun.

314
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:26,380
What's the matter with him?
He's losing it.

315
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:32,349
Yes, Boss.
Detective Geum Kang here. Yes.

316
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,420
He's yelling and losing it.

317
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,589
My goodness. Yes.

318
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,759
Oh, you want other guys
to relieve me?

319
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:45,029
The hospital mortuary?

320
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,700
Got it. Yes, Boss.

321
00:18:50,069 --> 00:18:51,170
A mortuary?

322
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,839
Did someone pass away?

323
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:03,579
Is it okay for Chairman An
to become the mayor of the city?

324
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,549
He'll have to do it
if I tell him to.

325
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:09,519
You're right.

326
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,789
You're the one who makes that call.

327
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,859
Be polite to him
when he becomes the mayor.

328
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:20,259
I'm a bit concerned though.

329
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,670
Shall I say that...

330
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,799
it's a bit reckless to put him
in that position?

331
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,369
Or would be more accurate to say
it's a bit frightening?

332
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:31,109
What is this now?

333
00:19:31,109 --> 00:19:33,380
Are you trying to drag him down
even before he's elected?

334
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:35,549
Me?

335
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,480
My gosh. Not at all, ma'am.

336
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,450
From the accident in the subway
to everything else,

337
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:45,319
there's definitely something
suspicious about...

338
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:47,559
how Bong Sang Pil has been
causing a scene all over the city.

339
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:51,059
What lawyer can be that devoted
to his client?

340
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:55,369
I don't think he's doing that
just for the trial.

341
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:57,329
That's what my gut is telling me.

342
00:19:57,769 --> 00:19:59,670
Chairman An's looking into it.

343
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,450
This is what he meant by analog?

344
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:10,450
- Hey.
- Sir?

345
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,549
- Have you ever seen a body?
- Never.

346
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:13,950
Should I bow to it?

347
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,519
- Don't tremble.
- Should I burn incense?

348
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:25,730
This is the guy.

349
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:28,170
So we need his thumb, right?

350
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:30,670
No, sir.

351
00:20:31,069 --> 00:20:32,170
Let me...

352
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,670
do this.

353
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,869
We must not disrespect the dead,

354
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:40,079
but you can't get blood
on your hands.

355
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,079
What?

356
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,480
Hey, hey, hey.

357
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,309
What are you doing?

358
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,049
Don't we need his thumb?

359
00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:48,289
You're so frustrating.

360
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,049
Geum Kang, go and stand guard.

361
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:52,190
Yes, sir.

362
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,630
Why didn't I think of that?

363
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,900
You're the boss for a reason.
You're so smart.

364
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:07,799
Sir.

365
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,369
Someone's coming.

366
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:11,170
- Hide somewhere for now.
- Hide?

367
00:21:13,109 --> 00:21:14,309
We have to hide.

368
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:17,150
- Where should we hide?
- In here.

369
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:26,559
Get his thumbprint.

370
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,390
- Me?
- Hurry.

371
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,599
I'm sorry.

372
00:21:36,569 --> 00:21:37,569
Is it done?

373
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,970
It's done. Thank you.

374
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:44,140
(Daeho Stationary)

375
00:21:52,349 --> 00:21:53,619
I think Cha Moon Sook...

376
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:57,390
wants to make An Oh Ju
Kiseong's next mayor.

377
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:00,259
Someone like An Oh Ju
is running for office?

378
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,789
Is that possible?

379
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,730
For as long as
Cha Moon Sook's around,

380
00:22:04,329 --> 00:22:05,599
nothing is impossible.

381
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:13,769
Okay, Sang Pil. I get the situation.

382
00:22:13,769 --> 00:22:15,640
- Take care.
- Bye.

383
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,650
Sang Pil told me a lot about you.

384
00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:23,309
I see.

385
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,579
I'll see you around.

386
00:22:25,849 --> 00:22:26,849
Sure.

387
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,259
He owns a gallery?

388
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,029
What was the owner of
a galley in Seoul doing here?

389
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,400
You'll find out.

390
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:43,700
How do you know him that...

391
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:46,039
you two would discuss Cha Moon Sook?

392
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:50,740
Do you suspect her too?

393
00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:55,210
I'm even curious as to...

394
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,450
what you'll say next.

395
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,849
I want to know your hidden past.

396
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,789
Attorney Bong.

397
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:09,859
You don't suspect
just anyone, do you?

398
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:35,720
Choi Dae Woong...

399
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,160
came all the way to Kiseong?

400
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,390
Because of his minion's trial?

401
00:23:41,859 --> 00:23:42,930
Is that it?

402
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,859
Yes. I'm sure of it.

403
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:47,299
Okay, bye.

404
00:23:48,869 --> 00:23:51,970
Bong Sang Pil and Choi Dae Woong?

405
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:59,579
Why are all those fools
so interested in this trial?

406
00:24:00,509 --> 00:24:02,380
I got the hitman's call list.

407
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:05,750
- Okay.
- He didn't save any names.

408
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,589
List the ones he called
the most before he died.

409
00:24:09,589 --> 00:24:11,420
I'm sure there's a connection
to An Oh Ju in there.

410
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,420
Okay.

411
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,500
The deceased's cell phone
wasn't with his belongings.

412
00:24:24,869 --> 00:24:27,069
Did you take it by any chance?

413
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:31,269
Who do you think
would be most upset...

414
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:32,880
to hear I have this phone?

415
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:34,809
Who else could it be?

416
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,849
It would be that guy.

417
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,720
Shall I brag about it, then?

418
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,859
Ms. Ha, see you in court.

419
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:47,859
Sure.

420
00:24:47,859 --> 00:24:49,190
Goodbye, Boss.

421
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,500
I'm pretty sure we've met before.

422
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,440
Right? Yes, I knew it.
When did we meet in the past?

423
00:24:59,569 --> 00:25:00,569
I'm...

424
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:03,710
originally from Kiseong as well.

425
00:25:04,009 --> 00:25:06,210
My mother was a lawyer too,

426
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:07,779
like Ms. Ha.

427
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:19,619
Gwan Dong.

428
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:20,619
Yes, Boss.

429
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:22,460
When it comes to money,

430
00:25:23,329 --> 00:25:26,599
the giver gains power.

431
00:25:27,829 --> 00:25:32,170
The recipient will be
my slave forever.

432
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,799
- Do you get that?
- Yes, Boss.

433
00:25:34,369 --> 00:25:36,569
Giving cash to fools
who don't get that...

434
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:40,309
gets us results right away,
doesn't it?

435
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,980
Yes, Boss.

436
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,880
Chairman.

437
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:45,180
What is it?

438
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,420
The witness of
Wu Hyung Man's trial...

439
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,049
just called us.

440
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:51,720
What? The witness?

441
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,930
Chairman, he's here.

442
00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:13,240
My gut told me that...

443
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,750
we should avoid being seen together,

444
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,420
so I asked you to come here.

445
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,519
That's fine, sir.

446
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:23,289
Let's get to the point.

447
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,319
Did you see something...

448
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:30,329
in the warehouse that
Mayor Lee was killed in?

449
00:26:30,329 --> 00:26:31,329
Yes.

450
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:34,559
Mayor Lee Young Soo went in,

451
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,829
and someone else went in soon after.

452
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,000
I don't know who it was,

453
00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:41,599
but I'm sure that
it wasn't Wu Hyung Man.

454
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:43,470
Are you?

455
00:26:44,609 --> 00:26:45,880
How is that?

456
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,049
He was taller than Detective Wu...

457
00:26:49,049 --> 00:26:50,349
and thinner.

458
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,349
The crucial thing is,

459
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,150
Detective Wu has a limp.

460
00:26:56,549 --> 00:26:58,660
The man I saw walked just fine.

461
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,630
If that's all true,

462
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:06,630
poor Wu Hyung Man was framed.

463
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:11,069
Why did you come to me instead of...

464
00:27:11,069 --> 00:27:12,740
going to the police?

465
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:16,869
I know you two are very old friends.

466
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,410
I grew up in...

467
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,579
the Kiseong Fish Market
and know that much.

468
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:29,319
In order to save my friend,

469
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:32,390
I have to pay you, is that it?

470
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,390
Well...

471
00:27:33,789 --> 00:27:36,630
I just want a small amount...

472
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:38,329
by your standards.

473
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,000
In six months' time,

474
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:43,000
people will start moving in here.

475
00:27:45,099 --> 00:27:46,269
On each floor,

476
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,140
I'll let you set up
your vending machines.

477
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,569
That's too much.

478
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:56,750
Come closer to me.

479
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,750
Yes, sir.

480
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:01,950
This building is...

481
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:05,490
the seventh one I built...

482
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:09,759
in Kiseong, you know.

483
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:12,160
That's why I called it...

484
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,900
Chilseong Building.

485
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,039
The problem is,

486
00:28:22,009 --> 00:28:24,539
you won't get to see its completion.

487
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,779
What a pity.

488
00:28:38,089 --> 00:28:39,220
Gwan Dong.

489
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:42,630
Gwan Dong.

490
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:46,700
You fool.

491
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,730
- Seok Gwan Dong.
- Yes, Boss.

492
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:56,170
There might be things like
a video or something.

493
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:58,509
Go to where he lived...

494
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,440
and search every room
including the toilet.

495
00:29:01,809 --> 00:29:03,009
- Okay?
- Yes, Boss.

496
00:29:03,009 --> 00:29:06,349
If news gets out that a man
fell out of this building,

497
00:29:06,349 --> 00:29:07,680
people will say it's cursed,

498
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,589
and it will become an issue.

499
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:12,859
Get rid of the body
somewhere far away.

500
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:15,690
I'm off.

501
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,559
Yes, Boss.

502
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:34,309
Come on, everyone.

503
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,849
Let's start off with a drink.

504
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:39,650
Is this the start of your campaign?

505
00:29:40,849 --> 00:29:42,819
You know how Korea works.

506
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:44,490
The people come first,

507
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,259
companies come second,

508
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:49,230
and politics come third.

509
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:52,759
I'm already in the second tier...

510
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,660
in Kiseong,

511
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,529
but it looks like I'm
about to go into the third tier.

512
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:03,470
I know I don't
have to actually say this,

513
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:07,079
but please support Chairman An
the best you can.

514
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,410
With our combined force,
there's nothing that can't be done.

515
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:12,980
You'll be elected as mayor for sure.

516
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,950
Once you get elected,

517
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:18,289
let's get The Golden City
well on its way.

518
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,890
It's sad to see it be
on the back burner for 18 years.

519
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:25,259
My bank is ready to
provide the money.

520
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,859
Just become mayor,

521
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,170
and it's all yours.

522
00:30:29,299 --> 00:30:33,970
- Mr. Bank President, I'm grateful.
- No problem.

523
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:36,609
They say being addicted to politics
has no cure.

524
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,579
Do you even know what politics is?

525
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:45,519
I'll develop The Golden City,

526
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:48,420
feed the mouths of Kiseong people,

527
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:51,920
and win the trust of Judge Cha.

528
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,690
That's more than enough for me.

529
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:57,430
Those who don't know anything
politics got involved in it...

530
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,230
and made this country a mess.

531
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,359
Chief Prosecutor Jang,

532
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,640
if that's your concern,

533
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,400
you can help Chairman Oh
with his campaign.

534
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:11,009
- Great idea.
- Sounds perfect!

535
00:31:12,309 --> 00:31:13,910
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

536
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,920
Now, with Mayor Lee gone,

537
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,779
we still have an empty seat.

538
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,490
Who will fill it, I wonder.

539
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:26,190
Unlike other cities,
the mayor of Kiseong...

540
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,690
gains extraordinary
wealth and power.

541
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,890
And as Judge Cha's right-hand man,

542
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,630
that's double the threat.

543
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,630
What will you do with Ohju Group
once you're elected mayor?

544
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:44,170
My goodness. Ms. Nam,
you sure have a way...

545
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:48,009
of poking me
where it will hurt the most.

546
00:31:49,109 --> 00:31:51,480
Now I choose politics over money.

547
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:55,220
Since I decided to dedicate myself
to the city of Kiseong,

548
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,420
I'll have somebody else take over.

549
00:31:58,589 --> 00:32:02,130
I'll live the rest of my life
assisting Judge Cha...

550
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:06,099
and dedicate everything to Kiseong.

551
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,230
I'm not asking...

552
00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:12,839
to be mayor for free.

553
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,670
I put together a few
dried yellow corvina for all of you.

554
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:21,440
Go home
and grill them on a briquet fire...

555
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:24,779
and enjoy it
with your sons and daughters.

556
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:28,420
Let's drink some more then.

557
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,920
There you go.

558
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:48,069
Soon,

559
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:52,680
Judge Cha will
get to the truth anyway.

560
00:32:52,779 --> 00:32:54,279
For as long as
Cha Moon Sook's around,

561
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,609
nothing is impossible.

562
00:33:08,089 --> 00:33:10,559
Attorney Jang,
sorry for calling so late.

563
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:12,859
Do you still work at
the bar association?

564
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:17,400
I have a favor to ask.
It's information on a lawyer.

565
00:33:32,849 --> 00:33:37,319
You know, If I become mayor,

566
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,029
I'll put the plans of
The Golden City into motion...

567
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,660
and fill about 100 safes...

568
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:51,099
No, I'll fill about 1,000 of them
like this.

569
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,640
I mean,

570
00:33:59,609 --> 00:34:01,109
there's a reason...

571
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:05,009
why you chose me as mayor
and not Chief Prosecutor Jang.

572
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,450
Aren't I right?

573
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:09,489
Since you're supporting me though,

574
00:34:09,789 --> 00:34:12,019
I'd appreciate it
if you pushed me...

575
00:34:12,019 --> 00:34:15,019
along a paved highway
and not an unpaved road.

576
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:20,159
Judge Cha...

577
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:28,940
I'll be announcing my candidacy...

578
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:31,110
at the Kiseong Fish Market.

579
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,780
If you come...

580
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:38,710
and show your support in public...

581
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:42,289
I set the table for you,
so you should eat by yourself.

582
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:44,019
Just this once.

583
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:47,159
Please, just this once.

584
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:49,530
Grace us with your presence.

585
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,329
Are you asking me to
stand at a stinky fish market...

586
00:34:53,329 --> 00:34:55,929
and blabber on like
a common peddler?

587
00:34:57,699 --> 00:35:00,239
- Judge Cha...
- My word is final.

588
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,210
I understand.

589
00:35:18,019 --> 00:35:19,190
By the way,

590
00:35:21,389 --> 00:35:24,789
what about the video evidence
that surfaced during the trial?

591
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,559
What will you do with it?

592
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:31,769
If Wu Hyung Man's alibi is proven,

593
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,699
wouldn't that be
the end of the trial?

594
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:38,039
Why is that your concern?

595
00:35:38,309 --> 00:35:40,309
Just because
I selected you as mayor,

596
00:35:40,309 --> 00:35:42,980
do you think you're really
my right-hand man?

597
00:35:48,219 --> 00:35:50,190
My apologies, Judge Cha.

598
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:52,789
My courtroom is sacred.

599
00:35:52,789 --> 00:35:54,420
No one can intrude.

600
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:33,230
- I blame you!
- I told you not to call.

601
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,130
- Until when?
- Did you forget that I told you...

602
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:37,070
to lay low until we find you a boat?

603
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,599
Are you kidding me?

604
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:39,599
- I'm hanging up.
- Hey!

605
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,039
Is that the broker?

606
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:42,639
Yes, sir.

607
00:36:43,909 --> 00:36:47,480
A real man shouldn't make
a big fuss like that.

608
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,789
Is he calling again?

609
00:36:59,289 --> 00:37:01,159
He must be worried...

610
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:03,789
of losing his life while waiting.

611
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:07,000
The call is coming
from the hitman's phone.

612
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,199
But he's dead.

613
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,000
Check to see who has his phone.

614
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:18,809
I'm sorry that I'm not the hitman.

615
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:22,880
You probably shouldn't talk to me,
but you can't hang up either.

616
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,679
That's one huge dilemma.

617
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,250
I wonder what you...

618
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,650
and the hitman talked
over so many calls.

619
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:34,989
Anyway, I hope we could do the same.

620
00:37:35,489 --> 00:37:38,329
Don't forget to take my calls.

621
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,449
Bong Sang Pil.

622
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,949
The video evidence
submitted by the defense...

623
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,590
won't be admissible in court.

624
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,199
- May I ask why?
- It's the court's decision.

625
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,500
It was hard to recognize...

626
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,400
the man in the video...

627
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,300
as Wu Hyung Man.

628
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:24,869
Since we can't prove
the identity of the man...

629
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:26,579
or that he's the defendant,

630
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:28,710
she's not allowing
the video to be submitted.

631
00:38:29,949 --> 00:38:31,849
Is the perverted judge...

632
00:38:31,849 --> 00:38:33,280
also included in that decision?

633
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,420
There won't be
a change of judges either.

634
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,460
His alleged crimes
couldn't be confirmed,

635
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,960
so there's no reason for dismissal.

636
00:38:42,789 --> 00:38:45,329
Understood, Judge Cha.

637
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,400
That's it.
I'll see you at the next hearing.

638
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,670
Then it would be useless
to formally object...

639
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:52,170
with an expert's analysis
on the video then.

640
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:55,269
The sufficiency of my evidence
isn't the issue.

641
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,369
You just won't accept it.

642
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:58,070
Attorney Bong Sang Pil.

643
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:00,340
- I have to give you a warning.
- "A warning"?

644
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:03,179
If you continue to mock the court
with forged evidence...

645
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:06,079
and a fake witness,
I won't let it slide.

646
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,250
"Forged evidence
and a fake witness"?

647
00:39:09,449 --> 00:39:10,920
You tend to come to
your own conclusions.

648
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,349
Look, Attorney Bong.

649
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:17,760
Are you verbally attacking
the judge now?

650
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:21,500
Take back what you just said
before you get arrested again.

651
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,530
You definitely won't be able
to reject the evidence...

652
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,400
that I'll submit
at the next hearing.

653
00:39:27,869 --> 00:39:28,900
See you.

654
00:39:34,409 --> 00:39:36,380
The situation is
extremely unfavorable to you now.

655
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,750
How can you be that relaxed?

656
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:43,789
I'm just relieved, knowing that
the trial is going as I expected.

657
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,719
- Pardon?
- Chairman An Oh Ju...

658
00:39:47,019 --> 00:39:49,230
ordered a hit on the former mayor,
Lee Young Soo,

659
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:51,789
so that he can be
elected for the role.

660
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:55,659
What do you think?
Does my theory sound plausible?

661
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,599
Chairman An is surely
capable of doing that.

662
00:39:59,969 --> 00:40:02,510
Do you think it's a story I made up?
Or could it be true?

663
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,909
Ponder on it.

664
00:40:03,909 --> 00:40:05,469
That's complete nonsense.

665
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,610
Why are you telling me this?

666
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:08,940
Because you and I are...

667
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:11,909
enemies fighting against each other
for the truth.

668
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:28,630
- The phone has been turned off.
- Judge Cha Byung Ho's...

669
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,670
- Please leave a message...
- statue unveiling ceremony...

670
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,869
- after the tone.
- will be held today.

671
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:34,139
Judge Cha Byung Ho has
always topped the annual survey...

672
00:40:34,139 --> 00:40:37,369
of the most respected
public figures in Kiseong...

673
00:40:37,369 --> 00:40:38,769
for the last 20 years.

674
00:40:39,179 --> 00:40:42,480
His daughter, Judge Cha Moon Sook,
was ranked number two on the list.

675
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,809
She's currently the chief judge
of Kiseong Prosecutors' Office.

676
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:46,150
Is Ms. Ha not in the office?

677
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:47,949
- Her phone is off.
- Judge Cha rejected...

678
00:40:47,949 --> 00:40:49,489
- She went to visit Wu Hyung Man.
- the Supreme Court's offer...

679
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:50,989
to work for her hometown,

680
00:40:50,989 --> 00:40:52,320
- She went alone?
- Kiseong, which earned her...

681
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,929
- Is there a problem?
- respect of many citizens.

682
00:40:55,989 --> 00:40:57,559
- I'll call you later.
- Okay, Boss.

683
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:04,099
I heard the hitman died.

684
00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:05,969
Can you guys really get me out?

685
00:41:05,969 --> 00:41:07,800
We have Mr. Kang's statement,
which confirms your alibi,

686
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,309
as well as the video clip.

687
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:12,010
Attorney Bong went to find out if
they could be used as evidence,

688
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:13,239
so don't worry too much.

689
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,650
- And I was just wondering...
- Well...

690
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:20,019
Do you think Cha Moon Sook
will make it that easy for us?

691
00:41:20,449 --> 00:41:21,650
What do you mean by that?

692
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:24,349
Do you think she'll let us
prove my innocence?

693
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,590
She's trying to kill me
with the law.

694
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,119
Why are you bringing up
Judge Cha Moon Sook...

695
00:41:29,659 --> 00:41:30,690
Hey.

696
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,530
Cha Moon Sook and An Oh Ju are
colluding together. Didn't you know?

697
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:34,699
Enough, Wu Hyung Man.

698
00:41:34,699 --> 00:41:36,170
- What...
- What's with that face?

699
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:38,269
Are you saying
she really has no idea?

700
00:41:39,969 --> 00:41:41,239
Get up, Ms. Ha.

701
00:41:42,539 --> 00:41:43,739
Let's talk outside.

702
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,909
You two work together.
Didn't you tell her?

703
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:54,519
The Judge Cha that I know
isn't someone...

704
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,820
whom people like Wu Hyung Man
can dare mention.

705
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,260
Have you thought deeply
about Judge Cha?

706
00:42:00,889 --> 00:42:01,960
What do you mean?

707
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:05,329
You may think that you know her
better than anybody else does,

708
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:07,599
but you could be wrong.

709
00:42:08,699 --> 00:42:11,329
I don't doubt the people I trust.

710
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:12,840
Judge Cha...

711
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,269
rejected both the evidence
and the witness.

712
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,369
She rejected both of them?

713
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,980
Even Mr. Kang's video clip?

714
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:22,909
That's right.

715
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:25,750
She'd never do that.

716
00:42:25,949 --> 00:42:27,250
What you know...

717
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,050
about Judge Cha is all a lie.

718
00:42:32,989 --> 00:42:35,320
Aren't you Jae I?

719
00:42:36,289 --> 00:42:37,559
Ha Jae I, right?

720
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,530
Detective Gong Jang Soo?

721
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:43,099
Here you go.

722
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:45,800
So, you're an attorney now.

723
00:42:46,699 --> 00:42:50,010
Your mother would've been
very proud of you.

724
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:51,269
Yes.

725
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:55,239
I haven't found my mom yet,

726
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:58,250
but I'm always grateful
for everything you did.

727
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,150
You didn't give up.

728
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:03,219
That's my job, you know.

729
00:43:03,989 --> 00:43:05,190
Detective Gong.

730
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,019
I still haven't given up...

731
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,260
on finding my mom.

732
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:11,630
Of course, you shouldn't.

733
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,429
Yes, I'll leave right away.

734
00:43:19,739 --> 00:43:21,269
Jae I, I have to rush to the scene.

735
00:43:21,269 --> 00:43:23,269
- Oh, okay. You should get going.
- I'll be in touch.

736
00:43:30,579 --> 00:43:32,880
My mom went out to buy me a
harmonica to replace my broken one,

737
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,719
but she never came back.

738
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:38,190
But when I blew into it
the next day,

739
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:39,989
I found out it wasn't broken.

740
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,630
The guilt will follow me everywhere
all my life.

741
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:48,260
My mom, who I thought
would always keep me safe,

742
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:50,199
vanished like that.

743
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:55,440
To this day, I still can't
come to terms with it or believe it.

744
00:43:56,369 --> 00:43:57,570
Not even for a day.

745
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,780
I can probably relate to that
better than anybody else can.

746
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:04,150
I went through something similar.

747
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:10,519
Attorney Bong.

748
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:15,860
Judge Cha...

749
00:44:16,329 --> 00:44:18,329
is like a mom to me.

750
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:20,559
I know.

751
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:21,929
If I'm being fooled...

752
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:24,130
by Judge Cha,

753
00:44:24,369 --> 00:44:25,429
prove it to me.

754
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:27,969
Make me believe it.

755
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:31,170
Try to persuade me.

756
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:36,110
Until you do that,
I won't believe in anything you say.

757
00:44:41,449 --> 00:44:42,519
Jae I.

758
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:46,260
Let's get a piece of toast.
I'm hungry.

759
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:49,360
I think you're addicted
to carbohydrates.

760
00:44:49,929 --> 00:44:51,789
This isn't even considered
carbohydrates.

761
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,400
Can you pay for mine?

762
00:44:55,099 --> 00:44:56,699
- We'll pay separately.
- Okay.

763
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:08,579
Jang Soo, this is an obvious case.

764
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:09,610
He took his own life. Let's go.

765
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:11,780
- Wait, hold on.
- Why don't we get some naengmyeon?

766
00:45:15,449 --> 00:45:17,690
Why did he jump to death
on such a beautiful day? Take him.

767
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:20,519
Do you think that everyone who died
here commits suicide?

768
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:22,460
That's Suicide Rock.

769
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:26,099
At least 20 people jump off
that rock and die every year.

770
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:29,260
Even if that's the case, you need
to investigate the case properly.

771
00:45:30,869 --> 00:45:33,369
We found a harassing
payment reminder in his pocket.

772
00:45:33,469 --> 00:45:36,170
This is pretty much the same thing
as a suicide letter.

773
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:37,969
Hey, that's...

774
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:39,269
Gosh, forget it.

775
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:41,679
I heard you were reprimanded
years ago...

776
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:44,949
for raising objections to a case
that was concluded as suicide.

777
00:45:46,849 --> 00:45:49,449
Old habits really do die hard,
don't they?

778
00:45:50,019 --> 00:45:51,090

Sir, please try to...

782
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,829
Goodness, why should I?

783
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:07,300
- What is this nonsense?
- He was the one who...

784
00:46:08,369 --> 00:46:10,239
Then tell Mr. Park to come here.

785
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,469
I'm telling you if you get locked up
again, you won't come out.

786
00:46:12,739 --> 00:46:15,710
- Why can't he...
- He's just someone Mr. Park knows.

(Lawless Law Firm,

799
00:48:21,639 --> 00:48:25,110
Are you sure that the broker put
An Oh Ju in touch with the hitman?

800
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:26,809
I've gone through the call history.

801
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:29,079
The broker, the hitman,
and Secretary Kim...

802
00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:31,250
talked on the phone so many times
leading up to the murder,

803
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:32,949
but they suddenly stopped talking
altogether.

804
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,849
So the broker didn't
just arrange the stowaway.

That's right.

815
00:49:04,409 --> 00:49:06,079
So I will go...

816
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:07,449
wherever you go.

817
00:49:07,949 --> 00:49:09,150
Hey, Ha Jae I...

818
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:15,619
Boss.

819
00:49:30,039 --> 00:49:31,409
I just caught up with him.

820
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:32,639
Where are you?

821
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:34,110
Okay.

822
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:35,440
We're almost there.

823
00:49:35,909 --> 00:49:38,050
Don't do anything to scare him.
Just keep an eye on him

824
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:39,110
Okay.

825
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,280
Bye.

826
00:49:41,219 --> 00:49:44,750
So you found him
while tracing his call history?

827
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:48,360
How did you get
the dead hitman's phone?

828
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:51,630
Did you really...

829
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:53,260
Step on it, Kwang Soo.

830
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,000
Are you really going to
act like this?

831
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,630
You know we can't use evidence
we obtained illegally.

832
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:03,309
Ms. Ha, isn't it time you
get used to how we do things?

833
00:50:03,869 --> 00:50:05,239
I said step on it.

834
00:50:05,239 --> 00:50:07,380
Ms. Ha, hold on tight.

835
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:09,139
Why should I...

836
00:50:33,699 --> 00:50:35,400
He let his guard down.

837
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:37,239
This is our chance.

838
00:50:37,369 --> 00:50:38,840
- Wait.
- Pardon?

839
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,639
- Wait a bit.
- Look.

840
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:43,309
Two brokers exchanging
hand signals. They're thorough.

841
00:50:43,309 --> 00:50:44,309
It's his mom.

842
00:50:45,579 --> 00:50:46,579
"His mom"?

843
00:50:47,449 --> 00:50:49,849
I don't want him to flee
in front of his mother.

844
00:50:50,349 --> 00:50:51,690
Let's wait until they part.

845
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:53,219
Yes, Boss.

846
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:03,500
Did you hear back from those
I invited to the statue's unveiling?

847
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:06,440
All the VIPs agreed to attend.

848
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:09,500
No one would dare refuse...

849
00:51:10,309 --> 00:51:13,809
if they want to continue
doing business in Kiseong.

850
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:18,949
Do you have the details
on Bong Sang Pil?

851
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:22,150
His mother was
a civil rights lawyer.

852
00:51:23,019 --> 00:51:24,750
Choi Dae Woong was her brother,

853
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:25,989
and she committed suicide.

854
00:51:26,389 --> 00:51:27,519
"Suicide"?

855
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:30,860
It happened 18 years ago
here in Kiseong.

856
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:32,059
- Her name was...
- Stop.

857
00:51:36,699 --> 00:51:41,969
Was her name Choi Jin Ae?

858
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,409
Do you know her?

859
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:49,139
I'm pretty sure we've met before.

860
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:51,079
I'm...

861
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:53,719
originally from Kiseong as well.

862
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,690
The fool...

863
00:51:58,789 --> 00:52:02,690
Wu Hyung Man, that fool...

864
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:04,989
Hyung Man, grab a hold of that kid.

865
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:08,929
Then what about the woman?

866
00:52:08,929 --> 00:52:10,869
Bury her with the kid.

867
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:13,739
For 18 long years,

868
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,940
you did well to deceive me.

869
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:24,309
- You're cute.
- Don't touch me.

870
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:26,150
Bong Sang Pil.

871
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:28,679
He didn't die...

872
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:32,050
and came back as an attorney.

873
00:52:33,519 --> 00:52:37,030
You came back to Kiseong...

874
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:40,460
did you now?

875
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:46,570
Who are you?

876
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:47,570
Get out.

877
00:52:47,739 --> 00:52:49,670
- Come on.
- Hey, hey.

878
00:52:50,139 --> 00:52:52,039
- Get out.
- I said get out.

879
00:52:53,539 --> 00:52:55,639
Get out of the car.

880
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:56,650
Hold on tight.

881
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:02,150
Stop.

882
00:53:02,519 --> 00:53:03,519
Stop!

883
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:11,030
Welcome to the unveiling of
the statue...

884
00:53:11,389 --> 00:53:15,099
of Cha Byung Ho,
the father of Kiseong City.

885
00:53:24,269 --> 00:53:27,110
1, 2, 3.

886
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,650
It looks like he's still alive.

887
00:53:39,989 --> 00:53:41,119
(Congratulations)

888
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:42,690
(Cha Moon Sook)

889
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:49,760
Everyone!

890
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:53,840
It's as if Cha Byung Ho is
alive and well,

891
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:57,340
and he has returned to Kiseong!

892
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:58,809
Applause!

893
00:54:08,179 --> 00:54:10,150
Stop. Stop!

894
00:54:10,219 --> 00:54:11,289
Stop the car!

895
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:16,889
Watch out for the people!

896
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:20,159
My goodness!

897
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:42,119
Die!

898
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:52,989
What's going on?

899
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:55,530
Not this way!

900
00:54:56,429 --> 00:54:57,429
My gosh.

901
00:54:58,429 --> 00:54:59,769
Over here!

902
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:02,539
Watch out!

903
00:55:04,739 --> 00:55:06,210
Hey!

904
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:08,380
Keep up!

905
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,559
- I'm in here!
- Go away!

906
00:55:28,599 --> 00:55:29,599
Watch out!

907
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:50,349
My late father only knew about law,

908
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:52,349
justice and rulings.

909
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:55,159
Everything else,
he knew nothing about.

910
00:55:55,789 --> 00:55:58,059
He demanded the same from me.

911
00:55:58,059 --> 00:56:00,429
He said a judge should
care for nothing else.

912
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:02,500
That I should stay in the back...

913
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:05,800
and not crave power or a title.

914
00:56:06,469 --> 00:56:10,409
He taught me to look out for
the powerless and weak.

915
00:56:10,769 --> 00:56:12,840
He said that was a judge's duty.

916
00:56:17,409 --> 00:56:20,949
I always try to
follow his teachings.

917
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:23,420
I am doing only what is right,

918
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:27,860
yet you have given me such
overwhelming praise and reverence.

919
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:34,260
(Congratulations)

920
00:56:34,699 --> 00:56:36,199
Cha Byung Ho!

921
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:38,769
Cha Byung Ho! Give me that.

922
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:41,369
Cheer for Cha Byung Ho!

923
00:56:41,369 --> 00:56:43,969
Cheer for Judge Cha Byung Ho!

924
00:56:44,909 --> 00:56:46,309
Cheer for Cha Byung Ho!

925
00:56:46,309 --> 00:56:47,409
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

926
00:56:47,409 --> 00:56:50,110
Cheer for Cha Byung Ho!

927
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:51,710
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

928
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:52,949
Okay, so...

929
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,489
I am so honored that my company,

930
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:01,719
Ohju Group
was allowed to commission...

931
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:05,960
Cha Byung Ho's statue...

932
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:09,929
to be displayed in Kiseong Court.

933
00:57:10,599 --> 00:57:14,739
Dear Judge Cha Moon Sook,
whom I respect and revere,

934
00:57:16,039 --> 00:57:17,039
as well as...

935
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:19,769
the people of Kiseong,

936
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:22,309
I hereby announce that...

937
00:57:23,679 --> 00:57:26,610
I intend to run
for mayor of Kiseong.

938
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,690
Even though I lack in many ways,

939
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:32,849
- I will do my best...
- He went and did it.

940
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:35,019
- to serve Kiseong.
- She told him not to this.

941
00:57:35,019 --> 00:57:36,960
Please allow me to do so.

942
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:39,260
I'm An Oh Ju,

943
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:41,300
a son of Kiseong.

944
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:44,829
If it's to become mayor,

945
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:48,900
I will give everything to the city.

946
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,670
An Oh Ju.

947
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:54,139
- An Oh Ju. An Oh Ju.
- An Oh Ju. An Oh Ju.

948
00:57:54,139 --> 00:57:57,380
- An Oh Ju. An Oh Ju.
- An Oh Ju. An Oh Ju.

949
00:57:57,510 --> 00:58:00,449
- Mayor of Kiseong, An Oh Ju!
- Mayor of Kiseong, An Oh Ju!

950
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:03,449
- An Oh Ju. An Oh Ju.
- An Oh Ju. An Oh Ju.

951
00:58:03,449 --> 00:58:05,690
(Unveiling Ceremony of
Judge Cha Byung Ho's Statue)

952
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:10,460
"Unveiling Ceremony"?
What are we doing here?

953
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:14,230
Are you...

954
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:20,030
- An Oh Ju. An Oh Ju.
- An Oh Ju. An Oh Ju.

955
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:21,869
- Mayor of Kiseong, An Oh Ju!
- Mayor of Kiseong, An Oh Ju!

956
00:58:21,869 --> 00:58:23,610
- An Oh Ju. An Oh Ju.
- An Oh Ju. An Oh Ju.

957
00:58:24,139 --> 00:58:25,369
- An Oh Ju!
- Step aside!

958
00:58:25,369 --> 00:58:27,639
- Move away.
- What is he doing here?

959
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:34,949
What's going on?

960
00:58:34,949 --> 00:58:37,349
What are they doing
at the unveiling ceremony?

961
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:42,719
Everyone,
can I have your attention please?

962
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:46,329
Nice to meet you.

963
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:49,300
I'm Attorney Bong Sang Pil.

964
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:50,530
What?

965
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:51,630
What is he doing here?

966
00:58:53,099 --> 00:58:55,300
I came up here...

967
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:57,409
to tell you something.

968
00:58:58,269 --> 00:59:00,210
I'm sorry if I was rude.

969
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:08,019
All right. Prosecutor Kang Yeon Hee?
Where are you?

970
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:12,420
This is the broker
who set the hitman up...

971
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:15,219
with the very person who solicited
to murder Mayor Lee Young Soo.

972
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:19,260
Now, it's Prosecutor Kang's job...

973
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:22,329
to uncover the truth.

974
00:59:32,909 --> 00:59:34,079
Hey, Bong Sang Pil.

975
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:36,780
You're on a roll today.

976
00:59:42,519 --> 00:59:44,650
Let's go, Judge Cha.

977
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:05,940
Sang Pil, that's enough.

978
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:07,710
Jae I.

979
01:00:08,179 --> 01:00:10,239
Brace yourself and follow me.

980
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:15,719
Why are you doing this?
There has to be another way...

981
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:28,030
Judge Cha.

982
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:32,769
Judge Cha.

983
01:00:41,079 --> 01:00:44,449
How dare you hijack my father's
unveiling ceremony like that?

984
01:00:54,789 --> 01:00:56,820
Do you expect
to run for mayor after this?

985
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:01,099
Bong Sang Pil.

986
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:05,199
I've discovered
Bong Sang Pil's identity.

987
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:08,840
But the name of a person...

988
01:01:09,869 --> 01:01:12,869
I do not wish to remember came up.

989
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:18,849
The attorney that you trusted...

990
01:01:19,449 --> 01:01:20,679
and cared for.

991
01:01:21,949 --> 01:01:23,280
Choi Jin Ae?

992
01:01:24,119 --> 01:01:25,750
That attorney.

993
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:29,590
Leave.

994
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,360
Pardon?

995
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:35,559
- So...
- I get it. Just go.

996
01:01:37,769 --> 01:01:38,829
Yes, ma'am.

997
01:02:05,659 --> 01:02:07,500
I'm sorry about earlier.

998
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,329
Judge Cha Moon Sook.

999
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:17,840
I don't remember inviting you today.

1000
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:23,579
The star of a party
is always the unwelcomed guest.

1001
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:30,590
Why did you ruin
my father's unveiling party?

1002
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:33,019
I know you want to destroy
Wu Hyung Man with the trial...

1003
01:02:33,019 --> 01:02:35,989
and make An Oh Ju
the mayor with your power.

1004
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:38,260
But it will never happen.

1005
01:02:39,559 --> 01:02:41,300
Are you trying
to frame me or something?

1006
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,500
As long as I get to stand
before the court,

1007
01:02:43,829 --> 01:02:46,269
innocent people won't be murdered...

1008
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:47,969
by law anymore.

1009
01:02:52,610 --> 01:02:53,739
Okay.

1010
01:02:54,309 --> 01:02:57,550
You took after Jin Ae a lot.

1011
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:00,920
You're bold and reckless.

1012
01:03:02,619 --> 01:03:03,920
Don't ever...

1013
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:07,559
talk about my mother again.

1014
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:10,019
Do you think...

1015
01:03:10,929 --> 01:03:12,690
you're the first one...

1016
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:14,929
to come to see me like this?

1017
01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:16,630
I will...

1018
01:03:17,929 --> 01:03:19,929
show you the end of it.

1019
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,070
For the first time.

1020
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,440
(Lawless Lawyer)

1021
01:03:56,769 --> 01:03:59,840
How much do you think
you know about Bong Sang Pil?

1022
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,980
She'd abandon
either Cha Moon Sook or me.

1023
01:04:02,110 --> 01:04:03,710
She'd choose between the two.

1024
01:04:03,949 --> 01:04:04,949
Please forgive me.

1025
01:04:04,949 --> 01:04:08,150
The only person
I can forgive is myself.

1026
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:10,079
What do I not know?

1027
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:12,619
Do you think it's a coincidence
that you met Sang Pil...

1028
01:04:12,619 --> 01:04:13,820
as soon as you went back to Kiseong?

1029
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:16,789
The criminal always returns
to the scene of the crime.

1030
01:04:16,789 --> 01:04:19,030
I know who killed your mother.

1031
01:04:19,789 --> 01:04:21,659
If he doesn't talk,
we'll drag him out of this room.

1032
01:04:21,659 --> 01:04:22,829
I'll answer.

1033
01:04:22,929 --> 01:04:24,670
That's all, Your Honor.
