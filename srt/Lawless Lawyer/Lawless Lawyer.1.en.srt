(Lawless Lawyer)

00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:03,000
(Police)

8
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:41,670
My gosh. Hello, Officer.

9
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,969
You know why I stopped you, right?

10
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:44,579
Let me see your license.

11
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,439
Sure thing. I should cooperate.

12
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,849
Let's see.

13
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:57,219
What are you doing now?

14
00:01:57,219 --> 00:01:59,159
Oh, these bills are a bit too crisp.

15
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,230
Are you trying to bribe
a police officer now?

16
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:03,930
No, it's not that.

17
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,859
Stop trying to be sneaky. Get out.

18
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:06,900
Wait, hold on.

19
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,270
Gosh, this man...

20
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,569
I said, get out.

21
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,270
Goodness,
cut me some slack, will you?

22
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,879
Come this way, please.

23
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,090
Gosh, I'm sorry about that.

24
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:33,090
There's a traffic monitoring camera
up there.

25
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:35,560
This spot should be safe.

26
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,830
- What is this?
- Come on, you know what it's for.

27
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,400
You tried to express
your gratitude toward me just now.

28
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,539
When?

29
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:52,310
I couldn't close my big fat wallet,

30
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,780
so I was taking a few bills out,
that's all.

31
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,310
Gosh, seriously.

32
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:57,919
Are you kidding me right now?

33
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,550
All right, then. If that's the case,

34
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:04,020
I'll be sure to give you
the highest penalty.

35
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,090
Give me your license.

36
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,229
Oh, my driver's license.
Sure, no problem.

37
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:09,889
Let's see.

38
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,360
Here you go.

39
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,199
(Attorney Bong Sang Pil)

40
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:18,340
I see that you're a lawyer,
but so what?

41
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:22,840
Sergeant Park Mun Seong
in Traffic Enforcement...

42
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,409
at Northern Gyeonggi
Provincial Police Agency.

43
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:28,979
Who are you?

44
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,590
A client hired me for a bribery
case, and I just obtained...

45
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:37,590
evidence number seven,
which I'll use for the litigations.

46
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,430
No, not that one. Over there.

47
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,330
This evidence proves
that you've been...

48
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,800
demanding bribes in return for
letting traffic violations slide.

49
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,469
The excessive regulation and
threatening requests for bribes...

50
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:54,509
made my client shed tears.

51
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,710
I'll make sure he's compensated
monetarily for the tears he shed.

52
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,680
My goodness.

53
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,509
Please don't be like this.

54
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:04,750
I'm a busy man.
Please issue the ticket quickly.

55
00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:08,050
The one with the maximum
demerit points.

56
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,030
Sang Pil, where are you now?

57
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,129
I'm coming to rescue
the gangster accountant.

58
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,569
Please don't kill me.

59
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,540
You want to live? You jerk.

60
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,620
I've been telling everyone that
you're such an amazing accountant.

61
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,589
How many buildings did I buy
with the tax money...

62
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:42,689
you saved me?

63
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,459
Think about it.
How can I not be attached to you?

64
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,100
You made it.

65
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:55,370
Yes, what's the situation now?

66
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,629
Don't you hear the scream?

67
00:04:58,069 --> 00:05:00,269
Wait, hold on. Just a second.

68
00:05:00,269 --> 00:05:01,339
Wait for me.

69
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,129
- Who's that?
- What's going on?

70
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,360
- What's happening?
- Who's that guy?

71
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,529
- What does he want?
- Hello.

72
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,870
Please just be natural.

73
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:32,800
Why are you guys just
standing around? Get that rat!

74
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:34,170
- That jerk!
- Come here! You little...

75
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:37,040
If you lay even a finger on me,

76
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,740
you'll regret it.

77
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,509
I'm that man's...

78
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:49,389
See this guy beaten up to a pulp?
I'm his legal representative.

79
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:50,689
He's a lawyer, Boss.

80
00:05:54,329 --> 00:05:57,430
Why would a lawyer
set foot in this place? How gutsy.

81
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,629
I'm aware that there's a problem
between you and my client,

82
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:03,329
and I'm here
help you two solve the issue...

83
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,269
step by step
through my legal guidance.

84
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:08,069
Stop going on about the law,
will you?

85
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:09,410
Do you think this is court?

86
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:11,579
Whack him!

87
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:17,079
I knew that it'd be hard
to talk to you guys,

88
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,420
but go easy on me, please.

89
00:06:19,649 --> 00:06:21,189
Well, if that's the case...

90
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,459
Yes, you over there.

91
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,629
Let me start with you.

92
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:29,129
What did you just say?

93
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,459
You piece of...

94
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:35,430
How dare you punch him? You jerks!

95
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:37,569
- You little...
- Wait!

96
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:44,779
All right, everything I do from now
will be considered self-defense.

97
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:48,110
That will be the case only if you
can walk out of here in one piece.

98
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,310
What are you waiting for? Whack him!

99
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,050
Wait, hold on.

100
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,290
I guess you guys don't know.

101
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:57,860
This suit is
from a high-end Italian brand.

102
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,160
I wouldn't want it
to get wrinkled up.

103
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,629
Now that I've taken it off, you guys
can come at me all you want.

104
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:05,660
- I'm ready.
- You little...

105
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,300
You scum.

106
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,300
What did you just say?

107
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:12,899
Listen up. If you use that,
you'll get locked up for five years.

108
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:15,370
If you drop it now,
it'll be reduced to two years.

109
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,670
Dropping it...

110
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:19,579
will be considered
a mitigating factor.

111
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:22,079
You'll end up with a lighter
sentence than even those...

112
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:23,680
who never used their tools
from the beginning.

113
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,879
What on earth are you doing now?

114
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:29,220
Whack him already.

115
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,449
Wait!

116
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:32,319
Have a look at this.

117
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,389
What's your problem...

118
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:35,790
This shows...

119
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,300
the financial records of tax evasion
you've committed...

120
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,230
while running your company
for the last five years.

121
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:42,269
Take a look at this evidence here.

122
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:44,000
You'll be charged with assault
and harassment,

123
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:46,240
which can put you behind bars
for 7 years and 3 months.

124
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,339
If attempted murder
is added on top of that...

125
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:52,209
It'll depend on the judge,
but the minimum would be 17 years.

126
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,610
If I report you to the National
Tax Service for tax evasion,

127
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:57,779
they'll collect two million dollars
from you.

128
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,220
The total amount of money
you lost because of my client...

129
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,319
is 800,000 dollars.

130
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,660
Do you really want to lose
two million dollars...

131
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:07,790
and end up in jail
because of the 800,000 dollars?

132
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,629
You've had to forcefully
take money...

133
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,500
from many people and do other
shady things to earn your money.

134
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,500
You'll give it all to the government
when it's done nothing for you?

135
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:23,439
How can we trust that
he'll not report us to NTS?

136
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,379
Who's going to guarantee it?

137
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:32,450
I'll guarantee it.

138
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,049
What's going on?

139
00:08:50,169 --> 00:08:51,399
Hello, Boss.

140
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,409
What? "Boss"?

141
00:08:57,409 --> 00:08:59,080
Dae Woong, were you...

142
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,080
behind all of this?

143
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:05,649
That capable accountant told me
that he wants to work elsewhere,

144
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:09,720
so I just introduced him
to a smart lawyer, that's all.

145
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,139
I'll announce the verdict.

146
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,340
What the defendant did...

147
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,210
to protect herself and her child...

148
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,450
from domestic violence
doesn't fall...

149
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,149
within the range of what is
considered appropriate.

150
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,549
What she did can't be
accepted socially,

151
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:42,889
and therefore,
it can't be considered self-defense.

152
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,490
Therefore, the defendant...

153
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,590
is sentenced to 20 years in prison.

154
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,429
Ms. Ha.

155
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:53,330
Ms. Ha!

156
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:04,179
Your Honor.

157
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:07,039
20 years?

158
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,909
That's more than
what the prosecution asked for.

159
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:10,750
How dare you question the verdict?

160
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,049
She was beaten and treated horribly
throughout her marriage of 10 years.

161
00:10:14,049 --> 00:10:15,990
But she killed her husband,

162
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:17,360
didn't she?

163
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,620
It makes me so furious.

164
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,490
She ran away to a shelter,
but he tracked her down...

165
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,159
and trampled on her
until her ribs broke.

166
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,629
Then he whipped her
with his belt too.

167
00:10:25,629 --> 00:10:27,529
She deserved that!

168
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:30,629
Which law firm are you from anyway?

169
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,169
She was stabbed with a knife too.

170
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:36,710
It happened while she was
trying to defend herself!

171
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,279
Are you taking her side
because you're a woman too?

172
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,820
Are you? Answer me.

173
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,919
This is precisely why you women
can't go far in this field.

174
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,960
All you do is show up in court
reeking of your perfume.

175
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,360
Why are you just standing there?
Get her out of here.

176
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,529
It's not because I'm a woman.

177
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,669
This verdict is wrong.

178
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:06,669
Hey.

179
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:09,570
I'm way above your league.

180
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,539
No one can challenge...

181
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,350
my verdicts...

182
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,149
It's not like...

183
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,820
judges are always right!

184
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:22,690
Attorney Ha Jae I...

185
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:25,320
is suspended for six months.

186
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,259
My gosh. Look at you!

187
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:32,759
Your condition is worse
than I heard it was.

188
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,269
A suspension isn't enough.

189
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,769
She should lose her license!

190
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:40,940
Her law firm must
be held responsible too.

191
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,210
I get that I was wrong to punch you,

192
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,940
but...

193
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,149
your judgement was way off,

194
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:49,850
so I don't regret my actions.

195
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,980
Attorney Ha!

196
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:59,220
I was going to go easy on you
since you're a girl,

197
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:01,590
but you asked for it.

198
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:05,200
I'll put you jail
for assaulting a judge!

199
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,730
- Sir, please reconsider.
- Attorney Ha!

200
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,700
Write an apology...

201
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,740
on the Lawyer's Association website
under your real name.

202
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,850
- Hold on.
- That day...

203
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:23,909
Don't.

204
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:25,379
Sit back down.

205
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:26,720
Look at her!

206
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:29,149
I did...

207
00:12:32,659 --> 00:12:34,259
nothing wrong.

208
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:38,399
As a lawyer and as a woman,

209
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:39,629
I'm...

210
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:42,629
really annoyed.

211
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,740
Understood?

212
00:13:09,429 --> 00:13:10,960
Are you the attorney, Bong Sang Pil?

213
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,129
Yes, that's me.

214
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,330
Here you go.

215
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,570
Who sent this?

216
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:22,070
I don't know.
I'm just a delivery guy.

217
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,450
(Your employment
has been terminated.)

218
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:04,779
(April 2, 2018, Daehan Law Firm)

219
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:19,299
The trial of Detective Oh,
a murder suspect...

220
00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:21,429
in the killing of
mayor of Kiseong Lee Hyun Soo,

221
00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:23,700
will be held at
the Kiseong District Court.

222
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,500
The presiding judge will be
Judge Cha Moon Sook,

223
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,169
who is known to have turned down...

224
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:31,909
the appointment for
Supreme Court three times.

225
00:14:31,909 --> 00:14:35,409
Detective Oh has been
denying all allegations.

226
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,519
Boss, it's me.

227
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:56,629
I...

228
00:14:58,269 --> 00:15:00,139
want to open a law firm in Kiseong.

229
00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:04,840
Is this the time
you've been referring to?

230
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:12,179
Someone sent me this.

231
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,919
Is this why you're going there?

232
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:21,389
No,

233
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,789
that's not the only reason.

234
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:25,559
Then what?

235
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,330
Is it because of her?

236
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:36,139
Yes.

237
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,210
Take the boys. I'll keep funding...

238
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,450
I appreciate the offer,

239
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:43,850
but I'm going alone.

240
00:15:44,179 --> 00:15:45,519
You sure are stubborn.

241
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,389
Like mother, like son.

242
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,220
I'm sorry, sir.

243
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:56,460
It really hurts to
hear you call me that today.

244
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:58,759
Sang Pil!

245
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:03,029
Yes, Uncle Dae Woong.

246
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,200
Let's drink.

247
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:29,029
I want to be as just as you,

248
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:33,600
but it's too darn difficult
to live like that.

249
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,440
What do I tell him?

250
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,809
I'm sorry, Dad.

251
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:29,789
"Time cures everything."

252
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:36,329
That's said by those
who haven't suffered in life.

253
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,500
(Episode 1)

254
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,539
(Welcome to Kiseong.)

255
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,650
I've never seen
fog like this before.

256
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:03,349
It's like I'm up in the skies.

257
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,500
After my mom died,

258
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:23,569
my clock stopped.

259
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,049
Listen to me...

260
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:33,980
very carefully, okay?

261
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,789
Don't ever...

262
00:18:38,259 --> 00:18:39,990
come back to Kiseong.

263
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:43,890
Don't trust anyone from here.

264
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:46,599
Do you understand?
Don't trust anyone.

265
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:53,900
The world of judges
has been dominated by men.

266
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,069
According to a newspaper in Asia
that's the equivalent of "Dimes",

267
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:59,710
there's a female judge
of worldwide reputation...

268
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,210
in Kiseong.

269
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,009
She's Judge Cha Moon Sook,

270
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:05,319
and she's joining us today
for the first time in a while.

271
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:07,519
Hello, I'm Cha Moon Sook.

272
00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:10,150
- Thank you for having me.
- I didn't know...

273
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,519
she was acknowledged
by the newspaper.

274
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:13,589
What's wrong?

275
00:19:13,589 --> 00:19:14,990
Does hearing it in Kiseong...

276
00:19:15,089 --> 00:19:17,559
make her name carry more weight?

277
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:18,559
Oh, gosh.

278
00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:22,200
It's an honor.

279
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,940
I think of it as encouragement...

280
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,009
for me to devote myself
to the law and justice.

281
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,740
This train will arrive...

282
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,039
at Kiseong Station shortly.

283
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,910
To those getting off
at Kiseong Station, have a nice day.

284
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:12,420
Thank you.

285
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,380
(Daeho Stationary)

286
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:50,950
The office on the fifth floor
is occupied by a loan shark.

287
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:53,220
They've been preying on locals.

288
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:56,630
Gathering from the tricks they use,
they're low-class thugs.

289
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:00,599
Look at this! What a sweet ride.

290
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:02,029
It's shiny.

291
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,900
With a fresh coat of wax,
we could get 40,000 dollars.

292
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,940
- Let's take out that loan.
- Nice!

293
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,769
What can we throw
to cold, hungry wolves?

294
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:10,769
Sorry?

295
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,309
Are you thinking about
driving them out?

296
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:17,509
This is where
I'm setting up my office.

297
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,450
But this is a 40-year-old building.

298
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:22,049
It could collapse any day.

299
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,119
Sang Pil,
I'll get the tools and follow you!

300
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:28,829
Where should we go?

301
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,259
- Haeundae!
- Haeundae!

302
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:31,359
Where should we go?

303
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:32,559
- Hawaii!
- Hawaii!

304
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,700
You're also going to...

305
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,930
- Jeju Island!
- Jeju Island!

306
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,170
I'm also going to...

307
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,900
- Hawaii!
- Hawaii!

308
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,200
We have a customer.

309
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,700
- Hawaii!
- Hawaii!

310
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,740
Enough already.

311
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,170
- Hawaii!
- Hawaii!

312
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,410
You are all crazy.

313
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,009
So,
you're our first customer today.

314
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:48,650
How much do you want?

315
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:51,180
I don't think you're not
that desperate.

316
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:54,990
Well, everyone has their
own little story anyway.

317
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,019
Geum Kang...

318
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:58,720
Is it your name?

319
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,670
Nothing has changed here.

320
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,940
(Bong Sang Pil)

321
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:27,819
(Bong Sang Pil)

322
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,289
(Bong Sang...)

323
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:39,900
Why did you engrave my name here?

324
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,170
I'm...

325
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,369
going to come back here
at any cost.

326
00:22:48,069 --> 00:22:49,240
I'm sorry, my son.

327
00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:51,579
Because I have no money,

328
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,680
we have to move again.

329
00:22:55,549 --> 00:22:58,450
It's okay.
I heard it's a life experience.

330
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:00,920
My son!

331
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,490
I almost forgot.

332
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,660
- Mom!
- Yes?

333
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:12,960
Look at this!

334
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,000
Sang Pil, what's this?

335
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,640
You're a lawyer,

336
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,200
and lawyers must always win.

337
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,470
Bong Sang Pil, you're so smart.

338
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:26,039
When I grow up,
I'm going to be a lawyer too.

339
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:27,779
Are you sure?

340
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:30,180
But, how can a lawyer fight?

341
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:32,819
A lawyer has no sword or gun.

342
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:34,220
If you're a lawyer,

343
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:35,920
you have to fight with the law.

344
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:37,650
With the law?

345
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,859
In court,

346
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,759
a lawyer is a person
who has to fight only with the law.

347
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:44,859
That's what a lawyer is.

348
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:47,000
- With the law?
- Of course.

349
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:57,640
With the law.

350
00:23:58,539 --> 00:23:59,640
You in a suit!

351
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,579
What are you here for?

352
00:24:02,849 --> 00:24:03,980
Didn't you come here for money?

353
00:24:04,349 --> 00:24:07,279
You all need to move out
from this place.

354
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,319
"Move out"?

355
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,059
Be quiet!

356
00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:15,329
Where do you want me
to move out from?

357
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,589
Move out of this office.

358
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,559
"This office"?

359
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:21,569
(Daily installment loan)

360
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,769
Did you see ghosts
or something at sea?

361
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:29,109
Why are you acting up in my office?

362
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:33,180
I hoped you could understand me
at once.

363
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,579
But it was not that easy.
Don't you agree?

364
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:36,680
Close the door!

365
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,920
What's this?
Are you kidding me?

366
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,460
(Ha's Photo Studio)

367
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,740
Welcome.

368
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,980
Look who's here.

369
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:13,220
Are you Attorney Ha?

370
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:14,720
What were you doing?

371
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:16,519
I was doing what I always do.

372
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:19,160
Goodness.

373
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:23,430
The noodles are so soggy.
I don't know how you eat it.

374
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:26,529
When you reheat it,
it's even more tasty.

375
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:28,430
And it's quite filling too.

376
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:41,079
Aren't you curious why I came
home in all of a sudden?

377
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,210
No, I'm not.

378
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,079
Dad...

379
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,920
Even if I got fired from my job,

380
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,390
you wouldn't mind that much.

381
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:53,690
Jae I...

382
00:25:54,089 --> 00:25:57,329
Later, there will be a trial
by Judge Cha Moon Sook.

383
00:25:57,329 --> 00:25:58,329
Do you want to go with me?

384
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:01,299
Should I?

385
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,640
What did you do with Sang Pil?

386
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,200
I'm still constipated.

387
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,069
I might have to get an endoscopy.

388
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,710
Mr. Tae!

389
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,109
Sang Pil.

390
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,579
- You were so slow.
- Are you okay?

391
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,880
- We worked everything out already.
- Really?

392
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,220
Sir...

393
00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:25,759
What should I call him?

394
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:29,589
When I'm absent,
talk with Mr. Tae, the director.

395
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,660
"The director"?

396
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:33,599
Is he that famous...

397
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,299
director?

398
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:40,500
What's going on?

399
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:44,039
Mr. Bong decided to
hire all of us.

400
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,380
Dae Woong Gang,
the Kiseong Branch!

401
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,410
From today, I'm going to serve you,
Mr. Tae.

402
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:51,750
What?

403
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,019
Welcome to the city of fog,
Kiseong!

404
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,619
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

405
00:26:57,789 --> 00:26:59,859
(Daily Installment Loan)

406
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:35,490
I know why you came home.

407
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:36,589
Dad, what happened was...

408
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,029
I'm sorry.

409
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:44,200
I'm embarrassed to meet Judge Cha.

410
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:48,140
She'll understand me.

411
00:27:48,609 --> 00:27:50,569
Good for you.

412
00:27:58,619 --> 00:28:00,480
Do you still have bitter feelings
about Yeon Hee?

413
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:04,019
I heard dads love their daughters
so blindly.

414
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,619
But how unfortunate to have you
as my dad.

415
00:28:07,259 --> 00:28:09,589
We don't need another blind lover
in our family.

416
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,230
I guess so,
since I love you so blindly.

417
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:19,240
Please stand for the judge.

418
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:33,750
Please be seated.

419
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:41,460
I can see that many people came
today too.

420
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:45,730
This city is the most righteous city
in the nation.

421
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:51,200
Because the citizens of Kiseong
have a lot of interest in the law,

422
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,470
I'm always nervous.

423
00:28:55,509 --> 00:28:58,809
Today's case is about
a married woman,

424
00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:02,509
who feared for her life after
putting up with...

425
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,349
years of domestic violence,

426
00:29:05,349 --> 00:29:07,349
and killed her husband.

427
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:11,549
I've been a judge in Kiseong
for 30 years,

428
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:16,160
but the moment of announcing
a verdict is still very difficult.

429
00:29:16,529 --> 00:29:17,859
I will announce my verdict.

430
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,339
The legal interests that are
infringed by domestic violence...

431
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,440
can't be superior to life.

432
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:34,279
Any violence can't be obstructed
by murder.

433
00:29:35,779 --> 00:29:37,809
However, I have a different ruling.

434
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,190
Because of violence by men,
whose physiques are superior,

435
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:45,890
women can't find any ways
to deal with such violence.

436
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:49,990
A woman, who has been tamed
by constant violence,

437
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,759
usually gives up her life...

438
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:54,259
for the sake of her children.

439
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:58,269
To get away
from inhumane violence,

440
00:29:58,869 --> 00:30:01,940
the defendant had to make
such a radical decision.

441
00:30:02,109 --> 00:30:05,240
And I'm not capable of
finding her guilty.

442
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:11,079
This case is about a human being,
who feared for her life...

443
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,720
and had no other choice
in order to stay alive,

444
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,450
thus deeming this as self-defense.

445
00:30:18,589 --> 00:30:21,259
Therefore, I find the defendant...

446
00:30:21,859 --> 00:30:23,690
not guilty.

447
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,579
It was impressive as expected.

448
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:46,119
Judge Cha is like the Mother Teresa
of Kiseong.

449
00:30:46,819 --> 00:30:49,220
I knew it.
She's incredible.

450
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,789
She hasn't changed at all
for such a long time.

451
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,289
Dad, talent must be important
in this area.

452
00:30:57,259 --> 00:30:58,289
Who are you getting a call from?

453
00:30:58,289 --> 00:30:59,630
No one.

454
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:01,460
There'll be a customer
in the photo studio.

455
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,369
You should meet Judge Cha
to say hello.

456
00:31:03,369 --> 00:31:05,769
On the way home, get some
groceries and take your time.

457
00:31:05,869 --> 00:31:08,069
- Dad!
- I heard about you.

458
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,869
I heard you've been disbarred.

459
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:13,609
I wasn't disbarred.
Unfortunately, I was just suspended.

460
00:31:13,609 --> 00:31:16,880
As a lawyer, you should've
legitimately dealt with misjudgment.

461
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:18,880
- I didn't know you'd use violence.
- I know.

462
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:22,920
I should've dealt with it elegantly,
but I guess I'm too energetic.

463
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,220
It's a good thing
that you're energetic.

464
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:27,059
It means you have a pure heart.

465
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:29,460
Judge Cha,
you were inspirational today.

466
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,759
When did you get here?

467
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,359
Is it because of that incident?

468
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:34,799
She was daring enough
to punch a judge.

469
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,569
I believe that
the judge made a mistake.

470
00:31:38,769 --> 00:31:40,940
Don't feel defeated
just because you were suspended.

471
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,640
Holding back when you shouldn't...

472
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,480
is the same as losing.
You know that, right?

473
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,410
Of course.

474
00:31:48,509 --> 00:31:49,710
Ma'am, we should go.

475
00:32:01,089 --> 00:32:03,690
- That's right!
- Run along!

476
00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:06,400
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking the photos down.

477
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,869
They're not in business,
so move along.

478
00:32:10,299 --> 00:32:12,240
- What do you mean you can't?
- Dad!

479
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,369
Darn!

480
00:32:13,369 --> 00:32:15,170
- Dad!
- Pay back the loan.

481
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:16,910
You can't hold out.

482
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,039
Stop it!

483
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:20,779
Girls should step outside.

484
00:32:20,779 --> 00:32:22,609
Despite my looks,

485
00:32:22,779 --> 00:32:24,849
I'm known as a gentleman
in this line of work.

486
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:26,849
"Girl"?

487
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,720
What...

488
00:32:30,289 --> 00:32:32,890
Do you want to get beaten up by one?

489
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:34,759
You have me trembling.

490
00:32:35,529 --> 00:32:37,630
Lady, step outside.

491
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:41,099
My concern is only with
this nasty debtor.

492
00:32:41,299 --> 00:32:43,230
"A nasty debtor"?

493
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,200
Are you thugs or loan sharks?

494
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,809
I get that spicy food
has its appeal,

495
00:32:49,869 --> 00:32:51,910
but due to tighter laws,

496
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:54,839
some details can't be
discussed with third parties.

497
00:32:55,109 --> 00:32:56,309
- "Laws"?
- Yes.

498
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,920
You see,

499
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:04,119
I'm a lawyer. Get it?

500
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,190
"A lawyer"?

501
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:08,960
That means you understand the law.

502
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,660
Then you should step outside.

503
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:14,000
I don't want to violate
the information privacy law.

504
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:18,869
Dad.

505
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,839
Did you borrow money
from those jerks?

506
00:33:22,069 --> 00:33:23,309
- It's...
- Tell me!

507
00:33:23,309 --> 00:33:25,980
Since you're a lawyer,

508
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,109
you can explain to your dad
what's going on.

509
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,849
We'll be back soon.

510
00:33:30,309 --> 00:33:31,650
Pay your interest.

511
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:33,049
Let's go!

512
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,920
- Sure thing.
- I got myself a radish.

513
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:37,089
Dad.

514
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:39,289
What's going on?

515
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:42,160
What on earth is this?

516
00:33:46,099 --> 00:33:49,069
(Daily installment loan)

517
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:56,710
- Good job.
- We're throwing these away.

518
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:58,240
Sure thing.

519
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,210
Be careful over there.

520
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:01,680
- Hurry up.
- What is all this?

521
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,609
- Over here.
- You should've cleaned them sooner.

522
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,019
I'll do it right away.

523
00:34:06,019 --> 00:34:07,750
- Shut up while you work.
- Yes, sir.

524
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:09,719
- I'll clean this up.
- This is unbelievable.

525
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:10,820
Darn.

526
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:12,860
Why is it so dirty here?

527
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,320
Focus, will you?

528
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,130
Check if you have them.

529
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,590
Put those up there.

530
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,329
Sir!

531
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,429
Wait!

532
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:23,500
You can't just barge in here!

533
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,000
Are you the owner of this place?

534
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,010
Your first words to me
seem to have thorns in them.

535
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:31,369
Unpaid interests...

536
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:34,039
doesn't justify
vandalizing or larceny.

537
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:35,380
Darn it.

538
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:39,320
I can't file charges for
assault with a few pieces of paper.

539
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,550
You're very clever
with your use of violence.

540
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,219
The law was revised this year.

541
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,519
An interest rate of...

542
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:48,190
a financial contract
can't exceed 24 percent.

543
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:51,130
Did you think you could
get away with 45 percent?

544
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,500
Fine.

545
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,400
Article eight of registration
of credit business...

546
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,530
and protection of finance users.

547
00:34:56,869 --> 00:34:58,070
I will revise it.

548
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:00,570
An interest rate could be unfair,

549
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:02,639
but that doesn't
give you the right...

550
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:05,170
to not meet the repayment deadline.

551
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,880
I bet this isn't
a registered business.

552
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,550
Should I call the police?

553
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,610
Call 1332.

554
00:35:10,949 --> 00:35:13,949
Call the contact center of
the Financial Supervisory Service.

555
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,619
All advisers are busy at the moment.

556
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:22,019
Not willing to repay money
that was properly lent...

557
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:23,429
by accusing it of being illegal...

558
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:26,400
is audaciously immoral.

559
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:29,429
In this case,
you're also blackmailing us.

560
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,300
What?

561
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:34,400
I heard you got suspended
for punching a judge.

562
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:38,510
Don't add to your charges,

563
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,880
or you'll get your license revoked.

564
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,510
How did you know that?

565
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:46,480
Did you do a background check on me?

566
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,820
I only do that...

567
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,719
with women I'm interested in.

568
00:35:57,389 --> 00:35:59,429
Why you obnoxious jerk!

569
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,099
Be a bit gentler.

570
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,440
I'm not one to step
into this place easily.

571
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,340
The victim won't settle.

572
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:14,039
Detective, wait!

573
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,349
I want to press charges
on that loan shark too!

574
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:19,420
You lot!

575
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,780
Is this how you've been
doing business?

576
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:25,820
You guys have nothing, but you
leech onto those who are worse off?

577
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:27,519
What else could we do?

578
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:29,389
We had to make a living.

579
00:36:30,489 --> 00:36:32,190
Also, Ha's Photo Studio...

580
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,300
That's enough.

581
00:36:35,699 --> 00:36:38,000
They only wanted
to feed their mouths too.

582
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,170
I'm sorry.

583
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:43,610
We only agreed to become
members of this gang...

584
00:36:43,909 --> 00:36:47,010
because you promised
that we'd make a living.

585
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:48,380
Do you know...

586
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,150
what this is?

587
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,280
She's the lady in a blindfold.

588
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,980
I saw her at my trial.

589
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,250
Bingo.

590
00:36:55,989 --> 00:36:57,250
Sit down.

591
00:37:00,789 --> 00:37:03,289
This place will no longer be
a loan office.

592
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,389
We will be a law firm.

593
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:07,659
"A law firm"?

594
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,570
That's right. He's a lawyer.

595
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:14,639
- What a joke.
- That's hilarious!

596
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,610
Hold on.

597
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:20,539
It's the truth. He's not kidding!

598
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,250
From this day on,

599
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,719
you'll be living
completely different lives.

600
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:28,719
You, who have been
breaking the law,

601
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:31,449
will join me and go around it.

602
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:32,460
Simply speaking,

603
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,860
you'll now defeat the law.

604
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,230
We've been ignoring the law
for quite some time now.

605
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,269
Don't ignore it any more.

606
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,070
Beat it.

607
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:47,070
- Yes, sir!
- From now on,

608
00:37:48,469 --> 00:37:49,909
he's Attorney Bong.

609
00:37:49,909 --> 00:37:52,039
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

(Choi Jin Ae Law Firm)

611
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,429
Mom, where were you?

612
00:38:42,889 --> 00:38:43,989
Sang Pil?

613
00:38:45,929 --> 00:38:48,730
What are you doing here?
I told you to stay home.

614
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:50,269
I came because I missed you.

615
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:52,269
You can't be here.

616
00:39:02,409 --> 00:39:04,079
Listen to me...

617
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,750
- very carefully, okay?
- Mom?

618
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,230
This...

619
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:25,469
is your uncle's address.

620
00:39:27,869 --> 00:39:29,739
This is him.

621
00:39:31,409 --> 00:39:33,139
Since when did I have an uncle?

622
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,050
If...

623
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:42,550
anything happens to me,

624
00:39:43,019 --> 00:39:45,650
go find your uncle in Seoul. Got it?

625
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,559
What about you?

626
00:39:49,829 --> 00:39:50,929
Listen to me...

627
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:52,800
very carefully, okay?

628
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,059
Don't ever...

629
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,329
come back to Kiseong.

630

Don't trust anyone from here.

631
00:40:02,139 --> 00:40:03,210
Do you understand?

632
00:40:03,469 --> 00:40:04,769
Don't trust anyone.

633
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:06,710
Remember...

634
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:08,940
what I said.

635
00:40:10,949 --> 00:40:12,519
Don't ever come back here.

636
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,480

(Daeho Stationary)

638

Hey, Ms. Lawyer.

639
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:43,809
Just do your job...

640
00:40:43,809 --> 00:40:45,309
and focus on your trials.

641
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:48,150
Why would you overstep your
boundaries and risk your life?

642
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,889
Shut your mouth.

643
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,630
Where's the memory card?

644
00:40:59,829 --> 00:41:01,030
There's no such thing.

645
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:08,639
You don't have it? Are you sure?

646
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:13,139
- Answer me.
- I don't have it!

647
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:18,809
All right, okay.

648
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,650
If you say so, I should...

649
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:28,719
believe you.

650
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,260
Are we good now?

651
00:41:35,329 --> 00:41:36,429
It's all right.

652
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:40,400
But I'm wondering...

653
00:41:43,409 --> 00:41:44,769
It looks like there's
someone else here.

654

Kiddo.

655
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,380
Kiddo, come on out!

00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:57,619
Shut it! My son isn't here.

658
00:41:57,889 --> 00:42:02,289
I said your mom will be in deep
trouble if you don't come out.

659
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:06,130
I can't promise you
that she'll be okay.

660
00:42:08,699 --> 00:42:09,900
I'll count to three.

661
00:42:10,369 --> 00:42:11,469
Just to three, okay?

662
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:13,670
One.

663
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:16,110
Two.

664
00:42:20,139 --> 00:42:21,239
Three.

665
00:42:21,809 --> 00:42:23,179
Leave my mom alone!

666
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,119
Sang Pil.

667
00:42:30,219 --> 00:42:31,949
No, let go!

668
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:33,690
No, don't do this!

669
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,460
Stop, please!

670
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,130
Let go of me, you jerks!

671
00:42:46,269 --> 00:42:48,840
- You're a good boy.
- Don't lay a finger on my son.

672
00:42:49,739 --> 00:42:51,070
- You're cute.
- Don't touch him!

673
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,139
Don't touch me.

674
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,539
Let me ask you one last time.

675
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:00,949
Where's that memory card?

676
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:03,789
I don't know.

677
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,320
Really?

678
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:12,030
Well, if that's the case...

679
00:43:13,059 --> 00:43:16,369
This kid didn't even do
anything wrong,

680
00:43:17,329 --> 00:43:18,329
right?

681
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:20,739
No. No, don't.

682
00:43:20,739 --> 00:43:23,510
Don't! Don't hurt him! Please, no...

683
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:25,909
Okay, I'll give it to you.

684
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:45,059
Yes, sir. Where are you now?

685
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:47,900
I found it.

686
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:51,730
What would you like me to do
about the lawyer and her son?

687
00:44:03,949 --> 00:44:05,010
Hey, kiddo.

688
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:06,980
Did you swallow it? Open your mouth.

689
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:09,349
Open your mouth! You little...

690
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:16,429
Look at this kid.
I must say, your son is... Goodness.

691
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:19,960
I'm an impatient man.
I can't wait until he poops it out.

692
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,329
- Hey, give me a knife.
- No.

693
00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:23,630
- Hurry up.
- No, don't. You can't do that!

694
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:25,869
Let go of me, please. Don't do that!

695
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,239
Let go!

696
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:28,900
Please... Don't hurt him!

697
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,210
- Let go.
- No, don't hurt him!

698
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,880
No! Sang Pil, run. Run away!

699
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,849
- No, Sang Pil. Run!
- Gosh, this woman...

700
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:39,179
Mom.

701
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,119
Mom!

702
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:08,780
Hey, turn on the lights.

703
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:11,880
(Daeho Stationary)

704
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:22,590
He's gone!

705
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:24,289
I think he just slipped out.

706
00:45:24,829 --> 00:45:26,030
- Just now...
- Come on.

707
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:27,159
Let's go find that kid.

708
00:45:40,179 --> 00:45:41,539
Look in every nook and cranny!

709
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:42,639
Yes, sir!

710
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:19,179
Detective, those men killed my mom.

711
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,679
What? Some men killed your mom?
Who are they?

712
00:46:22,849 --> 00:46:23,989
That man!

713
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:27,090
Did you see that man...

714
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:29,760
killing your mom with your own eyes?

715
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,059
Yes, I did. I saw everything.

716
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:37,000
Hyung Man, grab a hold of that kid.

717
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,730
I need to get something out of him.

718
00:46:41,539 --> 00:46:43,639
Detective Wu, did something happen?

719
00:46:43,639 --> 00:46:45,239
No, it's nothing.

720
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:46,440
Go. Continue along.

721
00:46:48,409 --> 00:46:50,079
Hey, I can't find it anywhere.

722
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:51,909
Where did he hide the memory card?

723
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:53,750
That kid swallowed it.

724
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,920
Get it out before I take care
of him myself. It's important.

725
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,019
Then what about the woman?

726
00:47:00,219 --> 00:47:02,159
Bury her with the kid.

727
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:06,800
All right.

728
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,840
Hey,
did you guys tie her limbs properly?

729
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,570
Yes, we did, sir.

730
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:18,769
Hey, it's over there. Make a left.

731
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:19,840
What's this?

732
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,510
Let go!

733
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,010
You little brat.

734
00:47:57,650 --> 00:47:58,909
You're so dead.

735
00:48:00,619 --> 00:48:01,650
Run.

736
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:02,920
Get back here, you rat!

737
00:48:03,849 --> 00:48:05,550
- Hurry!
- Stop!

738
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:08,420
- Run!
- Stop...

739
00:48:20,699 --> 00:48:22,300
Come at me all you want, you jerks.

740
00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:46,530
- Mister.
- Hey, wait.

741
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,230
Take this and buy yourself
something to eat.

742
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,469
Choi Jin Ae!

743
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:00,840
What did you just say?

744
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:04,150
Say it again. Who?

745
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,679
Choi Jin Ae.

746
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:10,150
How do you know Jin Ae?

747
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:11,849
She's my mom.

748
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:22,059
Your mom and I...

749
00:49:23,329 --> 00:49:25,369
cut all ties with each other
a long time ago.

750
00:49:26,869 --> 00:49:27,900
Leave.

751
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:30,840
My mom died.

752
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:39,750
Those men...

753
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:43,550
killed my mom right in front
of my eyes.

754
00:50:09,949 --> 00:50:11,250
All right.

755
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:13,550
Let's eat.

756
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:18,250
Uncle Dae Woong.

757
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:22,219
Yes?

758
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:24,829
You're a gangster who earns money
by beating people up, right?

759
00:50:31,699 --> 00:50:32,829
Yes, you're right.

760
00:50:33,769 --> 00:50:36,710
Then, please teach me
how to fight like you.

761
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:39,269
Why?

762
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:42,639
Do you want to get back at the guys
who did that to your mom?

763
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:48,619
Your mom has been keeping away
from me because I was in a gang.

764
00:50:48,949 --> 00:50:51,349
But you want me to make you
a gang like me?

765
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:53,489
I'll never do that.

766
00:50:54,489 --> 00:50:56,289
I promised my mom.

767
00:50:56,289 --> 00:50:58,429
I told her I'll be a lawyer
when I grow up.

768
00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:00,460
That's a good idea.

769
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:02,599
Try to be a lawyer and
don't think about anything else.

770
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:03,969
But my mom told me...

771
00:51:03,969 --> 00:51:06,269
not to come back to Kiseong
whatsoever.

772
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,300
But I'm...

773
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,409
going to come back to Kiseong
when I get stronger.

774
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:24,849
All the truths...

775
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:26,690
are here inside.

776
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,429
Sang Pil!

777
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:34,500
You promised me.

778
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:37,170
You told me you'll be
a good lawyer like me.

779
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:42,170
You have to keep that promise.

780
00:51:43,539 --> 00:51:45,340
I'll be watching over you.

781
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:47,139
I mean it.

782
00:52:00,289 --> 00:52:02,960
(Kiseong Police Station)

783
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:08,500
(Homicide Team 2)

784
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:11,769
Let go of me!

785
00:52:11,769 --> 00:52:13,070
- Mr. Tae!
- Yes.

786
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,480
What's this?

787
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:30,750
Why are you here to see me?

788
00:52:30,949 --> 00:52:32,389
I'm not visiting you.

789
00:52:32,389 --> 00:52:33,820
(Interviewer)

790
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:35,690
I'm here to interview you.

791
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,260
You're interviewing me?
What for?

792
00:52:38,429 --> 00:52:39,659
It's an interview for
the position of a paralegal.

793
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:42,599
I chose you as the prime candidate
for the position.

794
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:45,099
Hey...

795
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:48,769
Do you know what kind of job
a paralegal does?

796
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:51,739
Can you see this?

797
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:55,210
I'm a lawyer too.

798
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,510
Your father is liable to me
for debts.

799
00:52:58,510 --> 00:52:59,980
But, there's no way for him
to pay the debt.

800
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:02,980
One option is to make you sign the
disclaimer of your body.

801
00:53:03,219 --> 00:53:05,750
That's too ungentlemanly of me
though.

802
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:07,889
So, work hard as a paralegal,

803
00:53:07,889 --> 00:53:09,889
and settle your debt
fairly and squarely.

804
00:53:09,889 --> 00:53:11,690
What did you say?
You want me to be a paralegal?

805
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,760
- Hello, I'm a lawyer.
- I see.

806
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:19,530
You got suspended
by knocking out a judge,

807
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:20,900
and now you're jobless.

808
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:23,809
You run an illegal loan company,

809
00:53:23,809 --> 00:53:25,539
and you do illegal
background checks.

810
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:27,380
You're trash.

811
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:30,150
It might be refreshing
to punch a judge out of anger...

812
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:33,210
because you didn't do your job
as a lawyer and lost your case.

813
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,980
But what happened to your client?

814
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:37,750
Watch what you say to me.

815
00:53:38,389 --> 00:53:40,659
You don't have the right to judge me
as I have no idea...

816
00:53:40,659 --> 00:53:42,289
whether you're a lawyer
or a gangster.

817
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,860
I saw many lawyers like you,

818
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:47,159
those who regard their clients
as not human beings,

819
00:53:47,159 --> 00:53:48,659
but as their meal tickets.

820
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:50,570
I'm not a good lawyer,

821
00:53:50,869 --> 00:53:53,469
but I'm a lawyer that
someone might need.

822
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:56,199
You must be helpful to those
who are wealthy and guilty.

823
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:59,639
They're the people who are likely
to need the best legal service.

824
00:53:59,639 --> 00:54:02,539
Why did you become a lawyer then?
You should've become a gangster.

825
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:03,849
Why did you study law?

826
00:54:03,849 --> 00:54:06,110
You need to know the law
if you want to violate the law.

827
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:07,250
Didn't you know that?

828
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:12,719
Well, I'll be the one to ask
questions from now on.

829
00:54:13,019 --> 00:54:14,860
I'm here not to visit you,
but to interview you.

830
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:17,659
And I might become your employer.

831
00:54:17,989 --> 00:54:19,159
I'll give you an option.

832
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:22,360
If you do a good job as a paralegal,
your suspension will end.

833
00:54:22,599 --> 00:54:24,869
Then I'll hire you as a partner
in my firm.

834
00:54:24,869 --> 00:54:26,900
Me? Why?

835
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:29,340
Why would I become your partner?

836
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:31,840
A woman who has a loud voice
and is as violent as you,

837
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,510
is perfect for the position
of my paralegal.

838
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:37,349
I'll inform you with the result
of the interview right away.

839
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:41,780
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

840
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:52,289
Ms. Ha... Okay. You may go.

841
00:54:52,989 --> 00:54:54,329
You have quite the backer.

842
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,230
Where did you find him?

843
00:55:04,739 --> 00:55:06,980
Congratulations! You got
the position as my paralegal.

844
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:08,480
What the...

845
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,079
Darn.

846
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:15,650
My gosh.

847
00:55:21,019 --> 00:55:22,860
You told Judge Cha?

848
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,260
At a time like this,

849
00:55:24,889 --> 00:55:27,530
who can help us...

850
00:55:27,929 --> 00:55:29,730
except Judge Cha?

851
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:31,800
Why did you do that?

852
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:35,300
Goodness.
Because of that photo studio,

853
00:55:35,739 --> 00:55:37,769
I sent my daughter to jail.

854
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:41,539
And I had to tell such an
embarrassing story to Judge Cha.

855
00:55:42,679 --> 00:55:45,179
Let's close the studio.

856
00:55:45,409 --> 00:55:47,119
I won't agree with it.

857
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:48,780
I'll close it.

858
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:52,250
So, I can pay all the debts.

859
00:55:53,289 --> 00:55:54,420
What about Mom?

860
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,989
What are you going to do
about Mom?

861
00:55:57,659 --> 00:55:59,789
You said you wouldn't move
the studio...

862
00:56:00,159 --> 00:56:03,630
because if we do,
Mom won't be able to find us.

863
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,030
Jae I...

864
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:10,340
I'm sorry.

865
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:13,070
I'm so sorry.

866
00:56:20,579 --> 00:56:23,449
In order to make sure
you graduated from law school,

867
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:25,550
I loaned some money.

868
00:56:25,789 --> 00:56:29,489
This is what a father should do
to his daughter.

869
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:31,489
I'll take care of everything.

870
00:56:31,489 --> 00:56:33,230
So, don't worry.

871
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:34,300
Ha Jae I!

872
00:56:37,369 --> 00:56:39,969
Go away.
I don't want to talk to you now.

873
00:56:39,969 --> 00:56:41,940
Then, you might not
want to hear this news either.

874
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:43,940
I vouched for you.

875
00:56:44,510 --> 00:56:46,940
- What?
- Judge Cha asked me to do it.

876
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,409
It was her request to me.

877
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:51,349
If that is true...

878
00:56:52,579 --> 00:56:54,420
- I want to...
- Don't thank me.

879
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:56,579
I had no choice
because Judge Cha asked me.

880
00:56:58,019 --> 00:56:59,420
All right. Bye.

881
00:57:00,119 --> 00:57:03,019
- Dad! We're home.
- What?

882
00:57:03,829 --> 00:57:05,989
We're here now, Dad.

883
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:07,900
That was fast.

884
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:09,659
That's good enough.

885
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:11,099
(Lawless Law Firm)

886
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,340
- Goodness...
- Hello.

887
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:20,010
Congratulations with
your first day of work.

888
00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:22,480
Your first day was supposed to be
a week ago.

889
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:25,380
It doesn't matter anyway.

890
00:57:26,349 --> 00:57:29,750
Well then, are you prepared?

891
00:57:30,389 --> 00:57:32,719
I'm going to work as much as
the debt that my dad has.

892
00:57:32,719 --> 00:57:34,289
Reduce the debt
according to my daily wage.

893
00:57:35,659 --> 00:57:38,960
What about the overdue interest
accumulating even at this hour?

894
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:43,030
I'll pay everything
as soon as possible.

895
00:57:44,329 --> 00:57:45,500
You're so quick.

896
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:48,340
When do you think this work
makes me scared?

897
00:57:48,539 --> 00:57:51,210
I'm sure it's when someone
takes out a loan and disappears.

898
00:57:51,869 --> 00:57:55,510
It's when a debtor is too
motivated like you right now.

899
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:56,510
Is that so?

900

"Lawless Law Firm's
king of lawyers".

901
00:58:04,489 --> 00:58:07,219
It suits a lawless person like you.

902
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:10,590
You shouldn't say such things
to someone who does legal service.

903
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:13,599
- Geum Kang!
- Yes, sir.

904
00:58:15,329 --> 00:58:16,329
Well...

905
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:19,070
Follow me.

906
00:58:19,469 --> 00:58:22,969
I'll tell you about the first case
that our law firm will take.

907
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:25,570
Okay.

908
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:28,179
"Paralegal".

909
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,539
See you later.

910
00:58:29,539 --> 00:58:31,050
Take care.

911
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:33,449
Hello.

912
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:37,119
Here you go.

913
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:40,260
Thank you.

914
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:46,659
(We trust in you,
who is starting a new life.)

915
00:58:51,269 --> 00:58:52,500
We're here. Get out.

916
00:59:01,409 --> 00:59:02,840
Are you seeing anybody?

917
00:59:03,409 --> 00:59:04,949
Is that what you want?

918
00:59:05,409 --> 00:59:07,619
Seeing your reaction,
I guess you aren't.

919
00:59:07,619 --> 00:59:09,880
Investigating the case
must be an excuse you made.

920
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:11,920
You're showing your true colors
as we're left alone.

921
00:59:12,019 --> 00:59:13,789
We're here for an outside duty.

922
00:59:13,789 --> 00:59:15,820
I'm here to pay off my dad's debt,

923
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:18,059
and I'm against dating my coworkers.

924
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:21,230
Dating your coworker?
That's uncomfortable.

925
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:24,829
I guess you decided to consider
our law firm as your workplace now.

926
00:59:24,829 --> 00:59:27,099
Personally, I hate lawyers like you.

927
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:29,869
I hate those who
pretend to be lawyers.

928
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:31,309
What's with
the casual language though?

929
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:33,170
Maybe it's because you punched me,

930
00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:35,139
but I feel comfortable with you.

931
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,079
I see you're keeping it up.

932
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:42,849
Fine then, Attorney Bong.

933
00:59:42,849 --> 00:59:43,849
Ms. Ha,

934
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:47,860
we already seem
to be on the same page.

935
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,869
This trial will be
a piece of cake for you,

936
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:00,340
except for three things.

937
01:00:00,469 --> 01:00:01,570
Ms. Ha?

938
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:05,769
First,
the client already has a lawyer.

939
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:06,940
It's called professional courtesy.

940
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:08,510
I don't steal clients.

941
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:10,309
It won't be easy...

942
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,780
since the lawyer used
to be a respected judge.

943
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,820
I'm surprised you know
some big words.

944
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:18,719
Second,
the prosecutor on this case...

945
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:21,619
is one of the best
Kiseong has to offer,

946
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,289
Prosecutor Kang Yeon Hee.

947
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:26,230
That doesn't give me an excuse
to reject this case.

948
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:27,530
What's the third?

949
01:00:28,699 --> 01:00:29,900
The presiding judge...

950
01:00:30,199 --> 01:00:31,929
- is Judge Cha Moon Sook.
- Really?

951
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:35,139
So it's her case.

952
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:37,539
What is the client
being accused for?

953
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:40,710
Murder.

954
01:00:41,139 --> 01:00:43,139
He's being accused of
killing Mayor Lee Young Soo.

955
01:00:44,909 --> 01:00:46,110
Here. Read it.

956
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:53,489
(Daeho Stationary)

957
01:00:53,489 --> 01:00:54,519
We're here.

958
01:01:03,829 --> 01:01:05,500
We're employees now.

959
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:12,739
Sir, how have you been?

960
01:01:13,809 --> 01:01:16,079
I called to notify you
of my arrival...

961
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:17,909
in Kiseong.

962
01:01:21,949 --> 01:01:23,150
Gwan Dong.

963
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:25,420
What brings you by?

964
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:28,219
I came to teach a lawyer a lesson.

965
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:29,920
What?

966
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:33,730
"A lawyer"?

967
01:01:38,199 --> 01:01:40,599
(Mayor Lee Young Soo Murder
Case Report)

968
01:01:41,639 --> 01:01:44,070
Why do you want
to defend this client?

969
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:46,539
The prosecutor's office
have definitive proof.

970
01:01:46,539 --> 01:01:47,710
You said you weren't interested,

971
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:49,440
but it seems you got a handle
on this case already.

972
01:01:49,639 --> 01:01:52,110
Do you owe the client a favor?

973
01:01:54,219 --> 01:01:55,619
Do I owe him a favor?

974
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:07,360
Hello, it's nice to meet you.
I'm Attorney Bong Sang Pil.

975
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:11,099
Do you know me?

976
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,800
Don't we all start off as strangers?

977
01:02:17,269 --> 01:02:19,210
Attorney Bong Sang Pil?

978
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:25,210
I want to represent you,
so you should switch lawyers.

979
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:28,179
Is this how lawyers
get clients these days?

980
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:30,889
I see you're in
desperate need of work.

981
01:02:30,889 --> 01:02:33,349
I was quite famous in Seoul.

982
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:35,719
It's a shame...

983
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:38,460
because I already have
a decent lawyer.

984
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:45,570
Did you see that man...

985
01:02:45,969 --> 01:02:48,400
killing your mom with your own eyes?

986
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:50,840
Hyung Man, grab a hold of that kid.

987
01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:53,239
I need to get something out of him.

988
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:55,809
Let go!

989
01:02:57,409 --> 01:02:58,750
Let go of me!

990
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:07,860
Detective Wu Hyung Man,

991
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:12,329
let me make you a free man.

992
01:03:40,989 --> 01:03:42,590
(Lawless Lawyer)

993
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:45,730
Hand over Detective Wu's case.

994
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:48,059
I guess I was wrong.

995
01:03:48,059 --> 01:03:49,730
You're actually...

996
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:50,769
a lot worse than I thought you'd be.

997
01:03:50,769 --> 01:03:51,969
Tell Bong Sang Pil...

998
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:53,599
that he has two options.

999
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:56,570
He can either forfeit the trial
or give up breathing all together.

1000
01:03:56,570 --> 01:03:58,940
Bong Sang Pil
doesn't follow the basics,

1001
01:03:59,110 --> 01:04:00,679
but it's hard to ignore him.

1002
01:04:01,210 --> 01:04:02,440
Are you cut out for the job...

1003
01:04:02,679 --> 01:04:03,909
of mayor of Kiseong?

1004
01:04:03,909 --> 01:04:05,710
I'll do my best, Judge Cha!

1005
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:07,420
I'm her son.

1006
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:09,179
I'll kill you...

1007
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:11,019
from outside the prison walls.
