(Lawless Lawyer)

7
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:33,969
So Attorney Bong took
Attorney Ha's mom to safety...

8
00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:36,570
while no one was watching.

9
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,179
Gosh. Could he be more amazing?

10
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,579
We were all worried
that your mother...

11
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:44,420
had died once again.

12
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,380
Congratulations, Attorney Ha.

13
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,750
Thank you all for your concern.

14
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,020
So all we need to do
is act as if her mom...

15
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,030
passed away.

16
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,090
Act?

17
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,000
That we're good at.

18
00:00:57,259 --> 00:00:58,329
Jae I,

19
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:01,770
I'm so sorry about
what happened to your mom.

20
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,269
You know what? Forget about the law.

21
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:08,540
Let's just get
our piece of Cha Moon Sook.

22
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,609
Why don't I walk up behind her...

23
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:13,650
and drag her by the hair like so?

24
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,079
I guess acting isn't for me.

25
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,019
Guys, that's enough joking around.

26
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:26,489
Let's focus at the screen.

27
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,489
Since Nam Soon Ja was arrested,

28
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:30,730
so stage one is complete.

29
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,799
It's not like we can add
wind to the fire.

30
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:36,500
Boss, should we send them
a fan instead?

31
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,200
What are you talking about?

32
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,510
It's not much, but I'd rather
pour fuel over the fire.

33
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,909
Now that we've broken Nam Soon Ja,

34
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:47,750
we can go after Cha Moon Sook.

35
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,620
Not yet.
We have other goons to take care of.

36
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,519
- Gosh.
- Oh, please.

37
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:55,049
The little fish won't matter
once we catch the big fish.

38
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:58,090
Think of when you take a dump.

39
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,689
It's much better...

40
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:01,760
to pee at the same time.

41
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,230
Did you have to say that
when I'm eating?

42
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,629
Take that!

43
00:02:05,629 --> 00:02:07,730
When I was young,

44
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,439
I used to go fishing often
with my uncle.

45
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,139
This is what he'd always said to me.

46
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:15,770
"Whenever you want
to catch a big fish,"

47
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,379
"use the smaller ones you've caught
as bait."

48
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,379
So Nam Soon Ja's the bait you'll use
to catch Cha Moon Sook?

49
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:22,509
That's right.

50
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:27,889
You. Don't you know who I am?

51
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:30,189
No, I don't know,

52
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:33,319
so just answer my questions.

53
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:36,729
Detective Gong,
let's be civil about this.

54
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:38,860
She's innocent until proven guilty.

55
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,800
This is a conspiracy.

56
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:43,370
The police should
follow the truths and facts,

57
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,370
not harass and threaten
an innocent citizen!

58
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,610
Threaten?

59
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,909
Just you wait and see!

60
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:52,710
I'll get out here in an hour
and come for all your jobs.

61
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:55,610
This is a conspiracy.
I've been framed!

62
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,949
Please sit down.

63
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,490
Did you say, "conspiracy"?

64
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:08,090
You're just as
Chief Prosecutor Jang described.

65
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,259
You play hard and fast
with a feisty spirit...

66
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,770
as you bite people
like a venomous snake.

67
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,439
Do you know how close
Chief Prosecutor Jang and I are?

68
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,909
Ms. Nam,
saying that won't work with me.

69
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,979
The proof is too damaging
to say that you were framed.

70
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:29,979
What? What's this proof?

71
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:32,120
Isn't it proof that I'm innocent?

72
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,319
Get rid of her.

73
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,090
Toss her in the sea
so no one finds her.

74
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:45,729
You want her dead?

75
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,099
Yes.

76
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,400
Do you not take me seriously?

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,370
This...

78
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:56,740
This isn't real.
Someone's framing me!

79
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:00,039
This is entrapment.
I've been framed.

80
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,819
This man killed him
and pinned it all on me!

81
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:06,949
So this is the one
who killed the Thai acupressurist?

82
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:08,689
That jerk!

83
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:12,189
This scoundrel framed
an innocent woman!

84
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,090
Fine.

85
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:16,290
Then what's his name?

86
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,100
His name?

87
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,800
Judging by the relationship,
I'm sure you know his name.

88
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:25,069
It's not like I remember
every name I come across.

89
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,670
Anyway, I want my phone call.

90
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,279
Prosecutor Chun, please allow it.

91
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:37,750
Sure.

92
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,879
We'll turn off the cameras,

93
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,350
so make that call.

94
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:01,810
Judge Cha.

95
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,370
Judge Cha, it's me.

96
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,639
Right.

97
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:10,620
I'm currently being questioned
by the prosecution.

98
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,720
- What?
- Haven't you watched the news?

99
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:20,189
That thug has framed
both you and me.

100
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:23,329
What are you talking about?

101
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,930
I'll tell you everything
when I get out,

102
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,470
so please tell me his name.

103
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:30,939
I'm going to kill that...

104
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:33,470
When do I ever remember
names of worthless people?

105
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:36,439
Sorry?

106
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:39,339
Try and figure things out
with Attorney Go.

107
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,050
- I'm sure he'll get you out.
- But...

108
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,550
I have trial to preside.

109
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,050
But Judge Cha...

110
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:02,829
Honey...

111
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,470
Honey!

112
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,240
Honey!

113
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:12,910
Honey...

114
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:14,579
Honey.

115
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,480
- Honey.
- It took me too long.

116
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,850
I'm sorry.

117
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:27,529
Finally,
my family is back as a whole.

118
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,339
My mom and my dad.

119
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,180
This notebook you sent me.

120
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:53,050
I've been having a blast with it.

121
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:55,389
You didn't write the ending though.

122
00:06:58,819 --> 00:06:59,920
And what may that be?

123
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:02,290
The end of Cha Moon Sook.

124
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,600
Right. Try your best
writing that final chapter.

125
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,870
I'm curious of it too.

126
00:07:12,269 --> 00:07:15,110
You took Jae I's mother
away from Jae I twice.

127
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,339
I'll never forgive you for that.

128
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:29,490
I had nothing to do with that.

129
00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:31,490
Also,

130
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,259
is the Thai acupressurist
really her mother?

131
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:36,990
I didn't expect...

132
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,670
to hear you spill
all the answers anyway.

133
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,600
I admit that there's something...

134
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:49,670
I didn't count when sending you...

135
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,839
that notebook.

136
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:57,009
You and Jae I getting together.

137
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,050
Your relationship with her
is what will bog you down.

138
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,490
Don't you think
it could be the opposite?

139
00:08:06,689 --> 00:08:10,089
It'll be the biggest flaw
in your elaborate plan.

140
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,660
You not anticipating
our relationship.

141
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:30,819
Hey, what's going on
with Nam Soon Ja?

142
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:33,450
Prosecutor Cheon Seung Beom
is in charge of the case.

143
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:35,919
Nam Soon Ja is doomed now.

144
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,919
Okay. Thanks.

145
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,590
Nam Soon Ja has been caught,
but An Oh Ju fled,

146
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,159
and we don't know what he'll do.

147
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:46,860
And we must not get caught
in the trap Cha Moon Sook set up.

148
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,370
What brings you here?

149
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:02,309
I heard you're in charge of a case
I'm interested in.

150
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,549
Right, so what do you
want from me this time?

151
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,950
I heard that one of the evidence
is a video clip.

152
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:12,220
Did you get it from
Chief Prosecutor Jang by any chance?

153
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,419
Did you...

154
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:15,889
plant bugs in my office or what?

155
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,700
Gosh, of course not.

156
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,500
How do you think it ended up
in Chief Prosecutor Jang's hands?

157
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,730
Have you thought about that?

158
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,299
Are you trying to say
Judge Cha is behind it?

159
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:26,370
That's right.

160
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:29,639
Why do you think Judge Cha had
such crucial evidence...

161
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:31,980
to get Nam Soon Ja convicted?

162
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,080
So...

163
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:36,049
are you saying even Judge Cha
is connected to the case?

164
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:38,950
I'd like to say this to you
instead of answering your question.

165
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:42,720
You must try to find
the hidden truth in this case...

166
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,889
with the eyes of an owl
that see through the darkness, sir.

167
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:49,590
Are you saying...

168
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,830
Cha Moon Sook probably won't
take on Nam Soon Ja's trial?

169
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:53,200
Yes.

170
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,500
She'll probably send another judge
whom she can trust.

171
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,200
Then there's only one person.

172
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:05,240
Nam Soon Ja's trial
has been assigned to you.

173
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:09,549
But I heard that the defendant...

174
00:10:10,049 --> 00:10:12,549
is someone who's
very close to you, ma'am.

175
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,549
That shouldn't affect the verdict.

176
00:10:15,289 --> 00:10:16,889
Be fair and square.

177
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,690
I understood, ma'am.

178
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,899
What a rare sight.

179
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:29,769
Guys, let's give him a big hand.

180
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,799
Why are you guys applauding me?

181
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,970
This isn't even a big deal.

182
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:37,210
I just got a sudden urge
to know more about the law.

183
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,879
- Is that right, Geum Kang?
- Yes.

184
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,879
Kwang Soo,
we work for a law firm, you know.

185
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:44,679
We should read the law books
at least once.

186
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:46,919
- My gosh.
- Study, you punks.

187
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:49,190
You'd better not get abducted again.

188
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:54,059
Well, Attorney Ha.
I have a question for you.

189
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:58,429
How would you define a good ruling?

190
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:01,200
Reading this is making me curious.

191
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,399
Very much so.

192
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:06,240
Good rulings are the ones
that even common people like you,

193
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,539
who have never studied the law,
can understand.

194
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,679
If people who don't know the law
can't understand,

195
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:12,909
wouldn't it be a bad ruling?

196
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:16,879
You sure are an attorney.

197
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:18,980
Why are you so cool?

198
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,049
Jae I, you're incredibly articulate.

199
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:25,120
Gosh, I'm already sad about
letting you have Attorney Bong.

200
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,059
So...

201
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:30,659
you're saying I don't need to read
this difficult book at all, right?

202
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,929
Thank goodness.
I was getting a huge headache.

203
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:35,669
Hey, just use it as a pillow.
That suits you much better.

204
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,169
They're preparing for
Nam Soon Ja's trial today, right?

205
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,009
Yes. They must've met by now.

206
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,039
I'll leave it in your hands.

207
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:45,909
See you later.

208
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,009
I'll see you later, Boss.

209
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,620
- Don't slack off.
- Okay.

210
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:53,980
- See you later, Kwang Soo.
- Bye.

211
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,690
What about you, Prosecutor Cheon?

212
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:01,429
I think we should look further...

213
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,289
into Evidence Number Four.

214
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,100
Is that really necessary?

215
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,029
Let's just get a statement instead.

216
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,940
I think that should be
more than sufficient.

217
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:16,210
All right.
We've covered everything, right?

218
00:12:16,539 --> 00:12:18,809
Then let's wrap up here for today.

219
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:20,639
Yes, Your Honor. Let's do that.

220
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:27,720
Oh, boy. Where did the time go?

221
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,360
Should I get a new watch?

222
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,889
My watch is not accurate.

223
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:38,029
You should get a new one.

224
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,639
Is that really you, Madam Nam?

225
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,370
I almost couldn't recognize you.

226
00:12:50,539 --> 00:12:53,279
What brings you here, Bong Sang Pil?

227
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,149
We've never talked one-on-one
like this before, have we?

228
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:00,720
Are you here to persuade me
to hire you as my attorney or what?

229
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,049
I have no interest
in representing you.

230
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,559
Then why are you here?

231
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,190
What about you?

232
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:09,629
Why did you agree to meet with me?

233
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:15,429
Say whatever you have to say
and get lost.

234
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:19,269
I want to make a deal with you.

235
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:20,570
"A deal"?

236
00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:23,139
You and me?

237
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,009
I have nothing to say to you.

238
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,350
I know that you've managing Cha
Moon Sook's borrowed name accounts.

239
00:13:31,549 --> 00:13:33,149
You're her safe-keeper.

240
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,220
I'm not sure where you heard
such a groundless rumor,

241
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,090
but I don't have anything
to do with that.

242
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,429
That's too bad.

243
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,629
It could've been
the last string of hope...

244
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:49,929
that could get you
out of this swamp.

245
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:53,669
Do you think that...

246
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:58,110
there's a lawyer in Kiseong,
other than me, who understands...

247
00:13:58,179 --> 00:13:59,279
your situation?

248
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,980
Cha Moon Sook is behind all of this.

249
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,480
You must've figured out that much
by now.

250
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,490
Don't you dare try
to damage her reputation.

251
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:14,389
She'd never do such a thing.

252
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,460
All right.
Do whatever you want, then.

253
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:24,870
Go ahead and keep holding on
to that rotten rope.

254
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,039
Oh, right.

255
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:33,279
Take some time and ponder
on what happened to An Oh Ju,

256
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:35,580
whom everyone thought
was invincible.

257
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:00,899
Boss, let's go.
I managed to book a room at a motel.

258
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:03,340
It's in the outskirts of the city,
so it should be safe.

259
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:11,179
Noh Hyun Joo
was the only card we could use...

260
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:14,120
to put Bong Sang Pil
and Cha Moon Sook...

261
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,990
behind bars.

262
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,759
What can we do?
We already lost that card.

263
00:15:20,659 --> 00:15:22,659
Just forget about it now, Boss.

264
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:26,830
What did you say?

265
00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:31,840
You sneaky bat. Could you forget
about it if you were in my position?

266
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:38,639
People talk
about power and politics,

267
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,750
but nothing is more honest
than these guys.

268
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:45,980
Boss.

269
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,990
Since we have these,

270
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,690
there are many countries
where we can live...

271
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:55,559
a luxurious, comfortable life.

272
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,860
Shall I look into our options
for stowing away?

273
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,970
You traitor.

274
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:05,440
Are you suggesting...

275
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,909
that I live as a fugitive
for the rest of my life?

276
00:16:09,809 --> 00:16:12,080
This can't bring me down.

277
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,279
Had that been the case, I would've
been beaten up to death a long ago.

278
00:16:17,549 --> 00:16:20,679
Then...
What are you going to do, then?

279
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:26,419
Well, I have to make everything
go back the way it used to be.

280
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,399
Go and pick up a can of soda
and a pack of cigarettes for me.

281
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,570
Got it, Boss.

282
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:42,509
Today, the disciplinary committee
decided to dismiss...

283
00:16:42,509 --> 00:16:46,039
Mayor of Kiseong, An Oh Ju,
from his post...

284
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:48,649
due to his misconduct
that disgraced the city.

285
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:53,580
As of today, An Oh Ju
is no longer the mayor of the city.

286
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,789
In the past 3 months,
the city of Kiseong...

287
00:16:56,789 --> 00:16:58,990
lost 2 mayors. One was murdered,

288
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,889
and the other one was ousted
as he's suspected of a crime.

289
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,389
Hello.

290
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,299
Attorney Ha, long time no see.

291
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:08,569
I heard that you've been
staying in Kiseong.

292
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,769
That's right. I took on...

293
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,339
an important trial.

294
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:17,640
Judge Cha.

295
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:30,319
You killed my mom, didn't you?

296
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,619
You completely destroyed my family.

297
00:17:34,859 --> 00:17:38,099
It looks like you've forgotten
about all the help you got from me.

298
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,230
Help?

299
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,329
Shut your mouth, you hypocrite.

300
00:17:41,329 --> 00:17:43,900
- Jae I.
- Don't even call my name.

301
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,769
I'll take you down
with everything I have.

302
00:17:54,309 --> 00:17:55,480
What's the matter with her?

303
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:09,160
Boss, is this...

304
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:13,599
The only thing that will
tie Bong Sang Pil down...

305
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:17,000
is right there.

306
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,240
Ha Jae I.

307
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:22,710
She's my final card.

308
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,309
If it goes wrong, it's really over.

309
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,309
Whether I live for a day...

310
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,220
or for a minute or a second,

311
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,680
I'd rather be true to myself.

312
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,789
I will live life in a way
that befits An Oh Ju.

313
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,720
What?

314
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,930
- Is that true?
- Yes.

315
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,000
My mom is alive.

316
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,299
That's such a relief.

317
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:55,839
Did Bong Sang Pil plan all that too?

318
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,339
That's why I ask that...

319
00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:03,210
you trust us and give us some time.

320
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:06,720
There's something
Attorney Bong and I must do.

321
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:10,349
You want me to pretend
I don't know for now?

322
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,619
That your mom's alive?

323
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:15,559
Yes, Detective Gong.

324
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:20,630
Dear prisoners and prison guards.

325
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,700
I wish you have another great day.

326
00:19:24,869 --> 00:19:28,970
How have you been, Bong Sang Pil?

327
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:30,569
An Oh Ju.

328
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:32,910
You sound great.

329
00:19:33,309 --> 00:19:35,210
Being a fugitive suits you.

330
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:37,980
Enough about that.
Have a look at this.

331
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:47,990
Isn't this the woman you miss
however much you look at her?

332
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,759
What are you up to?

333
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:54,500
Considering all that trouble
you're causing,

334
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,470
I just had to take a look at
your surroundings.

335
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:04,069
You dirty scum.

336
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,740
You turned me into this.

337
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:11,079
Did you just call me a scum?

338
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:18,319
Putting me back to where I was,
is another thing on your to-do list.

339
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:20,890
Understand?

340
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:37,670
Attorney Bong.

341
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:41,950
Jae I. Is everything okay?

342
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,009
What? Yes.

343
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,380
I'm with Detective Gong.

344
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:47,950
Are you?

345
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:50,690
Is Mr. Tae there?

346
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:54,160
Mr. Tae? Yes. Why?

347
00:20:55,529 --> 00:20:58,930
It's nothing.
I'll see you back at the office.

348
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,470
Let's go.

349
00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:15,450
What's going on, Mom?

350
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,319
Yeon Hee.

351
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,190
Are you here as my daughter?

352
00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:25,619
Yes. Talk to me.

353
00:21:26,859 --> 00:21:30,930
I need you to talk to
Judge Cha in person.

354
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:33,230
Judge Cha Moon Sook?

355
00:21:38,069 --> 00:21:41,640
Go and pass her my message.

356
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,920
Welcome, Prosecutor Kang.

357
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:57,150
Help my mom.

358
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:00,759
Yes, I heard what happened to her.

359
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:04,829
She spent her whole life
serving you...

360
00:22:04,829 --> 00:22:06,230
at your side.

361
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,799
- You know that.
- Yes.

362
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:10,930
It's such a pity.

363
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:13,440
Why did she do such a thing?

364
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,039
I just don't understand
why she did what she did.

365
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:22,650
I need you to pull some strings.

366
00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:26,319
There's nothing I can do right now.

367
00:22:29,619 --> 00:22:31,519
I visited her today.

368
00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:36,329
There's a Cha Byung Ho
Foundation sponsor ledger.

369
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,630
She said she needs to
pass it to you.

370
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:49,140
Since your mother...

371
00:22:50,109 --> 00:22:52,240
is cornered,

372
00:22:53,009 --> 00:22:56,950
she's threatening me
in such a sweet way.

373
00:22:58,579 --> 00:22:59,779
How dare she?

374
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,519
Your mother provided...

375
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:08,230
a bad choice and a worse choice.

376
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:13,329
You need to persuade your mother.

377
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,299
Being a good prosecutor...

378
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:18,869
means surviving the pain of
cutting out your own flesh.

379
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,539
Ma'am.

380
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:24,170
If you want an answer,
tell her this.

381
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,450
She must admit to her crime
and pay the price.

382
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:46,930
It'll be the biggest flaw
in your elaborate plan.

383
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:50,569
You not anticipating
our relationship.

384
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:09,549
Judge Cha.

385
00:24:10,289 --> 00:24:12,990
I'm so sorry to make you come here.

386
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:15,759
Judge Cha.

387
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,630
We must find the thug and soon.

388
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,259
If you let him roam,

389
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,099
he could cause you trouble.

390
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,769
I answered that already.

391
00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:29,339
Judge Cha.

392
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:32,640
You need to clear my name.

393
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:35,779
I did everything for you.

394
00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:37,349
I cleaned up for you.

395
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:40,720
Yes. It's just as you said.

396
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,519
You did it all. What did I do?

397
00:24:45,259 --> 00:24:46,259
Pardon?

398
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,359
Aren't you afraid of me?

399
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:51,160
I know everything you did.

400
00:24:56,069 --> 00:24:58,869
My father's foundation's ledger.

401
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,769
What do you think
you can do with that?

402
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,940
It will only add to your charges.

403
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:11,009
Judge Cha.

404
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:19,589
Trust Go In Du for now.

405
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,730
That's your best bet.

406
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:28,029
Judge Cha. Judge Cha!

407
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,150
Kwang Soo.

408
00:25:46,349 --> 00:25:49,250
I think Scorpion was attacked.

409
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,019
What? Attacked?

410
00:25:51,019 --> 00:25:52,289
I think word got out.

411
00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:54,220
Okay. I'll be right there.

412
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,930
- Welcome.
- Hi.

413
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:06,440
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

414
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:09,670
You're cold as ice
as an attorney in court,

415
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:12,440
but when you must fight,
you turn into fire.

416
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,339
I'm not afraid if I'm with you.

417
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:16,349
Don't like me too much.

418
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,650
- I'm spoken for.
- Too bad.

419
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:21,750
You stand out even though
we're holding weapons.

420
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,619
Was that a compliment or a diss?

421
00:26:23,619 --> 00:26:26,690
Listen up.
He's the best of the bunch.

422
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:29,559
I know that.
His every movement is so smooth.

423
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:34,630
All those compliments make me think
you want me to do all the fighting.

424
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,099
You'd better take your share, okay?

425
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,230
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

426
00:26:38,869 --> 00:26:40,839
- Let's go inside.
- Yes, sir!

427
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,109
Boss! Boss!

428
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:52,579
Power should be flaunted
when you're at the top.

429
00:26:52,579 --> 00:26:55,490
That is true responsibility.

430
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,819
Dae Woong might have
gotten me where I am,

431
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:02,329
but that's not good enough for me.

432
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,930
- You scum.
- Son of a witch.

433
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:11,269
I used to serve you.

434
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,240
Let's consider this your will.

435
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:20,680
Don't you think he's too young
to leave a will already?

436
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,380
Kwon Man Bae!

437
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,549
Darn it.

438
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:25,579
Bong Sang Pil, that fool.

439
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:31,690
- Come at me, you jerk!
- How dare you?

440
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,230
Come on.

441
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:56,049
- Boss!
- Watch it. What do you want?

442
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:37,450
Get down on your knees.

443
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:39,089
On your knees!

444
00:28:39,089 --> 00:28:41,460
- Keep looking down!
- Darn!

445
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:43,529
Kwon Man Bae,

446
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:47,299
why did you betray Boss?

447
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,700
Sang Pil,

448
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:52,369
where are your manners?

449
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,069
You betrayed my uncle...

450
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:57,839
and the rest of your gang.

451
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:00,839
Respecting you as a senior
is a waste of my breath.

452
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:03,079
I hate that tongue of yours.

453
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:06,049
It's been that way
ever since you passed the Bar.

454
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:13,089
I studied my butt off...

455
00:29:13,089 --> 00:29:15,329
so that I could fight with the law.

456
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:20,200
People like you though make me
deviate from my path...

457
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,700
which is super annoying.

458
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:27,140
We handle traitors in our own way.

459
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:35,039
Sure.

460
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,089
Kwang Soo.

461
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,160
Let go!

462
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:56,670
Man Bae,

463
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,740
the choice is yours.

464
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:03,470
Will you let Scorpion
handle this his way...

465
00:30:04,509 --> 00:30:06,539
or face me in the eyes of the law?

466
00:30:09,509 --> 00:30:12,279
You know very well
those two options have...

467
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,579
very different outcomes.

468
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,930
May I handle him then?

469
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,400
Sure.

470
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,339
Who am I to go against your will?

471
00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:35,710
Thank you, Scorpion.

472
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:38,579
This is ridiculous.

473
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:40,380
I mean, your arm...

474
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,380
Sang Pil.

475
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,950
What's going on? Are you hurt?

476
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:44,950
Well...

477
00:30:45,849 --> 00:30:47,819
Scorpion was in danger.

478
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,450
I had to help.

479
00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:54,289
Sang Pil,

480
00:30:55,089 --> 00:30:58,259
do you know what I think
when I see you this way?

481
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:01,130
Are you talking about
the fighting and the injuries?

482
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,430
Lawless.

483
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,539
It makes me realize
how hard it is for people like us...

484
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:08,269
to fight with the law...

485
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,710
against those with money and power.

486
00:31:11,809 --> 00:31:13,440
Still, we're lucky.

487
00:31:14,009 --> 00:31:15,609
At least we're lawyers.

488
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:20,279
That's why we have
to put on a good fight.

489
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,890
You're right.

490
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:27,859
It only seems like a flesh wound.

491
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:29,730
Unbelievable!

492
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:31,789
- What was that for?
- Tell me.

493
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,200
Did you win?

494
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,299
What do you think?

495
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:39,839
You went there with your gloves on,

496
00:31:40,269 --> 00:31:41,440
so it's obvious.

497
00:31:42,569 --> 00:31:44,109
Did you just approve of me?

498
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,410
It's not a bad feeling.

499
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,220
Here's your coffee.

500
00:31:58,859 --> 00:32:00,819
Thanks, Jae I.

501
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:07,630
I like how it's not that sweet.

502
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:12,700
That reminds me.
Did you look into Judge Hong?

503
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,099
Cha Moon Sook called him to Kiseong.

504
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:18,240
He's the messenger between
her and the party leader.

505
00:32:21,579 --> 00:32:22,980
We'll get rid of Judge Hong...

506
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:26,049
and have Judge Cha
preside the trial.

507
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,220
At Nam Soon Ja's trial?

508
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,289
Yes.

509
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:32,660
I'm going to take
Cha Moon Sook down...

510
00:32:33,859 --> 00:32:35,460
when she's in her robe.

511
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:39,630
You're going to give her an ending
that perfectly suits her.

512
00:32:39,859 --> 00:32:40,859
Exactly.

513
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:47,099
All right. I'll look into
Judge Hong a little more.

514
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:50,569
The money will lead us
to something useful.

515
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,410
I knew I could count on you.

516
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:54,079
Here.

517
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:55,410
- Let's do this.
- Let's do this.

518
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,220
You did it all.

519
00:33:08,789 --> 00:33:10,190
What did I do?

520
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,730
Do you think that...

521
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,900
there's a lawyer in Kiseong,
other than me, who understands...

522
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,500
your situation?

523
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,740
I won't go down like this.

524
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,049
He's the one I need.

525
00:33:33,349 --> 00:33:34,950
Guard. Guard!

526
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,119
- Guard.
- Hey!

527
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:39,089
- That hurts!
- I want to make a phone call.

528
00:33:39,089 --> 00:33:40,859
- Go back to sleep.
- Shut up.

529
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:44,089
Let me call
Prosecutor Kang Yeon Hee!

530
00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:45,329
It's urgent.

531
00:33:45,329 --> 00:33:47,430
(Lawless Law Firm)

532
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:49,430
(Lawless Law Firm)

533
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:58,269
Prosecutor Kang,
what brings you by so early?

534
00:33:58,269 --> 00:33:59,779
Didn't you know...

535
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:01,579
that I'd be stopping by?

536
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:04,049
You're here to relay
your mom's answer.

537
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:06,619
She agreed to accept...

538
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,420
your offer.

539
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:11,219
So,

540
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,320
what do you have with you?

541
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,690
It's the ledger...

542
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,230
of Cha Byung Ho Foundation
my mother kept.

543
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:28,269
How can I trust that you won't...

544
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:30,139
use this against her?

545
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:32,610
Don't trust me if you don't want to,

546
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:34,010
Prosecutor Kang.

547
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,750
Know this though.

548
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,849
She'll get the sentence
she deserves.

549
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,650
Not more and not less.

550
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,190
Is that so?

551
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:51,130
My mom had two choices.
A bad one and a worse one.

552
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,400
I guess she chose the former.

553
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,440
Yeon Hee.

554
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:10,510
What was she doing here?

555
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:12,619
Did her mom give you an answer?

556
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,280
Yes.

557
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:16,420
She gave me the ledger.

558
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,320
The ledger?

559
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:20,590
Boss.

560
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,860
- Hi.
- Hi, guys.

561
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:26,559
Nam Soon Ja took the bait.

562
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:28,929
- The bait?
- Yes, we got her!

563
00:35:29,769 --> 00:35:32,539
This is the ledger for
the Cha Byung Ho Foundation.

564
00:35:32,539 --> 00:35:36,309
It's a list full of
corrupt money transaction.

565
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:38,409
- I didn't know you knew that.
- Of course I do.

566
00:35:38,409 --> 00:35:40,510
Cha Moon Sook's name isn't in here.

567
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:43,250
Of course
we can't find traces of her.

568
00:35:43,579 --> 00:35:46,550
There's one thing
we can be sure of though.

569
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:49,119
I think I know what is.

570
00:35:50,789 --> 00:35:54,159
She's telling us that she has proof
of Cha Moon Sook's corruption.

571
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:56,329
It's a signal.

572
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,090
Correct.

573
00:35:58,929 --> 00:36:03,030
That's why we need to do
make a proper deal with her.

574
00:36:04,469 --> 00:36:08,340
Did you authorize the protection
around my residence?

575
00:36:09,269 --> 00:36:11,769
Between the Thai acupressurist...

576
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,940
and you being a candidate
for Chief Justice,

577
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:17,579
I was too worried about you
to do nothing.

578
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,420
Thank you, Mr. Jang.

579
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,920
An Oh Ju is still on the run...

580
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,920
which is a problem.

581
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:30,090
You never know what a thug
with nothing to lose will do.

582
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,940
Keep this at your house
for protection.

583
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,269
I'll show you how to use it.

584
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,780
(Nam Soon Ja)

585
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:57,690
All right. We're done.

586
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,219
Did you get my message?

587
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:03,929
Starting today,
I'm officially your lawyer.

588
00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:07,530
Do you know what
my signature means?

589
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:08,530
Of course.

590
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:12,269
You, Cha Moon Sook's
confidante of 30 years,

591
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:15,500
is finally cutting
all ties with her.

592
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:17,769
That's exactly right.

593
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,039
Now,

594
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:22,679
tell me what you can do for me.

595
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:27,519
I won't let you be punished
for what you haven't done.

596
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:33,889
Everything you did was
ordered by Cha Moon Sook anyway.

597
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:36,230
You're right!

598
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:39,230
I didn't do any of it.
I was only following orders!

599
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:41,659
Who am I to make those decisions?

600
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:45,369
I'm nothing but
a silly little housewife.

601
00:37:50,139 --> 00:37:52,269
She signed it faster
than I expected her to.

602
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:55,380
She took out an insurance plan
by signing me on.

603
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:59,019
Can we trust her until the very end?

604
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,320
All right, let's go.
Now that we have the case,

605
00:38:05,659 --> 00:38:07,960
we should go meet
with our dear enemy.

606
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,929
- Prosecutor Cheon Seung Beom?
- Yes.

607
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:14,030
I've actually been wanting
to ask you this.

608
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:17,230
How do you and Prosecutor Cheon
know each other?

609
00:38:18,269 --> 00:38:19,400
How do we know each other?

610
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,570
I'm sorry, Boss.

611
00:38:29,949 --> 00:38:33,820
You beat up seven guys to a pulp,
and they're all hospitalized now?

612
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,650
Well, they attacked
my friend here first.

613
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:39,389
Sir.

614
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:42,329
It's all my fault.
Sang Pil didn't do anything wrong.

615
00:38:42,429 --> 00:38:43,590
Be quiet, okay?

616
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:44,659
I'm sorry, Boss.

617
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:48,900
You punks are still wet
behind the ears.

618
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:52,199
"Boss"? Don't even.

619
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,840
You guys have obviously watched
too many gangster movies.

620
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:56,110
Then what?

621
00:38:56,110 --> 00:39:00,579
Are you saying it's okay for punks
like us to get beaten to death?

622
00:39:00,579 --> 00:39:01,840
Sang Pil.

623
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,849
I told you those jerks
almost killed him.

624
00:39:03,849 --> 00:39:05,510
What would've happened
if I hadn't shown up?

625
00:39:06,019 --> 00:39:08,550
Isn't this considered self-defense?
Self-defense.

626
00:39:09,989 --> 00:39:11,289
Self-defense?

627
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:14,059
It doesn't apply to every situation.

628
00:39:16,289 --> 00:39:17,530
Eyes down.

629
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:23,730
Hey.

630
00:39:24,769 --> 00:39:27,369
I heard you're number two
in Dae Woong Gang now.

631
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,909
Why did you hit him?

632
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:38,380
Sir, isn't this considered coercion?

633
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:47,460
You seem to be very interested in
the law even though you're a thug.

634
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:50,929
He's studying to become a lawyer.

635
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:54,300
What? A lawyer?

636
00:39:57,429 --> 00:40:00,139
Hey, you didn't know that there was
a security camera there, did you?

637
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:04,469
Even though you did it alone,
it's still considered assault.

638
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:07,340
You even used a baseball bat.

639
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:10,849
So it's assault with a weapon.

640
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:16,190
I'll make sure to put the guys
at the hospital behind bars as well.

641
00:40:16,949 --> 00:40:18,420
I don't want you to feel victimized.

642
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,659
Okay, that sounds fair.

643
00:40:23,329 --> 00:40:24,530
Those of you in Dae Woong Gang,

644
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:27,099
you'd better watch out.

645
00:40:27,099 --> 00:40:29,969
Thugs don't scare me at all.
Nothing can stop me.

646
00:40:30,429 --> 00:40:33,239
Prosecutor Cheon
hasn't changed one bit.

647
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,400
So that's how you two met.

648
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:39,710
Now that he's in Kiseong,
we must accomplish our goal.

649
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,210
Come in.

650
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:48,219
Hello, sir.

651
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:49,719
Bong Sang Pil.

652
00:40:51,389 --> 00:40:52,920
What brings you here today?

653
00:40:53,789 --> 00:40:56,630
I, Bong Sang Pil, am
Ms. Nam Soon Ja's attorney...

654
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:58,230
as of today.

655
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,400
Goodness.

656
00:41:02,969 --> 00:41:03,969
What?

657
00:41:03,969 --> 00:41:07,170
Many surprises are waiting for you,
sir.

658
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:09,210
You two.

659
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:11,670
Who are you, really?

660
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,409
As you know,

661
00:41:13,409 --> 00:41:15,980
we're lawyers at Lawless Law Firm.

662
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:19,420
You see,

663
00:41:20,349 --> 00:41:23,349
if you're using me to get
your revenge, I won't let it slide.

664
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:26,619
From what I know, your goal is
realizing a just society.

665
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:28,719
Am I wrong?

666
00:41:29,429 --> 00:41:33,199
I don't think Sang Pil wants to use
anyone to get his revenge.

667
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:35,760
I've already confirmed it.

668
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:39,539
I'm relieved to hear that.

669
00:41:41,269 --> 00:41:44,869
If you're here to fish for
information, I have nothing to say.

670
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:48,079
I don't think he came
all the way here...

671
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,380
to show his card to his enemy
either.

672
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:52,519
We'll be meeting
in the courtroom soon.

673
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,380
I just wanted to tell you
not to be nervous.

674
00:41:56,449 --> 00:41:57,489
Hey.

675
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:00,719
We know each other, but the trial
has nothing to do with that.

676
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:04,659
Let's be fair and square
and uncover the truth together.

677
00:42:05,329 --> 00:42:08,599
We always go straight,
whereas he always stays neutral.

678
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:10,130
I like that.

679
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,730
That's why I trust him,

680
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:14,000
but I personally
hated him at your trial.

681
00:42:14,769 --> 00:42:16,110
How do you think I felt?

682
00:42:16,739 --> 00:42:18,010
Whenever I think about that day...

683
00:42:18,309 --> 00:42:19,340
Hey, Geum Ja.

684
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,780
Okay. I'll be there shortly.

685
00:42:23,449 --> 00:42:24,579
Was that Geum Ja?

686
00:42:24,579 --> 00:42:26,519
She's tailing Judge Hong
at the moment.

687
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:27,619
She's tailing him?

688
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:30,320
It's about time I got used to the
Lawless Law Firm style, you know.

689
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,250
Nice one, Attorney Ha.

690
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:35,320
It seems that Bong Sang Pil...

691
00:42:36,059 --> 00:42:38,059
is becoming
more like a real lawyer now.

692
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:41,860
You rarely open up like this, sir.

693
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:49,139
I thought that he was holding
nothing but grudges in his heart.

694
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:50,869
Grudges...

695
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:53,280
Both Bong Sang Pil and Ha Jae I...

696
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,849
went through tragedies because of
what happened 18 years ago.

697
00:42:58,610 --> 00:42:59,719
Both of them?

698
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:07,920
Please have a look.

699
00:43:10,489 --> 00:43:12,360
(Missing Person)

700
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:18,900
Bong Sang Pil's mother died
on the day that Ha Jae I's mother...

701
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,099
went missing.

702
00:43:20,369 --> 00:43:21,369
Yes.

703
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:25,170
What's up?

704
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,320
Honey.

705
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,360
My gosh.

706
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:50,000
Are you really going to be
like this? How can you kick me out?

707
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,630
Oh, my goodness. What is going on?

708
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,670
Is that apartment yours?

709
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,570
Do you own it?

710
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:57,469
You promised me that you'd
put it under my name.

711
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:01,579
Hey, that was a while back.
The situation is different now.

712
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:05,380
Things change all the time,
and so do our feelings.

713
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,179
Do you think it's unfair?

714
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:10,989
Then why didn't you make me
sign something back then?

715
00:44:13,389 --> 00:44:14,389
Gosh, you little...

716
00:44:14,489 --> 00:44:15,519
Goodness!

717
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,260
I guess I've been too nice to you.

718
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,599
How dare you lay a finger
on a judge?

719
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:24,630
That woman...

720
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:27,500
is a potential threat to Judge Hong,

721
00:44:27,739 --> 00:44:29,739
but she'd be a well of information
for us.

722
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,610
I think she's the perfect person
to help us.

723
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:33,610
(Kim Nu Ri, Kim Na Hyun,
Lee Ju Hyun)

724
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:37,050
He got divorced
less than a year ago,

725
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:41,050
and he's gone through
3 girlfriends in the past 6 months.

726
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:42,179
My, that's impressive.

727
00:44:42,449 --> 00:44:43,449
Indeed.

728
00:44:44,889 --> 00:44:46,789
They say that all men
are fickle-minded.

729
00:44:47,289 --> 00:44:50,559
Jae I, let's never change.

730
00:44:50,929 --> 00:44:51,989
Friendship forever!

731
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:53,860
Friendship forever.

732
00:44:53,929 --> 00:44:56,099
Kwang Soo, we should do it too.
Friendship forever.

733
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:57,300
That's it.

734
00:45:07,409 --> 00:45:08,409
Hello.

735
00:45:10,449 --> 00:45:11,510
(Lawless Law Firm, Ha Jae I)

736
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,579
I'll make sure
you're monetarily compensated...

737
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:17,150
for all the tears you've shed
because of Judge Hong.

738
00:45:17,489 --> 00:45:19,320
Sorry? I beg your pardon?

739
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,889
A jerk like him
does not deserve to be forgiven.

740
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:25,329
Make him give you a fat chunk of
cash as compensation so that...

741
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,000
he deeply regrets what he did.

742
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:29,300
Ma'am.

743
00:45:29,469 --> 00:45:32,199
This lady here is an amazing lawyer.

744
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,039
Aren't you furious?

745
00:45:34,269 --> 00:45:36,340
Jerks who have no manners...

746
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:38,469
should be taken to court so that
they can learn their lessons.

747
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:41,179
She'll get you
a huge compensation package.

748
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:43,880
Thank you.

749
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:49,019
You said I can give you this
instead of paying you, right?

750
00:45:49,019 --> 00:45:50,489
Yes, I'll go over it.

751
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:54,360
(Registration Certificate,
Owner Hong Woo Seok)

752
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:57,460
So Judge Hong took a bribe...

753
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:00,000
and made an unfair ruling.

754
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,030
(Name: Hong Woo Seok)

755
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:04,969
- Yes.
- This has all the details. Thanks.

756
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:08,139
I'll make sure you win the lawsuit.

757
00:46:08,369 --> 00:46:09,610
A huge compensation package!

758
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:11,369
You can do it!

759
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:43,909
Mayor An, Mayor An.

760
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,809
Oh Ju. I'm so sorry.

761
00:46:50,409 --> 00:46:51,409
Oh Ju.

762
00:46:56,989 --> 00:46:58,590
Let's talk it out. Talk.

763
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:02,519
So, Go In Du.

764
00:47:02,929 --> 00:47:05,989
Hey. Read this.

765
00:47:06,059 --> 00:47:07,199
What does it say?

766
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,269
Read it!

767
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:15,639
Mayor of Kiseong, An Oh Ju.

768
00:47:15,639 --> 00:47:17,840
Yes, that's correct.

769
00:47:19,539 --> 00:47:23,610
Give Cha Moon Sook this message.

770
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,480
Next time, it's her turn.

771
00:47:27,449 --> 00:47:28,579
Do you get it?

772
00:47:31,019 --> 00:47:32,019
Gwan Dong.

773
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:41,530
Say cheese.

774
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:44,199
Kimchi.

775
00:47:45,469 --> 00:47:48,199
That'll do. Goodbye.

776
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:56,750
Judge,
the date for your hearing is set.

777
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,510
The representative
of our party has high hopes.

778
00:48:00,579 --> 00:48:03,119
I cleared out everyone around me.

779
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:04,889
Everyone but one.

780
00:48:06,389 --> 00:48:08,719
After Nam Soon Ja's trial,

781
00:48:09,289 --> 00:48:11,130
I will sort that out too.

782
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:17,769
Then I must
wrap this trial up nicely.

783
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:20,000
Just the way you like it.

784
00:48:20,099 --> 00:48:22,739
Don't feel too much pressure.

785
00:48:22,739 --> 00:48:25,070
Do as you always do.
Abide by the law.

786
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:26,170
Okay.

787
00:48:27,539 --> 00:48:30,110
But Judge Cha.

788
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:34,550
Nam Soon Ja hired
a different attorney.

789
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,219
She changed attorneys?

790
00:48:36,889 --> 00:48:38,190
Why are you telling me now?

791
00:48:44,429 --> 00:48:45,989
Is it Bong Sang Pil?

792
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:49,059
Yes.

793
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:00,280
Judge Cha.

794
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,480
If you betray me,
this is what happens.

795
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,070
(Daeho Stationary)

796
00:49:46,019 --> 00:49:47,760
(Lawless Law Firm)

797
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,579
Cha Moon Sook.

798
00:50:16,349 --> 00:50:19,989
I didn't think you'd come here
on your own accord.

799
00:50:29,329 --> 00:50:31,699
If you're right, Nam Soon Ja...

800
00:50:31,699 --> 00:50:34,099
ordered the murder
of Ha Jae I's mom.

801
00:50:35,539 --> 00:50:37,869
But you're going to defend her?

802
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:39,809
I don't get it.

803
00:50:40,309 --> 00:50:43,809
Just like how we can
never understand you,

804
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:49,019
you will never understand
our pain even if you're born again.

805
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:52,949
Jae I's putting up with it all,

806
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:56,190
despite the sheer agony.
Do you get that?

807
00:50:56,889 --> 00:51:00,659
Are you saying that
she accepted your decision?

808
00:51:00,929 --> 00:51:04,030
I told you before that
this isn't just a defense.

809
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:06,400
It's judgement.

810
00:51:08,969 --> 00:51:11,110
I'm the judge of Kiseong.

811
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:15,440
Don't you get that you're
throwing eggs at a boulder?

812
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:17,650
Is that so?

813
00:51:20,219 --> 00:51:23,079
Fine. Keep watching.

814
00:51:24,219 --> 00:51:27,760
That boulder will split open soon.

815
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:28,760
Will it?

816
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,860
You will end up losing both to me...

817
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:34,630
and to the law.

818
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:55,780
(1st hearing)

819
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:58,449
(Detainment and instigation
of murder of Thai acupressurist)

820
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:04,429
- Look. Good luck.
- Good luck.

821
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:15,340
Mom, are you okay?

822
00:52:24,849 --> 00:52:26,519
The judge is here.

823
00:52:26,949 --> 00:52:28,150
All rise.

824
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,289
Be seated.

825
00:52:46,369 --> 00:52:47,969
I'll begin the trial
on detainment...

826
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:50,610
and instigation of murder
of the Thai acupressurist.

827
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:53,440
Prosecution, opening argument.

828
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:58,610
I'd like to say something
before official procedures begin.

829
00:52:59,349 --> 00:53:00,349
What's that?

830
00:53:00,349 --> 00:53:03,019
I request a change of judge.

831
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:07,960
I wish to avoid this judge.

832
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:11,460
What are you doing?

833
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:13,800
Attorney Bong.

834
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,130
Didn't you request for...

835
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,369
a change of judge once before?

836
00:53:18,769 --> 00:53:19,869
Yes, I did.

837
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:21,599
Just like back then,

838
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:24,739
I have reason to believe you will...

839
00:53:24,739 --> 00:53:26,269
give us an unfair sentence.

840
00:53:26,739 --> 00:53:29,440
If we just weren't in court...

841
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:32,849
Let's hear why.

842
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:34,619
I'll hear you out,

843
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:37,449
and if your reason
isn't good enough...

844
00:53:39,219 --> 00:53:40,360
I'll acknowledge what you said...

845
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:43,260
if you put your attorney title
on the line.

846
00:53:43,829 --> 00:53:48,199
Getting my client a fair trial...

847
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:51,000
is my duty as an attorney.

848
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,230
Will you put your title on the line
or not?

849
00:54:01,909 --> 00:54:04,710
Yes. I'll put my title on the line.

850
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,050
If I can't prove it,

851
00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:14,489
as soon as this trial is over,
I will close my firm.

852
00:54:17,829 --> 00:54:18,960
(Judge Cha Moon Sook)

853
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,010
Judge Cha.

854
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:33,980
What is it?

855
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,510
Well...

856
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:39,809
Attorney Bong requested
a change of judge.

857
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:43,420
Did he?

858
00:54:47,289 --> 00:54:48,619
Okay, you can go.

859
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:50,429
Okay.

860
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:08,409
Attorney Bong.

861
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:10,880
Do you know you are insulting...

862
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,780
our judiciary system
with your actions?

863
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:13,980
I do.

864
00:55:14,449 --> 00:55:16,949
I have cause for reasonable doubt.

865
00:55:18,019 --> 00:55:19,590
May I prove it?

866
00:55:21,059 --> 00:55:25,159
This trail has
nothing to do with me.

867
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:28,130
However, as a judge,

868
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:30,769
to preserve my honor,

869
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,869
I will give you a shot.

870
00:55:34,699 --> 00:55:35,969
You should be grateful.

871
00:55:37,539 --> 00:55:39,769
Thank you, Your Honor.

872
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:44,480
Let's hear why you have
reasonable doubt.

873
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:01,530
Here.

874
00:56:02,329 --> 00:56:03,969
What you see here...

875
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:07,199
are photos of one of
the best villas in Kiseong.

876
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:11,110
The market price was
three million dollars.

877
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:14,610
My goodness.

878
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:16,710
The owner of this villa...

879
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:18,409
is you, am I right?

880
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:21,079
Is this it?

881
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,219
Is there a problem with a judge...

882
00:56:24,219 --> 00:56:26,489
purchasing a villa these days?

883
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:30,360
There's no problem
at all with a judge...

884
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,090
purchasing a villa these days.

885
00:56:33,159 --> 00:56:34,159
However,

886
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:37,869
what if you got the villa...

887
00:56:37,869 --> 00:56:40,170
worth 3 million dollars
for just 100,000 dollars?

888
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:41,170
What?

889
00:56:41,539 --> 00:56:42,900
Who said that?

890
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:46,309
What are you talking about?

891
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,909
It's obviously groundless.

892
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:53,550
This is the sale contract for the
villa worth three million dollars.

893
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:56,349
And it says 100,000 dollars instead.

894
00:56:57,219 --> 00:56:58,219
If you take a closer look,

895
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:00,690
you can find Judge Hong's
signature on it.

896
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:05,429
Is that right, Your Honor?

897
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:26,780
I think it's done. Come here.

898
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:31,019
Attorney Ha Jae I.

899
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:34,559
So you want to defend me?

900
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:40,400
I'd like to make a tempting offer.

901
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,030
Well...

902
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:47,940
Don't you need the evidence
to get rid of Cha Moon Sook?

903
00:57:48,639 --> 00:57:49,639
What?

904
00:57:50,969 --> 00:57:53,809
We need to talk, just the two of us.

905
00:57:54,139 --> 00:57:56,340
Okay? Now.

906
00:57:57,309 --> 00:57:58,679
If you don't come,

907
00:57:59,349 --> 00:58:01,179
I'll go to your father.

908
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,280
An Oh Ju.

909
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:03,989
An...

910
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:12,190
Recently, there was the ruling...

911
00:58:12,289 --> 00:58:14,329
about labor in jail.

912
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:17,469
500,000 dollars per night in jail.

913
00:58:18,099 --> 00:58:20,000
The penalty was reduced...

914
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,070
by 24.5 million dollars
after 49 days in jail.

915
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:26,409
The man who
got the special favor is...

916
00:58:26,409 --> 00:58:28,679
Chairman Kang Il Ho
of Kiseong Construction.

917
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:32,280
And the one who made the ruling
is Judge Hong Woo Seok...

918
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:34,320
who's sitting right over there.

919
00:58:35,219 --> 00:58:37,489
- Bong Sang Pil!
- Just be honest.

920
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,519
Didn't you cut a deal
for your ruling?

921
00:58:39,519 --> 00:58:42,760
Do you think you can make up
stories in court like that?

922
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:47,730
I feel bad for my client.

923
00:58:49,429 --> 00:58:51,730
Even though I'm a competent lawyer,

924
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:57,469
I can't afford to give you
a fancy villa like that.

925
00:58:58,369 --> 00:59:01,340
Regardless of my defense,

926
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:05,880
the ruling is highly likely to be
based on his personal feelings.

927
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:07,320
So...

928
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,219
I'd like to file a judicial recusal,

929
00:59:12,119 --> 00:59:13,860
Your Honor.

930
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:20,260
The prosecution shall reconsider...

931
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:23,460
the case that the defense counsel
just described.

932
00:59:23,829 --> 00:59:27,500
We will file a judicial recusal.

933
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:30,769
Okay!

934
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:42,619
Where's Attorney Ha?

935
00:59:42,619 --> 00:59:44,550
She got a call
and left during the trial.

936
00:59:47,789 --> 00:59:49,960
- Go find her.
- Okay.

937
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,159
Give me the phone.

938
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:55,130
Attorney Bong, do you think
Nam Soon Ja is innocent?

939
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:59,300
You'll come to know...

940
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:01,699
if you keep your eye
on the trial.

941
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:04,170
You filed a judicial recusal.

942
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:06,409
Do you have anything
to say to Kiseong District Court?

943
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:13,880
The Court must be fair
no matter what.

944
01:00:14,119 --> 01:00:17,119
In order to have justice
in Kiseong District Court...

945
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:19,090
and recover its reputation,

946
01:00:23,159 --> 01:00:27,460
I want the most righteous
judge in Kiseong...

947
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:29,800
to take the case.

948
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:33,199
Is there any judge you have in mind?

949
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,340
Where did you get the evidence
of Judge Hong's corruption?

950
01:00:37,239 --> 01:00:39,039
I'll tell you that later.

951
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:41,909
- Where did you get the document?
- Please answer the question.

952
01:00:41,909 --> 01:00:44,150
Is there any judge you have in mind?

953
01:00:46,849 --> 01:00:48,719
By the way, where's Attorney Ha?

954
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:49,719
I know.

955
01:00:50,789 --> 01:00:51,849
It's her.

956
01:00:52,449 --> 01:00:54,360
- I'll see you in the office.
- Okay.

957
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,559
- Good work.
- Thank you. Bye.

958
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:06,269
Jae I, where are you?

959
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:08,900
Where did you go during the trial?

960
01:01:09,139 --> 01:01:11,570
Hey, Bong Sang Pil.

961
01:01:12,469 --> 01:01:14,110
You look good on TV.

962
01:01:14,510 --> 01:01:15,510
Right?

963
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:19,849
Where's Jae I?

964
01:01:20,179 --> 01:01:23,079
I'm calling you to tell you that.

965
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,690
I warned you.

966
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:28,119
I won't care about the law
if you mess with her.

967
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:29,820
That's enough.

968
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:32,030
Just come over here.

969
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:52,780
An Oh Ju!

970
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:57,590
Come on out!
Come here, you crazy scumbag!

971
01:01:59,489 --> 01:02:00,820
Welcome.

972
01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:03,289
Bong Sang Pil.

973
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,530
Where did you hide Jae I?

974
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:12,630
Ha Jae I?

975
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,309
Do you want to know?

976
01:02:18,710 --> 01:02:19,710
Do you?

977
01:02:21,739 --> 01:02:23,079
Hey.

978
01:02:24,349 --> 01:02:27,050
If you have something to protect,

979
01:02:27,519 --> 01:02:31,949
I have my own thing to protect too,
you jerk.

980
01:02:34,619 --> 01:02:35,719
Hey, An Oh Ju.

981
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:38,730
You're already a broken container.

982
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,059
I don't have the power...

983
01:02:41,829 --> 01:02:43,030
to stick them together.

984
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:44,869
No one does.

985
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,699
Just admit it.

986
01:02:52,739 --> 01:02:55,039
My gosh.

987
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,280
Attorney Bong Sang Pil.

988
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,880
Do you care about Ha Jae I
that much?

989
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:04,820
Do you?

990
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:08,860
Isn't my neck that you want?

991
01:03:11,159 --> 01:03:13,130
I'm here...

992
01:03:13,730 --> 01:03:15,429
to give you the chance.

993
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:22,199
Look at you. What a wiry man.

994
01:03:22,969 --> 01:03:25,110
You want to save your girl.

995
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:28,610
I'll grant your wish then.

996
01:03:31,309 --> 01:03:34,849
You're no match for me, you idiot.

997
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:36,820
Kneel down.

998
01:03:38,989 --> 01:03:41,320
I said kneel down.

999
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:53,869
I'll take care of Ha Jae I.

1000
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:55,900
Don't worry about her.

1001
01:03:58,969 --> 01:04:00,210
I'll count to three.

1002
01:04:03,139 --> 01:04:04,150
One.

1003
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:06,710
Two.

1004
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:10,550
Goodbye.

1005
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,389
Bong Sang Pil.

1006
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,650
(Lawless Lawyer)

1007
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,679
Cha Moon Sook used Bong Sang Pil
to get rid of you.

1008
01:04:41,679 --> 01:04:45,090
Stand before the court
and prove Cha Moon Sook's guilt.

1009
01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:47,019
Let's do it An Oh Ju's way.

1010
01:04:49,659 --> 01:04:53,159
Either you or I will eventually die.

1011
01:04:53,530 --> 01:04:55,960
That's what I'm saying.

1012
01:04:57,699 --> 01:05:00,070
There's no turning back now.

1013
01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:05,670
Stop it.
