1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,139
(Lawless Lawyer)

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,150
(Lee Joon Gi)

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,980
(Seo Yea Ji)

4
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:17,859
(Lee Hye Young)

5
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,899
(Choi Min Su)

6
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:29,969
(Lawless Lawyer)

7
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,270
I'm more like a problem solver.

8
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,109
The best problem solver
who's a licensed lawyer.

9
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,009
It's not like
judges are always right!

10
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:45,820
I'm a lawyer.
Are you the owner of this place?

11
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,750
You fraudulent jerk!

12
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,090
It means I'll fight using the law.

13
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,630
I'll fight for my clients,
with the law as my weapon.

14
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,659
(Always push forward.)

15
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,259
Therefore,
I find the defendant not guilty.

16
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,500
Chairman An is no longer
a gangster like you.

17
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,799
He's a businessman,
a successful entrepreneur.

18
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,909
What is the client
being accused for?

19
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,069
Murder.

20
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:11,079
He's being accused of
killing Mayor Lee Young Soo.

21
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:14,349
Detective Wu Hyung Man,
let me make you a free man.

22
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,719
Can you call me Mom like
you did when you were a kid?

23
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:18,849
Mom.

24
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:22,450
Are you cut out for the job
of mayor of Kiseong?

25
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,390
- I'm truly honored!
- I see that you're out for blood.

26
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,189
Do whatever you want.

27
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,260
Who are you guys? Who are you...

28
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,799
Gosh, you worthless thugs...

29
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,269
I need to be compensated for this.
Get the money ready.

30
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:35,299
Anyway,

31
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:37,439
isn't he coming to get me?

32
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:41,540
Did you forfeit the trial
to come here?

33
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,969
I didn't give up on the trial.

34
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:46,180
Let me quote Mike Tyson.

35
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:49,379
"Everyone has a plan..."

36
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:53,890
"until they get punched
in the mouth."

37
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:56,189
- Are you all right?
- Is this for real?

38
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:57,459
Are you really Sang Pil?

39
00:01:57,459 --> 00:01:58,519
Sang Pil!

40
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,700
This fight will
become yours and mine.

41
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:38,229
I found it.

42
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,830
What would you like me to do
about the lawyer and her son?

43
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,099
Kill them both.

44
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,110
I don't trust the living.

45
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,169
Who are you?

46
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:21,610
I am Attorney Bong Sang Pil.

47
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,080
The trial begins now.

48
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,620
Judge Cha Moon Sook.

49
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:43,259
Arrest everyone involved
in the case immediately.

50
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,330
(Episode 3)

51
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,330
I've never been in such
a disorderly courtroom...

52
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,000
my entire life.

53
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,680
Attorney Bong Sang Pil, give
a full account of your being late.

54
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,449
On his way here, he helped me...

55
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:06,919
- in trouble...
- Not you, Ms. Ha.

56
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,490
I want Attorney Bong
to answer my question.

57
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,530
Yes, Your Honor.

58
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:19,329
Those who don't want me
to be on this trial...

59
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,269
Would you mind
if I got back to you later?

60
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,839
Your Honor,
the attorney is bleeding a lot.

61
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,310
Can he be excused to
get emergency treatment?

62
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,009
The court will be adjourned
momentarily.

63
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,920
It's done.

64
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,819
Fortunately, the wound isn't deep.

65
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:42,689
I see. Thank you.

66
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,660
There's so much blood on your shirt.

67
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:51,730
I knew you were overdoing it.

68
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,399
I haven't used my fist because
I wanted to win with the law,

69
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,939
so I'm not as good as I used to be.

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,569
I think being an action movie actor
suits you better than a lawyer.

71
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,009
It's a lawyer's job to show up...

72
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:06,139
and save his client
when there's any danger.

73
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,550
like an action hero.

74
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:11,480
By the way,
why did those thugs kidnap me?

75
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,620
I told you...

76
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,089
that you'd go through many things
if you work with me.

77
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:17,920
Watching that action movie today
was enough,

78
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,790
so I hope something like this
won't happen again.

79
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,529
What's that look?

80
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,970
Is there something else I don't know
about the trial?

81
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,839
I'll be...

82
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,910
arrested during the trial.

83
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:35,269
What? What...

84
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:37,079
"Arrested"?

85
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,579
The trial will resume.

86
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,180
Yes, we're coming.

87
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,790
I might not have a good lawyer,
but at least my judge is qualified.

88
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:53,019
If you defend me well, she'll
make a fair decision, so please...

89
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,290
- Do a good job, please.
- Presiding Judge Cha is entering.

90
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,829
- All rise.
- Do you really think so?

91
00:05:58,529 --> 00:06:01,300
- Don't you know Judge Cha?
- What do you mean?

92
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,870
Now, please be seated.

93
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,139
You don't know anything, do you?

94
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,209
We'll resume the trial now.

95
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,410
Your Honor.

96
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,279
There's something I'd like to
ask you before we resume the trial.

97
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:17,550
- What is it?
- We'd like a new judge.

98
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:23,959
You arrived 30 minutes late,

99
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:27,529
and that's the first thing you're
saying as soon as you arrive?

100
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:28,829
Yes, Your Honor.

101
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:31,660
We'd like to request a recusal.

102
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,930
Really?

103
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,800
First, I'd like to hear...

104
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:38,540
your reason.

105
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,970
If the complaint
isn't legitimate enough,

106
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,470
there will be consequences for you.

107
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,709
Please proceed.

108
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,220
One of the judges in front of me...

109
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,120
committed misconduct
that significantly disgraced...

110
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,259
the judiciary as a whole and court.

111
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:02,589
Who's the judge?

112
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,259
I prepared something.

113
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,129
The Golden City!

114
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,970
The Golden City.

115
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,379
Sir, I just found out that
Bong Sang Pil showed up in court.

116
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:20,779
Seok Gwan Dong, that idiot.

117
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:23,209
Tell him to come here now.

118
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,879
You pervert!

119
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,060
Many people complimented him
for taking...

120
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,959
public transit to commute to work.

121
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:37,199
Who knew he was doing it
to secretly record videos like this?

122
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:40,029
Isn't this utterly shocking?

123
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:41,170
Your Honor.

124
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,629
He's slandering
the entire justice department.

125
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,040
This has nothing to do
with the case.

126
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,970
He's treating the associate judge
like a defendant.

127
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,439
I guess you didn't know because
you're not in charge of it.

128
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:53,379
It's already all over
the police intranet.

129
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:56,250
And articles about it
will be published today.

130
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,480
Please go back to your seat.

131
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:06,089
One more thing.

132
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:10,029
I would also like to ask that you,
Presiding Judge Cha,

133
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:13,600
be recused for choosing an
assistant judge who acts this way.

134
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,769
No!

135
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:17,470
Your Honor, that can't happen.
Absolutely not!

136
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,500
Hye Rim, your poor dad...

137
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:26,879
Do you want to drag me
out of the judge's bench?

138
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,910
Your Honor, you either chose the
associate judge,

139
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,550
fully knowing that he doesn't
qualify due to his misconduct,

140
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:34,120
or just found out about it,
which is also wrong.

141
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,860
Either case,

142
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,059
I believe it's enough reason
for your recusal.

143
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,100
Presiding Judge Cha,

144
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:50,000
please make a fair decision
that befits your reputation.

145
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:07,419
We'll first have to check
the validity of the video clips,

146
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:11,090
but if they're real, I'll pass him
over to the disciplinary committee,

147
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:13,559
and I'll also...

148
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,789
exclude him from the judge panel.

149
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,299
You should, of course.

150
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,029
The fact...

151
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:24,669
that I wasn't careful enough
in selecting my associate judges...

152
00:09:24,669 --> 00:09:26,539
cannot call for a recusal,

153
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,539
but I'll seriously consider putting
together a new panel of judges.

154
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,009
Your Honor.

155
00:09:33,309 --> 00:09:37,110
Attorney Bong should be arrested
immediately.

156
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,779
For what reason?

157
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:41,450
The men who caused a ruckus
in the courtroom earlier...

158
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,690
are all his employees.

159
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:47,360
In order to hold us up
and delay the trial,

160
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,799
he brought his employees here
and caused a disturbance.

161
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,330
What he did
immensely dishonored the trial.

162
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,470
Hence, according to Article 61
of the Court Organization Act,

163
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,070
he must be arrested immediately.

164
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,370
Sustained.

165
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,740
Please arrest
Attorney Bong Sang Pil immediately.

166
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,039
Court adjourned.

167
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:15,750
Bong Sang Pil...

168
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,990
Why you...

169
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,360
I was right, wasn't I?

170
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,029
Why did you demand a recusal?
That would never happen.

171
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:23,830
You'll find out soon.

172
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:25,600
Do you have any complaints, guys?

173
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,399
Not at all. I've felt insecure about
never having been behind bars.

174
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,370
- Now, I can be confident.
- That's right.

175
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:34,740
I'm excited to go back as well.
It'll boost my confidence.

176
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:39,580
Take care of the firm
for just three days, okay?

177
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,250
Ha Jae I!

178
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,710
What are you thinking... Gosh.

179
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,720
- How nice.
- It's nice here.

180
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,820
Take a seat.

181
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,519
You can do it!

182
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,960
(Ministry of Justice)

183
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:01,500
An attorney challenged the presiding
judge and got arrested.

184
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:04,700
I'm ashamed that
I'm friends with you...

185
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:06,840
because you work with those people.

186
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:08,610
Were we friends?

187
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,639
That's what I wanted to ask
but couldn't.

188
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:14,049
You're definitely brave.

189
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,480
That I admit.

190
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,450
I guess I'll see you again in court
sometime in the future, Yeon Hee.

191
00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:20,789
- I should get going.
- Yes, I really hope we meet again.

192
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:24,190
I want to fight against an attorney
who knows what he or she's doing.

193
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:27,929
Do you think lawyers are just people
who fight against prosecutors?

194
00:11:28,659 --> 00:11:32,629
I think that lawyers
are people who fight prejudice.

195
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:34,700
I'm off.

196
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:36,269
To fight.

197
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,409
All that lawyer can do
is run his mouth.

198
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:45,740
Are you saying he beat...

199
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,009
all of you to a pulp
when you're skilled with knives?

200
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:51,649
He doesn't use a knife, but he does
everything else with bare fists.

201
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:53,580
You and that mouth of yours.

202
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,590
You're giving excuses now?

203
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,759
If you don't even squeal,

204
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:02,389
I'll forgive you for everything.

205
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:04,200
Pardon me?

206
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,850
What was his name again?

207
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,980
That guy. Bong Sang Pil?

208
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,889
I heard that someone
very influential got his back.

209
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:32,860
Who is that?

210
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,389
It's Choi Dae Woong...

211
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:36,889
of the Dae Woong Gang.

212
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,059
It's one of the top three gangs
in Gangbuk District.

213
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:43,529
Rumor has it that he was the one who
groomed Bong Sang Pil into a lawyer.

214
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:44,639
Is that right?

215
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:48,110
Why are you suddenly
curious about Choi Dae Woong?

216
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,110
I'm more curious about that.

217
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:52,610
None of your business.

218
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:59,049
I'm going to give you
a big project soon.

219
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,090
You'd better not make
any mistakes this time.

220
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,789
"A big project"?

221
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:09,059
(Hope Correctional
opens up a bright future.)

222
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,600
- 1, 2.
- Hook! Try to punch me now.

223
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,600
Come on. It's your turn.

224
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,169
Be quiet.

225
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:20,600
Boss.

226
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,539
I didn't mean to kick you
that hard earlier. I'm sorry.

227
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:28,950
I never knew beating someone up
could be that heartbreaking.

228
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,649
Same here.

229
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,980
I sprayed the fire extinguisher
on your face, you know.

230
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,149
Don't even worry about it.

231
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:36,889
We can understand everything,
you know.

232
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,320
Being back here is making me
reminisce the old days.

233
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,889
I must say, it's not bad.

234
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,590
Aren't I right?

235
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:47,529
I feel the same way. It's like
coming home after a long trip.

236
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:49,070
- Really?
- Yes.

237
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,139
Guys, you were all great actors...

238
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:54,070
in court earlier.

239
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:56,110
Keep up the good work.

240
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,269
- No problem.
- Were we good?

241
00:13:58,279 --> 00:13:59,879
Let's fight!

242
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:02,350
- Lawless lawyer!
- Lawyer!

243
00:14:04,549 --> 00:14:06,750
By the way,
what are you going to do now?

244
00:14:07,549 --> 00:14:10,919
What can I do?
Where I go is the right path.

245
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:14,389
I came here with a goal.

246
00:14:14,929 --> 00:14:15,990
Pardon?

247
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:17,830
- Did you come here on purpose?
- Yes.

248
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,429
Go eat somewhere else.

249
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,600
I do not eat with lawbreakers.

250
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:29,240
Let us join you since we're
locked up here together anyway.

251
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,610
Do you even know who I am?

252
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,379
Director of Finance at Kiseong
City Hall, Mr. Oh In Cheol, right?

253
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:37,480
The late Mayor Lee's safe-keeper...

254
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,179
who controlled
all money in the City of Kiseong.

255
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,649
You're the gentleman
who laundered the money...

256
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:44,259
Mayor Lee Young Soo pocketed.

257
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,860
You jerk.

258
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,659
How dare you blabber like that.

259
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:50,759
You wouldn't accept my visits,

260
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:53,059
so I came in here to talk to you.

261
00:14:54,129 --> 00:14:55,629
I'm Attorney Bong Sang Pil.

262
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,639
What? You came in here to see me?

263
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,840
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

264
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,480
Many lives hang in the balance
with that trial.

265
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,840
Get lost.

266
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,509
I don't deal with lawyers.

267
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,950
I hate people like you the most.

268
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:17,190
You ruin others' lives
by sweet talking.

269
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:20,919
You're not wrong, but...

270
00:15:21,389 --> 00:15:24,460
lawyers also salvage a life
that seems hopeless.

271
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,000
Stay away from me.

272
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:27,460
I warned you.

273
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:41,250
Sir, you have a delivery.

274
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:54,559
What's this?

275
00:15:55,629 --> 00:15:56,629
Let's see.

276
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,830
There's no information
of the sender.

277
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:03,000
- Open it.
- Yes, sir.

278
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,139
What is this?

279
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:42,039
(Death)

280
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,379
Some weasel...

281
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:50,909
must have found out
I'm running for mayor...

282
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,279
and is trying to threaten me.

283
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,970
Anyway,

284
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:15,210
let Bong Sang Pil be for now.

285
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:16,769
Yes, sir.

286
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:19,009
Once I'm mayor,

287
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,450
I can easily get rid of him.

288
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:24,309
Yes, sir.

289
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:34,359
(Judge's Chambers, Cha Moon Sook)

290
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,869
It seems you're here
on business today.

291
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,440
How did you know?

292
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:48,009
It's written on your face.

293
00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:50,839
You're here to ask me
for a difficult favor.

294
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:53,910
- That's right.
- What is it?

295
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,710
I wanted to apply for a continuance.

296
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,450
Attorney Bong went to jail...

297
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:03,190
when he had just barely
taken over this case.

298
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,559
He'll need time
to prepare for trial.

299
00:18:07,259 --> 00:18:09,059
I'm not granting your request.

300
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:11,029
- Ma'am...
- Walk with me.

301
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:18,069
He only pointed out the misconduct
of the assistant judge.

302
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:21,000
He wasn't trying to come after you.

303
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:25,480
He needs time to prepare
for the trial. If he's in prison...

304
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,680
You can do it.

305
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,509
- Sorry?
- If Attorney Bong can't,

306
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,019
you do it.

307
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,950
You're a lawyer too.

308
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:47,200
You seem comfortable
like a long-term inmate.

309
00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:51,099
I'm known to command a whole stage.

310
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:53,140
Didn't you see it at the office?

311
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:56,910
A shot from every angle is killer.

312
00:18:57,339 --> 00:18:59,480
My request for
a continuance was denied...

313
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,910
by Judge Cha.

314
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,910
Did you ask her personally?

315
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,880
The trial is the day
after you're released from prison.

316
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,890
Did...

317
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:11,559
Did you get in this mess
not knowing that?

318
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,059
You're briefing our schedule now.

319
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:15,890
You seem like a real paralegal now.

320
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:18,660
You don't have time to prepare
for the trial.

321
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:19,799
Do you get it?

322
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,299
I have you,

323
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,309
Attorney Ha.

324
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:31,140
Now you call me a lawyer.

325
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,180
Be honest with yourself
and ask yourself...

326
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,009
if you've ever acted like
a paralegal.

327
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:36,009
What?

328
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:38,619
You've been sticking
your nose in everywhere...

329
00:19:38,619 --> 00:19:40,650
as if you're the attorney
which has been annoying.

330
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:46,589
To confront a problematic judge
like that in court...

331
00:19:46,589 --> 00:19:48,490
isn't easy.

332
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:49,960
You did a good job.

333
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,029
Do you need anything?

334
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,440
What do I need?

335
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,599
Let me see.

336
00:20:00,869 --> 00:20:02,339
- Well...
- Forget it.

337
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,210
I'll see you.

338
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:07,440
I believe in you, Jae I.

339
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,269
I heard you had
the best hands in the country,

340
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:34,970
and I can tell by just watching.

341
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:37,240
She applies perfect pressure.

342
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,150
You probably know that Judge Cha
is the face of Kiseong.

343
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,519
I don't know who she is,

344
00:20:48,089 --> 00:20:50,119
but she's getting smile lines.

345
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,420
How could you know that?

346
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:58,460
You know, getting rid of them
is the trend these days.

347
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,160
How can be a judge
if I do what everyone else does?

348
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,670
I'm sorry.
That was very ignorant of me.

349
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,339
I should take a nap.

350
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,470
Of course.

351
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,670
I'll take care of a few things then.

352
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,380
I see he hit the big three.

353
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:22,220
Embezzlement, breach of duty
and out-of-country assets.

354
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,019
5.1 million dollars in total?

355
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:29,589
He violated Article 5 of
the Specific Economic Crimes.

356
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:32,029
That means he'll
at least get 10 years.

357
00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:33,529
He'll get life if he's unlucky.

358
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:37,799
Look at you. You've become
an expert on law yourself.

359
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,839
So can you make it go away?

360
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:41,839
We'll have to make sure
that it does.

361
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:45,579
I'm only taking this case
because it's you.

362
00:21:45,579 --> 00:21:49,380
Of course.
I know you enough to realize that.

363
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,950
I'll have the victim write
a petition for non-punishment...

364
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,680
and get him out on probation.

365
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:56,589
There's really nothing I can't do.

366
00:21:57,619 --> 00:22:00,490
He wanted advice on
his out-of-country assets.

367
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,259
Tell him to set up a corporation.

368
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:04,730
Not in the States,
but somewhere in Europe.

369
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:08,799
This is a piece of property that
you won't be disappointed with.

370
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,569
All the tax has been paid for.

371
00:22:10,569 --> 00:22:11,569
(Registration Certificate)

372
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:13,140
It's Yoon Soo this time?

373
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,210
And this is smart Yoon Soo,
who gets good grades.

374
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:23,579
Like always, I don't need to worry
when I give you a task.

375
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,279
You're so meticulous.

376
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:33,089
Are they using that photo
to make Judge Cha Byung Ho's statue?

377
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:37,630
I still can't believe
that I was the Cha family's...

378
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,660
exclusive photographer.

379
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,230
You always mention that.

380
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:45,200
He only smiled
in front of my camera.

381
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,069
It was such an honor.

382
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,410
He pretty much paid for
your law school tuition.

383
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,210
That's kind of stretching it.

384
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:02,720
It was the money you and Mom made
while taking photographs every day.

385
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:06,390
Yes, and Judge Cha Byung Ho
paid for his photos.

386
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:11,160
Anyway, I'm going to
support Judge Cha Moon Sook...

387
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:13,700
until her very last trial.

388
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,339
Did you take care of Golden City?

389
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:24,910
When have you ever seen me
not do anything perfectly?

390
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,680
There's still so much to do.

391
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:30,009
Who else would do it other than me?

392
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:33,019
Goodness.

393
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,119
What are you doing?

394
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:41,890
Are you seeking credit?

395
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,630
I apologize.

396
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,700
Whenever you see a gap,
you always try to slither up.

397
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:48,799
Leave if it's too much.

398
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,140
Don't you dare...

399
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,369
exploit my trust.

400
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:57,109
Judge Cha, when have I ever...

401
00:23:59,009 --> 00:24:03,609
To be honest,
you're closer to Ha Jae I anyway.

402
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,049
It's upsetting.

403
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,220
- What?
- Who's more important?

404
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,150
Me or that cow?

405
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:14,220
Shut that pretty mouth of yours.

406
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,460
Just know this.

407
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:21,230
The person I show my feelings to
is at a disadvantage.

408
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,309
You must've finished your service...

409
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,839
and are on your way home.

410
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,880
I bet you're exhausted.

411
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,609
Judge Cha is asleep.

412
00:24:34,609 --> 00:24:35,910
Call again tomorrow.

413
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:39,920
You're trying to show off
your power, aren't you?

414
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:42,789
Anyway, that's not why I called.

415
00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:45,460
I need you to schedule a meeting.

416
00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:49,930
I must speak with the judge
about something important.

417
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:52,730
What is it about?

418
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,759
Why would you want to know?

419
00:24:55,069 --> 00:24:56,369
Let's hang up.

420
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,900
Why he... Has he gone crazy?

421
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,609

(Kiseong Police Department)

424
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:31,170
It's most likely that he'll be found
guilty. You want to snatch the case?

425
00:25:31,369 --> 00:25:32,440
Yes.

426
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:35,009
Aren't there too many
pieces of evidence?

427
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,869
It's suspicious.

428
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,410
I trust you, Ha Jae I.

- Let's take a photo.
- Okay.

- What's this?
- He said it's for you.

00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:34,599
"He"?

- Hey.
- Okay.

Eat time you have some of this soup,

471
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:47,059
you wonder why you're in with these
common criminals, don't you?

472
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:50,529
I don't know anything, so get lost.

473
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:52,799
I never asked if you knew anything.

474
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,829
You forged the mayor's seal
to embezzle...

475
00:29:54,829 --> 00:29:57,630
150,000 dollars of
the city's budget.

476
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,910
Someone tipped me off
about your corrupt behavior.

477
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:05,509
The trial's being processed.

478
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:10,880
You admitted to the charges
which is why you're in here.

479
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,819
However,

480
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:17,220
compared to what you used to do,

481
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,619
I think the amount is
way too little.

482
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:23,130
There should be at least
one more zero.

483
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:26,000
Why you little...

484
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:28,000
You'll be released
just around the time...

will be wrapped up.

That's my guess.

487
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,769
Shut your mouth!

488
00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:36,309
- What's going on?
- Watch it.

489
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,880
- Let it go.
- What a temper.

490
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:43,109
Mr. Oh.

491
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:46,250
You're the one who sent in the tip
about yourself, right?

492
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,049
- What?
- You did that...

493
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:50,890
to end up in here, right?

494
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,289
To live.

495
00:30:54,289 --> 00:30:56,730
- How dare you keep...
- But...

496
00:30:57,259 --> 00:31:01,200
do you think this place
is really safe?

497
00:31:04,269 --> 00:31:07,470
Which is your real facade?

498
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,509
What?

499
00:31:10,109 --> 00:31:12,539
I met your wife.

500
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,210
Why did you go there for?

501
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:21,019
I wanted to find out
what you're really like.

502
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,319
Tell me the truth.

503
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:30,130
Is it true you were with
the witness, Mr. Kang,

504
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,829
who was at the first hearing?

505
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:36,200
Yes. Yes, I was with him,
I'm sure about that.

506
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,470
Then why won't he testify to it?

507
00:31:44,109 --> 00:31:46,609
(Game Arcade)

508
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:58,549
Do you want to play?

509
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,490
Are you Mr. Kang?

510
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,930
I'm Attorney Ha Jae I.

511
00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:07,099
An attorney?

512
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:12,069
I'm defending Wu Hyung Man.

513
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,900
Can I ask you a few questions?

514
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,910
Is an attorney allowed to
barge in and ask questions?

515
00:32:19,579 --> 00:32:20,710
Sorry.

516
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,680
Can you please help?

517
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,779
If it's about the trial,
please leave.

518
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,920
I told the police
I don't know anything.

519
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:31,220
The day Mayor Lee Young Soo
was murdered,

520
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,759
11:30pm on March 22, 2018.

521
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:37,059
You were with
Wu Hyung Man, weren't you?

522
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:41,930
I said leave.

523
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:48,000
I know Detective Wu had given you
a hard time prior to that.

524
00:32:48,569 --> 00:32:51,609
But you can't put away
a man who isn't guilty for murder.

525
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,309
He's not guilty?

526
00:32:55,509 --> 00:32:56,779
Did that jerk say that?

527
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,349
Miss.

528
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,819
Look at this
and tell me he's not guilty.

529
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:15,500
- Go.
- Please help me, Mr. Kang.

530
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,700
Darn it!

531
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:18,900
I said get out.

532
00:33:19,869 --> 00:33:21,440
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

533
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,680
I asked you to get me out,

534
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,049
and you end up here instead?

535
00:33:31,049 --> 00:33:34,619
You wouldn't know I'm in this mess
trying to get you out.

536
00:33:34,849 --> 00:33:36,549
What are you talking about?

537
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,390
If you don't get it, just eat up.

538
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,559
Did you say her name was
Ha Jae I?

539
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,900
Your paralegal came to see me.

540
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:50,500
Good for you. You have
an attorney for a paralegal.

541
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,440
She's doing her job, then.

542
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:54,640
I said get out!

543
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:58,039
I'd just love for
that detective to die.

544
00:33:58,039 --> 00:34:00,009
- Mr. Kang.
- Don't come here.

545
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:01,680
- Please.
- Go.

546
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,279
Mr. Kang, please...

547
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:06,619
Please help me out. Mr. Kang.

548
00:34:06,619 --> 00:34:07,650
Mr. Kang.

549
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:16,860
Pass the ball. Kick it.

550
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,570
- The ball.
- Pass the ball.

551
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:23,630
Pass the ball.

552
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:24,969
The ball.

553
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:30,239
We asked.

554
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:34,980
Boys, let's go.

555
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,010
Yes, boss.

556
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:37,449
They're trying to kill him.

557
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,719
- Fight!
- Come here, you jerk.

558
00:34:49,789 --> 00:34:51,929
- I'll teach you a lesson.
- What's your problem?

559
00:35:00,769 --> 00:35:02,309
Come here, you little...

560
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,769
Break it up already!

561
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,940
Bong Sang Pil.

562
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,239
That rat...

563
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,150
Break it up!

564
00:35:12,579 --> 00:35:14,449
Calm down. Relax.

565
00:35:14,449 --> 00:35:15,949
- What happened?
- He's hurt.

566
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,519
I know that it was your choice
to come in here,

567
00:35:19,789 --> 00:35:21,960
but I'm sure you're not
having the greatest time here.

568
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:28,199
Isn't Chairman An Oh Ju
involved in the mayor's death?

569
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:34,900
I obviously came here intentionally
because I know about it.

570
00:35:35,809 --> 00:35:38,269
Tell me. Who are you, really?

571
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:39,440
Ohju Group...

572
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:43,849
The company grew a lot
during Mayor Lee's term.

573
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:46,650
The company's assets and revenues
grew by five times.

574
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:50,750
It was because Ohju Group got
all the main projects for the city.

575
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:55,460
There are two things
that I want to know.

576
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:59,199
Why did An Oh Ju
get rid of Mayor Lee?

577
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,260
And...

578
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:03,130
why did Wu Hyung Man
get framed for the murder?

579
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:06,500
I don't know whether that detective
killed the mayor or not.

580
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:09,639
But I do know the answer
to your first question.

581
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:10,710
Mayor Lee...

582
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,139
Why was he killed?

583
00:36:13,139 --> 00:36:14,280
Have you...

584
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:16,650
heard of "The Golden City"?

585
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:20,420
It's the biggest redevelopment
project in Kiseong's history.

586
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:22,820
The plan failed once 18 years ago,

587
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:26,119
but it's starting again.

588
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,960
"The Golden City"?

589
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,559
This will be our campaign office.

590
00:36:33,829 --> 00:36:35,300
Our campaign office.

591
00:36:35,699 --> 00:36:37,000
We'll open the office here.

592
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:38,730
Are you running for office?

593
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,510
Are you cut out for the job
of mayor of Kiseong?

594
00:36:43,809 --> 00:36:46,280
Then the big project
you mentioned was...

595
00:36:46,409 --> 00:36:48,780
The mayor position
has been vacant for a while,

596
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,550
and they need it filled.

597
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,679
I should fill the position,
don't you think?

598
00:36:55,719 --> 00:36:56,889
And...

599
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:00,360
I want you to be
my campaign director.

600
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,659
Does that mean
you'll forgive me, Boss?

601
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:07,030
I'll forgive you,

602
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:10,800
and I'll even make you
my campaign director.

603
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,900
What will you...

604
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,900
do for me in return?

605
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:18,840
Boss, I can do anything
to help you get elected as mayor.

606
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,340
This is precisely why
I say that you just don't get it.

607
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:25,280
Don't say, "I can do anything."

608
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:26,650
"Boss,"

609
00:37:27,449 --> 00:37:28,780
"what can I do..."

610
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,190
"to please you?"

611
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:33,619
You should've asked me like that.

612
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:37,860
Boss!

613
00:37:38,329 --> 00:37:40,530
Even if I have to get blood
on my hands,

614
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:44,030
I'll do whatever it takes
to make you the mayor of Kiseong.

615
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:46,139
Now, we're talking.

616
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,010
Do a good job.

617
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:52,480
Mayor Lee was against
The Golden City project,

618
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,780
so that's why he got rid of him?

619
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,610
I'm not sure why you got
involved in this,

620
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,250
but I'm going to live
very quietly...

621
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,949
when I get out of here.

622
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:04,619
And I don't...

623
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:06,789
know you anymore.

624
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,429
So An Oh Ju is...

625
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,369
trying to become the mayor
of Kiseong?

626
00:38:18,969 --> 00:38:21,000
Young lady, what is your problem?

627
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:22,969
I asked her to bring me here.

628
00:38:22,969 --> 00:38:24,110
What is this about?

629
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,170
You know...

630
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:28,639
that my husband
did terrible things to you...

631
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,280
because of me.

632
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,150
This won't change anything.
Please leave.

633
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,349
Sir.

634
00:38:36,889 --> 00:38:38,389
Please forgive us just this once.

635
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:40,559
Sir, just this once...

636
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:42,389
- If it weren't for me...
- Gosh.

637
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:45,260
You know that he would've
never done things like that.

638
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:48,260
All right, fine. Please sit.

639
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,170
Why aren't you taking her
to a hospital?

640
00:38:51,699 --> 00:38:54,099
Mr. Kang, you can't get
Detective Wu's trial...

641
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,440
out of your mind, right?

642
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,510
What?

643
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:00,239
You said you want him to be punished
with the death penalty right away.

644
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,309
Then why do you keep worrying
about him?

645
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,710
No!

646
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:06,349
Your Honor, that can't happen.

647
00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:07,449
- Absolutely not!
- Your Honor.

648
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:09,519
Attorney Bong should be arrested
immediately.

649
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:11,889
That was because I wanted to see him
getting the death penalty...

650
00:39:11,889 --> 00:39:13,989
You're torn.

651
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:17,829
You're feeling guilty
about framing him as a murderer.

652
00:39:23,469 --> 00:39:25,699
Guys, let's go!

653
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:27,400
- My gosh!
- Nice, we're free now.

654
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,440
Let's go home.

655
00:39:28,539 --> 00:39:30,369
Thanks to you,
we could enjoy our stay.

656
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:31,539
Don't come back ever again.

657
00:39:31,539 --> 00:39:33,139
Okay! Take it easy, Officer!

658
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,539
- Take care.
- You heard that, right?

659
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:38,050
He sincerely wished us well.

660
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:39,349
Did you hear that?

661
00:39:39,579 --> 00:39:42,219
By the way, you couldn't persuade
Director Oh. What will you do now?

662
00:39:42,619 --> 00:39:46,090
I know I came here empty-handed,
but I won't leave with nothing.

663
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,489
Just wait and see.

664
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:52,530
Ms. Ha.

665
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:54,860
Oh, my. You came to pick us up.

666
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,570
- Shouldn't you be at the office?
- It's before my work hours.

667
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:59,570
There's no extra pay
for starting early.

668
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:01,340
You know that, right?

669
00:40:01,739 --> 00:40:04,710
You're talking as if
I've been getting overtime pay.

670
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:05,909
I'm speechless.

671
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:09,409
I was just wondering...
Did you get things like tofu...

672
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,409
for us by any chance?

673
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,920
That'd be useless because it won't
purify you. Why would I bother?

674
00:40:17,219 --> 00:40:19,219
- Lawless, Lawless!
- Lawless, Lawless!

675
00:40:19,219 --> 00:40:21,389
Ms. Ha, you're the best!

676
00:40:21,389 --> 00:40:23,889
Boss, I'm so excited
to eat normal food.

677
00:40:24,929 --> 00:40:27,500
So we're getting jajangmyeon
instead of tofu.

678
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,269
I'll eat it since you got it for us.

679
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:42,139
Since you're all black inside,

680
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:43,809
this won't even show.

681
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:47,980
- Boss.
- Boss.

682
00:40:50,349 --> 00:40:51,420
My gosh.

683
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:03,230
- One for all and all for one!
- One for all and all for one!

684
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:14,980
- We're free!
- We're free now!

685
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,179
The breeze feels so nice!

686
00:41:16,179 --> 00:41:17,780
- Boss!
- Just go in the water!

687
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,880
- Come on.
- All right, here we go.

688
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:23,289
- 1, 2, 3!
- 1, 2, 3!

689
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:29,090
Mr. Kang decided to testify for
Wu Hyung Man to prove his alibi.

690
00:41:30,829 --> 00:41:33,960
Does that mean you
believe that he's not guilty now?

691
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:35,900
Yes, I do.

692
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:38,099
His alibi checks out.

693
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,000
I want his wife...

694
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:43,969
to see him getting acquitted.

695
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,079
We have to make it happen.

696
00:41:46,539 --> 00:41:47,639
But...

697
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:51,909
this is the beginning
of what attorneys fear the most.

698
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,989
Defending an innocent person
and losing is much worse...

699
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:58,119
than defending someone
who's guilty and losing.

700
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:01,119
It can make you extremely anxious.

701
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,289
Right, that's why we must fight
and win...

702
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:06,400
with the law.

703
00:42:08,699 --> 00:42:09,730
With the law.

704
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:15,070
- Let's go!
- Hey, guys. Wait!

705
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:18,639
- Hey, no! Don't!
- Here we go!

706
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:21,539
- One!
- No!

707
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,210
- Two!
- Don't do this!

708
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,880
- 3!
- 3!

709
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:36,659
- Ms. Ha!
- Ms. Ha!

710
00:42:36,659 --> 00:42:38,389
Get over here!

711
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,010
Are you in a good mood today?

712
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:52,269
Bong Sang Pil.

713
00:42:53,909 --> 00:42:56,380
You're one impressive jerk!

714
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:03,349
You just punched your attorney
when you're locked up here.

715
00:43:04,219 --> 00:43:05,550
Why did I get punched?

716
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:09,119
An Oh Ju wouldn't scare me
and just end it at that.

717
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:11,289
Had he wanted me gone,

718
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:13,159
he would've killed me
a long time ago.

719
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:14,659
Like what he did to Mayor Lee?

720
00:43:14,659 --> 00:43:17,730
You're the only one who'd
threaten me with my life now.

721
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:19,369
I see that you still have
good instincts.

722
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:21,599
- Detectives sure are different.
- What?

723
00:43:21,739 --> 00:43:23,409
Don't be too upset.

724
00:43:23,869 --> 00:43:25,869
I'm your attorney now, you know.

725
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,840
I told you that I'll get you out.

726
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,010
You little...

727
00:43:37,849 --> 00:43:38,849
Or...

728
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:41,320
Should I kill you here?

729
00:43:42,059 --> 00:43:43,059
What?

730
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:44,329
Your life...

731
00:43:45,429 --> 00:43:46,659
belongs to me now.

732
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:56,440
An Oh Ju isn't...

733
00:43:57,409 --> 00:43:58,710
the only one pulling the strings.

734
00:43:59,409 --> 00:44:00,409
What?

735
00:44:05,449 --> 00:44:07,480
He's just a puppet too.

736
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,619
A real puppet master exists.

737
00:44:10,449 --> 00:44:11,820
What are you talking about?

738
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:13,960
It's the presiding judge
on your case,

739
00:44:14,989 --> 00:44:16,929
Judge Cha Moon Sook.

740
00:44:17,929 --> 00:44:21,130
Attorney Bong is released today,
right?

741
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:23,300
Yes, I came from a meeting with him.

742
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:26,239
I'm sure he's not sorry
for his actions.

743
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:29,969
Jae I,

744
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,809
I worry that you trust people
too easily.

745
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:35,739
- Me?
- You should be aware of those...

746
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:36,809
who will abuse that trust.

747
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,750
(Chairman An)

748
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,590
Judge Cha.

749
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:54,260
A witness will testify in court
to verify...

750
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:56,570
Wu Hyung Man's alibi.

751
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:00,440
- Really?
- He's too much of a liability.

752
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,440
I'll take care of it myself.

753
00:45:04,409 --> 00:45:07,179
I don't know if that's necessary.

754
00:45:07,179 --> 00:45:08,210
Is that so?

755
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,949
Are you saying
you'll kill him yourself...

756
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:15,980
with the law?

757
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:17,420
It's called "killing by law".

758
00:45:18,219 --> 00:45:20,019
She takes the case
of who she wants to kill...

759
00:45:20,019 --> 00:45:21,489
and does it with the law.

760
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:24,230
That's Cha Moon Sook.

761
00:45:37,739 --> 00:45:40,110
In this trial,
our opponent is the judge,

762
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:41,710
not the prosecutor.

763
00:45:44,809 --> 00:45:46,920
Are you trying to fool me?

764
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,150
Remember this.

765
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:51,449
The only person that can change
the outcome of this trial...

766
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,119
is an attorney.

767
00:45:54,659 --> 00:45:57,360
The only crazy fool who can
clear your name...

768
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,599
is me.

769
00:46:04,829 --> 00:46:06,599
Don't forget to pay back
your loans.

770
00:46:06,869 --> 00:46:08,469
- Have fun.
- Sure.

771
00:46:08,869 --> 00:46:11,510
- Did you find anything?
- Where is he?

772
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:13,710
You startled me as well.

773
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:16,039
Wu Hyung Man doesn't
use the front door.

774
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:17,650
You'll never find him there.

775
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,980
Do you have a camera
at the back entrance too?

776
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:22,889
- Yes.
- Why didn't you tell us sooner?

777
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:25,150
Here it is.

778
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:28,190
Darn it.

779
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:31,360
He always used the back entrance.

780
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,929
He'd come in,

781
00:46:33,099 --> 00:46:34,929
draw this half-way,

782
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:36,800
and hand me the money.

783
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,199
Then the camera
couldn't have caught much.

784
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:41,670
That prick.

785
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:44,309
- Are you reporting me again?
- Hello?

786
00:46:44,309 --> 00:46:45,869
I know you have your camera on.

787
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:47,480
Give me that!

788
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,340
- Get over here.
- What did I do?

789
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,010
You're always picking on me.

790
00:46:54,219 --> 00:46:55,519
Geum Kang, you punk!

791
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:05,860
It's here. He recorded it!

792
00:47:06,329 --> 00:47:07,360
You're our lifesaver!

793
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:13,599
That's right.

794
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:18,869
I know.
He changes color like a chameleon.

795
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:34,989
- What is it?
- Then don't talk about it.

796
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:36,889
It's nothing.

797
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:45,769
Yes, of course.

798
00:47:59,949 --> 00:48:02,920
Why did An Oh Ju
cast you as the male lead...

799
00:48:04,219 --> 00:48:06,019
in the murder of
Mayor Lee Young Soo?

800
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,960
I already told you.

801
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,360
I don't know.

802
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:12,960
I didn't quite get it,

803
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,500
but I think I get it now.

804
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:17,170
What is it?

805
00:48:20,139 --> 00:48:22,099
Before he becomes mayor,

806
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:25,570
he wants to wipe off
all the dirt from his body.

807
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:29,139
You rolled with him
in the fish market for 20 years.

808
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:33,349
He knew I had dirt on him,

809
00:48:33,849 --> 00:48:35,449
so he got to me first.

810
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:40,320
Those with weaknesses
have the most to worry about.

811
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,730
An Oh Ju, that scumbag.

812
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:46,699
Here comes Judge Cha Moon Sook.

813
00:48:46,699 --> 00:48:47,800
All rise!

814
00:48:56,909 --> 00:48:59,840
March 22, 2018,
on the day of the incident...

815
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,239
at around 11pm,

816
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,610
you were with someone.
Do you remember him?

817
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:07,219
- Yes, I do.
- Who is it,

818
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:08,519
and where were you two?

819
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:12,349
I was with Detective Wu
at the arcade I own.

820
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,320
Are you sure?

821
00:49:14,889 --> 00:49:16,019
Yes, I'm sure.

822
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:22,530
Your Honor, as you just heard,
the witness...

823
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:25,429
just proved the defendant's alibi.

824
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:27,570
Nothing further, Your Honor.

825
00:49:28,139 --> 00:49:30,269
Prosecution, you may cross examine.

826
00:49:30,269 --> 00:49:31,809
Let me ask the witness.

827
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:34,139
Did Attorney Bong...

828
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:36,139
- threaten you?
- Your Honor!

829
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,280
Or did he promise you
something in return?

830
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,119
- Your Honor.
- Or...

831
00:49:40,119 --> 00:49:42,420
- was it both?
- Objection!

832
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,190
The prosecution is slandering...

833
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,320
both the witness and me.

834
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,929
Sustained. The prosecution
will watch its words.

835
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:51,159
My apologies.

836
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:52,860
Your Honor,

837
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:56,500
I submit this witness statement
written by the lead detective...

838
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,900
as evidence.

839
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,570
Carry on.

840
00:50:02,369 --> 00:50:05,510
You were questioned as a witness,
were you not?

841
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:07,239
Yes, I was.

842
00:50:07,539 --> 00:50:09,280
You stated that...

843
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,579
you weren't with
the defendant at the time.

844
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:14,650
- Yes, that's right.
- Then I'll ask you again.

845
00:50:15,219 --> 00:50:18,019
Did Attorney Bong threaten you
of offer you a compensation...

846
00:50:18,019 --> 00:50:20,159
- Your Honor!
- Why has...

847
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:22,219
your statement about that night...

848
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:24,360
completely changed?

849
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:28,260
Back then, I lied.

850
00:50:29,329 --> 00:50:30,699
This is the truth.

851
00:50:30,699 --> 00:50:32,530
I was with Detective Wu.

852
00:50:35,639 --> 00:50:37,739
How can we trust
the words of a man...

853
00:50:37,739 --> 00:50:39,239
who already lied once?

854
00:50:41,579 --> 00:50:42,940
We have a video as proof.

855
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:46,050
Your Honor, this evidence
was never disclosed beforehand.

856
00:50:46,579 --> 00:50:48,550
We only persuaded
the witness last night,

857
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:51,519
and we found the video
just 30 minutes before the trial.

858
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:53,659
I apologize for not informing you.

859
00:50:53,659 --> 00:50:55,889
Your Honor,
the prosecution won't accept this.

860
00:50:55,889 --> 00:50:57,690
Shouldn't you watch it first?

861
00:50:57,690 --> 00:50:58,789
Your Honor!

862
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:06,500
Fine.

863
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,639
I won't watch the video just yet,

864
00:51:09,639 --> 00:51:13,309
but I will accept a transcript
of the contents of it.

865
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:35,929
Once the video has
been authenticated,

866
00:51:36,199 --> 00:51:38,670
I will decide on whether it's valid.

867
00:51:45,539 --> 00:51:48,679
You know,
Bong Sang Pil's a cute one.

868
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:50,650
What do you think will happen?

869
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:54,019
Judge Cha Moon Sook...

870
00:51:54,019 --> 00:51:56,750
will never accept
that video as evidence.

871
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:58,119
Sorry?

872
00:51:58,250 --> 00:51:59,320
Enough of this.

873
00:51:59,789 --> 00:52:01,489
Run along and...

874
00:52:01,989 --> 00:52:03,730
find the one that used the knife.

875
00:52:04,159 --> 00:52:07,260
Take him out to sea
and sink him deep underwater.

876
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,360
Yes, sir.

877
00:52:12,469 --> 00:52:14,269
Watch where you're going.

878
00:52:16,769 --> 00:52:18,070
It's too early to celebrate.

879
00:52:18,309 --> 00:52:20,679
The video is fuzzy, but
you can still make out the people.

880
00:52:20,739 --> 00:52:22,340
It'll be accepted as evidence.

881
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:24,179
Some get acquitted these days...

882
00:52:24,179 --> 00:52:25,980
because a confession
didn't include "I".

883
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:28,780
It's not over until it's over.

884
00:52:31,449 --> 00:52:32,949
We need to catch the real killer.

885
00:52:33,289 --> 00:52:34,690
- "The real killer"?
- Yes.

886
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,860
We can only win when
we present the real killer.

887
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:39,590
Sang Pil,

888
00:52:39,929 --> 00:52:42,099
you're an attorney, not a detective.

889
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,929
Sir, we put on the tracker.

890
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:46,869
He's not taking his usual route.

891
00:52:46,869 --> 00:52:47,869
Okay.

892
00:52:47,969 --> 00:52:49,739
The video must've
made him desperate.

893
00:52:51,139 --> 00:52:53,610
"A tracker"?
Are you following someone?

894
00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:55,840
Ms. Ha, let's get going first.

895
00:52:56,179 --> 00:52:58,050
You guys can take my car.

896
00:53:02,519 --> 00:53:06,090
So he'll take us to
where the real killer is?

897
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:08,659
Yes, but he doesn't know that.

898
00:53:08,889 --> 00:53:11,159
- Who is he?
- He is Chairman An's...

899
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:13,230
chief secretary and right-hand man.

900
00:53:14,329 --> 00:53:16,059
Is Ohju Group involved...

901
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:17,769
with Mayor Lee's murder?

902
00:53:17,769 --> 00:53:19,329
We'll know soon enough.

903
00:53:25,539 --> 00:53:27,610
Thanks to your great
and honorable daughter,

904
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,210
Judge Cha Moon Sook,

905
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:34,550
I've been given a shot at
becoming the mayor of Kiseong.

906
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:47,530
Is he the legendary
Judge Cha Byung Ho?

907
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:50,000
Judge Cha Moon Sook's father?

908
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,329
Gwan Dong.

909
00:53:52,099 --> 00:53:53,340
Yes, Boss.

910
00:53:54,769 --> 00:53:56,440
A human being...

911
00:53:57,670 --> 00:54:01,579
becomes useful
once in their lifetime.

912
00:54:02,510 --> 00:54:04,409
When I was your age,

913
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:07,519
this old gentleman...

914
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:10,119
said that to me.

915
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:12,650
I'll remember that, Boss.

916
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:13,860
I think...

917
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:18,760
the time in your life is
right about now.

918
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:21,960
Who'd have thought that
you would ever...

919
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,230
head the campaign thing...

920
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:26,840
that would make me mayor?

921
00:54:27,269 --> 00:54:28,800
You're right, Boss.

922
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,039
So,

923
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:33,110
both you and I...

924
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:38,079
cannot miss this opportunity
no matter what.

925
00:54:49,059 --> 00:54:50,460
- Look.
- Okay.

926
00:54:50,889 --> 00:54:52,260
Do you recognize him?

927
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,559
Him?

928
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:58,329
He's one of Kiseong's famous
stowaway brokers.

929
00:54:58,570 --> 00:54:59,969
- "Stowaway"?
- Yes.

930
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:02,070
Do you remember
the construction company CEO,

931
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:03,510
who disappeared
after going bankrupt?

932
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:06,309
Hey, there are more than
one of those guys.

933
00:55:06,309 --> 00:55:07,539
Anyway,

934
00:55:07,809 --> 00:55:10,710
this guy helps you take your wife,

935
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:13,380
kids and even mistress abroad.

936
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:14,420
For the right price.

937
00:55:14,579 --> 00:55:17,789
Why is An Oh Ju's secretary
meeting a stowaway broker?

938
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:19,750
That's...

939
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:22,989
Don't you smell
the stench of crime already?

940
00:55:25,329 --> 00:55:26,559
He's out.

941
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,530
What's with this unexpected
physical contact?

942
00:55:34,469 --> 00:55:35,869
He's on the move.

943
00:55:35,869 --> 00:55:37,409
Let's begin.

944
00:55:37,409 --> 00:55:38,409
Yes, Boss.

945
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:40,139
Wait.

946
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:43,079
You block his escape route
from the outside.

947
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:44,179
- "His escape route"?
- Yes.

948
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:51,949
He's at it again. That really hurt.

949
00:55:51,949 --> 00:55:54,320
How can there be no elevator?
My legs hurt.

950
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:58,389
Doesn't Attorney Bong
carry any weapons?

951
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:00,900
A knife, metal bar, baseball bat.

952
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:04,829
I never saw him use a weapon
for as long as I served him.

953
00:56:14,409 --> 00:56:15,579
I hate...

954
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:20,320
whatever ruins my suited look
more than anything.

955
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:23,280
Whether it's a person or a weapon.

956
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:46,940
Who...

957
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:53,050
Short track speed skater, Kim
Dong Sung, won the gold this way.

958
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:55,780
What am I blocking?

959
00:56:58,719 --> 00:56:59,820
Sorry.

960
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:08,900
No!

961
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:11,500
Why did you meet Ohju Group's
chairman's secretary?

962
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:12,730
Who's that?

963
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:15,199
The suited guy
you met in your office.

964
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:17,510
- He's a secretary?
- You really don't know?

965
00:57:18,469 --> 00:57:21,380
I really don't,
I don't know anything.

966
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:26,820
We'll see if you don't know
to the very end.

967
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:30,320
Boss, he's really getting too heavy.

968
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:34,559
I can't hold on much longer.

969
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,230
Well done. Let him go.

970
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:41,800
- Go!
- Wait, wait. I'll talk.

971
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,469
Please, I'll tell you.

972
00:57:44,869 --> 00:57:46,329
You should've spoken up sooner.

973
00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:50,440
He wants me to send someone
to China today.

974
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:53,710
- Who?
- I don't have an identity.

975
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:56,039
I only got a photo.

976
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,050
- It's on my phone.
- Your phone?

977
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:02,250
Boss.

978
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:06,219
We agreed to meet each other here.

979
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:09,219
- He's coming here?
- Yes.

980
00:58:10,159 --> 00:58:11,590
- Hey. Put him down.
- Okay.

981
00:58:17,469 --> 00:58:19,630
You should've talked sooner.

982
00:58:24,909 --> 00:58:26,510
Boss, I think that's him.

983
00:58:34,579 --> 00:58:36,480
Hey! Stop!

984
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,019
- Stop right there!
- Hey!

985
00:58:38,019 --> 00:58:39,119
- Stop.
- Don't move!

986
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:40,690
- Stay there!
- Hey!

987
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:42,820
Come back! Stop where you are!

988
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:08,750
Nice one, Ms. Ha.

989
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:09,949
Bong Sang Pil!

990
00:59:19,659 --> 00:59:20,699
Hey!

991
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:41,880
I am so sorry.

992
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:44,250
Who are you?

993
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:46,489
Stop it!

994
00:59:48,389 --> 00:59:49,590
What's wrong with you?

995
01:01:37,929 --> 01:01:38,929
Bong Sang Pil.

996
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:45,239
Who ordered you to kill the mayor?

997
01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:47,480
Let go of me.

998
01:01:48,539 --> 01:01:50,880
It was Chairman An Oh Ju, wasn't it?

999
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:53,110
Who are you?

1000
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:55,980
You needn't tell me here.

1001
01:01:56,449 --> 01:01:59,789
You'll end up
confessing to it in court.

1002
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:04,929
Bong Sang Pil!

1003
01:02:33,489 --> 01:02:34,989
No, run.

1004
01:02:34,989 --> 01:02:36,760
No! Hurry!

1005
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:41,559
Drop that knife.

1006
01:02:43,969 --> 01:02:45,030
Attorney Bong.

1007
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:50,099
If she gets...

1008
01:02:51,710 --> 01:02:53,840
a single scratch
anywhere on her body,

1009
01:02:55,139 --> 01:02:56,840
I'll kill you.

1010
01:03:10,730 --> 01:03:12,289
You jerk!

1011
01:03:16,059 --> 01:03:17,170
Stop.

1012
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:18,670
Sang Pil, that's enough!

1013
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,369
Sang Pil, stop!

1014
01:03:22,369 --> 01:03:23,369
Get up!

1015
01:03:23,969 --> 01:03:25,309
Stop it!

1016
01:03:25,739 --> 01:03:27,980
- Let go of me.
- Stop!

1017
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:34,550
I'll tell you.

1018
01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:38,019
I was ordered to kill
Mayor Lee Young Soo...

1019
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:49,059
by An Oh Ju.

1020
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:52,929
I'll show you...

1021
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:56,170
how he has gotten away
with all the dirty things...

1022
01:03:57,710 --> 01:03:59,070
he has done.

1023
01:03:59,070 --> 01:04:01,010
There's no need to go
all the way to court.

1024
01:04:01,010 --> 01:04:02,110
I'll show you here.

1025
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,019
Ms. Ha.

1026
01:04:21,099 --> 01:04:22,159
Look at me.

1027
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:24,400
Ms. Ha.

1028
01:04:25,969 --> 01:04:27,130
Jae I!

1029
01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:48,389
(Lawless Lawyer)

1030
01:04:49,059 --> 01:04:51,130
What you know is all a lie.

1031
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:53,559
I don't doubt the people I trust.

1032
01:04:54,929 --> 01:04:55,929
My gosh.

1033
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:58,829
If I'm being fooled by Judge Cha,
prove it to me.

1034
01:04:58,829 --> 01:05:00,199
Aren't you curious...

1035
01:05:00,199 --> 01:05:03,369
as to who ordered the hit
on Mayor Lee Young Soo?

1036
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:06,440
- Judge Cha...
- My courtroom is sacred.

1037
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:07,639
No one can intrude.

1038
01:05:07,639 --> 01:05:11,010
You punks. How dare
you interfere with this trial?

1039
01:05:11,809 --> 01:05:13,050
Jae I.

1040
01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:15,380
I need to protect you...

1041
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:16,880
from everything and anything.
