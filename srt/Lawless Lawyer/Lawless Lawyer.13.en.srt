1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,139
(Lawless Lawyer)

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,150
(Lee Joon Gi)

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,980
(Seo Yea Ji)

4
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:17,859
(Lee Hye Young)

5
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,899
(Choi Min Su)

6
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:29,969
(Lawless Lawyer)

7
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:32,899
Who is it that you got...

8
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:34,570
the notebook from?

9
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:38,109
It's Cha Moon Sook.

10
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,280
(Cha Moon Sook, Candidate for
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court)

11
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:47,689
Cha Moon Sook called me
into Kiseong.

12
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:48,689
(The Seven)

13
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:53,960
She's using me to get rid
of her people...

14
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,390
who know her secret.

15
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,000
An Oh Ju.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,530
(An Oh Ju of Ohju Group)

17
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,939
She needed my vengeance
to get rid of him.

18
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,109
Cha Moon Sook knows
about people's desire...

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,840
and how to take advantage
of it better than anyone.

20
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,180
But...

21
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:16,849
Cha Moon Sook is at the end
of your vengeance.

22
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:22,549
Knowing that the point of
my sword is aiming at her,

23
00:01:23,989 --> 00:01:25,319
she chose me.

24
00:01:27,489 --> 00:01:28,590
Cha Moon Sook.

25
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,730
Chief Prosecutor Jang,
how did it go?

26
00:01:33,129 --> 00:01:34,269
An Oh Ju...

27
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,200
is completely doomed.

28
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,250
She made me come to Kiseong...

29
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,519
so that she could
use me as her weapon.

30
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,989
Her enemies...

31
00:01:56,989 --> 00:01:59,260
and those I needed to avenge
overlapped.

32
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:03,090
Cha Moon Sook is one scary lady.

33
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:06,129
However,

34
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:10,469
this time, I saw her cards first.

35
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:13,509
Now, I must use it.

36
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:15,110
That's right, Boss.

37
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,409
Where's Attorney Ha?

38
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,879
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message...

39
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,680
after the tone.

40
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,219
You can't look for her here.

41
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,659
She disappeared 18 years ago.

42
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,330
(Episode 13)

43
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,110
Hey, Attorney Ha Jae I.

44
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,150
Why did you want to see me?

45
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,889
You'd better tell me
where you took my mom to.

46
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:05,460
If you don't, I'll destroy you.

47
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,189
Well...

48
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,729
Your mom died 18 years ago.

49
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,669
Why are you asking me about her?

50
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,870
No, she was alive.

51
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:23,909
The acupressurist who was working
for Cha Moon Sook was my mom.

52
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:29,710
Really? Are you serious?

53
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,789
Then that means...

54
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,020
a poisonous thorn is stuck...

55
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,030
right under
Cha Moon Sook's fingernail.

56
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:44,830
An Oh Ju.

57
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,229
Even you didn't know about it?

58
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,669
Judge Cha and I are enemies now.
Didn't you know?

59
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:52,300
Then find my mom.

60
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,810
I'll represent you in court.

61
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,610
What? What did you just say?

62
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,210
You have no one around you now.

63
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:04,479
You'll hit rock bottom
without my help.

64
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,259
Hold on.

65
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,170
So, Ha Jae I's mom is alive,

66
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,839
and Cha Moon Sook abducted her?

67
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:31,540
Hang on a second.

68
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:39,319
That means the only witness
of the murder from 18 years ago...

69
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:42,220
is still alive.

70
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:45,420
Right?

71
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,029
Hey.

72
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:53,300
What?

73
00:04:54,269 --> 00:04:56,399
I received an appearance notice
from the prosecution?

74
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,339
What are you talking about?

75
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:01,839
Hey, you made it.

76
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,980
Do you already need me,
Bong Sang Pil?

77
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,910
- I need to tell you something.
- Go ahead.

78
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:12,649
Kwon Man Bae betrayed the family.

79
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,620
What did you just say?

80
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,660
I think it started
way before Boss passed away.

81
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,589
I bet...

82
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,629
Cha Moon Sook approached him first.

83
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,300
- Cha Moon Sook?
- Yes.

84
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,569
Some of the guys
who attacked me at the hospital...

85
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,139
were Man Bae's underlings.

86
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,370
Kwon Man Bae?

87
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:38,439
Scorpion,

88
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:40,879
there's something I want to ask you.

89
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:44,379
Why did my uncle send you
to Kiseong?

90
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,379
Dae Woong visited me in prison...

91
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,250
the day before he passed away.

92
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:52,120
He told me
that I'd have to keep you safe...

93
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,459
if anything happened to him.

94
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,259
Then...

95
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,500
what are you going to do now,
Scorpion?

96
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,579
Scorpion.

97
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:15,379
Will you help me?

98
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:30,089
You little...

99
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:35,500
How gutsy of you.
How dare you try to kill her!

100
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:38,740
Are you out of your mind?

101
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,870
You probably don't even see me
as a human being...

102
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,410
because you're used to having
everyone at your feet.

103
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:47,310
Until when do you think
you can mooch off Cha Moon Sook?

104
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:51,250
What? What did you just say?

105
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:53,850
My gosh, you've obviously been...

106
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,389
keeping a lot of resentment
bottled up inside.

107
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:59,319
You witch.
You've completely lost your mind.

108
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:01,829
Gosh, why couldn't I
see through you sooner?

109
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:07,500
Keep a watchful eye
on this woman. Got it?

110
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:33,589
Who sent you?

111
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,089
Please leave if you finished
what you had to do.

112
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:38,160
What? You piece of...

113
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,300
Don't you know who I am?

114
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,970
Who are you?

115
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,910
I know every single person
in this business.

116
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:52,040
Then, you can keep on
without knowing who I am.

117
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,339
What did you say?

118
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:58,149
There's only one person
who can give me orders...

119
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,449
in the entire City of Kiseong.

120
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,889
Is that so?

121
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:09,490
You must be the new thug
who replaced An Oh Ju.

122
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,459
You must be this confident
because you were chosen.

123
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:19,800
You'd better not...

124
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:23,670
call me a thug ever again.

125
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,480
You're scaring me.

126
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,850
Just keep a watchful eye
on that woman.

127
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,860
Welcome, Bong Sang Pil.
I was expecting you.

128
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,370
(Cha Moon Sook)

129
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:51,240
Did you stay late
just to wait for me?

130
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,340
I'm honored.

131
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:59,210
I know that you're connected
to what happened...

132
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,379
to Jae I's mother.

133
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,750
Right, I knew you'd bring it up.

134
00:09:10,289 --> 00:09:12,620
Go tell Jae I.

135
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,330
They should resolve their family
matters within themselves.

136
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:18,700
I clearly told you.

137
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,799
I know everything.

138
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:24,399
Jae I's mother.

139
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,299
Where is she now?

140
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,909
Do you have evidence to prove
that it was my doing?

141
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,480
Then bring it.

142
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:38,149
If I committed a crime, I should
be rightfully punished.

143
00:09:43,419 --> 00:09:45,659
You want me to bring evidence?

144
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,529
Those who are actually innocent
never say that.

145
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:53,429
So, it should be one of these two.

146
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:56,769
You've either gotten rid
of all evidence already...

147
00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:00,710
or have found someone who's willing
to be punished in your place.

148
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:10,679
I'm not sure if you remember, but I
said something to you a while back.

149
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,019
I asked you if you thought
you were the first person...

150
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:18,820
that came here
to speak with me in person.

151
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:22,830
And I said I'd show you
the end of it all.

152
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,330
You must remember that too.

153
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,029
Jae I's mother...

154
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:32,570
will find her way back to Jae I
no matter what.

155
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,409
Of course. She should.

156
00:10:35,409 --> 00:10:36,710
I hope so too.

157
00:10:49,789 --> 00:10:51,789
The other people who came
to speak with you in person...

158
00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:55,190
must've failed
and given up like this,

159
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,799
because they didn't know you
inside out.

160
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,169
Let me ask you one thing too.

161
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:11,710
What is it that you want?

162
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,149
Justice or revenge?

163
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:20,580
A burning sense of justice
won't do you any good.

164
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,450
Just getting your revenge
is more than you can handle.

165
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,870
- Hello, Boss.
- Boss, you're back.

166
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,740
Where's Attorney Ha?

167
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:41,740
She went to the police station
right after meeting An Oh Ju.

168
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,809
She couldn't file a report though.

169
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:44,539
She must be frustrated.

170
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:48,309
- Where is she now?
- She went home.

171
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,350
I should go to her place.

172
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,590
Wait, Boss.
I heard Scorpion got released.

173
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,720
I know.

174
00:11:56,289 --> 00:11:57,789
I met him.

175
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,490
I'll be back in a bit.

176
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,789
- Okay.
- Okay.

177
00:12:03,929 --> 00:12:05,429
- See you.
- See you later, Boss.

178
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:09,769
Who's this Scorpion?

179
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,470
He's number three of Dae Woong Gang.

180
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,539
He's also the one
who stabbed Attorney Bong in prison.

181
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:16,870
I see. What?

182
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,480
Really?

183
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,940
He was loyal to Boss...

184
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,779
just as I'm loyal to Attorney Bong.

185
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,779
So he stabbed Attorney Bong
out of vengeance.

186
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:28,320
- Geum Kang.
- Yes?

187
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,720
If I'm stabbed,
will you get my revenge?

188
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,620
Yes, of course!

189
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:34,090
Right?

190
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,500
An Oh Ju is refusing
to cooperate with the police.

191
00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:42,629
His attitude will be what
strangles him by the neck.

192
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:45,840
Keep stacking up justifiable reasons
for his subpoena...

193
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,809
so that you can serve
his arrest warrant.

194
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,009
Yes, ma'am.

195
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,980
Judge Cha.

196
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,379
Just like you ordered,

197
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,789
I handed over the wench to them.

198
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,490
Ordered?

199
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:06,389
Sorry?

200
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:09,190
You're the one who
hired her in the first place.

201
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:13,159
Even so, I'm not holding you
responsible for doing so.

202
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:17,000
That's right, ma'am.

203
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,500
It's late, so you must be tired.

204
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,440
You should've just called instead.

205
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,440
Anyway, good night.

206
00:13:26,409 --> 00:13:27,950
You too.

207
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:52,500
Did you know already?

208
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,870
That she's my mom?

209
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:56,309
Jae I, I...

210
00:13:56,309 --> 00:13:57,740
Now I don't...

211
00:13:58,509 --> 00:13:59,580
trust you anymore.

212
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:17,860
Leave. I'd rather be alone.

213
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,740
Where were you?
You weren't picking up.

214
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:27,470
I met with An Oh Ju.

215
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:31,409
Jae I...

216
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:39,120
Right now,
there's no person I can't meet,

217
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,049
and there's no place I can't go.

218
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,990
There's nothing else I can do!

219
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:52,000
Please believe me...

220
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,529
and wait a little more.

221
00:14:56,769 --> 00:14:57,940
Just go.

222
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,539
Fine, don't trust me.

223
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,240
(Ha's Photo Studio)

224
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,679
I might actually be
deceiving you anyway.

225
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,620
However, I do worry about you,

226
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,919
and I won't let...

227
00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:52,090
anything bad happen to you.

228
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,860
I'll never stop looking out for you.

229
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,730
At least believe that.

230
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:07,000
(Ha's Photo Studio)

231
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:29,360
Ms. Nam, it's me.

232
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:32,600
I hear you're rarely
in your office as of late.

233
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,399
You never know when
they'll come for me there.

234
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:39,240
Anyway,

235
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,509
there's something I want to ask you.

236
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:43,009
What?

237
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:48,210
It's about
Judge Cha's acupressurist.

238
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,549
How's she doing?

239
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:54,389
Why do you ask?

240
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,320
Are you trying to have her
report back to you?

241
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,620
Are you kidding me?

242
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,929
I don't have time
for that kind of stuff.

243
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:06,059
She's at work right now
massaging Judge Cha.

244
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:08,130
Why?

245
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,900
Ms. Nam,

246
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,940
you and I...

247
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,480
are on the same boat.

248
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,609
Since that's the case,

249
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:26,180
we need to row
in the same direction.

250
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,720
Of course. Have some faith in me.

251
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,960
Like you said, we're a unit.

252
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,759
A unit glued together by money.

253
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,990
- Right. See you then.
- Sure.

254
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,069
The same boat, my foot.

255
00:17:42,369 --> 00:17:45,670
I've checked and yours is
already sinking, you idiot.

256
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,769
Ha Jae I was right.

257
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:54,240
Chief Prosecutor Jang said
that you should soon cooperate.

258
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,049
Everything they're saying
is an outright lie.

259
00:17:57,049 --> 00:18:00,950
There's a recording of you
ordering the hit on someone's life.

260
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,750
That vermin Seok Gwan Dong...

261
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,319
fabricated the voice recording!

262
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,859
Just think about it
from my perspective.

263
00:18:10,329 --> 00:18:13,130
What do I have to gain
by ordering the hit...

264
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:15,000
on the head of a gang?

265
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,029
What are you yelling at me for?

266
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:20,240
Well, it's...

267
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:26,109
Mr. Han, I wasn't
yelling at you, per se.

268
00:18:27,849 --> 00:18:32,349
Please write something in your paper
that makes me look innocent.

269
00:18:32,349 --> 00:18:34,990
We're way past using the media now.

270
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:37,619
It has to go through
the prosecution now.

271
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,759
See you.

272
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,799
Judge Cha is ostracizing Mayor An?

273
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:47,900
That's right.

274
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,299
No matter what he does,
she won't ever take him back.

275
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:53,700
He's doomed.

276
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,710
What about the loyalty
he's shown all these years?

277
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,079
Do you think she'll care about that?

278
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:05,750
She's already replaced him
with another thug.

279
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:10,349
That's why...

280
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:13,289
you need to match her pace.

281
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:16,329
Now's the best time
to arrest An Oh Ju...

282
00:19:16,329 --> 00:19:18,059
and hand him over to her.

283
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,869
How can you be sure
that she's your mother?

284
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:29,509
I've met her a few times
and she's been helping me.

285
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,640
I confirmed it
before she got kidnapped too.

286
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:39,319
Jae I, I'm afraid
this might be quite tough.

287
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,119
Everything's circumstantial.

288
00:19:42,589 --> 00:19:45,059
Also, her officially being
from Thailand...

289
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,619
makes it even harder.

290
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,059
I'm aware...

291
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:50,960
that there's nothing much
you can do.

292
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,259
If she really is Noh Hyun Joo,

293
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,799
I can't sit back and do nothing.

294
00:19:57,099 --> 00:19:59,170
I'll try everything
I can possibly think of.

295
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,200
Thank you, Detective Gong.

296
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,680
Can you not tell
Prosecutor Cheon just yet?

297
00:20:05,779 --> 00:20:08,150
I'll tell him when
I have more evidence.

298
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,680
Sure.

299
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,920
Is there anyone...

300
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:15,190
that you're particularly
suspicious of?

301
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,490
I checked with An Oh Ju,

302
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,859
and he is on the complete outs
with Judge Cha.

303
00:20:20,859 --> 00:20:22,890
That means it can't be his doing.

304
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,529
Then who?

305
00:20:24,529 --> 00:20:27,099
Judge Cha must've
ordered someone else.

306
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,740
This may be a possibility,

307
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:36,240
but there's the man who
stabbed Attorney Bong in prison.

308
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,140
He's called Scorpion,

309
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:41,410
and he was released
from prison recently.

310
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,750
Why do you suspect him?

311
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,119
It's because I heard he was...

312
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,950
still in Kiseong.

313
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:52,619
I'll look into him. Thank you.

314
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:53,619
Sure.

315
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,259
Have a great day.

316
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:12,839
Yes, it's me.

317
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,779
How's Jae I's mother?

318
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:18,920
Don't worry.

319
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,390
She's safe.

320
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:24,089
Her being there is
already a threat to her safety.

321
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:28,160
What's the reason
for going to this length?

322
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:31,900
There's someone...

323
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,529
who can't find out this just yet.

324
00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:36,400
So please...

325
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:53,750
Don't.

326
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,259
This will be
more comfortable for you.

327
00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:06,299
The man with the scorpion tattoo...

328
00:22:06,529 --> 00:22:08,029
will keep you safe.

329
00:22:08,069 --> 00:22:09,470
A scorpion tattoo?

330
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,470
Yes.

331
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,970
I cannot let you
get into a dangerous situation.

332
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:23,349
No, I absolutely cannot tell you
where Scorpion is.

333
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,819
- Mr. Tae.
- Stay away from dangerous places.

334
00:22:25,819 --> 00:22:27,380
If you don't, Sang Pil will kill me.

335
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:29,519
I must meet someone.

336
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,519
Otherwise, I'll go crazy.

337
00:22:31,819 --> 00:22:33,160
I'll go with you, Jae I.

338
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:34,690
Boss.

339
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,359
If you want to meet Scorpion,

340
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,000
I'll come with you.

341
00:22:47,269 --> 00:22:48,640
- Be careful, Kwang Soo.
- All right.

342
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,480
Gosh, those two. What is going on?

343
00:22:52,609 --> 00:22:55,380
Goodness, I really hope things can
go back to how they used to be.

344
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,049
There's so much tension here
these days.

345
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:21,839
Long time no see, Man Bae.

346
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,740
Sang Pil, it's you again?

347
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,839
You couldn't even save
Dae Woong's life.

348
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,349
We have a business to run here.

349
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:33,420
If you, troublemaker lawyers,
walk in and out of here like this,

350
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,019
we'll get no customers.

351
00:23:36,049 --> 00:23:37,619
Where's the guy called Scorpion?

352
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:39,519
Did you abduct my mom?

353
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:40,759
Hey.

354
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,559
I got released from prison
only a little while ago.

355
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,799
Why would we abduct your mom?

356
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:49,730
If you're here to talk nonsense,
get out this instant.

357
00:23:50,269 --> 00:23:51,670
I'm going to ask you one more time.

358
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:55,309
This woman. Did you abduct her?

359
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,640
No, I've never seen
that woman, miss.

360
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,680
Scorpion, please tell us
if there's anything you know.

361
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,009
Hey, Tae Kwang Soo.

362
00:24:03,579 --> 00:24:05,819
You little...
What do you think you're doing now?

363
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:06,819
I'm sorry.

364
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:09,720
Let's go, Jae I.

365
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,490
He won't tell us anything anyway.

366
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:12,660
- Let go.
- Bong Sang Pil.

367
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,859
Do you think
this is your turf or what?

368
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:20,299
- Answer me!
- Enough, okay?

369
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,700
You little...

370
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,069
I said, enough. You jerk.

371
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:25,470
- You piece of...
- Boss, calm down. Please, Boss.

372
00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:30,809
Look at you.
You're all grown up now.

373
00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:33,309
I hope we never cross paths again,
Scorpion.

374
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,579
Get out this instant.

375
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,750
Scorpion.

376
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,119
Where's my mom?

377
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,519
Get out!

378
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,160
Let's go, Jae I.

379
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:48,359
Let go.

380
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:50,829
Let go of me. Let go.

381
00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:51,829
Come on.

382
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,920
Jae I.

383
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:17,549
Follow her. I have to go somewhere.

384
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:18,559
Yes, sir.

385
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,390
Judge Cha Moon Sook,
who forgave Oh Yang Seob,

386
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:27,099
the man who attacked her for
issuing a death penalty for his son,

387
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:29,170
will soon be attending
the hearing...

388
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,799
for her appointment
as Chief Justice.

389
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:33,900
It looks like it'll go through
without any oppositions.

390
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,670
If Judge Cha is appointed as
Chief Justice...

391
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,240
Mr. Kim.

392
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:40,740
Any word from Gwan Dong?

393
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,210
No, he's nowhere to be found.

394
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:45,920
It looks like he left Kiseong
for good.

395
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:55,329
My goodness, Attorney Bong.

396
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:58,160
We'll fall in love at this rate.

397
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,630
Are you stalking me or what?

398
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,970
We don't have that kind
of relationship, you know.

399
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:07,400
Oh, right. Did you know that
Cha Moon Sook's new hound...

400
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:10,309
is strolling around the town
as if the entire city is his?

401
00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:11,369
What?

402
00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:14,809
He's at Ohju Nightclub,
which is just outside the city.

403
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,009
It was your stronghold
back in the days.

404
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:21,890
Did you call me
to give me intel or what?

405
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,890
Of course not.

406
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:28,589
If you want to know more,
go there and find out yourself.

407
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:29,829
Listen.

408
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:33,660
If I go there and find out that
you lied, I'll teach you a lesson.

409
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,700
I'm hanging up.

410
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,700
What?

411
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:41,140
This brat.
How dare he hang up on me?

412
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,109
I guess I'll find out whether he's
lying or not when I go there.

413
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:47,609
You see, what I know is...

414
00:26:48,009 --> 00:26:49,710
wherever Kwon Man Bae is,

415
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,380
we'll find Noh Hyun Joo.

416
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,190
We have to bring her.

417
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,190
Got it, sir.

418
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,519
And...

419
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:02,630
I have to head back to the office
now to pick up something.

420
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,430
You don't need to come with me.

421
00:27:04,829 --> 00:27:09,799
I think that change is
always accompanied by challenges.

422
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,039
If I become the chief justice,

423
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,269
I'll endure all the pain that comes
with ending the old era...

424
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,670
and do my very best
to reform the law of this country...

425
00:27:18,109 --> 00:27:22,049
on the solid foundation of justice.

426
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,779
Cut. That'd be all.
Thank you, Judge Cha.

427
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:28,650
Thank you very much.

428
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:43,130
- Madam Nam.
- Yes, ma'am.

429
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,970
About my borrowed-name accounts...

430
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:48,539
Close them.

431
00:27:49,369 --> 00:27:52,579
All the bank accounts under the
orphans' names. Close all of them.

432
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,839
You'd like to close them?

433
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:55,579
Why all of a sudden...

434
00:27:58,819 --> 00:28:02,150
Is it because of the upcoming
hearing for your appointment?

435
00:28:02,549 --> 00:28:05,720
My gosh, I should've already
thought about that.

436
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,859
You've worked so hard
to manage those accounts for me.

437
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:14,000
Put a few of them under your name...

438
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:16,900
as well as
under Prosecutor Kang's name.

439
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,869
Yeon Hee too?

440
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:27,079
My gosh.

441
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:30,410
Judge Cha, no one cares about me
as much as you do...

442
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:32,779
in this entire world.

443
00:28:38,589 --> 00:28:41,359
I promise you I'll continue
to stay loyal...

444
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,329
and devoted to you.
I'm at your service, ma'am.

445
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:47,430
Good.

446
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,039
Well... What should we do
about the acupressurist?

447
00:28:55,339 --> 00:28:56,539
The acupressurist...

448
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,339
You still don't know
who that woman is?

449
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,150
Who is she?

450
00:29:03,049 --> 00:29:04,250
Mr. Ha's wife.

451
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,049
Jae I's mom.

452
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,150
Sorry?

453
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:12,859
What... How...

454
00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:15,890
Are you talking about that woman
who died...

455
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:17,890
18 years ago?

456
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:21,130
You brought a woman,
who was vying for an opportunity...

457
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:24,970
to stab me in the back,
right to my private residence.

458
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:30,869
Judge Cha.

459
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,609
I'm really sorry.

460
00:29:35,849 --> 00:29:37,910
What a talent you have.

461
00:29:39,349 --> 00:29:41,119
You made a dead woman
come back to life.

462
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:42,319
No, ma'am.

463
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:46,259
I really didn't know
that she was Jae I's mother.

464
00:29:46,859 --> 00:29:47,859
Judge Cha.

465
00:29:48,289 --> 00:29:50,630
I'm telling you the truth.
Please believe me.

466
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:52,730
Judge Cha, please...

467
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,500
Judge Cha.

468
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,099
What's wrong, Mom? What's going on?

469
00:29:59,099 --> 00:30:00,099
Yeon Hee.

470
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:04,670
Judge Cha is giving us...

471
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,640
a ton of money.

472
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,250
What can we do
to repay her kindness?

473
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,880
Just keep doing a good job
of looking after her.

474
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,319
Yes, I know. I should, but...

475
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:20,289
I made a very big mistake.

476
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:22,230
If I can't make up for it...

477
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,329
A mistake?

478
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,829
Because of Jae I's mom...

479
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,569
Jae I's mom?

480
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:30,829
Yeon Hee.

481
00:30:31,569 --> 00:30:32,700
Listen carefully, okay?

482
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,269
You and I...

483
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,240
will have to do anything,
anything that she tells us to do.

484
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,240
Only then, you can be safe.

485
00:30:43,549 --> 00:30:45,420
There's so much money here.

486
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:49,819
How can he leave
all this cash just piled up here?

487
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:53,890
You guys have done nothing wrong.

488
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:58,089
I feel bad that Mayor An has
kept you guys locked up here.

489
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:01,599
Come to me.
I'm your daddy from today.

490
00:31:09,069 --> 00:31:10,369
Seok Gwan Dong.

491
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:16,480
You sneaky rat.

492
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:21,579
I thought you fell off
the face of the earth.

493
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:25,190
Is this where you've been hiding?

494
00:31:26,089 --> 00:31:27,089
Yes?

495
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,759
Mr. Mayor.

496
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,470
Hey,

497
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:37,970
go ahead...

498
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:40,900
and shove that pile of cash
in your mouth.

499
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,410
Sir, please don't kill me.
Please spare my life.

500
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,480
I'm a busy man,

501
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,809
but I do have time to put
a bullet hole through your head.

502
00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:53,920
Please don't kill me.
Please don't kill me, sir!

503
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,950
No, Oh Ju!

504
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:58,420
Oh Ju.

505
00:31:59,059 --> 00:32:00,160
Oh Ju!

506
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:05,299
If you do this,
you'll let Bong Sang Pil beat you.

507
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:07,930
You'll lose.
You'll lose to Bong Sang Pil.

508
00:32:08,329 --> 00:32:10,869
What are you talking about?

509
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:14,970
Bong Sang Pil is keeping
his hands clean...

510
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:17,809
while you cut off
your hands and feet.

511
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,839
By making you kill me,

512
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,779
he will make you a murderer.

513
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:29,220
This is all part of the picture
Bong Sang Pil wants.

514
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:35,990
Save me, boss. Don't kill me.

515
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:38,900
Who is there to serve you?

516
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,430
It's me. Don't you need me
by your side?

517
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:45,200
Just this once.
Forgive me this once.

518
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,069
Forgive me this time
and I'll serve you well.

519
00:32:48,069 --> 00:32:49,839
Are you done talking?

520
00:32:53,579 --> 00:32:55,779
Boss. Boss!

521
00:32:56,009 --> 00:32:57,609
Save me!

522
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:03,190
Stuff your mouth with cash.

523
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,190
I will, boss.

524
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:09,660
Save me. Save me.

525
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:13,160
I don't want to die like this.

526
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,529
I'll stay at your side.

527
00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:18,069
I'll stay with you until the end.

528
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:20,299
I don't want to die like this.

529
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:21,339
Hey.

530
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:27,240
You're like a snake's tongue.
Should I just shoot you?

531
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,279
- Should I?
- Don't kill me!

532
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:31,380
(Courthouse)

533
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,079
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

534
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:35,890
Where are you going?

535
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,559
What did you to with the accounts?

536
00:33:39,789 --> 00:33:41,990
I dealt with them so that...

537
00:33:42,089 --> 00:33:45,599
no borrowed-name accounts exist
that can be connected to you.

538
00:33:46,529 --> 00:33:47,599
Good.

539
00:33:48,029 --> 00:33:50,130
- Let's talk on the way.
- Yes, ma'am.

540
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:54,269
I liquidated everything and
put the case somewhere safe.

541
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,470
You needn't worry about the hearing.

542
00:33:56,769 --> 00:33:59,279
You have nothing to prove
or explain.

543
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,650
The public believes
you will pass with flying colors.

544
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:05,279
We'll have to see to find out.

545
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,079
(Kiseong District Court)

546
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:10,889
I will take you to your destination.

547
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:12,820
No, you needn't today.

548
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:16,329
You did a lot. Go home and rest.

549
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,059
Ma'am.

550
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,869
I will deal with Jae I's mother.

551
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:26,500
Jae I's mother?

552
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:31,210
Didn't she die 18 years ago?

553
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:37,550
Oh. That's right.

554
00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:40,920
You're right, ma'am.
I must've lost my mind.

555
00:34:43,019 --> 00:34:46,019
Ma'am. Know just one thing.

556
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:50,090
I will protect you.

557
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:15,420
Boss, you're ruining your health.

558
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:17,949
You have nowhere to stay.

559
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,090
You care that much about me, do you?

560
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,000
There you are.

561
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:31,469
Did you find out about Kwon Man Bae?

562
00:35:31,469 --> 00:35:33,170
Bong Sang Pil was right.

563
00:35:33,469 --> 00:35:36,469
He's using a nightclub as his base.

564
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,739
Right after I left the fish market,

565
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:46,050
that nightclub was
my first business in town.

566
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,590
You can take it back
after this deal succeeds.

567
00:35:53,889 --> 00:35:56,190
Bong Sang Pil's helping you out.

568
00:35:57,829 --> 00:35:59,329
Boss, no.

569
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,179
How's the masseuse?

570
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:24,949
We're keeping her safe. Don't worry.

571
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,360
Don't keep her safe.

572
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,989
Pardon?

573
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,889
She died 18 years ago.

574
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:35,670
She hid her true identity.
No one will know if she disappears.

575
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:38,500
Get rid of her.

576
00:36:39,769 --> 00:36:42,039
Toss her in the sea
so no one finds her.

577
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:43,710
You want her dead?

578
00:36:44,139 --> 00:36:45,469
Yes.

579
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:49,909
Do you not take me seriously?

580
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:53,550
What I say is what Judge Cha says.

581
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,550
It's Judge Cha's order!

582
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,420
Do you get it?

583
00:36:59,659 --> 00:37:00,719
Yes, ma'am.

584
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:05,030
You should listen to me from now on.

585
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:08,559
This is a warning.

586
00:37:09,969 --> 00:37:12,599
I hope we get along well, ma'am.

587
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:40,860
Okay, thanks, Scorpion.

588
00:37:44,269 --> 00:37:46,440
- Get ready to go out.
- Where to?

589
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,769
Kwang Soo, you have to stay
really sharp from now on.

590
00:37:50,909 --> 00:37:53,179
- Shall I call the boys?
- No.

591
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,280
We can't take too many people.

592
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,750
Then I'm not going either? Okay.

593
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:02,289
- Did you get what I needed?
- It's in the trunk.

594
00:38:02,289 --> 00:38:04,750
- There's no time. Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

595
00:38:04,989 --> 00:38:06,460
- Here.
- Watch the office.

596
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,619
Yes, sir.

597
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,329
Take care.

598
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:15,059
They left me behind
and just won't utilize me.

599
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,300
I'm so talented.

600
00:38:29,449 --> 00:38:30,610
Get rid of her.

601
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,980
Toss her in the sea
so no one finds her.

602
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:35,650
You want her dead?

603
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:37,389
Yes.

604
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:41,119
Do you not take me seriously?

605
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:44,429
What I say is what Judge Cha says.

606
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,260
It's Judge Cha's order!

607
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:48,800
Do you get it?

608
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:54,000
When the tiger leaves the den,
someone else comes out to play.

609
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:57,710
What shall I do with the masseuse?

610
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,210
You should do what
Nam Soon Ja wants.

611
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,610
I'll do it right away.

612
00:39:04,349 --> 00:39:06,280
Watch things go down yourself.

613
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,849
Don't leave it to the underlings.

614
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:10,690
Yes, ma'am.

615
00:39:21,429 --> 00:39:23,800
We'll start when Man Bae arrives.

616
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:51,190
Is this it? Just us three?

617
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:55,429
Nothing in life really lasts.

618
00:39:57,130 --> 00:40:00,599
It was just yesterday
when I controlled...

619
00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:05,239
the fish market and then
the whole of Kiseong.

620
00:40:05,909 --> 00:40:10,610
Who'd have thought
I'd end up like this in just a day?

621
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:16,090
Boss, you aren't dead yet.

622
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:17,250
Cheer up.

623
00:40:17,889 --> 00:40:21,760
You fool. You should just
keep your mouth shut.

624
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,960
Sorry, boss.

625
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,530
Isn't this his club?

626
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:31,369
It's where they're keeping
Jae I's mom.

627
00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:32,670
She's here?

628
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,710
- Yes.
- Then we must get her out.

629
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,340
- No, wait.
- What?

630
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:41,309
- Someone else will come soon.
- Who do you mean?

631
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,780
He should be here by now.

632
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,780
There he is.

633
00:40:51,989 --> 00:40:53,659
Isn't that An Oh Ju?

634
00:40:54,489 --> 00:40:57,989
Boss, how much of this did you plan?

635
00:41:06,469 --> 00:41:08,269
What are you staring at?

636
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:11,710
You should be begging for your life.

637
00:41:11,909 --> 00:41:13,409
Why are you so calm?

638
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:15,340
Aren't you afraid?

639
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,849
- Do it.
- Yes, sir.

640
00:41:31,059 --> 00:41:33,630
Boss, I think you should come over.

641
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:36,030
- What for?
- Mayor An's here.

642
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,670
- You finish up.
- Yes, boss.

643
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:49,650
Look at this. All you fools...

644
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:54,480
Something was happening
in Kiseong...

645
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:58,650
that even the mayor
didn't know about.

646
00:42:00,989 --> 00:42:02,360
Right, Man Bae?

647
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,699
A mayor who lost his teeth
and is on the run is still a mayor?

648
00:42:09,699 --> 00:42:12,869
A rookie shouldn't talk like that
to a seasoned pro.

649
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:19,809
You must think that
Cha Moon Sook has your back.

650
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:25,550
If you do that,
you'll end up helpless like me.

651
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:27,750
So...

652
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:30,650
hand over the woman.

653
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:34,159
Do you think I'll let you...

654
00:42:35,889 --> 00:42:37,690
take over my first mission?

655
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,199
Do you think I'm that weak?

656
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,800
I like your fighting spirit.

657
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:51,510
How are preparations
for your hearing going?

658
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:56,579
The law decides everything
and the people will judge.

659
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:58,750
Right. You don't need to prepare.

660
00:42:59,179 --> 00:43:00,880
You're spotlessly clean.

661
00:43:02,449 --> 00:43:03,550
We at Kiseong...

662
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:08,059
kept you to ourselves for too long.

663
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:10,159
Yes.

664
00:43:10,389 --> 00:43:14,429
I am so relieved
to have you at my side.

665
00:43:17,429 --> 00:43:19,570
- Gwan Dong.
- Yes, boss.

666
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,340
- Look for the woman.
- Yes, boss.

667
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,139
- Secretary Kim, you too.
- Yes, sir.

668
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:31,380
Hey.

669
00:43:34,849 --> 00:43:36,590
- Down.
- Out of my way.

670
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:39,719
You fool.

671
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:40,989
Do you see this?

672
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:46,260
Man Bae.

673
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,869
Can you fight?

674
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,739
Boss, there she is.

675
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:01,139
Get them!

676
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,119
This is just crazy.

677
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:11,849
Darn it.

678
00:44:15,059 --> 00:44:16,159
Stop!

679
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,500
Stop!

680
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:24,730
Stop him!

681
00:44:27,369 --> 00:44:29,099
- Oh no.
- Stop him!

682
00:44:30,139 --> 00:44:31,210
Hey!

683
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:32,809
Boss.

684
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:34,880
What now?

685
00:44:35,179 --> 00:44:37,949
That was our only way out.

686
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,949
Oh dear. A card we could've used...

687
00:44:41,949 --> 00:44:43,489
just sank into the sea.

688
00:44:43,949 --> 00:44:45,090
See you around.

689
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:47,619
Sure, sure.

690
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:50,190
Boys!

691
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:01,400
Gwan Dong.

692
00:45:01,769 --> 00:45:02,940
Yes, boss?

693
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:04,510
- Secretary Kim.
- Yes?

694
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:05,670
Let's go.

695
00:45:23,989 --> 00:45:25,590
An Oh Ju refused to appear.

696
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:28,030
We'll execute
an arrest warrant tomorrow.

697
00:45:28,329 --> 00:45:30,300
He committed a crime.
It's only right.

698
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:31,900
He should be punished.

699
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,300
You favored him...

700
00:45:33,539 --> 00:45:35,539
more than he ever deserved.

701
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,239
He should pay up.

702
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,610
Isn't that how the world works?

703
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:42,210
That is justice.

704
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,219
You can go now, chief prosecutor.

705
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:49,920
Yes, ma'am.

706
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:02,929
How did it go?

707
00:46:04,199 --> 00:46:05,900
An Oh Ju was here.

708
00:46:06,739 --> 00:46:08,039
An Oh Ju?

709
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:09,969
It almost went wrong,

710
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:11,639
but we got it done.

711
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:13,480
Good.

712
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:17,179
I'll change my number.
Don't ever call it again.

713
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,610
You should move to Seoul.

714
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:20,719
Yes, ma'am.

715
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:37,699
You can sit up now.

716
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:50,780
Now...

717
00:46:51,409 --> 00:46:53,679
I'll tell you
the most important bit.

718
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,590
You're the only witness
of the murder...

719
00:46:57,590 --> 00:46:59,349
Cha Moon Sook committed
18 years ago.

720
00:47:00,619 --> 00:47:01,860
You will die again.

721
00:47:03,329 --> 00:47:05,329
Cha Moon Sook
won't end it with an abduction.

722
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:08,630
She'll choose a way out with which
she can bury Nam Soon Ja with.

723
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:10,929
You must die...

724
00:47:11,869 --> 00:47:14,869
so she can hide her past completely.

725
00:47:16,969 --> 00:47:20,139
No one knows that Cha Moon Sook
has such a weakness.

726
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:21,909
I will use that.

727
00:47:22,809 --> 00:47:23,849
Then...

728
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:24,980
I will...

729
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,519
set the stage for your death.

730
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:32,250
But...

731
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,789
I wish that you'd rather
back out now.

732
00:47:36,829 --> 00:47:37,889
I must...

733
00:47:39,329 --> 00:47:40,800
go all the way.

734
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:45,400
You must be careful, ma'am.

735
00:47:57,610 --> 00:47:58,610
Ma'am.

736
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:07,119
Come with me.

737
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:31,679
What will you do now?

738
00:48:33,449 --> 00:48:34,550
Don't you smell it?

739
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:36,750
Smell what?

740
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:39,050
This fishy smell.

741
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,989
This reeks of Bong Sang Pil.

742
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:48,630
Did we just get played again?

743
00:48:58,570 --> 00:48:59,679
Jae I.

744
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,809
I'm coming over with your mother.

745
00:49:03,449 --> 00:49:04,909
Come to the address I'll text you.

746
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:08,150
- My mom?
- Yes.

747
00:49:09,219 --> 00:49:11,250
Wait just a bit, Jae I.

748
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:13,590
Bong Sang Pil.

749
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:16,219
Is this true?

750
00:49:24,369 --> 00:49:27,599
Thank you, Attorney Bong.

751
00:50:21,659 --> 00:50:22,860
Jae I.

752
00:50:31,329 --> 00:50:32,429
Mom.

753
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:40,309
I finally got to say it to you.

754
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,929
I missed you so much.

755
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:07,940
Attorney Ha.
Is she going to be all right?

756
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:17,510
I asked Attorney Bong Sang Pil...

757
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:20,750
not to tell you about me.

758
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:23,690
And...

759
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:26,489
I asked him to leave you.

760
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:30,960
I thought that was the only way.

761
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:37,199
I couldn't stand
that you were planning...

762
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:40,599
a dangerous revenge with him.

763
00:51:41,769 --> 00:51:42,969
I'm sorry, Jae I.

764
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:45,769
And I feel bad
for Attorney Bong Sang Pil.

765
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:56,650
Mom.

766
00:51:57,719 --> 00:51:58,889
It's all right.

767
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:01,820
I'm sorry.

768
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,130
Attorney Bong,
I have something to tell you.

769
00:52:06,699 --> 00:52:08,059
I'm very disappointed.

770
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:10,130
I didn't know you'd
deceive us like that.

771
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:12,969
Hey, he didn't deceive you.

772
00:52:12,969 --> 00:52:16,739
You haven't done anything
important in your life.

773
00:52:16,739 --> 00:52:20,440
You'll never understand
how he feels.

774
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:22,139
Am I right, Attorney Bong?

775
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:26,409
I had to keep it
to myself this time.

776
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:27,579
I had no choice.

777
00:52:28,179 --> 00:52:31,590
I knew something was going on but
didn't know it was this big.

778
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,559
You're the best.

779
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:37,090
- Attorney Ha.
- Hey.

780
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:40,900
Sang Pil.

781
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,070
- Jae I.
- Sang Pil.

782
00:52:44,869 --> 00:52:46,230
What's wrong?

783
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:48,369
You've completely fooled me.

784
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:51,539
- Jae I.
- Bong Sang Pil!

785
00:52:52,539 --> 00:52:54,210
Gosh, stop her.

786
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:55,380
Get off me!

787
00:52:56,309 --> 00:52:57,650
Wait. I'm sorry.

788
00:52:59,579 --> 00:53:00,650
Jae I.

789
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,179
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

790
00:53:03,849 --> 00:53:06,760
Sang Pil, I need to talk to you.

791
00:53:13,699 --> 00:53:16,260
Make yourselves comfortable
and do your jobs.

792
00:53:16,329 --> 00:53:17,630
Okay.

793
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:19,199
What if they have a big fight?

794
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:22,039
I know. What should we do?

795
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:26,239
Jae I.

796
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:42,590
Thank you for helping
my mom come back, Sang Pil.

797
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,130
I'm sorry, Jae I.

798
00:53:56,809 --> 00:53:57,809
Too bad.

799
00:53:58,139 --> 00:54:02,340
There's no room
left for you between them.

800
00:54:03,909 --> 00:54:07,880
You're getting me all riled up
in a whole new way.

801
00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:09,150
I know that.

802
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:12,590
I'll never have an attorney
brother-in-law in my life.

803
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:14,460
Don't worry.

804
00:54:14,789 --> 00:54:16,690
I'll never let you die alone.

805
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:18,730
Mind your own business.

806
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:21,960
As a woman,

807
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,400
I'll succeed in my career.

808
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,829
With my lawless sword.

809
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:28,039
That's so cool.

810
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,869
I forgot that you were a woman.

811
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:32,309
Hey!

812
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:40,550
I'll carry them.

813
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:41,880
- Thank you.
- No problem.

814
00:54:43,489 --> 00:54:46,690
Don't worry.
I'll see you again soon.

815
00:54:47,389 --> 00:54:51,130
I know.
Sang Pil will take care of it.

816
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:01,599
Choi Dae Woong told me this.

817
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:06,269
That you're fighting against
the enemies who're too big for you.

818
00:55:07,239 --> 00:55:08,909
It's like bringing a knife
to a gunfight.

819
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:12,650
And that even if you
sacrifice yourself,

820
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:16,750
you will make a small hole
with the knife.

821
00:55:18,789 --> 00:55:21,059
With the small hole,

822
00:55:22,659 --> 00:55:24,530
you'll win the gun battle.

823
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:29,829
That was his last words.

824
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:33,800
I felt the same way.

825
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:37,940
To protect the knife,

826
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:41,039
I would do anything.

827
00:55:44,409 --> 00:55:46,679
Boss, I'm afraid we should go.

828
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:49,750
Okay.

829
00:55:51,949 --> 00:55:52,949
You may leave now.

830
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:55,719
Scorpion will take good care of you.

831
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:56,929
Thank you.

832
00:55:58,289 --> 00:55:59,289
Attorney Bong.

833
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:15,679
Please take good care of Jae I.

834
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:19,309
Okay. Don't worry about her.

835
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:49,579
It's Cha Moon Sook...

836
00:56:50,309 --> 00:56:51,550
who sent you the notebook?

837
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:53,250
Yes.

838
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:57,489
Cha Moon Sook has had
this plan to use me...

839
00:56:57,690 --> 00:57:00,489
to get rid of The Seven
who know her ugly past.

840
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:02,659
Since she'd sent me the notebook.

841
00:57:03,489 --> 00:57:05,929
She joined hands with
the representative of the party...

842
00:57:05,929 --> 00:57:07,829
and drew in real life gangsters.

843
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:12,570
She tried to cover up the past
and make up a new future.

844
00:57:12,969 --> 00:57:14,070
Cha Moon Sook.

845
00:57:14,670 --> 00:57:15,670
Now...

846
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:20,440
we will have a showdown
with Cha Moon Sook.

847
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:31,389
(Judge Cha Moon Sook)

848
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:57,679
(Mayor of Kiseong, An Oh Ju)

849
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:14,699
I didn't know we had this.

850
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:15,829
This is amazing.

851
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:21,869
Cha Moon Sook would think her plans
are going without a hitch by now.

852
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:23,239
What's next?

853
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:24,369
It's simple.

854
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:27,179
We'll pretend to dance to her tune.

855
00:58:27,179 --> 00:58:29,639
I can dance well.

856
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:31,349
So what's her tune?

857
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:36,280
That's too old-fashioned. Stop it.

858
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,190
Why? It sounds cool.

859
00:58:38,289 --> 00:58:40,889
The big picture begins now.

860
00:58:41,159 --> 00:58:43,730
I just cast a big net to catch them.

861
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:47,199
We will have to pick up fish
caught in the net carefully.

862
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,329
Without losing a single fish.

863
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,530
When there's a lot of fish
in the net,

864
00:58:51,969 --> 00:58:55,300
there must be one
struggling to get out.

865
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,139
Don't you think it would be easiest
to pick that one up first?

866
00:58:58,210 --> 00:58:59,769
Sure. Good.

867
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:05,909
Which one will
struggle most desperately...

868
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:07,480
to get out of the net first?

869
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:08,820
Nam Soon Ja.

870
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:10,449
Don't you think?

871
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:12,420
Jae I, bingo.

872
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:19,989
Prosecutor Kang, have a good day.

873
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:22,199
Teach bad guys good lessons.

874
00:59:22,429 --> 00:59:23,730
Have a good day.

875
00:59:34,179 --> 00:59:35,710
Ms. Nam Soon Ja, step out.

876
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:37,380
What do you think you're doing?

877
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:39,050
We got a tip-off with a video.

878
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,849
A video of your mother.

879
00:59:41,849 --> 00:59:43,989
What? A video?

880
00:59:43,989 --> 00:59:44,989
Step out of the car.

881
00:59:45,389 --> 00:59:47,719
- Detective Gong, what is happening?
- Wait a moment.

882
00:59:48,389 --> 00:59:49,619
What is going on?

883
00:59:50,659 --> 00:59:52,630
What do you think you're doing?

884
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:56,760
My daughter, Prosecutor Kang,
is right here witnessing everything!

885
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:58,800
Ms. Nam Soon Ja,

886
00:59:59,469 --> 01:00:02,000
you're under arrest for
the kidnapping, confinement,

887
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,510
and conspiracy to commit murder.

888
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:07,039
What? Conspiracy to commit murder?

889
01:00:07,639 --> 01:00:09,539
- Detective...
- You have the right to an attorney.

890
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:11,079
- Yeon Hee...
- Let go of her!

891
01:00:11,079 --> 01:00:12,210
Don't you dare!

892
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:13,510
- What is this?
- Take her!

893
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:14,780
- Mom!
- Let go of me!

894
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:16,349
You're making a huge mistake!

895
01:00:16,349 --> 01:00:18,489
Let go. Let go of me!

896
01:00:18,619 --> 01:00:19,750
Take her!

897
01:00:19,789 --> 01:00:21,619
- Yeon Hee, Yeon Hee!
- Mom.

898
01:00:21,619 --> 01:00:23,789
- Yeon Hee...
- Mom!

899
01:00:23,789 --> 01:00:25,329
Yeon Hee!

900
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:28,860
- Let's head out.
- Yes, sir.

901
01:00:36,869 --> 01:00:38,809
Yes, Mr. Han.

902
01:00:38,809 --> 01:00:39,869
Mayor An,

903
01:00:40,539 --> 01:00:42,280
a warrant for your arrest
has been issued.

904
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:45,809
- What did you just say?
- Ms. Nam was just arrested.

905
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:48,250
Chief Prosecutor Jang told me.

906
01:00:51,449 --> 01:00:52,449
All right.

907
01:00:55,719 --> 01:00:57,630
Mayor An Oh Ju
is still off the grid.

908
01:00:57,889 --> 01:00:59,059
- Really?
- Yes.

909
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:05,500
Sir, An Oh Ju is on the run.

910
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:09,300
We'll put out a BOLO
and trace his vehicle.

911
01:01:10,139 --> 01:01:12,940
You're coming at me...

912
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:14,739
with the law,

913
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:18,010
so what can I do?

914
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:20,949
Bong Sang Pil and Cha Moon Sook,

915
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:23,480
it's not over until it's over.

916
01:01:24,719 --> 01:01:25,750
Gwan Dong,

917
01:01:27,090 --> 01:01:28,420
start the car.

918
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:30,320
Yes, Mr. Mayor.

919
01:01:30,929 --> 01:01:31,929
I mean, Boss.

920
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:35,800
The current mayor and his aide...

921
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,099
are both being hunted
by the police...

922
01:01:38,099 --> 01:01:40,570
which is an unprecedented event.

923
01:01:41,269 --> 01:01:43,440
Mayor An is suspected
of conspiracy to commit murder...

924
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:44,840
as well as a violation
of election law.

925
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:47,780
His aide Seok Gwan Dong
is a suspect of murder.

926
01:01:47,909 --> 01:01:50,480
The prosecution already
had condemning evidence...

927
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,579
and has been building
a case against them.

928
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:54,920
Moving on.

929
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:57,349
An unemployed woman in her 50s...

930
01:01:57,349 --> 01:01:59,719
has been arrested by
the police for the murder...

931
01:01:59,719 --> 01:02:01,590
of a Thai acupressurist.

932
01:02:01,690 --> 01:02:03,190
For 35 years, in Kiseong,

933
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:05,889
she has been
collection commission...

934
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:08,659
for her services as a broker.

935
01:02:08,659 --> 01:02:12,530
She's also said to be complicit
in many illegal activities.

936
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,409
This notebook you sent me.

937
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:28,119
I've been having a blast with it.

938
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:30,690
You didn't write the ending though.

939
01:02:34,889 --> 01:02:35,920
And what may that be?

940
01:02:37,059 --> 01:02:38,829
The end of Cha Moon Sook.

941
01:02:41,659 --> 01:02:42,659
Right.

942
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,699
Try your best
writing that final chapter.

943
01:02:45,329 --> 01:02:47,070
I'm curious of it too.

944
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:51,840
You took Jae I's mother
away from Jae I twice.

945
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:56,409
I'll never forgive you for that.

946
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:09,460
I had nothing to do with that.

947
01:03:10,389 --> 01:03:11,429
Also,

948
01:03:11,429 --> 01:03:13,960
is the Thai acupressurist
really her mother?

949
01:03:14,059 --> 01:03:15,099
Where's the proof?

950
01:03:18,269 --> 01:03:19,500
I didn't expect...

951
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:23,500
to hear you spill
all the answers anyway.

952
01:03:27,579 --> 01:03:29,980
I admit that
there's something I didn't count...

953
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:34,320
when sending you that notebook.

954
01:03:38,119 --> 01:03:40,989
You and Jae I getting together.

955
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:46,090
Your relationship with her
is what will bog you down.

956
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:48,960
Don't you think
it could be the opposite?

957
01:03:51,769 --> 01:03:55,269
It'll be the biggest flaw
in your elaborate plan.

958
01:03:57,409 --> 01:04:00,039
You not anticipating
our relationship.

959
01:04:21,429 --> 01:04:23,130
(Lawless Lawyer)

960
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:26,400
I'm finally going to untie the knot
that's been stuck for 18 years.

961
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,900
I'll bring you down
with whatever I have.

962
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:31,070
The judge of Kiseong is me.

963
01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:33,239
You're trying to break
a rock with eggs.

964
01:04:33,239 --> 01:04:36,440
Just you wait and see
for the rock will be cracked soon.

965
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:39,550
She's signaling you that she
has proof of Judge Cha's corruption.

966
01:04:39,550 --> 01:04:42,880
Starting today, I'll be officially
defending Ms. Nam Soon Ja.

967
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:47,389
There's only one thing that can
stop Bong Sang Pil.

968
01:04:47,519 --> 01:04:48,590
It's Ha Jae I.

969
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:50,219
An Oh Ju!
