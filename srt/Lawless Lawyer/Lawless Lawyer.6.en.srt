(Noh Hyun Joo)

8
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:46,219
Why are pictures of
my mom and me up here?

9
00:00:49,689 --> 00:00:50,689
Tell me.

10
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:55,289
The true reason
you came to Kiseong.

11
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,599
An Oh Ju murdered my mother...

12
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,209
in front of my eyes
in this very office.

13
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:16,920
An Oh Ju ordered Cha Moon Sook...

14
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,650
to kill my mom.

15
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:22,750
What?

16
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,019
Also, what happened to me
and your mother going missing...

17
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,930
were the aftermaths of her orders.

18
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:37,000
All these photos...

19
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,439
were taken by your mother.

20
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,250
Mom, look at me.

21
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,120
- Like this?
- No.

22
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,120
- Like this?
- No.

23
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,189
All right. I got it.

24
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:55,189
Are you done?

25
00:01:58,459 --> 00:01:59,560
Cheese.

(Episode 6)

27
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,919
What happened to me
and your mother going missing...

28
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:03,919
were the aftermaths of her orders.

29
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:43,659
Jae I, when will you be home?
Let's have dinner together.

30
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,430
- Dad.
- Yes?

31
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:55,310
The thing is...

32
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:03,509
Mom...

33
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,879
Mom was...

34
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,650
Your mom?

35
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:10,759
What about her?

36
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:18,399
It's nothing.

37
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:22,500
Dad, go ahead and have dinner
without me.

38
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,009
Who sent this?

39
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:12,079
I'm just a delivery guy,
so I don't know.

40
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,850
Are you saying you're moving
to Kiseong because of this notebook?

41
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,089
Not just because of that.

42
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,819
Then is it because of that girl?

43
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,129
- Yes, Boss.
- Who gave you that notebook?

44
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:31,829
From what I know, there's only
one person who'd send this to me.

45
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,569
Ha Jae I.

46
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,839
I want you to know the truth
about everything,

47
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:46,279
but at the same time,
I hope you never find out.

48
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:49,079
That's how I honestly feel.

49
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:57,819
(Daeho Stationary)

50
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,269
I introduced the hitman
to someone for a fee.

51
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,600
That someone...

52
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,610
is the secretary.

53
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:50,310
Whose secretary
are you talking about?

54
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,910
Chairman An Oh Ju.

55
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:55,850
So he's gone off the grid.

56
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,649
I wonder who gave him
the information.

57
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,649
Someone must've told him.

58
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:02,949
Otherwise, he wouldn't have been
able to run away so quickly.

59
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,620
Did you want to see me,
Prosecutor Kang?

60
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,160
There is a rumor that someone...

61
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,129
might be leaking confidential
information about our cases.

62
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:18,939
That's impossible.

63
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,470
It's just a groundless rumor.

64
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:23,709
Why haven't we been able to
track down Chairman An's secretary?

65
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:26,509
That's because he fled before
we got the arrest warrant issued...

66
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:29,750
And you're saying that
it's just a groundless rumor?

67
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,850
I'll make sure
data security is tightened.

68
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,279
Make sure to arrest him.

69
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,019
He's one of the main suspects.

70
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:36,720
With all due respect,

71
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,690
if people think Wu Hyung Man is not
guilty, we might lose the trial...

72
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:41,960
Lose the trial?

73
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,659
We can talk about that
after we catch the suspect.

74
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,029
You can leave.

75
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:00,779
(Approval Ratings of Mayoral
Candidates, An Oh Ju 42.3 percent)

76
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,419
Chairman An.

77
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,059
I got the ball rolling for you.
What is this now?

78
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:12,059
His rating was...

79
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:14,629
probably hurt by how his secretary
was mentioned at the trial.

80
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,730
He'll lose the election
at this rate.

81
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,200
About that trial...

82
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,370
There wasn't a single article
about it.

83
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:26,200
Don't jump to your own conclusions.

84
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,139
Sure, you have a grip on the media,
but your rating isn't going up.

85
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:30,840
What have you been doing, Ms. Nam?

86
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:34,049
He should be able to get elected
with his abilities alone.

87
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:38,519
I don't want to partake
in this election campaign.

88
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:44,320
I just told you to help Chairman An.

89
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,019
Did you not understand that?

90
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,860
Right, I'm sorry.

91
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:55,870
How dare you talk back to Judge Cha?

92
00:09:56,669 --> 00:10:00,370
Don't make your own decisions.
Just don't.

93
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,409
We're not here
to make decisions, you know.

94
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,980
Aren't I right?

95
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,309
You made me look like a jerk
in front of her.

96
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,649
I guess you're all distracted
by the election,

97
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,450
but you should worry
about the trial.

98
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:20,389
Well, Prosecutor Kang Yeon Hee...

99
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:23,929
is your daughter.
Why should I be worried?

100
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:25,399
What did you just say?

101
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,259
You got your daughter's back,

102
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:31,570
so she'll push through.
It'll be so lovely,

103
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,509
just like what Judge Cha said.

104
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:35,840
An Oh Ju!

105
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,909
What?

106
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,779
Don't you dare
talk about my daughter...

107
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,850
with that dirty mouth of yours.

108
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,549
My gosh, I'm so scared.

109
00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:49,350
She didn't become a prosecutor...

110
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,820
to clean up after scums like you.

111
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:52,860
You got that?

112
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:57,730
Don't ever forget.

113
00:10:58,299 --> 00:10:59,529
Prosecutor Kang...

114
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:03,870
can definitely send you back
to the gutters.

115
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:05,669
Sure, sure.

116
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,009
Bye.

117
00:11:18,049 --> 00:11:19,120
Boss.

118
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,720
Did you get no sleep at all?

119
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:25,659
I couldn't fall asleep.

120
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,990
You'll ruin your health.

121
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:31,730
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes, Boss.

122
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:36,570
I told Ms. Ha everything.

123
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:40,669
I see.

124
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,039
Except for...

125
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:47,179
the most important thing.

126
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,059
(After That, Noh Hyun Joo)

(The Golden City)

128
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:34,889
Hey.

129
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:39,019
Do you know...

130
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,529
how I built Ohju Group?

131
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,259
Didn't you start with
Ohju Construction?

132
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:45,830
You know.

133
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:49,269
All the stinking factory sites...

134
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,039
and landfills full of dog poop.

135
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,210
I bought them all up...

136
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,070
and built apartments.

137
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,009
Land that no one would pee on,

138
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,980
I turned into land
worth paying gold for.

139
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:07,179
Is that why you're planning
The Golden City?

140
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,950
Yes, so...

141
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,019
that's why I must win this election.

142
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,789
Let's move onto the next step.

143
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,360
Ohju Group.

144
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,399
Announce that it'll be...

145
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,269
transferred to a blind trust.

146
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:29,309
Sorry, sir, but what's
a blind trust?

147
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:31,840
I've heard of blank checks but...

148
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,580
You ignorant fool.

149
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,519
I'm saying I'll give up the company.

150
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,389
Will you really, boss?

151
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,289
You should read some books.

152
00:14:47,629 --> 00:14:51,299
Hello, I'm An Oh Ju.

153
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:54,330
Isn't it tough to make a living?

154
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:59,470
If you promise to elect me mayor,

155
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,070
Kiseong's dream.

156
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:07,340
The goal that we
worked towards for 18 years.

157
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:10,279
I will push ahead with...

158
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,320
The Golden City.

159
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,919
I'll make it happen
at the speed of light.

160
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:17,990
- An Oh Ju!
- An Oh Ju!

161
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,990
- Please vote for me.
- An Oh Ju!

162
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:22,789
Your brave decision and vote...

163
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:26,230
for the future of Kiseong.

164
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,769
We need this desperately.

165
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:34,139
Please give me
your love and support!

166
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:40,110
Where were you?

167
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:43,379
I just needed some air.

168
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:49,549
Then do you...

169
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:51,389
believe me now?

170
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:54,190
I have to.

171
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,129
What's that look?

172
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:05,039
Hearing that you believe me
makes me think...

173
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,509
I accomplished something huge.

174
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,850
Did you come to Kiseong for revenge?

175
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,610
Yes.

176
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:19,350
And...

177
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:23,320
to tell you the truth.

178
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,789
Why did you become an attorney?

179
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:31,799
Was it because of your mom?

180
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,070
That should be it.

181
00:16:35,669 --> 00:16:37,700
Because she was a good attorney.

182
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,600
Was there any other reason?

183
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,340
Not before.

184
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,879
Not until now.

185
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:51,950
How did you...

186
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,450
find out about my mom?

187
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,700
The day I was kidnapped,

188
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,670
she saved me.

189
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,670
Then...

190
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:17,940
what about her?

191
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,220
You don't need to answer.

192
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,490
I'll hear it myself.

193
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:34,529
(Improved morality)

194
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:41,700
I came because I heard
you came alone.

195
00:17:44,069 --> 00:17:46,740
Thanks for persuading Mr. Hwang.

196
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:50,509
From here on,

197
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,309
I'll fend for myself.

198
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:55,480
18 years ago, you kidnapped him.

199
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:57,680
Bong Sang Pil.

200
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,150
What?

201
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:02,019
If he didn't get away,
would you have killed him?

202
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:05,220
What are you talking about?

203
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:07,460
He was 10 years old then.

204
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,500
And his mom died in front of him.

205
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,799
You people...

206
00:18:18,369 --> 00:18:19,539
took that kid...

207
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,309
The woman you'd abducted with him.

208
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,349
What did you do to her?

209
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:41,829
Answer me.

210
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:50,900
Did you kill her?

211
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,640
What do you care
if I killed her or not?

212
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,509
Because that woman was my mom.

213
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,680
She was your mom?

214
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:06,619
Answer me.

215
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,789
What did you do to her?

216
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:15,829
Where is she?

217
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,859
Is she alive?

218
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,869
You... You're her daughter?

219
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:24,900
Answer me!

220
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,740
Are you really...

221
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:33,880
Is she alive?

222
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,309
I'm sorry.

223
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,950
I'm sorry.

224
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,730
I can't forgive you.

225
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:39,039
You should report if you work late.

226
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,349
Why are you so late?

227
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:05,769
Can you...

228
00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:09,740
stay like this for just a while?

229
00:21:43,109 --> 00:21:44,170
Did you...

230
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,779
live like this for 18 years?

231
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,049
Because there was...

232
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,819
something I had to do.

233
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:07,059
From now on,

234
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:11,130
it will get worse...

235
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:13,299
Ha Jae I.

236
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:17,369
I know that.

237
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,569
Who are you?

238
00:23:54,569 --> 00:23:56,309
I could ask you the same thing.

239
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,380
I'm...

240
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,109
The door's open.
Is someone here already?

241
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:03,579
What on earth are you doing here?

242
00:24:03,579 --> 00:24:04,650
This is my workplace!

243
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,519
I said I'd pay you back, didn't I?

244
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:08,619
Ms. Ha?

245
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,450
- I see you're at work early.
- Yes, I am.

246
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,559
Oh, that's coffee.

247
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:16,589
You must've worked late. Am I right?

248
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:19,329
Yes, working late hours has...

249
00:24:19,329 --> 00:24:20,559
made me all stiff.

250
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,799
You must be exhausted,
so we should talk at home.

251
00:24:23,869 --> 00:24:27,670
You know what happens
if you take my money and bounce.

252
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:30,869
I'm Geum Ja,
also known as the Hook of Kiseong.

253
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:33,140
I could hook you
by the nostrils right now.

254
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,539
You can't do this
to your own brother.

255
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:38,079
When it comes to money,
blood doesn't really count.

256
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,079
May I ask who this is?

257
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:44,960
I'm here to collect
my big brother's debt.

258
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:48,730
- Look this way. 1, 2, 3.
- What?

259
00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:53,859
Let me see. 358 dollars?

260
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,500
That's a luxury item
for someone in debt.

261
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,970
- I'm confiscating that.
- You can't.

262
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:02,109
She's the perfect
kind of loan shark.

263
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,710
Hook of Kiseong, did you say?

264
00:25:19,289 --> 00:25:22,329
My dream is to rake in
all the money...

265
00:25:22,329 --> 00:25:24,960
Kiseong has to offer.

266
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,430
Pay your respects to Attorney Bong.

267
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,599
Attorney? Are you an attorney?

268
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:32,339
So you have a younger sister.
I didn't know that.

269
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,269
It's nice to meet you.

270
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,539
Geum means "gold"
and Ja means "son".

271
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:39,480
I should've been born
as the son of gold,

272
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,750
but I came out as a girl instead.

273
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,950
If you're done, we should head home.

274
00:25:44,579 --> 00:25:47,619
- Hurry up.
- Don't you need extra hands here?

275
00:25:47,619 --> 00:25:48,650
We don't.

276
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:51,619
If that's the case,
why don't you quit?

277
00:25:51,619 --> 00:25:52,920
I can take your spot.

278
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,359
- You're being absurd.
- Gosh.

279
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:56,390
Hold it.

280
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,400
Excuse me,

281
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,670
but what's your relationship to him?

282
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:05,140
Well...

283
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,400
They're only colleagues.

284
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,470
- We're out of here.
- Hey.

285
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:11,109
- You should take that off quickly!
- I'm so sorry.

286
00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:12,309
You little girl!

287
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,549
Take that off quickly!

288
00:26:56,789 --> 00:26:57,819
Here you go.

289
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,960
Thanks.

290
00:27:09,369 --> 00:27:11,230
When will you tell your father?

291
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:15,109
I should probably tell him...

292
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,210
although he'll be shocked.

293
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:19,710
Will you be all right...

294
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:22,650
if Wu Hyung Man goes free?

295
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:27,220
He didn't kill Mayor Lee Young Soo,
so he should go free.

296
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:31,549
Of course. We're lawyers after all.

297
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:36,289
I'll make him pay for
what he did though.

298
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:37,690
For sure.

299
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,380
Thank you so much.
Have you eaten, sir?

300
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,079
- Please stay seated.
- Okay.

301
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:00,220
Excuse me.

302
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,519
Please stay seated.

303
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:05,819
Hey.

304
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,789
Wu Hyung Man?

305
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:11,529
I thought about your offer.

306
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,730
Really?

307
00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:15,599
You make decisions fast...

308
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:17,369
which is why I like you.

309
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,400
It's why I think highly of you.

310
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,809
Come now.

311
00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:25,940
(Quiet Indoors)

312
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,079
You made the right choice.

313
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:35,920
The answer's pretty clear,
so what's the point in...

314
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,250
crunching the numbers?

315
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,319
Don't you get why
I asked you to come here?

316
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:40,460
Of course.

317
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:43,559
You don't have to tell me
for me to know.

318
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:45,329
Give me your phone.

319
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,670
- My phone?
- You're not allowed to bring it in,

320
00:28:51,869 --> 00:28:55,339
but no one in Kiseong
can stop you, can they?

321
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:58,269
Attorney Go,

322
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:01,440
hand him your phone.

323
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:21,799
Bong Sang Pil, it's me.

324
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:24,069
This isn't the prison's number.

325
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:26,400
Did you break yourself free?

326
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:30,069
An Oh Ju is sitting across from me.

327
00:29:32,109 --> 00:29:33,579
What do you think you're doing?

328
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,710
Aren't you curious
of his intentions?

329
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,079
Listen to me carefully.

330
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:43,950
He showed me a video...

331
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,559
and told me
he'd get me out of here.

332
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:48,890
Can you...

333
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:52,660
win the trial without this video
as evidence?

334
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:57,799
Yes, I'm going to
get you out of there.

335
00:29:58,299 --> 00:29:59,339
Really?

336
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:02,369
That's what I wanted to hear.

337
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:04,710
That way, I can...

338
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,240
tell An Oh Ju this.

339
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:12,420
Get lost, you worthless thug.

340
00:30:12,619 --> 00:30:13,819
Goodness.

341
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:18,960
Do you think you'll be able
to make it out alive?

342
00:30:20,589 --> 00:30:24,029
I don't think we'll be
seeing each other again,

343
00:30:25,529 --> 00:30:27,730
so let me ask you this.

344
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:32,339
Why are you hammering
the nails on your own coffin?

345
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,640
Why?

346
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,039
A detective is someone...

347
00:30:38,109 --> 00:30:41,680
that puts thugs like you
behind bars.

348
00:30:44,349 --> 00:30:47,349
I forgot about that
for quite a while,

349
00:30:48,049 --> 00:30:49,990
but now it has come back to me.

350
00:30:54,859 --> 00:30:55,990
You!

351
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:59,799
Since when were you
ever an honorable cop?

352
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,400
I guess your visit persuaded him.

353
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:04,900
Was that Wu Hyung Man?

354
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,069
Yes.

355
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:12,140
Wu Hyung Man is innocent
but evidence on him is sufficient.

356
00:31:13,109 --> 00:31:14,380
What does that mean?

357
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:18,980
It means that the evidence
was fabricated.

358
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:20,079
That's right.

359
00:31:20,819 --> 00:31:23,390
Who can easily fabricate...

360
00:31:24,289 --> 00:31:25,319
the evidence though?

361
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,359
There's someone I'm suspicious of.

362
00:31:30,529 --> 00:31:31,630
Investigator Min!

363
00:31:32,859 --> 00:31:34,660
Prosecutor Kang is inside.

364
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:37,000
We're actually here to see you.

365
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:39,099
- Me?
- At the next hearing,

366
00:31:39,099 --> 00:31:41,670
we're calling you to the stand.

367
00:31:42,269 --> 00:31:45,009
I already testified
during the first hearing.

368
00:31:45,009 --> 00:31:47,180
I wasn't the attorney then.

369
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:52,619
Someone showed my client
an interesting video.

370
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:55,349
- So?
- You'll be surprised to know...

371
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:57,289
who that someone is.

372
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,720
It was Chairman An.

373
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:12,140
The article about you,
selling your shares...

374
00:32:12,339 --> 00:32:15,869
will hit news outlets
after Judge Cha's interview.

375
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:17,569
- Is that so?
- Yes.

376
00:32:18,309 --> 00:32:19,779
I wonder if...

377
00:32:20,809 --> 00:32:24,480
Judge Cha will light up
the fire for me a little more.

378
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,880
I'll have my boys
stir things up for sure.

379
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,690
Don't make them go
their separate ways...

380
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,259
after the election.

381
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:34,259
Keep them under you.

382
00:32:34,289 --> 00:32:35,329
Yes, sir.

383
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:38,289
Chairman An! Chairman An.

384
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,529
Someone from the prosecution service
shouldn't be in and out of here.

385
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:45,799
As you know,

386
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,670
I put my trust in you
and cooperated with you.

387
00:32:49,609 --> 00:32:50,640
Is there...

388
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:53,640
a video you took...

389
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,950
regarding the incident?

390
00:32:56,779 --> 00:32:57,849
A video?

391
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,920
- Gwan Dong, do your job.
- Yes, sir.

392
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:04,250
Let's talk outside.

393
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:07,319
Tell me you don't have one.

394
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:09,430
You brat. You're getting cheeky
just because Mr. An...

395
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:11,730
let you sit across him.

396
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,759
A video, you ask?

397
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,200
How dare a government employee...

398
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,069
threaten...

399
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:21,269
a mayoral candidate!

400
00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:22,369
You punk!

401
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,170
Everyone, please leave. Go on.

402
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:27,180
Was that
enough of an answer for you?

403
00:33:32,849 --> 00:33:34,119
Hello?

404
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,420
Yes, of course. My gosh.

405
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:40,789
To what do I owe the pleasure of
hearing from Mr. Nam's daughter?

406
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:43,990
Get him out of here.

407
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,000
Let's talk.

408
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:53,299
What took you so long? I told you
to come as soon as you can.

409
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,809
Sorry, we had to set up
some traps before coming here.

410
00:33:55,809 --> 00:33:58,410
Please tell us about the video clip
An Oh Ju showed you.

411
00:33:58,779 --> 00:33:59,809
It looks like...

412
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:02,910
someone manipulated the scene.

413
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:06,980
I don't know who did it though.

414
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:10,719
But I noticed...

415
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:12,719
something in the video clip.

416
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:13,989
What is it?

417
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:16,159
A truck. There was a truck.

418
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,260
Guys, look at this drawing.

419
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,769
This truck was parked at the scene
at the time of the incident.

420
00:34:23,769 --> 00:34:25,329
This is about a truck,
not a witness?

421
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:27,869
- You want the dashcam, right?
- Yes, bingo.

422
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,809
You guys have to...

423
00:34:30,809 --> 00:34:32,239
find this truck before the trial.

424
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,610
- Got it, Boss.
- Okay?

425
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,079
What on earth
are you doing here again?

426
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:44,090
You all look so surprised. I guess
Attorney Bong hasn't told you yet.

427
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:47,119
He must've wanted
to keep it between us.

428
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,130
Oh, you're here. Ms. Hook.

429
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:53,329
Gosh, Attorney Bong.
Why didn't you tell them?

430
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:57,300
I'll be working with you all here
at Lawless Law Firm starting today.

431
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,170
- My name is Geum Ja.
- Gosh!

432
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,010
She'll collect all the money
we haven't been able to collect.

433
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,480
How could I not hire her?

434
00:35:06,309 --> 00:35:08,239
We'll collect money
from all the outstanding accounts...

435
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,010
and quit the private loan business.

436
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:13,750
Attorney Bong, you can't do this.

437
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:17,320
It'll be extremely uncomfortable
to work with my sister...

438
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,650
Attorney Bong.

439
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,059
Here's my first accomplishment.

440
00:35:24,429 --> 00:35:26,400
Bravo. My gosh.

441
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,400
As of yesterday, Mr. Kim...

442
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,230
from Heemang Supermarket has
paid 75 percent of what he owes us.

443
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,400
That man tried so hard
not to pay us back.

444
00:35:33,969 --> 00:35:36,570
- She did this at one blow?
- She did this at one blow?

445
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,579
Ms. Ha.

446
00:35:39,909 --> 00:35:43,079
I'll be sure to make your desk mine
within three months.

447
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,210
Sure.

448
00:35:52,889 --> 00:35:55,260
Jae I, you should vote
for Chairman An Oh Ju too.

449
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,889
I'm supporting his campaign.

450
00:35:56,889 --> 00:35:57,929
Dad.

451
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:02,400
That man, An Oh Ju, is a bad person.

452
00:36:02,699 --> 00:36:03,829
He mustn't be elected.

453
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:05,570
Who says that?

454
00:36:05,739 --> 00:36:07,840
It's just a false, slanderous rumor.

455
00:36:08,139 --> 00:36:10,909
He's promising us a complete
redevelopment of this area.

456
00:36:11,409 --> 00:36:15,510
And most importantly, Judge Cha
is supporting him, you know.

457
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,179
No more thinking is needed.

458
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,579
I'll do everything in my power
to help him.

459
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,719
Make sure you eat something. Bye.

460
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:23,250
- Dad. Dad!
- I have to go.

461
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:27,820
Oh, my goodness.

462
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:31,090
I'm so sorry
I made you come all the way here.

463
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:35,769
I just didn't want to meet you
at that crowded, noisy place.

464
00:36:35,869 --> 00:36:37,969
This way. Please have a seat here.

465
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:44,110
Are you sure you weren't trying
to avoid the prying eyes?

466
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,940
My gosh, not at all.

467
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,340
The campaign is in full swing
at the moment.

468
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:49,849
Why would I avoid
my potential voters?

469
00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:52,550
You must be busy,
so I'll cut to the chase.

470
00:36:53,619 --> 00:36:57,190
To what degree are you connected
to the murder of the former mayor?

471
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,230
Are you asking me this question
because my secretary's name...

472
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:06,630
was brought up during the trial?

473
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,260
Did you really hire a hitman...

474
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:11,769
through your secretary and ordered
the killing of Mayor Lee Young Soo?

475
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,309
Well...

476
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:19,840
That question.

477
00:37:21,409 --> 00:37:22,849
You chose to ask me...

478
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:27,119
here in my office,
not in the courtroom.

479
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:29,719
May I interpret that
in whichever way I see it,

480
00:37:30,489 --> 00:37:31,619
Prosecutor Kang?

481
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:33,260
Please don't jump
to your own conclusions.

482
00:37:34,059 --> 00:37:37,130
I won't go easy on you just because
you and my mother know each other.

483
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,869
I'm not being polite to you because
you're Ms. Nam Soon Ja's daughter.

484
00:37:43,869 --> 00:37:46,000
Next time,
I'll come with investigators...

485
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,440
as well as with your warrant
in my hands.

486
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,170
It looks like that's the only way
to get a clear answer out of you.

487
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,579
Goodbye for now.

488
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,420
Well, before you leave my office,

489
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,650
let me say something as well.

490
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,789
If you try to take me to court,

491
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:14,659
your mother, who loves you
so dearly, will be hurt too.

492
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:33,679
Keep it short. I'm busy now.

493
00:38:33,849 --> 00:38:37,320
Something must matter a lot more
than Prosecutor Kang to you.

494
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:39,960
What did you just say?

495
00:38:40,789 --> 00:38:43,260
What is this about? What now?

496
00:38:43,389 --> 00:38:46,630
Prosecutor Kang came to see me.

497
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,929
She talked to me
as if I'm the killer.

498
00:38:48,929 --> 00:38:50,030
So what?

499
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:53,739
Well, wasn't she the one
who fought so hard...

500
00:38:53,739 --> 00:38:57,840
to prosecute the case, saying
that Wu Hyung Man is the killer?

501
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,809
Please tell her
to just keep that up.

502
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:04,909
She'll be hurt if she changes
the direction now.

503
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,179
What?

504
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:08,219
You piece of... How dare you.

505
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,250
Please pass along the message.

506
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,960
This scum.

507
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:20,260
Well... Boss.

508
00:39:21,429 --> 00:39:25,739
Were you the one behind the murder?

509
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:27,869
You punk.

510
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:30,570
You'll get hurt.

511
00:39:31,139 --> 00:39:35,039
My life is already in your hands,
you know.

512
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:36,880
Shut it and watch this.

513
00:39:39,219 --> 00:39:42,119
This is a great example of when
our insurance comes in handy.

514
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,550
This is...

515
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:49,789
Isn't this a video that shows
how the scene...

516
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:53,260
of Mayor Lee Young Soo's murder
was manipulated?

517
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:55,559
Who's this guy?

518
00:39:55,559 --> 00:40:00,000
He has a serious gambling addiction.
What can I do?

519
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:02,340
I should give him a helping hand.

520
00:40:04,309 --> 00:40:06,139
This jerk... He is...

521
00:40:06,139 --> 00:40:08,980
He's an investigator
on Kang Yeon Hee's team.

522
00:40:09,179 --> 00:40:10,510
Does that mean...

523
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:14,519
Prosecutor Kang Yeon Hee
colluded with you on this?

524
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:15,889
No, it's quite the opposite of that.

525
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:19,559
Nam Soon Ja's daughter...

526
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,289
got roped into my plan.

527
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:25,559
Boss, don't you think
this is too risky?

528
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:28,059
She's a prosecutor after all.

529
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,670
- Gwan Dong.
- Yes, Boss.

530
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,429
You see,

531
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:36,409
you must stand at the edge
of your blade at all times.

532
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:40,309
Only then, you can find a way
to survive any situation.

533
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:43,050
Smarten up, you punk.

534
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:47,019
Hey, have you found anything?

535
00:40:47,019 --> 00:40:49,789
Yes, Boss. According to what we
heard from people at the warehouse,

536
00:40:49,889 --> 00:40:51,920
we believe that it was a food truck.

537
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:55,789
- A food truck?
- We'll look into food franchises.

538
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:57,829
- All right.
- A food truck?

539
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,130
There's no reason why the food
truck owner would commit suicide.

540
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:03,130
It's certainly not because of money.

541
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:05,199
He has no debt at all.

542
00:41:06,469 --> 00:41:10,440
Attorney Bong, I have to meet
Detective Gong Jang Soo.

543
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:13,039
Why?
Does something come to your mind?

544
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:14,940
No, I have no idea yet.

545
00:41:15,409 --> 00:41:17,309
But I can't sit back and do nothing.

546
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:23,019
You're not going alone.
I'll come with you.

547
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,460
You're highly likely to
be appointed as...

548
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:29,989
the next Chief Justice
of the Supreme Court.

549
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,059
Thank you for the suggestion,

550
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:35,099
but the only thing
I'm interested in...

551
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,500
is making sure
the people of Kiseong...

552
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:41,000
are protected by the law
justly and fairly.

553
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,110
So you're
not interested in the post.

554
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:48,510
Then may I ask you a question?

555
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:53,019
Is there a candidate in the upcoming
mayoral election whom you support?

556
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:54,949
Yes, of course.

557
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:59,820
What factors did you consider
prior to deciding whom to support?

558
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:03,429
Does the candidate want to be
the mayor to have more?

559
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:07,030
Or is the candidate willing to
sacrifice his or her everything...

560
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,860
to be elected as mayor?

561
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:12,699
Those were the questions
that I asked myself.

562
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:14,469
How thoughtful.

563
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:18,639
Personally, one candidate
is coming to my mind.

564
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:22,280
Whoever meets
Judge Cha's stringent standards...

565
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,280
I'm thinking of someone...

566
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,179
and his name is An...

567
00:42:26,179 --> 00:42:28,219
An Oh Ju.

568
00:42:28,219 --> 00:42:30,989
- An Oh Ju!

570
00:43:03,489 --> 00:43:05,420
Thank you for coming.

571
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,920
It's all so sudden.

572
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:09,360
I'm sorry for your loss.

573
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:10,960
Thanks for your condolences.

574
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:26,880
The old man...

575
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,010
was a judge for way too long.

576
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:31,210
He's finally dead.

577
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:34,420
I wish he burns forever.

578
00:43:34,949 --> 00:43:36,250
He got punished.

579
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:38,219
The scum.

580
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,920
He shouldn't have taken so much.

581
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:03,250
Hey.

582
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,710
Are you crazy?

583
00:44:08,349 --> 00:44:09,590
Judge Cha?

584
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:36,309
Haunt the borough office forever...

585
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:39,179
while your ashes rot.

586
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:50,130
Hello?

587
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:56,969
Yes.

588
00:44:58,329 --> 00:44:59,840
I'll be there right now.

589
00:45:02,369 --> 00:45:04,340
Finish your meal. I'll go alone.

590
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,710
- Yes, boss.
- Yes, boss.

591
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:28,260
Clean that up.

592
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,670
Do only I know about this?

593
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,170
You did it.

594
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,000
I have no idea.

595
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,750
I accomplished everything I can...

596
00:45:51,489 --> 00:45:52,960
in Kiseong.

Just watch how far I go after that.

599
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:03,929
I'm sorry, Dad,

600
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:05,699
but I want to go further than you.

601
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:08,900
Forgive me.

602
00:46:12,139 --> 00:46:13,579
- Detective.
- Hi.

603
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:15,940
Why did you want to see me?

604
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:21,880
A while ago you took the case
of the food truck owner's suicide.

605
00:46:22,519 --> 00:46:24,090
Yes. What about it?

606
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:27,889
Could I see the files
on that company?

607
00:46:29,659 --> 00:46:33,800
You can't. Our superiors
told us to close the case.

608
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,900
It has something
to do with our case.

609
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,130
Please cooperate.

610
00:46:48,579 --> 00:46:49,579
Here.

(Final hearing of Mayor
Lee Young Soo's murder trial)

612
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:07,500
I don't see Ms. Ha.

613
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:12,530
Don't you think seeing your trial
would be too much for her?

614
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,570
I guess, right?

615
00:47:18,269 --> 00:47:20,510
Despite that,
she wants to help you,

616
00:47:20,679 --> 00:47:22,409
so she is out gathering evidence.

617
00:47:24,179 --> 00:47:25,250
Because she is a lawyer.

618
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:30,190
How can you ask to see
our dashboard cameras?

619
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:31,190
No way.

620
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:34,219
Please, sir. It's crucial evidence
for our trial.

621
00:47:34,289 --> 00:47:36,460
According to the company's
regulations, I can't help you.

622
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:37,460
Go away.

623
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:38,690
- Sir.
- Hey.

624
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:40,559
What is it?

625
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:42,699
I thought you looked familiar.

626
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:45,730
It's you.

627
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:48,599
Didn't you borrow money
from me every other month?

628
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:52,840
- I did not...
- You can't fool me.

629
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:55,139
You work at such a great company.

630

Why did you need the extra cash?

631
00:47:57,710 --> 00:48:00,320
Are you threatening me?

632
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,219
This isn't a threat.

633
00:48:02,219 --> 00:48:04,219
I'm asking you to cooperate.

634
00:48:04,219 --> 00:48:06,260
Yes. Cooperate.

635
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:07,960
Now I'm curious.

636
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,690
Can I ask your wife in person?

637
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:12,460
Why you constantly needed
so much money?

638

- Hey.
- Hey.

Your contract must state
your family's contact number.

640

What's the matter?

641
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:23,869
It's nothing. Get back to work.

642
00:48:25,139 --> 00:48:26,280
Okay, okay.

643
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,840
Come with me.

644
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,210
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

645
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,750
You're pretty good, Hook.

646
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:35,079
That was nothing.

647
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:38,190
If it was one of ours,
it should be here.

648
00:48:38,389 --> 00:48:40,760
They haven't left the garage yet.

649
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,719
When will we check all these?

650
00:48:42,889 --> 00:48:44,829

The evidence and
witness I brought...

655
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:04,110
were all dismissed.

657
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:08,750
jumped out in front of
a train and killed himself.

00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,949
The defense attorney is
stating facts...

660
00:49:12,289 --> 00:49:13,659
unrelated to the trial.

661
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:14,760
Sustained.

662
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,230
Ever since the previous hearing,

663
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:20,659
your attitude,
defense attorney, has been...

664
00:49:20,929 --> 00:49:22,199
quite a disgrace.

665
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:24,269
Defendant.

666
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:27,070
Why do you think you were framed?

667
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:30,110
I think it's all my karma.

668
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:31,139
Karma?

669
00:49:31,769 --> 00:49:32,769
Yes.

670
00:49:33,139 --> 00:49:35,309
Until now, I used
my detective badge...

671
00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:37,610
to commit all sorts of
heinous crimes.

672
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:42,449
Of course, I could say I did it
to pay for my wife's treatment.

673
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:43,889
But...

674
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:45,989
not everyone with...

675
00:49:45,989 --> 00:49:48,760
a sick family member acts like me.

676
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,130
For a long time,

677
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:58,170
I was An Oh Ju's loyal dog...

678
00:49:58,269 --> 00:50:00,070
- Shut your mouth.
- As An Oh Ju's...

679
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,940
- You're evil.
- Be quiet.

680
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,070
Silence.

681
00:50:06,679 --> 00:50:10,079
If you say anything in court
that you cannot prove,

682
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:12,480
I will hold you responsible.

683
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,949
Already in court,

684
00:50:13,949 --> 00:50:17,090
we heard two names
connected to Chairman An.

685
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:18,119
So what?

686
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:20,489
To ensure this trial is impartial,

687
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:24,389
I believe An Oh Ju must be
brought in as a witness.

688
00:50:34,739 --> 00:50:37,840
I'll summon An Oh Ju as a witness.

689
00:50:38,269 --> 00:50:40,179
We shall recess for ten minutes.

690
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:46,420
- Hello, how are you?
- An Oh Ju.

691
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:47,880
- An Oh Ju.
- Are you well?

692
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,480
I'm An Oh Ju.

693
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,289
- Hello.
- An Oh Ju.

694
00:50:51,289 --> 00:50:52,320
It's for you.

695
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:54,659
Hello. What?

696
00:50:55,559 --> 00:51:00,829
Bong Sang Pil wants to
see me in court?

697
00:51:01,829 --> 00:51:04,269
Judge Cha seemed to allow it.

698
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:07,500
- Then there must be a reason.
- Just a moment.

699
00:51:07,969 --> 00:51:10,139
I'm busy. See you soon.

700
00:51:10,139 --> 00:51:12,769
Hello. Did you eat?

701
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,340
- Do you have anything?
- No.

702
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:18,110
- Did you find anything?
- Shut up and look.

703
00:51:18,349 --> 00:51:20,179
Ms. Ha! Oh, she's looking.

704
00:51:20,179 --> 00:51:21,980
Hey, do you have anything?

705
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:23,820
- Not yet.
- Seriously?

706
00:51:24,489 --> 00:51:26,349
Ms. Ha, anything?

707
00:51:26,489 --> 00:51:28,920
- Keep trying.
- Darn it.

708
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:32,329
There are only two other
trucks left. What now?

709
00:51:32,429 --> 00:51:34,199
- What a mess.
- She's so noisy.

710
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,929
She keeps saying Ms. Ha.

711
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,269
Introduce yourself.

712
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:43,309
I'm Prosecutor Kang Yeon Hee's
investigator.

713
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:45,539
Did you help
the detective in charge...

714
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:47,739
to collect evidence as well?

715
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:48,980
Yes.

716
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,309
Do you usually work so hard?

717
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:54,780
What do you mean?

718
00:51:57,849 --> 00:52:00,690
You have a grand sense of duty.

719
00:52:02,489 --> 00:52:04,989
Shoes with soles
that match my client's...

720
00:52:04,989 --> 00:52:07,659
and the pants with
the mayor's blood.

721
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:11,469
You found all the crucial evidence.

722
00:52:12,099 --> 00:52:13,570
Quicker than the detective did.

723
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:16,070
Is it a crime to work hard?

724
00:52:22,179 --> 00:52:23,250
It's not a crime.

725
00:52:24,409 --> 00:52:27,550
When did you go
to the scene of the crime?

726
00:52:28,349 --> 00:52:30,690
I went there after I got a call
from the detective in charge.

727
00:52:32,219 --> 00:52:33,360
Are you sure?

728
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:36,489
It's different from what I saw.

729
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:40,260
What did you see?

730
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,230
Your Honor.

731
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:45,730
We just got a new evidence.

732
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,670
We don't have a prior
consultation for the evidence.

733
00:52:50,469 --> 00:52:51,670
Step forward.

734
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:01,349
It'd be good
for Prosecutor Kang Yeon Hee...

735
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:03,519
to reveal the evidence
in this trial.

736
00:53:03,519 --> 00:53:05,349
What are you talking about?

737
00:53:05,619 --> 00:53:08,360
If she tries to hide
the evidence that shows...

738
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,989
her investigator
manipulated the case,

739
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:12,730
what do you think that means?

740
00:53:14,829 --> 00:53:16,869
I trust Prosecutor Kang Yeon Hee.

741
00:53:16,869 --> 00:53:18,800
What are you saying?

742
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,599
Are you saying
the case was fabricated?

743
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:23,099
To prove
Prosecutor Kang's innocence,

744
00:53:24,909 --> 00:53:27,739
please let me reveal
this evidence here.

745
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,420
Your Honor.

746
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,690
I agree to reveal the evidence.

747
00:53:43,889 --> 00:53:45,059
Okay.

748
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:49,760
Okay. Defense attorney,
reveal the evidence.

749
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,030
Isn't he the investigator?

750
00:54:24,199 --> 00:54:26,030
- I think so.
- Yes.

751
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:27,840
- That's the investigator, right?
- That's him.

752
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:31,969
- That's right. It's him.
- That's right.

753
00:54:44,289 --> 00:54:46,389
No, it's not me. It's not me.

754
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,429
Let go of me! Get off!

755
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:00,599
Get off!

756
00:55:02,539 --> 00:55:03,639
Your Honor.

757
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:07,480
I admit that
the prosecution is wrong.

758
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:12,309
I just found out that the evidence
to prove Wu Hyung Man...

759
00:55:12,849 --> 00:55:14,550
as defendant was fabricated.

760
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,489
I hereby...

761
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:21,519
drop the charges
against the defendant.

762
00:55:36,269 --> 00:55:39,309
Now that the prosecutor
dropped the charges,

763
00:55:39,309 --> 00:55:42,179
I dismiss the charges
against the defendant.

764
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:44,309
The trial is dismissed.

765
00:55:51,619 --> 00:55:52,820
Thank you so much.

766
00:55:54,219 --> 00:55:55,289
Hello?

767
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:57,889
What?

768
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:00,659
Okay.

769
00:56:03,329 --> 00:56:05,099
We should go to the hospital now.

770
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:20,119
Judge Cha, please save
my daughter, Yeon Hee.

771
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,590
Prosecutor Kang
didn't do anything wrong.

772
00:56:25,219 --> 00:56:27,489
She was deceived
by the investigator.

773
00:56:27,989 --> 00:56:30,429
She trusted a wrong person.

774
00:56:31,059 --> 00:56:32,429
That's her fault.

775
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:35,929
Judge Cha, please.

776
00:56:35,929 --> 00:56:37,230
Please save her this once.

777
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,400
Please forgive her just once.

778
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,769
Judge Cha, please.

779
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:44,539
Honey.

780
00:56:45,809 --> 00:56:46,809
Honey.

781
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:49,639
Honey.

782
00:56:53,849 --> 00:56:54,949
It's all good now.

783
00:56:55,949 --> 00:56:58,889
Now that you're found not guilty,

784
00:57:01,289 --> 00:57:02,360
you should...

785
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,960
beg forgiveness...

786
00:57:08,030 --> 00:57:09,059
for...

787
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:12,030
what you've done.

788
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:13,969
Honey.

789
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:16,739
You have to do that.

790
00:57:17,469 --> 00:57:19,039
Okay. I will.

791
00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:21,880
I'll do that for sure.

792
00:57:25,579 --> 00:57:27,949
Thank you for...

793
00:57:30,389 --> 00:57:31,889
staying by my side.

795
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:38,360
No. Honey!

796
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:41,000
Honey!

797

you wanted to stay closer
with me than Jae I the whole time.

What about now?

807
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,820
I want to become...

the strongest prosecutor

00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,409

I'm not sure
if this is a fate or not,

01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,829
(An Oh Ju, in 2000,
Kim Ho Sik, Choi Jin Ae)

827
01:00:34,969 --> 01:00:36,599
They're the people...

828
01:00:37,239 --> 01:00:39,739
whom we will have to pay back
with interest.

829
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,050
The Seven.

830
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:49,980
That's what they're called.

831
01:00:58,829 --> 01:00:59,960
This place...

832
01:01:00,329 --> 01:01:02,130
It is the real Kiseong in Kiseong.

833
01:01:10,809 --> 01:01:13,840
She's Prosecutor Kang Yeon Hee
who's officially joining...

834
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:15,579
our gathering from today.

835
01:01:19,849 --> 01:01:21,420
It's a pleasure to meet you,

836
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:23,380
Prosecutor Kang.

837
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:28,460
Prosecutor Kang, we meet again.

838
01:01:28,989 --> 01:01:30,389
Welcome, Prosecutor Kang.

839
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:35,300
The red and clear blood of Kiseong!

840
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:38,130
Ms. Nam,

841
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:40,369
aren't you going to say anything?

842
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,369
Welcome, Yeon Hee.

843
01:01:46,769 --> 01:01:48,309
I'm Prosecutor King Yeon Hee.

844
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:49,909
Welcome, Yeon Hee.

845
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:52,579
Prosecutor Kang...

846
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:56,280
can lead the investigation
into Mayoral Candidate An.

847
01:01:56,280 --> 01:02:00,559
Don't pester her
with such frivolous jobs.

848
01:02:00,659 --> 01:02:02,690
The approval rate of
mayoral candidates...

849
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:05,690
have shifted completely
to Chairman An.

850
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:07,559
Now that's worth a celebration!

851
01:02:07,559 --> 01:02:09,800
My goodness, congratulations.

852
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:12,070
- Chairman An.
- Congratulations.

853
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:23,539
I, An Oh Ju,

854
01:02:24,349 --> 01:02:25,980
will let you have...

855
01:02:27,519 --> 01:02:30,989
everything I have to offer
including my flesh and blood.

856
01:02:32,019 --> 01:02:33,489
Congratulations, Chairman An.

857
01:02:34,159 --> 01:02:35,289
Now get up.

858
01:02:41,329 --> 01:02:44,769
I've been wrong about you
up until now.

859
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:46,570
Congratulations.

860
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:48,300
What a magnificent start,

861
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:50,340
Prosecutor Kang.

862
01:02:57,550 --> 01:02:59,650
An Oh Ju doesn't need
any explanation.

863
01:03:01,219 --> 01:03:02,420
Next is Attorney Go In Du.

864
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:04,449
He's rotten to the core.

865
01:03:04,849 --> 01:03:06,820
He's been serving
Cha Moon Sook's family.

866
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:09,489
18 years ago, he let the plaintiff
lose the redevelopment case,

867
01:03:10,059 --> 01:03:12,889
and has been dismissing
related cases to date.

868
01:03:13,829 --> 01:03:15,000
Son Sung Sik.

869
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:19,329
18 years ago, he lent An Oh Ju money
he couldn't pay back.

870
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:21,800
After becoming Ohju Group's
Chief Financial Officer,

871
01:03:22,099 --> 01:03:23,469
he's been living the good life.

872
01:03:23,699 --> 01:03:25,869
Now, he's the president of
Kiseong Savings Bank.

873
01:03:27,309 --> 01:03:29,110
Han Tae Kyeong of Kiseong Daily.

874
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:33,980
My mom's suicide immediately
made its headlines,

875
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:38,090
but blocked all the articles
about your mom.

876
01:03:39,949 --> 01:03:41,090
Jang Sang Ik.

877
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:43,559
Chief Prosecutor of
Kiseong Prosecution Service.

878
01:03:44,789 --> 01:03:48,460
18 years ago, he was the go-to man
that buried cases for them.

879
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,230
Nam Soon Ja.

880
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:56,070
She's been Cha Moon Sook's
secretary since she was young.

881
01:03:57,239 --> 01:03:59,110
18 years back and even now,

882
01:03:59,309 --> 01:04:02,679
she's the only door
that opens to Cha Moon Sook.

883
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:08,050
"The Seven" is the powerhouse
that governs Kiseong.

884
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:10,949
They're who we must go up against.

885
01:04:11,789 --> 01:04:14,920
Of course, the two of us
won't be a match for them.

886
01:04:16,659 --> 01:04:19,630
Wu Hyung Man is
the first puzzle of this war.

887
01:04:21,929 --> 01:04:23,099
You're right.

888
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:25,400
He still hasn't got
a non-guilty verdict yet.

889
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:30,199
An Oh Ju and Cha Moon Sook
are still at their places,

890
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:32,309
so nothing has changed.

891
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:35,940
Lawless lawyers.

892
01:04:39,809 --> 01:04:42,219
Our battle begins now.

893
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:52,929
With the law.

894
01:04:53,889 --> 01:04:55,000
With the law.

895
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:18,019
(Lawless Lawyer)

896
01:05:18,349 --> 01:05:20,119
Law-abiding city, Kiseong!

897
01:05:20,119 --> 01:05:22,559
I'll be a mayor worthy of it.

898
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:24,090
We need people to help us.

899
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:26,789
You're only a thug
who has studied the law.

900
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:29,230
Come to Kiseong,
the city without laws.

901
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,570
Once my suspension is over,

902
01:05:31,869 --> 01:05:34,340
I'll investigate and
reveal your crimes,

903
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:35,840
and put you on trial.

904
01:05:36,139 --> 01:05:38,510
Where An Oh Ju is,
Wu Hyung Man will be there.

905
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:40,340
Bong Sang Pil and Ha Jae I.

906
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:42,409
I want them both gone.

907
01:05:42,409 --> 01:05:43,539
Hyung Man!

908
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:46,349
I'll put you on trial
no matter what.
