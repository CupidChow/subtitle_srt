(Lawless Lawyer)

00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:35,240
We'll now begin the second trial
for the Choi Dae Woong murder case.

8
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,640
Your Honor.
We want a witness to be summoned.

9
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,380
Who is the witness?

10
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:51,960
He's the Mayor of Kiseong, An Oh Ju.

11
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,939
Judge Cha Moon Sook.

12
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,680
I, Mayor An Oh Ju,

13
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,219
will speak the truth with my name.

14
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:27,629
Bong Sang Pil,
who's sitting right over there...

15
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,329
isn't the culprit.

16
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:50,920
What do you want from me?

17
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,920
(New Record)

18
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,310
You're going to prove
Attorney Bong's innocence?

19
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,849
My goodness, you and Bong Sang Pil
are like two peas in a pod.

20
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,449
You're very impatient.

21
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,819
I know that you framed him
for the murder.

22
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,120
Will you make a confession
in the courtroom or what?

23
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,960
Well, about that...

24
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,500
I won't say anything.

25
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:41,330
Who knows?
You might have brought...

26
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:44,139
a bug or a voice recorder
into this office...

27
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:47,340
like we see in movies all the time.

28
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,180
There.

29
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,379
Now, tell me why
you're making such a proposition.

30
00:02:57,379 --> 00:03:01,090
Well, aren't you here
because you find it appealing?

31
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:07,159
If the trial keeps dragging on,

32
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:09,689
it'll only put
Bong Sang Pil in a bigger danger.

33
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:13,330
Who knows what can
happen to him in the prison?

34
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,139
What do you want?

35
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,800
What do I want?

36
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,810
- Hey, Gwan Dong.
- Yes, sir.

37
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,039
- Bring out some tea for us.
- Yes, sir.

38
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:30,280
When the trial is over,

39
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,419
you'll find out naturally what it is
that I wanted.

40
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:36,889
You'll learn
what I'm gaining from it.

41
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:43,599
Are you confused?

42
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:48,469
Frankly, I don't really care
whether that punk,

43
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,500
Bong Sang Pil, dies or not, but...

44
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:53,539
I must say,
you haven't changed one bit,

45
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,069
Miss Lawyer.

46
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,909
I approve your request.

47
00:03:58,009 --> 00:03:59,610
The witness may be seated.

48
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,379
(Episode 11)

49
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:06,349
Is there a reason you're claiming
the defendant is not guilty?

50
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:12,159
Yes, of course.

51
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,629
Then please tell us the reason.

52
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,399
All people of Kiseong
who are here today,

53
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,699
I'd like to tell you the truth...

54
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,970
about this case.

55
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,110
The person...

56
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,649
who killed the victim...

57
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,750
is my bodyguard.

58
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,660
Your bodyguard?

59
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,329
What was his motive?

60
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:51,060
He's seen everything
Bong Sang Pil did...

61
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:55,230
to threaten and harm me.

62
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:00,740
His misguided loyalty toward me...

63
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,240
was what led to this tragedy.

64
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,250
Does this mean you've
persuaded him to come clean?

65
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,420
Of course.

66
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,350
I persuaded him to turn himself in.

67
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:19,319
Mr. Prosecutor, you should be
getting a call about it very soon.

68
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:24,660
(Investigator Gong Jang Soo)

69
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,000
(A man just turned himself in
saying he killed Choi Dae Woong.)

70
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,000
All right.

71
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:31,769
Then what I'd like to know is...

72
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,339
why you came here to testify
when reporting him was enough.

73
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,850
That's a very good question.

74
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:00,800
First of all, I'd like to...

75
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:04,300
sincerely apologize
to Attorney Bong Sang Pil...

76
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,269
for having to be here because of me.

77
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,040
And my bodyguard now has to...

78
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,709
take responsibility for what he did
because of his misguided loyalty.

79
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,350
As his boss,

80
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,819
I'm here to help him...

81
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,649
get his sentence mitigated.

82
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:29,329
Please forgive him.

83
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,170
Prosecution and Defense Attorney,
come forward.

84
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:50,350
The witness
Mayor An just mentioned.

85
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,120
Have you gotten a call about it?

86
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,420
I just got a message. It looks like
we need to investigate him more.

87
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:59,120
A suspect just turned himself in,
so this trial is meaningless.

88
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,889
Points taken. Go back to your seats.

89
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,199
Mayor An Oh Ju...

90
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:13,810
came all the way here in person
to testify.

91
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:18,939
Please strictly examine
the credibility of his claim.

92
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,910
We'll end the trial here.

93
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:34,329
A chasm is forming between the
crocodile and the crocodile bird.

94
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,100
Why did you put your mayor post
on the line and testify, sir?

95
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,399
Did you suggest the idea to him?

96
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,670
Gosh, I won't answer.

97
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,240
Why did you come to court in person?

98
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,670
Do you have nothing
to do with the case, sir?

99
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:53,110
Well...

100
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:58,680
Let me say one thing
to prevent any misunderstandings.

101
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:01,220
I didn't come here to ask...

102
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,490
the judge to take
a year or two off his sentence.

103
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,089
My bodyguard
committed a very serious crime,

104
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,029
and he deserves to be
punished for what he did.

105
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:10,459
But you see,

106
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,600
he did it out of his loyalty for me.

107
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:16,470
As his boss,

108
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:19,240
I thought I should
apologize on his behalf...

109
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:23,370
and beg for forgiveness.
That's why I came here today.

110
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,879
- No more questions, please.
- Please tell us more!

111
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:27,279
- Sir.
- One more question, sir.

112
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,209
The perpetrator of Choi Dae
Woong's murder turned himself in.

113
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:34,149
Hence, Suspect Bong Sang Pil,
who has been...

114
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:37,389
undergoing trials, is acquitted,

115
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:38,919
and we drop charges against him.

116
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:42,259
I'd like to apologize...

117
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,330
to Attorney Bong Sang Pil
on behalf of the entire prosecution.

118
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:48,029
- Sir, what will happen to...
- Please tell us about...

119
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:52,299
Ha Jae I.

120
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,139
Jae I.

121
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:02,549
Did you make a deal...

122
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,879
with An Oh Ju for me?

123
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:08,850
I had to get you out
as soon as possible,

124
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,860
and he had something
to gain from the trial.

125
00:09:13,789 --> 00:09:15,889
We both benefited from it.

126
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,409
Wasn't that too risky, sir?

127
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,570
"Risky"?

128
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,409
- Hey, Gwan Dong.
- Yes, sir.

129
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,110
You see,

130
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,850
I walk on a blade every single day.

131
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,919
A very sharp blade.

132
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:47,220
We must risk such danger...

133
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:51,659
to gain something big in return.

134
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,600
Do you get what I'm saying?

135
00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:55,370
Yes, sir.

136
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:57,539
Call the PR team...

137
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,039
and tell them
to write a nice press release.

138
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:05,009
But I'm a little worried
about how Judge Cha...

139
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:06,940
will respond to it.

140
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,950
Cha Moon Sook and I are...

141
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:14,350
already at war.

142
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:18,519
You just don't hear any gunshots.

143
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:21,690
Judge Cha.

144
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,690
We have a big problem.

145
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,529
Please have a look at this.

146
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,100
("Kiseong Has Mayor An Oh Ju")

147
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,070
How dare they compare him to you.

148
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,000
From newspapers to the Internet,

149
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,139
everyone is busy
praising An Oh Ju at the moment.

150
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:37,139
("Powerbroker of Kiseong, An Oh Ju")

151
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:40,110
"Powerbroker of Kiseong"?
"In a new light"? Yeah right.

152
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:44,549
You're the one
who rules the city of Kiseong.

153
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,889
How can showing up in court
suddenly make him a star?

154
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:50,590
Gosh.

155
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:54,330
It just shows how
foolish and gullible people are.

156
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,029
An Oh Ju played them like a fiddle.

157
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,230
What a bunch of idiots.

158
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:02,799

- Boss.
- You're here!

00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:14,009
- Good.
- Great.

164
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:15,049

Good job hanging in there.

166
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,149
Just look at what his time in prison
did to his good looks.

167
00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:22,220
He's still handsome though.

168
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:26,889
Good job, everyone. Thank you.

169
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:29,159
Attorney Ha did all the hard work.

170
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,360
Let's applaud!

171
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:36,629
- What's all this?
- Please dig in.

172
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,169
Wasn't this just for you lot?

173
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:39,669
- No.
- Of course not!

174
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,940
We added tofu in the seafood stew.

175
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:46,210
- This is to die for.
- Let's eat.

176
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,309
Sure.

177
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:51,679
- Here. Have a drink.
- Thanks.

178
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,820
- It's always nice to be together.
- Of course.

179
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:01,990
Clear Bong Sang Pil's name.

180
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:07,629
Jae I, show me how good
of a lawyer you are.

181
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,129
Win his case.

182
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,980
Why do you think Moon Sook said it?

183
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,220
Her telling you to win my case?

184
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:26,950
Yes.

185
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,990
I think the one who ordered
the hit on me and An Oh Ju...

186
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,919
is Cha Moon Sook.

187
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:33,990
What?

188
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:37,830
I knew they were at odds,

189
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,899
but not to this length.

190
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,970
Our enemy has split into two.

191
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,870
Do you think this will benefit us?

192
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,309
It depends on whether
Judge Cha wanted this to happen.

193
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,080
I agree.

194
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:59,779
I feel like we've been
playing her game this whole time.

195
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,629
I should go and see her.

196
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:10,929
Jae I.

197
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,799
I'm going alone.

198
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,000
I need to know why.

199
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:45,600
Since you won the trial,

200
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,129
you're here to know why
I told you to win it.

201
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,570
However, you're not
worthy of my answer.

202
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,110
Why not?

203
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:57,340
You won because of
Mayor An's testimony,

204
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,940
not because of
what you did on your own.

205
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:02,379
Then I'll ask you something else.

206
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:08,350
Was lifting my suspension
the beginning to your plan?

207
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,590
"The beginning"?

208
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,159
To be honest,
I wanted you to follow...

209
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,629
in my footsteps as a prominent
member of the legal circle.

210
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,200
You probably won't believe this,

211
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:29,740
but I wanted to give you
what your mother...

212
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,940
couldn't.

213
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,610
If that's what you mean by
"beginning", then I'm guilty.

214
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,250
However, Bong Sang Pil
did mess up my plan.

215
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:42,490
Fortunately for me,
he showed me the truth.

216
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,059
He helped me see the ugliness
behind the mask you wear.

217
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:51,360
I guess there's nothing more
to hear from you.

218
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,169
Let me ask you this though.

219
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:59,000
What if your mother was alive?

220
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:05,980
Would you be able to return
to your old self again?

221
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:09,250
Or has Bong Sang Pil
corrupted you too much?

222
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:14,049
My mom and Bong Sang Pil.

223
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,960
Don't use them to make me waver.

224
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:21,029
If you do, I'll even forget...

225
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:23,330
about all the good
you've done for me.

226
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:37,740
- Boss.
- Hey, Kwang Soo.

227
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:39,779
What were you thinking about?

228
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:44,110
Are you worried about Attorney Ha?

229
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,519
She made a deal
with An Oh Ju to help me.

230
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,820
I'm making her go through too much.

231
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,889
- Boss.
- I don't know...

232
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:57,460
whether I should be
making her life so hard.

233
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:17,049
President Park,
you know I always pack a punch.

234
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,049
All right. I'll see you later then.

235
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,759
Bong Sang Pil, you're here.

236
00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:31,830
Are you here to thank me
for saving your butt...

237
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,159
in court?

238
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,830
- Is that what you expected?
- Have a seat.

239
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:38,440
What?

240
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,639
Does being on my home turf...

241
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:43,210
scare you?

242
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,639
From what I hear,

243
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:48,080
you and Cha Moon Sook
are on the outs.

244
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,750
Bong Sang Pil,

245
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,950
it'll now be twice as hard for you.

246
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,820
So what now?

247
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,490
You'll know as I make my move.

248
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,830
Watch and see
what happens to Judge Cha.

249
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,559
Don't miss the news from now on...

250
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,700
because I'm coming after you next.

251
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,269
Is this your way of saying
that I'm a bigger fish...

252
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,700
than she is?

253
00:17:14,509 --> 00:17:15,509
Why?

254
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,369
Do you like that?

255
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,509
Why go to extra lengths...

256
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:25,650
when you can just kill me?

257
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,690
Just do it right here.

258
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,119
What's the point in
causing havoc outside?

259
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,789
I'd like to do that,

260
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:39,559
but I'll get my revenge
with the law.

261
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,930
Sure, that's good.

262
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,730
Law is a good way to go.

263
00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:45,670
Still,

264
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,569
it doesn't seem like
you've come to your senses.

265
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:54,480
In Kiseong,
there's something above...

266
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:57,009
that so-called law you believe in.

267
00:17:58,819 --> 00:18:00,019
The city has its own laws.

268
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:03,589
The day you stand
in Kiseong District Court...

269
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,519
is the day
the law of Kiseong crumbles.

270
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:19,039
Don't ever think
about going near Jae I.

271
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:22,509
If you do,
I'll make you pay without the law.

272
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:36,890
Ma'am.

273
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:42,029
I thought Judge Cha
didn't need my services today.

274
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:47,000
She's been under
a lot of stress lately.

275
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,700
Serve her well.

276
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,000
Yes, ma'am.

277
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,269
Judge Cha,
I didn't know you were here.

278
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:59,779
- You can get going now.
- Yes, ma'am.

279
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:05,849
I'll get ready for your massage.

280
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,920
Hold on.

281
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,289
Bring my phone from my room.

282
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:15,130
Yes, ma'am.

283
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,880
Yes, sir?

284
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,450
That'd be great.

285
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,190
We should
exercise together some time.

286
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,500
It's nothing big,

287
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:01,710
but I need you to do something.

288
00:20:04,009 --> 00:20:07,240
Gwan Dong will be
recognized too easily.

289
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:13,720
Meanwhile,

290
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:16,250
you're on the run.

291
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:19,720
If you don't want to get caught,

292
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,630
you should stay better hidden.

293
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:24,630
Yes, sir.

294
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,829
Judge Cha Moon Sook.

295
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,099
Keep an eye on her.

296
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,740
Yes, sir.

297
00:20:34,369 --> 00:20:35,869
Boss! Boss!

298
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:38,480
What the...

299
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:39,710
Hey.

300
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:42,009
You jerk. Come here. Hey!

301
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:44,180
- How dare you!
- Calm down.

302
00:20:44,349 --> 00:20:46,349
I went everywhere looking for you!

303
00:20:46,349 --> 00:20:47,519
He's hurt.

304
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:48,519
Geum Kang.

305
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:51,890
You idiot. What on earth
happened to you?

306
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:55,589
Do you know anything about
the anesthetic? Was it you?

307
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,759
Was it really you?

308
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,000
No.

309
00:20:59,329 --> 00:21:00,960
When I was sleeping...

310
00:21:01,829 --> 00:21:03,299
Gosh, who was he?

311
00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:06,640
Oh, right.
An Oh Ju's former secretary.

312
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,170
- His former secretary?
- Yes.

313
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,779
Oh, the lanky guy who put a
tracking device on us at the court?

314
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:12,940
Yes, that's right.

315
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:16,150
That jerk walked in
with a box and left it here.

316
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:18,250
I told him to get it
out of here, and he...

317
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,519
- And did he take you?
- Yes.

318
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:22,190
That's why you ended up like this?

319
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,289
Yes.

320
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,829
I'm sorry, Attorney Bong.

321
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:30,690
Because of me...

322
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,430
No, it's okay.

323
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:37,130
It wasn't your fault,
so take care of yourself first.

324
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:40,299
When an underling does
something wrong,

325
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,970
I should be understanding about it
and try to help him out.

326
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,369
What can I do?

327
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:48,180
I have an important guest.

328
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:49,650
I have to go.

329
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,549
My gosh, what brings you here?

330
00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:56,789
I would've come to you
had you called me.

331
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,960
Here's Judge Cha's gift for you.

332
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:05,299
Oh, my. Thank you very much.

333
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:09,269
Well, I want to hear the real reason
you decided to come to court,

334
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,470
not what you told the reporters.

335
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,410
Well, I decided to...

336
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:19,380
appear in court because of you,
ma'am.

337
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:20,839
What?

338
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:26,779
Could we talk privately about it?

339
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,490
Wait outside.

340
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:30,849
Yes, ma'am.

341
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:37,990
Just a moment, please.

342
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:45,470
Hey, is there anything you know?

343
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:47,400
Sorry? Me? Gosh, no.

344
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:50,940
Madam Nam, I know nothing.

345
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,539
Even if I know something,
I can't tell you.

346
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,380
That's real helpful.

347
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,549
How would I know
anything that you don't know?

348
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:06,259
By the way,

349
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:09,589
I heard that you're like
Judge Cha's doorknob.

350
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:14,000
I guess you've done nothing
but open the doors for people.

351
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,200
What?

352
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:19,269
What did you just say?
You jerk, have you lost your mind?

353
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,940
I got this...

354
00:23:22,539 --> 00:23:24,539
on the day of the trial...

355
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,980
along with a threatening phone call.

356
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,750
On the day of the trial?

357
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,349
I was told that...

358
00:23:37,089 --> 00:23:38,920
what happened 18 years ago...

359
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,490
would be blown wide open
if I didn't testify.

360
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,500
Well... I'm sorry
I couldn't tell you...

361
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:49,769
before the trial.

362
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,740
Do you think this was
Bong Sang Pil's doing?

363
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,769
Who else in Kiseong...

364
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,339
would do such a thing?

365
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:03,250
Judge Cha.

366
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:07,750
Everything I do...

367
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:10,750
is based on
wanting to protect you...

368
00:24:11,619 --> 00:24:14,359
and my loyalty to you.

369
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,230
You see...

370
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:20,630
Just like my bodyguard
who agreed to go to jail...

371
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:23,869
for a little bit of money
to help me bury the case.

372
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,880
This came for you, sir.

373
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:40,250
Is somebody trying to
threaten me already,

374
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,920
knowing that
I'll be running for mayor?

375
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,630
My gosh, who knew that these photos
would be so useful?

376
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:54,630
By the way,
why did you lie to her, sir?

377
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:57,170
There was no such
threatening phone call.

378
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:58,740
Hey.

379
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,970
Did it look like she was buying it?

380
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,740
Well, I'm not sure.

381
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,180
- Gwan Dong.
- Yes, sir.

382
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:13,380
I'm a politician now.

383
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,720
A good lie...

384
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:19,559
has to have some truth in it.

385
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:23,089
A lie that's authentic.

386
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:26,059
It must have some truth in it...

387
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:28,160
for people to believe it.

388
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,670
So, you're saying Judge Cha
has an important meeting, right?

389
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:37,240
Yes, tomorrow 3pm
at Kiseong Country Club.

390
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:40,009
- Got it, thank you.
- No problem.

391
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,279
Oh, this is great.

392
00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:45,980
This is my colleague,
Attorney Bong Sang Pil.

393
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,450
This is the lady who works at
Judge Cha's private residence.

394
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:49,819
I should get going.

395
00:25:55,829 --> 00:25:58,529
Who gave you this?

396
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:00,299
A woman.

397
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:02,599
I think she knows your uncle.

398
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,599
You can trust him.

399
00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:08,740
He and I do everything together.

400
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,940
Attorney Ha told me a lot about you.

401
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,440
I don't mean to be rude,

402
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:19,319
but may I ask you
how you know my uncle?

403
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:24,319
Mr. Choi Dae Woong helped me out
a lot before he passed away.

404
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:28,160
I'm helping Attorney Ha
to repay his kindness.

405
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:31,059
Shouldn't you have come to me first
if that had been the case?

406
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:34,359
- Attorney Bong.
- You want to take down Judge Cha.

407
00:26:35,069 --> 00:26:36,599
May I ask you why?

408
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:38,640
I'm very busy today.

409
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:40,170
I'll visit again another time.

410
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:41,269
Mama.

411
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:49,950
Mama.

412
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:54,380
He just worries about me a lot.

413
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:55,589
I'm sorry about that.

414
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,119
It's okay. I should get going.

415
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,029
Attorney Ha Jae I.

416
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:13,240
How about we go on a date?
It's been too long.

417
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,410
I'll take 7 of the regular one,
and 2 is for here.

418
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:28,119
Oh, please add
avocado on one of them.

419
00:27:33,589 --> 00:27:34,819
This is going to be good.

420
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:37,859
How did you know
that I like avocado?

421
00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:38,930
Goodness.

422
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,230
What will you do later on if you're
moved by something this little?

423
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:50,609
You're so sweet to me.

424
00:27:50,609 --> 00:27:53,079
Can't you be just as nice
to other people?

425
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,109
I could tell from your face
that you doubt her.

426
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:57,809
I trust everything
that she tells me.

427
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,250
Can't you try to do the same?

428
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,420
I know that you trust her.

429
00:28:06,289 --> 00:28:08,319
But to me, your safety comes first.

430
00:28:17,769 --> 00:28:20,299
Mr. Tae, call everyone now.

431
00:28:21,069 --> 00:28:23,339
No team dinner for tonight.

432
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:24,809
We have to have a meeting.

433
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:39,619
Golden City's union president was
killed 18 years ago, but it was...

434
00:28:39,619 --> 00:28:40,960
handled as a missing person case.

435
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,190
Cha Moon Sook got An Oh Ju...

436
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:45,230
to bury the murder she committed.

437
00:28:48,529 --> 00:28:51,000
Boss, everyone is here now.

438
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,740
The tables have turned, Mr. Tae.

439
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:56,240
Now, we're going to directly
target Cha Moon Sook.

440
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,509
You mean Judge Cha?

441
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,579
That's right.

442
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,440
Attorney Bong is right.

443
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,309
It's an all-out war now.

444
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:28,509
The location is
Kiseong Country Club.

445
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:32,180
You guys will have to go
to this place and find out...

446
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,380
whom Judge Cha is meeting, and
what their conversations are about.

447
00:29:34,579 --> 00:29:37,410
That will be your job.

448
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,650
Okay?

449
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:40,180
Shall we use our drone?

450
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,190
Kwang Soo, the drone?

451
00:29:42,849 --> 00:29:44,190
I miss using it.

452
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:47,990
From what I remember...
It looks like this, doesn't it?

453
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:48,990
This is it, right?

454
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:53,460
Good idea, but you're not allowed
to fly a drone over the golf course.

455
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,829
That's too bad.
I wanted to use it again.

456
00:29:58,369 --> 00:30:00,670
- Geum Ja.
- Gosh, my heart.

457
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:02,039
Why did you call my name suddenly?

458
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:05,069
Only you can pull off this mission.

459
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:07,079
- Me?
- If it's anyone else,

460
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:09,009
the cover will get blown.

461
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,049
You want her to go undercover?

462
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:12,619
I'd do a much better job.

463
00:30:12,619 --> 00:30:16,319
You idiot,
she's saying they know your face.

464
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:17,319
Gosh, you're killing me.

465
00:30:17,589 --> 00:30:21,119
All right, guys. Have a look
at this. This is the golf course.

466
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:26,200
Geum Ja, go undercover as a caddie
and tail Cha Moon Sook, okay?

467
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,269
Oh, no. That was so close.

468
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,410
Oh, my goodness! Nice!

469
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,210
You're so amazing.

470
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,880
Judge Cha, do you take lessons?

471
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:51,119
Let's go.

472
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:55,759
You can walk.

473
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,230
Bye.

474
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:01,559
It's really hot.

475
00:31:03,769 --> 00:31:05,069
Did you do it?

476
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,769
I did.

477
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,970
Well done. It suits us.

478
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:23,119
Today...

479
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,759
I want an answer.

480
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:30,089
From now on,
we should play in Seoul.

481
00:31:30,829 --> 00:31:32,329
Is that a yes?

482
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:35,869
Yes.

483
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,470
But I'll do things my way.

484
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,099
Your way means...

485
00:31:41,369 --> 00:31:42,740
I need a cause.

486
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:44,769
"A cause"?

487
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:52,880
The seat of Chief Justice
of the Supreme Court is vacant.

488
00:31:53,619 --> 00:31:56,890
I need you to give me a reason.

489
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,660
She wants to become Chief Justice?

490
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:12,069
Today's sentence...

491
00:32:12,339 --> 00:32:17,039
is against a man who stalked
a 20-year-old woman for years,

492
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:20,140
sexually assaulted her
and then killed her.

493
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:25,750
He then damaged her body
in a very cruel manner.

494
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:28,220
- How could he?
- What a monster.

495
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,589
No way. That's so cruel.

496
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:35,059
I'll deliver the sentence.

497
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,200
In the name of law and justice,

498
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:45,670
my sentence is to separate
this man from society forever.

499
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:48,970
I sentence...

500
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:53,480
the defendant to the most
severe punishment I possibly can.

501
00:32:55,579 --> 00:32:57,480
I sentence him to death.

502
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:01,049
- Well done.
- Yes!

503
00:33:01,049 --> 00:33:03,049
- You're the best.
- She is.

504
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:04,589
Well done.

505
00:33:04,589 --> 00:33:06,990
I feel so much better now.

506
00:33:07,059 --> 00:33:08,490
Good riddance.

507
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,960
You call him a son?

508
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,029
Execution?

509
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:13,859
You'll execute him?

510
00:33:14,029 --> 00:33:16,299
How dare you execute my son?

511
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:19,000
Death? What makes you so special?

512
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:21,569
Who do you think you are?

513
00:33:24,339 --> 00:33:27,039
Do you hope that
the death sentence is carried out?

514
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,579
I gave the sentence
after much deliberation,

515
00:33:29,579 --> 00:33:32,220
but the final decision
is the president's.

516
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:35,319
The candidate for chief justice
failed his confirmation hearing...

517
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:38,049
and people are beginning to
mention you again.

518
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:39,460
Any comments on that?

519
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:45,630
The one thing I keep in mind
when judging a case is that...

520
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,230
within the boundaries of the law,

521
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:52,599
I must reflect how
the current society works.

522
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,039
Dad.

523
00:34:01,109 --> 00:34:04,210
The day for me to keep
my promise to you...

524
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,019
is near.

525
00:34:07,049 --> 00:34:08,719
Wait just a little longer.

526
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:12,019
I will make it happen.

527
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,000
How touching.

528
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:24,570
I'm used to seeing you
look down at people.

529
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,639
You look very displeased
to look up at something.

530
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:32,010
You think of the public as
nothing more than puppets.

531
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,579
No.

532
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,150
I never thought of them that way.

533
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:40,820
Not losing class, even when
you take off your dirty mask...

534
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,420
to show your true colors.

535
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:45,619
That's how scary you are.

536
00:34:46,059 --> 00:34:47,360
Do you still think...

537
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:51,429
I fear the revenge of
the likes of someone like you?

538
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,599
I guess...

539
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,969
there's a word that suits you
better than revenge.

540
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,639
Judgement.

541
00:35:03,739 --> 00:35:05,010
Judge Cha.

542
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:09,710
I will judge you.

543
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:12,449
Right here in Kiseong.

544
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,900
Is that Secretary Kim?

545
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:34,139
Judge Cha met who
at the country club?

546
00:35:38,809 --> 00:35:40,909
- You disapproved until now...
- Just a moment.

547
00:35:40,909 --> 00:35:42,949
because of the candidates'
lack of qualifications.

548
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:45,980
What do you think about
Judge Cha Moon Sook?

549
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:48,480
Don't you think the chief justice...

550
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:52,360
should be someone
who is fair and just?

551
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,260
Judge Cha is...

552
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:57,829
upright and spent her whole life
upholding the law.

553
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,730
I believe she has
proven herself already.

554
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:02,199
(Cha Moon Sook is verified)

555
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:05,500
She will correct the government's
twisted sense of justice.

556
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:15,550
Madam Nam.

557
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:20,550
What did Kiseong's
superstar call me for?

558
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,019
Let's have a chat.

559
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:26,360
Come over to my office.

560
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,190
I'll send a car.

561
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:31,329
It's not that I lack a ride,
I lack the heart to visit.

562
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:32,559
Bye.

563
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:35,460
I want to talk about
Prosecutor Kang.

564
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:39,199
- What?
- You'd better get here quick.

565
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:42,239
Hey, you, An Oh Ju. Hey!

566
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:43,239
(Kiseong City Hall)

567
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:46,039
If the people
want me to take office,

568
00:36:46,309 --> 00:36:48,679
I would wish to
live up to their demands.

569
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:51,409
Her goal must've been
to become chief justice.

570
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,380
She'd refused the seat
a few times before.

571
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,889
Why say yes now?

572
00:36:57,389 --> 00:36:59,590
The man Judge Cha played golf with.

573
00:37:00,289 --> 00:37:02,159
Is him, Chairman Jo Young Joon.

574
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,130
He is Minseng Party's
current leader.

575
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:06,360
Do you get it?

576
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,400
Judge Cha's goal...

577
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,269
reaches much further than
we imagined.

578
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:16,110
Cha Moon Sook and An Oh Ju
have parted ways already.

579
00:37:16,809 --> 00:37:19,340
We must use that.

580
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:23,349
It's good to see you again.

581
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:26,980
Thanks so much with your help
with the bank president.

582
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:30,289
I should thank you for
giving me a scoop.

583
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,059
What is it this time?

584
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:34,989
You called me out here...

585
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,530
which means it's much bigger
than last time.

586
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,349
Is this...

587
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,719
Judge Cha Moon Sook?

588
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:05,590
Yes, it is.

589
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:11,030
The very person who will
most likely become chief justice.

590
00:38:12,429 --> 00:38:15,199
No reporter in Kiseong
will print these photos.

591
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,400
Even outside of Kiseong.

592
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,969
That's why we
came to you, Reporter Yu.

593
00:38:20,969 --> 00:38:22,539
Do you think I'm that brave?

594
00:38:22,539 --> 00:38:24,369
Rather than bravery...

595
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:28,539
Isn't it more like a sense of duty?

596
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:31,010
This is...

597
00:38:31,949 --> 00:38:34,480
nothing at all like
the bank president deal.

598
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:38,949
I have to risk my career
and life on this.

599
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:43,559
You say that,

600
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,130
but you can't take
your eyes off the photos.

601
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,610
Speak up.

602
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:01,010
Why would you mention my daughter?

603
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,210
Look here.

604
00:39:03,849 --> 00:39:06,320
I know that Prosecutor Kang...

605
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:10,320
means more to you than
anyone in the world.

606
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,090
You're taking too long.

607
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:14,260
Judge Cha.

608
00:39:14,659 --> 00:39:17,329
When she becomes chief justice
and leaves Kiseong,

609
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:22,769
who do you think will
look after your daughter then?

610
00:39:24,769 --> 00:39:28,139
What does that have to do with you?

611
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,340
Come on now.

612
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:33,210
You should really...

613
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:35,880
try to think harder.

614
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:38,980
Come over here. Come on.

615
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:46,820
When Judge Cha...

616
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,389
leaves Kiseong,

617
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:53,099
who do you think
will be left in charge...

618
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,900
of the city?

619
00:39:55,829 --> 00:39:59,639
Kiseong will become
my city, my nest.

620
00:39:59,869 --> 00:40:01,369
"Your nest"?

621
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:12,949
Judge Cha.

622
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,519
Why come when I didn't call for you?

623
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:22,889
Get out.

624
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:28,130
Will you really become
chief justice?

625
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:30,670
What are you doing?

626
00:40:30,869 --> 00:40:34,369
What will become of
Prosecutor Kang then?

627
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,739
Will you leave Kiseong?

628
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,079
Judge Cha.

629
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,280
Don't try to find out
what I'm planning.

630
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,679
Darn it.

631
00:40:48,219 --> 00:40:49,289
We're done.

632
00:40:49,289 --> 00:40:50,949
Well done, Ms. Kim.

633
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:55,659
I can't believe you're my daughter.

634
00:40:56,389 --> 00:40:57,860
I'm dead busy.

635
00:40:58,429 --> 00:40:59,500
Must we do this?

636
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,230
Sit down over there for a bit.

637
00:41:05,769 --> 00:41:09,000
I think a huge storm is coming.

638
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:10,469
What?

639
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:12,579
You know,

640
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:15,110
I will make you someone...

641
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:18,550
who is revered until
the moment you die.

642
00:41:18,849 --> 00:41:21,650
That is the only goal of my life.

643
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:26,590
Mom, I'm doing pretty well
right now, thanks to you.

644
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:27,719
Yes, yes.

645
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:29,829
Try this.

646
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,000
You're silly.

647
00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:39,340
Keep an eye on what Judge Cha does.

648
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,800
You need to.

649
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:46,309
What will happen to
Judge Cha and Mayor An?

650
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,880
That's what's important.

651
00:41:49,309 --> 00:41:51,809
Who knows
which cloud will turn black?

652
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:54,480
Will I get drenched
or be sheltered by an umbrella?

653
00:41:56,449 --> 00:41:58,550
I should side with
the one with an umbrella.

654
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,190
Right?

655
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,829
Welcome.

656
00:42:07,429 --> 00:42:09,969
Boss, how did it go
with the reporter?

657
00:42:10,369 --> 00:42:13,000
We will get our article.

658
00:42:14,269 --> 00:42:18,269
But, an 18-year-old photo surfacing
won't bring Judge Cha down.

659
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:20,510
Won't the photos seal the deal?

660
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:23,179
Judge Cha will react in her own way.

661
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,849
We should be prepared for that.

662
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:28,679
Well, we're always ready
in mind and body...

663
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:29,719
to fight!

664
00:42:30,489 --> 00:42:31,820
Right?

665
00:42:32,019 --> 00:42:33,519
- Right!
- Right!

666
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:39,659
Judge Cha's big picture.
I'm very impressed.

667
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,559
I doubted it
even during the interview,

668
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:44,829
but you made the announcement.

669
00:42:45,869 --> 00:42:48,340
Kiseong is too small for Judge Cha.

670
00:42:48,469 --> 00:42:50,309
She should go national.

671
00:42:50,369 --> 00:42:52,269
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

672
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,750
Your recent death sentence
was very appropriate.

673
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:58,510
It's all about timing.

674
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:01,679
I always sentence criminals
according to...

675
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:03,349
my belief system.

676
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:05,349
It's not about timing.

677
00:43:05,889 --> 00:43:08,360
She accepted
the chief justice position...

678
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:10,389
and sentenced a man to death.

679
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,559
You are so impressive.

680
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,030
Congratulations.

681
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,599
Congratulations.

682
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,269
You're quiet, Madam Nam.

683
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,280
I don't see Mayor An.

684
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:39,119
Madam Nam.

685
00:43:41,289 --> 00:43:44,489
Why would you mention him
in my presence?

686
00:43:44,659 --> 00:43:45,789
I apologize, Judge Cha.

687
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:49,730
Since when did you
care so much for Mayor An?

688
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:50,769
My gosh.

689
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:53,139
I don't care for him.

690
00:43:57,610 --> 00:43:58,739
I'm leaving.

691
00:44:03,579 --> 00:44:04,679
Chief Prosecutor Jang.

692
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,320
Yes, ma'am?

693
00:44:06,579 --> 00:44:10,320
Come to my office one day.

694
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:13,320
There's someone you should meet.

695
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:18,090
Yes, ma'am.

696
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:20,059
Goodnight.

697
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:34,110
I will escort you home.

698
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:39,949
No thanks.

699
00:44:44,389 --> 00:44:45,650
- Let's drink.
- Okay.

700
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:48,860
- That's my phone.
- Why are you so busy?

701
00:44:48,989 --> 00:44:50,630
Hello there.

702
00:44:51,059 --> 00:44:53,159
It's been a while.

703
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:07,909
So, did you think about it?

704
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,679
My daughter.

705
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:12,050
Will you really look after her?

706
00:45:13,219 --> 00:45:16,090
She is all I care about.

707
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:18,289
I'm doing this because I know that.

708
00:45:19,389 --> 00:45:23,659
Cha Moon Sook will never
look after your daughter.

709
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:25,130
But you know,

710
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:29,869
An Oh Ju never turns
his back on his own.

711
00:45:30,969 --> 00:45:33,769
Once I take someone in,

712
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:38,070
I take responsibility for
whatever that person does.

713
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:39,610
I guess so.

714
00:45:57,389 --> 00:46:01,130
TVG obtained photos that
reveal what Kiseong's judge,

715
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:03,500
Cha Moon Sook, did 18 years ago.

716
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,070
These photos from
an anonymous source...

717
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:08,940
seem to show Han Cheol Kyu,

718
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:11,239
the union president of Golden City
who disappeared 18 years ago.

719
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:13,409
Everyone is reeling with shock.

720
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:28,860
Do you think this is evidence?

721
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,429
You can't even see any faces.

722
00:46:35,059 --> 00:46:36,530
Then why did you tear it?

723
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:38,929
There's a witness as well.

724
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:44,369
You did it.

725
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,309
I know nothing.

726
00:47:01,659 --> 00:47:04,030
Is it you in the car in the photo?

727
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:07,059
Are you involved in his
disappearance 18 years ago?

728
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:08,829
Judge, are you inside?

729
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:11,000
- Judge!
- Talk to us!

730
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:24,150
An Oh Ju.

731
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:27,280
How dare you?

732
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,750
Judge, are you inside?

733
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:32,219
- Judge!
- Talk to us!

734
00:47:32,219 --> 00:47:33,760
- Speak to us.
- Judge.

735
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:34,789
Judge!

736
00:47:36,789 --> 00:47:37,789
She won't come outside.

737
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:39,730
If she can't explain this,

738
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:42,130
there's no way
she'll survive the hearing.

739
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:45,030
Her plan to become chief justice
just took a direct hit.

740
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:47,969
Who's the other person
that was blurred out?

741
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:50,840
That means someone else was there.

742
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,449
(Mayor of Kiseong, An Oh Ju)

743
00:48:03,019 --> 00:48:05,489
What will happen to Judge Cha?

744
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,219
Keep an eye on the news.

745
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,489
Because you will be next.

746
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:20,739
Bong Sang Pil. You little rascal.

747
00:48:21,739 --> 00:48:26,309
With one bullet
you're trying to take two hares?

748
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:31,849
- Judge, any comments?
- Judge.

749
00:48:31,849 --> 00:48:33,079
What's your statement?

750
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:34,320
Any comments?

751
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:38,250
I have to be in court.

752
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:42,119
I will explain
my official position...

753
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:44,159
in a future press conference.

754
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:49,929
- Judge, please.
- Judge.

755
00:48:58,010 --> 00:49:01,039
Her whole life is calculated,
down to every breath.

756
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:04,610
She'll have to take off
that mask soon.

757
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:06,050
Poor Judge Cha.

758
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:10,449
(Judge Cha Remains Silent,
Who's the Other Man?)

759
00:49:10,449 --> 00:49:12,090
(Daeho Stationary)

760
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:13,159
- Nice.
- This is great.

761
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:14,659
- Well done.
- Thanks.

762
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:17,130
Attack enemies with enemies.

763
00:49:17,159 --> 00:49:20,000
- With enemies!
- With enemies!

764
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:23,369
I had no idea that was a strategy.

765
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:24,829
You're the best.

766
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:28,300
I knew nothing about this world.

767
00:49:28,369 --> 00:49:29,570
- Really?
- Really.

768
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:32,070
- Don't you feel great?
- I know I do.

769
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:34,480
What kind of a look do you think
they have on their faces?

770
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:35,510
My guess is...

771
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:37,409
Cha Moon Sook would
want to kill An Oh Ju,

772
00:49:37,409 --> 00:49:39,949
and An Oh Ju would want to kill me.

773
00:49:41,179 --> 00:49:43,050
We succeeded anyway.

774
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:44,849
All right then. Let's drink a toast.

775
00:49:44,849 --> 00:49:46,019
Let's do that.

776
00:49:46,019 --> 00:49:47,019
All right.

777
00:49:47,389 --> 00:49:49,659
Lawless Law Firm always...

778
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:52,760
- Push forward!
- Push forward!

779
00:49:53,329 --> 00:49:54,329
Let's drink.

780
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:56,300
It's so cool.

781
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:58,369
This is amazing.

782
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:07,579
Attorney Bong Sang Pil.

783
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:10,909
If you don't mind, can I
talk to you for a moment?

784
00:50:13,849 --> 00:50:15,219
Where's Attorney Ha Jae I?

785
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:17,090
I came alone today.

786
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:19,650
Please get in the car.

787
00:50:26,059 --> 00:50:28,860
The picture of Cha Moon Sook
was very helpful.

788
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:32,800
Thank you.

789
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,440
Okay.

790
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:40,039
But I won't let you help me anymore.

791
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:45,349
I don't trust anyone unless
I'm sure of their identity.

792
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:50,289
Especially people
around Cha Moon Sook.

793
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,420
There's one thing I'm worried about.

794
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:58,960
It's that Jae I trusts you.

795
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,000
That's why I came to see you.

796
00:51:07,539 --> 00:51:08,539
Please...

797
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:11,670
don't meet Jae I anymore.

798
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:15,980
Please.

799
00:51:23,389 --> 00:51:24,750
Attorney Bong Sang Pil.

800
00:51:27,389 --> 00:51:28,389
Thank you.

801
00:51:29,389 --> 00:51:31,059
For having protected my daughter.

802
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,469
Hurry.

803
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,400
Now.

804
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:45,639
Go.

805
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,039
Just go!

806
00:52:00,489 --> 00:52:02,489
What did you just say?

807
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:09,130
Huh?

808
00:52:10,769 --> 00:52:12,369
What did you say?

809
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:15,300
Jae I...

810
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:20,079
Jae I is...

811
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:22,480
your daughter?

812
00:52:25,179 --> 00:52:26,179
I know.

813
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:28,820
It's been a very long time.

814
00:52:33,489 --> 00:52:36,889
How can I know you're not lying?

815
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:39,829
How can I trust you?

816
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,670
How do you think
I met Choi Dae Woong?

817
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:48,969
How do you think I gave Jae I
Cha Moon Sook's picture?

818
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:53,340
Are you really...

819
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:55,440
Jae I's mother?

820
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,650
18 years ago,

821
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,559
you saved me.

822
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:10,289
Are you really her?

823
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:13,159
You've grown up so well.

824
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,599
You look a lot like your mother.

825
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:28,309
(Cha Moon Sook)

826
00:53:28,309 --> 00:53:32,210
(An Oh Ju)

827
00:53:41,289 --> 00:53:43,530
Who on earth sent this?

828
00:53:45,289 --> 00:53:46,389
I knew...

829
00:53:47,429 --> 00:53:48,900
Jae I and my husband...

830
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:52,170
would be in danger
if I come back to Kiseong.

831
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:54,070
So I stayed in Thailand.

832
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:55,969
We shouldn't be here. We should...

833
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:58,710
Please keep quiet
about this for a while.

834
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:00,639
I'll tell her myself.

835
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,010
I just need more time.

836
00:54:05,949 --> 00:54:07,019
Attorney Bong.

837
00:54:10,719 --> 00:54:12,650
Can you do me a favor?

838
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:15,590
Yes.

839
00:54:17,989 --> 00:54:22,030
You've been able
to protect Jae I so far.

840
00:54:22,699 --> 00:54:25,000
But she can't be
safe forever like this.

841
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:30,039
As long as she's with you...

842
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:36,210
It might sound disappointing,

843
00:54:37,349 --> 00:54:39,550
but I'm telling you this
as her mother.

844
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:43,150
I want Jae I to stay out of this.

845
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:48,260
If you really love my daughter,

846
00:54:49,289 --> 00:54:50,829
please let her go.

847
00:54:54,429 --> 00:54:56,460
I don't want to lose her ever again.

848
00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:00,099
I know I shouldn't be
asking such a thing.

849
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:02,570
But...

850
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:05,440
But this is too dangerous.

851
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:13,519
I'm sorry.

852
00:55:30,099 --> 00:55:31,170

854
00:55:37,369 --> 00:55:38,610
Have you just been released?

855
00:55:38,909 --> 00:55:40,010
It's been a few days.

856
00:55:41,239 --> 00:55:42,440
Let's go to my office.

857
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:45,510
No. I just wanted to see your face.

858
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:46,880
It must've been hard in there.

859
00:55:48,019 --> 00:55:49,019
By the way,

860
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:52,050
when were you sent to
the jail in Kiseong?

861
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:54,760
Choi Dae Woong made me go there.

862
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:57,960
He didn't give a reason though.

863
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:02,460
Then...

864
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:04,730
are you going back to Seoul?

865
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,329
I took over a business.

866
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:08,369
I'll stay in Kiseong.

867
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:10,139
In Kiseong?

868
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:14,309
I should get going.
Call me if you need help.

869
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:15,940
Okay.

870
00:56:20,619 --> 00:56:23,849
Man Bae said you were the culprit.

871
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:27,090
Do you want to know
why he's so sure...

872
00:56:28,059 --> 00:56:29,489
that I was the culprit?

873
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:31,260
Yes.

874
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:33,829
I'm curious about that, too.

875
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:38,500
Once I find the answer,

876
00:56:39,369 --> 00:56:40,739
I'll get back to you.

the picture taken 18 years ago?")

878
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:55,150

Judge Cha.

881
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:17,670
Explain the suspicions
about the picture...

882
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:18,739
or get rid of it.

883
00:57:19,739 --> 00:57:20,809
Otherwise,

884
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:23,679
I'll forget about my offer.

885
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:28,320
You're changing your ground
just because of a picture?

886
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:31,989
The picture has nothing
to do with me.

887
00:57:32,349 --> 00:57:35,820
You abandoned
my father just like this, right?

888
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:37,730
The other day,

889
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:41,059
I told you politics is
a war fought with a sword.

890
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:44,199
Why do you think they fight
with a sword?

891
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:45,429
To cut things out...

892
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:47,900
when needed.

893
00:57:49,099 --> 00:57:50,440
I'll give you one day.

with An Oh Ju for me?

901
00:59:01,739 --> 00:59:05,750

Yes. You're here early.

905

Yes.

I've always wanted to learn,
so this is great.

Today, I'll teach you
a few basic moves.

912
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:50,329
I pack some mean punches too.
Don't underestimate me.

913

You may get injured,
so take this seriously.

914

If you really love my daughter,

917
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,449
you'll let her go.

918
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:40,070
This isn't easy.

919
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,780
I'll teach you
whenever I have time...

920
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:47,750
so that you can...

921
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:49,920
easily defend yourself.

Balance...

925
01:01:33,329 --> 01:01:34,730
One step at a time.

926
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:38,170
Tighter.

933
01:01:58,090 --> 01:01:59,150
First,

934
01:01:59,719 --> 01:02:02,989
I sincerely apologize
for worrying...

935
01:02:02,989 --> 01:02:06,460
everyone in the nation
who has showed me...

936
01:02:06,659 --> 01:02:08,429
their support.

937
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:24,980
This photo is germane to
the disappearance...

938
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:27,949
of Golden City's union president
18 years ago.

939
01:02:28,519 --> 01:02:30,320
Even until recently,

940
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:34,420
this anonymously sent photo...

941
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:37,190
was used to blackmail me.

942
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:39,889
- What?
- What on earth?

943
01:02:39,889 --> 01:02:43,760
I kept it to myself, hidden,
thinking that it was...

944
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,239
only an attempt to obstruct
the Golden City project.

945
01:02:48,670 --> 01:02:49,699
However,

946
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:54,480
I now realize that the burden
shouldn't all be mine.

947
01:02:57,250 --> 01:02:58,650
I, Cha Moon Sook,

948
01:02:59,309 --> 01:03:02,579
has nothing to do with
the disappearance...

949
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:05,519
of the Golden City union president.

950
01:03:05,789 --> 01:03:07,989
That I promise you.

951
01:03:08,219 --> 01:03:09,989
- Judge!
- Of course!

What did you mean by
helping me so that...

955

Get up.

961

Judge Cha held
an urgent press conference.

962

I, Cha Moon Sook,

963
01:04:25,969 --> 01:04:29,070
will not succumb to
maligning forces.

964

I tell you now that...

965
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:33,980
I'll be officially accepting...

966
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:39,050
the candidacy of
chief justice of the Supreme Court.

967

969

Go, Judge Cha!

How dare you sentence
my son to death?

976

Who do you think you are?

977

We'll hurt them just like
they hurt my uncle.

989
01:06:07,670 --> 01:06:10,269
The Golden City project
has been put off.

990
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:12,969
Did you know that she was my mom?

991
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:15,179
Did you not tell me
so that you could use her?

992
01:06:15,309 --> 01:06:17,510
I can't trust you anymore.

993
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:21,150
In order to eliminate him,
she needed my thirst for revenge.

994
01:06:21,150 --> 01:06:22,550
Cha Moon Sook,

995
01:06:22,719 --> 01:06:23,880
she chose me.
