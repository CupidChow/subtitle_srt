(Lawless Lawyer)

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,500
Get up.

8
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,590
Boss, Attorney Ha,

9
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,820
Judge Cha held
an urgent press conference.

10
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:53,530
I'll be officially accepting...

11
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:54,530
("I will not succumb to
maligning forces.")

12
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:58,759
the candidacy of
chief justice of the Supreme Court.

13
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,540
For this country's judicial justice,

14
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,010
- I, Cha Moon Sook...
- You!

15
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,579
How dare you sentence
my son to death?

16
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:12,939
Who do you think you are?

17
00:01:14,349 --> 00:01:15,349
Judge!

18
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,920
Judge, oh no.

19
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,319
Hang in there, Judge Cha!

20
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,560
Judge!

21
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,159
Hurry. Hurry up!

22
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:27,629
Hurry.

23
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,400
The assailant turned out
to be the father...

24
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,700
of a man recently sentenced to death
by Judge Cha.

25
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,870
Because of this incident,

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,069
people will forget about
the recent photo of her.

27
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:44,079
It looks to be
a premeditated attack...

28
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,879
Who says that
people can't get lucky?

29
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,650
So far, it's either been
the law or money,

30
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,349
but now she even has
luck on her side.

31
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:54,750
Are you taking her side?

32
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,290
Of course not.

33
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:03,159
Anyway, shouldn't you
head to the hospital immediately?

34
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,459
Let's say I went.

35
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,030
Do you really think
that the lucky Judge Cha...

36
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,169
will thank me for
coming over to see her?

37
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:15,069
Still,

38
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,139
I should show my face though.

39
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,180
This is why...

40
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:26,620
being the mayor of Kiseong
is a tricky job.

41
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,389
- Sir.
- Who is it?

42
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,330
Ms. Nam, is that you?

43
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,629
Where are you?

44
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:43,400
So how's Judge Cha doing?

45
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,000
Stop fooling around
and get your butt over here!

46
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,639
I'm not deaf, you know.

47
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:51,710
I'll be there. I'm going.

48
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:57,379
The assailant turned out
to be the father of a man...

49
00:02:57,379 --> 00:02:59,180
She's done so many awful things,

50
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,050
but at least
she's getting paid for some.

51
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,819
That's right.
If you keep doing bad things,

52
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:05,689
it'll come back to haunt you.

53
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,560
Exactly. I couldn't feel better.

54
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,500
No, it's the opposite.

55
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,000
Judge went from being a suspect...

56
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,300
to a victim because of this.

57
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,900
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes?

58
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:20,169
Check the internet...

59
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,409
for videos of the incident
taken from a different angle.

60
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:24,009
- Yes, sir.
- Ones taken by bystanders.

61
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:25,009
Yes, sir.

62
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,710
You know how good he is
with his hands.

63
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,050
What?

64
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:34,120
Are you saying that
he's a member of our family?

65
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,020
How stupid are you?

66
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,560
That's not what I meant!

67
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:41,360
I'm saying that there's nothing
he can't find on the internet.

68
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:46,900
- Cha Moon Sook, Cha Moon Sook!
- Cha Moon Sook, Cha Moon Sook!

69
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,199
Mr. Mayor.

70
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:50,099
- Mr. Mayor!
- Sir.

71
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:52,270
What is Judge Cha's condition?

72
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,969
Please help Judge Cha!

73
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,439
Mr. Mayor!

74
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,439
She must be asleep.

75
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,550
Ms. Nam,

76
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:10,460
how is Judge Cha?

77
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:15,189
My heart was racing at
a million miles an hour.

78
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,730
The doctor said that...

79
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:19,029
she would've gone blind
had it hit her a few inches lower.

80
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,100
She was incredibly lucky.

81
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:23,569
My gosh.

82
00:04:23,569 --> 00:04:28,370
I mean,
I just can't believe it!

83
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,040
Goodness.

84
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,240
Mayor An.

85
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,680
Yes, Judge Cha, I'm here.

86
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,009
As the mayor,
make an official statement...

87
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:40,819
saying that I haven't regained
my consciousness yet.

88
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,360
An unconscious state?

89
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:48,730
Right, of course.

90
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,430
- Soon Ja.
- Yes, ma'am.

91
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,629
Have Editor-in-chief Han
and Chief Prosecutor Jang...

92
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,100
see me tomorrow morning.

93
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,430
Yes, ma'am.

94
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:03,310
- Run along now.
- Yes, ma'am.

95
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,579
Please get well soon.

96
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:08,079
Take good care of her.

97
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:17,519
Doesn't Judge Cha think
that you're the one...

98
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:20,589
who leaked the photos
taken 18 years ago?

99
00:05:20,829 --> 00:05:25,759
Judge Cha has put
a sharp knife to my neck.

100
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:31,800
We both are hiding
our real faces behind our masks.

101
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:34,870
If we so much
as blink the wrong way,

102
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,139
we'll be completely done for.

103
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,480
Still, I finally think
it's coming to an end.

104
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:45,980
It's the mayor!

105
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,189
- Sir!
- How is Judge Cha?

106
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:49,550
We'd like a comment.

107
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,990
I'm afraid...

108
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,990
that Judge Cha is still unconscious.

109
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,500
How will you proceed?

110
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,899
Please say something as the mayor.

111
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:01,899
Kiseong is known to be
a great city to live in...

112
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:05,240
thanks to it being one
with the lowest crime rate.

113
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,040
To know that something
this heinous happened...

114
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,939
tears me up inside.

115
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,339
I, An Oh Ju,

116
00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:15,949
as the mayor of Kiseong,

117
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:18,920
will...

118
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:23,490
punish the man responsible for this.

119
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,120
That I'll do.

120
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,959
Okay, I got one.

121
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:30,930
Here's a video taken by a bystander.

122
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:33,560
Put it up on the screen.

123
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,930
I, Cha Moon Sook...

124
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:40,040
How dare you sentence
my son to death?

125
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:41,839
Pause.

126
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:49,910
She already knew
he was coming for her.

127
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:53,720
Are you saying
she let herself get injured?

128
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:56,620
She had time to get away from him,
but she didn't.

129
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,819
She used this to her advantage.

130
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:01,959
Are you saying she made that call
in that short window of time?

131
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:05,199
She's one scary lady.
I'm shaking in horror.

132
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:08,500
I had no idea until
I joined this law firm.

133
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:10,939
The people of Kiseong
have been fooled all their lives.

134
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,939
She always thinks ahead,

135
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,839
so it's more than plausible.

136
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,639
Judge Cha...

137
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,980
is overcoming a crisis
with a crisis.

138
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:26,079
The assailant turned out
to be the father...

139
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,589
of a man recently sentenced to death
by Judge Cha.

140
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:31,790
He was arrested at the scene.

141
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,790
Meanwhile, the past
photos of Judge Cha...

142
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:38,300
are being questioned by the public
of their authenticity...

143
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,370
which adds weight to the possibility
of them being fake.

144
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,750
(Lawless Law Firm)

145
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,949
No one's talking about
Judge Cha's photos anymore.

146
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,220
I read that her followers...

147
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,459
spent the night outside
the hospital she's at,

148
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:06,759
holding candles.

149
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,759
Them and those loyal to her...

150
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,930
will help her win this game.

151
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,800
She's presided over
thousands of trials.

152
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,769
If you study them,

153
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,970
you'll see that there were crimes
beyond our comprehension.

154
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:24,509
There are even those
that seem too cruel to be true.

155
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:28,379
That experience has led to her
to know how humans operate.

156
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,250
She's now at the level where
she can manipulate others.

157
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,990
She knew what would happen...

158
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,850
if she used the attack
to her advantage.

159
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:39,519
What will her next move be then?

160
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:42,889
She went from suspect to victim,
but will she be satisfied?

161
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,529
Kwang Soo, we're heading out.

162
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:45,899
Yes, sir.

163
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,539
My gosh.

164
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,139
Judge Cha,

165
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,710
how are you doing?

166
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,580
I can't believe this.

167
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,149
It's all right. I'm fine.

168
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:06,549
- Can you help me sit up?
- Yes, of course.

169
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,590
Chief Prosecutor Jang,

170
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,490
how did you deal
with the my assailant?

171
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,159
He's in a holding cell
at the Kiseong Police Department.

172
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,100
I'll make sure he gets the maximum.

173
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,929
No, don't do anything for now.

174
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:24,539
Sorry?

175
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:27,509
Yes, ma'am.

176
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:31,580
Editor-in-chief Han,
gather some reporters.

177
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,409
Where, ma'am?

178
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:34,950
- Soon Ja.
- Yes?

179
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,710
Bring me my clothes.

180
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,649
But you're not fit enough
to be out and about.

181
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,389
What's going through your head?

182
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:46,120
Was it premeditated?

183
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,490
Do you regret your actions?

184
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:51,029
Do you have anything
to say to Judge Cha?

185
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:55,529
- Cha Moon Sook, Cha Moon Sook!
- Here she comes!

186
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:58,370
- Cha Moon Sook, Cha Moon Sook!
- Judge Cha!

187
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:59,769
- Cha Moon Sook!
- How's your injury?

188
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:01,240
Please say a few words.

189
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,639
- Cha Moon Sook!
- Cha Moon Sook!

190
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:05,210
- Judge Cha, how are you doing?
- Well...

191
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,549
This incident...

192
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,649
I understand why this happened
because of my verdict.

193
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:14,690
What exactly do you mean by that,
Judge Cha?

194
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:17,190
The sentence I issued was fair,

195
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:21,029
but his son's death penalty...

196
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:23,759
must've made him lose his reason.

197
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:26,759
I can understand how
devastated he must be as a parent.

198
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,700
Does that mean you'll forgive
the assailant?

199
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,570
Should an act
done out of parental love...

200
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,139
be legally punished?

201
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,710
I don't want him
to be punished in any way.

202
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,679
- My gosh!
- Let's give her a big hand!

203
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:45,080
I'm so sorry, Judge Cha.

204
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,590
Please forgive me.

205
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,419
Let's applaud her.

206
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:58,960
- Cha Moon Sook!
- Cha Moon Sook!

207
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,700
- Cha Moon Sook!
- Cha Moon Sook!

208
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,769
- Cha Moon Sook!
- Cha Moon Sook!

209
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:08,570
- Cha Moon Sook!
- Cha Moon Sook!

210
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,139
- Cha Moon Sook!
- Judge Cha, I have a question.

211
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:12,610
Wasn't it intentional...

212
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,210
that you didn't try to avoid
the attack?

213
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,480
- What's the matter with him?
- What's he saying?

214
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:18,879
What's his problem?

215
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,620
To me, that sounds like...

216
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,889
you're saying I intentionally
made myself the victim.

217
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:27,860
Am I right, Attorney Bong Sang Pil?

218
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,529
Yes, ma'am.

219
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:33,330
It did detract the media
and public's attention...

220
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:34,899
from the case from 18 years ago.

221
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,940
Those photos were manipulated.

222
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:45,740
- Yes!
- That's right!

223
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,110
I already gave my answers...

224
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,679
at the press conference.
No more questions, please.

225
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,889
- Cha Moon Sook!
- Cha Moon Sook!

226
00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:58,820
- Cha Moon Sook!
- Cha Moon Sook!

227
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,659
- Cha Moon Sook!
- Cha Moon Sook!

228
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:03,429
- Cha Moon Sook!
- Cha Moon Sook!

229
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:05,230
People will go on about
how kind and forgiving she is.

230
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,399
She managed to turn
a crisis into an opportunity.

231
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,100
- Cha Moon Sook!
- Cha Moon Sook!

232
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,100
You accurately predicted her move.

233
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,809
I'm going back to the office.
You can call it a day.

234
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,480
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

235
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:25,850
Let's go.

236
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,990
We hope she can recover
and return to court very soon.

237
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:32,659
- We're rooting for you, Judge Cha!
- We're here for you!

238
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,269
I'll teach you
whenever we have time...

239
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,570
so that you can be fine on your own.

240
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,980
Gosh, you startled me.

241
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,950
You didn't even hear me coming in?

242
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,490
What were you thinking about?

243
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:02,750
What brings you here?

244
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,659
I bought all this on my way home,
but it's too much food for me,

245
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:07,889
so I stopped by to eat with you.

246
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:09,730
- Come on in.
- All right.

247
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,330
Oh, my gosh.

248
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,429
Attorney Bong has gone back
into his cave, hasn't he?

249
00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:19,639
- Geum Ja.
- I know what's going on.

250
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,710
You see, men do that sometimes.

251
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:25,379
What should you do
when that happens?

252
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:29,450
Don't do anything.
Just give him some time and space.

253
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:30,750
Well...

254
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:35,149
My dad has no idea what kind
of person Cha Moon Sook really is,

255
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,889
and Attorney Bong feels...

256
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,519
like he's distancing himself
from me.

257
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:42,929
Well... As for your father,

258
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:46,299
he'll find out the truth about her
with time,

259
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:47,899
so I don't think
you should be worried.

260
00:13:48,669 --> 00:13:50,799
I can't figure out
what Attorney Bong is thinking.

261
00:13:51,669 --> 00:13:53,500
Are you trying to upset me
or what?

262
00:13:55,409 --> 00:13:57,110
Just leave him alone.

263
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,080
Leave him be
until he walks out of his cave.

264
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:01,610
Geum Ja, you're like a dating coach.

265
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:04,620
To be honest, I'm a little jealous.

266
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,519
But what can I do?
You two look so cute together.

267
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:11,419
So cheer up, please. Okay?

268
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,490
- Okay, I will.
- And eat more too.

269
00:14:20,429 --> 00:14:23,370
I have the right to know more
about you,

270
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:25,740
because you're my man.

271
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,710
If you really love my daughter,

272
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,309
please let her go.

273
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,750
Boss, did you want to see me?

274
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,889
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes, Boss.

275
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,559
Jae I's mother...

276
00:14:46,289 --> 00:14:48,090
- is alive.
- Sorry?

277
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,129
Are you sure?

278
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,799
Yes.

279
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:55,570
Does Attorney Ha know about it too?

280
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:59,039
Her mother asked me to keep it from
her for now, so I haven't told her.

281
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,710
Don't tell her
until I tell her myself.

282
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,649
Okay, Boss.

283
00:15:22,659 --> 00:15:24,559
You told me to end it with Jae I.

284
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,529
I'll do as you say.

285
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:29,570
Okay.

286
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,940
But there's one thing
I'd like to ask you.

287
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:43,509
This notebook.

288
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:45,980
You sent me this, didn't you?

289
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:57,029
(Cha Moon Sook)

290
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,299
(An Oh Ju)

291
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,200
No, it wasn't me.

292
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,539
Pardon?

293
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:12,110
You're not the one who sent me this?

294
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,980
That's right.

295
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,690
So, you're in Mr. Jo's family.

296
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:28,960
What a small world.

297
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,500
I'd love to brag about it,

298
00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:35,929
but he'll yell at me if I do that.

299
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,570
This is for you.

300
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,370
Mr. Jo sent this
to congratulate you...

301
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,279
on your recovery.

302
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,549
It's a set that consists of a brush
and an inkstone traditionally...

303
00:16:50,549 --> 00:16:53,250
- used by Chinese kings.
- My gosh.

304
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,519
This was my father's favorite thing.

305
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,919
The public opinion about you
has completely shifted.

306
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,629
And your decision
helped him further solidify...

307
00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:05,059
his position within the party.

308
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:09,029
I just do what I think is right,
that's all.

309
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:10,569
I know, of course.

310
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:12,700
Whenever I talk to him,

311
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:15,140
I praise you
like there's no tomorrow.

312
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,250
Oh, Chief Prosecutor Jang.
Come on in.

313
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,079
I see that you have a guest.

314
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,490
I've heard a lot about you,
Chief Prosecutor Jang Sa Ik.

315
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,720
It's nice to meet you.

316
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,390
Chief Prosecutor Jang and I...

317
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,329
will work very closely together
from now on.

318
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:38,160
Let Mr. Jo know.

319
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:40,359
Sure, I will.

320
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:46,869
You tell him.
Why do I have to tell him?

321
00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:49,569
- It's...
- Make me a cup of tea.

322
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:51,509
What brings you here?

323
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,779
Hello, sir.

324
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:54,240
- What's up?
- The thing is...

325
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,319
Whenever you guys are
all fidgety like this,

326
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:02,319
things that drive me up
the wall happen.

327
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:04,190
Tell me. What is going on?

328
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:06,259
What's the matter? Just tell me.

329
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,660
Well...

330
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:10,190
You should see this, sir.

331
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,500
("Ministry of Construction Puts
the Golden City Project on Hold")

332
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,609
Good grief.

333
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,609
- Hey, you.
- Yes, sir.

334
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:29,049
What is your job? Answer me.

335
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:32,480
You couldn't stop them before they
published this ridiculous article?

336
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,180
Why are you even here?

337
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,920
It's not just the article, sir.

338
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:39,059
It's actually happening.
The project has been put on hold.

339
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:41,690
Put on hold?

340
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:45,930
- Hey, come here. Get over here!
- Yes, sir.

341
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,670
- Call Attorney Go In Du now.
- Got it, sir.

342
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,940
Hey, I signed all the papers
and sent them in.

343
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,940
What's the problem?
Why was it put on hold?

344
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,809
The Ministry of Construction wants
to go over some legal issues.

345
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:03,079
Judge Cha has already
sorted that all out.

346
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:04,950
I think that's the problem, sir.

347
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:08,619
It looks like she has
decided against the project.

348
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,450
What?

349
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,359
- She's not answering our calls.
- She's decided against it?

350
00:19:25,069 --> 00:19:27,910
You didn't answer my calls.
What on earth are you doing here?

351
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:29,970
Answer me!

352
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:35,049
Judge Cha and I were
discussing an important matter.

353
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:39,349
I asked you to go over all the legal
issues with the Golden City...

354
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,990
a long time ago.

355
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,819
What have you been doing?

356
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:47,559
Read the newspapers, will you?

357
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,890
The project has been put on hold.

358
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,160
I know you have no interest
in the civic matters, but...

359
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,930
Take your fight outside.

360
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:03,539
I worked so hard
to make sure all pieces of land...

361
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:05,380
that you own
under other people's names,

362
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:07,140
would be included
in the Golden City project.

363
00:20:08,349 --> 00:20:10,450
Do you know how
much trouble it caused?

364
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,480
Even though you're aware of that,

365
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:16,690
instead of awarding me for it,

366
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:19,519
you put on the breaks before...

367
00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:21,730
I even got started.

368
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:23,890
I see you're well aware.

369
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,559
It's just like you said.

370
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,099
I only suspended the project because
it could cause trouble later.

371
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,339
What did you just say?

372
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,769
The Golden City...

373
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,480
was my promise
to the people as mayor.

374
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,509
Your promise?

375
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:44,509
That's a joke even
a dog would bark at.

376
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,450
It's not like you became mayor
all on your own.

377
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,759
Judge Cha,

378
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:06,799
are you trying to ostracize me
now that you...

379
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,509
swallowed Ohju Group up in one bite?

380
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:15,410
Wasn't donating Ohju Group
to the city of Kiseong...

381
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,650
a promise you made as well?

382
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:22,250
It's the same as promising me
the entire company.

383
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,960
You. Hey, you.

384
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,759
Have you and Judge Cha
been fornicating...

385
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,660
behind my back?

386
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,609
Hey. Hey. Hey!

387
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:45,339
It's "communicating",
not fornicating.

388
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:47,779
You idiot.

389
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,859
Let's say the dog you raised...

390
00:22:04,829 --> 00:22:07,930
suddenly came
and bit you in the neck.

391
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,769
At that moment,

392
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:16,109
there would be nothing you could do.

393
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:26,849
I, An Oh Ju,

394
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,950
have been following
your orders all this time.

395
00:22:32,589 --> 00:22:33,660
However,

396
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,400
I won't anymore.

397
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:43,869
Now I'll do it my way.

398
00:22:46,269 --> 00:22:48,109
I'm going to do whatever I want.

399
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:50,539
You wait and see.

400
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:08,859
I said I got it.
You know who I am, don't you?

401
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:13,829
Mayor An will solve everything.

402
00:23:13,829 --> 00:23:14,900
Okay, bye.

403
00:23:18,339 --> 00:23:20,069
Sir, well...

404
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:25,980
my brother-in-law wants to
put up a building in Kiseong,

405
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:28,309
but City Hall is being
annoyingly meticulous.

406
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,779
If you could put in a good word...

407
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:32,880
Stop the car.

408
00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:34,920
Sorry?

409
00:23:38,259 --> 00:23:40,559
Stop the car, you idiot.

410
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,630
Has being...

411
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,329
my tag-along,

412
00:23:48,329 --> 00:23:50,930
made you want to
order me around too?

413
00:23:52,369 --> 00:23:54,269
No, I wouldn't dare...

414
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,480
You weasel.

415
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:03,880
Does City Hall seem
that easy to you?

416
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:07,019
Am I your underling?

417
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:09,490
Am I supposed to clear up your mess?

418
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,119
You idiot. You piece of scum!

419
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:16,190
You, wait right there.

420
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,299
Sir, I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry!

421
00:24:23,569 --> 00:24:25,640
I was wrong. I'm so sorry!

422
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:27,170
I was wrong.

423
00:24:27,869 --> 00:24:29,869
I'm so sorry, sir.

424
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:33,109
Don't you dare ask for anything
like this again.

425
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:35,380
I won't.

426
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,450
Know that this is your last chance.

427
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:40,549
Do this again,

428
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,720
and you'll disappear into oblivion!

429
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:55,369
The notebook wasn't from
Attorney Ha's mother?

430
00:24:56,869 --> 00:24:57,930
No.

431
00:24:58,269 --> 00:24:59,769
Then who sent it?

432
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:02,839
Who could it be?

433
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,740
I need to know.

434
00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:11,579
Does that mean
you have someone in mind?

435
00:25:12,349 --> 00:25:14,890
- I know.
- Wasn't she pretty?

436
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:16,619
Why are you so late?

437
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:18,619
We went out for lunch.

438
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,690
We ate so fast that
we almost burned our throats.

439
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:25,859
- Attorney Ha isn't back either.
- You're right.

440
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,970
- It'll be just us this time.
- Sorry?

441
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,500
We're doing it the old way.

442
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:33,099
Wait.

443
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:35,509
Who are we going after the old way?

444
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:36,970
Seok Gwan Dong.

445
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:40,079
Seok Gwan Dong, that scum.
He's dead meat.

446
00:25:40,109 --> 00:25:41,210
Are you all ready?

447
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,279
- Yes!
- Are you ready?

448
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:43,509
- Yes!
- Let's go!

449
00:25:44,049 --> 00:25:46,319
He's the one who murdered my uncle.

450
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:51,289
This time, our job is to
erase him for existence.

451
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:57,089
I'll do to him
what he did to my uncle.

452
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,529
Do you mean that...

453
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:02,799
Are you willing to get
blood on your hands?

454
00:26:06,769 --> 00:26:10,210
"Mr. Aide, please have a drink."
Say that.

455
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:14,079
Gwan Dong, you're out of booze.

456
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,950
Is that so? All the booze is gone?

457
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:21,380
If that's the case, get some more!

458
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:24,650
Here's your money. Take this.

459
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,759
What are you doing?

460
00:26:25,789 --> 00:26:27,119
Stop it!

461
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,119
Have you lost it?

462
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,690
I gave you money,
so bring me my booze!

463
00:26:33,829 --> 00:26:37,470
An Oh Ju, you gangster punk.

464
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,769
I'm Seok Gwan Dong, you jerk.

465
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:44,640
Gwan Dong, it's been a while.

466
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:49,109
Bong Sang Pil, is that you?

467
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,980
What brings you here?

468
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:55,349
What's with the pity party?

469
00:26:55,589 --> 00:26:57,450
Is this how you blow off steam?

470
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:00,220
What the heck did I do?

471
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:02,059
Kwang Soo.

472
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,859
Cheer Gwan Dong up.

473
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,700
Yes, sir.

474
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,130
I'll come to you.

475
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:12,970
Here, look. I'm coming.

476
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:15,670
See? Just look at me.

477
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:17,670
What now?

478
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,279
Gwan Dong.

479
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:24,910
Bong Sang Pil, you freak.

480
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,779
Look forward to it.

481
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,750
What? You idiot.

482
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,289
You...

483
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:43,230
- Sir, oh gosh. Take him out, guys.
- Yes, sir!

484
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,970
Don't take
too much care of him though.

485
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:48,299
Drop him if you want.
He's barely human anyway.

486
00:27:48,569 --> 00:27:50,369
Don't worry about carrying him.

487
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:52,380
It's okay to even drag him.

488
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,410
Bring him here. Over here.

489
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:56,609
Get him inside.

490
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,750
- Gosh.
- Push him in.

491
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:11,859
Is he still asleep?
Gwan Dong, wake up already.

492
00:28:12,259 --> 00:28:14,759
Wake up. Wake up!

493
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:15,930
He's up.

494
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,500
What?

495
00:28:19,069 --> 00:28:20,170
What is this?

496
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:23,240
Where do you think you are?

497
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,779
You're Bong Sang Pil, aren't you?

498
00:28:26,809 --> 00:28:28,579
What do you think you're doing?

499
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,009
- Let me down!
- Let you down?

500
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:37,119
If I do,
you'll fall down 10 stories.

501
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:38,490
Should I let you down?

502
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,029
- Gwan Dong.
- It's actually 15 stories.

503
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:44,029
- Goodness.
- Hey!

504
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:47,500
You worthless jerks.
I know you're lying.

505
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,529
Where am I? What is this place?

506
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:52,440
Fine. Drop him a few inches.

507
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,440
- More.
- Stop!

508
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:01,640
Gwan Dong.

509
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:07,819
I'll do to you...

510
00:29:09,089 --> 00:29:11,119
what you did to my uncle.

511
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:12,160
What?

512
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:15,859
Are you saying we're at the rooftop?

513
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:17,890
Hey.

514
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:21,059
What did you do after...

515
00:29:22,069 --> 00:29:23,329
you hung my uncle from the roof?

516
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,569
Answer me.

517
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:33,809
Answer me if you don't
want to fall to your death.

518
00:29:34,009 --> 00:29:35,950
What did you do next?

519
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:38,109
We stabbed him. We stabbed him!

520
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,420
He was stabbed,

521
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:42,349
but it wasn't me. It wasn't me!

522
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,220
Bring me a knife.

523
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,660
- What? No!
- Here you go.

524
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,460
I'm sorry. Gosh, I'm sorry.

525
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,059
Sang Pil, please. I'm sorry.

526
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:53,630
So you stabbed him first.
Then what?

527
00:29:54,829 --> 00:29:56,569
Then you hung him off the rooftop.

528
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,599
All we need to do now
is untie his hands.

529
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:03,009
Like this. Right?

530
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,509
No, don't!

531
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:10,849
Remember what you guys did
to my uncle?

532
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:14,420
I'm going to do it
to you guys today.

533
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:17,519
Is Mr. Seok not here yet?

534
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:19,789
No, sir. We tried to call him,
but his phone is off.

535
00:30:19,789 --> 00:30:20,819
Okay.

536
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:31,069
Hey, Secretary Kim?

537
00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:34,140
- Lower it.
- Hurry up.

538
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,279
Bong Sang Pil!

539
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,509
Why are you doing this to me?

540
00:30:43,549 --> 00:30:47,680
It's not like I wanted to do it.
You're well aware of that.

541
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:53,190
I just did what An Oh Ju
ordered me to do.

542
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,890
Do you actually expect me
to believe you?

543
00:30:56,529 --> 00:30:57,930
I mean, it's you.

544
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,759
Shouldn't you know yourself
better?

545
00:31:00,029 --> 00:31:01,029
Evidence.

546
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:02,829
I have evidence to prove it.

547
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:07,339
I recorded everything in case
An Oh Ju dumps everything on me.

548
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:11,109
They're on my phone.
Please believe me.

549
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,349
- Don't kill me, please.
- Stay still,

550
00:31:15,349 --> 00:31:16,509
or you'll get hurt.

551
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,250
Another analog method.

552
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:21,180
That worked.

553
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:26,319
I know you want to get back at me,
but you got the wrong person.

554
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,390
You should get back at An Oh Ju.

555
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:33,660
But still, what you did
cannot be forgiven.

556
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,200
Gwan Dong.

557
00:31:36,099 --> 00:31:37,130
Goodbye.

558
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,799
Please, no. Please.

559
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:40,799
Hey, cut it.

560
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,640
- Okay, Boss.
- Wait, no!

561
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:58,349
Gosh, I'm in so much pain...

562
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,690
I'd love to kill you
with my own two hands,

563
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,000
but An Oh Ju will probably
take care of you in my place.

564
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,670
You know that he's
very different from me, right?

565
00:32:14,869 --> 00:32:15,869
Let's go, guys.

566
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,140
- Yes, Boss.
- Yes, Boss.

567
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,180
Goodbye, Seok Gwan Dong.

568
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:23,079
Let's go.

569
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,980
By the way, how is he going
to get back up here?

570
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,789
You heartless punks.

571
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:30,789
- Give him a bottle of water.
- Got it.

572
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:31,789
- Okay.
- Good.

573
00:32:31,789 --> 00:32:33,890
- Enjoy your water.
- I hope the water cheers you up.

574
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,329
We're off.

575
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:37,430
- Let's go.
- All right.

576
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,859
No, don't leave me here...

577
00:32:45,069 --> 00:32:46,799
Do a good job with editing
what we recorded today.

578
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,309
- Okay, Boss.
- What should we do with his phone?

579
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:53,880
Look through everything on it,
especially things about An Oh Ju.

580
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,250
We'll make sure not to miss
a single thing about An Oh Ju.

581
00:32:56,779 --> 00:32:58,309
You know the drill.

582
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,119
You sure trained me well.

583
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,150
Who should be the first
to hear this great news?

584
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,089
The answer is obvious.

585
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:10,559
Let's go, guys!

586
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,400
- Yes, Boss!
- Let's go!

587
00:33:16,099 --> 00:33:18,769
What's... What's happening?

588
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:23,240
Why was the Golden City project
put on hold? What's going on?

589
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,170
Gosh, I heard you.
Just have a seat, woman.

590
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,710
Just tell me already!

591
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:30,279
They say it's easy to miss
what's right in front of you.

592
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:31,579
Madam Nam.

593
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:35,519
You didn't know when you work
so closely with Cha Moon Sook?

594
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:37,890
Goodness!

595
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:41,660
My money! Gosh, my money...

596
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:45,359
Enough! Stop talking
about your money, will you?

597
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,500
I get so upset when I start
thinking about how much I'll lose.

598
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:51,769
Gosh, what should I do now?

599
00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:55,670
What should we do, Mayor An?

600
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:56,769
Goodness.

601
00:33:58,509 --> 00:34:01,539
I asked you to come and meet me,
thinking you'd know more than I do,

602
00:34:02,809 --> 00:34:04,480
but it doesn't seem to be the case.

603
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,059
If I can get my money back,

604
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:20,530
I can do anything with you.

605
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,369
Is that so?

606
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,900
You and I are similar in that way.

607
00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:29,869
You can't go in there.

608
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:31,809
- Get out of my way.
- I said you can't go in!

609
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,840
- Let go.
- What's going on?

610
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:36,980
That's Bong Sang Pil.

611
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:38,780
An Oh Ju!

612
00:34:46,019 --> 00:34:47,219
Hey, An Oh Ju.

613
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:51,659
I'm here to deliver
great news to you.

614
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:55,130
Look who's here.

615
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,699
Aren't you...

616
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,599
the infamous butler, Nam Soon Ja?

617
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,869
What? "Butler"?

618
00:35:04,409 --> 00:35:05,809
You little...

619
00:35:05,809 --> 00:35:07,579
- How dare you.
- From what I know,

620
00:35:07,579 --> 00:35:11,179
you two can't be chatting like this.

621
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:14,119
Is Cha Moon Sook aware of this?

622
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,150
The fact that you two met up.

623
00:35:16,219 --> 00:35:19,559
You rude punk.
Shut your trap, will you?

624
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:21,659
I'm glad I came in person
to deliver the news to you.

625
00:35:23,059 --> 00:35:24,929
I got to find out
that you two are actually close.

626
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:27,159
This is getting interesting.

627
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,170
Actually, I'm just realizing...

628
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,900
that Seok Gwan Dong isn't here.

629
00:35:36,139 --> 00:35:37,269
Aren't you curious?

630
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:44,610
Why are you asking me...

631
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,380
about Gwan Dong?

632
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:49,849
You'll find out the details
through the news tomorrow.

633
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,289
Look forward to it.

634
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:55,789
It'll be a very special gift.

635
00:36:02,699 --> 00:36:06,800
I'll kindly inform Judge Cha
about your relationship later on.

636
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,869
That crazy punk.
What's he saying now?

637
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:11,309
Hey, peddler.

638
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:15,750
My gosh!

639
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,869
If you keep...

640
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,469
roaming around as you please,

641
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:47,610
I'm going to shoot a bullet
into your head.

642
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,710
You got that?

643
00:37:15,809 --> 00:37:17,769
Nice! Awesome!

644
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:19,809
We did it!

645
00:37:20,309 --> 00:37:21,639
What?
Did you guys find something?

646
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:22,809
Boss, you're back.

647
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,849
Boss, we just finished going
through Seok Gwan Dong's phone.

648
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:26,849
- Really?
- Yes.

649
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,449
He didn't lie to us, did he?

650
00:37:28,449 --> 00:37:29,949
No, he told us the truth this time.

651
00:37:29,949 --> 00:37:32,090
His phone will be invaluable to us.

652
00:37:32,219 --> 00:37:33,219
Take a look at this.

653
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,289
You see,

654
00:37:35,289 --> 00:37:39,659
I'm holding two trump cards
in my hand now.

655
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,760
I just have to decide...

656
00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:45,800
which one to use
and what to get in return.

657
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:49,369
Yes. You're absolutely right, sir.

658
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:51,440
Let's start with Choi Dae Woong.

659
00:37:51,809 --> 00:37:53,440
How many of his guys did he bring?

660
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:56,250
Just one, sir.

661
00:37:56,409 --> 00:37:59,019
I heard that he's very brave.

662
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:01,050
He sure is gutsy.

663
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,789
Did he come alone
to protect his guys?

664
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,219
Anyway,

665
00:38:07,289 --> 00:38:09,730
it seems like
the universe is helping me.

666
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:11,690
Go there now.

667
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:14,699
That scum, Choi Dae Woong,
should be...

668
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,900
Yes, sir.

669
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:21,469
An Oh Ju's face and voice.
This is concrete proof.

670
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,070
I'll send this and Seok Gwan Dong's
recordings to the prosecutor.

671
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,579
- Don't.
- Sorry?

672
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:31,349
Let's disseminate them
on the Internet first.

673
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:35,480
I told you that we must find out
who the notebook belongs to.

674
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,619
Yes, you said that.

675
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,360
That's what we have to do...

676
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,489
before we take An Oh Ju to court.

677
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,590
Got it, Boss.

678
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:44,889
- Follow me.
- Okay.

679
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:46,030
See you later, Boss.

680
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:08,679
Hey, have you found out
where Gwan Dong could be?

681
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,320
I found his car parked
outside a lounge in Kiseong,

682
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:13,219
and after reviewing
the security camera footage,

683
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:15,590
it looks like
it was Bong Sang Pil's doing.

684
00:39:15,889 --> 00:39:17,789
It was Bong Sang Pil?

685
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,860
All right.

686
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:27,469
Sir, you should watch the news.

687
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:30,639
- Put it on.
- Yes, sir.

688
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,550
A video, which shows Mayor An Oh Ju
soliciting to murder,

689
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:40,519
has been causing controversy
since it was posted on the Internet.

690
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:43,250
A shocking video clip that shows
a man, who is speculated to be...

691
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,989
Mayor An Oh Ju,
ordering to kill Choi Dae Woong...

692
00:39:45,989 --> 00:39:49,360
was posted on a website
earlier today.

693
00:39:49,489 --> 00:39:52,090
Also, a voice recording
of a man admitting...

694
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:54,400
Mayor An's solicitation of murder
was posted as well,

695
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,670
which will further ignite
the controversy.

696
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,909
It's not like I wanted to do it.
You're well aware of that.

697
00:40:03,909 --> 00:40:05,110
My gosh, what's this?

698
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:07,480
What do you think?
It's Gwan Dong's voice.

699
00:40:07,909 --> 00:40:09,550
- Who did this?
- I did.

700
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,550
Did you?

701
00:40:10,849 --> 00:40:12,949
- Gosh.
- You did great.

702
00:40:12,949 --> 00:40:14,280
What a beautiful sound.

703
00:40:14,349 --> 00:40:15,949
- Hi, Attorney Ha.
- Hi.

704
00:40:15,949 --> 00:40:17,519
We got him good.

705
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:19,760
Why didn't you tell me?

706
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:21,989
I was going to later.

707
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:26,130
Attorney Bong, follow me outside.

708
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,619
What's up with you?

709
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,789
What's this with the mayor?

710
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,289
Why didn't you tell me?

711
00:40:56,489 --> 00:40:59,260
- Jae I.
- Weren't we working together?

712
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:05,369
Is there something I can't know?

713
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,809
I'm sorry.

714
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,579
Right now,

715
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:16,349
there's nothing I can tell you.

716
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:38,130
A video file of Mayor An
instigating murder...

717
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:39,769
Chief Prosecutor Jang, welcome.

718
00:41:39,769 --> 00:41:41,369
It caused an uproar.

719
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,210
A voice believed to belong to...

720
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:45,269
- You asked for me?
- Mayor An...

721
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:46,909
- Welcome.
- Ordering a murder...

722
00:41:46,909 --> 00:41:50,050
surfaced on the internet today,
causing a stir.

723
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:53,219
He acted like a total lunatic.

724
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,780
I knew this would happen.

725
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:59,690
It looks like more trouble for you.

726
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:01,690
A mad dog...

727
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:06,230
should be shot and maimed
before it bites.

728
00:42:09,469 --> 00:42:12,570
Make sure to break
An Oh Ju completely.

729
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,489
(Mayor An Oh Ju's Campaign Funds)

730
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:40,760
You just have to follow my lead.

731
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:45,070
I should surround myself
with people that look the part.

732
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:51,070
Bong Sang Pil,
that nutcase of a jerk.

733
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:53,510
Should I just crush him dead?

734
00:42:58,210 --> 00:42:59,449
Secretary Kim.

735
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:00,719
Yes, sir.

736
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:05,119
Find Seok Gwan Dong this instant.

737
00:43:06,889 --> 00:43:11,389
Search every little
rat hole you can find.

738
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,059
Do it now.

739
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:19,739
- She has a temper.
- Right.

740
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:22,500
- Hello.
- Where's Attorney Bong?

741
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,769
Attorney Ha.

742
00:43:24,309 --> 00:43:25,710
Is something wrong?

743
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:30,110
- Did Cha Moon Sook...
- No.

744
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:33,250
That's good to hear.

745
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:35,219
Can you spare me some time today?

746
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,250
Could we have lunch together?

747
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:40,960
Of course. I'll book a place.

748
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:43,130
Bye.

749
00:44:01,579 --> 00:44:03,309
It's nicer seeing you here.

750
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:05,309
- Please sit.
- Okay.

751
00:44:10,489 --> 00:44:14,019
I chose this restaurant because
you're from Thailand. Is that okay?

752
00:44:15,389 --> 00:44:16,730
I'll eat anything.

753
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:42,650
How long did you live in Thailand?

754
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:44,690
Were you born there?

755
00:44:46,289 --> 00:44:47,619
I was there a long time.

756
00:44:48,489 --> 00:44:49,690
A very long time.

757
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,760
Where do you stay now?

758
00:44:53,929 --> 00:44:55,400
This is on the house.

759
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:58,170
Thank you.

760
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,099
In the motel alley
opposite the station.

761
00:45:02,269 --> 00:45:03,610
I see.

762
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:08,679
Eat up.

763
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:11,050
You too.

764
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:30,699
What's wrong?

765
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:33,840
Are you okay?

766
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:39,110
Jae I. Jae I.

767
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,940
What's the matter?

768
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:47,250
Shrimp. You're allergic to shrimp.

769
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:49,449
There's shrimp?

770
00:45:49,449 --> 00:45:52,389
- Call for an ambulance. Now.
- Okay.

771
00:45:53,559 --> 00:45:54,659
Jae I.

772
00:45:56,329 --> 00:45:58,929
How do you know
I'm allergic to shrimp?

773
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,739
(Madam Nam)

774
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:13,880
Get her an ambulance.

775
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,550
Are you all right?

776
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,750
Drink some water.

777
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:29,090
Yes.

778
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:30,590
To the left.

779
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:33,659
Don't look at me.
Look at the camera.

780
00:46:33,659 --> 00:46:34,960
If you don't mind,

781
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,369
can I have your name?

782
00:46:38,699 --> 00:46:39,869
Mama.

783
00:46:42,369 --> 00:46:43,369
Mama?

784
00:46:45,539 --> 00:46:47,380
I'll come right now.

785
00:46:57,219 --> 00:46:58,719
(Jae I)

786
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:05,489
I'm sorry I left...

787
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,099
so abruptly.

788
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,199
Are you okay?

789
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:17,739
Hello?

790
00:47:20,039 --> 00:47:21,380
Attorney Ha.

791
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:26,110
No one knows...

792
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:29,750
I'm allergic to shrimp.

793
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:33,460
No one but my mom.

794
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:51,269
Mom.

795
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:11,289
I'm in Cha Moon Sook's
residence right now.

796
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:17,730
I'm going out.

797
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:20,539
- Okay.
- Shall we come too?

798
00:48:21,739 --> 00:48:23,510
- He's up to something.
- Yes.

799
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:25,869
- What could it be?
- I don't know.

800
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:29,110
Judge, your masseuse is here.

801
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:33,480
I will get ready...

802
00:49:34,809 --> 00:49:36,480
while you drink your tea.

803
00:50:10,949 --> 00:50:12,710
I don't want any tea.

804
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,329
I'll start at the neck.

805
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:38,210
You.

806
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:44,110
How long do you think
I'll put up with your spying?

807
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:48,050
The man who saved you must've...

808
00:50:48,219 --> 00:50:50,519
warned you never to
return to Kiseong.

809
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,349
Cha Moon Sook.

810
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:56,289
Do you...

811
00:50:57,789 --> 00:51:00,900
Do you know what kind of life
I had because of you?

812
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:05,469
For 18 long years... I...

813
00:51:05,469 --> 00:51:07,639
Yes. Exactly.

814
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:10,670
You should've accepted your fate.

815
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:14,210
What? I should've what?

816
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:15,440
Madam Nam.

817
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,610
You're pure evil.

818
00:51:16,909 --> 00:51:19,650
You lunatic. Put that down!

819
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:20,849
How dare you?

820
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:24,090
Get in here and drag her out!

821
00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:25,119
Get her out.

822
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:26,460
- Cha Moon Sook.
- You psycho.

823
00:51:26,889 --> 00:51:28,590
- Have you lost your mind?
- Cha Moon Sook.

824
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:30,230
Are you okay, Judge?

825
00:51:30,489 --> 00:51:32,030
She's crazy.

826
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:34,230
My goodness. Judge.

827
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:38,099
Judge. Judge.

828
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:40,500
- Is she okay?
- Hurry, get some water.

829
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,099
(Inn)

830
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:45,239
In the motel alley
opposite the station.

831
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:10,230
I think...

832
00:52:12,199 --> 00:52:14,500
Cha Moon Sook
already knows who you are.

833
00:52:14,769 --> 00:52:16,469
You can't go in there again.

834
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:18,610
No.

835
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,179
Let's use the situation.

836
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:27,550
You want to reveal who you are?

837
00:52:27,949 --> 00:52:31,019
Madam Nam got me the job.

838
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:33,260
Let's give Cha Moon Sook...

839
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:35,760
a reason to get rid of Madam Nam.

840
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:38,760
No, you can't do that.
It's too dangerous.

841
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:42,559
I risked everything
when I became her masseuse.

842
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:44,929
I would do even worse.

843

850
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:34,119
Did you...

851
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,349
know already?

852
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,889
That she's my mom?

853
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:44,360
- Jae I, I...
- You knew...

854
00:53:45,929 --> 00:53:48,159
all along and didn't tell me?

855
00:53:51,699 --> 00:53:53,539
How could you do that to me?

856
00:53:55,469 --> 00:53:57,039
How could you hide that?

857
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,280
Jae I. Ha Jae I!

858
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:06,409
The phone was turned off.
Please leave a message...

859
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:08,849
- Jae I.
- A fee will be incurred.

860
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,019
Her phone's been off for a while.

861
00:54:11,719 --> 00:54:13,860

Cha Moon Sook. Tell me.

868

Where'd you take my mom?

869
00:54:53,159 --> 00:54:55,230
This thing called family.

870
00:54:56,599 --> 00:54:58,269
It turns people into fools.

871
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:01,699
Look at you and your mom.

872
00:55:02,369 --> 00:55:03,440
What?

873
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:05,409
Yes.

874
00:55:06,039 --> 00:55:07,909
I know what it's like.

875
00:55:07,909 --> 00:55:10,610
That's why
I didn't have a family of my own.

876
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:13,380
A family becomes
a lifelong weakness...

that you can never get rid of.

878

Just like you now.

Stop talking nonsense,
Cha Moon Sook.

880
00:55:22,489 --> 00:55:23,559
You will never know...

881
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:26,460
what a family means.

885
00:55:40,309 --> 00:55:42,039
- Take her!
- Yes, ma'am.

886
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:43,550
Let go!

887

Let go. Let go!

890
00:55:57,730 --> 00:55:59,159
I'll take her away.

She's very agitated.

894
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:08,539
Escort her well.

895
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:11,440
- Where's my mom?
- Let's go for now.

896
00:56:14,179 --> 00:56:15,840
- Where's my mom?
- Ha Jae I!

897

Jae I.

900
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,900
Did you not tell me...

901
00:56:38,969 --> 00:56:41,170
so you could use her
to get your revenge?

902
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:48,710
Nothing you can say...

903
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,210
will make me tell you anything.

904
00:56:55,050 --> 00:56:56,750
I can't forgive you.

905
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:00,860
It was all for revenge.

906
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:03,289
You watched me...

907
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:06,329
and brought me to your firm.

908

909
00:57:10,769 --> 00:57:14,599
Revenge was your only focus.

Now I don't...

911
00:57:30,889 --> 00:57:32,090
trust you anymore.

912
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:50,269
Why did you bring me here?

913
00:57:54,909 --> 00:57:58,849
Chief Prosecutor Jang is going to
expose your campaign funds.

914
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,519
What'll you do now?

915
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:03,079
You're completely cornered.

916
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:07,159
Chief Prosecutor Jang, that jerk.

917
00:58:07,159 --> 00:58:11,659
I bet he's getting back at you
for losing his place to you.

918
00:58:11,659 --> 00:58:12,829
Why don't you...

919
00:58:14,059 --> 00:58:16,500
go tell your daughter,
Prosecutor Kang Yeon Hee?

920
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,800
I know. I did it already.

921
00:58:18,929 --> 00:58:22,340
I gave her a heads up.

922
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:26,539
But a guy named Cheon Seung Beom
took the case.

923
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:30,750
Cheon Seung Beom?

924
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:35,849

926
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:42,190
I know. There might be
a way out though.

927

Don't be too discouraged.

928
00:58:44,389 --> 00:58:45,889
Look, Madam Nam.

929
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:49,130
If you want your money back,

930
00:58:49,429 --> 00:58:52,469
you'd better play along with me.

931
00:58:52,469 --> 00:58:56,769
Of course. There's nothing
more important than money.

981
01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:46,730
But this is a 40-year-old building.

982
01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:48,300
It could collapse any day.

983
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:51,570
She's using me to get rid
of her people...

984
01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:52,909
who know her secret.

985
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:56,840
Detective Wu who's charged with
the murder of Mayor Lee Young Soo...

986
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,550
will stand his first trial.

987
01:02:58,550 --> 01:03:00,650
She made me come to Kiseong.

988
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:02,780
I'm setting up a lawyer's office
in Kiseong.

989
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:03,989
Detective Wu Hyung Man,

990
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:07,019
let me make you a free man.

991
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:09,190
And she tried to use me
as her sword.

992
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:10,690
Who are you?

993
01:03:11,530 --> 01:03:14,730
I'm Attorney Bong Sang Pil.

994
01:03:19,429 --> 01:03:21,969
Chief Prosecutor Jang,
how did it go?

995
01:03:22,369 --> 01:03:23,469
An Oh Ju...

996
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:28,010
is completely doomed.

997
01:03:35,719 --> 01:03:37,079
An Oh Ju.

998
01:03:38,889 --> 01:03:42,090
She needed my vengeance
to get rid of him.

999
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:45,289
Cha Moon Sook knows
about people's desire...

1000
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:49,000
and how to take advantage
of it better than anyone.

1001
01:03:49,329 --> 01:03:50,329
But...

1002
01:03:50,699 --> 01:03:53,000
Cha Moon Sook is at the end
of your vengeance.

1003
01:03:55,070 --> 01:03:58,769
Knowing that the point of
my sword is aiming at her,

1004
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:01,539
she chose me.

1005
01:04:03,739 --> 01:04:04,949
Cha Moon Sook.

1006
01:04:32,570 --> 01:04:34,309
(Lawless Lawyer)

1007
01:04:34,409 --> 01:04:35,739
It's one of the two.

1008
01:04:35,739 --> 01:04:37,809
You destroyed the evidence...

1009
01:04:37,809 --> 01:04:40,480
or found someone to bear your cross.

1010
01:04:40,849 --> 01:04:42,349
Will you help me?

1011
01:04:42,349 --> 01:04:43,519
Did you take my mom?

1012
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:45,150
I told you to stop.

1013
01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:46,150
Calm down.

1014
01:04:46,150 --> 01:04:49,619
I'll use Cha Moon Sook's weakness
that no one knows about.

1015
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:51,989
Take care of
my borrowed-name bank account.

1016
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:55,099
Get rid of it. Throw it into the sea
so it can never be found.

1017
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:56,900
Are you serious?

1018
01:04:57,369 --> 01:04:59,099
That's justice.

1019
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,869
Please believe me
and wait a little more.
