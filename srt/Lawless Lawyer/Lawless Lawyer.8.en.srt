00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:47,090
Excuse me.

8
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,950
Gosh...

9
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,329
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:57,259 --> 00:00:58,560
Are you all right?

11
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:06,299
Yes.

12
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,480
Wait, you dropped this.

13
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,849
Jae I.

14
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,120
What's wrong?
Is it someone you know?

15
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:19,879
What? No.

16
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:21,920
What's this?

17
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:24,920
I don't know. She left this.

18
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,299
Jae I.

19
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:42,370
It's me, your mom.

20
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,590
Attorney Ha Jae I's mother...

21
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,930
is alive.

(Attorney Ha Jae I's mother
is alive, Wu Hyung Man)

23
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:10,800
I'm here, Boss.

(Episode 8)

25
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:15,310
I need you to find someone.

26
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,310
As soon as possible.

27
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,389
I got a call
from the bar association today.

28
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,919
My suspension has been lifted.

29
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:33,219
Congratulations on being able
to work as an attorney again, Jae I.

30
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:48,310
I didn't tell Dad that Judge Cha
got it lifted for me,

31
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:50,639
so I feel bad.

32
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,979
I'm a daddy's girl, so I used to
keep no secrets from him.

33
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,189
But I keep having to hide
things from him these days.

34
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,599
Why aren't you drinking? I'm
the only one who's been drinking.

35
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,199
You're so drunk now.
I should stay sober.

36
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,310
I'm not drunk at all.

37
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,110
Drink up.

38
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,819
You shouldn't drink anymore.

39
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,689
More!

40
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:46,360
You're very cute when you're drunk,

41
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:48,500
Jae I.

42
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:56,340
Bong Sang Pil.

43
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:00,909
Hang in there.
I'll take you home soon.

44
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,080
I didn't know
that your back was so broad.

45
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,259
My gosh, thank you.

46
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:13,020
Thank you very much.

47
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,990
Is it your first time
visiting Judge Cha's place?

48
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,029
Yes, I did visit her family home...

49
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,500
when her father was alive,
but it is my first time here.

50
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,339
She rarely invites an outsider...

51
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:27,410
- to her place.
- I see.

52
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:30,379
It means that she thinks
very highly of you.

53
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:41,089
Welcome, Mr. Ha.

54
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:44,389
My gosh, Judge Cha.
I'm much obliged.

55
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,759
Please have a seat.

56
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,889
Thank you.

57
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:03,339
Thank you.

58
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:10,279
Judge Cha's autobiography
will come out soon.

59
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:14,019
Oh, really?

60
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,490
Right, who will write
an autobiography if you don't?

61
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:21,230
I need a photo
for my autobiography.

62
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:22,660
I'd like to ask you to take it.

63
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,360
My gosh, you don't even have to ask.

64
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,069
I should take it for you, of course.

65
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,839
I'm always grateful to you...

66
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,569
for taking my father's photo.

67
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:36,339
It was a great honor for me.

68
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:39,639
Jae I can go back to working
as an attorney now,

69
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,449
so you must be relieved.

70
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,819
Yes. Of course, ma'am.

71
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:46,779
That only happened because
Judge Cha filed a complaint...

72
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:50,490
to the disciplinary committee
and the administrative court...

73
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,389
to get her suspension lifted.

74
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:53,560
Oh, I see.

75
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:56,589
My goodness, I didn't know.

76
00:05:57,329 --> 00:05:58,930
Thank you very much.

77
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,839
Judge Cha, I don't even know
how to thank you for everything.

78
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,610
- Please have a seat.
- Okay.

79
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:14,610
I'm not sure
why Jae I didn't tell you.

80
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,379
She's too good
to just stay here in Kiseong.

81
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,189
You should send her back to Seoul.

82
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,490
I'll find a good law firm for her.

83
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,420
Okay, Judge Cha.

84
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,230
Thank you.

85
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,060
- Thank you very much.
- But I don't know...

86
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,959
if she'll be
willing to leave Kiseong.

87
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,600
It looks like she and Attorney Bong
have gotten very close.

88
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,439
No. I'll send her
to Seoul right away.

89
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:43,339
Yes.

90
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,949
- Goodbye.
- Take care.

91
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,220
Did you get her suspension lifted...

92
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,930
to manipulate him, not Ha Jae I?

93
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,699
She never goes against
her father, you know.

94
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:11,600
I thought you did it
because you were fond of her.

95
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,370
My gosh, I still have
a long way to go...

96
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,209
to be as astute as you are.
Goodness me.

97
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,180
What's this smell?

98
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:25,620
Something stinks.
Disinfect everything right away.

99
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,350
And wash the carpet
Mr. Ha stepped on immediately.

100
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,389
Okay, ma'am.

101
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,430
Gosh, I'm just going to sleep
at a hotel tonight. Bring my stuff.

102
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:36,689
Got it, Judge Cha.

103
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,740
What? Gosh, Sang Pil. Get me down.

104
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,209
Why? Just stay like that.

105
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:50,540
Get me down.
This is my dad's photo studio.

106
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,310
- It's okay.
- Get me down now.

107
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,850
- Oh, no. My shoes.
- Look at that.

108
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,079
Even your feet are pretty, Jae I.

109
00:07:57,579 --> 00:07:59,480
Be careful. There.

110
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:03,189
Gosh, my shoes.

111
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:04,620
Jae I.

112
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:08,860
Dad.

113
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:12,759
I drank a little.

114
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:17,240
Hello, Mr. Ha.

115
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,540
Let's go inside.

116
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,070
Dad.

117
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,269
Where have you been...

118
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:56,639
at this late hour?

119
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:00,750
I heard Judge Cha
got your suspension lifted for you.

120
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,580
Why didn't you tell me?

121
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,889
Did you just meet with her?

122
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,559
Yes.

123
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,259
She said that she'll find
a big law firm in Seoul for you.

124
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:21,269
You should never forget
how much she's done for you.

125
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,330
Judge Cha...

126
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,200
isn't the kind of person
you think she is.

127
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:26,769
What did you just say?

128
00:09:27,809 --> 00:09:30,639
How dare you speak so rudely?

129
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,309
Go get some rest.

130
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:37,820
Mom's disappearance...

131
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:43,049
Judge Cha was behind it.

132
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,789
What? What did you say?

133
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,059
Dad.

134
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,429
It was all Cha Moon Sook's doing.

135
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,500
How dare you!

136
00:09:56,169 --> 00:09:58,100
You're being like this
because of Bong Sang Pil, right?

137
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,970
I know everything!

138
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,539
Dad.

139
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,980
Pack up your stuff
and go to Seoul this instant.

140
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:24,100
What brings you here at this hour?

141
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,409
What's this?

142
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:40,580
Can I stay here
for the next little while?

143
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:41,779
Here?

144
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,350
- Is something...
- Don't ask.

145
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:50,759
You fought with your dad.

146
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,190
Because of me?

147
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:57,600
No. It was because of me.

148
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,200
If I stay with Dad,

149
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:03,269
I thought I'd tell him all
about Judge Cha, so I left.

150
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,110
Well done.

151
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,850
What do you want?

152
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,490
An Americano or a latte?

153
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,090
An Americano.

154
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:31,000
Okay. Barista Bong's
Americano is coming up.

155
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:32,929
Wait just a bit.

156
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,850
Here's your coffee.

157
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,190
It tastes good.

158
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,830
What was your mother like?

159
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,870
My mom?

160
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,570
A nurse. She was
a nurse-like attorney.

161
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,509
When I was hospitalized as a kid,

162
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,379
the nurse came to check my wounds
even when I didn't ask her to,

163
00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:22,450
and she checked
my temperature all night.

164
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,950
And asked if I was in pain.

165
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:29,720
That's how my mom was like
to her clients.

166
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,990
I'd like to be
an attorney like that.

167
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:41,629
That's why my mom
asked your mom for help.

168
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:45,870
I guess?

169
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,009
Do you dream of becoming
an attorney like her too?

170
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,980
First,

171
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,250
I want to see Judge Cha be judged.

172
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,549
Only then...

173
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:03,590
I can figure out
what kind of an attorney I'll be.

174
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,720
Okay.

175
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,370
My mom's birthday...

176
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,600
is coming up.

177
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:28,549
I didn't do anything for her.

178
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:30,779
You were too young...

179
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,480
back then.

180
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,850
So was I.

181
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,879
Shall I show you something?

182
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,419
- What?
- Watch.

183
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,850
This is a massage chair.

184
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,190
It's so relaxing.

185
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,500
We confirmed
the Thai woman's arrival.

186
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,070
Two days ago
through Incheon Airport.

187
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,370
- I see.
- I think she's in Kiseong.

188
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:30,509
In Kiseong?

189
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,840
Yes.

190
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:35,149
Man Bae.

191
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,210
Yes, boss.

192
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,750
I must be away for a few days.

193
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:42,750
Watch things while I'm gone.

194
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,590
I'll send some men with you.

195
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,590
No.

196
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,830
I must go alone this time.

197
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,309
(Welcome, Mayor An)

198
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,649
- Welcome.
- You're all hard at work.

199
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:15,019
- Hello.
- Hello.

200
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:17,419
Could you smile for us?

201
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:18,659
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

202
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:19,720
Thank you.

203
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,529
The room is yours.

204
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,940
When will you get me out?

205
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,870
I did what I did because
you had my back.

206
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,179
Oh, dear.

207
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,980
You want me to get you out?

208
00:15:43,049 --> 00:15:48,019
You have to take the fall
for this one.

209
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:50,549
Isn't that obvious?

210
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:51,559
What?

211
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,690
You thug.

212
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:56,690
You're speaking your mind now?
I'm what, a thug?

213
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,059
- A thug?
- Hey.

214
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,929
I won't go down alone.

215
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:04,570
Are you saying you'll take...

216
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:08,070
your whole family down with you?

217
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,840
No husband and father
should do that.

218
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:12,009
This.

219
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,480
Isn't this your daughter?

220
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,120
You raised her well. She's pretty.

221
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,019
Here.

222
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:23,620
I'll let you talk to her.

223
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:29,730
Who's this?

224
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,100
I was concerned for your daughter.

225
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:37,799
I have some burly men
watching out for her.

226
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,269
How dare you...

227
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,009
You...

228
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,710
- You...
- Whether those burly men...

229
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:53,049
will protect her...

230
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,519
or make her a victim of
a random attack.

231
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:00,620
That's all up to you, isn't it?

232
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,029
This lawyer I know...

233
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:10,730
worked for 18 years...

234
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:16,710
to gain revenge for his mother.

235
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:22,549
What is there a husband
and father...

236
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,779
won't do for his family?

237
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:31,289
I did it all.

238
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:33,359
You'll take the fall?

239
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,130
I committed a crime.

240
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,000
I will pay the price.

241
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:47,809
Do you think I won't
be able to get to An Oh Ju?

242
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:49,970
Go for it if you can.

243
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,109
I bet there's nothing you can do.

244
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,880
The chief prosecutor asked for you.

245
00:18:02,089 --> 00:18:04,250
He seems to want to close the case.

246
00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:13,630
Sir!

247
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:16,869
What are you doing?

248
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:20,869
An Oh Ju visited the prison
and talked to President Son.

249
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:21,910
Prosecutor Cheon.

250
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,680
Don't get too worked up.

251
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:29,680
You can't prove anything
with what you have right now.

252
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,980
I have to sit and watch
while they sacrifice him?

253
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:35,720
That's enough.

254
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,890
That jerk.

255
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:47,130
A toast to Attorney Ha Jae I!

256
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,029
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

257
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:52,000
- Bottom's up.
- Bottom's up.

258
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,210
You went from a paralegal
to an attorney.

259
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,910
I'll work hard for Lawless Law Firm.

260
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:07,920
Attorney Ha, for you.

261
00:19:11,589 --> 00:19:13,589
You all should eat up.

262
00:19:15,859 --> 00:19:18,460
A loan shark office
in the outskirts of Kiseong...

263
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,700
became a law firm
with two attorneys.

264
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,700
I have a feeling
it was all down to me.

265
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,140
Geum Kang, you're doing well.

266
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,470
It's nothing.

267
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,240
- We have a problem.
- What is it?

268
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,279
We don't have a paralegal.

269
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,650
Mr. Tae will always be a director.

270
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:40,250
Do you think I could help?

271
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:44,420
- You can't even add numbers.
- What?

272
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,890
Geum Ja's a human calculator.

273
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:50,029
As of today, Geum Ja
is our new paralegal.

274
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:51,059
Applause.

275
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,730
Really?

276
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:57,970
That means I'll have to be with you
at all times, Attorney Bong.

277
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,240
Work hard.

278
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:02,910
Work hard.

279
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,680
- Thanks.
- Attorney Ha.

280
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,650
Did you work late and
spend the night at the office?

281
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,079
Well...

282
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,250
Attention, please.

283
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,720
Attorney Ha's family
has some issues,

284
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,819
so she'll be staying at
our office for a while, okay?

285
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,930
A woman, away from home?

286
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:26,000
For longer than a few days? No way.

287
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,930
I don't mind, Geum Ja.

288
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,569
But I do.

289
00:20:31,569 --> 00:20:32,839
Stay with me.

290
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,640
Can I do that?

291
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,140
Come over today.

292
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,009
That's good.

293
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,180
- Geum Ja.
- What?

294
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:45,779
Stop trying to break those two up.

295
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,220
You're only wasting your time.

296
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,720
Just you wait and see.

297
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,490
I'll make sure you climb
up the social ladder...

298
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:55,230
- Oh, gosh.
- as Attorney Bong's brother-in-law.

299
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,470
- Go, Hook of Kiseong.
- Go, go.

300
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,730
Eat up.

301
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,900
Good girl.
I love that ambition of yours.

302
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:10,440
(Prosecutor Cheon Seung Beom)

303
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,839
Hello?

304
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,250
Sang Pil, we need to talk.

305
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,480
Come to my office.

306
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:19,880
You should come to see me.

307
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,490
I have something to tell you.

308
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,690
This little brat...

309
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,430
He's hanging up on me
now that he's an attorney.

310
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,630
- Who is he?
- He wants me to come...

311
00:21:34,099 --> 00:21:35,200
to his office instead.

312
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,700
I bet you don't get that in Seoul.

313
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:40,869
It's the Kiseong way though.
People are a bit rougher.

314
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,210
You're right.

315
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:44,839
Kiseong is Sang Pil's hometown.

316
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:47,539
Attorney Bong Sang Pil?

317
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,509
By any chance,

318
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,450
is he the man who
recommended me to you?

319
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,049
Well...

320
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:57,589
I should get going.

321
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:02,960
Lawless Law Firm.

322
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,200
Are you now picking a fight
with the law too?

323
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:08,569
You really are
an outlaw, aren't you?

324
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:11,269
Outlaws are those
who are above the law.

325
00:22:11,269 --> 00:22:13,640
My goal is to take on those
with the law...

326
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,440
just like you.

327
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,539
Gosh.

328
00:22:17,009 --> 00:22:18,380
That's a nice way to put it.

329
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:22,349
How are you doing
with the bank of president's case?

330
00:22:22,349 --> 00:22:23,509
I didn't hear of an arrest.

331
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:27,220
An Oh Ju cleanly cut off the tail.

332
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:31,390
Are you saying that we can't
bring An Oh Ju to justice?

333
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,920
That's how it is right now...

334
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,619
with this particular case.

335
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:37,859
I laid out a seafood buffet for you,

336
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,960
but all you did was nibble
on small fishes.

337
00:22:41,829 --> 00:22:44,799
That's really nothing to brag about.

338
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,069
Attorney Bong, watch your language.

339
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:49,269
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's all right.

340
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:53,609
Okay, I guess we have to
forget about Son Sung Sik then.

341
00:22:55,809 --> 00:22:57,680
I'll bring you another case.

342
00:22:59,849 --> 00:23:02,390
- Thank you for coming.
- I'll call you.

343
00:23:07,789 --> 00:23:08,859
I'm sorry.

344
00:23:10,059 --> 00:23:11,660
Are you Ms. Noh Hyun Joo?

345
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,029
You...

346
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,269
Who are you?

347
00:23:21,339 --> 00:23:22,710
Who are you...

348
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:24,509
and how do you know me?

349
00:23:24,509 --> 00:23:26,109
I'm Jin Ae's older brother.

350
00:23:28,109 --> 00:23:29,109
Choi Jin Ae.

351
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,150
It's been 18 years,

352
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,519
but I'm sure you haven't forgotten.

353
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,890
Attorney Choi Jin Ae?

354
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:41,460
Detective Wu told me
before he died...

355
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,160
that you're alive.

356
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,170
Do you know what'll happen...

357
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,829
if the other side know you're alive?

358
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:54,500
- I know.
- But still you came back here.

359
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,980
For 18 years, I lived alone...

360
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,410
without letting anyone in my life.

361
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,049
I...

362
00:24:09,589 --> 00:24:11,819
don't want to live
like that anymore.

363
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,519
So what's your plan?

364
00:24:16,829 --> 00:24:19,599
What can you do about it anyway?

365
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,869
Judge Cha,
your shoulders must be stiff...

366
00:24:25,869 --> 00:24:29,839
from the stress generated
from Son Sung Sik's case.

367
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:32,809
Do you feel better now?

368
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,980
Judge Cha,
I've been meaning to ask.

369
00:24:39,549 --> 00:24:42,349
What's going to happen
to Ohju Group?

370
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,089
People have been gossiping about it.

371
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:49,089
All of An Oh Ju's shares will be...

372
00:24:49,089 --> 00:24:51,359
donated to my father's foundation.

373
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,000
Chairman An...

374
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:58,500
sure is magnanimous.

375
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,500
That's right,
so give him a little credit.

376
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:05,210
You never know what...

377
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:07,440
he truly thinks of it though.

378
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,549
Mayor An is the kind of person...

379
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:13,049
that lives and breathes for money.

380
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:16,319
Judge Cha, may I come in?

381
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,089
My goodness, Judge Cha.

382
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:24,190
Just so you know, I took care of
the bank of president's case.

383
00:25:25,099 --> 00:25:28,769
He agreed to take the fall
and keep our secret...

384
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:30,230
to his grave.

385
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,940
Good job, Mayor An.

386
00:25:34,369 --> 00:25:35,509
I heard you're donating...

387
00:25:35,509 --> 00:25:37,869
all your assets to
Judge Cha Byung Ho's foundation.

388
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:41,279
The country must reward you
for your huge donation.

389
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,480
You very well know
that my wounds are cut wide open,

390
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,819
but yet you spray salt on them.

391
00:25:46,819 --> 00:25:48,690
You were practically robbed,

392
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,549
so of course, you're a bit salty.

393
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:57,059
Ms. Nam, are you expressing
your concerns for me?

394
00:25:58,029 --> 00:25:59,559
I'm greatly touched.

395
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:03,299
I'm only scared that
I'll lose what I have,

396
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:04,730
so don't flatter yourself.

397
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:07,769
That reminds me.

398
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:11,539
I heard that Judge Cha had...

399
00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:13,910
Ha Jae I's suspension lifted.

400
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:18,079
From what I hear,
she's more talented...

401
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:20,980
than Prosecutor Kang. Is that true?

402
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,619
- Mayor An!
- Yes?

403
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,720
How did you know that?

404
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,730
Judge Cha gave me
the orders in secret.

405
00:26:34,329 --> 00:26:39,940
Oh, well, I'm just
a very intuitive man.

406
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:41,910
It was a hunch.

407
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,779
Take care, then.

408
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,049
Leave us.

409
00:26:57,589 --> 00:26:59,160
You may be blind,

410
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:04,660
but you're a witch
who sees into people's minds.

411
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,259
Sorry?

412
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,369
You've been playing...

413
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:11,869
me and Judge Cha.

414
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,170
Did you volunteer...

415
00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:18,440
or did Mayor An order you?

416
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,950
Just tell me that.

417
00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:24,549
I don't understand what you mean.

418
00:27:26,849 --> 00:27:30,289
My goodness.
You have such fair hands.

419
00:27:36,589 --> 00:27:38,289
Can you tell what this is?

420
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:40,960
Please. Don't hurt me, ma'am.

421
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,069
Then talk!

422
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:45,069
If you don't,
I'll shove this in your mouth.

423
00:27:45,069 --> 00:27:48,569
Ma'am, please! I'm sorry.

424
00:27:48,569 --> 00:27:49,910
Did Mayor An order you?

425
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,880
Yes, he did.

426
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,710
I only followed his orders.

427
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:04,420
I don't wish for anything.

428
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:07,859
All I want is
to live happily with...

429
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,690
my husband and daughter.

430
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,599
That's all I want.

431
00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:23,710
I'll help you then.

432
00:28:26,309 --> 00:28:28,279
My nephew's caught up
in this business anyway.

433
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,150
Also, Sang Pil and Jae I...

434
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,980
have gotten quite close.

435
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:38,819
I won't just sit by
and let this slide anymore.

436
00:28:40,789 --> 00:28:41,859
I'll...

437
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,559
do anything you ask.

438
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:48,400
I can do anything
to live with my daughter.

439
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:51,670
I'll try and look for a way,

440
00:28:52,869 --> 00:28:54,440
so let's work on it together.

441
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:57,309
Thank you.

442
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:02,009
According to
the prosecution service,

443
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:04,750
Bank President Son Sung Sik
confessed to all charges.

444
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,720
Meanwhile,

445
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,720
Mayor An Oh Ju
demonstrated his generosity.

446
00:29:10,089 --> 00:29:12,190
During his surprise visit to
the scholarship award ceremony...

447
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:14,160
of Judge Cha Byung Ho's foundation,

448
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,230
he donated all of
his Ohju Group shares...

449
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:18,500
keeping the promise he made
about giving back to society.

450
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:27,039
Judge Cha...

451
00:29:27,569 --> 00:29:29,609
finally gained control
of Ohju Group.

452
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:33,640
An Oh Ju planned to
only move his money...

453
00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:35,750
from one pocket to another.

454
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:37,809
However,

455
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:41,049
it ended up landing
in someone else's.

456
00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:42,250
(The Seven)

457
00:29:42,349 --> 00:29:44,549
I knew she was greedy for power,

458
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:48,529
but her appetite for money
is also grand.

459
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:53,299
We might get buried ourselves
if we go after them individually.

460
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:54,660
You're right.

461
00:29:55,099 --> 00:29:57,769
We need a big net
to catch them all at once.

462
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:12,150
Sang Pil, I'm sorry that
you weren't successful.

463
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:16,450
Son Sung Sik took all the blame,

464
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:19,690
so you lost one person
to get revenge on.

465
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:23,990
Why not think that
I'm one step closer to getting you?

466
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,660
I guess you're right.

467
00:30:28,099 --> 00:30:30,230
Since you cut off my hand though,

468
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:33,769
I should cut something of yours too.

469
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:37,910
Obviously,

470
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,009
I should probably target...

471
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,549
someone who's very dear to you.

472
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,519
Try to stop me if you can.

473
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:57,730
Who was that?

474
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,160
What?

475
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,099
It was just a spam call.

476
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,170
Then what's with that face?

477
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,609
You're going to stay at Ms. Geum's
place starting today, right?

478
00:31:11,009 --> 00:31:12,039
Yes.

479
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,640
Then you should leave early today.

480
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,009
What about you?

481
00:31:15,509 --> 00:31:16,750
I have things to finish off.

482
00:31:18,579 --> 00:31:19,720
I'll see you tomorrow.

483
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:28,119
Yes, Uncle Dae Woong.
Where are you now?

484
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,960
I'm on my way to Seoul
to ask you a favor.

485
00:31:31,529 --> 00:31:32,859
I'm in Kiseong now.

486
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:35,900
- You're in Kiseong?
- Shall we grab a drink together?

487
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:37,799
Sure, okay.

488
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,380
I came because I missed you.

489
00:31:48,849 --> 00:31:52,279
You're my nephew after all,
so I think of you from time to time.

490
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,890
I'm sorry I don't call you
often enough, Uncle Dae Woong.

491
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,519
What can I do?
I should just visit when I miss you.

492
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,529
An Oh Ju has...

493
00:32:07,529 --> 00:32:09,200
declared war against me.

494
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,529
Did he?

495
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,009
You threw a punch at him,
so he wouldn't just sit still.

496
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:21,180
I need you to protect Jae I.

497
00:32:22,349 --> 00:32:23,849
Is that why you wanted to see me?

498
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:27,250
I can't be by her side all the time,
you know.

499
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,119
Please protect her.

500
00:32:31,589 --> 00:32:32,720
What about Kwang Soo?

501
00:32:33,089 --> 00:32:34,289
If I get him to do it,

502
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:37,160
Jae I will find out everything.

503
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,529
If that happens,

504
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:41,630
it'll get more dangerous.

505
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:43,829
Right.

506
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:48,670
There are things that you don't want
your loved ones to find out.

507
00:32:50,809 --> 00:32:52,710
I see that there's someone
you want to protect now.

508
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,779
You must truly care about her.

509
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,720
Sang Pil.

510
00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:05,990
Can't you just...

511
00:33:07,059 --> 00:33:09,490
try to live a happy, normal life...

512
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:11,990
with that lady from now on?

513
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,029
I'll deal with An Oh Ju
and Cha Moon Sook.

514
00:33:17,099 --> 00:33:18,230
No, I can't do that.

515
00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:21,740
Please I need you...

516
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,039
to protect Jae I.

517
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:27,079
All right.

518
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:31,450
I won't let that young lady
end up in danger,

519
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,920
so don't worry.

520
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:46,299
Mr. Mayor, everything is going
according to your plan.

521
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:48,130
Yes.

522
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,740
Your place is so nicely decorated.

523
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,410
Are you going to say
it doesn't suit me?

524
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:01,309
No, not at all.
It totally suits you.

525
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:05,180
The bathroom is over there,
and the water dispenser is here.

526
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,920
What you're wearing now
goes with the decor.

527
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,289
- Thanks.
- Okay.

528
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:11,590
You can sleep here.

529
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,190
- Have a good night.
- Wait.

530
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:17,360
Thank you for doing this for me.

531
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:21,599
Just make yourself at home.

532
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,099
I live alone, so it's all good.

533
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:28,940
Let's be like sisters from now on.

534
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:32,710
We haven't known each other for
long. Since when were we that close?

535
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,110
Since today.

536
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:36,849
My goodness.

537
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:39,480
What's wrong with you?
You're so chatty today.

538
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,619
You should go to bed now, Sister.

539
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:43,920
Thanks, Geum Ja.

540
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,090
Gosh, you're making me cringe.

541
00:34:56,869 --> 00:34:58,570
Did you arrive in Seoul safely?

542
00:34:59,539 --> 00:35:01,000
How can you leave
without telling me?

543
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:05,579
I'm sorry I slapped you like that.
Take good care of your health.

544
00:35:13,349 --> 00:35:17,119
A few are putting up a fight,
but that's all we need to sort out.

545
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,260
- Mr. Union President.
- Yes, sir.

546
00:35:24,829 --> 00:35:26,599
If they keep it up,

547
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,170
just bulldoze the entire area.

548
00:35:29,699 --> 00:35:34,199
If we're considerate
of everyone's situation,

549
00:35:35,269 --> 00:35:37,210
we won't be able
to achieve our goal.

550
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:41,039
It'll totally bog us down.

551
00:35:45,179 --> 00:35:46,449
I'm here, sir.

552
00:35:46,849 --> 00:35:48,280
What did I tell you?

553
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:51,989
Didn't I say that Choi Dae Woong
would come to Kiseong?

554
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,989
- Yes, sir. You did.
- Bong Sang Pil...

555
00:35:56,289 --> 00:35:59,300
has no one else that he can trust.

556
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,460
He had no choice...

557
00:36:01,699 --> 00:36:05,199
but to turn to Choi Dae Woong
to keep his woman safe.

558
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,639
Yes. You're absolutely right, sir.

559
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:09,739
You see,

560
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:13,579
I'm holding two trump cards...

561
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:15,110
in my hand at the moment.

562
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,780
Now, I just need to decide...

563
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,619
which one to use
and what to get from it.

564
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,599
Long time no see.

565
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:09,500
Is the accountant you stole from me
still working out well for you?

566
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,800
Goodness.

567
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,340
You've gotten quite gutsy,
Gwan Dong.

568
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,400
How dare you stop my car?

569
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,539
I don't get to see you often
in Kiseong.

570
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,239
Let me take you somewhere.

571
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,179
I'm not here to see you.

572
00:37:23,179 --> 00:37:26,380
Mayor An Oh Ju
would like to meet with you.

573
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,750
I guess he wants to throw
a welcome party for you.

574
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:33,860
An Oh Ju?

575
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:41,730
Shall I bring them in, ma'am?

576
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:44,269
You handpicked them yourself, right?

577
00:37:44,269 --> 00:37:45,739
Of course, ma'am.

578
00:37:45,969 --> 00:37:47,340
Just a moment, please.

579
00:38:02,889 --> 00:38:04,289
Let me introduce them to you, ma'am.

580
00:38:04,989 --> 00:38:06,559
She's a masseuse
with 20 years of experience.

581
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:08,760
The one in the middle
has a year-long waiting list.

582
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:11,929
This lady here returned to Korea
recently after living in Thailand...

583
00:38:11,929 --> 00:38:13,260
- for a long time...
- Shut it!

584
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:15,460
I never asked you to explain.

585
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,699
I have a keen eye.

586
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,070
I'm sorry, ma'am.

587
00:38:19,469 --> 00:38:20,539
It's fine.

588
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:25,639
Are you all aware of
what this job entails?

589
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:28,780
Top expert in Kiseong
deserves the job, of course.

590
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,250
What about you?

591
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:32,349
I'm a certified
acupressure practitioner,

592
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:34,250
and I've mastered
meridian massage therapy as well.

593
00:38:34,449 --> 00:38:36,349
I'll know exactly what to do, ma'am.

594
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:37,619
Is that so?

595
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,889
I heard that I'll have to keep
my eyes and mouth shut,

596
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:44,630
no matter whom I meet.

597
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:50,369
Can I have a word with you?

598
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,650
So you lived in Thailand
for a long time?

599
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,190
Yes, ma'am.

600
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:10,590
Then I guess...

601
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,289
you probably don't know
anyone in Kiseong.

602
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:16,059
That's right, ma'am.

603
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,389
I'll pay you three times more.

604
00:39:20,429 --> 00:39:21,800
About what you said earlier...

605
00:39:22,869 --> 00:39:24,170
Always keep it in mind.

606
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,179
- Bo Mi.
- Yes?

607
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:40,119
I think we're out of toner.

608
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:41,980
I'll make you another case.

609
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,389
Now you want to boss
a prosecutor around?

610
00:39:44,389 --> 00:39:47,420
If you join me
and go after An Oh Ju,

611
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,630
if things work out,

612
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:52,460
you might reach
the highest prosecutor position.

613
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,960
Look at you.
You're threatening me too?

614
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:57,130
It's all fine,

615
00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:00,940
but because I put you
behind bars, I don't trust you.

616
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:04,139
Sang Pil's an attorney now.

617
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:05,639
Get rid of your prejudice.

618
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,349
Is the chief prosecutor
in with An Oh Ju?

619
00:40:11,349 --> 00:40:15,280
Is that all you see right now?

620
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:16,519
Who else?

621
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:19,360
Prosecutor Kang Yeon Hee,
Attorney Go In Du,

622
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:22,360
Editor-in-chief Han Tae Kyeong
and Nam Soon Ja.

623
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:27,400
This buffet of yours has
so many tasty delicacies.

624
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,400
And then...

625
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:31,530
at the top, there's
Judge Cha Moon Sook.

626
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:41,280
What an interesting neighborhood...

627
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,250
Kiseong is.

628
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:48,079
Come in.

629
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,960
Prosecutor Kang? What do you want?

630
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,300
I was assigned to work with you.

631
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,769
- Here?
- Yes.

632
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:09,000
To teach you about Kiseong...

633
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,469
and help you.

634
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:13,539
You're no guide. You're a spy.

635
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:15,079
Pardon?

636
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:16,280
Never mind.

637
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,449
I hope we get along.

638
00:41:28,389 --> 00:41:31,530
- Who's this?
- Your new masseuse.

639
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:34,000
Go on, say hello.

640
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,000
Hello.

641
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:38,699
She looks familiar.

642
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:41,300
Look up.

643
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,179
Look up at her.

644
00:41:56,849 --> 00:41:58,519
You look very cautious.

645
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,159
What's your name?

646
00:42:01,789 --> 00:42:04,429
Apinya Perompupa Charsumama.

647
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:08,829
What? Papi... Pepper... What?

648
00:42:09,329 --> 00:42:12,130
The sun will set
while we say your name.

649
00:42:12,969 --> 00:42:15,909
We'll just call you Mama.

650
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:17,039
Okay.

651
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:19,139
You can call me Mama.

652
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:22,309
- Begin.
- Okay. I'll start with the feet.

653
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:31,619
Did Mr. Ha tell Jae I or what?

654
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,730
She challenged me outright.

655
00:42:40,059 --> 00:42:41,730
That doesn't sit right with me.

656
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:53,079
(Mom's birthday)

657
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:00,820
What's this?

658
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:03,719
Change into this and come with me.

659
00:43:03,889 --> 00:43:04,949
Attorney Ha.

660
00:43:06,889 --> 00:43:07,920
Clothes?

661
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:10,329
For a meeting?

662
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:13,230
You should get ready.

663
00:43:13,829 --> 00:43:16,130
If it's a meeting,
I'm going with you, right?

664
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:17,130
Oh, right.

665
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:20,070
I left some papers on your desk.

666
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:22,300
Submit them to court for me, please.

667
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:30,480
Clothes? Wait.

668
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,579
Colleagues shouldn't act like this.

669
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:34,079
Goodbye.

670
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,619
It's not my luck to have
an attorney brother-in-law.

671
00:43:36,619 --> 00:43:37,920
Oh, gosh. It's hot!

672
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,559
What should I get?

673
00:43:50,699 --> 00:43:53,099
It suits you nicely.

674
00:43:54,769 --> 00:43:57,010
I look good in pretty much anything.

675
00:43:59,909 --> 00:44:01,610
Why do we need flowers?

676
00:44:01,909 --> 00:44:03,349
You said we are going for a meeting?

677
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,480
Oh, right.

678
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:05,849
I should choose.

679
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,949
It's only right for the giver...

680
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:11,820
to pick out the flowers.

681
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:16,690
It's pretty.

682
00:44:20,059 --> 00:44:21,360
These will do.

683
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,039
Do you have a harmonica at home?

684
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,710
What? A harmonica?

685
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:35,110
Yes.

686
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,219
Bong Sang Pil. Where are we going?

687
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:44,420
Are you tired? Sorry.

688
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:46,320
We're almost there.

689
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:49,929
Hurry up.

690
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,260
I'm exhausted.

691
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:56,099
Special events aren't for him.

692
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,840
I can't figure him out.

693
00:45:04,539 --> 00:45:05,539
Why?

694
00:45:06,179 --> 00:45:07,239
Shall I carry you again?

695
00:45:10,909 --> 00:45:12,079
- Hey.
- I'm exhausted.

696
00:45:12,579 --> 00:45:14,150
Don't be so grouchy.

697
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:20,059
Be good, Jae I. Here.

698
00:45:28,429 --> 00:45:29,429
Are you...

699
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:32,130
going to confess?

700
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:36,710
Let's go.

701
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:44,210
It's nice.

702
00:45:45,349 --> 00:45:47,420
You're slacking off
in the name of a meeting.

703
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,420
You should've said so.

704
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:53,559
Then I'd have worn sneakers.

705
00:45:54,659 --> 00:45:55,760
Really?

706
00:46:04,829 --> 00:46:06,000
Why is there a cake?

707
00:46:10,739 --> 00:46:13,639
- Is this...
- It's your mother's birthday.

708
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:18,909
You wanted to celebrate it.

709
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,679
I don't know her age.

710
00:46:52,579 --> 00:46:53,750
I bought a set.

711
00:47:03,289 --> 00:47:04,289
There.

712
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,400
Isn't my mom young?

713
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,300
She really is young.

714
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,440
I really didn't...

715
00:47:16,269 --> 00:47:18,210
imagine you'd do this.

716
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:22,780
Mom.

717
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:25,809
Attorney Bong set things up today.

718
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:29,219
But I'll celebrate for you
from now on.

719
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:33,559
Sorry.

720
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:42,659
Madam. Happy birthday.

721
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:50,110
Happy birthday to you

722
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:54,340
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

723
00:47:55,139 --> 00:47:59,050
- Happy birthday dear Mom
- Happy birthday dear madam

724
00:47:59,849 --> 00:48:03,320
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

725
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:07,820
Happy birthday.

726
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:09,889
Don't cry.

727
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:11,730
Thanks, Attorney Bong.

728
00:48:15,099 --> 00:48:16,500
Blow out the candles.

729
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:29,179
What's wrong with you?
You surprised me.

730
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:31,679
You ruined my pretty face.

731
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:39,789
I thought your mom
would like to see you smile.

732
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:43,829
She would, right?

733
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:51,869
It's my mom's cake so I'll...

734
00:48:56,539 --> 00:48:57,969
Don't be silly.

735
00:48:57,969 --> 00:48:59,710
Okay. I'll wipe it off for you.

736
00:49:01,179 --> 00:49:02,340
There you go.

737
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,650
- Mr. Mayor.
- What?

738
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,750
Oh, I see.

739
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:18,219
You're here.

740
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:23,590
Did my guys make any mistakes
on your way here?

741
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:28,230
Since I'm in Kiseong,
I wanted to meet you anyway.

742
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:29,400
This is nice.

743
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:31,300
Please have a seat.

744
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:46,010
We've never met before,
but you look very familiar.

745
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:47,449
I do?

746
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:49,889
I feel the same say.

747
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:54,860
I heard so much about you
from Sang Pil when he was young.

748
00:50:56,059 --> 00:50:59,900
We'd make friends soon.

749
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:03,030
I think this is enough.

750
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:07,170
We should go have
some soju together later.

751
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:08,900
Okay?

752
00:51:09,269 --> 00:51:10,369
Friends?

753
00:51:11,469 --> 00:51:13,739
Okay. We can give it a try.

754
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:18,679
All right then.

755
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:21,579
Speaking of which,

756
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:25,949
you and I should...

757
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:28,090
settle things up.

758
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:32,260
Go back to Seoul...

759
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:35,599
with Bong Sang Pil.

760
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:38,900
He worked for
more than 18 years for this.

761
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,940
He wouldn't leave that easy.

762
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:44,409
I know what to do.

763
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,539
A contract.

764
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:54,179
It will settle things out.

765
00:51:59,389 --> 00:52:02,389
It's your dead body
that will settle things out.

766
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:05,429
You...

767
00:52:06,659 --> 00:52:07,900
And who was that?

768
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:12,969
The lady with a gavel.

769
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:22,380
Gosh.

770
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,519
We're not...

771
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,289
speaking the same language.

772
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:36,190
We're not going to be friends.

773
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,500
An Oh Ju.

774
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,170
You jerk.

775
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,840
Gosh, that's so efficacious.

776
00:53:30,309 --> 00:53:32,250
He didn't even last for 10 seconds.

777
00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:37,420
Make sure to take care of the rest.

778
00:53:37,849 --> 00:53:39,349
Yes, Mr. Mayor.

779
00:53:41,219 --> 00:53:42,260
Get rid of him.

780
00:53:58,510 --> 00:54:00,579
Thank you so much for today.

781
00:54:02,309 --> 00:54:03,480
I'll go in now.

782
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:16,989
You have a lot of
special events for me.

783
00:54:17,329 --> 00:54:18,659
Don't worry.

784
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:22,099
I'll protect you no matter what.

785
00:54:22,429 --> 00:54:24,599
Protect me from what?

786
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:27,070
So...

787
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,940
if something happens...

788
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:36,139
Sang Pil.

789
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:39,150
I'll come running to you.

790
00:54:40,019 --> 00:54:41,079
Okay?

791
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:42,849
Okay.

792
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:45,849
I'll see you tomorrow.

793
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:48,219
Bye.

794
00:55:01,969 --> 00:55:03,099
Hey.

795
00:55:04,369 --> 00:55:05,869
Wake up.

796
00:55:23,489 --> 00:55:24,690
You scumbag.

797
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:27,630
What do you think you're doing?

798
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:31,400
Your precious nephew,
Bong Sang Pil, is coming.

799
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:33,869
What?

800
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,610
He'd want to stay
by your deathbed.

801
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:41,039
Hey.

802
00:55:42,179 --> 00:55:43,380
Get ready.

803
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:53,289
(Lawless Law Firm)

804
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:55,619
You're here.

805
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:04,429
Hey, Bong Sang Pil.

806
00:56:06,369 --> 00:56:10,070
I think this happened before.

807
00:56:12,809 --> 00:56:13,809
Now...

808
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:19,309
your uncle is close to death.

809
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:21,179
What will you do?

810
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:23,789
Do you think
you can make it on time?

811
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:25,519
Sang Pil.

812
00:56:26,019 --> 00:56:28,159
You must not come!

813
00:56:29,389 --> 00:56:32,260
It's a trap. Sang Pil!

814
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:34,030
Don't come here!

815
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:38,230
Uncle Dae Woong!

816
00:56:42,469 --> 00:56:44,239
We'll get ready immediately.

817
00:56:44,309 --> 00:56:45,440
No.

818
00:56:46,539 --> 00:56:47,940
You stay and protect Attorney Ha.

819
00:56:51,409 --> 00:56:54,219
Protect me? What does that mean?

820
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:57,889
Nothing. I'll be right back.

821
00:56:58,989 --> 00:57:01,590
We talked about this.
You have to tell me everything.

822
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:04,360
I'll tell you later.

823
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,559
What is going on, Sang Pil?

824
00:57:08,329 --> 00:57:11,469
Grab Attorney Ha. Now!

825
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:12,929
I'm sorry, Attorney Ha.

826
00:57:13,539 --> 00:57:15,400
Let go of me. Bong Sang Pil!

827
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,699
Get off!

828
00:57:17,369 --> 00:57:20,679
Make sure to keep her safe
until I come back.

829
00:57:25,349 --> 00:57:27,519
Sang Pil!

830
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:30,190
Where are you going?
Get off me!

831
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:43,630
What are you doing
in front of the table?

832
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,630
Just eat.

833
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:47,699
The exam is close at hand.
How can I eat?

834
00:57:47,699 --> 00:57:51,469
You're a good fighter,
but why are you being a coward?

835
00:57:52,539 --> 00:57:54,610
I heard your teachers say...

836
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,610
that you'd get the top score.

837
00:57:58,250 --> 00:57:59,349
No way.

838
00:57:59,449 --> 00:58:01,179
My grade is nowhere
close to the top score.

839
00:58:03,519 --> 00:58:05,219
Once you pass the bar exam,

840
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:08,190
you'll quit fighting
as you promised. Okay?

841
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:11,360
Uncle Dae Woong. I've
given it a lot of thought.

842
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:14,960
I should be an attorney
using my fists instead.

843
00:58:16,099 --> 00:58:18,599
The world doesn't always work out
the way the law says after all.

844
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:22,269
You should use your fists
only when you have to.

845
00:58:23,239 --> 00:58:25,610
To protect your precious people.

846
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:28,409
Precious people?

847
00:58:28,409 --> 00:58:30,710
Do you know why I can't...

848
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:32,849
quit this crap?

849
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:37,750
It's so that I can protect you.

850
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:09,820
No... No.

851
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:37,809
Bong Sang Pil!

852
00:59:39,849 --> 00:59:41,480
Good luck saving your uncle.

853
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:54,260
Uncle Dae Woong!

854
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:04,139
No... No!

855
01:00:18,889 --> 01:00:19,989
I got you.

856
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:23,929
Let go, Sang Pil.

857
01:00:23,929 --> 01:00:26,630
I can't. No, I won't.

858
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:32,800
I'm already a dead man.

859
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:39,210
Uncle Dae Woong!

860
01:00:41,610 --> 01:00:43,579
You'll end up killing yourself too!

861
01:00:43,949 --> 01:00:45,079
Let go!

862
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:46,679
No.

863
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:48,719
Uncle Dae Woong,

864
01:00:49,519 --> 01:00:51,590
I ran leaving Mom behind.

865
01:00:53,690 --> 01:00:54,920
I won't...

866
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,530
ever do that again!

867
01:00:59,559 --> 01:01:01,300
Hold on.

868
01:01:03,199 --> 01:01:04,469
After I die,

869
01:01:06,429 --> 01:01:08,840
don't think about getting revenge.

870
01:01:11,409 --> 01:01:12,440
Sang Pil...

871
01:01:14,809 --> 01:01:16,909
Promise me you'll be a good lawyer.

872
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:19,980
Also,

873
01:01:24,349 --> 01:01:25,750
find happiness.

874
01:01:28,389 --> 01:01:29,489
Uncle Dae Woong!

875
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:31,789
No, don't!

876
01:01:31,789 --> 01:01:32,960
Don't let go!

877
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:36,159
No, no!

878
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:40,329
No, Uncle Dae Woong!

879
01:01:53,349 --> 01:01:54,519
Do you really not know?

880
01:01:54,849 --> 01:01:57,050
He kept me in the dark too.

881
01:01:57,219 --> 01:01:58,289
That's the truth.

882
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,039
You're under arrest for murder.

883
01:02:16,699 --> 01:02:18,440
You have the right
to have an attorney...

884
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:20,940
and the right to defend yourself.

885
01:02:22,139 --> 01:02:23,309
I have a bad feeling about this.

886
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:27,179
He only went alone
because it's dangerous.

887
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:29,880
We need to find him right now.

888
01:02:30,949 --> 01:02:32,519
Open up, it's us!

889
01:02:39,059 --> 01:02:40,659
What's going to happen
to Attorney Bong?

890
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,199
Turn on the news. Quickly!

891
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:44,400
- Hurry up!
- What?

892
01:02:46,670 --> 01:02:48,840
At a redevelopment area
in Kiseong,

893
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:51,440
a grotesque murder has occurred.

894
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,170
- What should we do?
- At an abandoned building...

895
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:54,340
in Chilhyeon-dong of Kiseong,

896
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:56,780
- a nephew stabbed his uncle...
- What are we going to do?

897
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:58,510
He then dropped his uncle...

898
01:02:58,510 --> 01:03:00,820
from the roof and ended his life.

899
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:05,449
Attorney Bong, the suspect,
is an ex-convict...

900
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:08,289
and is a known member of...

901
01:03:08,289 --> 01:03:10,789
the deceased's gang
known as Dae Woong Gang.

902
01:03:11,559 --> 01:03:16,329
The police suspect that
Attorney Bong has been...

903
01:03:16,329 --> 01:03:19,099
planning for a while
to murder his uncle...

904
01:03:19,099 --> 01:03:21,599
which only adds to
the shocking nature of the crime.

905
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,650
Oh, dear.

906
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:36,980
Bong Sang Pil...

907
01:03:41,389 --> 01:03:43,889
Now what will you do?

908
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,070
(Lawless Lawyer)

909
01:04:29,539 --> 01:04:30,969
Attorney Bong is innocent.

910
01:04:30,969 --> 01:04:32,309
You know very well yourself.

911
01:04:32,309 --> 01:04:35,280
The trial began
the moment he was arrested.

912
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,809
Don't tell me
you believe in coincidence.

913
01:04:37,949 --> 01:04:40,820
It's not coincidence,
but part of a well-known plan.

914
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:42,920
I'm sure there are
holes in their trap.

915
01:04:44,619 --> 01:04:47,150
Kiseong is my nest.

916
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:49,860
I'll kill those
that aren't loyal to me.

917
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:52,460
Don't do anything. That's an order.

918
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:57,030
What if Uncle Dae Woong
was planning on something?
