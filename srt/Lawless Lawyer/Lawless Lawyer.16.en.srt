00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,139
(Lawless Lawyer)

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,150
(Lee Joon Gi)

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,980
(Seo Yea Ji)

00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:17,859
(Lee Hye Young)

5
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,899
(Choi Min Su)

6
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:29,969
(Lawless Lawyer)

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,539
Go ahead.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,570
The Thai acupressurist.

9
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:36,640
It was me who...

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,179
Mom!

11
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,210
We'll take a short recess.

12
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:46,850
An Oh Ju changed his mind.

13
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,350
You get him back here.

14
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:49,719
Make him testify in court.

15
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,820
Secretary Kim has found us a ship.

16
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:53,960
Don't forget our money.

17
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,030
Of course not.

18
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:59,429
The APB has only been
lifted off for you and me,

19
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:01,229
so what about Secretary Kim?

20
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:02,869
Hi, Secretary Kim!

21
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,769
Thanks to Sang Pil,
we don't have to smuggle...

22
00:01:05,769 --> 00:01:08,469
ourselves out of the country.

23
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,909
You know Boss,

24
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:13,680
we shouldn't come back
to this darn country ever again.

25
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:20,790
Was it Cha Moon Sook?

26
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,159
Remove it, Secretary Kim.

27
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,159
Remove it!

28
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:35,299
You scum!

29
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:47,310
An Oh Ju. An Oh Ju!

30
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,290
Oh, gosh.

31
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,090
Now that hurts.

32
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,730
You weasel, who ordered this?

33
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,330
Couldn't you come a little sooner?

34
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:48,539
Darn it.

35
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:53,139
I should've never
gotten involved with you.

36
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,180
Anyway,

37
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,219
I hope you make it out alive.

38
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,300
Seok Gwan Dong.

39
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,740
Seok Gwan Dong!

40
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,270
Wake up!

41
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,229
The trial.

42
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:45,199
How is it going?

43
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,030
It's in recess.

44
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,539
Cha Moon Sook ordered the hit...

45
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:00,139
to stop you from testifying.

46
00:04:14,289 --> 00:04:15,530
I know that too,

47
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,529
Bong Sang Pil.

48
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,589
Can I still get an opportunity
to testify in court?

49
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,420
Yes.

50
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,569
All right, then.

51
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,329
(Final Episode)

52
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,470
Judge Cha.

53
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,610
What's going on?
I told you not to call me.

54
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:38,910
The thing is...

55
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:42,350
I couldn't get rid of An Oh Ju.

56
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,620
Bong Sang Pil showed up
out of the blue.

57
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,420
I'm sorry.

58
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:51,060
Find An Oh Ju immediately.

59
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,870
I had no idea what to do earlier.

60
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,839
I couldn't think
of the right answer.

61
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:10,610
I was trying to buy time.

62
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:14,050
Avoiding it won't solve the problem.

63
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,480
By the way,

64
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:21,790
how did you know Judge Cha would
try to win me over to her side?

65
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:24,459
I figured she'd do that
based on what Attorney Bong and I...

66
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:25,959
know about her.

67
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,029
You mustn't trust her
even for a second.

68
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,560
That woman, Cha Moon Sook.

69
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,769
What happened with An Oh Ju?

70
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:39,170
Well, don't worry.

71
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,040
What Cha Moon Sook wants
will not happen.

72
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,509
What does that mean?

73
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:45,709
Are you saying...

74
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,579
An Oh Ju will testify in court?

75
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:50,920
That's right.

76
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,120
You'll definitely see him
in the courtroom.

77
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,060
It's about time
you made up your mind.

78
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,089
What will you do?

79
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,459
An Oh Ju...

80
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,769
That man, An Oh Ju,

81
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:12,540
will actually appear in court?

82
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:15,269
Look, Nam Soon Ja.

83
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,180
This is your last chance.

84
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,649
This time, you'd better
choose which side to take...

85
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,980
very wisely.

86
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:31,790
- Good work.
- Thank you.

87
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,889
Here you go, sir.

88
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,199
I'll be off, then.

89
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,689
Judge Geum Kang is entering.
All rise.

90
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:09,959
Hello, everyone.

91
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,959
Hey, stand up.

92
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,759
What are you doing
in this honorable court?

93
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,029
Yes, Your Honor!

94
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:16,069
All right, then.

95
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,970
Everyone, please be seated.

96
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,670
All right, we'll begin the trial.

97
00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:23,269
Attorney, please give us your plea.

98
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,810
An extremely unfair ruling
was made recently.

99
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:29,110
Apparently, some people's
prison labor is worth...

100
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,279
500,000 dollars per day.

101
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,120
A man spent 49 days in prison
and got 24.5 million dollars...

102
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,049
deducted from his fines.

103
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:37,759
- Gosh.
- That's crazy.

104
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:40,419
- Hey, Bong Sang Pil.
- Yes.

105
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,289
Are you writing a novel or what?

106
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,200
Can you prove it?

107
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,000
Can you bet on your law license?

108
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,830
Yes, I'll bet on my license.

109
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,340
I'll shut down my firm
after this trial if I lose.

110
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,470
If that's the case,

111
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,610
you won this trial. Court dismissed.

112
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,480
- How did it go, Boss?
- Would you like some of this?

113
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,919
Come have a seat here.

114
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,080
Keep doing what you were doing.

115
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,350
It looks like you guys can handle
trials as attorneys.

116
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,649
I'm curious about something.

117
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:13,659
What if Cha Moon Sook
keeps denying what she did?

118
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:15,289
What's going to happen then?

119
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,529
What do you think?

120
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:18,899
She'll end up
with a heavier sentence.

121
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,570
In court, whether the person
is remorseful or not...

122
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:25,870
is the most important factor
in deciding his or her sentence.

123
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:30,309
Then let's say there's a witness
but no evidence.

124
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,639
What will happen, then?

125
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:34,580
You can think that
testimonies are just like evidence.

126
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,179
People's statements can be
accepted as evidence as well.

127
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:41,120
But people can lie
when they're bribed...

128
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,419
or threatened.

129
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:46,090
Testimonies can be tainted
just like forged evidence.

130
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,360
Just like how we verify
the credibility of evidence,

131
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,759
we must thoroughly check
and make sure...

132
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:54,629
all statements are consistent
and that the facts check out.

133
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:57,370
In other words,
you just need a credible witness.

134
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,600
That's correct.

135
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,009
That's why we're trying to persuade
An Oh Ju to appear in court.

136
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:05,279
Then we'll have to bring
An Oh Ju no matter what.

137
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,279
That's right.

138
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:10,009
We'll also have to make sure the
trial can be seen by many people.

139
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,649
That way, Cha Moon Sook
won't be able to get her way.

140
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:17,620
I'll meet up with Reporter Yu
Kyeong Jin and talk to her about it.

141
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,019
Sure, okay.

142
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:21,789
What are you going to do?

143
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:23,659
I have to go somewhere now.

144
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,360
I'll see you all later.

145
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:31,370
Why did you tell Scorpion not to
spill out Cha Moon Sook's name?

146
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:35,169
Because my goal was
to make Nam Soon Ja say it herself.

147
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:40,480
Oh, right. I heard you summoned
An Oh Ju as a witness.

148
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,149
Do you think he'll come?

149
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:45,779
The APB on him has been lifted, but
he still can't leave the country.

150
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:47,919
He'll get caught eventually.

151
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,620
Actually,

152
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:53,059
there's something I want to ask you.

153
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,000
Will you bring
Attorney Ha's mother to court?

154
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,429
That...

155
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,330
will depend on how
Cha Moon Sook responds.

156
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,279
Yeon Hee.

157
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:16,110
I had no idea I'd end up
jeopardizing your career like this.

158
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,149
Mom.

159
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:20,789
You should've apologized
to Judge Cha and begged her.

160
00:11:21,549 --> 00:11:23,320
What is this mess? Answer me.

161
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:24,820
Look at yourself.

162
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,120
Yeon Hee.

163
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:29,360
Judge Cha dumped everything on me.

164
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,200
I just did what I was told to do.

165
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,070
What did you say to me, Mom?

166
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:36,899
You told me to go higher
than where Judge Cha is.

167
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:40,600
How will I be able to do that
when my mom is an ex-convict?

168
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:42,909
Do you think it's possible?

169
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:45,279
Yeon Hee.

170
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,809
Forget Bong Sang Pil. He's useless.

171
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,080
I'll meet Judge Cha in person...

172
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,490
and beg her on my knees.

173
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,919
She's the only person...

174
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,490
who can get you out of here.

175
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,159
Yeon Hee, Yeon Hee!

176
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:15,009
What kind of bomb
did you bring today?

177
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:18,879
I brought the truth,
not a bomb.

178
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:21,549
Everything will be revealed
in this trial.

179
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:23,110
You mean Nam Soon Ja's trial?

180
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,250
Correct.

181
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,350
All the ugly things Cha Moon Sook
has been concealing...

182
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,789
will be revealed.

183
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:31,490
Hearing that...

184
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,190
is making me wonder
how hard you and Attorney Bong...

185
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:37,559
must've had to work for the trial.

186
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,360
I have a favor to ask.

187
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,370
Please bring other reporters
to court.

188
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,940
We'll need
foreign reporters as well.

189
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,240
Foreign press too?

190
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,340
We need to bring outsiders
to make sure that the truth...

191
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,009
isn't manipulated in any way.

192
00:12:51,309 --> 00:12:53,240
Okay, got it.

193
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:57,309
I'll see you in court, then.

194
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:58,450
All right.

195
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:17,070
Madam Nam, how are you feeling?

196
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:20,340
What brings you here, ma'am?

197
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,169
What kind of question is that?

198
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:25,440
She's obviously here because
she's been worried about you.

199
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,379
What did Bong Sang Pil say to you?

200
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:30,879
Did he say that An Oh Ju
will appear in court as a witness?

201
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,149
Pardon?

202
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:35,149
There's no way
An Oh Ju will come to court.

203
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:38,289
He's fully aware of what will
happen to him if he comes to court.

204
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,789
He absolutely can't come.

205
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:43,259
Bong Sang Pil...

206
00:13:43,629 --> 00:13:46,230
is fooling you.

207
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:48,730
He's telling you complete nonsense.

208
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,070
Madam Nam.

209
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:58,909
Don't believe anything
Bong Sang Pil tells you.

210
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:02,950
He's not the one
who sincerely cares about you.

211
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,789
I think you have her completely.

212
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:17,059
No.

213
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,529
I don't trust her.

214
00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:22,200
Pardon?

215
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:24,940
An Oh Ju and Nam Soon Ja both...

216
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:28,110
need to be incapacitated.

217
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,279
I understand, ma'am.

218
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:35,179
(Lawless Law Firm)

219
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,679
Okay.

220
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,789
- Really? I understand.
- Gong Jang Soo, chief prosecutor.

221
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:43,690
Both requested as witnesses.

222
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,659
Cha Moon Sook summoned
Go In Du as a witness.

223
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,460
Judge's authority.

224
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,600
The two want to collude
and corner Nam Soon Ja.

225
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:59,340
She has no reason to back down.

226
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,769
She'll reduce An Oh Ju
and Nam Soon Ja's credibility...

227
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:05,840
To cast doubt on
the witness' testimony.

228
00:15:08,049 --> 00:15:09,049
Hello?

229
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:16,049
You complete
the final picture of this court.

230
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:19,320
I always created my own court.

231
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:21,019
Nothing will change.

232
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,350
An Oh Ju...

233
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,690
never intended
to take the witness stand.

234
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,490
And he never will.

235
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:31,230
This will be your
last trial as a judge.

236
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,200
Your Honor.

237
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:56,049
Reporter Yu, it's an important day.
We trust you'll help us out.

238
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:01,429
You're guaranteed a scoop today.

239
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,590
- Look forward to it.
- Thanks.

240
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,460
Thank you for your cooperation.
Thank you.

241
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,730
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

242
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,230
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

243
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:15,640
Are you okay?

244
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:28,119
Are you two on
different pages today?

245
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:35,190
Yeon Hee saw the state I'm in and
still can't get away from Judge Cha.

246
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,359
She's well and truly caught.

247
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:41,900
It all depends on
what you do today in court.

248
00:17:43,269 --> 00:17:44,500
Make up your mind.

249
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,500
Don't let Cha Moon Sook control you.

250
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,309
Witness, introduce yourself.

251
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,049
I'm Gong Jang Soo, the investigator
on Nam Joon Ja's case.

252
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:04,589
Kill her?

253
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,059
Yes.

254
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:13,430
You won't take me seriously?

255
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:16,930
My word is the judge's word!

256
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,069
It's the judge's order!

257
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:23,670
The video of Nam Soon Ja
ordering murder.

258
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:26,009
How likely is it that it was faked?

259
00:18:26,009 --> 00:18:27,809
The NFS concluded that...

260
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,880
the clip shows no signs
of being tampered with.

261
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:40,289
Your Honor, I submit
the NFS report as evidence.

262
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,660
Defense, cross-examine the witness.

263
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,299
Yes.

264
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,130
Your Honor.

265
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,109
I believe this video
kick-started the investigation.

266
00:18:55,569 --> 00:18:56,710
That's right.

267
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,579
Where was it from?

268
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,279
Chief Prosecutor Jang Sa Ik...

269
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:07,019
gave it to the team.

270
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,549
The chief prosecutor gave it to you?

271
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:10,720
That's correct.

272
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:17,190
I believe you were a detective
for over 30 years.

273
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:21,059
How common is it for someone
like the chief prosecutor...

274
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:22,730
to report a case?

275
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,230
It almost never happens.

276
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,339
Where did the chief prosecutor
say he got it from?

277
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,579
He did not say so.

278
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:36,049
Is it common for one
to hide the source?

279
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,809
Defense.

280
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:46,259
Stick to facts surrounding the case.

281
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,029
The witness' personal experiences...

282
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:51,700
have nothing to do with this trial.

283
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:54,869
Then I request Chief Prosecutor
Jang Sa Ik...

284
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:58,240
as a witness as he provided
the video evidence.

285
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,940
Request accepted.

286
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,710
Chief Prosecutor.

287
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,509
Take the stand.

288
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:21,220
You refused to
swear in as a witness.

289
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:29,230
Where did you get the video
of Nam Soon Ja ordering the murder?

290
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:36,869
From an anonymous informant.

291
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,849
You want to hide
the person's identity.

292
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:46,420
Why would you, a chief prosecutor
wish to take the stand...

293
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:49,390
to protect this informant?

294
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,059
Could it be that...

295
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:58,329
this person is
more powerful than you?

296
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,529
Attorney Bong.

297
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:04,369
You should watch your manners.

298
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:09,170
You're in the sacred witness stand
so answer on your conscience.

299
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:11,069
Defense.

300
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:15,049
What are you getting at?

301
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:22,690
In the previous hearing,
our witness said this.

302
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:28,259
The dead victim said someone's name.

303
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:33,259
It sounded like someone high up.

304
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:36,329
"It sounded like someone high up."

305
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,170
I'm trying to find a common thread
between the testimonies.

306
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:43,470
You provided the prosecutors
with evidence...

307
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:47,380
on An Oh Ju's
illegal campaign funds.

308
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:51,150
You said then again it was from
an anonymous informant.

309
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:56,089
Who is this anonymous informant
who would give...

310
00:21:56,089 --> 00:21:58,220
the chief prosecutor
such crucial evidence?

311
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:01,690
Who is this informant...

312
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,700
that you're trying
so hard to protect?

313
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:08,769
I will not answer.

314
00:22:11,869 --> 00:22:15,269
That informant's identity...

315
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:17,509
will be revealed in court today.

316
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,079
You'd better stay...

317
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:24,079
until the very end.

318
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:28,549
That is all.

319
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:35,089
We'll begin the questioning
of the defendant Nam Soon Ja.

320
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:38,799
Defendant, take the stand.

321
00:22:53,309 --> 00:22:54,880
I have a question for you.

322
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:56,480
Okay.

323
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:01,119
Do you know clearly
what this trial is about?

324
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:03,920
It's about the illegal
detainment and...

325
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,319
abetting the murder
of a Thai acupressurist.

326
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:11,599
Did you yourself order
the acupressurist be killed?

327
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,609
Answer.

328
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,440
Did you solicit to murder?

329
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:40,690
Yes. I did it.

330
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:44,630
- She did it?
- How could she?

331
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,369
The defendant just admitted
to soliciting to murder.

332
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:55,609
Are you aware
what the penalty is for that?

333
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:00,210
According to Article 31
Clause 1 of the Penal Code,

334
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:02,509
and Article 250 Clause 1
of the Penal Code,

335
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:05,779
soliciting to murder receives
the same sentence as murder.

336
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:07,880
Did you know that?

337
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:11,759
Yes, my attorney told me.

338
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,829
Since the defendant
admitted her crimes,

339
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:19,529
questioning her further
seems pointless.

340
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:23,970
Prosecution,
if you won't cross-examine,

341
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:29,170
then we'll end her testimony here.

342
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,440
- I will cross-examine.
- Not so fast.

343
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,750
Your Honor.

344
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:46,190
The defendant admitted her guilt.

345
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,490
What more do you need to ask her?

346
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:51,700
Well, there's one
important question left.

347
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,569
Carry on.

348
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:04,069
Did you do this all on your own?

349
00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:13,980
That concludes the testimony of...

350
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,990
Answer me.

351
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:18,220
Did you do this all on your own?

352
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:23,289
I was...

353
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,200
following orders.

354
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,230
What?

355
00:25:31,569 --> 00:25:32,769
All I did...

356
00:25:33,769 --> 00:25:35,240
was follow those orders.

357
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:37,240
That's right.

358
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,779
I didn't do this on my own.

359
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:48,150
You're saying that it wasn't
your idea to commit murder.

360
00:25:49,819 --> 00:25:52,690
The witness at the last trial
mentioned a name.

361
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:55,160
Is it that person who...

362
00:25:55,829 --> 00:25:57,289
- ordered the hit?
- Mr. Bong.

363
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:58,299
Yes,

364
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,500
it's the same person.

365
00:26:06,269 --> 00:26:09,509
Why haven't you mentioned
this person up until now?

366
00:26:09,509 --> 00:26:10,509
Defense Attorney,

367
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:16,180
do not lead the witness
with your questions.

368
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:17,779
I was scared.

369
00:26:19,349 --> 00:26:21,789
What were you so terrified of?

370
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,619
Power.

371
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,059
Power?

372
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,829
If you have power,

373
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,470
the truth and the lies...

374
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:39,299
can be covered up.

375
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:46,809
Is that person of power
in this very courtroom?

376
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:59,960
Yes, that person is here.

377
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:05,130
The most powerful person
in all of Kiseong.

378
00:27:06,329 --> 00:27:08,529
It's Judge Cha Moon Sook.

379
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:11,839
What?

380
00:27:12,269 --> 00:27:14,599
Guys, just write what you heard!

381
00:27:15,869 --> 00:27:17,039
Go ahead.

382
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,779
You heard the woman,
so write it down.

383
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:23,210
Come on.

384
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:31,420
Goodness.

385
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,019
Order!

386
00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:35,960
Order.

387
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,500
Keep order or
I'll hold you in contempt.

388
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:44,470
The stenographers will erase
what the witness just said.

389
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,799
Judge Cha Moon Sook.

390
00:27:47,869 --> 00:27:49,710
Did you order the hit?

391
00:27:53,009 --> 00:27:54,410
I'll ask you again.

392
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,480
Judge Cha Moon Sook.

393
00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:59,180
Did you order the hit?

394
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:03,789
If neither side wishes
to ask more questions,

395
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,259
then we'll conclude her testimony.

396
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:09,559
The defendant
may return to her seat.

397
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:23,410
Regarding this case,

398
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:25,140
there's a brave witness...

399
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:28,180
who is willing to come forward.

400
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:33,349
As the presiding judge,
I'll allow this witness to testify.

401
00:28:33,549 --> 00:28:34,779
Attorney Go In Du.

402
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,890
Please take the stand.

403
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:51,839
What information will
you share with us?

404
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:55,609
I was the legal adviser for...

405
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:57,809
former Mayor An's Ohju Group.

406
00:28:58,309 --> 00:29:01,140
I'm here today
to reveal the crimes committed...

407
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,450
by Nam Soon Ja.

408
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:06,450
She pressured An Oh Ju...

409
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:10,690
to add the land she owns
into the Golden City district...

410
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:14,420
while posing as
one of Judge Cha's...

411
00:29:15,089 --> 00:29:16,690
closest ally.

412
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:22,029
So that's what she was doing...

413
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:25,900
when she referred to me...

414
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:30,240
in the evidence video
presented by the defense.

415
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:31,980
That's right.

416
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:38,079
Your Honor, I have evidence
to back up my claims.

417
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,680
Sure.

418
00:29:42,589 --> 00:29:45,220
The area set to be developed...

419
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,289
as a part of
the Golden City project...

420
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:50,059
was changed to include her land.

421
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:56,400
During this process,

422
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:59,000
did An Oh Ju and Nam Soon Ja...

423
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,039
obtain a significant amount
of financial gain?

424
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:03,039
Yes.

425
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:06,440
A huge shopping mall
is set to be built there,

426
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,480
so the plus-value alone
is at least 10 million dollars.

427
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:17,420
You, Go In Du, your land
is part of that area too.

428
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:20,190
What you own is right next to mine!

429
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:22,089
That's a groundless claim.

430
00:30:22,329 --> 00:30:24,730
Defendant, please sit.

431
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:48,079
Here's the man who'll
clear all of this up for us.

432
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:50,089
I call An Oh Ju to the stand.

433
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,900
Will the defense and the prosecution
please approach?

434
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,440
What does the prosecution say?

435
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,109
We already requested him
as a witness too.

436
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,079
All right.

437
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:19,880
Do you really think that...

438
00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:23,019
I won't be able
to squash his testimony?

439
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:24,750
Judge Cha,

440
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,990
no matter how you hide the truth,

441
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:30,059
it will always be revealed.

442
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:35,059
You'll soon find out why
I had An Oh Ju...

443
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,369
step inside this courtroom,

444
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:43,940
Your Honor.

445
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,750
I'll allow the witness.

446
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,559
I'll take the oath.

447
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:03,289
I, An Oh Ju,

448
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:08,029
swear by my conscience
that I shall give the truth,

449
00:32:09,099 --> 00:32:11,630
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.

450
00:32:13,569 --> 00:32:16,109
If any of what I say is a lie,

451
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:19,109
I will accept the charges...

452
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:22,250
of perjury.

453
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,660
How will you reveal the truth
pertinent to this case?

454
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:38,730
My entire life of 50 years...

455
00:32:39,329 --> 00:32:41,000
is in fact...

456
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:43,730
living proof.

457
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,940
Can you elaborate on
what you mean by that?

458
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,579
Before that,

459
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:58,180
I'd like a glass of water.

460
00:33:17,369 --> 00:33:18,630
Since the days...

461
00:33:19,269 --> 00:33:21,099
when Judge Cha Moon Sook's
father,

462
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,410
Judge Cha Byung Ho, was alive,

463
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:26,309
I've been like her family's...

464
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:29,809
loyal dog.

465
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,750
- What?
- A dog?

466
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,990
The defense attorney is...

467
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:40,920
hindering the trial by asking
the witness questions that are...

468
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,529
- completely unrelated to the case.
- That's not true.

469
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:49,000
An Oh Ju's testimony
is absolutely necessary...

470
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,799
for us to gauge the credibility...

471
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,400
of the defendant's statements.

472
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,710
Please allow the defense attorney
to continue, Your Honor.

473
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:01,809
You may continue.

474
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:06,619
Witness An Oh Ju.

475
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,260
The former mayor of Kiseong,
Lee Young Soo,

476
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:15,360
the owner of Daejak Gallery,
Choi Dae Woong,

477
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,460
Detective Wu Hyung Man,

478
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:20,500
the union president
for Golden City who is said...

479
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,300
to have gone missing 18 years ago,

480
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:26,340
and Lawyer Choi Jin Ae.

481
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,469
You confessed to me...

482
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:34,340
that you either murdered
or hired others to murder...

483
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,449
all aforementioned people...

484
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:39,019
as per Judge Cha Moon Sook's order.

485
00:34:41,849 --> 00:34:42,920
Is it true?

486
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,389
Yes, it is true.

487
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:58,030
Judge Cha Moon Sook,
who's sitting up there now,

488
00:34:58,769 --> 00:35:01,139
gave me the orders directly.

489
00:35:03,539 --> 00:35:06,880
Like a hound, I killed whomever
she asked me to get rid of...

490
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,380
and buried whomever
she wanted me to bury.

491
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,820
Here's a recording
of the phone conversation...

492
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,219
with the witness' statement.

493
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,230
I'd like to submit it as evidence.

494
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:27,159
From the testimonies we've heard,

495
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:29,199
it seems highly likely
that the witness...

496
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:32,539
was the defendant's accomplice.

497
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,809
Defense Attorney, have you
ever doubted his credibility?

498
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,940
They could've coordinated
their stories in advance...

499
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:41,710
to frame an innocent person.

500
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,250
Please have a look at this photo.

501
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,260
Attorney Bong Sang Pil.

502
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:57,659
How dare you bring a manipulated
photo to court as evidence?

503
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,559
Fine.

504
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:03,130
We'll say that the photo of you
was manipulated.

505
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:06,940
Mr. An Oh Ju.

506
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:11,309
That photo was disclosed recently
through the media.

507
00:36:12,309 --> 00:36:13,579
Are you the man in the photo?

508
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:25,320
Yes, it's me.

509
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,659
Then what about
that person inside the car?

510
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:32,559
Who is she?

511
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,570
It's the judge...

512
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,699
who's sitting
in the judge's bench at the moment,

513
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:45,469
Judge Cha Moon Sook.

514
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:52,880
So that means...

515
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,650
the photo wasn't manipulated, right?

516
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:58,050
- Attorney Bong.
- Let me change the question.

517
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:01,519
Could you please tell us
about the situation?

518
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:17,269
Well, Judge Cha Moon Sook...

519
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,639
who's sitting up there now...

520
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:26,250
hit someone with her car.

521
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,920
She called me right away...

522
00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:33,659
and told me to take care
of the body.

523
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:43,969
How can we believe
what the witness is saying?

524
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:47,469
They're just his words.

525
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:49,969
How can you prove it?

526
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:52,210
Your Honor, do you really think...

527
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,440
that there's no way
to prove his claim?

528
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,349
What do we have here now?

529
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,820
A testimony that lacks credibility
and a manipulated photo.

530
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:04,320
What else is there?

531
00:38:14,699 --> 00:38:16,400
We have someone who can prove it...

532
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:20,239
right here in this courtroom now.

533
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:25,469
Attorney Ha, is this a joke or what?

534
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:37,719
It's...

535
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,619
that lady over there.

536
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,880
It's the victim, Noh Hyun Joo,

537
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:04,110
the acupressurist who used to
work at your residence...

538
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,849
and was known
to have been abducted and killed.

539
00:39:09,619 --> 00:39:10,719
That photo...

540
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:13,889
was taken by her...

541
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:15,989
at the scene.

542
00:39:19,099 --> 00:39:20,159
Ms. Noh Hyun Joo is...

543
00:39:21,699 --> 00:39:25,599
the only witness of the case,
which happened 18 years ago.

544
00:39:28,139 --> 00:39:29,139
And...

545
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:32,739
she's my mother.

546
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:34,239
She's her mother?

547
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,130
The person who ordered
the abduction of my mother...

548
00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:00,099
was Judge Cha Moon Sook.

549
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,340
It was your doing.

550
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:10,010
Judge Cha attempted to kill Ms. Noh
several times.

551
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:14,880
We rescued her
and have been protecting her.

552
00:40:16,349 --> 00:40:18,820
All because of you,
Judge Cha Moon Sook!

553
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:23,829
What do you say now?
Are you still going to claim...

554
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,829
that you're not guilty?

555
00:40:27,829 --> 00:40:29,099
We will...

556
00:40:30,099 --> 00:40:31,869
take a recess here.

557
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,670
Judge Cha, sit down.

558
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:38,239
Sit back down!

559
00:40:50,349 --> 00:40:53,059
Judge Cha, please tell us the truth!

560
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,230
What's the truth?

561
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:58,960
Tell us the truth.

562
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:02,570
- Please tell us.
- Judge Cha, this isn't right.

563
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:04,000
- Tell us!
- We want the truth!

564
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,900
- Please say something.
- Judge Cha, tell us the truth!

565
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,300
- Tell us!
- What's the truth?

566
00:41:11,909 --> 00:41:13,679
How about now? Still?

567
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,349
Do you think...

568
00:41:16,809 --> 00:41:20,150
that you'll never be judged
even if you've committed crimes?

569
00:41:26,989 --> 00:41:28,159
The prosecution...

570
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:31,659
would like to examine
the new findings...

571
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:36,199
and put in a request
to amend the indictment,

572
00:41:36,929 --> 00:41:38,670
so we'd like you to stop...

573
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,000
the trial procedures.

574
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,309
I used to be the mayor of this city,
you know.

575
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:26,880
Let me have a smoke at least
before we leave.

576
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:28,119
Sure.

577
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:09,690
Boss.

578
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,530
- Bad news.
- What is it?

579
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:14,059
An Oh Ju got away during transfer.

580
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:16,429
- What?
- The police are chasing him.

581
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,400
What is he thinking?

582
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,239
I have an idea.

583
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:25,039
Kwang Soo, stay with Attorney Ha.

584
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:30,880
Attorney Bong, be safe.

585
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:38,119
An Oh Ju, drop the gun.

586
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,320
Why would I do that?

587
00:43:47,329 --> 00:43:48,659
An Oh Ju!

588
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:50,670
Is that you, Bong Sang Pil?

589
00:43:55,469 --> 00:43:57,969
Listen up, Sang Pil.

590
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,139
An Oh Ju.

591
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,679
I know what you're thinking.

592
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:06,650
Was the great An Oh Ju...

593
00:44:07,579 --> 00:44:10,619
a coward who just runs away?

594
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,820
You can't die here.

595
00:44:15,789 --> 00:44:17,829
Let the law punish you for...

596
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:20,300
all the crimes you committed.

597
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,960
What, "The law"?

598
00:44:22,929 --> 00:44:24,269
"The law"?

599
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,500
My whole life...

600
00:44:27,469 --> 00:44:31,840
I slaved away for the men
and women of the law.

601
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:34,110
Look what happened to me.

602
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:38,150
From now on, An Oh Ju...

603
00:44:38,849 --> 00:44:42,949
Me, An Oh Ju will take over!

604
00:44:42,949 --> 00:44:46,519
You won't be able to shoot me!

605
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:48,960
Do you hear me?

606
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,739
You talk about the law.

607
00:45:00,699 --> 00:45:03,039
The people you loved.

608
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:05,570
What happened to them?

609
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:07,679
Your mom.

610
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,880
Choi Dae Woong.

611
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:15,179
You lived in pain your whole life.

612
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,949
Shut your mouth, you worthless scum!

613
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:28,960
Your... Your mom...

614
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,800
will be looking down on you
and feel such pain.

615
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:42,409
No, Sang Pil.

616
00:45:42,409 --> 00:45:45,050
Pull that trigger
and you lose to him!

617
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:50,420
Yes, Sang Pil.

618
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:53,119
Let's end it here.

619
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,219
Pull the trigger.

620
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,090
Pull it.

621
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:01,559
- Shoot.
- An Oh Ju!

622
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:13,210
An Oh Ju.

623
00:46:15,079 --> 00:46:17,409
For the past 18 years,

624
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:22,219
I lived each day
in the pain of death.

625
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,719
Do you think...

626
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:28,590
I would listen to the likes of you?

627
00:46:38,369 --> 00:46:41,599
I won't get your
dirty blood on my hands.

628
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,280
I will...

629
00:46:51,579 --> 00:46:54,019
take you down with the law.

630
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:03,730
Will you hide behind the law
to the very end?

631
00:47:12,369 --> 00:47:13,699
Bong Sang Pil.

632
00:47:16,539 --> 00:47:17,940
This is...

633
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,409
the seaside where I was born.

634
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:25,179
It's my mother...

635
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,050
and my father.

636
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,719
The fish market.

637
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:34,760
This is where I was born.

638
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,730
It's right that I die here.

639
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,159
Yes.

640
00:47:41,929 --> 00:47:44,030
With your great law,

641
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,800
you can judge...

642
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:49,570
Cha Moon Sook.

643
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,610
That's my final request.

644
00:47:53,639 --> 00:47:55,639
Did you hear me, Sang Pil?

645
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:22,340
(Cha Moon Sook, Judge)

646
00:48:55,469 --> 00:48:58,909
Cha Moon Sook, you're under arrest
for abetting murder.

647
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:07,480
You have the right to an attorney
and can defend yourself.

648
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,750
Don't touch me.

649
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:13,820
The only person
who can take me outside...

650
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,190
is me myself.

651
00:49:18,929 --> 00:49:20,400
So step aside.

652
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:38,550
Judge Cha Moon Sook was
arrested in her residence today.

653
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:42,519
In Nam Soon Ja's trial in which
she was the presiding judge,

654
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:45,820
the truth about her crimes came out,
shocking everyone.

655
00:49:46,019 --> 00:49:48,019
Prosecutors
investigated the charges...

656
00:49:48,019 --> 00:49:50,760
and found others who were involved.

657
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,659
The scope of the investigation
has expanded.

658
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:56,300
Ohju Group's legal counsel and...

659
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,670
head attorney of Jeongeum Law firm,

660
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:01,469
Go In Du worked in Kiseong
for decades.

661
00:50:01,639 --> 00:50:04,010
He's suspected of bribing judges...

662
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:06,139
to get lower sentences
for his clients.

663
00:50:06,139 --> 00:50:09,579
Editor-in-chief Han of Kiseong Daily
is suspected of receiving a gift...

664
00:50:09,579 --> 00:50:13,380
of a trip worth 200,000 dollars
to lobby for The Golden City.

665
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,780
Prosecutors had him
brought in today as well.

666
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:19,320
Kiseong's Chief Prosecutor
Jang Sa Ik...

667
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,420
suffered being questioned
on charges of bribery...

668
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:24,530
- and abuse of power.
- Hands off me.

669
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:29,230
This case is so huge it's
being called the Cha-Nam gate,

670
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:30,670
and influential people...

671
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:32,130
Here, Sang Pil.

672
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,239
Are you ready?

673
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:36,969
Yes.

674
00:50:37,239 --> 00:50:40,880
I'm ready to reveal my past.

675
00:50:42,579 --> 00:50:44,880
(Request to reopen Choi Jin Ae's
suicide investigation)

676
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:53,019
You can take my past now.

677
00:50:55,059 --> 00:50:56,219
There's quite a lot.

678
00:50:57,289 --> 00:51:01,929
I want you to add this charge
to what you have on Cha Moon Sook.

679
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:05,199
This should be enough
to get you to reopen the case.

680
00:51:06,969 --> 00:51:11,070
My mom's case
was where it all began.

681
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:12,570
Okay, Sang Pil.

682
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,449
It started as revenge
but ended with justice.

683
00:51:26,389 --> 00:51:27,460
Mom.

684
00:51:28,289 --> 00:51:29,619
It's okay.

685
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:32,190
I'll start over.

686
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:35,230
A fresh start.

687
00:51:36,869 --> 00:51:37,869
Okay.

688
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:41,969
You were a smart kid.

689
00:51:42,469 --> 00:51:43,670
You'll do fine.

690
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:46,579
You aren't like me.

691
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:53,820
I will watch
how you do all the way.

692
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:58,289
Yeon Hee.

693
00:52:24,849 --> 00:52:27,280
I really didn't want
to see you guys.

694
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,250
Why did you want to see me?

695
00:52:30,989 --> 00:52:34,119
You finally left the bench...

696
00:52:35,059 --> 00:52:38,329
and became a mere human being.
How do you feel now?

697
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:40,260
"A mere human being"?

698
00:52:41,929 --> 00:52:43,269
"I left the bench"?

699
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:48,039
Did I?

700
00:52:50,139 --> 00:52:51,340
Where am I, Jae I?

701
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:58,750
I've seen ugly faces
and inner sides of people...

702
00:53:01,449 --> 00:53:04,650
for the past 40 years.

703
00:53:05,619 --> 00:53:08,989
I've reformed and judged
them the whole time.

704
00:53:14,059 --> 00:53:15,860
What you did to me...

705
00:53:18,099 --> 00:53:19,300
It's just stupid.

706
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:20,300
No.

707
00:53:20,769 --> 00:53:22,940
Your greed and hypocrisy...

708
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:26,210
drove a lot of people to tragedy.

709
00:53:27,639 --> 00:53:28,739
I'll just...

710
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:31,309
bring you to face the law...

711
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:34,420
for those people.

712
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,989
As a human being,

713
00:53:38,849 --> 00:53:41,360
you should've asked for
our forgiveness first.

714
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:45,059
I'll give you one last chance.

715
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:57,510
Bong Sang Pil and Ha Jae I.

716
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:01,780
You will eventually forgive me.

717
00:54:03,809 --> 00:54:06,750
It's you who will be suffering
if you don't.

718
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:11,590
She doesn't know
how things are going now.

719
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:17,190
Cha Moon Sook still believes
that the world revolves around her.

720
00:54:18,489 --> 00:54:21,559
Cha Moon Sook has never lost
her power since she was born.

721
00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:24,599
To be more exact,

722
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:28,039
she doesn't even have
the awareness about her power.

(Noh Hyun Joo)

724
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:06,409
Moon Sook is my friend.

725
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:10,949
I told you that for a reason.

726
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:14,079
I wanted to be prepared.

727
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:16,219
Attorney Choi.

728
00:55:16,949 --> 00:55:20,559
Thank you for giving me this.

729
00:55:21,789 --> 00:55:25,829
It will eventually help my friend.

730
00:55:31,929 --> 00:55:35,599
Your son seems quite reliable.

731
00:55:37,909 --> 00:55:39,309
How old are you?

732
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:40,739
I'm 10 years old.

733
00:55:40,739 --> 00:55:43,449
Your eyes are sparkling.

734
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:45,909
You will amount to something
when you grow up.

735
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,750
Sang Pil, you must be flattered.

736
00:55:51,289 --> 00:55:52,449
This is my daughter.

737
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:55,960
She looks smart.

738
00:55:57,289 --> 00:55:58,289
She's pretty, isn't she?

739
00:56:05,369 --> 00:56:07,269
For our children,

740
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:10,539
I'll reveal the truth.

741
00:56:13,739 --> 00:56:14,739
Okay.

742
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:17,079
Now that you say it,

743
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:18,949
it feels like...

744
00:56:19,449 --> 00:56:21,179
I did the right thing.

745
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:31,429
What are you doing?

746
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:34,400
I was thinking about old times.

747
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:40,940
Do you think we met
when we were young?

748
00:56:41,269 --> 00:56:42,539
We lived near each other.

749
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:46,539
At a place like the stationery store
downstairs.

750
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:48,909
I'm not sure.

751
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:51,880
I went to the stationery store
a few times.

(Closed)

754
00:57:04,989 --> 00:57:06,360
What do you want to buy?

755
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:10,400
- Why?
- It's closed.

756
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:14,599
If it's something I have,
you can borrow it from me.

757
00:57:16,039 --> 00:57:17,210
No thanks.

758
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:26,849
No way.

759
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,650
Why not? We could've met.

762
00:57:47,269 --> 00:57:49,500
Why did you want to see us?

763
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:54,809
I wouldn't want to see you
for no reason.

764
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,880
I guess something good just came up.

appealed against
the court's decision.

No matter how hard she tries,

768
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:12,260
she will be sentenced
to life in prison.

769
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:14,230
Everyone would think that way.

770

Even Cha Moon Sook's attorneys.

771
00:58:18,869 --> 00:58:21,539
You said you weren't
interested in promotions.

772
00:58:21,769 --> 00:58:23,610
But you've got promoted so quickly.

773
00:58:23,909 --> 00:58:26,710
The Special Unit of
Seoul Central Prosecutor's Office?

774
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:30,909
Gosh, that's not a place
to go for a promotion.

775
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:35,019
It's just that the country wants me
to fight fiercely to survive.

Bong Sang Pil.

777
00:58:40,659 --> 00:58:42,090
Let's go back to Seoul.

778
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:44,860
Seoul? Why?

779
00:58:45,329 --> 00:58:46,389
And you, Attorney Ha.

780
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:48,800
I want you guys...

I should go if Attorney Ha is going.

784

Hey, Cha Moon Sook.

785
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:13,190
Aren't you going to greet me?

786
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:15,659
I'm your senior in here.

787
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:19,730
Hey, you're still like that?

788
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:23,769
- Make sure to keep your ears open.
- Shut your mouth!

out for 12 months.

- It's 12 months.

- Please read this.
- 12 months.

Cha Moon Sook ordered the murder.

798
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:57,969
It's nothing worth speaking of.

you're innocent,

- It feels amazing.
- It's refreshing, right?

827
01:01:01,559 --> 01:01:02,900
Come have a seat.

828
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:04,099
Okay.

829
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:07,500
I'd like to make a toast.

830
01:01:07,969 --> 01:01:09,300
Who are we?

831
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:10,739
The villain of Kiseong,

832
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,440
Cha Moon Sook.

833
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,110
- Good.
- And An Oh Ju.

834
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:20,079
We're Lawless Law Firm
who dealt with them.

835
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:24,320
Now we should expand our business
across the city of Kiseong.

836
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:25,519
Hey, Geum Kang!

837
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:26,590
You startled me.

838
01:01:26,590 --> 01:01:29,590
The 12-month installment plan.
It was a great idea.

839
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:31,260
Gosh, you startled me.

840
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:33,190
All right. Cheers!

841
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:35,059
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

842
01:01:35,059 --> 01:01:37,099
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

843
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:40,500
Have some.

844
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,070
By the way,

845
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:45,369
Attorney Bong and Attorney Ha.

846
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:47,409
Are you really going to Seoul?

847
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,309
Yes, it was a last minute decision.

848
01:01:50,309 --> 01:01:51,650
Something important just came up.

849
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:54,619
I won't forget you guys
even if I go back to Seoul.

850
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:56,250
Kiseong is my hometown after all.

851
01:01:56,579 --> 01:01:59,019
We'll come by often,
so don't be upset.

852
01:01:59,019 --> 01:02:00,050
No...

853
01:02:01,219 --> 01:02:04,559
Lawless Law Firm
will always push forward.

854
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:09,199
Kwang Soo will start studying
to get into law school.

855
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:12,900
The path my boss took
is the path I'll take too.

856
01:02:14,469 --> 01:02:16,800
Boss, I love you.

857
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:17,969
Lawless!

858
01:02:18,070 --> 01:02:19,070
Lawless.

859
01:02:20,409 --> 01:02:22,780
You have one heck
of a loyal brother.

860
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:24,250
Is this for real?

861
01:02:24,409 --> 01:02:25,550
Are you sure?

862
01:02:25,550 --> 01:02:26,780
Really?

863
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:28,349
That's so cool of you!

864
01:02:28,519 --> 01:02:30,449
My dream guy is a lawyer.

865
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:34,190
Should I start calling you
Attorney Tae then?

866
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:35,519
Hold on a second.

867
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:38,889
If Mr. Tae becomes
my brother-in-law,

868
01:02:39,159 --> 01:02:42,300
does that mean
I'll be higher than him in rank?

869
01:02:42,329 --> 01:02:43,329
Geum Kang.

870
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:45,570
Hey!

871
01:02:46,469 --> 01:02:47,500
I'm at your service.

872
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,469
All right. Do eat.

873
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:52,409
Kang, am I getting married?

874
01:02:54,139 --> 01:02:55,510
You two make a great couple.

875
01:02:56,610 --> 01:02:59,110
Let's dig in.

876
01:03:06,050 --> 01:03:08,789
Stop at a rest area.
I'll take the wheel.

877
01:03:08,789 --> 01:03:11,829
I can't let you drive the entire
length of this bumpy road.

878
01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:15,630
I see I'm always at
the top of your mind.

879
01:03:15,630 --> 01:03:16,630
Of course.

880
01:03:17,329 --> 01:03:20,030
I've been watching you
for years, haven't I?

881
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,269
This is nothing.

882
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,340
How does it feel to leave Kiseong...

883
01:03:25,409 --> 01:03:27,809
with the woman
who made you come here?

884
01:03:28,739 --> 01:03:30,880
I feel like
I've achieved everything.

885
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:33,849
Revenge, justice,

886
01:03:34,550 --> 01:03:35,579
and love.

887
01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:38,219
You lucky man.

888
01:03:38,219 --> 01:03:41,659
Of course.
I'm the luckiest man alive!

889
01:03:44,659 --> 01:03:46,530
Wait, hold on. Slow down.

890
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:48,460
Sang Pil, don't be scared...

891
01:03:48,699 --> 01:03:50,599
for there will be more hardships.

892
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:54,539
Isn't that what I said to you?

893
01:03:54,639 --> 01:03:56,969
All right then. Let's get going.

894
01:03:57,769 --> 01:03:59,039
Let's go.

895
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:01,679
- Push forward.
- Straight ahead.

896
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:15,190
(Supreme Prosecutors' Office
Republic of Korea)

897
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:28,400
Hello, sir.

898
01:04:28,469 --> 01:04:29,940
Bong Sang Pil, Ha Jae I,

899
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:32,510
welcome to Seoul,
the land of the lawless.

900
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:33,940
"The land of the lawless"?

901
01:04:36,309 --> 01:04:39,050
I'm only targeting
the corruption committed by...

902
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:40,579
high government officials.

903
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:43,280
I see there's a lot to eat
at this buffet.

904
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:46,420
We should arrest all hypocrites
who deceive people...

905
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:48,389
by abusing their power...

906
01:04:48,659 --> 01:04:49,719
and have them stand in court.

907
01:04:49,889 --> 01:04:52,489
This is a city that
needs a lawless lawyer too.

908
01:04:52,630 --> 01:04:55,530
Then let's get started,
the lawless way.

909
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:57,769
- Let's fight!
- With the law!
