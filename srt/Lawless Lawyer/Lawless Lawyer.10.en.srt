(Lawless Lawyer)

7
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,569
Yes, Detective Gong.

8
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,840
Jae I.

9
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:11,510
Attorney Bong is
being transferred to a hospital now.

10
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,750
What do you mean?

11
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:22,790
Bong Sang Pil.

12
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:24,959
Please...

13
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:48,849
Sang Pil, Sang Pil!

14
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,349
Sang Pil.

15
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,650
Sang Pil...

16
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,390
Sang Pil.

17
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,430
Please wait outside.

18
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,770
(Operating Room)

19
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,479
Attorney Ha, what happened?

20
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,710
What's going to happen
to Attorney Bong now?

21
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,889
- Gosh...
- My goodness, Attorney Ha.

22
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,319
It's okay.

23
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:33,020
You all know how strong he is.

24
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,759
He'll be okay.

25
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:36,759
He'll be fine.

26
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:49,539
You pushed my father out
in the blink of an eye.

27
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,180
And now you need me?

28
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:56,180
All Kiseong citizens are well aware
of Judge Cha Byung Ho's achievement.

29
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,180
And now, we need his esteemed
daughter, Judge Cha Moon Sook,

30
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,150
to follow in her father's footsteps
and serve the people.

31
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,889
It will be the chance of a lifetime
to redound to your father's honor.

32
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,300
I was able to grow Ohju Group
to what it is now...

33
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,099
because of my frugality.

34
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:23,139
And... What's the word?

35
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,240
Right, being hungry for success.

36
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,710
In my opinion, those two
were the biggest contributors.

37
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,050
And I'd never spend or even touch
money that is not mine.

38
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:37,360
A public official
should never do such a thing.

39
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,990
My gosh. I must say, the people
of Kiseong chose the perfect mayor.

40
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,060
- I'm truly impressed.
- Are we done now?

41
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,430
Yes, thank you.

42
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:48,569
Great! Thank you.

43
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:50,969
- Thank you.
- Great work.

44
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:51,969
Gwan Dong.

45
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,240
- Gosh, because of this...
- Goodness, no.

46
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,539
- Please! Don't.
- Please accept it.

47
00:03:57,539 --> 00:03:58,639
My goodness.

48
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,180
It's from the city's
expense account,

49
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,680
so you have nothing to worry about.
Just put it in your pocket.

50
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,319
And you see...

51
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,620
Judge Cha doesn't call meetings
with The Seven as often these days.

52
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:15,860
She seems a bit different.

53
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,560
Don't you think
she's changed a little?

54
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,129
I've been feeling that too,

55
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,329
but I don't really want to ask.

56
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,500
Mr. Mayor, there's something
I have to report to you.

57
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,379
Judge Cha.

58
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,550
- What is it?
- Bong Sang Pil was stabbed.

59
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,279
He's unconscious now.

60
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,620
Really?

61
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,420
Okay.

62
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,730
Bong Sang Pil
got stabbed in the stomach?

63
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,430
Did you plan it?

64
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,170
I'm sorry, sir.
I didn't think to do that, sir.

65
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:07,680
I know very well
that you're not that clever.

66
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,720
I'd never do anything
without your permission, sir.

67
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:17,160
I'm thinking
there must've been someone...

68
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,360
in prison
who wanted to kill Bong Sang Pil.

69
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:23,959
I mean, if he dies
in the hospital...

70
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:27,329
before the verdict is announced,
the investigation will stop as well.

71
00:05:27,529 --> 00:05:30,269
Wouldn't it be perfect for us?

72
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,569
Aren't you happy, sir?

73
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,449
So that means,

74
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,720
besides me, there is someone else
after Bong Sang Pil as well.

75
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:51,920
In other words,

76
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,959
Cha Moon Sook...

77
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,399
must've hired another hitman
on top of me.

78
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:01,769
Aren't I right?

79
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,439
Don't worry too much.

80
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:24,490
Did the surgery go well?

81
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,360
Yes, he passed the critical stage.

82
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,490
He'll regain his consciousness soon.

83
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,699
See? I told you he'd be fine.

84
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:32,129
Thank you, Doctor.

85
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:34,129
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

86
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,100
- He won't die!
- Keep it down.

87
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:45,939
You cannot go in.

88
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,680
Let her in. She's his attorney.

89
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,220
I got my visiting permit via fax.

90
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,720
Let's go in.

91
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,290
Only Attorney Ha is allowed in.

92
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,759
Are there too many of us?

93
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,360
- Why did you guys follow us?
- I want to see him.

94
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:16,339
If she...

95
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,110
ends up with even a small cut,

96
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,110
I'll kill you.

97
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,480
Don't worry about anything.

98
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,519
I'll protect you no matter what.

99
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,790
I don't need anyone to protect me.

100
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,920
Just in case something happens.

101
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:40,230
- Bong Sang Pil.
- I'll run to wherever you are.

102
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:41,970
Okay?

103
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:46,439
Why didn't I know back then?

104
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:49,839
You tried so hard...

105
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,980
to keep me safe.

106
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:55,250
You mean...

107
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,720
so much to me.

108
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,459
I promise I'll be
really good to you from now on.

109
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:09,060
I'm going to do everything
I haven't been...

110
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,360
able to do for you so far,

111
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:13,970
Sang Pil.

112
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,050
You really mean it, right?

113
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:37,120
Sang Pil.

114
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:41,559
Answer me first.

115
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,600
Did you really mean
what you just said?

116
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,370
It's me, Bong Sang Pil.

117
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,539
Sang Pil.

118
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,779
Thank you for coming back to me.

119
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,750
Do you know how scared I was?

120
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:05,149
If you scare me like that
once again, I'll...

121
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,120
Sang Pil.

122
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:17,230
I want to punch you, but I can't.

123
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,350
Thank goodness Sang Pil
regained his consciousness.

124
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,980
He'll have to be hospitalized
for the time being, right?

125
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:40,250
Yes. I applied for bail
so that he doesn't have to...

126
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,090
return to the detention center
right away.

127
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,250
Okay.

128
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:02,240
Mr. Tae, look into
the insurance payout.

129
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:05,039
I need to find out
what's really going on.

130
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,080
Got it.

131
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,250
And what's going on with tracking
Seok Gwan Dong's burner phone?

132
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,250
That's...

133
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:17,250
It's probably not doable, right?

134
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,029
It's nothing hard.

135
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,830
I'll make it happen!

136
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,200
- Great.
- That's the spirit!

137
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:29,169
Geum Kang and Geum Ja,
try to track down the witness.

138
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:32,039
He may have fled already,
but we should still try.

139
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:35,470
Of course. We'll go to the end
of the world if we have to.

140
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,580
Hey, you and I are
in agreement for a change.

141
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,009
- Great!
- Great!

142
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:42,379
Go, team!

143
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,049
Geum Kang,
what kind of law firm is this?

144
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,389
You idiot!

145
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:50,389
- We're...
- We're fighters.

146
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:52,820
We fight for our clients.

147
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:57,500
- Lawless
- Lawless

148
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,929
- Lawyers!
- Lawyers!

149
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,740
We're the only ones...

150
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,840
that can help Attorney Bong,

151
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:08,669
so let's work together.

152
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:09,909
- Yes!
- Let's go!

153
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:19,519
Judge Cha wants my attorney
to get me acquitted,

154
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:22,190
but you're trying to kill me.

155
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:26,620
It doesn't look like you two
see eye to eye.

156
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:29,460
What's wrong? You didn't know?

157
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:32,600
She wants me to win this trial.

158
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:40,539
This guy is Dae Woong Gang's
number two, Kwon Man Bae.

159
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:45,080
He and Bong Sang Pil almost got into
a fight at Choi Dae Woong's funeral.

160
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:48,250
It looks like he got one of his
underlings in the prison to do it.

161
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,649
Those idiots.

162
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,820
They think
Bong Sang Pil killed their boss.

163
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,149
Because Choi Dae Woong died,

164
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,419
this guy is Dae Woong Gang's
number one now.

165
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,860
Do you actually think he was the one
who whacked Bong Sang Pil?

166
00:12:06,129 --> 00:12:07,259
Do you think it makes sense?

167
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:10,169
He should be thanking Bong Sang Pil.

168
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,340
Well, if he thought
that Bong Sang Pil killed his boss,

169
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,809
he'd still try to get his revenge.

170
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,779
What did you just say?

171
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:19,610
"Revenge"?

172
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:23,149
Then will you avenge for me...

173
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:25,519
if I get stabbed and die?

174
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,990
Of course, Mr. Mayor.

175
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:34,190
The three seconds you hesitated...

176
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,259
showed me how you really feel.

177
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,500
How dare you try to fool me?

178
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,830
Thugs never seek revenge.

179
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,740
Thugs these days
aren't even real thugs.

180
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:48,210
Notions such as revenge and loyalty
are long gone.

181
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:49,570
You idiot.

182
00:12:50,539 --> 00:12:52,779
Then let's say...

183
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:55,580
someone whacks Judge Cha Moon Sook.

184
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,919
Will you do nothing about it?

185
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:00,450
You punk. I think I've been...

186
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,889
way too nice to you these days.

187
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:05,059
No, don't get me wrong, sir.
I'm sorry.

188
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:11,700
Taking revenge against someone
for Judge Cha...

189
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:16,500
Well, I must say
that it is an interesting question.

190
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:25,309
As for that punk, Bong Sang Pil,

191
00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:28,309
I'm working on taking care of him.

192
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:32,679
What are you up to these days?

193
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:33,879
You don't report to me anymore.

194
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:36,049
Because of that jerk,

195
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,289
the company handover process...

196
00:13:38,289 --> 00:13:40,929
is stalling.

197
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,789
I may not always repay kindness,

198
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,529
but I always repay those
who are a nuisance.

199
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:46,929
A nuisance?

200
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,970
With Ohju Group, I thought
everything had been taken care of.

201
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,940
Things have been sorted out,

202
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,080
but we still have
loose ends to tie up.

203
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,580
Are you mistakenly thinking...

204
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:08,519
that Kiseong is yours
now that you're the mayor?

205
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,620
Goodness.

206
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:18,129
Don't I have enough authority now...

207
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,370
to take care of things like this
at my own discretion?

208
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,669
Judge Cha.

209
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,659
This is the only way...

210
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,330
to prove my innocence.

211
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,169
Look at this.

212
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:58,940
It's quite nice.

213
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,169
How's the wound?

214
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,950
It was enough to hospitalize you,

215
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:09,980
but you're still alive.

216
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,250
You scum!

217
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:23,990
Stop it and let go. Let go.

218
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,299
Let go!

219
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,169
You talk big about...

220
00:15:30,669 --> 00:15:32,600
either killing me or not,

221
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,409
so it'll be a shame
to see you die first.

222
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,710
Take better care of yourself.

223
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,309
Just so you know,

224
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,250
I had nothing to do...

225
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:46,019
with this incident.

226
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:49,090
Stop beating around the bush,

227
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,019
and say what you want
and get lost.

228
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:55,389
I came to see you
out of the goodness of my heart.

229
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:57,830
Would it kill you to be more polite?

230
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,200
You never know.

231
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,600
I might be the one to help you
find the person who stabbed you.

232
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,539
Just look at you, Bong Sang Pil.

233
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:13,679
Wherever you go,

234
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,350
no matter what air you breathe,

235
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,549
you're surrounded by enemies.

236
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,019
Live a more exemplary life,
why don't you?

237
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,620
Like me.

238
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,799
Judging by the look
on Bong Sang Pil's face,

239
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:38,539
he seems to be clueless
of what happened.

240
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,370
My goodness.

241
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,639
If it isn't
Prosecutor Cheon Seung Beom.

242
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:47,580
How's the case
against Bong Sang Pil going?

243
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:49,450
You should head in first.

244
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:51,149
Yes, sir.

245
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,620
I can't believe
I'm on the mayor's radar.

246
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,120
It must mean I'm doing my job right.

247
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:02,190
Well, thanks to you,

248
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,500
the succession of my funds
came to a halt.

249
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,700
Even though
I forget everything else,

250
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,839
I will never forget your name,

251
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,900
Prosecutor Cheon Seung Beom.

252
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,210
Is that so?

253
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,640
What business did you have
with Bong Sang Pil?

254
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:24,150
My goodness.
Nothing gets by you, does it?

255
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:26,680
I doubt it was a friendly visit.

256
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,589
You seem very interested
in his case.

257
00:17:30,589 --> 00:17:33,089
It's not that
I'm personally interested.

258
00:17:33,089 --> 00:17:35,730
As the mayor of this city...

259
00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:39,759
What he did is unacceptable
in the eyes of humanity.

260
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:42,599
- He killed his own flesh and blood!
- That's right, sir. Please

261
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:46,769
make sure that
he gets the sentence he deserves.

262
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,910
What I mean is that...

263
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:54,680
I don't want him ever roaming
the streets of Kiseong again.

264
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:57,680
Sure thing.

265
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,849
I do hope that...

266
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:03,349
you never sit across from me
in court too.

267
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:07,619
Of course.

268
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,660
Good day!

269
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,569
Bong Sang Pil.

270
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,250
Lift your head up.

271
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:32,549
We spotted him on
the prison's closed-circuit TV.

272
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,089
Is he the one who stabbed you?

273
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:36,390
No, it's not.

274
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:38,789
You're wrong.

275
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,660
What?

276
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:43,789
My attacker was
shorter and skinnier.

277
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:50,329
Is that so?

278
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:53,940
We have no choice
but to believe the victim.

279
00:18:54,609 --> 00:18:56,140
Get a closer look at him.

280
00:18:56,539 --> 00:18:59,180
- This is the guy.
- I'm certain it's not.

281
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:04,549
Detective Gong,
please leave with the suspect.

282
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,650
Yes, sir.

283
00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:07,849
Go.

284
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,130
Do you believe...

285
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,900
that I killed my uncle too?

286
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,339
I don't believe in the living.

287
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,039
I only trust
the deceased and the evidence,

288
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,039
and the evidence says...

289
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,240
that you're the killer.

290
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:39,680
One thing is bugging me though.

291
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:44,390
Why did...

292
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,089
Mayor An come to visit you?

293
00:19:48,859 --> 00:19:49,859
I'm curious.

294
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:53,299
He wanted to know who stabbed me...

295
00:19:53,829 --> 00:19:55,069
and came here to ask in person.

296
00:19:57,569 --> 00:20:00,170
You should be greatly
prepared for my trial.

297
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,410
You see,

298
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:05,410
my lawyer is far more persistent.

299
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:09,079
You know very well...

300
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:12,180
that I get excited when
I go up against someone like me.

301
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,619
I'll see you in court.

302
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,000
Doesn't Bong Sang Pil scare you?

303
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,599
He's a known thug and a murderer.

304
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:34,240
The trial isn't over yet.

305
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,210
I can already see the verdict,

306
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,710
so what's the point?

307
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,079
An attorney who judges its own
client before the trial is over.

308
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,049
A prosecutor who thinks she won
based on what she can only see.

309
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,549
Who is more problematic?

310
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,619
- What?
- Someone asked me that once.

311
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,329
Now I know how it feels to ask that.

312
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,730
You've never once trusted
anyone fully who isn't you.

313
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,230
I also bet that...

314
00:21:02,569 --> 00:21:06,339
you've never wanted to risk your
whole life to save that someone.

315
00:21:07,869 --> 00:21:10,710
An attorney shouldn't get
emotional over a trial.

316
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,910
To a suspect who's
100 percent innocent,

317
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:17,480
the trust of his lawyer
means the most.

318
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,319
You should know that.

319
00:21:26,259 --> 00:21:27,259
Jae I?

320
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:36,130
I'm glad to hear that
Bong Sang Pil is doing much better.

321
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,640
Do you really mean that?

322
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:43,109
You really think I'd want
Attorney Bong to die in prison?

323
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,910
I feel like you mean
the exact opposite.

324
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,450
My gosh, Jae I.

325
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:50,910
You've changed a lot.

326
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:55,519
Don't think that you're past will be
erased if you get rid of Sang Pil.

327
00:21:55,819 --> 00:21:58,359
My past? What do you mean?

328
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,200
What do you know?

329
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,869
Don't assure yourself the past
has been completely erased...

330
00:22:09,269 --> 00:22:12,400
for the past is what
shapes the future.

331
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,109
That's interesting.

332
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,779
I'll look forward to
seeing you actually...

333
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,019
prove that.

334
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,759
We will now begin
Bong Sang Pil's bond hearing.

335
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,059
Defense attorney, make your case.

336
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,130
Two days ago,
the defendant, Bong Sang Pil,

337
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:46,670
was stabbed in the prison
he was confined to.

338
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,670
His killer is still
among the inmates,

339
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,539
so by sending him back,

340
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:55,380
you'll be exposing him
to the same threat...

341
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,849
which is why I ask
he be released on bail.

342
00:22:58,819 --> 00:23:00,720
Prosecution, make your case.

343
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,390
We still don't know...

344
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:04,920
whether his life
was really threatened...

345
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,759
or he injured himself
purposely in order...

346
00:23:07,859 --> 00:23:09,630
to be released on bail.

347
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,759
Are you implying that
he stabbed himself?

348
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:14,660
Or he may have asked someone
to stab him...

349
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:16,369
but miss vital organs.

350
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:19,240
Prosecutor Kang,
watch what you're saying.

351
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:23,869
At a hearing presided
by you, Judge Cha,

352
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:26,009
he insulted this court...

353
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:28,609
and purposely had himself
be held in contempt.

354
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:31,819
It's not a far-stretched theory.

355
00:23:31,819 --> 00:23:35,750
Prosecutor Cheon, what is
your opinion on the matter?

356
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:38,220
The defendant...

357
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:42,690
is strongly denying all charges
brought up against him in court.

358
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,960
If he's out on bail,

359
00:23:44,329 --> 00:23:48,299
he might find the opportunity
to destroy evidence.

360
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:50,299
Then I'll make my decision.

361
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:53,140
I agree with
the logical assumption...

362
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:56,740
made by Prosecutor Cheon
regarding...

363
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:00,539
Bong Sang Pil's opportunity
to destroy evidence.

364
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:04,180
Therefore, I dismiss
the application for bail...

365
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:05,819
presented by his attorney.

366
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:16,359
Hi.

367
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:25,569
The application for bail was denied.

368
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,400
Yes.

369
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,470
Of course.

370
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:32,079
Judge Cha would never allow it.

371
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,450
You did great though,

372
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:37,750
Attorney Ha.

373
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,119
How are you feeling?

374
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:42,890
I'm not sure.

375
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,990
I've never had anyone
visit me this often at a hospital,

376
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:48,430
so I'm not used to this.

377
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,700
You're obviously fine now.

378
00:24:52,829 --> 00:24:54,700
No, I haven't fully recovered yet.

379
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:56,930
Gosh, the carp here are
as big as sharks.

380
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:00,000
And pigeons these days
are the size of hens.

381
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:02,670
- I'm tiny, but they're gigantic.
- Boss!

382
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:03,740
- What?
- Boss.

383
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,910
Hey, the Lawless Law Firm family!

384
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,680
- My gosh!
- Boss.

385
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,549
- What's wrong?
- Are you okay?

386
00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:16,619
That scared you, didn't it?

387
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,089
- Gosh!
- Gosh, seriously.

388
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:21,589
Boss, thank you so much...

389
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,690
for showing up alive like this.

390
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:28,000
I've been feeling horrible, thinking
that you ended up like that...

391
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,529
because of all the bad deeds
I've done.

392
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,099
I'm sorry, Boss.

393
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:35,670
We all missed you very much,
Attorney Bong.

394
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,710
I'm sorry I worried you guys.

395
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:39,910
- Don't say that!
- Don't worry about it.

396
00:25:40,109 --> 00:25:42,680
We should have drinks
to celebrate our reunion.

397
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,609
- Great idea!
- Let's grab a drink.

398
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:47,019
You dimwit. How can a patient drink?

399
00:25:47,019 --> 00:25:48,180
When else would you have a drink?

400
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:51,119
Give us some privacy, will you?
We'd like to spend some alone time.

401
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,819
- Oh, right!
- My gosh, yes!

402
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:54,819
- You guys just can't take a hint.
- No problem, Boss.

403
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:56,329
- Have a good time.
- See you later.

404
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,230
Thanks, guys.

405
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:01,400
My gosh, this feels so nice.

406
00:26:02,369 --> 00:26:04,269
I wish we could walk together.

407
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,500
I'm sorry I'm making you
push me in a wheelchair.

408
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,880
You must be realizing
how much you really need me.

409
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:13,880
Yes, I am.

410
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:17,109
Mister.

411
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:20,619
Aren't you ill? Why are there
handcuffs on your wrists?

412
00:26:20,849 --> 00:26:23,720
Oh, that's...

413
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,119
- He's just...
- It's because...

414
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,359
one of my teammates...

415
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:30,130
punched me by mistake.

416
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,200
Don't talk to people like that.

417
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,599
You never told me
even though I kept asking you.

418
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:42,710
So you were a member
of Dae Woong Gang?

419
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,849
I have the right
to know more about you,

420
00:26:50,779 --> 00:26:51,920
because I'm your attorney.

421
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,920
Is that all?

422
00:26:56,619 --> 00:26:57,720
And...

423
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,359
because you're my man.

424
00:27:10,069 --> 00:27:11,970
Thanks, Jae I.

425
00:27:15,569 --> 00:27:17,769
You're such a great acupressurist.

426
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:20,009
Pardon me? Oh, thank you.

427
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:23,549
- Do you have any family?
- No, ma'am.

428
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:26,680
You seem to have been through a lot.

429
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:30,589
It looks like Judge Cha really likes
your acupressure massages.

430
00:27:30,589 --> 00:27:32,759
She rarely asks
her therapists such questions.

431
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:39,059
Judge Cha, I asked Mr. Ha to come
for tomorrow's photo shoot.

432
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:40,130
All right.

433
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:43,130
By the way,
what has Mayor An been up to...

434
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,240
in the last few days?

435
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,839
I haven't heard a word from him...

436
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:48,670
since he stormed out that day.

437
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:52,279
He seems to think that he's become
a person of influence.

438
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,809
Like I told you before, no one is...

439
00:27:55,809 --> 00:27:58,849
as loyal to you as I am.

440
00:27:59,819 --> 00:28:02,289
- Don't let him into my house.
- Pardon?

441
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,519
Got it, ma'am.
I'll pass the message along.

442
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:08,960
Judge Cha.

443
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,430
I'm here.

444
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,440
What are you doing here?
I never asked you to come. Get out.

445
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,369
You're not allowed in here
for the next little while.

446
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,369
It's Judge Cha's order.

447
00:28:23,609 --> 00:28:25,009
Hear me out first.

448
00:28:26,339 --> 00:28:29,579
I figured there might be
a misunderstanding...

449
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:31,380
in regard to what happened
to Bong Sang Pil.

450
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,420
I've been worried, so I came
to speak to you in person.

451
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,490
Why are you still here?
Get out this instant.

452
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,619
- Yes, ma'am.
- You should leave the room as well.

453
00:28:38,859 --> 00:28:39,920
Me too?

454
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:50,430
Wait, just a second.

455
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,710
Good job today.

456
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:58,480
Thank you...

457
00:29:07,819 --> 00:29:09,119
Why aren't you picking them up?

458
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:14,789
Thank you, ma'am.

459
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,599
Are you thanking me
for only one bill?

460
00:29:22,329 --> 00:29:25,099
Thank you, ma'am. Thank you, ma'am.

461
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:28,039
Thank you, ma'am. Thank you, ma'am.

462
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:30,240
Thank you, ma'am.

463
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:33,579
Listen carefully.

464
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,410
If you leak...

465
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:38,279
anything you saw or heard here,

466
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,019
not only you,

467
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:42,789
but your family will also be hurt.

468
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,690
Oh, right.
Did you say you have no family?

469
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:49,690
Yes, ma'am.

470
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:52,200
Then I'm going to track down
everyone you know,

471
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,099
including your friends
and relatives,

472
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,670
and hurt them all.

473
00:29:57,869 --> 00:30:01,299
Do you understand?

474
00:30:01,769 --> 00:30:04,539
Yes, ma'am. I'll never forget that.

475
00:30:06,109 --> 00:30:08,180
Goodness, why is this in my way?

476
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,559
There's something
I want to show you.

477
00:30:41,609 --> 00:30:44,309
Who gave you this?

478
00:30:44,579 --> 00:30:46,119
A woman.

479
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:48,349
I think she knows your uncle.

480
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,319
- My uncle?
- Yes.

481
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:53,190
She told me he helped her
get into Judge Cha's house...

482
00:30:53,589 --> 00:30:54,960
as her acupressurist.

483
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:58,660
And he gave her these photos.

484
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:05,000
Bong Sang Pil.

485
00:31:06,569 --> 00:31:08,569
So it wasn't your doing?

486
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:11,309
Gosh, it definitely wasn't me.

487
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:13,910
I figured you'd...

488
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:17,549
suspect that I did it.

489
00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:21,420
I'll find out who did it...

490
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:23,519
and report to you right away.

491
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:24,750
You see,

492
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:28,259
reporting after doing the deed
is a way of showing me...

493
00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:29,390
that you defy my authority.

494
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,299
Whoever did it
dared to touch your prey...

495
00:31:37,299 --> 00:31:38,500
without your permission.

496
00:31:39,099 --> 00:31:40,470
I'll find out who did it...

497
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:44,210
and bring that jerk to you.

498
00:31:44,509 --> 00:31:45,880
Please...

499
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,009
forgive me after that.

500
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:53,750
An Oh Ju, you're incredibly sneaky.

501
00:31:54,819 --> 00:31:56,150
You came here...

502
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:59,019
to check on me because you were
worried you might get in trouble.

503
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,920
But you're acting like you're
begging for my forgiveness.

504
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,400
Well, I'll get going, then.

505
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:09,569
Goodbye, Judge Cha.

506
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,339
I'm home.

507
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,119
She hasn't picked up her photos yet.

508
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:53,309
I...

509
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:56,180
work as an acupressurist
at Judge Cha Moon Sook's...

510
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,009
private residence.

511
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,380
Pardon?

512
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:05,890
I'm fighting against Cha Moon Sook.

513
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,259
Just like you are now.

514
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:34,079
(Ha's Photo Studio)

515
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,869
Hey, how could you still be in bed?

516
00:33:55,269 --> 00:33:56,710
Oh, my.

517
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,839
Are you going somewhere nice?

518
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,039
You only wear that tie
on special occasions.

519
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,509
Mom got it for you
for your birthday.

520
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,549
I have to take photos
of Judge Cha...

521
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:09,289
for the cover of her autobiography.

522
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:13,860
Dad.

523
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,429
Is that why you're wearing that tie?

524
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,429
Jae I.

525
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,730
I'm not sure why you have
misunderstandings about her,

526
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:28,570
but I'd like you
to respect what I do.

527
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,539
See you later.

528
00:34:33,309 --> 00:34:34,380
Make sure you eat something.

529
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:44,889
Hold on a moment.

530
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,519
We're ready.

531
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:54,199
Judge Cha.

532
00:34:54,929 --> 00:35:00,139
Could we move that porcelain jar
elsewhere for a few minutes?

533
00:35:00,739 --> 00:35:01,969
Why?

534
00:35:01,969 --> 00:35:04,670
It suits Judge Cha,
and it looks great there.

535
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:07,510
We should listen to
the photographer. Sure, go ahead.

536
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:09,110
Yes, ma'am. I'll move it, then.

537
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:12,079
Ms. Nam, you should stay out
of the frame too.

538
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:21,190
My gosh!

539
00:35:21,889 --> 00:35:22,929
Oh, no.

540
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:27,059
Gosh, I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry, ma'am.

541
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:29,599
Goodness gracious! Do you know
how much this is worth?

542
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,170
I told you to just leave it there!

543
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:35,769
I'll compensate you for this.
I definitely will, ma'am.

544
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:37,309
You'll pay for this?

545
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:40,079
Do you even know
how much this is valued at?

546
00:35:40,809 --> 00:35:42,880
- This goes for 100,000 dollars.
- Pardon?

547
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:47,250
- 100,000 dollars?
- Gosh, don't make such a fuss.

548
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:50,519
Please clean up,
and we'll continue the shoot.

549
00:35:51,019 --> 00:35:53,389
Okay. I'll clean this up, ma'am.

550
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,429
My goodness. Judge Cha, you're
incredibly understanding and kind.

551
00:35:57,659 --> 00:36:00,030
I'd kick him out immediately
if this happened to me.

552
00:36:02,469 --> 00:36:04,570
Goodness, you're such a handful.

553
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,170
Why are you standing there?

554
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:08,739
Come in and help him clean this up.

555
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,670
Didn't you hear me?

556
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,380
Good grief.

557
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:32,429
Gosh, it's okay.

558
00:36:32,659 --> 00:36:34,199
You can take care of this ourselves.

559
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:35,730
You don't need to help.
Here, take this.

560
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:36,929
Mr. Ha.

561
00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:41,199
I guess you've given up
on finding Jae I's mother.

562
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,340
It's been a long time...

563
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:47,280
since I started just believing
that she'd be alive somewhere.

564
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:49,650
Jae I must take after her mother.

565
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,449
She's very stubborn.

566
00:36:53,449 --> 00:36:55,719
I'm sorry.
I sincerely apologize on her behalf.

567
00:36:55,719 --> 00:36:58,789
Hurry up already.
Judge Cha is waiting.

568
00:36:58,789 --> 00:36:59,989
Yes, we're almost done.

569
00:37:00,019 --> 00:37:01,019
Let's hurry.

570
00:37:13,969 --> 00:37:16,739
About that acupressurist...
Can we really trust her?

571
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:21,940
I mean, you know nothing about her.

572
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,179
That's true.

573
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:26,280
Jae I.

574
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:29,719
Like what happened with my uncle,

575
00:37:30,019 --> 00:37:32,019
An Oh Ju might try
to turn the tables.

576
00:37:33,219 --> 00:37:34,659
The trial is important, of course.

577
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,030
But you matter more to me.

578
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,360
I know what you're worried about.

579
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,699
I'm not really sure
how to explain this,

580
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:47,570
but I don't think
that lady would fool me.

581
00:37:48,269 --> 00:37:50,139
Not just because
she gave me photos of Cha Moon Sook.

582
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,309
For some reason,

583
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:55,710
I think she's telling the truth...

584
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:57,679
about every single thing.

585
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,420
Kwang Soo!

586
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:08,019
Attorney Ha, I'm here.

587
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,429
Of course.

588
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:15,360
I'm the person who had
her ID photos taken.

589
00:38:15,699 --> 00:38:19,199
I'll come to Lawless Law Firm
at 11pm tonight.

590
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,869
I hope we can talk alone.

591
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:29,179
Sure, that's no problem at all.
I'll be waiting.

592
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,900
You made it. I was waiting for you.

593
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,400
Is this your desk?

594
00:38:54,869 --> 00:38:56,010
Yes.

595
00:38:59,909 --> 00:39:01,179
And here are your photos.

596
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,050
Thank you.

597
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,079
- Would you like some tea?
- Sure.

598
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:16,760
Ha Jae I.

599
00:39:23,269 --> 00:39:25,199
First, I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

600
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:33,480
Did Mr. Choi Dae Woong really
give you those photos of Judge Cha?

601
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:37,650
I'd also like to you ask you
why you gave me those photos.

602
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:42,690
You must know how menacing
and dangerous Judge Cha is.

603
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,519
Why are you
doing these things voluntarily?

604
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:55,059
I'm sorry. I bombarded you
with too many questions, didn't I?

605
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:58,730
I actually...

606
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,340
found those photos
at Judge Cha's residence.

607
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,610
I said that I got them
from Mr. Choi because...

608
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:07,239
I was worried you wouldn't trust me.

609
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:12,780
And it is true that Mr. Choi
got me into her residence.

610
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:19,050
The reason I'm doing this,
fully knowing what Judge Cha...

611
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:20,659
is capable of doing...

612
00:40:26,699 --> 00:40:28,059
I'm doing this because...

613
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,300
I want my life back.

614
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:34,869
I'm ready to give up everything
I have...

615
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:38,469
if I can reclaim
the years that I've lost.

616
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:40,909
The years you've lost?

617
00:40:43,409 --> 00:40:46,480
I didn't come here
to talk about things like this.

618
00:40:50,019 --> 00:40:54,159
The relationship between Judge Cha
and Mayor An is turning sour.

619
00:40:55,389 --> 00:40:57,590
- Pardon me?
- It looks like...

620
00:40:57,889 --> 00:41:00,030
they will have a problem soon.

621
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,340
I should...

622
00:41:06,969 --> 00:41:08,239
get going now.

623
00:41:09,969 --> 00:41:11,210
If you don't mind,

624
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,610
could you tell me your name?

625
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,280
I just don't know
how to address you.

626
00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:23,349
Everyone at Judge Cha's residence...

627
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:28,219
calls me Mama.

628
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,030
I see.

629
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,659
Mama.

630
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:40,440
It sounds like there's a conflict
between An Oh Ju and Cha Moon Sook.

631
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:42,239
What do you mean?

632
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:44,809
The lady who works at Judge Cha's
residence gave me the information.

633
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:49,880
I know that lady wouldn't lie to me.

634
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:52,550
If you can't trust her,

635
00:41:53,179 --> 00:41:54,280
just trust me instead.

636
00:41:57,690 --> 00:42:00,659
So, a chasm is forming between the
crocodile and the crocodile bird.

637
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:17,039
The same goes for you.
Bark and bite...

638
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:20,139
only when I tell you to do so
because you're my dog.

639
00:42:24,309 --> 00:42:26,150
Where to, sir?

640
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:30,590
You stay here.

641
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,389
I'm going alone.

642
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:35,619
Pardon me?

643
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:37,829
Okay, sir.

644
00:43:07,219 --> 00:43:08,559
We just arrived
at the hospital, sir.

645
00:43:10,789 --> 00:43:11,860
Wait there.

646
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,070
- My gosh, Mr. Mayor.
- Yes, hello.

647
00:43:23,469 --> 00:43:25,070
Gosh, you must be tired.

648
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:27,440
I have to talk to him
about something,

649
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,650
so please wait outside.

650
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:31,010
Oh, well... Yes, sir.

651
00:43:47,429 --> 00:43:48,429
Do it.

652
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:23,369
Judge Cha...

653
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:26,269
Actually, no.

654
00:44:28,269 --> 00:44:31,110
Do you remember what you said to me?

655
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:34,010
You must have a lot on your mind...

656
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:36,010
to come and see me at this hour.

657
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:38,880
Did Judge Cha really
tell your attorney...

658
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:40,880
to clear your name?

659
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:44,349
Oh, that?

660
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:50,090
You should've asked her
instead of coming here to me.

661
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:52,429
You came to the wrong guy.

662
00:45:00,039 --> 00:45:01,269
Who the heck are you?

663
00:45:02,039 --> 00:45:04,239
Sir, Bong Sang Pil isn't alone.

664
00:45:05,139 --> 00:45:06,179
What do you mean?

665
00:45:06,179 --> 00:45:07,340
He has company.

666
00:45:07,809 --> 00:45:09,039
It's Mayor An.

667
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,849
What? Mayor An?

668
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:19,420
Judge Cha, what should we do?

669
00:45:36,769 --> 00:45:39,510
Are you sure about this?
I'm none other than An Oh Ju.

670
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:41,010
We know, Mayor An.

671
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,380
There's no one here that'll
show you the appropriate respect.

672
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:47,320
One's cuffed to the bed,

673
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:49,150
and one's an old man.

674
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:51,820
This isn't even a job
considering how easy it is.

675
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:52,889
What?

676
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:54,619
An old man?

677
00:45:56,690 --> 00:45:58,789
You, Bong Sang Pil,

678
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,929
it's every man for himself.

679
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,150
They're crawling everywhere.

680
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:29,789
I've been saving
the most delicious until last,

681
00:46:29,789 --> 00:46:32,260
so I can't have others
taking what's mine.

682
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,929
I'm only helping because
I can't have you die here.

683
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,639
Just you know that.

684
00:46:39,769 --> 00:46:40,769
Sure.

685
00:46:41,869 --> 00:46:43,840
Today doesn't seem like the day.

686
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,380
If you die...

687
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,250
until this is all sorted,
I'll kill you again myself.

688
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:02,460
That'll never happen until
I end your life, so don't worry.

689
00:47:23,949 --> 00:47:26,110
Seeing stars yet?

690
00:47:44,929 --> 00:47:47,469
Bong Sang Pil, let's go.

691
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:03,119
Just go.

692
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:08,289
Leave. Get lost.

693
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,530
Who has the power
to go to this length...

694
00:49:23,469 --> 00:49:24,630
to kill us both?

695
00:49:27,639 --> 00:49:30,710
There's only one person
that comes to mind.

696
00:49:33,809 --> 00:49:34,980
Whatever.

697
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:38,210
Bong Sang Pil, consider this...

698
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:40,449
your lucky day.

699
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,429
(Sunghan General Hospital)

700
00:49:55,829 --> 00:49:58,570
You have some nerve
growling like that.

701
00:50:02,039 --> 00:50:04,670
I'm grateful for the protection,
but you should eat.

702
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:06,010
We're busted.

703
00:50:06,139 --> 00:50:07,280
What about you?

704
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:09,139
I'll eat once I'm done.

705
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:11,480
Then we'll head downstairs...

706
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,849
and quickly polish
a bowl of soup and rice.

707
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:16,719
- We should go.
- Right.

708
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:17,719
It's delicious.

709
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:27,030
So, a chasm is forming between the
crocodile and the crocodile bird.

710
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:30,800
A crocodile that can eat anything...

711
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,829
that crosses her mouth at any time.

712
00:50:33,539 --> 00:50:34,570
It's Cha Moon Sook.

713
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:54,989
- Get the door!
- Yes, sir.

714
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:56,989
Attorney Ha!

715
00:50:56,989 --> 00:50:58,360
- Did anything happen?
- No, sir.

716
00:50:58,829 --> 00:50:59,829
Sang Pil!

717
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:02,030
Jae I...

718
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,210
- Get the first aid kit.
- Yes, sir.

719
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:13,179
Oh no...

720
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:15,809
You're okay.

721
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:17,579
I'm glad.

722
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:20,219
What happened? How did you get here?

723
00:51:20,449 --> 00:51:22,179
Something happened at the hospital.

724
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,690
I thought you'd be in danger too.

725
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,460
Shouldn't we call an ambulance?

726
00:51:29,559 --> 00:51:31,030
- No, don't.
- Sorry?

727
00:51:31,389 --> 00:51:32,460
Don't.

728
00:51:37,869 --> 00:51:39,969
I'm good. It's all right.

729
00:51:45,239 --> 00:51:48,510
Prosecutor Cheon,
it's Attorney Ha Jae I.

730
00:51:49,949 --> 00:51:52,050
Bong Sang Pil is here.

731
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:54,980
Please come quickly
to Lawless Law Firm.

732
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:58,989
What do we do?
We're out of ointments.

733
00:51:58,989 --> 00:52:00,119
How so?

734
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:02,360
We should go to the pharmacy!

735
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:04,059
Hurry.

736
00:52:06,699 --> 00:52:09,000
You shouldn't have come here
in this state.

737
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:13,000
My heart nearly exploded
on my way over here.

738
00:52:13,769 --> 00:52:15,239
I was so worried about you.

739
00:52:17,969 --> 00:52:19,309
I made a promise, you see.

740
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:21,239
What promise?

741
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:24,880
I will always protect you.

742
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:27,920
That's what I promised myself.

743
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:30,889
You're unbelievable.

744
00:52:33,019 --> 00:52:35,659
That's the kind of promise
you make with me.

745
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:40,460
Are you all right?

746
00:52:48,969 --> 00:52:49,969
Sang Pil.

747
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:10,690
Boss.

748
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:13,960
Boss.

749
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:16,869
What's wrong?

750
00:53:17,369 --> 00:53:18,829
Who did this?

751
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:22,599
Please tell me.
I'll move out with the guys.

752
00:53:23,539 --> 00:53:25,440
Who did this to you?

753
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:27,179
I'm glad you say that.

754
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,110
Who would dare...

755
00:53:34,679 --> 00:53:37,090
to do this to me, An Oh Ju?

756
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:40,420
Who do you think it is?

757
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,269
Bong Sang Pil.

758
00:53:55,369 --> 00:53:56,369
You rascal.

759
00:53:56,639 --> 00:53:58,139
You must've been surprised, Jae I.

760
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:04,550
Get up.

761
00:54:05,679 --> 00:54:07,679
I'm still a patient.

762
00:54:08,019 --> 00:54:09,619
Right, a patient.

763
00:54:09,619 --> 00:54:10,750
You're an escaped convict.

764
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:14,659
- Gosh, it hurts.
- I'll take him.

765
00:54:14,659 --> 00:54:16,289
- He's sick.
- Prosecutor Cheon.

766
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:20,230
We should take Sang Pil
to the hospital now.

767
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:21,829
Since you called me immediately,

768
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:24,769
I won't make a thing of him
escaping from the hospital.

769
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,969
And we still need to settle
a few things.

770
00:54:28,039 --> 00:54:29,900
Thank you, Prosecutor Cheon.

771
00:54:31,869 --> 00:54:32,869
Let's go.

772
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:34,780
- Okay.
- Yes, sir.

773
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:36,340
Sang Pil.

774
00:54:36,579 --> 00:54:37,780
Sang Pil.

775
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:02,670
Before Choi Dae Woong died,
he was looking for a Thai woman.

776
00:55:02,969 --> 00:55:04,070
A Thai woman?

777
00:55:04,369 --> 00:55:05,570
Yes, ma'am.

778
00:55:05,909 --> 00:55:07,539
But she seemed to be Korean.

779
00:55:07,539 --> 00:55:08,539
She did?

780
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:13,150
I'm telling you this as it's weird
that he went to Kiseong to find her.

781
00:55:27,159 --> 00:55:29,059
Did you say your name was Mama?

782
00:55:30,429 --> 00:55:31,429
Yes, ma'am.

783
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:35,940
Mama.

784
00:55:37,809 --> 00:55:39,070
It's a good name.

785
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:51,820
A scuffle broke out in a hospital
in the middle of the night.

786
00:55:52,519 --> 00:55:54,059
- Hey.
- Attorney Bong, the suspect...

787
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:57,130
in the murder case
of Choi Dae Woong...

788
00:55:58,929 --> 00:55:59,960
Well...

789
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:04,670
Call Editor-in-chief Han now.

790
00:56:05,769 --> 00:56:07,900
Tell him to make sure...

791
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:11,469
my name won't be mentioned
in the case.

792
00:56:13,309 --> 00:56:14,309
Yes, sir.

793
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,309
The mayor shouldn't be involved...

794
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:21,320
in a brawl of bullies like you.

795
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,719
It will only jeopardize
the administration.

796
00:56:24,389 --> 00:56:25,719
As your aide...

797
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:28,389
I can't take this anymore.

798
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,960
You better watch
what you're talking about.

799
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,929
When I was a thug in Seoul,

800
00:56:33,929 --> 00:56:36,659
I would always get my own way.

801
00:56:36,869 --> 00:56:40,869
But after I became your aide,

802
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:43,570
there's nothing I can do.

803
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:51,380
What did you say?

804
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,150
Please forgive me.

805
00:56:55,650 --> 00:56:57,789
Politics suit you better.

806
00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:01,320
Can you prove yourself as
the mayor of Kiseong?

807
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,489
About Ohju Group's blind trust...

808
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:06,329
Everything is going smoothly
without any problems, right?

809
00:57:06,329 --> 00:57:08,130
Forget the blind trust.

810
00:57:09,829 --> 00:57:12,130
You should just donate it
to my father's foundation.

811
00:57:13,969 --> 00:57:15,739
What do you mean...

812
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:18,610
What is it?
Don't you trust my judgment?

813
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:25,579
I lost my reason in front of you.

814
00:57:26,179 --> 00:57:27,179
It's okay.

815
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:30,449
Never mind.

816
00:57:30,949 --> 00:57:31,949
Pardon?

817
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:37,659
You just woke me from...

818
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:39,659
my sweet dream now.

819
00:57:41,829 --> 00:57:45,769
I'm so sorry. Please forgive me.

820
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:50,000
Why would Judge Cha
make me mayor?

821
00:57:57,809 --> 00:57:58,949
My money.

822
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:02,920
My hands and feet.

823
00:58:03,989 --> 00:58:05,750
She'll take them all...

824
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,420
and get rid of them.

825
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:10,829
Is that it,

826
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:13,329
Cha Moon Sook?

827
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:33,679
Let's go, Attorney Ha.

828
00:58:35,019 --> 00:58:36,079
Let's go.

829
00:58:36,889 --> 00:58:38,489
You look pretty.

830
00:58:51,699 --> 00:58:54,500
What do you want from me?

831
00:58:57,710 --> 00:59:00,539
(The 2nd hearing of the murder
case of Choi Dae Woong)

832
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:02,039
Are you all right?

833
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:03,139
Yes, I'm okay.

834
00:59:10,989 --> 00:59:13,250
What's wrong? Did something happen?

835
00:59:14,389 --> 00:59:15,590
You might be surprised...

836
00:59:16,289 --> 00:59:17,929
during the hearing.

837
00:59:18,929 --> 00:59:20,030
Hey.

838
00:59:20,659 --> 00:59:22,429
I guess you have
your ace in the hole.

839
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,000
I knew it.

840
00:59:24,429 --> 00:59:25,429
I...

841
00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:28,969
will prove your innocence
no matter what.

842
00:59:31,269 --> 00:59:32,840
The judge is entering.

843
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:34,539
All rise.

844
00:59:47,389 --> 00:59:48,719
Please be seated.

845
00:59:53,059 --> 00:59:54,630
We'll now begin the second trial...

846
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:56,929
for the Choi Dae Woong murder case.

847
00:59:57,630 --> 00:59:58,630
Your Honor.

848
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:00,670
We want a witness to be summoned.

849
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:03,440
I didn't hear...

850
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:06,909
anything about a witness
for the accused.

851
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,579
We have a new witness.

852
01:00:11,849 --> 01:00:14,320
What's the opinion
of the prosecution?

853
01:00:14,619 --> 01:00:15,949
We cannot accept it.

854
01:00:16,619 --> 01:00:19,090
We have no prior consultation.

855
01:00:19,090 --> 01:00:21,159
We just found the witness
this morning,

856
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:22,889
so we failed to follow
the procedure.

857
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:32,800
If this is about
the reliability of the witness,

858
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,670
I believe...

859
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:37,070
his position will guarantee
his reliability.

860
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:41,809
Who is the witness?

861
01:00:56,489 --> 01:00:59,730
He's the Mayor of Kiseong, An Oh Ju.

862
01:01:25,219 --> 01:01:26,820
Judge Cha Moon Sook.

863
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:30,590
I, Mayor An Oh Ju,

864
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:35,199
will speak the truth with my name.

865
01:01:40,369 --> 01:01:41,369
Bong Sang Pil...

866
01:01:42,469 --> 01:01:44,739
who's sitting right over there...

867
01:01:48,739 --> 01:01:50,179
isn't the culprit.

868
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:30,550
(Lawless Lawyer)

869
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:33,489
Did you make a deal
with An Oh Ju for me?

870
01:02:33,489 --> 01:02:35,289
We just share the same interests.

871
01:02:35,289 --> 01:02:36,789
If your mom is alive,

872
01:02:36,789 --> 01:02:40,090
will you go back to what you were?

873
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:42,000
Cha Moon Sook and I...

874
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,269
are already at war.

875
01:02:44,269 --> 01:02:46,070
An Oh Ju, how dare you.

876
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:48,269
It's now going to be twice
as difficult for you,

877
01:02:48,269 --> 01:02:49,269
so what's your plan?

878
01:02:49,269 --> 01:02:51,670
The day you stand
in Kiseong District Court...

879
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:54,239
is the day
the law of Kiseong crumbles.

880
01:02:54,239 --> 01:02:55,679
We're now at total war.

881
01:02:56,010 --> 01:02:59,050
Uncle, I'm sorry for
going against your dying wishes.
