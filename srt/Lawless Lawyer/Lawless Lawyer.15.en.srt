(Episode 15)

8
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,210
Jae I. Jae I!

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,710
Sang Pil?

10
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:45,350
I see he scurried over.

11
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,450
This is why...

12
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,520
I needed an extra body.

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,990
Sang Pil seems to be
highly agitated.

14
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,329
You make sure she
doesn't go anywhere.

15
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:55,659
Yes, sir!

16
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:00,130
Don't you dare think about
using me to blackmail him.

17
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:01,570
Sit down.

18
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:02,570
Shut up!

19
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:05,299
Gosh,
what should I do with this wench?

20
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:09,010
- Sang Pil.
- Bong Sang Pil!

21
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,879
Where are you hiding Jae I?

22
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:14,909
Why do you want to know?

23
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,650
You said you have something
that you want to protect.

24
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,590
I also have things that I must
protect, you little punk.

25
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:28,030
Hey, An Oh Ju.

26
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:30,760
You're already a broken plate.

27
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:35,200
I don't have the power to glue back
the broken pieces together.

28
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:37,040
In fact, no one does.

29
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:39,900
So just accept it already.

30
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,310
My goodness.

31
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,680
Killing me is your end goal,
isn't it?

32
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,120
I came all the way here in person
like this...

33
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,260
to give you a chance
to do just that.

34
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:04,260
Look at you.
I must say, you have quite a nerve.

35
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:06,799
You're doing all this
to save your woman.

36
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:10,599
I'll grant you your wish.

37
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,879
You can't beat me, you little rat.

38
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,810
On your knees.

39
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:22,710
I told you
to get down on your knees.

40
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,379
That's strange.

41
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:29,449
My boss has a gun.

42
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,560
- What did you say?
- You didn't hear a gunshot, right?

43
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:34,659
Is he dead?

44
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,460
You stay right there,
or I'll teach you a lesson.

45
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,110
I told you to stay...

46
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,050
I'll look after Ha Jae I for you,

47
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:04,020
so don't worry.

48
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,960
I'll count to three.

49
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:11,099
Goodbye.

50
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,569
One.

51
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,870
Two.

52
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,939
I'll count to three.
Just to three, okay?

53
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,169
One.

54
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,680
Two.

55
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:26,979
An Oh Ju!

56
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,509
Jae I.

57
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:31,919
Stop.

58
00:03:36,289 --> 00:03:39,020
Hey, what is going on here?

59
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,430
I'm sorry, Boss. She kicked me here,
so my hip bone and ribs are...

60
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:45,460
You idiot. You ruined
the highlight of my day.

61
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:46,930
Jae I.

62
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:59,439
Cha Moon Sook sent this to Sang Pil.

63
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:04,379
In other words,
she used him to get rid of you.

64
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,719
What's this?

65
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,199
That notebook...

66
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,939
will help you make your decision.

67
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:30,379
(2016, Go In Du)

68
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:35,750
You.

69
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:39,980
You said you have evidence
that can destroy Cha Moon Sook.

70
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,050
I never had such evidence
from the get-go.

71
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,160
Attorney Ha Jae I.

72
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,430
(An Oh Ju)

73
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,730
(An Oh Ju, Killed Kim Ho Sik, Choi
Jin Ae, and Noh Hyun Joo in 2000)

74
00:04:59,769 --> 00:05:00,810
So...

75
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,709
you're saying Cha Moon Sook
planned everything...

76
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:07,810
You were...

77
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,319
nothing but her faithful tool.

78
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:14,189
You see,

79
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,589
we can't undo what has already
happened anyway.

80
00:05:20,589 --> 00:05:21,629
Am I right, An Oh Ju?

81
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:25,160
Did you know about this
from the get-go?

82
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:30,500
I'm asking you if you've known
about this all along, you punk.

83
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,439
You two, do you know of a way...

84
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:39,240
to take down Cha Moon Sook?

85
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:40,810
"A way"?

86
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,949
We do, of course.

87
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:45,879
But it depends on your decision.

88
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,490
What is it?

89
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:51,959
It involves you appearing in court.

90
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,160
Come to the courtroom...

91
00:05:55,329 --> 00:05:57,459
and prove
all of Cha Moon Sook's wrongdoings.

92
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,800
Look at this punk.

93
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,639
You know that the police
are on the lookout for me now.

94
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:10,040
You're doing this
to put me behind bars, aren't you?

95
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:14,509
You see, you're bound to be caught
eventually.

96
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,579
Why would the untouchable An Oh Ju
be worried?

97
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,050
And you know...

98
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:24,819
that my end goal is taking down
Cha Moon Sook.

99
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,500
Right.

100
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:37,670
Dying by a bullet...

101
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,569
isn't exactly my style.

102
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:50,149
Let's do this my way.

103
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:56,149
Hey, you. Attorney Ha Jae I.

104
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:00,189
There's one bullet inside this now.

105
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,829
Take it.

106
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,160
All right.

107
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:08,500
One of us is bound to die
in this game anyway.

108
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:10,069
I said, take the gun.

109
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,970
This is my style.

110
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,769
Take it if you think
you can handle it. Take it!

111
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:23,920
Shall we do this?

112
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,089
Get ready, Bong Sang Pil.

113
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,060
It'll be okay, Jae I.

114
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,089
Go hide somewhere.

115
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:42,129
All right.

116
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I've been waiting for this day
as well.

117
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:10,259
Darn it!

118
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,629
- Gwan Dong.
- Yes, Boss.

119
00:09:30,809 --> 00:09:32,610
Fine, I'll testify in court.

120
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,519
What can you do for me in return?

121
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,090
A plea deal.

122
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,820
It'll be the best way to help you
get your sentence mitigated.

123
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:49,429
If you decide to cooperate,

124
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:52,299
your charges will be dropped
so that you can appear in court.

125
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:56,730
Are you saying
you'll cancel the APB on me?

126
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,500
That's right.

127
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,240
How can I trust you?

128
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,980
All you have to do
is testify in the courtroom.

129
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,679
We'll have to end this game
right there and then.

130
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,820
That was a long break.

131
00:10:15,289 --> 00:10:16,549
Bring it on.

132
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,620
I knew talking to you
would be useless.

133
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,059
Enough!

134
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,870
Stop, Sang Pil.

135
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,299
Bong Sang Pil.

136
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,440
That's enough.

137
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,700
If you do it,

138
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,710
everything you did will disappear.

139
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:18,809
Stop it.

140
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,149
Stop it.

141
00:12:38,059 --> 00:12:40,600
- Bribery!
- She didn't do it!

142
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,100
- Serving justice!
- That's what she did!

143
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,440
Cha Moon Sook!

144
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,169
(We believe in Cha Moon Sook)

145
00:12:47,169 --> 00:12:48,740
She fights for justice!

146
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,440
- Cha Moon Sook...
- There she is.

147
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,179
- She's here.
- Cha Moon Sook.

148
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:57,179
- Cha Moon Sook, Cha Moon Sook.
- Cha Moon Sook, Cha Moon Sook.

149
00:12:57,179 --> 00:12:58,950
- Judge!
- Good luck.

150
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,490
Bring justice back to
Kiseong's court.

151
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,419
- We believe in you!
- That's right.

152
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:06,259
- You'll win.
- Cha Moon Sook.

153
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:09,590
- Cha Moon Sook, Cha Moon Sook.
- Lock up An Oh Ju!

154
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:13,399
- Do what you can for us!
- Cha Moon Sook, Cha Moon Sook.

155
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:16,629
- We believe in you!
- We trust in you.

156
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,370
- We're right behind you.
- We believe you!

157
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:22,940
- We support you!
- Judge Cha!

158
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:26,480
Yes, boss. Is Attorney Ha safe?

159
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,009
Yes. We're on our way.

160
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:31,379
That's great to hear.

161
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,950
The protest here just ended.
We'll come over.

162
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:35,850
Okay, see you soon.

163
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,460
Do you think An Oh Ju
will take your offer?

164
00:13:47,669 --> 00:13:50,100
He only has two options.

165
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,500
He goes down on his own...

166
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:55,269
or takes Cha Moon Sook with him.

167
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:00,840
He's the only witness
who can harm her.

168
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:02,779
You're right.

169
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:07,419
His life as Cha Moon Sook's
dog itself is evidence.

170
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,759
The notebook will help him
make a choice.

171
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:18,230
Cha Moon Sook's blade
will become a boomerang...

172
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:20,200
and attack her instead.

173
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,370
I'll see to that.

174
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,210
You won't take up
his deal, will you?

175
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,779
He's a real snake.

176
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:39,580
Just look at his face.
He looks like this.

177
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:43,590
Who can guarantee he's not
working with Cha Moon Sook?

178
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:46,789
Look at her face.
She looks like this.

179
00:14:46,789 --> 00:14:47,889
They're on the same side.

180
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:51,559
Yes, boss,
you might think I'm stupid,

181
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:54,629
but my instinct is right.
They're up to something.

182
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:57,429
If you believe them,
you'll go under.

183
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:00,570
That old friend of yours
that you really liked.

184
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:02,769
That attorney.

185
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,080
Choi Jin Ae?

186
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,480
That woman.

187
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:11,450
Go away.

188
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,279
Pardon?

189
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,519
- Then...
- I get it. Go away.

190
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:20,490
You just bark when I say...

191
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:23,629
and bite when I say. You're my dog.

192
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:27,830
After all that...

193
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,230
You'll go down.

194
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:40,809
Instead of Bong Sang Pil,

195
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,450
with these hands,

196
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,649
I'll drag down...

197
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,590
Cha Moon Sook.

198
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,120
I'll do it.

199
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,600
Putting Judge Hong back up there...

200
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,269
will just ruin everything.

201
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,070
There's word that...

202
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:08,509
Chairman Jo Young Joon's
already cutting ties with him.

203
00:16:08,909 --> 00:16:11,809
He cares a lot
what the public thinks.

204
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:15,610
You know the media's
making a huge fuss about...

205
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:18,120
how we're being paid
to give lower sentences.

206
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:23,019
I think that
you should be the one...

207
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,190
to sentence Nam Soon Ja.

208
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,360
Use this case to cement your chances
at becoming Chief Justice.

209
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,700
I'll think about it.

210
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,940
Leave for now.

211
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,539
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

212
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,450
Judge Cha Moon Sook from Kiseong...

213
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:52,220
will soon attend
her appointment hearing.

214
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,250
The nation is interested
because there's talk that...

215
00:16:55,250 --> 00:17:00,720
Judge Cha will run for president
after her stint as chief justice...

216
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,360
Her as president?

217
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,099
I just want to leave this country.
Let's go to Hawaii.

218
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:07,460
Can you afford to?

219
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,769
As if.

220
00:17:08,769 --> 00:17:10,130
Will your leaving help?

221
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,470
Then what?
She might become president.

222
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,269
There's nothing we can do.

223
00:17:14,269 --> 00:17:17,109
Why aren't Attorney Bong
and Jae I back yet?

224
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:18,579
Did something happen
on their way back?

225
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,910
I doubt that.

226
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:22,410
Boss. Boss.

227
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,650
My gosh.

228
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,549
- Oh dear.
- Attorney Ha.

229
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:27,619
- Jae I.
- Are you hurt?

230
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:29,589
I'm fine. Attorney Bong
came right over.

231
00:17:29,589 --> 00:17:32,960
Look at all this blood.
Are you hurt, Attorney Bong?

232
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,059
I'm okay.

233
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,390
There isn't a day
that goes by quietly.

234
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:38,359
I'm just furious.

235
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:43,170
Right. We should use that fury
to put Cha Moon Sook on the stand.

236
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,769
- Okay?
- Yes.

237
00:17:44,769 --> 00:17:47,369
Give the order whenever you need us.

238
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:19,099
It looks like your late father
is helping you.

239
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,569
I came straight over to Kiseong.

240
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,839
What do you mean?

241
00:18:26,509 --> 00:18:27,809
I saw the news.

242
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,779
This trial is a great opportunity.

243
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,349
Of course, you're behind it.

244
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,420
You are just like your father.

245
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,119
Am I?

246
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:43,589
It's the best trial
as your last in Kiseong.

247
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,869
I'm sure it will work in
your favor at the hearing too.

248
00:18:56,809 --> 00:18:59,109
(Lawless Law Firm)

249
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:01,250
Okay.

250
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,220
Cha Moon Sook took on
Nam Soon Ja's trial.

251
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,950
It worked. We did it.

252
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:12,190
We helped you achieve something.

253
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,859
I feel so good.

254
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:17,190
The public sentiment
swayed even her.

255
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:20,299
Attorney Bong,
you must win this time.

256
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,900
It'll be her last trial as a judge.

257
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,269
It should be.

258
00:19:25,269 --> 00:19:27,940
She sat up there for way too long.

259
00:19:28,369 --> 00:19:29,740
As an arrogant judge.

260
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:33,809
She'll come down very soon.

261
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:36,750
To celebrate our success,

262
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,019
- we'll go out for some cold beer.
- Sounds good.

263
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:41,619
Will you join us?

264
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:43,390
No, you guys go ahead.

265
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,920
- Yes, boss. Let's go!
- Let's go.

266
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,130
We did it.

267
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,589
Beer, beer.

268
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,230
Boss.

269
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,500
What are you going to do?

270
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,039
Wouldn't it be better to just
take Bong Sang Pil's offer?

271
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,410
If you're that afraid,
you can run off first.

272
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:03,609
It's not that I'm afraid.

273
00:20:03,609 --> 00:20:05,680
I'm trying to think of you.

274
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:10,279
I will stay with you until the end.

275
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:14,049
Is that true?
That's so typical of you.

276
00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:16,849
Let go of me.
I can't see out the window.

277
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:24,089
Boss. I'll go and bring
Cha Moon Sook right over to you.

278
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,279
I don't believe this.

279
00:20:40,009 --> 00:20:42,210
She hired bodyguards. That's unfair.

280
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:44,720
This isn't your style.

281
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,319
Why would she be afraid of us?

282
00:20:55,059 --> 00:20:56,059
It's me.

283
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,130
I heard all about
your little notepad.

284
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,299
You used Bong Sang Pil
to get rid of me.

285
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,200
But know this.

286
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,170
If you really thought
of me as your pet dog,

287
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,410
you wouldn't have used me like this.

288
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,279
You have no right raising a dog.

289
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:22,349
Just remember that
I'm always in your near vicinity.

290
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,750
An Oh Ju.

291
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,789
If you wish to threaten me,

292
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,490
do it face to face.

293
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,190
Come to my residence,
if you have anything to say.

294
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,339
What did she say?

295
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:43,569
That's right.
This is more your style,

296
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:45,609
Cha Moon Sook.

297
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:54,319
- Hello?
- Bong Sang Pil.

298
00:21:54,619 --> 00:21:56,950
Is Judge Cha really
presiding over my trial?

299
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:59,990
You come here immediately!
Right now!

300
00:22:03,329 --> 00:22:04,589
I need to go.

301
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:06,259
To Nam Soon Ja?

302
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:07,759
Yes.

303
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,869
- Then I'm going too.
- Really?

304
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,509
I'm participating in the trial
as your co-counsel.

305
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,880
I had that idea too,

306
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,849
but I thought it'd be
too difficult for you.

307
00:22:24,849 --> 00:22:27,349
Cha Moon Sook's the presiding judge,

308
00:22:27,349 --> 00:22:28,950
so we need to pressure her.

309
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:31,759
Pressure her?

310
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:37,029
So...

311
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:42,569
Jae I, what are you doing here?

312
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:46,970
I guess the guilt is preventing you
from looking into my eyes.

313
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:49,109
What on earth is going on?

314
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,740
Please have a seat.

315
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:53,710
I'll be in court as his co-counsel.

316
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,250
Is she serious?

317
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,319
She'll defend me in court?

318
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:01,549
The contract you signed
was with Lawless Law Firm.

319
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:04,490
Also, she'll give us
a strategic advantage.

320
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,259
What strategy?

321
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,859
Think about it.
What better card is there...

322
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,230
to agitate Cha Moon Sook?

323
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,809
Jae I, about your mom...

324
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:28,309
I didn't know
it was your mom at first.

325
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:29,309
I know.

326
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:32,119
That's why I'm not going after you,

327
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,619
but Cha Moon Sook.

328
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:40,859
All right then.
Let's get ready for your next trial.

329
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,430
I'll be presiding over...

330
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,569
your mom's trial.

331
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,440
What?

332
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:57,769
Does that mean I can finally
stop worrying, ma'am?

333
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,309
I see that all the worrying
really got to you.

334
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:06,549
I feel terrible about
your mom's case too.

335
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,019
However,
the evidence is quite strong.

336
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,759
Judge Cha,

337
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:15,029
my mom has been your aide
all her life.

338
00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:17,059
If you could...

339
00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:18,799
There's only one way.

340
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:24,329
You must get her to admit
to all her crimes in my court.

341
00:24:24,769 --> 00:24:25,769
Wait.

342
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,869
Are you telling her
to take all the blame?

343
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:34,640
I'm sure you know that
I'll be the next chief justice.

344
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:38,519
Yes.

345
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:46,359
Also, you said that
you wanted to be by my side.

346
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,630
So choose.

347
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,799
Have your mother
admit to her crimes...

348
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:53,430
and wrap this all up,

349
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,630
or let her take...

350
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:58,940
you down as well.

351
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:03,940
I'm a woman who
is in the public eye.

352
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:07,109
I can't protect everyone
that has been loyal to me.

353
00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:10,049
You must understand that...

354
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,650
if you wish to be with me.

355
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,450
All right?

356
00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:22,829
Editor-in-chief Han will testify
on behalf of the prosecution.

357
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:24,029
What?

358
00:25:24,329 --> 00:25:27,200
Editor-in-chief Han
is on the prosecution's side?

359
00:25:31,069 --> 00:25:33,369
His testimony will add weight
to the video evidence.

360
00:25:33,369 --> 00:25:35,869
Even after all the favors
I've done for him,

361
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:38,140
he's throwing me under the bus!

362
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:43,250
Members of The Seven
all use each other anyway.

363
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:47,980
You're both guilty,
but he's putting it all on you.

364
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,690
You can't just let him.

365
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:54,089
You've never been the one
to let others run you over.

366
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,890
That piece of scum.

367
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,359
While he trailed behind me...

368
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,299
in hopes of getting a rake-off,

369
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,910
he still spoke ill of me
for being under-educated.

370
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:12,680
Darn! That little rat.

371
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,410
Darn it!

372
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,519
I knew you were
a courageous attorney,

373
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:19,950
but you're also invincible.

374
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:23,789
Lawless and invincible,
isn't that a perfect combination?

375
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,589
Yes, it's perfect.

376
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:29,430
That reminds me.
I need to see Kwon Man Bae.

377
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:31,390
Are you calling him
as a witness tomorrow?

378
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,400
Yes.

379
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,230
He's been holding out,

380
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,029
but I'll get my answer today.

381
00:26:42,569 --> 00:26:45,240
So have you made up your mind?

382
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,410
You want me to testify
in front of Cha Moon Sook.

383
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:51,210
- Yes.
- That's the reason why Sang Pil...

384
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:52,579
let you live.

385
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:54,519
Is that so?

386
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:56,119
I'm grateful.

387
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:59,420
You only need to say
what you saw and heard.

388
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,230
All right.

389
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:06,660
Can I make a phone call?

390
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:08,900
It's my mother's birthday today.

391
00:27:34,289 --> 00:27:35,759
Judge Cha, it's me.

392
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,769
Do you trust that weasel?

393
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,700
No.

394
00:27:44,869 --> 00:27:47,700
Then what's your plan with him?

395
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,839
He'll never testify
in the way we want him to.

396
00:27:52,109 --> 00:27:54,380
Then what should I do with him?

397
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,779
You'll be coming to court
instead of him.

398
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,279
Show yourself and
make Judge Cha sweat.

399
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:06,059
You can count on me
to have your back with the rest.

400
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:08,730
I already know that you will.

401
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:11,089
I'll make sure you come out soon.

402
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:12,099
All right.

403
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,259
Then I'll see you in court.

404
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,569
Yes, sir.

405
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:25,180
(Kiseong District Court)

406
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,779
Is it finally beginning?

407
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:35,019
We endured so much
just to get to this point.

408
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:44,829
Are you confident?

409
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:46,799
Of course.

410
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:49,700
I came this far, didn't I?

411
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:52,200
You, me, and Cha Moon Sook.

412
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,769
We're all standing
on the tip of a blade.

413
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:56,970
You can never...

414
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:58,940
let your guard down with her.

415
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,279
Right.

416
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:04,109
As the presiding judge,

417
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:06,779
she'll definitely come prepared.

418
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,220
Let's...

419
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:15,329
see this through, Jae I.

420
00:29:50,329 --> 00:29:51,329
Have a seat.

421
00:29:55,269 --> 00:29:56,369
I know it's hard.

422
00:29:58,269 --> 00:30:01,769
I already know where
you stand with me,

423
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,769
so why are you trying to confuse me?

424
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,910
I've thought about it,

425
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:15,420
and you obviously did all of this
because you care about me lot.

426
00:30:16,089 --> 00:30:18,619
You're figuring that out now?

427
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,630
Still, you committed a crime,

428
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,630
and you must stand trial.

429
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:27,829
Are you saying all of this
just to antagonize me?

430
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:34,069
Your daughter's
worried sick about you.

431
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:40,940
Think of her first
when you make your choice.

432
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:44,410
To be honest,

433
00:30:45,619 --> 00:30:47,849
she comes first to me,
even before you.

434
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,359
That's totally understandable.
All moms would feel that way.

435
00:30:58,829 --> 00:30:59,930
Will you...

436
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,970
continue to protect Yeon Hee?

437
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,509
Seok Gwan Dong does an alley-oop!

438
00:31:16,549 --> 00:31:18,750
Give me that 5,000 dollars.

439
00:31:19,349 --> 00:31:20,420
Here you go, Boss.

440
00:31:22,819 --> 00:31:24,049
How about we bet...

441
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:26,720
10,000 dollars this time?

442
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:28,990
I'll do it again
if you lend me the money.

443
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:31,059
- Really?
- Yes, Boss.

444
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,700
And I wanted to ask you

445
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,460
if you've been checking...

446
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,200
on what's going on with the trial.

447
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,940
Secretary Kim called me earlier...

448
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:41,940
and told me that he managed to plant
one of our guys in the audience.

449
00:31:42,069 --> 00:31:45,170
He also said he'd give us updates,
but I forgot to tell you.

450
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,539
All right. This time,
the bet is 10,000 dollars.

451
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,210
Yes, Boss.

452
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:52,250
Is a three-point field goal allowed?

453
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,819
Yes, go.

454
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,289
10,000 dollars!

455
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,289
Take it all, you jerk.

456
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:05,130
The judges are entering. All rise.

457
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,130
(The second trial for confining...)

458
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,559
(and soliciting to murder
a Thai acupressurist)

459
00:32:17,309 --> 00:32:19,009
We'll begin the trial.

460
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,319
Get rid of her.

461
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,720
Toss her in the sea
so that no one can ever find her.

462
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,359
You want her dead?

463
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,220
Yes.

464
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,089
Do you not take me seriously?

465
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,799
My words equal the judge's words.

466
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:43,900
It's her order!

467
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,299
You got that?

468
00:32:46,769 --> 00:32:48,140
The video you just watched...

469
00:32:48,339 --> 00:32:51,269
is evidence that shows
the defendant, Nam Soon Ja,

470
00:32:51,609 --> 00:32:54,279
giving an unidentified man
a kill order.

471
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:59,650
I'd like to bring
Mr. Han Tae Kyeong in as a witness.

472
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:05,359
Editor-in-chief of Kiseong Daily,
Mr. Han Tae Kyeong.

473
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:09,059
What's your relationship
with the defendant?

474
00:33:10,329 --> 00:33:13,559
I've known her since
I was just a reporter.

475
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,329
How would you describe her?

476
00:33:16,529 --> 00:33:19,700
The video clip that you all
just watched is nothing.

477
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,369
You've only seen
the tip of the iceberg.

478
00:33:22,869 --> 00:33:26,440
She always bragged about
how close her family is...

479
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,410
to Judge Cha Byung Ho's family
and acted all entitled.

480
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:32,650
Have you witnessed
any specific incidents?

481
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:36,049
When I visited Judge Cha's residence
in the past,

482
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:39,019
I witnessed her being
abusive verbally and physically,

483
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:40,990
as well as worse things at times.

484
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:43,960
According to the maids there,

485
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:48,059
Ms. Nam Soon Ja's such abusive
behaviors were quite notorious.

486
00:33:53,369 --> 00:33:54,470
Your Honor,

487
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,339
I'd like to submit a statement...

488
00:33:56,509 --> 00:33:58,170
from one of the maids
that work at the residence...

489
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:01,539
to back up what the witness
just told us.

490
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:06,319
What's the statement about?

491
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:10,349
It's about how
the defendant, Nam Soon Ja,

492
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:13,889
belittled and insulted the Thai
acupressurist on a regular basis.

493
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,789
What are you doing? Pick them up.

494
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,429
Are you going to thank me just once?

495
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:22,800
Thank you, ma'am. Thank you, ma'am.

496
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:24,300
I believe...

497
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,739
that this case is the outcome...

498
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,710
of the defendant's such behaviors.

499
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,010
That'd be all, Your Honor.

500
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,809
Defense Attorney,
you may question the witness now.

501
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:46,019
Mr. Han Tae Kyeong.

502
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:50,730
Do you know to whom
Ms. Nam was referring...

503
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:52,130
by "the judge" in the video clip?

504
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,599
I believe that was...

505
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:02,139
all explained during
the prosecution's questioning.

506
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,510
You may ask a different question...

507
00:35:05,909 --> 00:35:09,579
or return to your seat if you don't
have any questions to ask.

508
00:35:09,949 --> 00:35:13,019
Then I'll ask a different question.

509
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,550
Witness, you are
a media powerhouse who is...

510
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:18,789
very influential in Kiseong, right?

511
00:35:19,059 --> 00:35:21,659
That's what people say.

512
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:24,159
The witness is
a powerful media figure.

513
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:27,130
I'd like to know why he's stayed
close to Ms. Nam Soon Ja,

514
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:29,599
who doesn't even have a real job,
for 35 years.

515
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,699
Could you please explain to us?

516
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,670
Attorney Ha,

517
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,340
why are you asking such a question?

518
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:40,809
What would the reason be?

519
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,809
Since the defendant is
close with Judge Cha Moon Sook,

520
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,820
you probably thought maintaining
a close relationship with her...

521
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:49,420
could help you generate
financial gains.

522
00:35:49,789 --> 00:35:51,519
No, that was never my intention.

523
00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:52,659
Defense Attorney.

524
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,630
Please refrain from making
unconfirmed claims.

525
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,760
You were the first
journalist in Kiseong...

526
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,630
to receive
the Korean Journalists' Award.

527
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,230
Can you swear on it?

528
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,500
Why should I...

529
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:06,099
swear on my honor because of
such a ridiculous claim?

530
00:36:06,769 --> 00:36:08,139
I've already given my oath
as a witness.

531
00:36:08,139 --> 00:36:11,570
Is the defendant too far below
your league for you to do that?

532
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:12,639
I...

533
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,610
don't judge and categorize people
like that.

534
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,550
According to the defendant,

535
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,820
you've taken a lot of kickbacks
using your relationship with her.

536
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,880
"Kickbacks"?

537
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:23,949
If there were any kickbacks,

538
00:36:25,289 --> 00:36:26,760
she must've taken them herself.

539
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,519
Will you not regret saying that?

540
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,460
Why would I regret...

541
00:36:37,269 --> 00:36:40,139
According to the defendant
and the staff at the residence,

542
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,269
you were always servile
to the defendant and treated her...

543
00:36:43,269 --> 00:36:44,710
as if she was above you.

544
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:48,480
Why did you treat her like that?

545
00:36:48,579 --> 00:36:51,880
Was it your way of showing
your loyalty to her?

546
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,079
"Loyalty"?

547
00:36:55,949 --> 00:36:57,250
What? "Loyalty"?

548
00:36:57,889 --> 00:37:00,159
I guess you don't know much
about Nam Soon Ja.

549
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:01,789
That woman...

550
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:04,829
She's very...

551
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:10,130
She's extremely crude.
She has no class.

552
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:12,170
- What did you say?
- She brags about her rich family...

553
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:15,099
- to gain favors from people!
- What? Do you have proof?

554
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,469
It looks like
you've been holding grudges.

555
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:19,840
"Grudges"? No, not at all.

556
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,280
According to
one of the statements we obtained,

557
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,280
the witness threatened
the defendant on a regular basis...

558
00:37:26,449 --> 00:37:28,250
because he felt that
he got the least...

559
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,650
out of the Golden City
redevelopment project...

560
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:34,119
even though he worked the hardest
when the project was underway.

561
00:37:34,289 --> 00:37:35,460
What? I threatened you?

562
00:37:35,789 --> 00:37:37,030
- Hey.
- What?

563
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,090
- Hey.
- "Hey"?

564
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,559
I published so many articles
about Golden City for you!

565
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:41,599
- How ungrateful.
- So what?

566
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,730
- Gosh.
- You got a ton of kickbacks!

567
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,380
It's not true.

568
00:38:02,019 --> 00:38:03,219
What I said earlier...

569
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:07,389
was just a mistake.

570
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:10,929
Your Honor.

571
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:13,059
We just witnessed...

572
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:16,769
that Mr. Han Tae Kyeong might have
committed a crime in the past.

573
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:21,800
Also, his statements
don't seem consistent,

574
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,769
so it's highly likely
that he's not being truthful.

575
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:30,780
I'd like to question
the next witness, Your Honor.

576
00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:32,920
Witness,
proceed to the witness stand.

577
00:38:36,389 --> 00:38:37,389
Witness.

578
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:40,420
I heard you mentioned
that there's something...

579
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,030
you must tell all of us here in
this courtroom regarding the case.

580
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,559
I...

581
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:48,630
took care of the murder
of the Thai acupressurist.

582
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,130
You took care of it?

583
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:53,300
Are you saying...

584
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,869
that you killed the acupressurist?

585
00:38:55,869 --> 00:38:57,769
Yes, that's correct.

586
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:04,510
As far as I know,

587
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:09,090
you have nothing to do
with the acupressurist.

588
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,590
Then...

589
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:13,190
why did you kill her?

590
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:16,360
Because I was ordered to kill her.

591
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,329
Who gave you such an order?

592
00:39:31,539 --> 00:39:35,340
The defendant keeps claiming
that she never ordered the murder.

593
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:37,650
Then did someone else...

594
00:39:37,949 --> 00:39:40,849
order you to murder the victim?

595
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,789
Yes.

596
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,829
It looked like the defendant,
Nam Soon Ja,

597
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:54,000
was taking orders from someone
who's above her.

598
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:57,630
Who...

599
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,070
could that be?

600
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:06,940
The victim did say someone's name
as she was dying,

601
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,619
and it sounded like someone
who holds a high post.

602
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,989
But the thing is,

603
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:20,789
I don't really remember the name.

604
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:32,599
All right. Court Guard,
arrest the witness immediately.

605
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:35,099
He's under arrest for the murder
of the Thai acupressurist.

606
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:40,610
Prosecution,
please investigate who...

607
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,650
the accomplice he mentioned
could be.

608
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:43,980
Yes, Your Honor.

609
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,619
Court adjourned.

610
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,849
You guys are pretty good.

611
00:40:52,019 --> 00:40:56,289
You got rid of Han Tae Kyeong
and managed to manipulate Judge Cha.

612
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:58,260
I'm so relieved.

613
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,760
It's a bit earlier to be relieved.

614
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,800
The cards are still in play.

615
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,469
What? Cards?

616
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:10,110
The best card is for you
to mention Cha Moon Sook.

617
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:12,239
Take the stand at the next hearing.

618
00:41:12,579 --> 00:41:14,980
Say that Cha Moon Sook
put you up to it.

619
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:20,380
I can't decide on that just now.

620
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,550
Why not?

621
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:25,019
I need to make
some calculations of my own.

622
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,280
Bong Sang Pil and Ha Jae I...

623
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:49,550
have Cha Moon Sook cornered?

624
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,050
Yes.

625
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,679
Bong Sang Pil...

626
00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:00,460
What on earth is he planning?

627
00:42:16,869 --> 00:42:20,280
If things stay on track,
we have a fighting chance.

628
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,079
- But...
- You're right.

629
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,010
Nam Soon Ja's the problem.

630
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,079
We can't leave her as she is.

631
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,920
We need a backup plan.

632
00:42:32,019 --> 00:42:33,789
Her attitude has shifted.

633
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:36,829
An Oh Ju.

634
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:39,760
I need to know
if he has come to a decision.

635
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,699
Will you take him off
the wanted list?

636
00:42:43,429 --> 00:42:44,469
Yes.

637
00:42:44,469 --> 00:42:46,539
I'll talk to Prosecutor Cheon.

638
00:42:46,539 --> 00:42:48,940
It'll be better coming from me.

639
00:42:49,469 --> 00:42:50,969
Okay, thanks.

640
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,980
I need you to not take
public action against An Oh Ju.

641
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:00,349
What?

642
00:43:01,719 --> 00:43:04,590
You don't want me to prosecute him?

643
00:43:05,019 --> 00:43:06,119
Yes.

644
00:43:11,429 --> 00:43:13,800
That look tells me
you have a reason.

645
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:16,400
Am I right, prosecutor?

646
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,099
Before I give you the reason,

647
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,739
there's someone you should meet.

648
00:43:50,269 --> 00:43:55,539
She's the Thai masseuse who
worked at Cha Moon Sook's residence.

649
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:58,210
You must be surprised.

650
00:43:59,139 --> 00:44:02,010
Thank you for coming here.

651
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:04,250
There's one more thing
you should know.

652
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,579
She is...

653
00:44:10,449 --> 00:44:11,820
my mother.

654
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,489
Your mother?

655
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,360
18 years ago,

656
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:20,159
Cha Moon Sook almost killed me.

657
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,360
Sang Pil and Attorney Ha...

658
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:24,969
are the connections that...

659
00:44:25,769 --> 00:44:27,940
I told you about.

660
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,469
This is...

661
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:33,409
the reason I can give you.

662
00:44:44,949 --> 00:44:46,460
I'll take it from here.

663
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:53,730
There are no guards here.

664
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:57,530
Isn't she a cunning witch?

665
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,969
It could be a trap.

666
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,539
Shouldn't you just leave?

667
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:09,980
You stay here.

668
00:45:13,219 --> 00:45:16,719
Yell if something happens
and I'll come right over.

669
00:45:19,719 --> 00:45:21,760
My goodness, that scared me.

670
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:37,239
Come and sit down.
Let's talk face to face.

671
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:57,789
Say what you want to say.

672
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:00,199
Even if it's a threat.

673
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:11,139
Are you causing this fuss
because of Sang Pil's notebook?

674
00:46:14,309 --> 00:46:17,949
You should've trusted me, not him.

675
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:27,190
Forget about that.

676
00:46:29,659 --> 00:46:33,460
I'd like a reason
for me not to kill you.

677
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:39,739
Just one.

678
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:00,289
An Oh Ju.

679
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,690
Sang Pil thinks of you as an enemy
who killed his mother.

680
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:07,659
And yet you believe him
and try to attack me?

681
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:13,599
Think of when you worked for me.
This is nothing compared to that.

682
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:17,739
You'll end up...

683
00:47:19,409 --> 00:47:21,710
doing as I say.

684
00:47:22,809 --> 00:47:24,849
That's how you've lived.

685
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:27,579
That is your life.

686

(Cha Moon Sook
Expected to Pass Hearing)

687
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,750
I warned you clearly...

688
00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:00,219
not to use me
in your plan for revenge.

689
00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:05,150
I have no intention of
playing along.

690
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:10,130
Are you saying you won't
drop the charges against An Oh Ju?

691
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:16,130
However,

692
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,840
one thing bothers me.

693
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:24,369
The video that I used to charge him.

694
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:27,079
It might have gotten me there,

695
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:30,449
but once in court,
it could've backfired against me.

696
00:48:30,579 --> 00:48:34,079
Because it was taken without consent
in a forceful situation.

697
00:48:34,219 --> 00:48:38,519
It's true that I charged An Oh Ju
in a hurry with evidence...

698
00:48:38,889 --> 00:48:41,260
that wouldn't hold
and that hurts my pride.

699
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:43,929
That's why...

700
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:47,730
I'll prosecute him myself.

701
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,530
I'll find concrete evidence,

702
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:53,000
not use what's on the internet.

703
00:48:58,639 --> 00:48:59,739
Prosecutor.

704
00:49:01,909 --> 00:49:05,449
This trial is very important to me.

705
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:08,250
Thank you.

706
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:11,090
That's your problem.

707
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:38,579
An Oh Ju, it's me.

708
00:49:41,449 --> 00:49:42,849
I did what I said I'd do.

709
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:44,989
Did you really?

710
00:49:47,489 --> 00:49:51,989
Bong Sang Pil, you're so determined
to get your own way this time.

711
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:53,360
It's your turn.

712
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:55,760
If you want to live,
you'll have to make a decision.

713
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,539
What did Bong Sang Pil say?

714
00:50:04,539 --> 00:50:08,039
He says he'll remove
the bell on my neck.

715
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:09,849
The bell?

716
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,719
Did he remove your name
from the wanted list?

717
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:16,079
Why?

718
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:19,190
It won't take long to figure it out.

719
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:21,789
I'll find it out
once I appear in court.

You're here.

723
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,500
You look as though
you didn't sleep a wink.

724
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:04,099
What's wrong with your tie?

725
00:51:06,199 --> 00:51:08,639
Look at your face. You look tired.

726
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:10,239
My gosh.

727
00:51:10,409 --> 00:51:12,510
We've come at the wrong time.

728
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:13,739
We'll come later.

They're the type to keep going
even when we're here.

730
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:22,079
It's good to have someone around you
when you have a hard time.

731
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,650
Right. I wouldn't have been able to
come this far without Attorney Ha.

732
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:26,860
Me neither.

733
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:30,989
All right. We'll see you later.

734
00:51:30,989 --> 00:51:31,989
Bye.

735
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:34,730
What's wrong with the door?

736
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:40,840
Go, go! Get to your work!

737
00:51:41,639 --> 00:51:43,269
- Just go.
- Okay.

738
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:50,579
Right. Prosecutor Cheon
came to see me last night.

739
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:52,349
Really? How did it go?

740
00:51:52,449 --> 00:51:55,449
An Oh Ju is free now.

741
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:57,019
It's a temporary thing though.

742
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:58,820
Do you think he'll appear in court?

743
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:01,719

00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:13,070
has become the talk of the town...

such an enthusiastic response?

No, not at all.

750

I didn't expect people...

751

to listen carefully to my story.

752
00:52:31,349 --> 00:52:34,889
I've received
more than what I deserve.

I'm just grateful for that.

I just retraced
the course of my life...

I like it when you're
honest like that.

I wasn't honest before.

Hey, Cheon Seung Beom.

769

What do you think this is?

770
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:49,300
What? A disposition
not to institute a public action?

771

Why would you knock over
the table I set like that?

That's the result of much
thoughtful consideration.

from indictment as a prosecutor?

775

An Oh Ju's suspicion
of instigating murder...

776
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,550
is not being pursued
due to the lack of evidence.

a corroborative investigation.

the source of the material?

You jerk.

Are you saying
the materials are fake?

before the investigation.

from anyone.

take a look at this.

All I need to do now...

809

is attend the hearing
and answer your harsh questions.

810

It says your property is
600,000 dollars. Is that true?

00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:06,070
But I don't even own
a house in Kiseong.

816
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:11,710
I'm renting a house
owned by the foundation.

817
00:56:17,449 --> 00:56:20,280
By the way, what if...

818
00:56:20,449 --> 00:56:23,420
they ask you about
the photo from 18 years ago?

819
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:24,489
What would you tell them?

820
00:56:24,489 --> 00:56:27,820
Congressman Park, why would
you bring that up now?

821
00:56:29,289 --> 00:56:30,389
Congressman Park.

822
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:37,769
I've been plagued by the photo.

823
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:39,929
I believe you all know that.

824
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:41,000
We do.

825
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:43,909
The people were more upset
than I was...

826
00:56:43,909 --> 00:56:46,570
with the unproven case.

827
00:56:49,179 --> 00:56:51,110
I'm just grateful.

828
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:54,119
You just can't pull the wool
over the public's eyes now.

829
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:55,579
May I propose a toast?

830
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:56,679
Let's just drink.

831
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:58,250
Have some.

832
00:56:58,250 --> 00:56:59,250
Thank you.

833
00:57:13,969 --> 00:57:17,469
You should've trusted me
instead of Bong Sang Pil.

834
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:20,710
To Bong Sang Pil,
you're just...

835
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:23,780
an enemy who killed
his mother.

836
00:57:24,349 --> 00:57:25,409
You'll eventually...

837
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:28,519
do as I command.

838
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:30,820
You've spent
your whole life that way.

839
00:57:33,559 --> 00:57:35,889
Boss, we're all set
to go to court.

840
00:57:35,889 --> 00:57:37,460
We can leave now.

841
00:57:38,829 --> 00:57:41,630
The judge is entering. All rise.

842
00:57:41,699 --> 00:57:42,699
(The third trial for confining...)

843
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:44,170
(and soliciting to murder
a Thai acupressurist)

844
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:50,510
Please be seated.

845
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:58,550
We'll now begin the third trial.

846
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:03,320
Your Honor.

847
00:58:04,849 --> 00:58:08,559
The defendant, Nam Soon Ja
would like to make a testimony.

848
00:58:09,659 --> 00:58:10,989
Is she allowed to do so?

849
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:21,239
Yes. Let her give testimony.

850
00:58:34,449 --> 00:58:35,820
I'll tell you one thing.

851
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:39,449
Do you think Cha Moon Sook
will keep her promise?

852
00:58:39,789 --> 00:58:40,820
What do you mean?

853
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:42,320
Cha Moon Sook.

854
00:58:42,889 --> 00:58:45,489
She will never protect
you or your mother.

855
00:58:46,289 --> 00:58:48,199
She'll only use you two again.

856
00:58:49,099 --> 00:58:51,599
Don't be fooled by her, Yeon Hee.

857
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:13,920
Go ahead.

858
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:22,030
Will you
continue to protect Yeon Hee?

859
00:59:22,429 --> 00:59:24,630
I'm not saying this
because she's your daughter.

860
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:27,900
I believe in her talent.

861
00:59:28,739 --> 00:59:31,909
So think of her
when you make your choice.

862
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:35,139
Choose correctly,

863
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,579
and I will forever be in your debt.

864
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:45,190
You must think wisely.

865
00:59:46,690 --> 00:59:49,460
The moment you confess
and take the blame for her,

866
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:50,789
this trial will be over.

867
00:59:53,130 --> 00:59:54,230
The Thai...

868
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:56,929
acupressurist.

869
01:00:00,539 --> 01:00:01,570
It was me who...

870
01:00:08,909 --> 01:00:10,110
Mom?

871
01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:14,219
- Ms. Nam!
- Mom!

872
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:15,980
Security!

873
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:17,849
Help!

874
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:19,320
What's going on?

875
01:00:19,789 --> 01:00:20,860
- Move.
- Mom?

876
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:22,690
Mom, wake up.

877
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:24,429
She's out cold.

878
01:00:24,429 --> 01:00:25,960
- Ms. Nam.
- Call an ambulance.

879
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:28,099
- Ms. Nam.
- Guys, hurry up!

880
01:00:28,099 --> 01:00:29,130
Gosh.

881
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:39,309
Have a medical team check her.
We'll take a short recess.

882
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:43,639
Bong Sang Pil.

883
01:00:45,449 --> 01:00:47,579
I've changed my mind.

884
01:00:48,119 --> 01:00:49,219
An Oh Ju!

885
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:51,750
You're on your own now.

886
01:00:52,289 --> 01:00:53,519
Good luck.

887
01:01:03,699 --> 01:01:06,030
Attorney Bong, what is it?

888
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:08,269
An Oh Ju changed his mind.

889
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:10,909
He's not testifying?

890
01:01:12,809 --> 01:01:14,440
I should meet him in person.

891
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:16,739
I'm leaving the trial to you.

892
01:01:17,409 --> 01:01:20,179
Sang Pil, you get him back here.

893
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:21,519
Make him testify in court.

894
01:01:24,949 --> 01:01:27,019
Secretary Kim has found us a ship.

895
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,420
Don't forget our money.

896
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:30,829
Of course not.

897
01:01:32,659 --> 01:01:35,500
The APB has only been
lifted off for you and me,

898
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:37,329
so what about Secretary Kim?

899
01:01:37,329 --> 01:01:39,070
Hi, Secretary Kim!

900
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:41,639
Thanks to Sang Pil,
we don't have to smuggle...

901
01:01:41,639 --> 01:01:43,239
ourselves out of the country.

902
01:01:43,570 --> 01:01:44,670
You know Boss,

903
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:48,309
we shouldn't come back
to this darn country ever again.

904
01:01:56,579 --> 01:01:57,889
Was it Cha Moon Sook?

905
01:02:06,929 --> 01:02:08,460
Remove it, Secretary Kim.

906
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:12,699
Remove it!

907
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:17,000
I'm sorry about this.

908
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:20,809
You scum!

909
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:22,780
Don't you dare!

910
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:40,659
An Oh Ju. An Oh Ju!

911
01:02:44,329 --> 01:02:46,000
Oh, gosh.

912
01:02:46,769 --> 01:02:48,039
Now that hurts.

913
01:02:49,469 --> 01:02:52,440
You weasel, who ordered this?

914
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:51,030
Couldn't you come a little sooner?

915
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:57,139
Darn it.

916
01:03:58,070 --> 01:04:01,780
I should've never
gotten involved with you.

917
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:06,650
Anyway,

918
01:04:08,119 --> 01:04:09,920
I hope you make it out alive.

919
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:43,920
(Judge Cha Moon Sook)

920
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:11,679
(Lawless Lawfirm)

921
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:14,619
Nothing stands in
Cha Moon Sook's way now.

922
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:16,050
I don't trust Nam Soon Ja.

923
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,250
My best option...

924
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:20,619
is to incapacitate
Nam Soon Ja and An Oh Ju.

925
01:05:20,619 --> 01:05:22,159
Let me ask the defendant.

926
01:05:22,159 --> 01:05:23,590
Did you order the murder?

927
01:05:24,059 --> 01:05:26,190
Yes, I did.

928
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:28,500
I was the former mayor of the city.

929
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:30,829
Could I at least get one last smoke?

930
01:05:30,929 --> 01:05:32,269
He fled while in transit.

931
01:05:32,269 --> 01:05:33,500
What's his game plan?

932
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,139
I have an idea.

933
01:05:35,469 --> 01:05:37,340
Your Honor,

934
01:05:37,570 --> 01:05:39,510
there's one
important question left.
