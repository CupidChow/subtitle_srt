1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,139
(Lawless Lawyer)

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,150
(Lee Joon Gi)

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,980
(Seo Yea Ji)

4
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:17,859
(Lee Hye Young)

5
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,899
(Choi Min Su)

6
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:29,969
(Lawless Lawyer)

7
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:34,509
Nice to meet you.
I'm Attorney Bong Sang Pil.

8
00:00:36,109 --> 00:00:37,240
What?

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,310
Who's that?

10
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,679
What is he doing here?

11
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:42,079
This is the broker
who set the hitman up...

12
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,450
with the very person who solicited
to murder Mayor Lee Young Soo.

13
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,289
- What?
- Really?

14
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,289
Let's go, Judge Cha.

15
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,630
Seriously?

16
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,759
Who on earth is that man?

17
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:07,739
I'm sorry about earlier,

18
00:01:08,209 --> 00:01:09,569
Judge Cha Moon Sook.

19
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,150
I don't remember inviting you today.

20
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:23,219
The star of a party
is always the unwelcomed guest.

21
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:30,159
Why did you ruin
my father's unveiling party?

22
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:32,359
I know you want to destroy
Wu Hyung Man with the trial...

23
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,370
and make An Oh Ju
the mayor with your power.

24
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:37,599
But it will never happen.

25
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,909
Are you trying
to frame me or something?

26
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,939
As long as I get to stand
before the court,

27
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:45,879
innocent people won't be murdered...

28
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:47,810
by law anymore.

29
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,280
Okay.

30
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,620
You took after...

31
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,489
Jin Ae a lot.

32
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:57,790
You're bold and reckless.

33
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,859
Don't ever...

34
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,260
talk about my mother again.

35
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,400
Do you think...

36
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,830
you're the first one...

37
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,770
to come to see me like this?

38
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:14,370
I will...

39
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:17,439
show you the end of it.

40
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,780
For the first time.

41
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,900
That lunatic!

42
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:47,370
He must be completely
out of his mind.

43
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,039
How can he ruin
such an important event?

44
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:53,409
Yes, then I'll interrogate
the broker first.

45
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,250
Okay.

46
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,650
Prosecutor Kang.

47
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,090
We're ready to start
the interrogation.

48
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:04,460
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- It's okay.

49
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:08,830
Yeon Hee.
Try to make Judge Cha feel better.

50
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,629
That jerk.

51
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,849
Well...

52
00:03:35,689 --> 00:03:38,319
The broker won't say anything...

53
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,490
that could cause problems for us.

54
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,000
So many hitmen,
whom you don't even know,

55
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,900
shut their mouths for good
in the past.

56
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,870
From their eyes and nostrils
to their ears,

57
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,639
they voluntarily closed
all the holes in their bodies...

58
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:57,710
and jumped into water
or onto train tracks...

59
00:03:57,979 --> 00:03:59,580
and ended up in the other world.

60
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,650
All of them jumped to death
voluntarily.

61
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:05,979
That's because you're lucky.

62
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,490
I'm sure you've already heard,

63
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:13,120
but I know why that jerk,
Bong Sang Pil, showed up.

64
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:16,259
He wants to track down
those who killed his mom.

65
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:19,129
He obviously wants
to get revenge on them.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,529
He sure is Jin Ae's son.

67
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,769
He became a lawyer and showed up.

68
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:27,139
He came at me so recklessly,
so I wondered who he could be,

69
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:28,910
and it turns out...

70
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,279
He wants to take revenge for his
mother's death from 18 years ago.

71
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:36,949
What a filial son.

72
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,449
Everyone feels the same way
about their parents.

73
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,089
Don't belittle such sentiments.

74
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,790
My gosh, Judge Cha.

75
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,860
You're incredibly understanding
toward lowly people like us.

76
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,069
What's that called? You're like
Guan Yin, the Goddess of Mercy.

77
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,230
I saw...

78
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:59,399
your father's statue
in court earlier.

79
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:04,279
It looked just like him
when he was alive.

80
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:06,810
For a moment, I thought
he came back to life.

81
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,550
I think...

82
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,279
I should take you...

83
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,550
to a very special place today.

84
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,290
Please allow me.

85
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:21,490
I must take you there
on a day like today.

86
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,300
Yes, I think it's my duty.

87
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:29,300
- My gosh, Attorney Bong!
- Enough. Stop it, guys.

88
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,540
You're incredibly gutsy and brave.

89
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:33,709
Against that powerful judge,
Cha Moon Sook...

90
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:37,379
- You were like this!
- Like this!

91
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,910
That was amazing.

92
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,379
Stop overreacting.

93
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,449
That was nothing for him.

94
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:45,649
That was the most thrilling
moment in my life so far.

95
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,620
What a dynamic adventure!

96
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,189
Don't get too excited.

97
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,720
That could get us in trouble.

98
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:53,120
- I'll go talk with Jae I.
- That judge learned her lesson.

99
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,529
Oh, where are you going, Boss?

100
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:55,629
- We wanted to...
- Guys!

101
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,430
Let's order fried chicken and beer.

102
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,300
- Fried chicken and beer!
- Fried chicken and beer!

103
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:05,970
I thought you were after An Oh Ju
to prove Wu Hyung Man's innocence.

104
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:08,939
But why is your target...

105
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,980
Judge Cha now, not An Oh Ju?

106
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:23,990
Judge Cha's father, Cha Byung Ho.

107
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:27,629
He worked as a judge for 37 years
in Kiseong.

108
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:30,800
He used the law
in whichever way he wanted.

109
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,399
He was like an all-powerful king.

110
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,399
Her father's money, power,

111
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:40,199
and the complete trust
of people of Kiseong...

112
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,009
were all inherited to her.

113
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:46,180
Like you said,
Judge Cha has everything.

114
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:48,649
Why would she want to make
a man like An Oh Ju the mayor?

115
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:53,680
To have more.

116
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,459
And An Oh Ju is gladly...

117
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,389
getting blood on his hands for her.

118
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,259
Are you expecting me to believe
that theory of yours?

119
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,800
Not believing it...

120
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:07,529
doesn't change the truth, Jae I.

121
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,970
After you.

122
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,949
Your father and I...

123
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,379
ate very often here.

124
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,220
To me, this place
means a lot more...

125
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,889
than home.

126
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,089
This chair. He always sat here.

127
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,899
My father liked sundaeguk?

128
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:43,529
I'm surprised.

129
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,800
He ate the soup on its own,

130
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:49,470
and the same goes for rice.

131
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,839
He always ate them separately.

132
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:56,310
He was such a noble person,
you know.

133
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,420
He always ate very neatly.

134
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:01,189
You probably have...

135
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:03,920
more memories with him than I do.

136
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:06,389
No, that's not true. Not at all.

137
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:10,490
You're his daughter,
and I was just his loyal servant.

138
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:12,860
You see,

139
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,800
I just faithfully obeyed his orders,

140
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,800
that's all.

141
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,009
"Oh Ju."

142
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,350
"Will you be able to do it?"

143
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,319
He asked me that question
so many times.

144
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,149
And every time he asked
that question to me, I never,

145
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,360
not even once,

146
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,789
said I couldn't do it.

147
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:48,500
In this country,

148
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:51,899
money and law
can make anything possible.

149
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,909
As you know,

150
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:56,409
I have money. Aren't I right?

151
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:00,039
And you know
how to use the law, so...

152
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,320
How impudent.

153
00:09:07,419 --> 00:09:09,820
How dare you use my father...

154
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,320
to try to instigate me?

155
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:17,259
You try to eat with me
on the same table?

156
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,399
You should be licking
the liquor spilt on the table.

157
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:23,970
You're just an object
I inherited from my father.

158
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:28,210
What are you thinking? You probably
feel like you have Kiseong...

159
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,539
in the palm of your hand now that
you're going to run for mayor.

160
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,320
I...

161
00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:48,629
forgot my place...

162
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,830
for a moment.

163
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,029
Judge Cha, please...

164
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,769
kindly forgive me...

165
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,370
just this once.

166
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:03,039
Did you just ask me to forgive you?

167
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:07,279
The only person I can forgive...

168
00:10:07,909 --> 00:10:09,350
in the entire world...

169
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,250
is myself.

170
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,360
When are you
planning on telling her?

171
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,460
She's so loyal to Cha Moon Sook,
not knowing what she did to her mom.

172
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,299
Seeing that makes me wonder...

173
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:28,429
if I should tell her.

174
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:31,700
She needs to see
Cha Moon Sook's true colors first.

175
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,139
Without that,

176
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,269
she won't believe me.

177
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:37,710
That won't be easy.

178
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,210
She's like a mother to her.

179
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,710
She'd abandon
either Cha Moon Sook or me.

180
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,350
She'd choose between the two.

181
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:49,590
I thought that Ms. Ha...

182
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:52,860
was just a part of your revenge.

183
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,659
But now, I think she's...

184
00:10:55,629 --> 00:10:57,090
more like the last piece
of the puzzle...

185
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,330
that completes
your plan for revenge.

186
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,309
(Missing Person)

187
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:18,679
Mom.

188
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,789
Mom.

189
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,860
Mom.

190
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,059
Mom.

191
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,559
Mom.

192
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,899
- Mom.
- Jae I.

193
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,330
Mom.

194
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,309
Jae I.

195
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,639
Jae I. Why are you here?

196
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:49,750
My mom. Help me find my mom.

197
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:53,919
She took a lot of photos here.

198
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:03,730
Jae I.

199
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,769
I will find your mom for you.

200
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,970
Don't worry.

201
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:10,529
Okay?

202
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,710
- You're here.
- Hey.

203
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:16,940
What did you get?

204
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:18,379
I bought some groceries.

205
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,210
What will you cook?

206
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:22,309
Jae I.

207
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,649
Shall we talk?

208
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:27,789
Oh dear. What do you want to say?

209
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,789
- Jae I.
- Yes?

210
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,519
That law firm.

211
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:35,230
You should quit.

212
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:36,960
What do you mean?

213
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,600
If you're working there
to protect this studio,

214
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:43,470
I'd rather close this place down.

215
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,940
- What?
- The deposit will cover the debt.

216
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,870
Don't work with Bong Sang Pil.

217
00:12:50,309 --> 00:12:51,309
Dad.

218
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,639
It was an important day.

219
00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:57,450
It meant so much to Judge Cha.

220
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:00,019
But he made a mess.

221
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:02,549
You know that...

222
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:04,720
if she hadn't found you,

223
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,830
if I'd lost you after
I'd lost your mom...

224
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,730
I'd have died a long time ago.

225
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,570
We have to be good to Judge Cha.

226
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:20,039
We must stay away from those...

227
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,210
who cause trouble to Judge Cha.

228
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:23,809
Okay?

229
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:36,320
Judge Cha, Attorney Ha's here.

230
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,620
(Kiseong District Court)

231
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,330
If you're busy,
I'll come back later.

232
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:51,000
It's fine, you're a special guest.

233
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,639
I can't send you away.

234
00:13:57,509 --> 00:13:58,879
Why won't you ask anything?

235
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:01,250
I'm pretty sure you're here...

236
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:04,350
for a very clear reason.

237
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,490
Is everything true about what
you said with Bong Sang Pil?

238
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,559
That's what you're here to ask.

239
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,230
Yes.

240
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,490
Jae I.

241
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:20,600
Do you think that
punishing someone...

242
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,799
according to the law...

243
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,440
is a privilege?

244
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,019
People don't think about
the crimes they committed...

245
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:42,690
and blame me, the judge.

246
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,990
I'm surrounded by enemies.

247
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,929
The more people I sentence,

248
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,360
the more enemies I make.

249
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:58,139
Punishing someone with the law...

250
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,710
is not a privilege to me.

251
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:04,309
It's more like a penalty.

252
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:06,779
Judge Cha.

253
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:09,610
I'm sure that is...

254
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,879
what fuels Bong Sang Pil.

255
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:16,850
Because of a sentence
I don't remember giving,

256
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:18,320
he hates me...

257
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:21,230
and decided to be my enemy.

258
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:26,259
(Attorney Bong)

259
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,509
Jae I.

260
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,980
How much do you think
you know about Bong Sang Pil?

261
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:45,220
Lend me your newspaper.

262
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,279
Pay for it. It doesn't cost much.

263
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,360
- Hello.
- Hi.

264
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,820
(Cha Byung Ho Statue Unveiled)

265
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,529
Cha Byung Ho's statue...

266
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:58,100
was unveiled at
Kiseong Court yesterday.

267
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,330
People say the ceremony
was more solemn...

268
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,200
than any before.

269
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,299
Cha Byung Ho was one of
Kiseong's eminent judges,

270
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,940
famous for his strict
and fair rulings...

271
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,240
"More solemn than any before"?

272
00:16:12,509 --> 00:16:14,779
The unveiling of his statue...

273
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:18,519
urged legal professionals
to think about justice...

274
00:16:21,789 --> 00:16:23,649
My goodness, ma'am.

275
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,360
You always give me too much.

276
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,259
What do you live off of?

277
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:33,429
Stop being silly and eat up.

278
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,029
You need to get out there...

279
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:38,600
and revive our economy.

280
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,340
Like you saved your company.

281
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,240
An Oh Ju, the son of Kiseong.

282
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,379
Day and night,
he thinks about the city.

283
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,450
Do you want more rice?

284
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,350
The best city in Korea to live in.

285
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,919
The most upright and righteous city.

286
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:59,590
An Oh Ju will create that city.

287
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,590
Candidate 8, An Oh Ju.

288
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,090
Applause.

289
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:08,829
Candidate 8, give me a hug.

290
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,339
- An Oh Ju.
- An Oh Ju.

291
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,210
- An Oh Ju. An Oh Ju.
- Come on.

292
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,069
- Get back to work.
- Get going.

293
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,839
Hey, you.

294
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,549
You're pretty good.

295
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:26,380
I hired people to
write things online.

296
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,190
They'll start rumors,

297
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,450
spread gossip that must be spread,

298
00:17:30,589 --> 00:17:32,960
and cover up things
that work against you.

299
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,630
I hired exactly 100 part-timers,

300
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,529
so they're called The Hundred.

301
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,859
Don't hire part-timers.

302
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,029
Make them full-timers.

303
00:17:42,369 --> 00:17:45,700
Give them insurance
and a severance pay too.

304
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,910
Guarantee them a decent pay package.

305
00:17:49,509 --> 00:17:51,880
That way they'll work
wholeheartedly.

306
00:17:53,509 --> 00:17:57,309
You're a real businessman.
You're so generous.

307
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,490
How dare you come here?

308
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:06,890
What are you doing here?

309
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:08,890
Are you campaigning for him?

310
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,759
I'm the chief organizer
of the campaign.

311
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,000
This must be a comedy show.

312
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,869
He hired someone like you?

313
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:19,200
My goodness, Mr. Bong.

314
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,640
We might become friends
if we keep meeting like this.

315
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:29,009
So,

316
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,319
the broker you brought over.

317
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:33,920
It's all fine.

318
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:38,789
It would've been nicer
if you'd chosen another location.

319
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,130
Today...

320
00:18:42,859 --> 00:18:44,500
I came to give you this.

321
00:18:46,829 --> 00:18:48,369
What's that?

322
00:18:48,569 --> 00:18:53,039
The phone of the hit-man
who killed Mayor Lee Young Soo.

323
00:18:53,769 --> 00:18:54,839
An Oh Ju...

324
00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:57,009
told me to kill the mayor.

325
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,480
I showed up with
the broker yesterday.

326
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,420
I expected it to be on the news.

327
00:19:05,619 --> 00:19:08,250
Is this how visitors
are treated in Kiseong?

328
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:15,730
You ruined everyone's party
and soured everyone's mood.

329
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,400
Why are you so shameless?

330
00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:21,170
You must be curious
to see what's inside.

331
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:22,670
Have a look.

332
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,269
What will I find in an empty shell?

333
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:28,410
I won't find a single cent.

334
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,410
Will I, Gwan Dong?

335
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:31,710
No, sir.

336
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:35,680
It belonged to a dead man,
so deal with it appropriately.

337
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,769
(Myungshin Law Firm)

338
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,940
Do you know he has
a criminal record?

339
00:20:04,009 --> 00:20:05,009
What?

340
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:07,339
I didn't.

341
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:12,019
He seemed to know a lot about you...

342
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:13,950
but you don't know anything.

343
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,420
It's my fault.

344
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,359
I should've told you sooner.

345
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:25,200
One of my juniors owns a law firm.

346
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,230
I got you a job.

347
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:29,829
Call when you're ready.

348
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,440
I don't like seeing you
work with a man...

349
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,380
who's hostile towards me.

350
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:55,359
Where were you? You ignored my call.

351
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:03,430
Without our paralegal at her desk,

352
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,470
the law firm hasn't
been functioning properly.

353
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,769
I'm not your secretary.

354
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:11,069
Who did you meet with
to develop this tone with me?

355
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:17,849
No personal conversations.

356
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:19,549
Got it.

357
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:23,250
Then let me brief you
on where we're at with our trial.

358
00:21:23,789 --> 00:21:28,660
Only two hearings remain until
the trial of Mayor Lee's death.

359
00:21:29,529 --> 00:21:31,559
We handed over the broker
connecting An Oh Ju to the hitman...

360
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:33,130
to Prosecutor Kang,

361
00:21:33,529 --> 00:21:36,769
but we can't just sit around
watch it play out.

362
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,670
You want the broker to
name An Oh Ju at the hearing.

363
00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:41,769
Yes.

364
00:21:41,769 --> 00:21:42,769
Okay.

365
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:50,910
In what world do you think
he'll mention An Oh Ju?

366
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,750
We must make it happen.

367
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:55,549
We'll pull it out from him
if we have to.

368
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,960
Do you recognize this man?

369
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,730
He's the broker we saw
with An Oh Ju's secretary.

370
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,730
He was questioned before me.

371
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:10,930
For what crime?

372
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,339
He's a repeat offender
of criminal use of drug.

373
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:17,069
He got off scot-free though.

374
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,410
Tell me everything about him...

375
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:20,940
from his underwear size
to his associates.

376
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,210
Any weak spots?

377
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,210
His life can't get any worse.

378
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,950
People like him
don't have weak spots...

379
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,289
because they have
nothing more to lose.

380
00:22:28,289 --> 00:22:30,220
Everyone in this world
has something to lose.

381
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:33,789
We all have someone
we wish to protect...

382
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:36,630
in our hearts.

383
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,339
(4th hearing of
Mayor Lee Young Soo murder)

384
00:23:08,059 --> 00:23:09,089
What's going on?

385
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,529
Wasn't that broker indicted?

386
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:15,000
He's here as
a witness for the prosecution.

387
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,299
The prosecution's witness?

388
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,900
He's not a suspect, but a witness?

389
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:22,569
That's right.

390
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,180
What can he possibly say to help...

391
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,809
the prosecution's case?

392
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:31,650
Wait. Did you already know
about this?

393
00:23:34,849 --> 00:23:37,349
So how's the hearing going?

394
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,319
The broker is at the court.

395
00:23:39,589 --> 00:23:42,029
That's not what is important here.

396
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:44,630
- Which side called him?
- The prosecution, sir.

397
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:47,259
Nothing's going to happen...

398
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,799
if he keeps his mouth shut
on the stand.

399
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:51,029
I made sure that'll happen.

400
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:54,000
Goodness.
You pulled out all the stops.

401
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,440
Won't you regret that tone
when I actually win this election?

402
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,380
Even if you become the president,

403
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,009
I wouldn't be fazed.

404
00:24:01,009 --> 00:24:03,549
I know very well that...

405
00:24:03,549 --> 00:24:06,980
all you care about is
Judge Cha and Prosecutor Kang.

406
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,319
I'm actually here
to talk about that.

407
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:13,519
I don't want you anywhere
near my daughter.

408
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,430
Even I can't look at her
without being blinded by her light.

409
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:18,630
Got it?

410
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,170
I see you're a mother too...

411
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,170
when it comes to your own.

412
00:24:33,109 --> 00:24:36,450
Do you know Jo Beom Jin,
also known as the hitman?

413
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,450
I don't.

414
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,180
Are you sure?

415
00:24:45,589 --> 00:24:46,720
I see.

416
00:24:50,259 --> 00:24:52,460
Did you hire Jo Beom Jin...

417
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:55,470
to murder Mayor Lee Young Soo?

418
00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:00,339
I didn't. I did no such thing.

419
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:04,069
My bad. I made a mistake.

420
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:07,680
Let me rephrase.

421
00:25:08,349 --> 00:25:11,450
I forgot that you're
actually a known broker.

422
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:15,990
Did someone hire you
to connect him or her...

423
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:18,220
to hitman Jo Beom Jin?

424
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,359
Attorney Bong...

425
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:22,359
was at the scene of
Jo Beom Jin's death.

426
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,029
He's delaying this court...

427
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,759
with groundless suspicion.

428
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:30,200
Sustained. The defense attorney
will only ask necessary questions.

429
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,210
Escort her.

430
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:52,059
You're an acclaimed broker
of the underground scene.

431
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,890
However, your rap sheet is clean.

432
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,029
Yes, that's right.

433
00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:02,930
That means you're good at your job
or you leave no loose ends.

434
00:26:03,369 --> 00:26:05,740
- Is that correct?
- Don't answer that.

435
00:26:05,869 --> 00:26:06,869
Your Honor...

436
00:26:10,509 --> 00:26:11,509
Attorney Bong,

437
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:14,710
please return to your seat
if you have no more questions.

438
00:26:16,779 --> 00:26:18,549
To reveal
the true nature of this trial,

439
00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:20,450
I will only ask one more question.

440
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,119
Four years ago,
you were almost indicted...

441
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:27,589
for criminal use
and possession of drugs.

442
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,859
- How did you get out of it?
- Witness,

443
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:32,130
you don't have to answer.

444
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,430
Attorney Bong, return to your seat.

445
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:36,329
You committed crimes...

446
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:38,769
4 years ago, 7 years ago,
and many other countless times.

447
00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:42,440
Are you at peace with your mother
knowing all the details?

448
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,569
Objection!

449
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:46,039
The defense attorney
is asking unrelated questions...

450
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:48,650
to throw this whole court off.

451
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:50,309
I'm giving you a warning.

452
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:51,309
(Oh, you're helping someone.)

453
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:52,380
Answer me.

454
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,049
Who did you connect the hitman with?

455
00:26:55,049 --> 00:26:57,220
- Your Honor.
- Attorney Bong, I warned you.

456
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,460
You listen to me.

457
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,259
You may be a witness now,

458
00:27:03,259 --> 00:27:05,460
but you'll be in
the suspect's seat next.

459
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,359
That seat right there.

460
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,930
The defense attorney will
return to his seat!

461
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,809
I heard your mother is
suffering from a heart disease.

462
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:19,539
Do you want to become a criminal
in front of her?

463
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:22,079
Attorney Bong, I warned you.

464
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:24,109
I hold you in contempt of court.

465
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:26,180
Tell me who gave the order.

466
00:27:27,619 --> 00:27:28,950
Tell me now.

467
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:31,420
Attorney Bong, I warned you.

468
00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:33,059
I'll answer.

469
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:34,990
You don't have to.

470
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:50,009
I...

471
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:57,579
introduced the hitman
to someone for a fee.

472
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,549
That someone...

473
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:05,960
is the secretary.

474
00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:13,130
Whose secretary
are you talking about?

475
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:21,470
Chairman An Oh Ju.

476
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,180
I didn't know he'd kill Mayor Lee.

477
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:27,309
I really didn't know.

478
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:29,809
I did wrong, and I'm so sorry.

479
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:34,420
That'll be all, Your Honor.

480
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:39,420
I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry.

481
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:41,930
(Defense Attorney, Defendant)

482
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,670
I'll deliver the final decree
at the next hearing.

483
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:56,210
Even someone like a broker wants
to be a good son to his mother.

484
00:28:56,509 --> 00:28:58,880
We all have someone
we want to protect.

485
00:28:59,809 --> 00:29:02,210
I don't want to chase him
in front of his mother.

486
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,180
We'll wait until they part.

487
00:29:04,579 --> 00:29:05,619
Yes, sir.

488
00:29:10,089 --> 00:29:11,920
I couldn't protect my mom.

489
00:29:24,269 --> 00:29:25,799
What happened again?

490
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,670
My name...

491
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,910
was mentioned during the hearing.

492
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:33,539
Bong Sang Pil, that little weasel.

493
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:35,579
He's splashing filth my way.

494
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:37,349
I'm sorry, sir.

495

you'll make sure
you're never spotted.

498
00:29:46,859 --> 00:29:48,759
Go somewhere far...

499
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:50,430
and stay hidden.

500
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:52,430

discreetly take care of him.

You idiot.

505
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:12,079
What's important right now...

506
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:16,089
isn't gutting Bong Sang Pil.

507
00:30:16,089 --> 00:30:18,660
Me being elected
as mayor matters more.

508

Yes, sir!

Bring it here.

516

Put it away now.

517
00:30:43,849 --> 00:30:45,079
You have few left.

- Do you like it?

Do you think she'll let us
prove my innocence?

She's trying to kill me

Why are you bringing up
Judge Cha Moon Sook...

00:31:02,769 --> 00:31:03,829
Hey.

527
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:06,640
Cha Moon Sook and An Oh Ju are

That was good.

Were you born with
that fighting spirit, Attorney Bong?

535

I must say, your plan succeeded.

536
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:32,859
You've managed to grab my attention.

537
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:35,289
That wasn't my goal,

538
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:37,789
but I'm glad to know I've managed
to grab my enemy's attention.

539

But...

540
00:32:40,099 --> 00:32:42,730
were you not able to arrest
Chairman An's secretary?

541
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:44,400
Or is it just not on the news?

542
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,200
We're trying to track him down
at the moment.

543
00:32:46,369 --> 00:32:47,700
So he's gone off the grid.

544
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:50,339
I wonder who gave him
the information.

545
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,140
Someone must've told him.

546
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,279
Otherwise, he wouldn't have been
able to run away so quickly.

547
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:56,309
Are you suspecting
that someone in my team did it?

548

Or are you...

suspecting me,

Not you, of course.

I know that you're not
like your mother.

Mr. Bong Sang Pil.

553
00:33:06,259 --> 00:33:08,059
What are you trying to achieve
through the trial?

554
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:09,529
You'll be disappointed
if I tell you.

555

Unlike you, I'm not fighting
for a just cause.

556
00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:17,500
Whether it's for justice
or out of your sense of duty,

557
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:20,769
the one who uncovers the truth
will win.

558

Even if that involves
losing the trial, that is.

Before the last hearing,

560
00:33:27,509 --> 00:33:29,079
I'd like to promise you two things.

561
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:31,049
First.

562
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:34,250
I'll make sure I get
Wu Hyung Man acquitted.

563
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,390
Then what's...

564
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,950
the other one?

565
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:39,619
I'll let you protect justice...

566
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,690
even if you lose the trial.

567
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:52,400
Hey, did you come alone today?
Where's Bong Sang Pil?

568
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,539
I'm not here because of the trial.

569
00:33:57,539 --> 00:34:00,839
Then why are you here? It's not like
we have other things to talk about.

570
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:10,119
Please tell me...

571
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,960
what you know
about Judge Cha Moon Sook.

572
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,300
Please.

573
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,199
You know...

574
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:28,170
that I worked with An Oh Ju
for a long time, right?

575
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:30,239
Yes, I'm aware.

576
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:33,909
There was someone
who always gave him orders.

577
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:38,949
But he never revealed
the mastermind behind him.

578
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,449
Are you saying it's Judge Cha?

579
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:45,519
Come to think of it,

580
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:49,690
Cha Moon Sook is the only person
who can be above An Oh Ju...

in the entire City of Kiseong.

582
00:34:56,869 --> 00:35:00,039
It was a lawyer's office
even back in the days.

583
00:35:00,539 --> 00:35:02,039
That was many years ago.

584
00:35:02,869 --> 00:35:05,010
A female lawyer used
the office space by herself.

585
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,210
I think she had a son.

586
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:12,480
But then, she took her own life.

587
00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:14,780
And her son went missing after that.

588
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,789
I see. Thank you.

589
00:35:19,789 --> 00:35:22,019
No problem. Come back anytime
if you have other questions.

590

- Got it, sir.
- Wait, hold on.

593
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,570

- Hello.

596
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:39,840
You moved here from Seoul
with Attorney Bong, right?

597
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,980
Yes.

598
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,849
Why did you guys
decide to move to Kiseong?

599
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,610
Attorney Bong was doing well
for himself in Seoul.

600
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,219
That's...

601
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,050
Did you know Bong Sang Pil
before he moved here?

602
00:35:51,989 --> 00:35:55,590
No, I met them the first day
they arrived. It was fate.

603
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:59,300
Otherwise,
how could he have found...

604
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,559
a loan shark like me?

605
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,699
Attorney Bong found you?

606
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,539
Well, not exactly.
He came to this office and met me.

607
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:09,110
But it's the same thing.

608
00:36:09,969 --> 00:36:12,309
He kept saying that he has to get
this office space...

609
00:36:12,309 --> 00:36:14,610
Hey, enough. Get back to cleaning.

610
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:16,880
Go over there and clean the desk.

611
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,679
- Make it very clean.
- Okay.

612
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:21,019
Clean thoroughly.

I'm...

makes me uncomfortable.

There's no reason why the food
truck owner would commit suicide.

644
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,840
It's certainly not because of money.

645
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,880
He has no debt at all.

646
00:38:31,179 --> 00:38:33,449

649

and they said
they never sent anything like that.

650
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,159
What's wrong with you, seriously?

651
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:44,030
Then there must've been another
reason why he had to commit suicide.

652
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,599
We must re-investigate it. There are
so many things that seem odd.

For goodness' sake.

00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:57,469
Detective Oh.

657
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,840
Hello.

658
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:12,719
This is what you asked for.

659
00:39:12,889 --> 00:39:15,590
But why are you digging this up?
Because of your mom?

660
00:39:16,829 --> 00:39:19,260
No, there's just something
that I'm curious about.

661
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,769
I was in charge of this case.

662
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,469
The suicide of Lawyer Choi Jin Ae.

663
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,670
Really, Detective?

664
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,940
She was such a great lawyer.

665
00:39:30,269 --> 00:39:32,239
The best lawyer I've ever seen.

666
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,610
My mother was a lawyer too,

667
00:39:35,909 --> 00:39:37,210
like Attorney Ha.

668
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:40,150
I must say,
she raised her son very well.

669
00:39:40,949 --> 00:39:43,619
She was very different from me
as a lawyer.

670
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,619
I still have a long way to go
to become like her.

671
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:51,489
(Choi Jin Ae Suicide Case Report)

672
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,559
Thank goodness I made a copy
of the report.

673
00:39:55,969 --> 00:39:57,730
As soon as the case was closed,

674
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:00,940
The original file disappeared.

675
00:40:01,769 --> 00:40:03,110
It disappeared?

676
00:40:03,469 --> 00:40:06,210
I think there's
something more to this case.

677
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:10,949
Do you think
it might not be a suicide?

678
00:40:10,949 --> 00:40:13,320
That's what my gut tells me and...

679
00:40:14,019 --> 00:40:15,420
Attorney Choi...

680
00:40:16,349 --> 00:40:19,860
She was not the kind of person
to abandon her young son like that.

681
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,860
He was a really smart kid.

682
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,130
I still think of him.

683
00:40:32,769 --> 00:40:35,440
You look terrible.

684
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,809
Is prison life tough?

685
00:40:38,809 --> 00:40:40,280
You jerk.

686
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:43,150
I will kill you.

687
00:40:44,349 --> 00:40:46,679
Let's be gentlemen, shall we?

688
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,480
To kill me,

689
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:50,420
you need to get out first.

690
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:53,690
Bong Sang Pil said he'd get you out.

691
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:55,929
What did I do wrong?

692
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:58,730
- What?
- Knowing too much...

693
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:02,230
about my dirty past is your crime.

694
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,469
Trusting you...

695
00:41:04,469 --> 00:41:06,500
and opening up to you was my crime.

696
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,869
You scumbag.

697
00:41:07,969 --> 00:41:11,269
- You...
- Come on, sit back down.

698
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,380
Be a gentleman.

699
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,380
You know,

700
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,949
covering up a crime is...

701
00:41:18,179 --> 00:41:20,480
hundreds of times harder than...

702
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,989
committing one.

703
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:27,320
Power is what makes it possible
to do something that hard.

704
00:41:28,289 --> 00:41:31,829
And I have that power.

705
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:36,099
Bong Sang Pil wants
revenge against those...

706
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,000
who killed his mom.

707
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,070
You and I are two of them.

708
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,070
Do you want to...

709
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:46,539
put him in charge of your life?

710
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:49,250
I can't believe I'm hearing you...

711
00:41:49,409 --> 00:41:51,849
of all people say that.

712
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:56,789
He at least said he'd get me out.

713
00:41:57,219 --> 00:41:59,889
He said he'll kill me
after taking me out.

714
00:42:00,289 --> 00:42:02,590
Fine. Forget about it all.

715
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,389
Have a look at this.

716
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,010
This is...

717
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,480
Where did you get this?

718
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,519
That's it.

719
00:42:29,489 --> 00:42:31,219
That look I see now...

720
00:42:31,219 --> 00:42:35,420
is the look you used to have
when you looked at me.

721
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,489
Give me that.

722
00:42:37,829 --> 00:42:39,030
Give me that.

723
00:42:39,699 --> 00:42:40,699
Friend.

724
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:42,869
Your only way out...

725
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:44,969
is in my hands.

726
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,170
Let's survive.

727
00:42:51,139 --> 00:42:53,380
You and me both.

728
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:59,349
I didn't think your secretary
would be mentioned in court.

729
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:02,420
That wouldn't have happened
if I'd been in charge.

730
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:05,920
Then you should've done
your job right in the first place.

731
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,559
I can always make up for it now.

732
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,130
You'd better do that.

733
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,369
It's me, darling.

734
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:21,199
Are you okay?

735
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:24,369
When this trial's over,

736
00:43:24,369 --> 00:43:27,079
I'll be a free man, so until then...

737
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:30,280
Chairman An paid
the medical bills...

738
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:32,949
that were in arrears.

739
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:37,489
He's been...

740
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:40,690
- visiting me regularly.
- What?

741
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:43,929
Honey.

742
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:45,789
I...

743
00:43:46,659 --> 00:43:47,659
Darling.

744
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:50,429
Darling, what's wrong?

745
00:43:50,429 --> 00:43:52,900
- Doctor, she passed out.
- Honey.

746
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,440
Honey, are you okay? Honey.

747
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,510
5205, your attorney's here.

748
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:15,289
Sir, 5205 refused to see you.

749
00:44:26,969 --> 00:44:28,869
Do you like paintings?

750
00:44:30,309 --> 00:44:31,840
I used to be a thug,

751
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,440
but I love paintings like these.

752
00:44:35,809 --> 00:44:39,449
Everyone wishes to
live for a long time.

753
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:42,349
Ever since Bong Sang Pil
became your legal consultant,

754
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:45,750
you've been accomplishing
everything you wanted to.

755
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,030
In a seemingly legal manner
from the outside.

756
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:56,230
Ms. Attorney.

757
00:44:57,329 --> 00:44:59,699
You definitely aren't here
for the paintings.

758
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,309
12 criminal records.

759
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:10,349
The boss of Dae Woong Gang,
the largest gang in north Seoul.

760
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:13,949
Out of the five major crimes, you
didn't commit murder or robbery,

761
00:45:14,449 --> 00:45:17,190
but you have
an affinity for violence.

762
00:45:20,219 --> 00:45:23,289
You brought a full resume
so I can't deny anything.

763
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,460
So,

764
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:29,869
why are you here to see me?

765
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,070
Bong Sang Pil worked for you
as part of your gang.

766
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,769
Why did he suddenly move to Kiseong?

767
00:45:39,309 --> 00:45:42,710
Did you give him an order?

768
00:45:42,909 --> 00:45:44,349
An order?

769
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:52,449
It seems that you came here
not knowing our relationship.

770
00:45:53,389 --> 00:45:55,289
What do I not know?

771
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,929
Do you know this, then?

772
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:01,460
His mom, Attorney Choi Jin Ae.

773
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:04,969
She's not on the family registry,
but she was my sister.

774
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:10,110
Sang Pil's my nephew.

775
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:13,809
He's the only relative I have.

776
00:46:15,179 --> 00:46:19,050
Sang Pil's return to Kiseong,
her mother's hometown and...

777
00:46:20,179 --> 00:46:22,449
where his mother died,
was purely his decision.

778
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:26,260
He risked his life on it.

779
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:30,690
Do you think it's a coincidence
that you met Sang Pil as soon as...

780
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:33,460
you went back to Kiseong?

781
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:36,800
What do you mean?

782
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:41,869
Don't you think the timing's
too crazy to be a coincidence?

783
00:46:45,139 --> 00:46:46,480
If it's not a coincidence, then...

784
00:46:47,409 --> 00:46:49,210
What else would it be, then?

785
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,110
Hi, uncle.

786
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:23,079
She came over, like you said.

787
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:24,980
Sang Pil.

788
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:29,050
Don't trust anyone,
especially over there.

789
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:31,750
I've watched her for a long time.

790
00:47:34,289 --> 00:47:35,460
I trust her.

791
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:36,889
Okay, then.

792
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:39,260
Stay safe, both of you.

(Civil Rights Lawyer
Commits Suicide)

794
00:47:57,579 --> 00:47:58,650
You fool.

795
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,389
Run.

796
00:48:04,219 --> 00:48:05,320
Go!

797
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:13,960
Did you call the police?

798
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,699
I told you not to.

799
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:22,739
Let's stay far away
until it dies down.

800
00:48:31,579 --> 00:48:33,920
The day you came over,
I told you, didn't I?

801
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:36,050
Yes.

802
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:39,289
Not to get revenge.

803
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:41,719
Yes.

804
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,800
A man should cry
when others aren't looking.

805
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:01,239
You won't get it now, Sang Pil,

806
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:05,050
but in this cursed world,

807
00:49:06,849 --> 00:49:09,849
law betrays you and so do people.

808
00:49:10,889 --> 00:49:11,889
Revenge...

809
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:15,460
only calls for more revenge.

810
00:49:45,989 --> 00:49:49,760
My gosh, Attorney Bong Sang Pil.

811
00:49:50,989 --> 00:49:52,860
Are you working at this late hour?

812
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,969
What are you doing here?

813
00:49:57,469 --> 00:50:00,070
I came here for a reason.

814
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:01,699
I wouldn't come for no reason.

815
00:50:04,769 --> 00:50:05,840
All right.

816
00:50:07,739 --> 00:50:10,780
So this was your mom's office?

817
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:13,480
You have a good memory.

818
00:50:14,349 --> 00:50:16,320
I knew it.

819
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:20,260
I thought the address
seemed somewhat familiar.

820
00:50:21,989 --> 00:50:25,289
The criminal always returns
to the scene of the crime.

821
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:27,300
Just like this.

822
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,860
Did you...

823
00:50:29,699 --> 00:50:33,099
not get sick after eating it?

824
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,309
You've been...

825
00:50:38,139 --> 00:50:39,909
somewhat extraordinary
since you were a kid.

826
00:50:41,809 --> 00:50:42,809
You know?

827
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,480
Do you remember?

828
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:48,050
This.

829
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:51,949
You were squeezed in the cabinet.

830
00:50:53,219 --> 00:50:56,690
You were hiding in there...

831
00:50:57,789 --> 00:50:59,929
holding your breath.

832
00:51:03,329 --> 00:51:05,530
Gosh, stop it.

833
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:08,570
Just stay seated. I'm scared.

834
00:51:09,769 --> 00:51:10,940
You know...

835
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:14,039
that I killed your mother.

836
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:16,579
An Oh Ju.

837
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:28,420
Hey. Wait.

838
00:51:29,889 --> 00:51:32,559
I can just kill you right here now.

839
00:51:33,929 --> 00:51:35,599
Just like you killed my mother.

840
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,699
You want to take...

841
00:51:38,469 --> 00:51:40,340
revenge on me with the law, right?

842
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:43,409
That's why you became
an attorney and came to Kiseong.

843
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:47,510
Gosh, let go of me.

844
00:51:47,809 --> 00:51:50,510
Let's talk like gentlemen.

845
00:51:51,849 --> 00:51:54,050
You have law,

846
00:51:54,449 --> 00:51:57,550
and I have money, you know?

847
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:00,190
Oh, right.

848
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:02,320
I also...

849
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:04,289
have law.

850
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:06,860
I have Judge Cha Moon Sook with me.

851
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:27,719
Gosh, what's wrong with you.

852
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:32,719
Now that you saved my life,

853
00:52:34,119 --> 00:52:35,989
I'll never forget your kindness.

854
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:41,630
I'll see you
on my home ground next time.

855
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:46,739
Oh, that's right.

856
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:50,139
You should go to Wu Hyung Man.

857
00:52:51,309 --> 00:52:54,079
He might have a change of heart.

858
00:53:57,710 --> 00:53:58,909
Where's the judge?

859
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:02,909
You can't get in here
without my permission.

860
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:06,849
I'm too old to get your permission.

861
00:54:06,849 --> 00:54:09,679
Chairman An, let's be frank.

862
00:54:10,119 --> 00:54:12,719
We are not in the same rank.

863
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,460
I was born with a silver spoon
in my mouth.

864
00:54:16,789 --> 00:54:19,690
And you were a servant
who reeked of fish.

865
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,429
We can't be the same.

866
00:54:21,429 --> 00:54:24,929
You must've been dying
to say it the whole time.

867
00:54:25,269 --> 00:54:27,639
You and I were the same...

868
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:30,840
that we both are servants
of this family.

869
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,639
My gosh, are we the same?

870
00:54:33,639 --> 00:54:35,639
I'm running for mayor now.

871
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:39,780
So we will end up...

872
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,650
in the same rank soon.

873
00:54:41,719 --> 00:54:42,780
What did you say?

874
00:54:44,019 --> 00:54:46,250
Now that you have some money,

875
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:48,659
you want an important title.

876
00:54:48,659 --> 00:54:51,530
Gosh, you've changed a lot.

877
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:53,530
Don't worry about me.

878
00:54:54,659 --> 00:54:56,559
Now that I think of
a political career,

879
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:59,800
you'd think I'm a grasping
social climber or something.

880
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,099
But I'm doing this...

881
00:55:03,269 --> 00:55:06,309
to make more money.

882
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:10,880
There's nothing more important
than money for me in this world.

883
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,380
That's where we're the same.

884
00:55:13,579 --> 00:55:15,880
Except for that, we're
not the same at all.

885
00:55:19,389 --> 00:55:21,719
Oh, she's new.

886
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:25,860
You can't just let anyone in here
like this.

887
00:55:26,059 --> 00:55:30,300
You'll be in trouble
if you bring in anyone.

888
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:31,570
Don't worry.

889
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:33,539
She's a naive blind woman.

890
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:37,110
What are you doing?

891
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,210
Just go.

892
00:55:42,579 --> 00:55:44,510
You can't trust me?

893
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:10,170
You try to lay your hands
on everything.

894
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:12,639
Then why did you let
the trial go like that?

895
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:15,639
If the fact that they got
the secretary's name...

896
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:18,179
creates grounds for a crime,

897
00:56:19,349 --> 00:56:21,619
then it wouldn't be your courtroom.

898
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:24,719
You can cover up my sin.

899
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:27,820
That's your real power.

900
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:32,489
People are not stupid.
Don't be mistaken.

901
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:35,130
Of course, I know that.

902
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,739
Actually that's why
I'm walking on eggshells.

903
00:56:41,969 --> 00:56:46,170
The Internet, social media,
and all that.

904
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:48,340
And there's no one...

905
00:56:49,179 --> 00:56:51,949
who'd refuse to take money.

906
00:56:51,949 --> 00:56:53,619
That's one thing
that's never changed.

907
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:55,820
The same applies to you.

908
00:56:57,190 --> 00:56:58,219
Right.

909
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:01,820
You can't say that
people are all the same.

910
00:57:03,059 --> 00:57:04,289
That's very offensive.

911
00:57:06,289 --> 00:57:07,300
I'm sorry.

(Always push forward)

913
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:58,309
I heard you got suspended
for punching a judge.

914
00:57:58,309 --> 00:57:59,809
How did you know that?

915
00:58:01,219 --> 00:58:02,519
Did you do a background check on me?

916
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:03,750
If she gets...

917
00:58:05,349 --> 00:58:07,690
a single scratch
anywhere on her body,

918
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,559
I'll kill you.

919
00:58:11,559 --> 00:58:14,130
That's enough.
Sang Pil, stop!

920

921
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:17,730
Oh, I was just...

922
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:21,170
thinking that's what
your mother looks like.

923
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,869
Have you thought deeply
about Judge Cha?

924
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:26,570
Judge Cha...

925
00:58:27,079 --> 00:58:28,980
is like my mother in my heart.

926
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:30,039
I know that.

927
00:58:35,219 --> 00:58:37,449
But my mom told me...

928
00:58:37,619 --> 00:58:39,920
not to come back to Kiseong.

929
00:58:41,889 --> 00:58:43,590
I have something to do here.

930
00:59:12,449 --> 00:59:13,519
Wait.

931
00:59:13,789 --> 00:59:15,090
I thought you went home already.

932
00:59:19,659 --> 00:59:21,659
Why are you working late
when I didn't even ask you to?

933
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,159
It's not like you.

934
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,429
I got curious about this place.

935
00:59:31,639 --> 00:59:33,739
You suddenly developed
love for your workplace.

936
00:59:34,739 --> 00:59:36,210
I guess I was like that too.

937
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:39,409
I wanted to clean
and dust the office...

938
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:41,949
and clear my desk
before the hearing.

939

This office, I mean.
