(Episode 9)

8
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,340
Put your hands up.

9
00:00:36,109 --> 00:00:38,539
I'm warning you. Raise your hands!

10
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,780
Bong Sang Pil, that idiot.

11
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,619
- Throw it there.
- Sure thing.

12
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:53,320
Hey. Hey!

13
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,929
You're under arrest for murder.

14
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:04,640
You have the right
to have an attorney...

15
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,040
and the right to defend yourself.

16
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,209
At a redevelopment area in Kiseong,

17
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:15,010
a grotesque murder has occurred.

18
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:18,049
At an abandoned building
in Chilhyeon-dong of Kiseong,

19
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,349
a nephew stabbed his uncle...

20
00:01:20,349 --> 00:01:24,319
and then dropped him
from the roof ending his life.

21
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:28,989
Attorney Bong, the suspect,
is an ex-convict...

22
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:31,900
and is a known member of...

23
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,469
the deceased's gang
known as the Dae Woong Gang.

24
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,299
Judge Cha,
Bong Sang Pil has been arrested!

25
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,109
I see you're already
watching it on the news.

26
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:42,810
It's nothing to fuss about.

27
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,180
It only adds to
the shocking nature of the crime.

28
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,109
Doesn't it appear
to be An Oh Ju's doing?

29
00:01:54,019 --> 00:01:56,390
Did you know about this in advance?

30
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,459
Gosh, forgive me.

31
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,390
I'm only worried that
this might backfire on you.

32
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,310
Judge Cha, I'm sure you heard
about Bong Sang Pil's arrest.

33
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:22,250
Meet me at my residence now.

34
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:38,800
Things seem to be going
exactly the way you want,

35
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,900
- but you don't look satisfied.
- What?

36
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,439
Good job today.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,740
You finally
earned your keep around here.

38
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,340
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

39
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:55,949
Choi Dae Woong...
I honestly wouldn't have minded...

40
00:02:55,949 --> 00:02:57,620
a friend like him.

41
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,120
It's too bad.

42
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:03,960
Do you know that thing
people lay out at funerals?

43
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,159
- Yes, I do.
- Make sure to send one of those.

44
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,490
Yes, sir.

45
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,099
Hello?

46
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:13,229
Mayor An,

47
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:17,740
Judge Cha is in
an extremely bad mood.

48
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,840
So, I heard.

49
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,539
Was it you who got on her nerves?

50
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:25,379
We're not the heroes here,
just sidekicks.

51
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,349
Why don't you know your place?

52
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,879
You do remember what you said to me?

53
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:32,250
Whatever.

54
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,289
Just cut to the chase already.

55
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:36,819
Do you not get what I'm saying?

56
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,189
Get over here immediately.

57
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,430
Mr. Tae, I'll head over
to Attorney Bong.

58
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,569
I'll come with you.

59
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:49,169
Geum Kang,
call if something happens.

60
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:50,169
Sure thing.

61
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:51,439
Hold on!

62
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,610
They're making their way up here.

63
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,979
- Who are?
- I think they're cops.

64
00:03:56,979 --> 00:03:58,979
They're heading up here with boxes.

65
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:00,039
- What?
- Darn.

66
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,819
Detective Gong.

67
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,650
Following the murder
of Choi Dae Woong,

68
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:08,650
we have a warrant to
search and seizure Lawless Law Firm.

69
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,860
Touch anything in this office,
and I'll make you pay!

70
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,189
Arrest them all!

71
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,000
If anyone impedes
this investigation,

72
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:20,230
arrest all of them.

73
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,029
Attorney Bong didn't do it.

74
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,800
You know that
very well yourself, sir.

75
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,069
Attorney Ha.

76
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:28,870
I'm a prosecutor,
not Bong Sang Pil's friend.

77
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,339
We'll investigate and find out
whether he's really guilty or not.

78
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,649
Please begin the search and seizure.

79
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:37,779
- Let's get started.
- Let's go.

80
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:40,279
I knew he'd get himself
in trouble but murder?

81
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:44,290
What do you think you're doing now?

82
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,230
Don't jump to conclusions,
Kang Yeon Hee.

83
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:50,899
He was caught red-handed
on the scene.

84
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:53,560
I'm not jumping to conclusions.
It's just how the situation is now.

85
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:56,970
As a prosecutor, you'll regret
saying what you just said.

86
00:04:57,069 --> 00:04:58,800
If we find any evidence here,

87
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,339
we'll have to interview you
as a witness. You know that, right?

88
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:10,550
Fine, go ahead
and interview me all you want...

89
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:11,949
if you need me.

90
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,189
We don't have much time.
We should go and see Sang Pil.

91
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,339
You must stay calm and collected
at times like this.

92
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,370
You're the only one
who can help him now.

93
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:38,939
I know. I got worked up like that
intentionally.

94
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,079
The trial began
the second he got arrested.

95
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:45,850
I showed them that we feel
he's being falsely accused...

96
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,319
because I'm Sang Pil's attorney.

97
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:50,860
What is it?

98
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:52,360
An anesthetic, sir.

99
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,399
Let's wrap it up.

100
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:00,970
Hey, Geum Kang.

101
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,500
Attorney Ha, we have a big problem.

102
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,970
- They found a box I've never seen,
- Geum Kang.

103
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,970
and there was an anesthetic in it.
Wait, just a moment.

104
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:08,439
An anesthetic?

105
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:10,170
- I'm being arrested now.
- Geum Kang. My gosh.

106
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,980
We don't have important roles here.

107
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,379
- He really doesn't know anything.
- Yes.

108
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:15,250
- Attorney Ha.
- Gosh, these two are so loud.

109
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,310
- It's not that.
- Don't worry.

110
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,879
They're not arresting you.
They're taking you as a witness.

111
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,519
Just tell them what you know.

112
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,589
I'll head back
as soon as I see Attorney Bong.

113
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,759
Now, we know for certain
that he's caught in a trap.

114
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,860
Jae I.

115
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,699
You went alone...

116
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:13,569
and this happened.
Are you happy about that?

117
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:17,980
Is this what you wanted?

118
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,550
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,290
I...

120
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,019
have a favor to ask.

121
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:37,029
Take care of my uncle's funeral...

122
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,600
for me.

123
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,779
No.

124
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:52,839
You'll be...

125
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:57,079
able to do it yourself...

126
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:01,089
because I'll make it happen
no matter what.

127
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,879
It looks like Mayor An has forgotten
about the days when he was a nobody.

128
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,509
I mean, look at what he did
to Bong Sang Pil.

129
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:28,949
Who made him the mayor of this city?

130
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:33,750
I know that he talked back to you
even back in the days,

131
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,789
but how shall I put it?

132
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:36,990
Shall I say,
he's even more obnoxious now?

133
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:41,090
Anyhow, I'm pretty sure
my instincts are accurate.

134
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:46,600
If you find out anything
unusual, report to me right away.

135
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:48,429
Yes, ma'am.

136
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:54,570
- I told you that we know nothing.
- That's right.

137
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,240
You two must've coordinated
your stories before coming here.

138
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:59,639
How can you two know nothing?

139
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,509
Let me explain, Detective.

140
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:05,620
All right.
This guy here was born that way.

141
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,450
He just doesn't know anything.

142
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:11,159
As for me, I know other things,
but nothing about this case.

143
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,620
In other words, we're not the same.
But neither of us knows anything.

144
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,759
- Hey!
- Hey!

145
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:18,129
It's not like I can lie
to the detective here.

146
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,870
- Aren't I right? What do you know?
- You wench.

147
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,570
- Hey, be quiet.
- Sorry.

148
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,340
Then why was an anesthetic
found in the office?

149
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,870
- That's what I'm saying.
- We don't know.

150
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,139
It's Bong Sang Pil's, right?

151
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:30,740
- How would we know?
- What?

152
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,740
Do you know what will happen to you
if you don't tell us the truth?

153
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,320
They're here as witnesses.
If you treat them like suspects,

154
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,179
we'll have to file a complaint
to the Human Rights Commission.

155
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,919
- Attorney Ha.
- Human Rights Commission, yes.

156
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:46,590
Mister, you heard
what our attorney just said, right?

157
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,830
Goodness gracious.

158
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:52,299
Please refrain from things like that
as they can be perceived as threats.

159
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:55,899
I think we were as cooperative
as we could be today.

160
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,399
Get up. Let's go.

161
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,139
Mister, Attorney Bong
didn't do anything wrong. Gosh.

162
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,980
I'll let you go today.

163
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,679
But since you also work
for Lawless Law Firm,

164
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:10,450
we'll need your interview
soon as well.

165
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,350
Let's eat, guys.
We haven't eaten all day.

166
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,990
We can't work if we don't eat.

167
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:55,590
I never felt that way when I used to
have to go to police stations often,

168
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:58,200
but with Attorney Ha there today,

169
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,929
I felt so proud and supported.

170
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,830
Hey, Attorney Bong
has been arrested.

171
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,399
How can you talk about
such things now?

172
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:10,610
Why aren't you guys eating? Eat up.

173
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:13,039
- Yes, let's eat.
- Yes, enjoy.

174
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:17,850
Sang Pil
must be utterly devastated now.

175
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,889
His uncle was like a father to him.

176
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:27,529
He taught him to never hurt anyone
in this tough, cutthroat business.

177
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,960
He practically raised Sang Pil.

178
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:34,600
- Kwang Soo, you should eat first.
- Yes, you should.

179
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,769
Eat up.

180
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:40,370
By the way,

181
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:43,139
why do you think an anesthetic
was found in this office?

182
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:45,639
- I feel wrongly accused.
- I know. It's strange, isn't it?

183
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,250
- Guys.
- Yes?

184
00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:52,350
Yang Don. Where did Yang Don go?

185
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,419
I know, right?
I haven't seen him for a few days.

186
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,950
- The thing is...
- Yes.

187
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,820
He's gone off the grid.

188
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,519
What do you mean?

189
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,659
It looks like he canceled
his phone service and ran away.

190
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,899
Hey, you should've managed
the guys under you better!

191
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:11,940
I found out about this just now.
Who are you to lecture me?

192
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,500
Don't worry too much.

193
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,740
The trial hasn't even begun yet.

194
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,840
Let's eat. Sit down.

195
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,980
- Okay.
- Let's eat, guys.

196
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,450
- Okay.
- Okay.

197
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,450
I'm sorry.

198
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:25,149
- Come on. Eat up.
- Okay.

199
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:37,899
My gosh, Judge Cha.

200
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:41,799
My feelings are hurt.

201
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:47,139
How can you celebrate alone
with this wine?

202
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:52,110
Could I have a glass too?

203
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,149
Come on, let me have a glass.

204
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,419
It's nothing difficult.

205
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,330
You know what?

206
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,570
When a hound bites someone...

207
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:17,029
without the owner's permission,

208
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,539
the hound gets euthanized.

209
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,940
The same goes for you.
Bark and bite...

210
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:26,080
only when I tell you to do so
because you're my dog.

211
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,480
Got it, ma'am.

212
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,059
But you see, Judge Cha...

213
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,990
Judge Cha.

214
00:13:43,629 --> 00:13:45,529
I'm doing all of this...

215
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:51,539
to help you bury your past
as your loyal dog.

216
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,840
Why can't you see it?

217
00:13:58,409 --> 00:13:59,580
Why?

218
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,320
(Attorney Bong Sang Pil)

219
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:17,590
I thought you had it with me.
What brings you back?

220
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,590
I'll be defending Bong Sang Pil.

221
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,330
Of course. I expected you to.

222
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,299
You didn't come here
to say that though.

223
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:29,799
I have a favor to ask.

224
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:31,299
A favor?

225
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:33,340
That's interesting.

226
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:38,080
Let Attorney Bong
coordinate his uncle's funeral.

227
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,820
Because of some worthless thug,
you're here bowing down to me.

228
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:55,929
Bong Sang Pil is still a suspect.

229
00:15:57,129 --> 00:15:59,399
Only the chief prosecutor
can order his release.

230
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:01,730
You know that, so why come to me?

231
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,830
It's obvious that
he won't allow it,

232
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,299
which is why I came to you.

233
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,340
His last remaining family member
was murdered.

234
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,009
At least let him have
a proper goodbye.

235
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:16,710
What will I get in return
if I agree to this?

236
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,580
Name your price.

237
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:29,429
Clear Bong Sang Pil's name.

238
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:35,129
Jae I, show me how good
of a lawyer you are.

239
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:36,570
Win his case.

240
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:40,370
I'm sure you have a reason for this,

241
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,009
but my priority must be
Attorney Bong right now.

242
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:46,440
I'll look into your intentions
once the trial is over.

243
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:47,779
Sure.

244
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:52,279
I'll be the presiding judge,
so impress me in person.

245
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:57,720
Chief Prosecutor Jang,
have Bong Sang Pil released.

246
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,700
Thank you for coming.

247
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:19,079
You have some nerve coming
when Boss died on your watch.

248
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:20,279
Sir.

249
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,380
- Sir!
- Sir!

250
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,109
What do you think you're doing?

251
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,519
It's all right, Attorney Ha.

252
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:26,880
Are you saying he's not at fault?

253
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,619
Attorney Bong was framed.
He was caught in a trap.

254
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:32,920
Shut up and bring me
the scum that killed Boss.

255
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:38,259
Attorney Bong!

256
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,740
You piece of scum.

257
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:47,099
How dare you kill Boss?

258
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:50,369
Do you suspect me too?

259
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,710
Shut it.

260
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,809
He's my uncle.

261
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,150
At least let me pay my respects.

262
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,150
Please.

263
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,130
You have 10 minutes.

264
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,279
Uncle.

265
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,890
Thank you for raising me.

266
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,819
Please rest in peace.

267
00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:03,509
Uncle, I'm so sorry.

268
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:35,309
Hold on.

269
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,930
Kwang Soo, listen to me carefully.

270
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,430
Things won't end
with just me behind bars...

271
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,329
so don't leave Attorney Ha's side.

272
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,700
I won't.

273
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,109
If she's about to do
something dangerous,

274
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:05,240
you must stop her.

275
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:06,809
Don't worry, sir.

276
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,579
- Don't worry, sir!
- Don't worry, sir!

277
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,759
You helped me say goodbye
to my uncle.

278
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,130
Thank you, Jae I.

279
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,700
Hang in there.

280
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,970
I'll soon clear your name.

281
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,400
Stay safe.

282
00:20:51,089 --> 00:20:52,089
Well,

283
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,220
let me ask you one thing.

284
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,660
You want to know
if I really killed my uncle.

285
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,630
I figured out the answer
back at the funeral home.

286
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,569
Are you perhaps
Attorney Choi Jin Ae's son?

287
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:11,210
He was a clever, little boy.

288
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:15,680
Yes, I am.

289
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:19,950
My mother is Attorney Choi Jin Ae.

290
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:23,849
Her case...

291
00:21:24,819 --> 00:21:26,720
still haunts you to this day,
doesn't it?

292
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,930
How could I ever forget it?

293
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,500
I'll ask one more.

294
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,230
You working with
Noh Hyun Joo's daughter, Ha Jae I...

295
00:21:37,569 --> 00:21:39,500
Is that just a coincidence?

296
00:21:40,339 --> 00:21:42,210
Don't tell me that...

297
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,680
someone of your caliber
believes in coincidences.

298
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,480
Right.

299
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:52,349
You recommending me
to Prosecutor Cheon...

300
00:21:52,819 --> 00:21:54,150
wasn't a coincidence either.

301
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,170
There you are.

302
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:10,529
How have you been?

303
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,569
Why not me...

304
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,509
but my uncle?

305
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,779
Curious, are we?

306
00:22:25,349 --> 00:22:26,450
Answer me.

307
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:30,549
Answer me.

308
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,490
Answer me, you piece of trash!

309
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:36,690
Bong Sang Pil,

310
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,130
you're the highlight
of this little show...

311
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,769
that comes at the end.

312
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,839
When I eat a meal,

313
00:22:46,369 --> 00:22:48,740
I always leave
the most delicious side dish...

314
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:51,579
to the very last moment.

315
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,309
I eat the other dishes one by one...

316
00:22:55,779 --> 00:22:57,210
and save that for the last.

317
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:05,690
Anyway,

318
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:09,630
if you wish your people no harm,

319
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:15,329
you'll rot in there
without even making...

320
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,369
a peep.

321
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:21,240
Got it?

322
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,920
Judge Cha told my attorney
to clear my name,

323
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,519
but you clearly want me dead.

324
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:40,819
It doesn't seem like
you two are on the same page.

325
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,900
What? Didn't you know...

326
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,170
that she told my attorney
to win my case?

327
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:02,210
No one can dare to understand
the depth of Judge Cha's words.

328
00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:05,750
Still, shouldn't you
at least be aware of it?

329
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,519
Shouldn't you? An Oh Ju!

330
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:50,059
Sang Pil, congratulations
on passing the bar.

331
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:52,759
For our beloved friend,
Bong Sang Pil, cheers!

332
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:54,099
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

333
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:58,369
Don't let being an attorney
get to your head.

334
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,569
Act like you're better than us,

335
00:25:00,569 --> 00:25:01,940
and you'll pay.

336
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,039
Sir, come on.

337
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,039
I'm an attorney who's
still a part of this gang.

338
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:07,410
No, don't you say that.

339
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,779
Boss wants you to leave...

340
00:25:10,779 --> 00:25:13,319
the gang life behind for good,

341
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:15,650
and I agree.

342
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:17,250
That's upsetting to hear.

343
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:19,490
What will you do about it though?

344
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:21,359
Anyway,

345
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:23,960
just don't live like us.

346
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,160
"Live like us?"

347
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,529
What's wrong with our lives?

348
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:28,329
Tell me!

349
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:31,670
Sirs, I love you both!

350
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,869
I love you too.

351
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:38,940
Inmate 6109, keep moving.

352
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,369
I feel safe having a bodyguard.

353
00:26:04,569 --> 00:26:06,539
My boss's orders are the law to me.

354
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,539
It's an abandoned building
ready for redevelopment.

355
00:26:14,109 --> 00:26:15,509
They chose it on purpose.

356
00:26:15,849 --> 00:26:17,809
There aren't any
security cameras nearby.

357
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,819
Let's look for another entrance.

358
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,519
- Let's check over there.
- Okay.

359
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,859
The scene has been cleaned
in record time.

360
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:33,500
I doubt we'll find any shoe prints.

361

363
00:27:19,109 --> 00:27:21,180
We finally have a witness.

364
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:24,910
Let's keep looking around.

365
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:31,759
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm good.

366
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:34,119
Hey!

367
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,470
Prosecutor Kang stopped by.

368
00:27:48,609 --> 00:27:49,970
Hello, Judge Cha.

369
00:27:50,109 --> 00:27:52,710
Can you beat Jae I in court?

370
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,980
The murder weapon with
Bong Sang Pil's prints was found.

371
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:59,619
You had more evidence
at Wu Hyung Man's trial too.

372
00:27:59,849 --> 00:28:01,220
Still, you lost.

373
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:04,250
Meanwhile,
Bong Sang Pil and Ha Jae I won.

374
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:08,829
That couldn't be
Prosecutor Kang's fault.

375
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,690
Mayor An...

376
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,259
I won't lose this time.

377
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:15,170
Of course not.
This time, Prosecutor Kang...

378
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,829
Soon Ja, please.

379
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:19,069
Who are you to butt in...

380
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,039
when we're talking about a case?

381
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,450
Leave my schedule open this weekend.

382
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:30,349
Yes, ma'am.

383
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:33,720
You must have something
important that day.

384
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,519
I want to go horseback riding.

385
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,019
Yes, ma'am.

386
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:46,930
Judge Cha told my attorney
to clear my name,

387
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,769
but you clearly want me dead.

388
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,799
You two aren't on the same page.

389
00:28:55,309 --> 00:28:57,140
What's odd...

390
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:00,579
is odd for a reason.

391
00:29:01,849 --> 00:29:03,650
- Don't you agree?
- Sorry?

392
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:05,849
Yes, of course.

393
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:08,950
Bong Sang Pil...

394
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:14,319
Something about him
just keeps bugging me.

395
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:19,460
Even a sturdy embankment...

396
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,730
may come down crumbling...

397
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,640
because of a tiny hole.

398
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:32,640
The hole in this case
seems a lot bigger,

399
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:36,109
but I just can't see it.

400
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:46,190
During the search and seizure
of the law firm,

401
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,490
an anesthetic was found.

402
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,390
An Oh Ju must've
planted it in advance.

403
00:29:51,529 --> 00:29:52,730
Is there a witness for the trial?

404
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:55,799
There was one in the vicinity
around the time of the incident.

405
00:29:56,529 --> 00:29:58,539
He'll testify for
the prosecution though.

406
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,099
It won't be in favor for me then.

407
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:03,869
I'll be prepared.

408
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:09,950
Whose phone call did you receive
before leaving that day?

409
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:12,480
Seok Gwan Dong called
from a burner phone.

410
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:15,220
We won't be able
to trace the number.

411
00:30:15,789 --> 00:30:16,849
Probably not.

412
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,589
There must be a hole in this trap,

413
00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:23,190
and that I'll find.

414
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:29,029
Also, I'm asking for
a trial by jury.

415
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,730
Is it because of Judge Cha?

416
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,039
Yes.

417
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,369
If the jury unanimously
finds you not guilty,

418
00:30:35,369 --> 00:30:38,740
Judge Cha will have no choice
but to consider them.

419
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,279
So...

420
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:43,680
don't you worry.

421
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:47,819
I'm not worried.

422
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:51,960
You...

423
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,690
shouldn't worry either.

424
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:57,029
As if that's possible.
How can I not?

while you're in here.

can never hold their heads up again.

00:34:52,059 --> 00:34:53,559
that I'm not the one who killed him.

488
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:54,929
What if you can't prove it?

489
00:34:57,269 --> 00:34:59,039
Then you'll die by my hands.

490
00:35:11,179 --> 00:35:14,480
("Weapon with Fingerprints of
the Thug-Turned-Attorney Found")

491
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,159
(Choi Dae Woong of Dae Woong Gang,
Attorney Bong Sang Pil)

492
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:37,710
If you show up again,

493
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,039
I'll kill your daughter first.

494
00:36:27,889 --> 00:36:29,389
Mom...

495
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,630
Mom...

496
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:02,059
I don't want to live
like that anymore.

497
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,860
Then what are you going to do?

498
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,900
Is there anything you can do?

499
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,079
I'll open a law firm in Kiseong.

500
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:22,880
Is it because of that girl?

501
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:24,780
Yes, Boss.

502
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,980
Who gave you that notebook?

503
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,289
From what I know, there's only
one person who'd send this to me.

504
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:45,500
You met Sang Pil
as soon as he moved to Kiseong.

505
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,340
Do you think it was a coincidence?

506
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,420
Oh, there she is.

507
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,590
Jae I!

508
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:08,090
My gosh. You look great,

509
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:11,329
but I don't love your outfit. I
should've put together one for you.

510
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:14,860
- Really? I've been too preoccupied.
- It's okay.

511
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:17,369
Who are you
to criticize Attorney Ha's outfit?

512
00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:20,800
Anyway, we just need to wait...

513
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,369
- for Sang Pil to get acquitted now.
- Exactly.

514
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:24,739
We'll be counting on you.

515
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:28,010
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay.

516
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:29,010
- All right.
- Yes.

517
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:32,309
Oh, aren't you Attorney Ha's father?

518
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:33,820
- Hello.
- Dad.

519
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,719
You must be here
to watch the trial today.

520
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,559
We'll head in first.

521
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:44,989
What? Have some manners.
We should go in together.

522
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,360
Gosh, you're so tactless.
Go in already.

523
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,960
No, it's okay.

524
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,400
We're all here to root for
my daughter. Let's go in together.

525
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,699
- Yes, sure thing.
- Oh, okay.

526
00:38:53,739 --> 00:38:57,340
You're finally back in court
as an attorney, but you look awful.

527
00:38:58,309 --> 00:38:59,739
Why? How do I look?

528
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:03,809
An attorney's attire
can help them with their pleading.

529
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:07,619
Here.

530
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:11,519
My gosh! You should definitely
change into this. This is so great.

531
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,730
I'm not here
to root for Bong Sang Pil.

532
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:18,590
Then why are you here?

533
00:39:18,929 --> 00:39:21,400
I'm here as a fan
of Attorney Ha Jae I.

534
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,099
You got me there.

535
00:39:43,449 --> 00:39:45,150
Bong Sang Pil. I must say,

536
00:39:46,989 --> 00:39:49,389
being in court as a defendant suits
you better than being an attorney.

537
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:52,699
Being framed and ending up
in this prisoner's uniform...

538
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,329
is more honorable than being
hypocritical in that judicial robe.

539
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:01,300
You'll have to wear this uniform
yourself very soon, Judge Cha.

540
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:06,940
Didn't you tell me
that you won't let the law...

541
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:08,940
kill any innocent people,

542
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,780
as long as you can be
in the courtroom as an attorney?

543
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,219
But what are you going to do now?

544
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,489
Your life is in my hands now.

545
00:40:19,659 --> 00:40:21,619
My life is in the hands of the law.

546
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:24,329
It's not up to you to decide.

547
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:25,860
Besides,

548
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:30,769
the person who cherishes
my life more than I do...

549
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:32,940
is my attorney.

550
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:39,840
I also hope that
Jae I wins this trial.

551
00:40:41,179 --> 00:40:42,210
Right.

552
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,309
She told me.

553
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:47,849
I'm not interested in knowing
whether you really meant it or not,

554
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,690
but I do want to know...

555
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:52,719
why you said such a thing.

556
00:40:59,059 --> 00:41:01,400
(The first trial for
the Choi Dae Woong murder case)

557
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,030
There she is. She's his attorney.

558
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:31,789
(Defense Attorney, Defendant)

559
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:40,369
Don't be nervous.

560
00:41:41,539 --> 00:41:42,809
I'm not nervous at all.

561
00:41:43,269 --> 00:41:45,139
You're one fearless lawyer, Jae I.

562
00:41:45,139 --> 00:41:46,610
I can't believe
this is making you nervous.

563
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:48,510
I told you, I'm not nervous.

564
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,079
Now that I'm sitting here,

565
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:56,289
I'm realizing the utter importance
of an attorney's role.

566
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:57,949
Sitting here,

567
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:01,289
I can see how much
my client is relying on me.

568
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:06,500
The judge is entering.

569
00:42:06,929 --> 00:42:08,300
All rise.

570
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,849
Please be seated.

571
00:42:26,449 --> 00:42:28,880
We'll now begin the first trial...

572
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,050
for the Choi Dae Woong murder case.

573
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:34,159
Prosecution,
tell us your reason for indictment.

574
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:41,099
According to Article 250 Section 1
of the Penal Code,

575
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:45,369
I indict the defendant,
Bong Sang Pil, for murder.

576
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,239
The defendant, Bong Sang Pil,

577
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:56,010
asked the victim, Choi Dae Woong,

578
00:42:56,809 --> 00:42:57,980
to meet him...

579
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:02,250
at a soon-to-be demolished building
in Sinjeong at around 4pm on May 9.

580
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,349
At the scene,

581
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:07,059
he tied the victim with ropes
and threatened him.

582
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,789
The victim didn't give in,

583
00:43:09,159 --> 00:43:10,929
so the defendant stabbed him,
which critically injured him.

584
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:15,400
Then he pushed the victim
off the roof and killed him.

585
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:18,500
On the rope
tied around the deceased...

586
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,570
and on the murder weapon,

587
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:24,340
we found prints
belonging to Bong Sang Pil.

588
00:43:30,579 --> 00:43:34,019
In Choi Dae Woong's system,
we found traces of procaine.

589
00:43:34,019 --> 00:43:37,590
Procaine is an anesthetic
not carried at local pharmacies.

590
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:42,159
On the day of the incident,
we searched the suspect's law firm.

591
00:43:42,389 --> 00:43:44,690
There, we found procaine.

592
00:43:44,889 --> 00:43:46,059
The first evidence...

593
00:43:46,829 --> 00:43:47,929
is the procaine.

594
00:43:49,969 --> 00:43:53,670
Suspect Bong Sang Pil
dosed the deceased with procaine,

595
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:56,409
incapacitating him,
and carried out his crime.

596
00:43:57,409 --> 00:44:00,610
This indicates
premeditation on his part...

597
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:04,110
which makes this
a more heinous crime.

598
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,789
Here's the MOA with H Company...

599
00:44:10,789 --> 00:44:12,820
regarding
the Golden City redevelopment.

600
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:18,090
See? Why keep a person dangling...

601
00:44:18,329 --> 00:44:21,099
when this was
the only course of action?

602
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:24,300
My goodness.

603
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:26,840
Gosh, thank you.

604
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,369
Could you pose for a photo, sir?

605
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:33,980
Once every part
of the area is cleaned,

606
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:36,110
- start on the redevelopment.
- Sure thing.

607
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:37,780
- All right.
- This way, sir.

608
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,449
- I'll get going then.
- Thank you so much.

609
00:44:39,449 --> 00:44:40,449
This way.

610
00:44:44,949 --> 00:44:48,190
Gwan Dong, it's almost time
for Sang Pil's trial.

611
00:44:48,289 --> 00:44:50,989
How good of an actor
is this witness we planted?

612
00:44:51,429 --> 00:44:53,400
He'll take the stage soon, sir.

613
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:54,630
Is that so?

614
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:57,070
You probably know this,

615
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:00,570
but tell him to act naturally.

616
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:03,409
Have him behave naturally
like water streaming down a river.

617
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,610
- All right?
- Sir, please state...

618
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:07,710
what you saw
on the day of the incident.

619
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,650
It's quite a deserted area,

620
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:11,650
so I was probably
the only one there.

621
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:14,380
I was out on a walk...

622
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,519
when I saw a man on the rooftop.

623
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:17,619
What did you see?

624
00:45:20,219 --> 00:45:23,889
That man throwing a dead man
off the roof.

625
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,829
Are you sure it's him?

626
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:28,630
Yes.

627
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:30,969
That'll be all, Your Honor.

628
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:35,539
Defense Attorney,
please cross-examine.

629
00:45:40,409 --> 00:45:41,539
You just said...

630
00:45:41,539 --> 00:45:45,710
that you saw Bong Sang Pil
throw the deceased off the roof.

631
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:47,079
That's right.

632
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,480
I see.

633
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:51,289
There was quite a distance
from where you were,

634
00:45:51,449 --> 00:45:53,420
so how can you be so sure?

635
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:57,360
Because I saw it with my own eyes.

636
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,300
Could you be mistaken?

637
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:01,300
No.

638
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:03,869
- I'm sure.
- Then,

639
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,969
please look at this photo.

640
00:46:08,539 --> 00:46:10,739
Do you remember this billboard?

641
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:14,110
It was on the rooftop
of the building in question.

642
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,809
Yes, I think I remember seeing it.

643
00:46:20,949 --> 00:46:23,119
What color was the billboard?

644
00:46:23,349 --> 00:46:25,320
You can answer since you saw it.

645
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,389
I think it was red.

646
00:46:30,059 --> 00:46:31,230
Are you sure?

647
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,230
Yes, it was red.

648
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:42,469
Sir, what color is it now?

649
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:47,739
It's white.

650
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:52,150
Given this, are you still sure...

651
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:54,920
of what you saw that day?

652
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:57,989
- Well...
- Please answer.

653
00:47:00,659 --> 00:47:03,130
A man's life is at stake.

654
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:07,429
Can you...

655
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,230
truly be sure of
what you saw that day?

656
00:47:32,289 --> 00:47:33,460
Objection.

657
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:37,260
Whether he remembers
the color of the billboard...

658
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:39,159
isn't the issue here.

659
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,630
When we come across shocking events,

660
00:47:42,199 --> 00:47:45,500
it's in our nature
to focus solely on that.

661
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:49,400
This is to verify whether
his testimony is credible,

662
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:51,210
Your Honor.

663
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:58,610
All right.

664
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:00,750
The jury...

665
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:04,449
will objectively take
claims by both side...

666
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:06,659
into consideration.

667
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,760
That concludes the questioning
of this witness.

668
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,429
We're now in recess.

669
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,500
(Court)

670
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:33,579
You're the nephew of
the late Choi Dae Woong.

671
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:37,090
From what age did he raise you?

672
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:40,590
It was at the age of 10,
after I had lost my mother.

673
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:42,289
In 2010,

674
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:45,289
assault charges were
brought up against you...

675
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:47,929
by the prosecutor
standing before you.

676
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:49,869
Yes, that's right.

677
00:48:49,869 --> 00:48:52,500
The gang you were
affiliated with at the time...

678
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:54,440
- was led by Choi Dae Woong.
- Yes.

679
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:57,809
The defendant's prior crimes
is not a subject of this hearing.

680
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:01,110
It leads to the defendant's motive.

681
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:03,579
Objection overruled.
I will allow it.

682
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:06,750
Why did you suddenly
move to Kiseong?

683
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:10,519
Was it a sign of betrayal?

684
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:15,119
- No.
- I have a witness...

685
00:49:15,289 --> 00:49:19,630
stating that Choi Dae Woong
wasn't fond of your move to Kiseong.

686
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:20,829
Do you care to elaborate?

687
00:49:21,699 --> 00:49:25,130
The defendant played a crucial role
in the business...

688
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:27,039
operated by the deceased.

689
00:49:27,469 --> 00:49:28,769
So him...

690
00:49:29,539 --> 00:49:31,969
suddenly moving to another city...

691
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:35,480
must have put a damper
on Choi Dae Woong's plans.

692
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,150
So...

693
00:49:38,949 --> 00:49:39,980
maybe,

694
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:43,550
it was the late Choi Dae Woong
who betrayed you...

695
00:49:43,949 --> 00:49:45,789
and came at you first.

696
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,590
You were only acting
in self-defense.

697
00:49:48,989 --> 00:49:50,130
That's not true.

698
00:49:53,659 --> 00:49:57,570
Who has the most to gain
following Choi Dae Woong's death?

699
00:49:57,570 --> 00:50:01,400
It's the defendant, Bong Sang Pil.

700
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:06,039
- Objection.
- Overruled.

701
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:09,510
The uncle who wasn't pleased
with his nephew's decision...

702
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:13,219
followed him to Kiseong
to interfere with his plans.

703
00:50:13,449 --> 00:50:17,420
The spiteful nephew retaliated
with premeditated murder.

704
00:50:19,019 --> 00:50:20,289
Also, the nephew...

705
00:50:20,789 --> 00:50:22,690
tried to use his uncle's death...

706
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:24,730
to claim an insurance payout,

707
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:27,829
which is nothing
but cruel and atrocious.

708
00:50:27,829 --> 00:50:29,500
Are you kidding me?

709
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,000
His heinous actions...

710
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:34,199
are a crime against humanity.

711
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:41,780
All right. Good.

712
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:48,880
Mr. Mayor, the trial
is going in our favor.

713
00:50:51,219 --> 00:50:52,949
There's no need for you to worry.

714
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:57,489
You can never be sure with a trial
until the very last moment.

715
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,360
Yes, of course.

716
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:02,860
Do you know...

717
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:05,929
how a cuckoo builds its nest?

718
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:10,440
A cuckoo as in
the bird that chirps like this?

719
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:13,710
Cuckoos don't have their own nests.

720
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,409
They lay their eggs
is another bird's nest.

721
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:19,550
When theirs hatch,

722
00:51:20,179 --> 00:51:22,880
they chuck the other bird's eggs
out of the nest.

723
00:51:24,219 --> 00:51:25,920
That's one cruel bird.

724
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,019
So only those
who survive its cruelty...

725
00:51:29,559 --> 00:51:31,559
get a chance to fly.

726
00:51:32,429 --> 00:51:33,630
I see.

727
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:38,329
Just so you know,
Kiseong is my nest.

728
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,599
I'll kill those that
don't line up beneath me.

729
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:50,349
(Ha's Photo Studio)

730
00:51:50,349 --> 00:51:51,349
We're here.

731
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:55,449
Why did you follow us here?

732
00:51:55,449 --> 00:51:58,550
We need to be at least
a group of three to feel safe.

733
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:00,019
Don't you know that?

734
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:07,130
Gosh, this is pretty.

735
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:09,230
Give me a second. I'll quickly
gather only what I need.

736
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:10,230
- Sure thing.
- Sure.

737
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:13,599
I had no idea we still had
photo studios like this here.

738
00:52:13,769 --> 00:52:16,570
Hello. May we help you?

739
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:19,769
I'm here to take
an identification photo.

740
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,280
I see.

741
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,449
Jae I, she wants to
have her ID picture taken.

742
00:52:24,449 --> 00:52:26,650
We're closed now.

743
00:52:27,579 --> 00:52:30,050
I urgently need an ID picture.

744
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,550
Can I take one?

745
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:33,789
My father isn't here now.
Please visit us tomorrow.

746
00:52:33,789 --> 00:52:35,159
You can take it though.

747
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:39,489
I really need it today.

748
00:52:40,329 --> 00:52:43,969
Jae I, if you know how to do it,
just take one for her.

749
00:52:43,969 --> 00:52:46,230
The other studios
would be closed already.

750
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:49,699
Please come this way.

751
00:53:05,389 --> 00:53:07,260
You should take off the sunglasses.

752
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:09,719
I'm sorry.

753
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,760
Please lean your head
slightly to the left.

754
00:53:15,099 --> 00:53:16,130
To the left...

755
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,099
Here, let me help you.

756
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:33,349
Please look at the camera,
not at me.

757
00:53:33,579 --> 00:53:34,980
In 1 and 2.

758
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:41,889
What did you do to my mom?

759
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:46,630
Did you kill her?

760
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:48,829
I'm sorry.

761
00:53:53,769 --> 00:53:54,940
What's wrong?

762
00:53:56,170 --> 00:53:58,909
You look a lot like my mom.

763
00:54:00,179 --> 00:54:03,880
You can't say such a thing
to a young lady like her.

764
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,809
- I'm sorry.
- No, I didn't mean it.

765
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:09,050
- I'll take it again. I'm sorry.
- Okay.

766
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:10,920
1 and 2.

767
00:54:13,659 --> 00:54:14,820
Okay. It's done.

768
00:54:14,989 --> 00:54:16,389
The photo will be ready soon.

769
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:18,989
By the way,

770
00:54:19,659 --> 00:54:23,199
did you come to the funeral
of Detective Wu Hyung Man?

771
00:54:25,329 --> 00:54:26,840
Do you remember me?

772
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:30,039
Yes. Please wait for a moment.

773
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,409
You even take photos well.

774
00:54:39,349 --> 00:54:41,079
Jae I, I'm here.

775
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,420
What are you doing?

776
00:54:44,619 --> 00:54:45,849
I'm printing out a photo.
We have a customer.

777
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:47,059
Did you take the picture?

778
00:54:47,389 --> 00:54:48,789
Excuse me, your photo...

779
00:55:21,159 --> 00:55:22,289
It's been a long time.

780
00:55:23,429 --> 00:55:25,929
You were newly-elected
when my father was alive.

781
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:29,059
And you're the representative
of the party now. How time flies.

782
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:33,300
Time has changed a lot of things.

783
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:36,000
And Kiseong have made
a lot of progress.

784
00:55:37,239 --> 00:55:40,010
Thanks to you, a virtuous woman.

785
00:55:41,579 --> 00:55:43,409
And you've become humorous.

786
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,050
If you have anything to tell me,
you can talk to him from now on.

787
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:53,320
You're going too far.
I haven't said anything yet.

788
00:55:55,059 --> 00:55:56,320
Politics is...

789
00:55:56,730 --> 00:55:59,659
a war in which you should
fight smiling.

790
00:56:00,829 --> 00:56:03,829
He said it was a war fought smiling
while hiding your sword.

791
00:56:03,829 --> 00:56:04,929
That's what my father said.

792
00:56:06,469 --> 00:56:09,400
I feel sorry for your father.

793
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,570
Now that enough time has passed,

794
00:56:11,909 --> 00:56:13,170
we should move on.

795
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:19,880
You pushed my father out
in the blink of an eye.

796
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:22,550
And now you need me?

797
00:56:22,949 --> 00:56:26,349
All Kiseong citizens are well aware
of Judge Cha Byung Ho's achievement.

798
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,590
And now, we need his esteemed
daughter, Judge Cha Moon Sook,

799
00:56:29,889 --> 00:56:32,489
to follow in her father's footsteps
serve the people.

800
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,130
You're talking about my father...

801
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:40,030
to get rid of my excuses
to refuse your offer.

802
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:45,409
Thanks to you, I will
never be able to trust people.

803
00:56:46,539 --> 00:56:50,309
It will be the chance of a lifetime
to redound to your father's honor.

804
00:56:51,179 --> 00:56:54,579
And it will be a good chance for me
to apologize what I did in the past.

805
00:56:54,579 --> 00:56:56,679
Please propose to me in a way...

806
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:59,349
that will convince me to accept,

807
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:03,360
for someone who has no wants.

808
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:07,199
Okay. So you're giving me
a half yes today.

809
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:13,699
Drink your tea before it gets cold.

810
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:30,619
You're smiling but look tired.

811
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:34,559
Losing someone you cherish.

812
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:36,889
It hurts.

813
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,900
Since you cut off my hand,

814
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:44,269
I should cut something
of yours off too.

815
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:47,570
Obviously,

816
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:52,639
I should probably target
someone who's very dear to you.

817
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:57,150
Sang Pil.

818
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,719
Can't you just...

819
00:58:02,849 --> 00:58:05,489
try to live a happy, normal life...

820
00:58:06,889 --> 00:58:08,559
with that lady from now on?

821
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:12,460
I'll deal with An Oh Ju
and Cha Moon Sook.

822
00:58:15,829 --> 00:58:16,829
Is it...

823
00:58:18,329 --> 00:58:21,139
that Uncle Dae Woong
was preparing something?

824
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:25,210
Will you be okay
with just Mr. Tae's help?

825
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:27,880
I'll bring a few guys
who can help you.

826
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,139
How dare you kill him?

827
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:31,679
Do you suspect me too?

828
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:32,980
What if you can't prove it?

829
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,420
Then you'll die by my hands.

830
00:58:46,329 --> 00:58:49,500
You came to the photo studio
the other day, right?

831
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:50,670
Hello.

832
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:54,900
What brings you here?

833
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:55,940
I...

834
00:58:57,170 --> 00:58:59,010
work as an acupressurist...

835
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:00,840
at Judge Cha Moon Sook's
private residence.

836
00:59:01,239 --> 00:59:02,239
Pardon?

837
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:06,150
Choi Dae Woong,
who is in your case,

838
00:59:07,179 --> 00:59:08,619
brought me to you.

839
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:10,250
Choi Dae...

840
00:59:11,989 --> 00:59:13,489
And Choi Dae Woong...

841
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:17,429
gave me this picture.

842
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:33,840
I'm fighting against Cha Moon Sook.

843
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:37,179
Just like you are now.

844
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:45,619
Scorpion.

845
00:59:46,389 --> 00:59:47,420
Follow me.

846
00:59:55,059 --> 00:59:56,730
I heard it from Man Bae.

847
00:59:57,570 --> 00:59:59,130
There was evidence
submitted in the trial.

848
01:00:00,469 --> 01:00:01,539
You...

849
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,809
lied to me.

850
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:06,670
The trial isn't over yet.

851
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:07,679
You punk!

852
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:11,550
You got good at making excuses,
now that you're a lawyer.

853
01:00:12,449 --> 01:00:13,480
Are you scared?

854
01:00:19,719 --> 01:00:21,989
You should know very well...

855
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:24,590
what Dae Woong meant to me.

856
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:46,909
You punk! Are you ignoring me?

857
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:21,880
Scorpion.

858
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:23,119
You punk.

859
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:36,760
You punk! What are you doing?

860
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:46,710
Guard!

861
01:01:49,909 --> 01:01:51,809
This is the only way...

862
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:54,349
to prove my innocence.

863
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:57,719
Just go.

864
01:02:19,869 --> 01:02:21,679
This doggone world...

865
01:02:23,309 --> 01:02:26,380
no longer follows the law
or has people we can trust.

866
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,420
Revenge...

867
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:32,090
only brings more revenge.

868
01:03:06,219 --> 01:03:07,960
(Lawless Lawyer)

869
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:09,619
What do you know?

870
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:11,889
Don't think the past
has been completely erased...

871
01:03:11,889 --> 01:03:14,260
for the past is what
shapes the future.

872
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:17,400
The trial may be important,
but you're more important to me.

873
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:18,530
You scum!

874
01:03:18,530 --> 01:03:20,070
He's a crocodile...

875
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:23,469
that can eat anything that crosses
his mouth at any time.

876
01:03:23,469 --> 01:03:27,280
By reporting after doing the deed,
you're challenging my authority.

877
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,610
I guess I'm awake
from my sweet dream now.

878
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:33,110
Who has the power
to go to this length...

879
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:35,619
to kill us both?
