(Lawless Lawyer)

00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:33,270
(Episode 2)

8
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:38,710
Hello, it's nice to meet you.

9
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:42,679
I'm Attorney Bong Sang Pil.

10
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,549
Do you know me?

11
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,350
Don't we all start off as strangers?

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,960
Attorney Bong Sang Pil?

13
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,990
I want to represent you,

14
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:57,600
so you should switch lawyers.

15
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:00,570
Is this how lawyers
get clients these days?

16
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:02,929
I see you're in
desperate need of work.

17
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:05,200
I was quite famous in Seoul.

18
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:09,939
It's a shame because I
already have a decent lawyer.

19
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,680
Did you see that man
killing your mom with your own eyes?

20
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,650
Yes, I did. I saw that.

21
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,019
Hyung Man, grab a hold of that kid.

22
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:26,459
I need to get something out of him.

23
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:28,890
Let go!

24
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,730
Let go of me!

25
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,739
Detective Wu Hyung Man,

26
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,569
let me make you a free man.

27
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,719
Do you even know who my lawyer is?

28
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:54,719
Of course, I do. Mr. Go In Du.

29
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,489
He's the best lawyer in Kiseong.

30
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,790
He's a retired judge
after 25 years on the bench.

31
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,730
He's still extremely influential.

32
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,930
Now, he's a legal advisor
to Oh Ju Group.

33
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,000
You know him very well.

34
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:11,539
Mr. Go told me that he's
100 percent sure we'll win the case.

35
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:13,000
"100 percent"?

36
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:17,080
You see,
trials are not about probability.

37
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,039
I don't know what that means.

38
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:21,009
I'll let you in
on one of my trade secrets.

39
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:23,650
Lawyers who are sure that they'll
win always lose no matter what.

40
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,719
You shouldn't have believed his
bluffing. That old man lied to you.

41
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,150
- Let's get going.
- Gosh.

42
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:30,560
My goodness,
is she your sales partner?

43
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,319
I must say, she's easy on the eyes.

44
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,629
Get up already.

45
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:37,159
Oh, she's our paralegal. She's very
capable, so let us handle your case.

46
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:38,259
What are you doing now?

47
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:40,530
Don't you have any pride
as a lawyer?

48
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:43,569
In this day and age, lawyers must do
more than just defending people.

49
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,639
- Aren't I right?
- Does that mean...

50
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,610
you have another job or what?

51
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,240
I'm more like a problem solver.

52
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:52,479
The best problem solver
who's a licensed lawyer.

53
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,310
I came to ask you
to teach a lawyer a lesson.

54
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,780
Bong Sang Pil.

55
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,349
"I'll be sure you get
compensated monetarily..."

56
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,419
"for all the tears you've shed."

57
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,319
My goodness,
he must be good at what he does.

58
00:03:05,389 --> 00:03:09,789
Well, you ignore all the laws
that exist in this country.

59
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:12,560
Why are you suddenly interested
in this lawyer?

60
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:18,500
Well, there was a little incident.

61
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:21,740
I've been thinking hard,
but I don't understand...

62
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:26,139
why a successful lawyer in Seoul
chose to move to Kiseong.

63
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,050
I can't stop thinking
that something is fishy.

64
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,409
Kiseong.

65
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,750
The letters themselves
mean "silk" and "castle".

66
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,349
A city built with silk, Kiseong.

67
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,189
Don't you get a whiff of money?

68
00:03:36,289 --> 00:03:37,389
Silk... What?

69
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:41,590
What I'm saying is, this city
is like paradise to lawyers.

70
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:44,030
And for people like you and I,

71
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,830
Kiseong is such a great playground.

72
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:51,199
Then what do you think it is
to lawyers that are loyal to us?

73
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,569
It's like a field where you can
collect money left and right.

74
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:57,310
You're right.

75
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,780
I moved to Seoul to make it big,

76
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,210
but you've done a better job here.

77
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:05,620
My gosh, I should've
just stayed here as well.

78
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,090
You and I are...

79
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:11,120
in different leagues now.

80
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,930
We've known each other for years.

81
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:19,860
I'd really appreciate it
if you let me work with you again.

82
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:24,100
Goodness, what's he saying now?

83
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,939
Chairman An is no longer
a gangster like you.

84
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:31,110
He's a businessman,
a successful entrepreneur.

85
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,680
But you never know
what can happen in life.

86
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:42,589
If you ever need someone
who's skilled with knives,

87
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,819
please call me.

88
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,689
Then I'll get going now.

89
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,240
Detective Wu who's charged with
the murder of Mayor Lee Young Soo...

90
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,769
will stand his first trial.

91
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,310
Due to Mayor Lee Young Soo's
absence, a mayoral election...

92
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,579
will take place in Kiseong as well
during the upcoming by-elections.

93
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,709
More than ever,
the public's interest in...

94
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,649
It's most likely that he'll be found
guilty. You want to snatch the case?

95
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:14,319
Yes. Aren't there too many pieces
of evidence? It's suspicious.

96
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:16,720
There's no evidence whatsoever
to prove Detective Wu not guilty.

97
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,889
I know that too.

98
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,029
Anyone can tell
that Wu Hyung Man is a murderer.

99
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,290
Be honest with me.

100
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,529
What's the real reason
you want to work on this case?

101
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:27,629
- "The real reason"?
- Yes.

102
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,639
Gosh, I'm hungry.

103
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,199
Let's eat something.

104
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,709
Thank you.

105
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,439
Gosh, I'm starving.

106
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:42,750
Meet me in the judge's office.

107
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:46,079
Here, it's yours.

108
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:51,160
Actually, jerks like Wu Hyung Man
would give us more return...

109
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,990
on investment
than any other clients would.

110
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,129
Let's say I get him acquitted.

111
00:05:56,329 --> 00:05:59,259
The word would spread
all over Kiseong in no time.

112
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:03,129
Then rich prospective clients,
who have done many bad deeds,

113
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:06,839
will flock to us
with fat bundles of cash.

114
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,370
Are you saying you're doing it
for publicity?

115
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,709
What?

116
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:14,879
Well, winning the trial
will be like winning the lottery.

117
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:17,449
If we lose, we'll just get paid,
and that will be it.

118
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:20,949
You're actually...

119
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:22,819
a lot worse than I thought you'd be.

120
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,629
Gosh. Do you know
how expensive this suit is?

121
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:30,029
To you, court is where you can
scratch off your lottery ticket,

122
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:31,959
and you see clients
as mere bundles of cash.

123
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,699
Who's worse?

124
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:37,839
The evil detective
who killed the mayor of Kiseong?

125
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,439
Or the shady lawyer who wants
to get that jerk acquitted...

126
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,709
just because of money?

127
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,639
What about the former lawyer...

128
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:49,449
who's judging the defendant
that hasn't even been proven guilty?

129
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,490
Gosh, what a mess.

130
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,759
Hey, Ha Jae I!

131
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,879
I don't feel good
about leaving the mayor position...

132
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,250
vacant at the moment.

133
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:31,019
It's an important role that supports
you and the City of Kiseong,

134
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:32,959
so you should take a good look
at the candidates...

135
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,029
and make your decision.

136
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:37,500
I obviously...

137
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,629
have a plan.

138
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:44,399
Have you decided whom you'd like
to see running for the election?

139
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,769
Who do you think it is?

140
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,670
Isn't it
Chief Prosecutor Jang Sa Ik?

141
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,709
Wrong.

142
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,050
Then is it the editor-in-chief
of "Kiseong Daily",

143
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:57,379
Han Tae Kyeong?

144
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,990
If it's not him either...
Then who else is there?

145
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:05,490
Let's see. Oh, is it someone
who's not in Kiseong?

146
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,290
Of course not.

147
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,100
Are you thinking...

148
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:19,800
Me?

149
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:24,240
Would you like me
to run for the election?

150
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:30,720
Are you cut out for the job
of mayor of Kiseong?

151
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,220
Are you being serious right now?

152
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,419
My gosh.

153
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,590
Goodness, this is...

154
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,389
I can't believe you chose me.
My gosh.

155
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:44,559
I'm... I'm truly honored!

156
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,269
You've been trying to act like
a businessman for the last 15 years,

157
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:51,000
but you haven't changed one bit
from the time you were a gangster.

158
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,269
You should get into politics.

159
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:55,669
That suits you better.

160
00:08:55,909 --> 00:08:57,240
Right, I...

161
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,509
I understand
what you're trying to say, ma'am.

162
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,580
I'll do my best, Judge Cha!

163
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:04,320
You can leave it to me, ma'am.

164
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,789
By any chance,
does Chairman An know...

165
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,159
who actually killed
Mayor Lee Young Soo?

166
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,129
How would Chairman An know
who killed him?

167
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:18,230
Even if Kiseong is in the palm of
his hand, how would he know?

168
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,399
Had he known who did it, he would've
whacked the killer already, right?

169
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,029
I mean,
his friend is locked up here.

170
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,570
Of course.

171
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:27,200
Anyway...

172
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,210
Is there...

173
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:38,019
any favor
you want to ask Chairman An...

174
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:41,149
or anything you need to give to him?

175
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,000
Jae I!

176
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,440
- Help me with this.
- Sure.

177
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:04,840
No clothes can be heavier
and more uncomfortable than this.

178
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,409
No one looks better than you do
in the judicial robe.

179
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:09,950
You're talking
like everyone else does.

180
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,919
I can't handle the weight
of that robe.

181
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,289
About that lawyer...

182
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,799
Is he trying to take the case?

183
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:27,129
Yes.

184
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:29,899
Bong Sang Pil
doesn't follow the basics,

185
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,740
but it's hard to ignore him.

186
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,440
And you'll be conducting
Wu Hyung Man's trial, you know.

187
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,539
Have you gone through
the case report?

188
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:42,710
There's a ton of evidence that shows
Wu Hyung Man is the killer.

189
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,620
But there's one thing.

190
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,320
It's a murder case,

191
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,149
but he has no motive.

192
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,220
There are a lot of cases
without a motive.

193
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,789
Random killings
happen often as well.

194
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,059
I know that,

195
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:00,159
but there's something
that bothers me.

196
00:11:00,629 --> 00:11:01,830
Like what?

197
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:05,799
I think I'll have a better idea
after meeting Wu Hyung Man.

198
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,240
All right.

199
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,639
I know that you need answers
when you're curious about something.

200
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:15,179
Jae I.

201
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:17,179
Wasn't it your birthday recently?

202
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,049
Shall we head out together?

203
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,519
Ms. Cha, I love this dress.

204
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,389
That looks pretty on you.
What about this one?

205
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,860
- It's so pretty.
- Try it on.

206
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:36,600
How do you know my style so well?

207
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:39,200
Can you call me Mom like
you did when you were a kid...

208
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,110
even if it's just
while you're in Kiseong?

209
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:50,450
Mom.

210
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:55,990
I like it when you call me that.

211
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,289
I missed it.

212
00:11:58,289 --> 00:12:01,259
I thought
you'd join the Supreme Court.

213
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:04,730
I had no idea you'd
stay as a judge here.

214
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,429
This place is my cradle and grave,

215
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:07,500
so why would I leave?

216
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,669
You're just like your family
who's been loyal to this city.

217
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,940
My father...

218
00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:18,009
Well,
I'm still nowhere near his level.

219
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,809
Judge Cha, we should go.

220
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,350
My gosh.

221
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,149
Look who it is.

222
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:27,690
Aren't you...

223
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,250
Jae I?

224
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,220
My goodness!

225
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,659
It's been so long.

226
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:35,629
How many years has it been?

227
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,960
Gosh.

228
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:40,970
Hello, ma'am.

229
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:45,539
What you did was beyond generous.

230
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:49,269
Thanks to you,
my Yeon Hee became a prosecutor.

231
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,440
- Really?
- In order to become successful,

232
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,450
one should have at least one rival,

233
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,950
even though that rival
isn't much of one.

234
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,549
Did you have to say that?

235
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,159
Judge Cha,

236
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:07,929
you always seem to
adore Jae I over Yeon Hee.

237
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,330
You and your jealousy.

238
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:14,059
Anyway,

239
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:17,600
people like me
and Prosecutor Kang...

240
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:21,039
need ordinary people like you
around us.

241
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,639
So...

242
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:25,309
be proud of yourself.

243
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,720
So who knows which word
goes in the blank?

244
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,320
How dare you try
and ruin my Yeon Hee's future?

245
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,529
Is it that hard to
give her a full score?

246
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:46,159
What will you do if she doesn't
make it into Seoul University?

247
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,259
Ms. Nam!

248
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,269
We're in the middle of a class.

249
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,539
Jae I, it's all right.

250
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,269
Why are you letting her
treat you this way?

251
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,639
You impudent little wench.
How dare you talk this way?

252
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,840
Why you...

253
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,080
You little brat.

254
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:08,120
You're the one being rude here.

255
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:13,090
I get it now. You're Ha Jae I,
my daughter's rival at school.

256
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,929
I'll call the cops on you.

257
00:14:14,929 --> 00:14:15,990
"The cops"?

258
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:20,830
My goodness, this is hilarious.

259
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,399
Don't you know who I am?

260
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:23,929
Please leave.

261
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,039
You...

262
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,039
I'll keep you in mind.

263
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:32,080
Ha Jae I.

264
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,610
You're...

265
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,350
on my blacklist.

266
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,620
What are you looking at?

267
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,450
I'm off.

268
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:50,559
You're a lawyer, right?

269
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:52,529
I guess you succeeded too.

270
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:57,169
Still, one from a dump
can't make it up high.

271
00:14:58,139 --> 00:14:59,169
I wish you luck.

272
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,309
Judge Cha, it's time.

273
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:06,139
Okay, I'll see you around.

274
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:08,549
You too. Have a good day.

275
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,590
- Judge Cha!
- Judge Cha!

276
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,220
- Mom.
- Mom!

277
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,230
Hi, Young Chul.

278
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:23,230
How have you been?

279
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,230
I've been good.

280
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:28,399
Wow, that is a lot of presents
for a lot of children.

281
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:31,370
This is In Ho.

282
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,940
She's Na Ri.

283
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:37,440
And this is smart Yoon Soo,
who gets good grades.

284
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,080
- What's this?
- What a lovely moment...

285
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,379
Sir, this is a little something...

286
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:43,610
- from the judge.
- Thank you, as always.

287
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,250
Please don't mention it.

288
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,850
- Bye!
- Bye!

289
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,889
Mom will be back, so be good.

290
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:51,090
- Bye!
- Bye!

291
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,990
- Bye.
- Bye, guys.

292
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:54,789
Thank you so much.

293
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:58,429
We got a great story, so thank you.
We'll see you next time.

294
00:15:58,429 --> 00:15:59,529
Okay. Bye.

295
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:00,759
- Bye.
- Bye.

296
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:03,899
Judge Cha, what a great interview.

297
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:05,899
The reporter was
more than satisfied.

298
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:07,370
I'm glad.

299
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,769
By the way,

300
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:12,039
can I ask about
the next mayoral election?

301
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:15,610
There's a rumor that
you have your eyes on someone.

302
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:16,610
Who said that?

303
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,779
They all have such big mouths.

304
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:22,250
One word from you and
he or she'll be a shoo-in.

305
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,759
That's why everyone wants
to be on your good side.

306
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:28,289
Oh, please. Can't they just
leave her out of this?

307
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:30,960
Judge Cha,
I'm sure you're exhausted.

308
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:34,370
I'm actually looking for
a talented masseuse to hire.

309
00:16:34,669 --> 00:16:36,399
- Good day, ma'am.
- You too.

310
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:40,840
Do you remember
every single name of the children?

311
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:45,809
Yes, everyone born in Kiseong
is my child.

312
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,179
I'm married to Kiseong.

313
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,480
The fact that Judge Cha has been...

314
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,179
visiting the orphans
of Kiseong for 10 years...

315
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,090
was reported by the foreign press.

316
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:58,789
She was voted as
Most Admired Woman of Power...

317
00:16:58,789 --> 00:17:00,889
and was won first place
as Best Future Leader...

318
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:02,759
by a huge margin.

319
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,859
It's a title she has
been holding for years.

320
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:07,359
Meanwhile, Kiseong's...

321
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,630
"542 dollars"?

322
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,599
What's this? 542 dollars?

323
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,369
It's for the suit you ruined
with ketchup the other day.

324
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:19,009
- So?
- It's a limited edition...

325
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:21,309
that I had to wait
six months to receive.

326
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:23,509
It can only be cleaned
at the office in Italy.

327
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:26,880
So I charged you for that
and the round-trip air fare.

328
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,819
It's worth two months of your pay.

329
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:31,289
When my suspension is lifted
in six months,

330
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:32,890
I'll pay it back all at once.

331
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,019
Sounds good.

332
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:36,990
Just so you know, Detective Wu's
case isn't different for me.

333
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,930
My principles haven't changed...

334
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,599
even after I started to work here.

335
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:41,599
I see.

336
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:45,170
Article 1, Section 1 of
the Attorneys-at-Law Act.

337
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:47,869
"Attorneys defend
all basic human rights..."

338
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:50,539
- "and strive to seek justice."
- No way.

339
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:53,309
Even lawyers like you
know the Attorneys-at-Law Act.

340
00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:55,009
My goodness.

341
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:56,910
Lawyers are businessmen though.

342
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,049
Unlike doctors,
we don't get public insurance.

343
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:02,819
However,
they make laws saying that...

344
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:04,089
we should seek justice.

345
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:06,319
- Isn't it ironic?
- Don't you...

346
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:07,789
have any pride for being a lawyer?

347
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:09,490
Of course I do.

348
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:12,029
I'm a lawless lawyer.

349
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,569
It's fitting.

350
00:18:14,569 --> 00:18:16,430
You don't care about the law.

351
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,240
No, that's not it.

352
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,069
It doesn't mean that I don't care.

353
00:18:20,069 --> 00:18:21,069
Boys?

354
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:24,480
It means I'll fight using the law.

355
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,480
I'll fight for my clients,
with the law as my weapon.

356
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,009
That's who I am.

357
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:32,079
(Always push forward.)

358
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,819
Were you proud to come up with that?

359
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:42,829
Good job, boys.

360
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,759
Nice. That was awesome!

361
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:48,200
A lawyer should always fight
with the law.

362
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,700
You should keep that in mind.

363
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,339
All right, then. Let's investigate.

364
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:54,940
It's not even our case yet.

365
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,240
Doing our homework
will make it our case.

366
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:59,210
- Mr. Tae.
- Yes?

367
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,210
- Release Droney.
- Yes, sir.

368
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,480
"Droney"? Who's Droney?

369
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,650
Look, it's hovering!

370
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:11,859
Droney, happy hunting.

371
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,130
No way. It's really heading out!

372
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,859
I've only seen this on TV.

373
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:21,599
It's like you live in the future.

374
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,539
Anyway, I'm curious about...

375
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:26,269
Attorney Bong.

376
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,509
I'm talking about our boss,
Mr. Bong Sang Pil.

377
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:35,480
May 13, 2013,

378
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:37,309
9:32pm.

379
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,589
That was when I was
given a new life.

380
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,720
He gave it to me.

381
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,430
You'd be dead if it weren't for me.

382
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,460
Sir, am I still alive?

383
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,660
I thought I saw my life flash by.

384
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,430
Sir!

385
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,099
If this is all that you're made of,

386
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:01,000
- go back to your hometown.
- I'm sorry, sir.

387
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,910
If I see you one more time,

388
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,809
I'll kill you myself.

389
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,390
Come on. Bring it on!

390
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,660
I only stayed in the gang...

391
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:27,930
so that I could serve Bong Pil.

392
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,940
No matter where he ends up,

393
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,039
I'll be there with him.

394
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,670
And I will serve you both.

395
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,039
Count me in!

396
00:20:43,849 --> 00:20:44,880
Sir!

397
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:51,150
That hurts! You twisted it!

398
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,690
This is the where Wu Hyung Man
supposedly killed the victim.

399
00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:04,069
What are you doing?

400
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,769
Isn't it strange that he was stabbed
to death in a refrigerator...

401
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:08,609
that many people come in and out of?

402
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,000
This is a crime scene.

403
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:36,670
We know that already.

404
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,900
Who might you be?

405
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,299
If you touch anything in there,

406
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,069
you'll be arrested for
impeding an investigation.

407
00:21:41,069 --> 00:21:42,369
Why are you here?

408
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,970
Me?

409
00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:46,109
I'm...

410
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,049
- Do you know her?
- Who gave you permission?

411
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:52,319
She's Prosecutor Kang Yeon Hee.

412
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,049
I apologize for not recognizing you.
I'm...

413
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,660
Attorney Bong Sang Pil.

414
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,960
You must have a lot of time
on your hands.

415
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,789
If you're investigating
a case that isn't yours.

416
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:05,759
I never failed to steal something
I set my mind to.

417
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,470
Whether it's a case or a person.

418
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:13,799
Does Detective Wu Hyung Man
really have no alibi?

419
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:14,809
If he did,

420
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:17,339
why would the prosecutor
and I be working so hard?

421
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:18,440
Oh, right.

422
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,410
Goodbye, then.

423
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,950
You must not have that many cases.

424
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,089
Shall I find you a good paralegal?

425
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:33,359
You will face me...

426
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,789
in court over this case.

427
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:38,029
I don't need a new paralegal.

428
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,500
It's a crime scene,
so assist your prosecutor well.

429
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,440
Let's go, Ms. Ha.

430
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:51,809
- Why are we here?
- There he is.

431
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,579
Aren't you Attorney Go In Du?

432
00:22:54,579 --> 00:22:56,410
- Talk to my secretary.
- I'm...

433
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:59,920
Attorney Bong Sang Pil.

434
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:03,950
I don't recognize you.
What do you want?

435
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,460
Toss me Detective Wu's case.

436
00:23:06,589 --> 00:23:07,660
What?

437
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:12,200
I know this isn't right of me,

438
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,069
but I really need to represent him.

439
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:18,029
I heard that many lawyers...

440
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:19,839
have a hard time getting cases.

441
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:23,910
I feel real pity that you
have to go to such extents.

442
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,609
I'm embarrassed for you.

443
00:23:31,349 --> 00:23:33,119
Rome had Roman laws,

444
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:35,349
and Kiseong has Kiseong's laws.

445
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,990
Unless you want trouble,

446
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:39,259
get lost while I'm playing nice.

447
00:23:49,329 --> 00:23:51,099
Hi. Go ahead.

448
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:59,240
I have far to go to become
anything like Chairman An.

449
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,309
You paid for
his sick wife's treatment...

450
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:04,509
and hired him
a lawyer of my caliber.

451
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:10,420
If you make sure he rots
in prison for a long time,

452
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:13,490
I'm more than willing to pay
your expensive...

453
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,329
lawyer fees and more.

454
00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:20,630
Chairman Ah, I have one question.

455
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:25,799
Does that detective
really have something...

456
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:27,700
that could harm you?

457
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:31,609
I took a good look at it,

458
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,410
but he doesn't.

459
00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:38,380
So, some man who can
provide his alibi...

460
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,049
will be in court.

461
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,890
How will you deal with that?

462
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:46,359
Don't worry about that.
It won't work.

463
00:24:47,089 --> 00:24:51,029
He won't say anything
in favor of Wu Hyung Man.

464
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,140
Give him my message.

465
00:25:32,869 --> 00:25:35,609
If he has something to say,
tell him to come to me personally.

466
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,140
Is this your son?

467
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,279
Which school do you go to?

468
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,250
Kiseong Grade School?

469
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,619
Get your hand off him.

470
00:25:49,619 --> 00:25:50,849
That...

471
00:25:51,859 --> 00:25:53,460
depends on what your mom does.

472
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,259
If your mom will stand down,

473
00:25:57,259 --> 00:25:59,599
I can't do anything to you.

474
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:04,329
Let's go.

475
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:12,779
- Are you awake?
- Yes.

476
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,279
Weren't you afraid of those men?

477
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:19,880
I'm not afraid of bad men at all.

478
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,289
I must get it from you.

479
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,819
You're so brave, Sang Pil.

480
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,259
What did you pray for, Mom?

481
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:35,269
I prayed that you'll become
a great lawyer.

482
00:26:55,849 --> 00:26:57,089
Why don't you go home?

483
00:26:57,089 --> 00:27:00,190
The first hearing's tomorrow
morning. I'll go straight to court.

484
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,230
You work so hard.

485
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:06,529
How did you know that the detective
doesn't trust his lawyer?

486
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:12,799
I'd like to know
how you noticed that.

487
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,069
I suspected it when I first saw him.

488
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,509
I was sure when I saw him again.

489
00:27:18,109 --> 00:27:20,579
- "Again"?
- I visited him.

490
00:27:23,849 --> 00:27:26,920
I knew you were a good lawyer,
but you're better than I expected.

491
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,019
Wu Hyung Man doesn't have
a motive to kill Mayor Lee.

492
00:27:32,059 --> 00:27:36,089
You don't think
he's the real murderer, do you?

493
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:41,660
I think you can
figure that out yourself.

494
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,779
Let's begin the trial.

495
00:27:53,779 --> 00:27:55,650
(First trial of Mayor Lee's murder)

496
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:56,650
Your Honor.

497
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,750
The blood on the weapon...

498
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,180
is that of Mayor Lee Young Soo's.

499
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:03,519
I present NISI's
official report stating so.

500
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:07,160
They also found
the defendant's prints...

501
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,529
on this weapon.

502
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,829
I'm Min Young Jae,
an investigator for the prosecution.

503
00:28:13,829 --> 00:28:16,230
You found the evidence...

504
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,970
with the defendant's traces.

505
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,769
Where was it?

506
00:28:19,769 --> 00:28:22,170
In Detective Wu's locker.

507
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:26,079
We found the mayor's
blood on his pants.

508
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:27,579
Also,

509
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,809
the footprints found on the scene...

510
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:32,519
matched those made by
the detective's shoes.

511
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:37,549
One.

512
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,660
The defendant's prints
found on the murder weapon.

513
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,529
Two.

514
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:45,299
The victim's blood found...

515
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:46,559
on the defendant's clothes.

516
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,500
Three.

517
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,670
The defendant's footprints...

518
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,869
found at the scene.

519
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,569
All the evidence...

520
00:28:54,569 --> 00:28:57,970
say that Detective
Wu Hyung Man is the killer.

521
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:01,480
Defense,
you may cross-examine the witness.

522
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,049
I will not.

523
00:29:12,819 --> 00:29:15,160
Can the next witness come forward?

524
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,440
The defendant says
he was with you...

525
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,740
at the time the murder occurred.

526
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:33,710
But in the statement
you gave to the police,

527
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:37,309
you said you did not see him
on the day of the murder.

528
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,849
Is that correct?

529
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,349
Yes, that's right.

530
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:42,619
That's all.

531
00:29:43,619 --> 00:29:45,519
Defense, you may cross-examine.

532
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:52,000
I don't have any questions
right now.

533
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:56,569
What are you doing?

534
00:29:57,099 --> 00:29:58,470
It's called persuasion.

535
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:02,109
I'll make them prove your alibi
before the trial's over.

536
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,410
Don't worry.

537
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:05,740
Can I really trust you?

538
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:08,009
Please, be quiet.
Attorney Go In Du?

539
00:30:13,849 --> 00:30:15,119
I'm leaving.

540
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,160
Kang Ho Il, the witness.

541
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,700
Didn't you request he be brought in?

542
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,940
I did.

543
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,569
Why did you bring him in
if you won't ask questions?

544
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,880
You didn't request for
any other witnesses, did you?

545
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,980
You don't even have any evidence.

546
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,849
I really don't like
your attitude towards this case.

547
00:30:46,849 --> 00:30:48,349
I'm working on the evidence.

548
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,849
I'll submit whatever I find
when I find it.

549
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:05,000
The next hearing will be in
three days' time.

550
00:31:10,109 --> 00:31:11,109
Drink.

551
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,009
They say this is a tea
whose scent...

552
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:17,509
will last 100 years if it
gets infused into your clothes.

553
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,549
This smells lovely, Judge Cha.

554
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:23,220
Rather than the smell of tea,

555
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:26,220
I prefer the smell of money.

556
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,859
Prosecutor Kang.

557
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,359
Who did you get
your personality from?

558
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,500
Pardon?

559
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:34,299
Is that a compliment?

560
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:38,099
I worked really hard to help
this rookie prosecutor today.

561
00:31:40,769 --> 00:31:44,910
Attorney Go, you've been
working this district for 25 years.

562
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:48,079
I doubt you ever cut anyone slack.

563
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:51,079
Sometimes your modesty is annoying.

564
00:31:52,349 --> 00:31:54,779
I'll leave you to talk then.

565
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,089
Thank you for the tea, Judge Cha.

566
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,859
I'll look forward
to the next hearing.

567
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,230
Good luck.

568
00:32:14,369 --> 00:32:15,440
In Du,

569
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:17,910
what are you doing?

570
00:32:18,509 --> 00:32:19,910
Is this trial a joke to you?

571
00:32:20,009 --> 00:32:22,480
I'm only helping you
so that you can make...

572
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,450
an easy decision.

573
00:32:25,579 --> 00:32:26,819
Get down on your head.

574
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:30,519
Yes, ma'am.

575
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,230
Get up.

576
00:32:46,569 --> 00:32:49,240
You should've
at least put up an act.

577
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,910
What if your attitude
makes him switch lawyers?

578
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,680
I'm sorry.

579
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,750
You know very well
how I keep this court in order.

580
00:32:57,509 --> 00:33:00,119
Have you forgotten the old days...

581
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:01,480
now that you're better off?

582
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,690
- Is that it?
- No, ma'am.

583
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:06,589
Let me keep my pride
as the presiding judge.

584
00:33:06,589 --> 00:33:09,259
Don't make me look so pathetic.

585
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:12,700
I'll do better.

586
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:14,900
You can count on me.

587
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:21,039
What now?

588
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:23,069
Why are you back?

589
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:25,740
I told you
I'm not switching lawyers.

590
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,809
I enjoyed your trial,

591
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,710
but how can you say that?

592
00:33:32,779 --> 00:33:35,490
Someone was sentenced
to five years in prison...

593
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,490
for stealing
five bottles of sesame oil.

594
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,490
Meanwhile, a head of
an investment company...

595
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:42,789
led 27 people to suicide
by robbing them of their money,

596
00:33:42,859 --> 00:33:46,400
but he weaseled his way out
and only got probation.

597
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,460
- So what?
- Answer me this.

598
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:50,900
In these two cases,

599
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:54,339
was the judge bad
or was the lawyer incompetent?

600
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,170
Or could it be...

601
00:33:57,309 --> 00:34:00,240
the result of
a meticulously thought-out plan?

602
00:34:00,609 --> 00:34:01,809
"A plan"?

603
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:09,889
Watch this.

604
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:16,130
It's all going as planned.

605
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,389
He doesn't suspect at thing.

606
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:22,469
I'm only going to pretend
to represent him.

607
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:24,599
After he's found guilty,

608
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:27,699
I'll just say that
we'll win with an appeal.

609
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,969
He'll fold like paper.

610
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:32,980
So Chairman An, don't you worry.

611
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:38,409
So what if your lawyer
is the best closer in the city?

612
00:34:39,019 --> 00:34:41,019
He has no intention
of winning this case.

613
00:34:41,019 --> 00:34:42,389
Go In Du,

614
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,889
you pig.

615
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:45,559
You don't seem that surprised.

616
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,320
What?

617
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:49,190
Why you...

618
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,389
Who the heck are you?

619
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:54,960
It's safe to assume that
Chairman An is An Oh Ju.

620
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,730
But this is odd.

621
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:00,300
He could easily have you killed,

622
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,940
but he wants you in prison instead.

623
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:06,179
He must have a reason
to keep you alive.

624
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,449
I'll only say this.

625
00:35:10,179 --> 00:35:12,980
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

626
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,619
Here.

627
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:21,719
Please sign the contract.

628
00:35:22,929 --> 00:35:24,190
I'll be your legal representation.

629
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:26,460
Is this a plan too?

630
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:28,969
Are you after the money?

631
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,900
If not for money,
then why would a lawyer bother?

632
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:35,070
How much do you know
to get involved like this?

633
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:37,239
I'm more suspicious of you.

634
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:39,039
What are you really after?

635
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,679
My gosh.

636
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:46,050
I don't trust you,

637
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,750
so get lost.

638
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:02,300
- Right?
- Hey, get lost.

639
00:36:18,349 --> 00:36:19,420
That's hot.

640
00:36:44,539 --> 00:36:45,710
What's this?

641
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,179
- Are you all right?
- Stop him!

642
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,579
Guard!

643
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,710
Are you okay?

644
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,949
The letter was written on purpose.

645
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,880
I'm sure it means something.

646
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,050
Right?

647
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:57,889
What letter is it?

648
00:36:57,889 --> 00:36:59,860
Isn't it obvious?
It's a Chinese character.

649
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,820
- What an idiot.
- A Chinese character?

650
00:37:01,989 --> 00:37:03,730
Yes, but it's still only one letter.

651
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,460
What are you saying?

652
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,929
A lawyer should always fight
with the law.

653
00:37:08,929 --> 00:37:10,329
You should keep that in mind.

654
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:17,409
You don't trust your lawyer, do you?

655
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,869
What?

656
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,639
Why don't you trust
a local lawyer of this city?

657
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:24,380
Whether I trust him or not
is none of your business.

658
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,019
Get lost.

659
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:29,119
You applied for retirement
from the police force.

660
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,789
It's so that you can...

661
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:32,789
nurse your sick wife.

662
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,829
Right?

663
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,300
So what does this mean?

664
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,070
It means to fight.

665
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,469
I'm on a date with your mom.

666
00:37:45,469 --> 00:37:47,469
Then it means a lawyer...

667
00:37:47,469 --> 00:37:48,869
who fights.

668
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,219
Jae I.

669
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,389
I said I'd buy the house back...

670
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,800
after you pass the bar.

671
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,460
It's gotten too expensive.

672
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,000
We shouldn't have sold it back then.

673
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:20,869
I hear this area
will be redeveloped.

674
00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:23,010
It'll get even pricier then.

675
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:27,110
You only sold this place
because it reminded you of Mom.

676
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,579
Just keep the photo studio open.

677
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:38,750
It looks like it'll pour.

678
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:43,159
It also rained a lot that day.

679
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,840
Jae I,

680
00:38:55,269 --> 00:38:56,639
where are you off to?

681
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:58,139
To buy a harmonica.

682
00:38:58,139 --> 00:38:59,840
I need it for school tomorrow.

683
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:01,909
Then I'll go.

684
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:03,650
It's pouring outside.

685
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,650
I'll come with you.

686
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:08,880
No can do.
The stationery store is quite far.

687
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,289
I'll get one right now.
Your dad will be out soon,

688
00:39:12,289 --> 00:39:13,789
- okay?
- Okay.

689
00:39:13,789 --> 00:39:14,789
Give me a kiss.

690
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:19,500
Mom, hurry back.

691
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,960
I won't be long.

692
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,639
That was the last time I saw her.

693
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,610
I thought that I would be able
to find her...

694
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,420
if I became a prosecutor or lawyer.

695
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,090
Do you think she's still alive?

696
00:39:46,289 --> 00:39:48,019
Could she be miraculously alive?

697
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:52,260
I wish she would come back to us,
even if it's just her remains.

698
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:54,530
It's the last trace of her.

699
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,949
I heard what happened.

700
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,420
They say you almost died.

701
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:22,829
Can you guess who ordered the hit?

702
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:26,300
Who do you get
your information from?

703
00:40:27,699 --> 00:40:29,900
As a lawyer,
I have many clients here.

704
00:40:30,269 --> 00:40:32,329
Where people live, word travels.

705
00:40:32,769 --> 00:40:35,340
I'm warning you.
Don't seek me out again.

706
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,909
Aren't you going to switch lawyers?

707
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,469
Get lost already.

708
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:40,280
Your wife...

709
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:43,280
I heard she's in ICU now
and that she could die any day.

710
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,780
You have to get out of here
as soon as possible.

711
00:40:45,849 --> 00:40:47,050
You little...

712
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,420
Hey, how dare you!

713
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,289
Who are you, really?

714
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:51,989
Who put you up to this?

715
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:00,599
The scar on your arm...

716
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,699
Do you remember the kid
that gave you the scar?

717
00:41:04,099 --> 00:41:05,099
What?

718
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:08,539
Shouldn't a detective have
better memory?

719
00:41:10,269 --> 00:41:11,269
Or...

720
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:14,380
is it just something
that you don't want to remember?

721
00:41:15,579 --> 00:41:16,610
Then what about the woman?

722
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:18,480
Bury her with the kid.

723
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,820
Let go of me, you brat!

724
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,460
That female lawyer
you jerks killed...

725
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,730
I'm her son.

726
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,469
You're...

727
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:40,699
You're that lawyer's son?

728
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:44,710
As you can see.

729
00:41:47,909 --> 00:41:50,909
You said you want to know the real
reason why I want the case.

730
00:41:52,849 --> 00:41:53,920
I'm going to...

731
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:57,150
get you out of here so that
I can kill you with my own hands.

732
00:41:58,489 --> 00:42:00,789
I can't get my revenge
on a dead body, you know.

733
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,190
You're a complete lunatic.

734
00:42:06,659 --> 00:42:08,760
I'm going to make sure
you stay alive...

735
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,269
just so that I can kill you.

736
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:15,099
Not here.

737
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,340
Out of this place.

738
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,110
You... You little...

739
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,079
Officer, Officer...

740
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:42,300
(Ha's Photo Studio)

741
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,699
Stay inside, okay?

742
00:42:43,969 --> 00:42:45,429
I'll get the umbrella for us.

743
00:42:47,969 --> 00:42:48,969
Open the door.

744
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:51,170
- Come out.
- My gosh!

745
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:12,760
Bong Sang Pil.

746
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,360
Have you made up your mind?

747
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:16,230
I can't die here.

748
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:17,630
We can talk more when I'm out.

749
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:21,139
I want you to take my case.

750
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,570
You made the right decision.

751
00:43:25,539 --> 00:43:27,579
Then we'll do things my way
from now on.

752
00:43:27,579 --> 00:43:30,480
But are you... Are you 100 percent
sure that you can get me out?

753
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:33,320
Don't worry.

754
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,989
I'm willing to risk my everything
to make sure I get you out.

755
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:37,519
You know...

756
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:40,690
that I'll be a detective again
once I'm out of here, right?

757
00:43:43,659 --> 00:43:44,690
I guess that's true.

758
00:43:45,659 --> 00:43:48,130
You'd better keep your promise.

759
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:50,800
I have to get out of here.

760
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:54,769
You'll have to pay me
with your life.

761
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:25,670
(Daeho Stationary)

762
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,260
Mom.

763
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:54,829
Are you doing okay?

764
00:45:05,239 --> 00:45:06,780
Look at me.

765
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,809
Be brave.

766
00:45:11,449 --> 00:45:13,179
Be a brave boy.

767
00:45:13,849 --> 00:45:14,849
Gosh...

768
00:45:57,329 --> 00:45:58,989
Is this your office?

769
00:46:04,769 --> 00:46:06,739
And is this where Jin Ae died?

770
00:46:17,809 --> 00:46:19,079
Wu Hyung Man's trial...

771
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,349
I just got the case.

772
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:24,190
Really?

773
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:27,690
Will you be okay
with just Mr. Tae's help?

774
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:29,630
I'll bring a few guys
who can help you...

775
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:31,989
No, it's okay.

776
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:38,469
So is this the beginning?

777
00:46:40,139 --> 00:46:41,139
No.

778
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:46,409
It began 18 years ago.

779
00:46:48,909 --> 00:46:50,050
With my own hands...

780
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:56,920
I'll judge and punish those jerks
with my own two hands.

781
00:46:57,789 --> 00:47:00,559
- Sang Pil.
- Those scums who killed my mom...

782
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:03,659
All of them...

783
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:08,059
Every single one of them.

784
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,829
I'll get out
the ones that are in jail now,

785
00:47:13,139 --> 00:47:16,070
and I'll put those who aren't
locked up now behind bars,

786
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:17,809
with my hands.

787
00:47:19,809 --> 00:47:21,280
With my own two hands!

788
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:27,880
I'll be sure to give them
a real taste of misery.

789
00:47:32,289 --> 00:47:34,920
What brings you here at this hour?

790
00:47:35,389 --> 00:47:38,429
Wu Hyung Man got himself
a new lawyer.

791
00:47:38,429 --> 00:47:41,630
It looks like Bong Sang Pil will
defend him at the next trial.

792
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:45,269
They say that those who are
bound to be doomed...

793
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:48,469
can only come up with ideas
that would kill them.

794
00:47:52,309 --> 00:47:54,340
We can't let a cornered rat...

795
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:57,909
bite a cat.

796
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:00,579
Aren't I right?

797
00:48:03,849 --> 00:48:05,019
Hey.

798
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:07,059
Yes, Gwan Dong.

799
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:11,260
Let's work together on something.

800
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:16,400
I got the Wu Hyung Man case.
Meet me in court.

801
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:17,900
He got the case?

802
00:48:20,699 --> 00:48:22,599
Excuse me, Miss.
Can I ask you something?

803
00:48:23,239 --> 00:48:24,239
Pardon?

804
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:25,510
Yes. Aren't there too many pieces
of evidence? It's suspicious.

805
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:29,039
- Aren't you this guy's girlfriend?
- Sorry?

806
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:31,150
Why are you dating a guy like that?

807
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:33,050
It only got you in this mess.

808
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:35,380
What's going on?
Gosh, what are you doing now?

809
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,519
Who are you guys? Who are you...

810
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:39,150
No! Who are you guys?

811
00:48:40,019 --> 00:48:41,789
Let me go! You can't do this!

812
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:50,300
My gosh, being in court
is making me a bit nervous.

813
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,130
- Guys! He's here.
- There he is.

814
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:54,639
- Hello, Attorney Bong!
- Hello, Attorney Bong!

815
00:48:54,639 --> 00:48:56,670
I must say,
this isn't really a pleasant sight.

816
00:48:56,909 --> 00:48:58,039
I'm sorry.

817
00:48:58,039 --> 00:49:00,679
They wanted to watch
your first trial in the city.

818
00:49:02,909 --> 00:49:05,510
By the way, where's Ms. Ha?

819
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:07,250
The trial will begin in 20 minutes.

820
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:08,719
- Please enter the courtroom.
- My gosh!

821
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:10,750
- Let's go.
- Where did she go?

822
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:13,559
- Where are you going? It's here.
- Go in.

823
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:21,099
When will you get here?
The trial is about to start.

824
00:49:21,099 --> 00:49:22,699
Hey, Bong Sang Pil.

825
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:28,239
Can't you hear me?

826
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:31,239
Turn off the music!

827
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:34,880
Can you hear me now?

828
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,610
Your voice sounds familiar.

829
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:40,019
After you took my accountant away
from me,

830
00:49:40,949 --> 00:49:43,090
my business was immensely hindered.

831
00:49:43,219 --> 00:49:45,349
Why are you in Kiseong? And...

832
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:48,190
why do you have Ms. Ha's phone?

833
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:49,190
Right?

834
00:49:49,829 --> 00:49:52,230
Why do you think
I have your girlfriend's phone?

835
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:55,699
Miss, you tell him.

836
00:49:56,369 --> 00:49:57,400
Tell him that you're still alive.

837
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,269
Gosh, you worthless thugs...

838
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:01,969
You need to be taught a lesson!

839
00:50:02,139 --> 00:50:04,869
Bong Sang Pil!
I need to be compensated for this.

840
00:50:04,869 --> 00:50:06,010
Get the money ready.

841
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:09,039
I can tell that
it is my paralegal indeed.

842
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:11,349
You'd better get here immediately.

843
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:13,719
Every 10 minutes,

844
00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:17,150
your girlfriend will lose an organ
inside her body.

845
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:19,449
Do whatever you want.

846
00:50:26,829 --> 00:50:29,730
- What did you just say?
- She's not my girlfriend.

847
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,670
She's just a paralegal.

848
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:33,639
You picked the wrong hostage.

849
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,869
The trial will start now.

850
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,139
I have to go.

851
00:50:39,809 --> 00:50:40,909
Hey!

852
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:42,639
Aren't you Sang Pil's girlfriend?

853
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:43,679
What?

854
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:46,679
Why would I date him,
you moronic thug.

855
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:49,679
If you're going to kidnap someone,
do your homework first.

856
00:50:51,889 --> 00:50:52,889
Anyway,

857
00:50:54,019 --> 00:50:55,219
isn't he coming to get me?

858
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,760
He told me to do whatever I want.

859
00:50:56,889 --> 00:50:58,929
Bong Sang Pil, that disloyal jerk.

860
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:03,670
(Attorney Bong)

861
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:08,000
I see you're still a decent man,
seeing as to how you called me back.

862
00:51:08,369 --> 00:51:09,570
I've changed my mind.

863
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:11,869
The trial's about to start,

864
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:13,840
but you just ruined my mood.

865
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:15,780
Where are you?

866
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:20,280
What are you going to do?

867
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:24,449
Until I bring back Ms. Ha,

868
00:51:24,449 --> 00:51:26,989
don't let the trial begin. Okay?

869
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:30,190
You can count on us, sir.

870
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:54,420
How's it going?

871
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:58,550
Bong Sang Pil is on his way to you?

872
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:00,190
Yes, sir.

873
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:02,119
Tell him he has two options.

874
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:05,559
He can either forfeit the trial
or give up breathing all together.

875
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,630
I'll make him forfeit both.

876
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:10,630
I see that you're out for blood.

877
00:52:12,369 --> 00:52:15,469
I have your back,
so do whatever you want.

878
00:52:25,349 --> 00:52:28,250
You don't have
to teach anyone that...

879
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:30,550
scratching luxury cars
will bankrupt you.

880
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:34,119
However, there are still those
who don't know it's illegal...

881
00:52:34,119 --> 00:52:35,389
to kidnap and assault people.

882
00:52:35,389 --> 00:52:38,389
Look at you.
I see you've upped your style.

883
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,260
Who's your stylist?

884
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:42,099
You're dripping of swag.

885
00:52:42,099 --> 00:52:43,769
Then is your mom
the one who dressed you?

886
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:45,230
What, you jerk?

887
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:50,070
No lawyer would come all the way
here just to teach you a lesson.

888
00:52:53,809 --> 00:52:55,840
I can see she's still in good shape.

889
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:59,050
Did you forfeit the trial
to come here?

890
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:01,050
What could I do when...

891
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:03,079
my employee and debtor
is in trouble?

892
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:05,090
Also,

893
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:10,989
I didn't give up on the trial.

894
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,429
Judge Cha Moon Sook
will now enter.

895
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:17,630
All rise!

896
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,309
Please be seated.

897
00:53:29,909 --> 00:53:33,619
I heard the defendant
switched legal representation.

898
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:35,219
That's correct.

899
00:53:35,219 --> 00:53:37,920
Are you Attorney Bong Sang Pil?

900
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:39,650
No, it's not.

901
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,889
Attorney Bong left the courthouse...

902
00:53:42,889 --> 00:53:44,059
right before the trial started.

903
00:53:44,059 --> 00:53:45,760
Did you see him?

904
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:46,829
Where did he go?

905
00:53:46,829 --> 00:53:49,659
I guess he felt
too pressured to be here.

906
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:53,840
Where is Attorney Bong?

907
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,000
Well...

908
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,010
Please explain why
you're in his seat.

909
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:05,849
I'm his associate.

910
00:54:10,619 --> 00:54:12,949
Last time, you caught me off guard.

911
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,789
That's why I came prepared today.

912
00:54:16,389 --> 00:54:19,389
You should brace yourself
for what's to come.

913
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:23,530
Let me quote Mike Tyson.

914
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:26,639
"Everyone has a plan..."

915
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,039
"until..."

916
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:31,369
"they get punched in the mouth."

917
00:54:38,409 --> 00:54:40,119
You're his associate?

918
00:54:41,079 --> 00:54:44,389
Isn't the defendant only
being represented by Mr. Bong?

919
00:54:45,889 --> 00:54:46,960
You see...

920
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,820
I just joined as...

921
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:50,829
- Defendant!
- Yes?

922
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,059
Is that man telling the truth?

923
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:57,000
What? Well...

924
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,230
Article 112, Protocol 3
of the Attorneys-at-Law Act...

925
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:02,599
states that impersonating a lawyer
is a felony.

926
00:55:02,769 --> 00:55:04,570
Yes, I do know that!

927
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:14,449
That's the body of a gangster,
not a lawyer.

928
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:17,019
Are you really a lawyer?

929
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:19,650
Is this unidentifiable man...

930
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:21,659
pretending to be a lawyer?

931
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:24,789
Officers of the court,
please arrest him.

932
00:55:24,789 --> 00:55:26,760
- Defendant.
- Yes?

933
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,530
What are you doing?

934
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:30,599
Do you not care
if this is your last hearing?

935
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:32,000
That's not it, Your Honor.

936
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,739
Due to the absence
of the defendant's lawyer...

937
00:55:34,739 --> 00:55:36,940
Come on out! Where are you?

938
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:38,969
Where's that conman?

939
00:55:38,969 --> 00:55:39,969
Me?

940
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:41,909
Who else would I be talking about?

941
00:55:42,309 --> 00:55:44,849
I want my money back, you conman.

942
00:55:45,449 --> 00:55:48,550
Your Honor,
I'm killing this man today...

943
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:49,679
and going to jail!

944
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,849
You fraudulent jerk!

945
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:09,199
Quiet!

946
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:20,920
Listen to me!

947
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:22,949
Stop it!

948
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:27,019
You thug!

949
00:56:28,019 --> 00:56:29,559
Order!

950
00:56:46,139 --> 00:56:47,210
Are you all right?

951
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,110
Is this for real?
Are you really Sang Pil?

952
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:50,480
Yes, and I'm really a lawyer.

953
00:56:54,019 --> 00:56:55,179
Sang Pil!

954
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,659
Why you...

955
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:04,289
Let's go.

956
00:57:07,429 --> 00:57:09,000
You jerk!

957
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:11,769
"I'm on my way. Keep stalling."

958
00:57:14,199 --> 00:57:16,440
What do you think you're doing?

959
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,510
I want order in my courtroom!

960
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:21,210
If not,
I will hold you all in contempt.

961
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:22,409
Listen to me!

962
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:29,179
Move out of the way.

963
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:30,250
It'll be over soon.

964
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:31,820
- Who do you think you are?
- Are you a thug?

965
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:33,489
Please take a seat, Your Honor.

966
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,530
Do you have a death wish?

967
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:04,119
You don't have to thank me.

968
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,820
I only saved you because
I need your services.

969
00:58:09,289 --> 00:58:12,329
They took me because of you,
so of course you should come.

970
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:14,199
You don't have to be sorry.

971
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:16,329
You did save me after all.

972
00:58:16,829 --> 00:58:20,340
Besides, I wouldn't have
let them have their way.

973
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:32,150
She was stabbed with a knife too.

974
00:58:32,349 --> 00:58:34,320
It happened while she was
trying to defend herself!

975
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,380
Why are you just standing there?
Get her out of here.

976
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:39,119
It's not because I'm a woman.

977
00:58:39,789 --> 00:58:41,920
This verdict is wrong.

978
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:02,480
She looks like she was fired.

979
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,650
Hiring her as a partner
is out of the question then.

980
00:59:06,349 --> 00:59:07,719
Should I hire her as a paralegal?

981
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:11,590
I want loans collected
from all shoddy debtors.

982
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:14,090
- Right now?
- Yes.

983
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:15,820
This one is especially bad.

984
00:59:16,389 --> 00:59:17,590
Ha's Photo Studio.

985
00:59:17,789 --> 00:59:19,960
Ha's Photo Studio? Yes, sir.

986
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:28,440
You little brat. You're so dead.

987
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:35,110
Run.

988
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:36,440
Let go of me!

989
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:37,510
You...

990
00:59:38,309 --> 00:59:39,480
- My leg!
- Hurry!

991
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:44,250
(Ha's Photo Studio)

992
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:45,849
What happened to my mom...

993
00:59:47,789 --> 00:59:49,559
happened to yours too.

994
00:59:52,489 --> 00:59:53,760
What are you looking at?

995
00:59:57,099 --> 00:59:58,199
This fight...

996
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:01,239
will become yours and mine.

997
01:00:02,539 --> 01:00:03,639
What fight?

998
01:00:03,869 --> 01:00:05,170
Are you talking about the trial?

999
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:09,440
Sure.

1000
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,679
Step on it before it's too late.

1001
01:00:14,119 --> 01:00:16,349
Hey! Come at me!

1002
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:21,559
You thugs!

1003
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,320
What are you doing...

1004
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:26,360
in a sacred court of law?

1005
01:00:51,519 --> 01:00:52,989
Where are you?

1006
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:55,960
I found it.

1007
01:00:57,730 --> 01:00:59,659
What would you like me to do
about the lawyer and her son?

1008
01:01:01,329 --> 01:01:02,860
Kill them both.

1009
01:01:06,099 --> 01:01:07,869
I don't trust the living.

1010
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:39,099
Who are you?

1011
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:44,440
I am Attorney Bong Sang Pil.

1012
01:01:47,309 --> 01:01:50,550
The trial begins now.

1013
01:01:54,579 --> 01:01:56,079
Judge Cha Moon Sook.

1014
01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:16,269
(Lawless Lawyer)

1015
01:02:17,369 --> 01:02:20,369
Beware of people who use your trust.

1016
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,780
I trust you, Ha Jae I.

1017
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:27,519
I think that lawyers
are people who fight prejudice.

1018
01:02:27,519 --> 01:02:30,519
Isn't Chairman An Oh Ju
involved in the mayor's death?

1019
01:02:30,519 --> 01:02:32,519
Have you heard of "The Golden City"?

1020
01:02:32,519 --> 01:02:35,690
Don't you smell
the stench of crime already?

1021
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:40,289
I am so sorry.

1022
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:42,400
Where should I start explaining,

1023
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:44,329
Ha Jae I?
