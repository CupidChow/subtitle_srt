- Go, An Oh Ju!
- Go, An Oh Ju!

9
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:40,810
The honorable people of Kiseong,

10
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:45,579
this election is a victory for you.

11
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:49,390
As the mayor of the people,

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,789
I will make sure that
all of your dreams come true.

13
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,460
I, An Oh Ju,
will bring you hope and happiness...

14
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,500
He just swallowed up Kiseong.

15
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,539
Lee Young Soo was a member
of The Seven too.

16
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,400
So it doesn't really matter
which one's the mayor.

17
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,069
Lee Young Soo walked on
eggshells around Judge Cha,

18
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,109
but he didn't obey her all the time.

19
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:12,909
Is An Oh Ju different?

20
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,019
That's right. He'll give her
the master key to Kiseong.

21
00:01:17,019 --> 00:01:19,019
So Cha Moon Sook
swallowed up Kiseong,

22
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,519
not An Oh Ju.

23
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,219
Our way up now
is through Wu Hyung Man.

24
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:28,230
Is that why you referred
to him as the key?

25
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,230
Yes.

26
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:32,530
I bet he has something
that will wring...

27
00:01:32,629 --> 00:01:34,069
An Oh Ju by the neck.

28
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:38,099
If that's why An Oh Ju
kept Wu Hyung Man alive,

29
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,969
once that's gone...

30
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:42,909
He'll kill Wu Hyung Man.

31
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,480
Attorney Bong,

32
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:47,379
we should go to
Wu Hyung Man right now.

33
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,480
Sure, let's go.

34
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,450
You two will be our backup.

35
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,120
Don't you mean, you three?

36
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,150
Yes, you three. Carry on.

37
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,159
(Letter of Resignation)

38
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:58,760
What's this?

39
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,230
Is this really necessary?

40
00:02:01,629 --> 00:02:02,659
Hyung Man!

41
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,260
I'm too ashamed to
work with my colleagues.

42
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,560
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:09,169
Unbelievable.

44
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,580
Take care.

45
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,349
Mayor An Oh Ju starts his term by...

46
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:25,180
visiting Kiseong District Court.

47
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,990
From a land of crap,
you finally rose to the top.

48
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:32,389
I'll make sure
you take a nose-dive down.

49
00:02:32,389 --> 00:02:35,360
Your first order of business
was to visit Kiseong District Court.

50
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,490
Is there a reason for that?

51
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,199
If you wish to know the answer,

52
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,530
please keep on following.

53
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,000
I'll tell you in front of Judge Cha.

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,569
I'm Reporter Yu Kyeong Jin
of TVG News.

55
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:47,310
You promised to transfer
Ohju Group to a blind trust.

56
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,370
Will you keep that promise?

57
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:52,240
Most people change their words
after they get what they want,

58
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,310
but that's no attitude of a mayor.

59
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:57,750
I'm not just a citizen.
I'm the mayor of this city now.

60
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:00,889
I already made
a promise to the people,

61
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,250
and it's already being carried out.

62
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:06,120
I'm saying that
legal actions are being taken.

63
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,430
Like most former
or present high officials,

64
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,000
you could just be playing us.

65
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:20,240
Someone virtuous and worthy...

66
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,870
will take over Ohju Group.

67
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:24,379
Does that answer your question?

68
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,210
- I have one more.
- That's enough.

69
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,310
Mr. Mayor.

70
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,379
Mr. Mayor!

71
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,449
Who is that cheeky wench?

72
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:33,180
Call her office.

73
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,189
Tell them how rude she was to me.

74
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,120
- Yes, sir.
- Call them immediately.

75
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,960
- Mr. Mayor.
- Mr. Mayor!

76
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,229
My goodness.

77
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,169
Judge Cha.

78
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,569
Congratulations, Mayor An.

79
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:51,669
- Goodness me.
- This way, ma'am!

80
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:53,069
- A photo, sir!
- Congratulations.

81
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:56,870
I can't believe Judge Cha
came here to greet me.

82
00:03:57,009 --> 00:04:00,039
It's nothing but a great honor.

83
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:05,120
What are your visions
for the city of Kiseong?

84
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,879
I promise you this...

85
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,789
in front of you,

86
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:13,090
the statue of Lady Justice,

87
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:17,629
and of course, the statue
of Judge Cha Byung Ho.

88
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,300
Law-abiding city, Kiseong.

89
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,930
I'll be a mayor worthy of it.

90
00:04:23,569 --> 00:04:27,470
I promise you that
I'll be a mayor who operates...

91
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,670
within the law.

92
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,649
- That's great, sir!
- Look over here!

93
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:36,879
Hearing you say that reassures me.

94
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,180
I'll do my very best to help you...

95
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,649
keep that promise.

96
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,959
I'll do my best too. Thank you.

97
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:49,560
- Over here!
- A photo, please!

98
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,300
- This way!
- Sir!

99
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,670
Was that speech prepared?

100
00:04:56,769 --> 00:05:00,910
From now on,
I'll follow your orders to a tee.

101
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,310
That's what I mean.

102
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,240
I'm expecting a lot from you,
Mayor An.

103
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:07,910
Well...

104
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,980
About Ohju Group's blind trust...

105
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,149
Everything is going smoothly
without any problems, right?

106
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:15,750
Like you suggested,

107
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,360
The president of the bank,
Son Sung Sik,

108
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,829
will sell his shares...

109
00:05:20,829 --> 00:05:24,629
and join Ohju Group as CEO.

110
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:31,100
(Execution Plan
for Ohju Group's Blind Trust)

111
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,740
All right.

112
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,399
Honey.

113
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,769
I did all sorts of bad things...

114
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,410
to make sure
you wouldn't have to die.

115
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:09,810
But now that I've made up my mind
to be a better man,

116
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,980
you're leaving me like this.

117
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,069
Let me ask you one thing,
Bong Sang Pil.

118
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,740
How did you manage to survive
18 years ago?

119
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:44,939
You were only 10 back then.

120
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,680
My maternal uncle helped me.

121
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,019
Maternal uncle...

122
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:55,449
Then he must know
everything as well.

123
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,660
Don't follow me.

124
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,189
It could get both of you in danger.

125
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:05,629
You're...

126
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:08,029
the one in danger now.

127
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:13,100
An Oh Ju is after you.

128
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,870
Thank you,

129
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:18,810
Attorney Ha Jae I,

130
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:21,779
for your concern.

131
00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:34,529
What's he trying to do?

132
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:37,660
His wife died,
and he quit his job as a detective.

133
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,930
There's nothing he can do now.

134
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:41,970
Wrong. It's actually the opposite.

135
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,370
He can do anything now
because he has nothing to lose.

136
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,639
And An Oh Ju is well aware of it.

137
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,579
- Are we being tailed?
- Yes.

138
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,180
They've been
tailing us since earlier.

139
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,620
Make sure Wu Hyung Man
can get away, Sang Pil.

140
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,790
Yes, ma'am! I'll do as you say.

141
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,189
Gosh, Bong Sang Pil...
Get ahead of them.

142
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:21,040
You idiot! How could you
let him get away like that?

143
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:23,639
- Hey, Seok Gwan Dong!
- Bong Sang Pil...

144
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:24,709
Attorney Bong, get him.

145
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:26,639
Move the car.
You're not going to move it?

146
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,149
- Then move our car, you idiot.
- Seok Gwan Dong!

147
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:31,620
That jerk.

148
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,360
You prepared a plan B for
a situation like this, didn't you?

149
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,220
Gosh, Ha Jae I. You must be
thinking about me a lot these days.

150
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,289
You know me so well now.

151
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:43,129
I've been in a situation
like this many times.

152
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:45,929
Hey, whereabouts is he now?

153
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,129
Wu Hyung Man is
in the outskirts of Kiseong now.

154
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,639
- He's left Kiseong?
- Yes, I'll send you his location.

155
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:53,570
- Don't lose him.
- I won't, Boss.

156
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:56,509
When did you plant a tracking device
on Wu Hyung Man's phone?

157
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,309
Don't click on any
text messages that says...

158
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:00,580
they'll give something for free.

159
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:05,049
Things like spam messages
and hacking scare me the most.

160
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,850
I don't want anyone
to spy on my phone.

161
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,289
I know, right?

162
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:10,919
Let's focus. If we lose him,
many people will get hurt.

163
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,789
Yes, sir.

164
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,460
You'll learn
why Boss tried so hard...

165
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:17,759
to get Wu Hyung Man out.

166
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:19,129
Okay.

167
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,070
Here. He's here now.

168
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,480
Are you running away because
you don't want to pay me?

169
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,750
Of course, not.

170
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:39,620
I won't do that because
you saved my life.

171
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,990
Good. Make sure
you pay me in full.

172
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:44,419
Wu Hyung Man.

173
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,090
Don't delude yourself and think that
you're only indebted to Sang Pil.

174
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,759
Don't delude myself?

175
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:58,899
Stop right there.

176
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:04,139
Please don't kill me.

177
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:06,509
I have a daughter.

178
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,580
She's only eight years old.

179
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,250
Please let me live.

180
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,919
Please... Please don't kill me.

181
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,919
I have to go home.

182
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,059
I can't die like this.

183
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:22,730
You have to die for me to live.

184
00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:25,230
Please... Detective.

185
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:28,929
Please, I beg you.

186
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,769
Please...

187
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,240
Get up.

188
00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:45,320
Get up now!

189
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,389
Now, I want you gone.

190
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:55,659
Go on. Disappear forever!

191
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:59,159
What do you mean...

192
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,399
If you show up again,

193
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,700
I'll kill your daughter first.

194
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:05,399
Right in front of your eyes!

195
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:09,110
I'll make arrangements so that
you can leave by boat,

196
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:10,980
so you must leave tonight.

197
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:17,379
If you don't do as I say,
I'll kill your whole family.

198
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,220
Don't ever forget that.

199
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:25,389
Live quietly like a dead person.

200
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:30,129
That's what you can do
to make sure your family can live.

206
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,490
I was born as an orphan,

207
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,230
and I gave myself my name.

208
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,639
I grew up in the gutter,

209
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,799
and it took me 28 years...

210
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,409
to make the fish market mine.

211
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,309
After that, it took me
another 10 years...

212
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,250
to make Ohju Group mine.

Mr. Mayor.

00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:55,240
We lost Wu Hyung Man. I'm sorry.

217
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,120
I'll find him no matter what.

218
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,769
Tell the guys to come back.

219
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,440
And you don't need to
tail him either.

220
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:36,809
- Pardon me?
- Wu Hyung Man's...

221
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,549
target is me.

222
00:14:42,789 --> 00:14:45,460
He'll eventually
walk in here himself anyway.

223
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,299
Yes. Are you sure he's here?

224
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,000
Yes. The signals from his phone
stopped there.

225
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:56,470
All right.

226
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,970
This is a long-term parking lot.

227
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:00,740
Why did he come here?

228
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,919

for helping me prove my innocence.

Wu Hyung Man.

232

This is for you, Ms. Ha,
not Bong Sang Pil.

233
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,289
It's for you.

234
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:50,750
You probably know this,

235
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,289
but An Oh Ju won't be
easy to bring down.

236
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:56,389
What's in the box
will help you get started though.

237

Where are you?

238
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,960
Lastly, Ms. Ha,

239
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,600
I'll tell you one more thing.

240
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,870
I...

241
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:08,639
am in no debt to you.

242
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,210
What?

243
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,120
Attorney Bong,

244
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:26,490
look at this.

245
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,429
After I was elected as mayor,

246
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:40,100
I've been invited
to countless dinners.

247
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,110
Do you know why I chose
to come back here though?

248
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:45,610
Do you?

249
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,009
Judge Cha Byung Ho,

250
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:54,179
I used to be...

251
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,389
more useless than
a fly on your back,

252
00:16:57,019 --> 00:16:59,990
but now I'm the mayor of Kiseong.

253
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,630
My dream...

254
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,400
is to have a photo of myself
up on this wall too.

255
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:36,359
Ma'am, would you
give us some privacy?

256
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:45,700
You worthless thug.

257
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:50,769
It's astonishing how
you can eat at this time.

258
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:53,140
I'm sorry about your wife.

259
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:56,509
I was busy with
the campaign that...

260
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,990
Hey, hey. Come on.

261
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:05,190
Can't you see I'm eating here?
Get it out of my face!

262
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,289
Unbelievable.

263
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:11,930
Hold on.

264
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,700
I recognize this.

265
00:18:16,099 --> 00:18:19,799
It's the gun that
I gave to you years ago.

266
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:22,039
You have good memory.

267
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:26,240
I told you to kill
Bong Sang Pil and the woman...

268
00:18:27,579 --> 00:18:33,079
and bury the gun in the ground.

269
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:36,890
It's a good thing
I kept it though, isn't it?

270
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,089
You're dying by my hands today.

271
00:18:41,089 --> 00:18:42,259
Look,

272
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,599
you won't shoot me.

273
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:45,730
I will.

274
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:48,730
Today, I will...

275
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:49,799
Hyung Man...

276
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:53,500
Pull the trigger then!

277
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:57,440
Just like you did 18 years go!

278
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,579
- Shoot!
- Why you...

279
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,079
Hyung Man,

280
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,720
it seems like your time in prison
weakened you.

281
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,029
You're unbelievable.

282
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:19,430
No matter how angry you are at me,

283
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,130
you can't point the gun...

284
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,470
that I gave you...

285
00:19:25,069 --> 00:19:26,970
back at me!

286
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,170
Jerk!

287
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:37,009
I see you were serious
about killing me.

288
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:45,759
These are the files
we have on An Oh Ju.

289
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,559
- All of these?
- Yes.

290
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:50,559
We need to find something
to arrest him with. Okay?

291
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,430
- Yes, sir.
- Sure.

292
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,230
My gosh, this is a lot.

293
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:56,069
- Start looking.
- I will.

294
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,799
- Here, Geum Kang.
- Yes, sir.

295
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,940
- Here, Geum Ja.
- Gosh.

296
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,910
These doesn't seem to match.

297
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,650
Keep things in order.

298
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,160
Yes, sir.

299
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:22,559
- Geum Ja.
- Yes?

300
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,859
Can I get a copy of this?

301
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:26,059
- Keep looking!
- Yes, sir.

302
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:28,500
Ms. Ha, do you have anything?

303
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,329
Nearly all of them...

304
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,240
are hard to prove or statute barred.

305
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,640
Keep looking.

306
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,740
Sure.

307
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,980
Keep it up, you guys.

308
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,240
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir!

309
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,079
Look at this.

310
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,009
Starting from futures trading.

311
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:46,779
They are caught.

312
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:51,920
- Sir.
- What?

313
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:54,519
Don't!

314
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:03,599
Don't you think there's
something going on between...

315
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,970
Attorney Bong and Ms. Ha?

316
00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:07,269
What are you talking about?

317
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,740
- Do your work.
- Is this your way of...

318
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,740
getting out of work?

319
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,680
Thanks.

320
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,009
What if something's really going on?

321
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:24,049
Attention, everyone.

322
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:28,529
This man here is...

323
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,599
Son Sung Sik, the president
of Kiseong Savings Bank.

324
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,670
He's An Oh Ju's safekeeper.

325
00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:36,730
Since An Oh Ju was elected mayor,

326
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,140
he has to sell...

327
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,670
his Ohju Group shares due to
the public servant's ethics code.

328
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:43,309
Son Sung Sik is the one...

329
00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:45,809
who'll help with the blind trust.

330
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:48,380
- Okay?
- In that short period of time,

331
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,509
you managed to crack the puzzle.

332
00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:50,549
Mr. Tae.

333
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,420
Did you locate Wu Hyung Man?

334
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:58,089
I lost him after
he got a burner phone.

335
00:21:59,059 --> 00:22:00,359
What if something happened to him?

336
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,930
We need to chase An Oh Ju.

337
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,599
Where An Oh Ju is,
Wu Hyung Man will be there.

338
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,000
Yes, sir. I'll get right on it.

339
00:22:30,089 --> 00:22:31,390
Gosh, it's so funny.

340
00:22:31,589 --> 00:22:33,220
Congratulations!

341
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,359
Please, that's enough.

342
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,099
- Goodness.
- Here's to celebrate.

343
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,069
- Thank you.
- Mayor An.

344
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:49,569
Let's drink.

345
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:50,769
Thank you, everyone.

346
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:53,180
Congratulations.

347
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:56,509
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

348
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:59,680
Mr. Chief Prosecutor.

349
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:02,789
I don't know if
I should be accepting...

350
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:05,289
the new mayor's first pour.

351
00:23:06,859 --> 00:23:09,329
Feel free to call me
if you need my help.

352
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:13,230
Did you know that
I've always wanted to...

353
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:15,299
hear you say that?

354
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:16,599
The drink couldn't be sweeter.

355
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,640
Editor-in-chief Han,

356
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,609
I heard you helped immensely
with the election.

357
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:25,109
You flatter me, ma'am.

358
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:29,579
I only reported the facts
about Mayor An's venture.

359
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,250
Right.

360
00:23:31,819 --> 00:23:33,150
Mayor An, make your announcement.

361
00:23:33,349 --> 00:23:34,519
Should I?

362
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,890
All right then.

363
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:41,190
I'd like to make
a special announcement.

364
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:44,930
Just as I promised,

365
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,000
the shares of Ohju Group
that I own will be...

366
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,339
transferred to a blind trust.

367
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,009
The person...

368
00:23:55,940 --> 00:24:00,980
who will take over
Ohju Group for me is...

369
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,279
President Son Sung Sik.

370
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,289
Thank you.

371
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,190
Thank you.

372
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,660
I know the hard work
you put into it,

373
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,089
so I'll do my best...

374
00:24:15,089 --> 00:24:17,859
to maintain its business
until you return.

375
00:24:17,859 --> 00:24:22,230
What if Mayor An
makes it to parliament?

376
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:25,039
Well, that's good news for me.

377
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,599
It is good for me too.

378
00:24:30,009 --> 00:24:31,740
That's quite
a big decision you made.

379
00:24:32,009 --> 00:24:34,849
Now, I don't even have...

380
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:37,410
a single penny in my pocket.

381
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:40,650
How happy about that are you?

382
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,789
It's a great day today,
so let's drink.

383
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:50,859
Yes, let's.

384
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:55,269
For Mayor An Oh Ju!

385
00:24:55,569 --> 00:24:57,400
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

386
00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:00,500
(Mayor An Oh Ju, congratulations
on winning the election.)

387
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:06,779
Yeon Hee.

388
00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:11,009
I can't stand that
he's the new mayor.

389
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,579
He keeps his word though.

390
00:25:14,349 --> 00:25:16,950
Judge Cha talked to
the chief prosecutor...

391
00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:18,619
and sorted things out.

392
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:21,890
My job was almost on the line
because of an investigator.

393
00:25:24,029 --> 00:25:25,529
I'm done with that now.

394
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:28,329
Investigator Min deceived you.

395
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:32,869
I bet that someone was behind that.

396
00:25:33,369 --> 00:25:35,109
I'll find who that was and...

397
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,670
It doesn't matter.

398
00:25:37,309 --> 00:25:38,309
What?

399
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:40,579
Whether it's An Oh Ju
or someone else,

400
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,349
I'll use that person to get higher.

401
00:25:44,349 --> 00:25:45,579
Like Judge Cha.

402
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,450
Yeon Hee.

403
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,789
If you're going to aim high,

404
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,029
why not go higher than Judge Cha?

405
00:25:57,289 --> 00:26:00,230
I'll stay here and back you up.

406
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,569
Until you beat her.

407
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:07,170
- Madam Nam.
- Yes, judge.

408
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,009
Do you need something?

409
00:26:09,009 --> 00:26:11,680
- I'm tired.
- I'll take you home.

410
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,140
You do that.

411
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,779
We'll wrap things up without you.

412
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:17,009
Goodbye.

413
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,380
(Kiseong Savings Bank)

414
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:21,990
Last February,
K Trust went bankrupt.

415
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:25,420
When it was a month old
and had no patents,

416
00:26:25,589 --> 00:26:28,259
Kiseong Savings Bank
loaned the company 50 billion.

417
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:30,359
I remember reading about it online.

418
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,400
It was the bank's recommended
investment options,

419
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,670
so a ton of
Kiseong people invested.

420
00:26:35,869 --> 00:26:37,829
It disrupted our
loan shark industry too.

421
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:39,039
- Yes.
- That's right.

422
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:43,369
Yes. 10 billion of that money
belonged to the public.

423
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:46,180
They forced me
to pay the interest,

424
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:47,710
but they lost 50 billion?

425
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:51,250
K Trust is a paper company
connected to Ohju Group.

426
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,890
The bankruptcy was planned
to gather a slush fund to...

427
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,349
prepare for the blind trust.

428
00:26:58,019 --> 00:27:01,259
An Oh Ju is a real loan shark.

429
00:27:03,259 --> 00:27:05,230
We have to go after Son Sung Sik.

430
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:07,400
If we expose the planned bankruptcy,

431
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,970
we can get to An Oh Ju's slush fund.

432
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:12,400
Do you think we can manage?

433
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,009
Of course, we can't.
That's why we need help.

434
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:19,880
Here.

435
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,049
Prosecutor Cheon Seung Beom?

436
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:25,779
- Who's he?
- No. I object.

437
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:29,650
Do you ever object to Attorney Bong?

438
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,089
You can't go to him.

439
00:27:31,289 --> 00:27:33,519
You know how much
he made you suffer.

440
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:37,329
That's why I want to turn
the bad karma into good.

441
00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:38,859
Bad karma?

442
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:42,200
He's the prosecutor
who put me in prison.

443
00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:46,240
(Prosecutor Cheon Seung Beom
is Disciplined)

444
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,170
Here is the sentence.
Aggravated violence, not guilty.

445
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,509
Intimidation and blackmail,
not guilty.

446
00:27:58,279 --> 00:27:59,920
Lack of evidence?

447
00:28:00,849 --> 00:28:03,619
Letting people go and
patting each other's backs.

448
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,619
The world lacks laughter.

449
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:10,460
Korea's court of law is a farce.

450
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,730
You're just the same.

451
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,470
I'm Bong Sang Pil.

452
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:17,400
It is a farce.

453
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:19,599
I heard you'd become an attorney.

454
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,740
What do you want?

455
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,170
Thanks to you,

456
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:25,210
I became an attorney
who feels my clients' pain.

457
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:27,680
You came to tell me that
you changed your life around?

458
00:28:28,579 --> 00:28:30,250
I came to give you a gift.

459
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,710
If it's not worth it,

460
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:34,519
I'll lock you back up
for attempted solicitation.

461
00:28:38,289 --> 00:28:39,859
It's a deliberate bankruptcy.

462
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,460
How can I trust you
and the paperwork you give me?

463
00:28:44,029 --> 00:28:46,230
You can go around
saying you're an attorney,

464
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,200
but to me you're just
a thug who knows the law.

465
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,569
Don't trust me. Trust those papers.

466
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,140
You don't believe the truth,

467
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,240
but you believe facts and numbers.

468
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:02,650
Come to Kiseong,
the land of the lawless.

469
00:29:13,289 --> 00:29:15,359
Yu Kyeong Jin, a TVG reporter.

470
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:17,890
She's acknowledged to be
the best investigative journalist.

471
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:20,900
Once she bites, she never let go
until he sees blood.

472
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:22,930
They call her a Jindo dog.

473
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,269
The blood's either hers
or her subject's?

474
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,670
Yes, I'm in the lobby.

475
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,750
- Are you reporter Yu Kyeong Jin?
- Yes.

476
00:29:37,349 --> 00:29:38,720
I'm Attorney Ha Jae I.

477
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,480
What do you want?

478
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,519
I have a story for you.

479
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:47,089
An Oh Ju kicked off
his official duties...

480
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:48,789
with a visit to
Kiseong District Court.

481
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:50,960
Here's his interview.

482
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,430
Why did you chose to visit
Kiseong District Court...

483
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,759
as your first order of business?

484
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:59,039
If you wish to know the answer,
please keep on following.

485
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,400
I'll tell you in front of
Judge Cha Moon Sook.

486
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,009
I'm Reporter Yu Kyeong Jin
of TVG News.

487
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:05,640
You promised to transfer
Ohju Group to a blind trust.

488
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,740
Will you keep that promise?

489
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,480
Kwang Soo, pull up the news on...

490
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,079
An Oh Ju's visit to
Kiseong District Court.

491
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:12,380
Yes, sir. It's on screen.

492
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,519
Here's his interview.

493
00:30:15,849 --> 00:30:17,250
Seok Gwan Dong's
not next to him, is he?

494
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,890
If you wish to know the answer...

495
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:20,720
He's not there.

496
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:22,589
There's just his minion.

497
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:24,859
Locate Seok Gwan Dong.

498
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:26,099
- Okay, sir.
- Okay.

499
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:33,569
That's today's list of
borrowed name accounts.

500
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,839
Yoon Soo, Yeong Cheol, Na Ri.

501
00:30:38,509 --> 00:30:39,680
What's this?

502
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,380
One account is missing.

503
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,980
What happened?

504
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,450
That's because...

505
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:49,519
an orphan, who had leukemia,

506
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:52,259
passed away.

507
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:53,660
Who's that?

508
00:30:54,259 --> 00:30:55,390
I don't know.

509
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,160
Find out who that kid is...

510
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,200
and erase all trace of the account.

511
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,599
And look for more orphans.

512
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:05,170
Sure. I'll do as you say.

513
00:31:11,509 --> 00:31:14,839
It's not about the ride,
it's about how you look getting out.

514
00:31:15,849 --> 00:31:17,579
Congratulations, Mayor.

515
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:20,049
My goodness, thank you so much.

516
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:22,950
Thank you. Thank you all.

517
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,589
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

518
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,990
Congratulations.

519
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,470
The weather is extra clear
and bright today.

520
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:40,470
The view of Kiseong
from the steps of City Hall...

521
00:31:41,339 --> 00:31:42,470
is awesome.

522
00:31:43,369 --> 00:31:44,640
Do help me out.

523
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:46,680
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

524
00:31:55,549 --> 00:31:56,549
Hello?

525
00:31:56,849 --> 00:31:59,519
Mayor An. I have bad news.

526
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,859
Oh dear. What's the fuss about?

527
00:32:02,029 --> 00:32:05,599
Is it a bigger deal than
me becoming mayor?

528
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:07,400
The thing is...

529
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:11,599
Don't you watch TV?

530
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:14,400
The Prosecutors' Office carried out
a search and seizure warrant...

531
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,009
against Kiseong Savings Bank.

532
00:32:16,539 --> 00:32:19,309
In regards to the K Trust
loan scam that...

533
00:32:19,309 --> 00:32:22,549
Kiseong Savings Bank
operated last February,

534
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:25,380
the prosecutors received
a very convincing tip.

535
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:29,720
They identified Son Sung Sik
as someone deeply involved...

536
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,460
and will now focus on
tracing the money.

537
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,859
This is Yu Kyeong Jin from TVG News.

538
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,660
(Kiseong District
Public Prosecutor's Office)

539
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,369
Come to Kiseong,

540
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,470
the land of the lawless.

541
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:52,210
You need to transfer soon anyway.

542
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:53,779
Did you do background check on me?

543
00:32:54,309 --> 00:32:55,680
You're too brazen.

544
00:32:56,009 --> 00:32:58,920
There's a lot to eat in Kiseong.

545
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:00,480
A deliberate bankruptcy?

546
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,349
I'm not interested in people
who play with money.

547
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:06,720
It started off with money,

548
00:33:07,259 --> 00:33:09,190
but how far up it goes...

549
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:11,190
is utterly in your hands.

550
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:23,440
I'm Prosecutor Cheon Seung Beom.

551
00:33:23,539 --> 00:33:24,769
I'm Gong Jang Soo.

552
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:29,279
I'm so glad to have
a veteran detective by my side.

553
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,980
Is it your first time
as an investigator?

554
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:34,819
Yes, it is.

555
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:38,890
May I ask why
you wanted to work with...

556
00:33:39,789 --> 00:33:42,490
someone as useless as me?

557
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:43,589
Someone recommended you.

558
00:33:44,529 --> 00:33:46,059
What? Me?

559
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,400
Who was that?

560
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,299
It's our secret.

561
00:33:50,369 --> 00:33:52,670
Sorry. I'm good at keeping secrets.

562
00:33:52,869 --> 00:33:53,940
I understand.

563
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,869
Let's start off by interrogating...

564
00:33:57,539 --> 00:33:59,640
President Son Sung Sik.

565
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,240
Yes, sir.

566
00:34:02,849 --> 00:34:03,910
Let's go, Mr. Prosecutor.

567
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:08,750
You're so impressive, sir.

568
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:12,389
They were just some bad loans.

569
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:16,130
An inexperienced bank teller...

570
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:18,489
You'll blame it all on
a rookie's mistake?

571
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,829
The bank teller
killed himself, right?

572
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:25,670
You won't last long
if you go on like this.

573
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:30,170
PTJ, Gentrion, Y-Tree.

574
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:32,239
Are all these a rookie's mistake?

575
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:35,650
Ever since you retired as
Ohju Group's CFO...

576
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,909
and moved to Kiseong Savings Bank,

577
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:41,320
so many companies in Kiseong
went bankrupt. Why?

578
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,920
That's... That's just...

579
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,760
Mayor An's involved, isn't he?

580
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,230
No. He is not.

581
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:51,829
PTJ's bankruptcy
is linked to his campaign funds.

582
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:55,230
K Trust is linked to
the buy-up of his shares.

583
00:34:55,769 --> 00:34:57,469
That's all wrong.

584
00:34:57,869 --> 00:35:00,000
Please believe me.

585
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:01,900
I don't trust anybody.

586
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:07,510
In this corrupt world, I don't trust
anything but numbers and facts.

587
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,750
I bet An Oh Ju is already
working on getting rid of you.

588
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,190
Shall I give you a word of advice?

589
00:35:19,489 --> 00:35:20,860
A hound that has no hare to chase...

590
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:23,159
must bite the hunter
before it gets killed.

591
00:35:36,739 --> 00:35:37,739
You.

592
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:41,679
You know who I am, don't you?

593
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:43,909
Yes, I do.

594
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,719
You're Prosecutor Kang's mother.

595
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:50,519
So you did that,
fully knowing who I am.

596
00:35:52,889 --> 00:35:55,630
How dare you fool my daughter?

597
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:02,670
Who put you up to it?

598
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,130
Nobody. I did it alone.

599
00:36:05,699 --> 00:36:07,670
Are you really capable enough...

600
00:36:07,969 --> 00:36:09,269
to do something like that alone?

601
00:36:10,409 --> 00:36:11,539
I really did it alone.

602
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:13,139
Did An Oh Ju order you to do it?

603
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,110
No. No, he didn't.

604
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:19,679
If you...

605
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,650
don't want to end up
with crippled legs,

606
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,789
you'd better tell me this instant!

607
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,260
Who leaked the information
on the president of the bank?

608
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,230
Is there anyone specific
that comes to mind?

609
00:36:35,969 --> 00:36:38,500
I'll sort out the situation.

610
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,000
About the blind trust
for Ohju Group...

611
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,570
You've already lost your chance.

612
00:36:44,739 --> 00:36:47,340
The man who was going to be the face
of the company got locked up.

613
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:51,480
Well, let's get rid of Mr. Son.

614
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:55,650
I'm trying to find someone else
that can be the face of the group.

615
00:36:56,489 --> 00:37:00,659
Just cutting the tail off
won't solve the problem.

616
00:37:01,289 --> 00:37:03,230
You must cut off
everything from waist down.

617
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,760
Pardon me?

618
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:09,329
As for Ohju Group,
forget the blind trust.

619
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,269
You should just donate it
to my father's foundation.

620
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,869
What do you mean...

621
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:21,179
That's the only way you can
sever all ties with Mr. Son.

622
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,280
It'd also be easy to frame it as
corruption he committed personally.

623
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,190
What is it?
Don't you trust my judgment?

624
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,860
No, it's not that. Hang on though.

625
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:45,199
Hold on. Just a moment.

626
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,840
Well...

627
00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:03,849
All right, I think...

628
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:07,460
I understand...

629
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,889
what you're saying,

630
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:13,230
and your words are like
the law to me in and of themselves.

631
00:38:15,869 --> 00:38:17,170
Okay, I'll do that.

632
00:38:27,909 --> 00:38:30,579
Has Wu Hyung Man told you
where he hid the documents?

633
00:38:30,579 --> 00:38:31,579
I'm sorry, sir.

634
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,880
He's keeping his mouth shut.

635
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:35,079
Let me talk to him.

636
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:36,590
Yes, sir.

637
00:38:38,019 --> 00:38:39,019
Hey.

638
00:38:39,789 --> 00:38:41,389
Gosh, seriously.

639
00:38:43,829 --> 00:38:44,889
Hey, pull his head up.

640
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,900
He's listening, sir.
Please go ahead.

641
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,400
I guess you keep
putting up a fight...

642
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,900
because you have
nothing to lose now.

643
00:38:56,070 --> 00:39:00,039
If you continue to keep
your mouth shut until I get there,

644
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,650
Bong Sang Pil and Ha Jae I...

645
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:06,349
I'll take care of them both.

646
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:10,190
What do you say?
I can get rid of them quietly...

647
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,389
An Oh Ju.

648
00:39:12,219 --> 00:39:14,519
You disgusting scumbag!

649
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,530
You piece of... Sorry, sir.
I'll call you back later.

650
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:19,030
Gosh!

651
00:39:19,699 --> 00:39:21,530
What are you waiting for? Whack him!

652
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:22,530
Yes, sir.

653
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:32,369
Goodness, are you here
because of the bank president?

654
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:33,679
Let's stop worrying about...

655
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:37,710
How dare you fool my daughter
and try to get her fired?

656
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,489
Enough.

657
00:39:43,219 --> 00:39:45,190
Let's call it even.

658
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,219
What did you just say?

659
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,730
Let go. I said, let go!

660
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,300
Listen carefully, okay?

661
00:39:59,969 --> 00:40:02,400
I'm the mayor now.

662
00:40:04,309 --> 00:40:06,110
Today is...

663
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:10,150
the last day you can get away
with this. The very last day.

664
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:14,349
Goodness. You call yourself
a mayor when you're just a puppet?

665
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:18,050
You shouldn't be
treating me like this.

666
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,289
Do you have a brain or what?

667
00:40:21,489 --> 00:40:22,559
What are you talking about?

668
00:40:23,059 --> 00:40:25,800
Try to rack your brain a little.

669
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,800
Let go of me!

670
00:40:28,329 --> 00:40:30,000
Know your place, will you?

671
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:33,900
Go see how Judge Cha is doing.

672
00:40:34,269 --> 00:40:35,809
She must be very stressed out...

673
00:40:36,139 --> 00:40:37,510
because of what happened to
the bank president.

674
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,869
Let go of me.

675
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:40,039
Gosh, calm down.

676
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,510
If we don't do a good job
to support Judge Cha,

677
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:46,519
she can get in big trouble.

678
00:40:49,789 --> 00:40:50,849
So you should...

679
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:54,420
go and see her right now.

680
00:40:56,059 --> 00:40:57,159
An Oh Ju.

681
00:40:58,059 --> 00:40:59,329
You listen carefully now.

682
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:01,730
If Judge Cha is like
the mother of Kiseong,

683
00:41:02,429 --> 00:41:04,630
Yeon Hee is like
the daughter of Kiseong.

684
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,570
You got that?

685
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:11,210
Try and do whatever you want.

686
00:41:11,539 --> 00:41:12,840
I won't let you get your way.

687
00:41:15,909 --> 00:41:17,610
Hey, your purse.

688
00:41:25,289 --> 00:41:26,420
Goodbye.

689
00:41:32,489 --> 00:41:33,500
Judge Cha.

690
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,900
Judge Cha, what happened?

691
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:38,769
What should I start with?

692
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,269
Don't make such a fuss.

693
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:46,539
Find out which judge
put Ha Jae I on suspension.

694
00:41:46,539 --> 00:41:47,539
Sorry?

695
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,579
Why do you want to find out
who did it?

696
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,880
I'll look into it right away, ma'am.

697
00:42:00,289 --> 00:42:01,389
It's me.

698
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:04,360
Judge Cha asked Nam Soon Ja...

699
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:08,699
to find out which judge
put Ha Jae I on suspension.

700
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:15,840
All right.

701
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,780
And just remember
that the most important person...

702
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,550
is Nam Soon Ja.

703
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:25,780
Okay?

but I don't think
I can do that anymore.

I'll put you behind bars
for assaulting a judge.

714
00:43:28,139 --> 00:43:31,480
My gosh, Attorney Ha.
It's been a long time.

715
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:34,679
I've been wondering where you'd be,
and you're back in your hometown.

716
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:38,349
I've been transferred
to the Kiseong District Court.

717
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:39,760
Let go of my hand, please.

718
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,420
Yes, sorry.

719
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:45,329
Gosh, I overreacted back then...

720
00:43:45,329 --> 00:43:46,760
because I didn't know you well.

721
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,199
You didn't deserve to be suspended
for six months, don't you think?

722
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:54,340
You appealed to the administrative
court against the decision.

723
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,369
The process must've been
very stressful for you.

724
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:02,639
Judge Hong and I contacted
the Bar Association.

725
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:04,380
Your disciplinary period
will end soon.

726
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:07,179
You got your job back.

727

As attorney Ha Jae I.

728
00:44:14,489 --> 00:44:17,429
I thought you'd be pleased.
What's that look for?

729
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:19,429
I didn't do the right thing,

730
00:44:19,929 --> 00:44:21,860
but I thought it was
a wrong disciplinary punishment.

731
00:44:23,699 --> 00:44:27,039
Thank you for
rectifying things for me.

732
00:44:29,639 --> 00:44:31,909
But you'll regret
doing so very soon.

733
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:35,809
Once my suspension is over,

734
00:44:36,849 --> 00:44:39,449
I'll investigate and
expose your crimes,

735
00:44:39,949 --> 00:44:41,650
and take you to court.

736
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:05,210
Judge Cha lifted my suspension
from practicing law.

737
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:06,639
Really?

738
00:45:07,909 --> 00:45:08,980
Are you pleased?

Does that mean we're partners now?

740

We'll be attorney partners.

Yes. Seok Gwan Dong who was
always at An Oh Ju's side...

747
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:37,639
disappeared a few days ago.

748
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:39,980
He must be with Wu Hyung Man.

749
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:44,750
Geum Kang and Kwang Soo
are looking. We'll find them soon.

I think they have Wu Hyung Man.

You think An Oh Ju will go to
where they have him?

765
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:45,409
Wu Hyung Man is in danger.

live in silence.

817
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:00,559
Don't cause trouble.

818
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,630
You're here.

819
00:51:42,369 --> 00:51:43,469
Are you crying?

820
00:51:44,409 --> 00:51:45,610
I...

821
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,380
want to do good thing.

822
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,550
It definitely is
the right thing to do,

823
00:51:55,849 --> 00:51:58,389
but someone told me not to do it.

824
00:51:58,389 --> 00:52:01,460
You shouldn't wonder
whether or not to do the good thing.

825
00:52:02,059 --> 00:52:04,190
It's right to do the good thing.

826
00:52:05,659 --> 00:52:06,699
Yes.

827
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:09,429
You're right.

828
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:12,070
- Right?
- Yes, you're right.

829
00:52:17,539 --> 00:52:18,769
At least...

830
00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:23,110
the world you live in
should be different.

831
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:36,019
- Welcome, sir.
- Hi.

832
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:37,760
- Where are they?
- Inside.

833
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:39,630
- Over there?
- Yes.

834
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:48,840
What do you have?

835
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,309
I think we found Wu Hyung Man.

836
00:52:50,309 --> 00:52:51,909
Wait. I'll be there soon.

837
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:02,480
Did he confess?

838
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:05,849
Yes. He was using the trunk
of a stolen car as a safe.

839
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:08,989
I'll set it up, so you can
check for yourself.

840
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,960
- Wake him up.
- Yes, sir.

841
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:17,199
Wake up.

842
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:22,869
Hyung Man.

843
00:53:24,039 --> 00:53:25,039
Hey.

844
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:26,840
I'm here.

845
00:53:27,409 --> 00:53:30,150
That thing on Kiseong Savings Bank.

846
00:53:31,909 --> 00:53:33,980
Did you hand everything over to...

847
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,780
that kid Bong Sang Pil?

848
00:53:36,449 --> 00:53:37,989
That was you, wasn't it?

849
00:53:40,489 --> 00:53:41,489
Yes.

850
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,559
Well done,

851
00:53:43,889 --> 00:53:45,230
Bong Sang Pil.

852
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:48,199
He did great.

853
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:51,269
How dare you talk like that
to the mayor?

854
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:52,599
My goodness.

855
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:55,940
Hyung Man.

856
00:53:57,869 --> 00:54:00,010
Though I've changed my mind,

857
00:54:00,179 --> 00:54:03,349
you can't change your mind.

858
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:06,550
People shouldn't do that.

859
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:09,989
You're doomed, you jerk.

860
00:54:10,090 --> 00:54:13,150
Well done, Bong Sang Pil.

861
00:54:15,389 --> 00:54:17,260
Well done.

862
00:54:18,929 --> 00:54:21,099
He's out of his mind.

863
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:24,070
He's a former detective.

864
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:27,440
Are you sure you can
leave him like that?

865
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:30,809
I have my own rules.

866
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:32,710
I can forgive an enemy,

867
00:54:33,409 --> 00:54:35,880
but I can't forgive a betrayer.

868
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:38,380
I'll remember that.

869
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,250
You know what?

870
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:45,920
You and I will go find his safe.

871
00:54:48,289 --> 00:54:49,719
And the betrayer.

872
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:55,900
Tell my people...

873
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,230
to take care of him.

874
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:01,340
Yes, sir.

875
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:09,639
- You're here.
- Where's An Oh Ju?

876
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:11,610
He was in the warehouse
with Seok Gwan Dong,

877
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:12,750
but he's going somewhere else now.

878
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:14,079
Geum Kang is chasing them.

879
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:15,650
Let's go.

880
00:55:21,489 --> 00:55:22,559
Who are you?

881
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:38,309
Hyung Man!

882
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,260
It's all set, sir.

883
00:55:55,690 --> 00:55:57,159
Call me Mayor.

884
00:56:02,929 --> 00:56:03,929
Burn it.

885
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:05,369
Yes, Mayor.

886
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,039
It's on fire.

887
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:50,010
My gosh.

888
00:56:53,579 --> 00:56:54,579
What's going on?

889
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:24,250
You jerk!

890
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,320
Get off!

891
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,510
You idiot!

892
00:58:01,849 --> 00:58:02,920
Wu Hyung Man!

893
00:58:08,619 --> 00:58:10,260
We should take him
to the hospital. Get up.

894
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:20,570
Darn it.

895
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,909
- We don't have time. Bring the car.
- Okay.

896
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:32,150
I should've died in your hands.

897
00:58:34,349 --> 00:58:35,550
Stop talking, Wu Hyung Man.

898
00:58:36,849 --> 00:58:37,889
Stop talking.

899
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:43,960
I think this is it.

900
00:58:45,789 --> 00:58:47,059
I'm sorry,

901
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:52,030
but I wanted to tell you this.

902
00:58:52,699 --> 00:58:54,099
Stop talking.

903
00:58:57,110 --> 00:58:58,969
I was glad...

904
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:04,280
that you were my attorney,
Bong Sang Pil.

905
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:09,420
And...

906
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:11,690
don't...

907
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:14,460
forgive me...

908
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:19,860
forever.

909
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,440
Wu Hyung Man.

910
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:32,269
Wake up, Hyung Man!

911
00:59:33,809 --> 00:59:35,179
Wake up!

912
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:37,449
Wu Hyung Man.

913
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:21,119
How was the redevelopment
in the past?

914
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:24,489
Contractors just bulldozed
their way...

915
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:26,889
to jerry-building...

916
01:00:27,329 --> 01:00:29,159
with some lame
construction materials.

917
01:00:29,159 --> 01:00:31,769
And the union members...

918
01:00:31,769 --> 01:00:33,530
committed an irregularity...

919
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:36,440
obsessed with...

920
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:38,769
siphoning money.

921
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:41,110
Just because you're tenants,

922
01:00:41,579 --> 01:00:44,210
you were kicked out
from your house...

923
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:46,449
without any money...

924
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:49,150
to find a new place.

925
01:00:49,619 --> 01:00:50,650
But this...

926
01:00:51,289 --> 01:00:53,550
redevelopment project
of Sinjeong district...

927
01:00:54,159 --> 01:00:57,429
called Golden City...

928
01:00:57,429 --> 01:00:59,059
will be the revolutionary project...

929
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,900
served by the city government
of Kiseong,

930
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:06,730
which will remain in history.

931
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:23,550
My gosh.

932
01:01:24,519 --> 01:01:25,519
Hey.

933
01:01:27,019 --> 01:01:28,119
I knew it.

934
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:31,860
You're a man, Bong Sang Pil.

935
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:36,860
I didn't know you'd be here.

936
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:37,929
You're so generous.

937
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:41,099
And this is no place for you.

938
01:01:42,869 --> 01:01:44,010
Who are you?

939
01:01:46,769 --> 01:01:49,110
I think we met before.

940
01:01:49,179 --> 01:01:53,449
You always tag along
with Bong Sang Pil.

941
01:01:53,449 --> 01:01:55,320
I think I saw her.

942
01:01:58,219 --> 01:01:59,849
Look at you.

943
01:02:00,889 --> 01:02:02,190
That's cool.

944
01:02:04,329 --> 01:02:05,489
I'm an attorney.

945
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:07,630
You don't need
to know my name though.

946
01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:16,070
My gosh.

947
01:02:18,139 --> 01:02:19,239
Hyung Man.

948
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:22,780
My friend.

949
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:27,650
I'm here. Rest in peace.

950
01:02:29,019 --> 01:02:30,150
Goodbye.

951
01:02:31,949 --> 01:02:34,320
You've come to his funeral
after killing him.

952
01:02:34,889 --> 01:02:36,320
You're unbelievable.

953
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:39,989
Did you see that?

954
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:43,400
Did you see that?

955
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,769
You lawyers...

956
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:51,909
can't accuse me of such crime...

957
01:02:52,969 --> 01:02:55,280
without a shred of evidence.

958
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:59,579
Boys, let's go.

959
01:02:59,579 --> 01:03:00,750
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

960
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:04,920
Hold on a second.

961
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:11,389
You, Bong Sang Pil.

962
01:03:13,559 --> 01:03:15,659
Hyung Man doesn't have any family,

963
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:19,469
but it's not right
for you to oversee his funeral.

964
01:03:22,269 --> 01:03:24,210
Your dead mother...

965
01:03:26,309 --> 01:03:29,139
would be extremely upset...

966
01:03:29,579 --> 01:03:30,710
from up above.

967
01:03:33,809 --> 01:03:34,949
An Oh Ju,

968
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:38,889
I'll take you to court
no matter what.

969
01:04:10,789 --> 01:04:11,889
Excuse me.

970
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:14,690
Gosh...

971
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:19,159
I'm sorry.

972
01:04:22,329 --> 01:04:23,659
Are you all right?

973
01:04:52,789 --> 01:04:54,500
(Lawless Lawyer)

974
01:04:54,730 --> 01:04:57,730
We might get buried ourselves
if we go after them individually.

975
01:04:57,730 --> 01:05:00,170
We need a big net
to catch them all at once.

976
01:05:00,369 --> 01:05:03,599
An Oh Ju cut off the tail for good.

977
01:05:03,769 --> 01:05:05,769
It's my money,
I can do whatever I want.

978
01:05:05,769 --> 01:05:07,909
Try and stop me if you can.

979
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:09,679
We were threatened.

980
01:05:09,679 --> 01:05:11,880
Please, I need you to protect Jae I.

981
01:05:12,179 --> 01:05:14,619
What will you do now?

982
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:16,719
Sang Pil! No, let go of me!

983
01:05:16,719 --> 01:05:17,949
Don't worry...

984
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:20,760
I will protect you.

985
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:23,090
No... No!
