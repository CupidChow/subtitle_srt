1
00:01:35,618 --> 00:01:38,842
(My Boss)

2
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,199
(Episode 32)

3
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,762
(I, Qian Heng, trust Cheng Yao unconditionally.)

4
00:01:49,494 --> 00:01:50,922
I'm sorry about Wu Jie's case.

5
00:01:51,431 --> 00:01:52,802
It was all my fault.

6
00:01:54,871 --> 00:01:56,081
I'll resign as soon as possible.

7
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,082
Resign?

8
00:02:00,736 --> 00:02:02,442
I know you were wronged just now.

9
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,469
Take a break first. Don't rush.

10
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:06,391
You should know Junheng & Co is a team.

11
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:07,631
Even if something big happens,

12
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,602
Qian Heng and I will stand with you to solve the problem.

13
00:02:10,934 --> 00:02:14,205
Besides, I already understand the ins and outs of this matter.

14
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:17,675
The loss of evidence was just an accident. It wasn't a mistake.

15
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,541
And your abilities did not let this incident

16
00:02:19,622 --> 00:02:20,922
affect the final judgment.

17
00:02:21,229 --> 00:02:23,060
Even if it was a lawyer's mistake,

18
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,910
we won't use your resignation as a solution.

19
00:02:27,191 --> 00:02:28,401
Thank you for understanding me.

20
00:02:30,431 --> 00:02:32,002
Actually, being able to know you

21
00:02:32,544 --> 00:02:34,935
and receiving your help and guidance

22
00:02:35,232 --> 00:02:37,422
has been one of the biggest gains for me at Junheng & Co.

23
00:02:38,631 --> 00:02:40,314
It's not because of Wu Jie that I want to resign.

24
00:02:40,457 --> 00:02:41,807
Then, it's because of Lawyer Liang.

25
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,616
There's no need for it, Cheng Yao. She just joined the law firm.

26
00:02:45,697 --> 00:02:48,221
We are still in a stage of mutual adaptation.

27
00:02:48,307 --> 00:02:50,480
I know she didn't handle this matter very well.

28
00:02:50,561 --> 00:02:52,602
I'll talk to her later. I'll chat with her.

29
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:57,682
Actually, when I first became a lawyer,

30
00:02:57,933 --> 00:03:00,183
my dream was to one day

31
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:01,962
be able to work at Junheng & Co.

32
00:03:03,578 --> 00:03:06,551
So no matter how hard the work was, I never had the thought of giving up.

33
00:03:08,191 --> 00:03:09,757
But now it seems like everything I do

34
00:03:09,838 --> 00:03:12,061
is labeled as Qian Heng's girlfriend,

35
00:03:12,552 --> 00:03:14,002
not as Cheng Yao, the lawyer.

36
00:03:15,151 --> 00:03:16,231
You don't have to persuade me.

37
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,280
I know you may not understand.

38
00:03:18,854 --> 00:03:20,283
But I have to leave.

39
00:03:21,512 --> 00:03:23,221
If I continue to stay here,

40
00:03:24,806 --> 00:03:27,162
even if I do a lot of things, they won't be seen.

41
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,250
I'm sorry, Cheng Yao. This is my fault.

42
00:03:29,736 --> 00:03:31,533
I didn't manage the law firm well and caused you to suffer.

43
00:03:31,614 --> 00:03:32,884
That's not what I meant.

44
00:03:34,809 --> 00:03:35,930
Cheng Yao,

45
00:03:36,112 --> 00:03:37,621
since you joined the law firm,

46
00:03:37,762 --> 00:03:39,402
I have been paying close attention to you.

47
00:03:39,622 --> 00:03:40,853
I have seen your growth.

48
00:03:40,992 --> 00:03:42,882
I also understand your thoughts.

49
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:45,343
I don't want you to leave because of some personal agenda.

50
00:03:45,424 --> 00:03:47,391
It's because my buddy has finally found the right person.

51
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:49,941
I hope you two can be together for a very long time.

52
00:03:51,527 --> 00:03:52,720
Junheng & Co is where you two started.

53
00:03:52,792 --> 00:03:54,272
I don't want you two to end here.

54
00:03:54,371 --> 00:03:56,574
Of course, if it's about a superior-subordinate relationship,

55
00:03:56,667 --> 00:03:58,976
I hope you can spread your wings and fly high, achieve your dreams,

56
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,230
and become the kind of lawyer you want to be.

57
00:04:06,591 --> 00:04:07,752
Thank you, Lawyer Wu.

58
00:04:07,832 --> 00:04:09,742
Before making a decision, calm down first.

59
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,522
Listen to others' opinions and thoughts.

60
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:13,202
I can give you three options.

61
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,040
First, you can apply for a leave of absence.

62
00:04:15,112 --> 00:04:17,282
During your leave, I will take care of everything.

63
00:04:17,363 --> 00:04:20,042
Second, I can transfer you back to Qian Heng's team.

64
00:04:20,112 --> 00:04:23,355
He has a lot of international cases now and travels a lot.

65
00:04:23,436 --> 00:04:24,800
You don't have to come to the law firm every day.

66
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:26,091
Third,

67
00:04:26,172 --> 00:04:27,862
if you really want to resign,

68
00:04:30,472 --> 00:04:32,501
I can also give you a recommendation letter.

69
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:44,961
I will consider it carefully.

70
00:04:45,878 --> 00:04:47,027
Cheng Yao, I am not only your boss,

71
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,350
but also your family.

72
00:04:49,552 --> 00:04:50,762
Keep going.

73
00:04:51,433 --> 00:04:52,643
You can do it.

74
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,642
(Resignation Letter)

75
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:31,934
(Applicant: Cheng Yao)

76
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,442
(Sender: Cheng Yao)

77
00:05:50,112 --> 00:05:52,079
Before making a decision, calm down first.

78
00:05:52,191 --> 00:05:53,742
Listen to others' opinions and thoughts.

79
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:27,299
(Where are you?)

80
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,200
What's wrong?

81
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,683
Why are you still sleeping?

82
00:06:38,152 --> 00:06:39,592
I was looking at the case for too long

83
00:06:39,672 --> 00:06:40,882
and got a little tired.

84
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:44,039
(But when I saw you, I was revived.)

85
00:06:48,552 --> 00:06:49,762
What's wrong?

86
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,400
Do you need your boyfriend, Qian Heng

87
00:06:54,491 --> 00:06:57,222
or your boss, Lawyer Qian?

88
00:06:57,552 --> 00:07:00,061
Both are at your service.

89
00:07:02,912 --> 00:07:05,191
It's nothing. I'm just hungry.

90
00:07:05,271 --> 00:07:07,021
I want you to accompany me when I cook noodles.

91
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,602
(Okay.)

92
00:07:53,871 --> 00:07:55,461
Then, I'll start eating.

93
00:08:15,282 --> 00:08:16,682
(Resignation Letter)

94
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:48,657
Look, which lipstick shade is suitable for Tan Ying?

95
00:08:49,415 --> 00:08:50,815
Number 16 or 60?

96
00:08:50,911 --> 00:08:52,142
Do you see any difference?

97
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,001
Are you blind?

98
00:08:55,209 --> 00:08:56,759
The difference is huge.

99
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:58,881
Then, what is this color?

100
00:09:00,511 --> 00:09:01,721
Bright red.

101
00:09:01,802 --> 00:09:02,850
And this one?

102
00:09:03,031 --> 00:09:04,241
Crimson.

103
00:09:06,431 --> 00:09:07,444
I shouldn't have asked you.

104
00:09:07,525 --> 00:09:10,050
I know what matte red and what brick red is.

105
00:09:11,025 --> 00:09:12,235
Well, I'll buy them all.

106
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:14,221
You reminded me.

107
00:09:14,775 --> 00:09:17,602
If I go abroad and don't bring anything back for my girlfriend,

108
00:09:17,751 --> 00:09:19,642
will I have to kneel on the washboard when I get home?

109
00:09:20,832 --> 00:09:22,431
Boss, are you buying or not?

110
00:09:22,573 --> 00:09:24,003
If you buy, let's buy together.

111
00:09:24,405 --> 00:09:26,728
If you're not buying, we'll both kneel on the washboard.

112
00:09:27,044 --> 00:09:28,687
Cheng Yao is not a materialistic person like that.

113
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:29,978
I won't go.

114
00:09:31,432 --> 00:09:32,642
Then, I won't buy either.

115
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,250
I'll just kneel on the washboard.

116
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,248
My girlfriend is not materialistic either.

117
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:39,159
Tan Ying is not materialistic either.

118
00:09:39,257 --> 00:09:41,112
I just want to buy her something.

119
00:09:41,192 --> 00:09:42,803
You know, it's not easy for me to go abroad.

120
00:09:42,912 --> 00:09:44,759
So I want to bring her something back to make her happy.

121
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,271
I would buy a year's supply.

122
00:09:46,421 --> 00:09:48,011
This is just me being lazy.

123
00:09:50,751 --> 00:09:52,662
If you two don't buy,

124
00:09:53,031 --> 00:09:54,302
I'll just go by myself.

125
00:09:54,965 --> 00:09:56,236
Well. I'll go too.

126
00:09:57,258 --> 00:09:58,597
No. Don't you love kneeling on the washboard?

127
00:09:58,678 --> 00:10:00,729
My knees haven't been feeling well lately. Let's go.

128
00:10:02,751 --> 00:10:03,961
Shallow.

129
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,484
Do you think this is enough for Tan Ying for a year?

130
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,875
Yours is definitely enough for a year. Mine is enough for two years.

131
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:11,202
Right?

132
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:22,961
All of these are more than enough to last a lifetime.

133
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:25,998
Did we buy too little?

134
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,440
Let's go take another look. Let's go.

135
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:28,737
Go back and take another look.

136
00:10:35,294 --> 00:10:37,425
Do you know which country is the most insular?

137
00:10:37,506 --> 00:10:40,442
- Which country?   - Right here, Switzerland.

138
00:10:40,792 --> 00:10:43,042
- Why?   - Because of the "Swiss roll".

139
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,442
I won't entertain you anymore.

140
00:10:58,906 --> 00:11:02,162
(Resignation Letter)

141
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:05,022
Cheng Yao handed in the resignation letter.

142
00:11:07,992 --> 00:11:09,752
I think she must be very sad now.

143
00:11:09,848 --> 00:11:11,882
What about me bringing you to her so you can take a look at her?

144
00:11:14,232 --> 00:11:15,902
Yao Yao didn't tell me.

145
00:11:16,534 --> 00:11:18,903
It means she wants to digest this on her own.

146
00:11:19,743 --> 00:11:23,461
What I can do is to unconditionally support her

147
00:11:23,702 --> 00:11:24,933
after she makes her decision

148
00:11:25,511 --> 00:11:28,762
and provide you with a hiding place.

149
00:11:30,258 --> 00:11:31,880
What do you mean by providing me with a hiding place?

150
00:11:31,961 --> 00:11:32,993
What does that mean?

151
00:11:33,081 --> 00:11:35,002
You are the leader of Junheng & Co,

152
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,682
and you accept Yao Yao's resignation.

153
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,719
When Qian Heng returns from his business trip in a few days,

154
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,880
he will blame you.

155
00:11:39,952 --> 00:11:42,042
We've been brothers for so many years. He won't hurt me, right?

156
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:46,070
Even if he won't hurt you physically,

157
00:11:46,182 --> 00:11:47,612
what about your year-end bonus?

158
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:51,232
- Or your share of the profits?   - Let's not talk about it.

159
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,530
I'm having a headache.

160
00:12:06,911 --> 00:12:09,062
I'll go talk to Qian Heng for you. What do you think?

161
00:12:16,631 --> 00:12:17,802
No.

162
00:12:18,531 --> 00:12:20,802
 I caused this mess myself. I'll handle it.

163
00:12:22,192 --> 00:12:23,861
Besides, dealing with Qian,

164
00:12:25,073 --> 00:12:26,969
I should be able to come up with a solution.

165
00:12:27,062 --> 00:12:28,922
- Can you?   - I'm sure I can.

166
00:12:34,392 --> 00:12:35,442
Sign.

167
00:12:36,844 --> 00:12:38,872
- You didn't knock on the door?   - I did.

168
00:12:38,953 --> 00:12:40,402
You didn't hear me?

169
00:12:45,038 --> 00:12:46,602
Loudness doesn't guarantee superiority.

170
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,082
What's the matter?

171
00:12:51,192 --> 00:12:52,392
Are you standing up for Cheng Yao?

172
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:56,091
I just don't understand why you agreed to let Cheng Yao resign

173
00:12:56,172 --> 00:12:57,791
even after Wu Jie's issue was resolved.

174
00:12:57,909 --> 00:12:59,282
As for Liang Yi Ran,

175
00:12:59,472 --> 00:13:01,305
Cheng Yao treated her like a female knight.

176
00:13:01,393 --> 00:13:03,209
But she didn't stand up for her when it mattered.

177
00:13:05,398 --> 00:13:07,108
We can't blame everything on Liang Yi Ran.

178
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,061
Tan Ying, think about it carefully.

179
00:13:10,235 --> 00:13:13,392
If your boyfriend is Qian Heng instead of Yu Fei,

180
00:13:13,557 --> 00:13:14,906
would you still want to stay here?

181
00:13:21,992 --> 00:13:23,422
All right, think about it carefully.

182
00:13:27,024 --> 00:13:29,522
Send her off. After all, Bao Rui and Yu Fei are both not here.

183
00:14:19,008 --> 00:14:20,927
I know I'm very charismatic.

184
00:14:21,008 --> 00:14:23,202
But work is work. Especially when it comes to superiors and subordinates.

185
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,151
If certain feelings, whether genuine or not, start to impact your work,

186
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:27,392
it becomes highly unprofessional.

187
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,016
Before you, 13 assistants were all fired

188
00:14:29,097 --> 00:14:31,350
because of such unprofessional behavior.

189
00:14:34,119 --> 00:14:36,881
We are not defending narrow individual cases.

190
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:38,500
We are defending procedural justice.

191
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,270
That is the greatest value of being a lawyer.

192
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:46,502
I want to give special praise to Cheng Yao.

193
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:48,999
Since joining the law firm, she has made great progress.

194
00:14:49,142 --> 00:14:50,682
Today, she even won her case for the first time.

195
00:14:50,782 --> 00:14:51,992
Congratulations, Cheng Yao!

196
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,482
(Exit group)

197
00:15:38,722 --> 00:15:40,362
(Glory and Wealth)

198
00:15:43,556 --> 00:15:45,402
(Exit group)

199
00:15:46,784 --> 00:15:48,092
You're just resigning, right?

200
00:15:48,173 --> 00:15:49,228
It's not like we can't have any contact anymore.

201
00:15:49,309 --> 00:15:50,721
There's no need to cut off completely.

202
00:15:51,432 --> 00:15:54,325
The firm's rules state that I have to leave all work-related group chats.

203
00:15:56,151 --> 00:15:57,981
We can just create a new one for personal chats.

204
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,872
It's much harder to find friends to hang out with than to find a law firm.

205
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,710
When Lawyer Wu transferred me to that all-men team before,

206
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:08,542
I didn't expect to meet such like-minded friends.

207
00:16:10,551 --> 00:16:11,872
You can leave the company group chat.

208
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,629
You're not allowed to leave the Glory and Wealth group without permission.

209
00:16:19,389 --> 00:16:20,599
Oh, by the way,

210
00:16:22,212 --> 00:16:25,084
this box of snacks will be passed on to you guys.

211
00:16:25,592 --> 00:16:27,315
If you need more, I'll come back to replenish.

212
00:16:27,671 --> 00:16:29,042
You must come back.

213
00:16:31,832 --> 00:16:33,042
I hope everything goes smoothly.

214
00:16:35,232 --> 00:16:37,701
Don't tell Qian Heng about my resignation yet.

215
00:16:56,072 --> 00:16:59,221
(If you can't find the answer, why don't you take a different route?)

216
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:02,382
(Don't limit your life to one predicament.)

217
00:17:02,712 --> 00:17:05,021
(Don't waste your time dwelling on things.)

218
00:17:07,672 --> 00:17:09,422
(Thank you, Sister. I understand now.)

219
00:17:40,111 --> 00:17:41,271
Boss, you're back.

220
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,561
Good afternoon, boss.

221
00:17:43,092 --> 00:17:44,719
- Good afternoon, boss.   - Good afternoon, boss.

222
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,010
Lawyer Qian is back.

223
00:18:22,341 --> 00:18:23,932
Tell me, what's going on?

224
00:18:25,435 --> 00:18:26,555
Boss, I have a call.

225
00:18:26,636 --> 00:18:27,846
From a client.

226
00:18:28,952 --> 00:18:30,842
Hello, are you looking for Lawyer Cheng Yao?

227
00:18:30,935 --> 00:18:32,564
Lawyer Cheng Yao has resigned.

228
00:18:32,735 --> 00:18:34,225
She didn't want me to tell you.

229
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,392
Maybe she was afraid

230
00:18:36,487 --> 00:18:37,882
it would affect your case.

231
00:18:39,447 --> 00:18:41,437
Do you have any other questions?

232
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:46,832
Got it. You can go now.

233
00:18:46,912 --> 00:18:48,122
Okay, bye.

234
00:19:01,232 --> 00:19:02,442
Bring it here.

235
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,970
What is it?

236
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,683
Are you kidding me? You promised to bring me the lipstick

237
00:19:05,764 --> 00:19:07,202
before your business trip.

238
00:19:08,494 --> 00:19:09,704
Sorry, I forgot.

239
00:19:11,232 --> 00:19:14,142
I heard from Bao Rui that you went on a shopping spree abroad.

240
00:19:14,232 --> 00:19:15,722
You almost cleared out the entire shelf.

241
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,760
I bought those for Cheng Yao.

242
00:19:17,853 --> 00:19:19,682
I didn't know what she liked, so I just bought everything.

243
00:19:22,672 --> 00:19:25,741
Do you know why Cheng Yao resigned this morning?

244
00:19:28,311 --> 00:19:30,182
I know. I agreed to it.

245
00:19:32,152 --> 00:19:34,562
She is currently in the growth stage at Junheng & Co.

246
00:19:34,664 --> 00:19:36,722
It's a waste for her to leave at this time.

247
00:19:37,132 --> 00:19:39,645
In fact, she's still too young.

248
00:19:39,726 --> 00:19:42,042
She won't turn back until she hits a wall.

249
00:19:43,574 --> 00:19:44,855
Cheng Yao has her own ideas,

250
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:46,365
and I respect her choice.

251
00:19:48,511 --> 00:19:50,062
Sorry, I have something else to attend to.

252
00:20:20,162 --> 00:20:21,802
(Resume)

253
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:27,222
(Resume)

254
00:20:32,436 --> 00:20:33,722
(Resume)

255
00:21:21,111 --> 00:21:22,191
Qian Heng.

256
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:23,442
You're back.

257
00:21:25,271 --> 00:21:26,481
Why did you come back?

258
00:21:27,409 --> 00:21:28,938
I wanted to surprise you.

259
00:21:29,712 --> 00:21:31,602
I'm cooking dinner. It'll be ready soon.

260
00:21:33,142 --> 00:21:34,352
What are these?

261
00:21:35,853 --> 00:21:37,363
Gifts I bought for you.

262
00:21:37,912 --> 00:21:39,112
Bao Rui and Yu Fei also bought some.

263
00:21:39,192 --> 00:21:40,362
I can't lose to them.

264
00:21:40,761 --> 00:21:42,339
Others have these, so my girlfriend must have these.

265
00:21:42,456 --> 00:21:44,242
My girlfriend must possess even more of what others lack.

266
00:21:44,719 --> 00:21:46,159
I want to tell you something.

267
00:21:46,294 --> 00:21:47,494
About quitting, right?

268
00:21:47,621 --> 00:21:48,831
I already know.

269
00:21:49,872 --> 00:21:52,667
It's okay. Maybe in the past few days, work has been too busy.

270
00:21:52,764 --> 00:21:54,954
You must be tired. It's good to take a break.

271
00:21:55,542 --> 00:21:57,122
How about I accompany you on a trip for a few days?

272
00:21:58,126 --> 00:21:59,336
I don't want to go.

273
00:21:59,449 --> 00:22:00,880
You mentioned wanting to watch a movie before.

274
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:02,152
I bought a projector.

275
00:22:02,232 --> 00:22:03,442
How about we watch it together?

276
00:22:03,751 --> 00:22:04,792
What are you cooking?

277
00:22:04,872 --> 00:22:06,082
It's overcooked.

278
00:22:12,743 --> 00:22:14,945
The pot is no longer usable. How about I take you out for a meal?

279
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,560
Well, let me cook.

280
00:22:16,712 --> 00:22:17,922
Wait for me in the living room.

281
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:50,429
I took on a case in Lawyer Liang's team before.

282
00:22:51,992 --> 00:22:53,781
I lost the client's IOU.

283
00:22:54,311 --> 00:22:56,442
The client came to the firm and caused a scene.

284
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:58,883
You were on a business trip. I didn't want to bother you.

285
00:22:59,048 --> 00:23:00,258
So I didn't tell you.

286
00:23:03,597 --> 00:23:04,807
No matter what,

287
00:23:06,031 --> 00:23:07,622
that was my responsibility.

288
00:23:08,209 --> 00:23:09,599
So I resigned out of guilt.

289
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,042
It was my only choice.

290
00:23:12,071 --> 00:23:13,281
You lost the IOU?

291
00:23:13,551 --> 00:23:14,941
How is that possible?

292
00:23:15,632 --> 00:23:17,322
How could you make such a low-level mistake?

293
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:20,221
I also don't know why the IOU suddenly disappeared.

294
00:23:21,952 --> 00:23:25,281
It was always kept safe with other documents in the drawer.

295
00:23:25,872 --> 00:23:27,191
But no one believes me.

296
00:23:27,301 --> 00:23:28,511
I believe you.

297
00:23:29,432 --> 00:23:31,402
Because you are the lawyer I trained.

298
00:23:33,511 --> 00:23:34,552
Don't worry.

299
00:23:34,633 --> 00:23:36,120
I will give you an explanation about this matter.

300
00:23:36,238 --> 00:23:38,488
Lawyers at Junheng & Co can't be wrongly accused.

301
00:23:38,909 --> 00:23:39,949
It's okay.

302
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,240
It's in the past.

303
00:23:41,751 --> 00:23:43,882
It was my insistence to transfer to Lawyer Liang's team.

304
00:23:46,705 --> 00:23:48,496
So I have to take responsibility for my decision.

305
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:54,310
Let's eat. It's getting cold.

306
00:24:14,551 --> 00:24:16,941
I also don't know why the IOU suddenly disappeared.

307
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:21,021
It was always kept safe along with other documents in the drawer.

308
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:23,261
But no one believes it.

309
00:24:40,289 --> 00:24:41,362
Wu Jun.

310
00:24:41,721 --> 00:24:43,642
What exactly transpired with Cheng Yao's resignation?

311
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:57,406
(Sorry, the number you've dialed is currently unavailable.)

312
00:24:57,487 --> 00:24:58,882
(Please try again later.)

313
00:25:11,232 --> 00:25:12,442
Tan Ying,

314
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,800
tell Wu Jun this.

315
00:25:14,232 --> 00:25:16,471
If he wants to save Junheng & Co from being dissolved,

316
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:17,976
find me at the boxing center.

317
00:26:00,145 --> 00:26:01,202
Qian,

318
00:26:01,968 --> 00:26:03,197
have you had enough?

319
00:26:04,158 --> 00:26:05,199
Let me buy you a cup of coffee.

320
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,152
You're in luck. There's a new coffee shop

321
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,392
right next to where I just came from.

322
00:26:09,472 --> 00:26:11,352
Let's go. I'll treat you to a cup of coffee.

323
00:26:11,432 --> 00:26:15,112
This place isn't suitable for chatting, right?

324
00:26:15,285 --> 00:26:16,515
It's not suitable here, right?

325
00:26:17,031 --> 00:26:18,471
Okay, then let's go to the archery range.

326
00:26:18,574 --> 00:26:19,784
Remember to bring an apple.

327
00:26:20,232 --> 00:26:21,442
An apple.

328
00:26:23,232 --> 00:26:25,062
No. Let's stay here.

329
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,349
Qian, let me tell you.

330
00:26:30,071 --> 00:26:34,021
Violence is how primitive people solve problems.

331
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:37,082
Contemporary gentlemen rely on negotiations.

332
00:26:40,591 --> 00:26:41,801
Are you serious?

333
00:27:01,084 --> 00:27:02,294
Raise your hand.

334
00:27:03,619 --> 00:27:05,461
- Lower it.   - Okay.

335
00:27:09,152 --> 00:27:10,801
Be gentle, please.

336
00:27:10,952 --> 00:27:12,162
Gentle.

337
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:18,379
You're not really going to hurt me, right?

338
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:20,481
Let me ask you.

339
00:27:21,325 --> 00:27:22,755
Is Cheng Yao being framed?

340
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:25,312
I'm still investigating this matter.

341
00:27:25,445 --> 00:27:28,469
Even if she was really set up by Liang Yi Ran, don't I need evidence?

342
00:27:28,578 --> 00:27:30,407
What evidence? What does it have to do with Liang Yi Ran?

343
00:27:30,536 --> 00:27:32,046
Doesn't she like you?

344
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,450
She likes me?

345
00:27:33,751 --> 00:27:34,961
How come I didn't know?

346
00:27:35,443 --> 00:27:36,653
Really?

347
00:27:36,854 --> 00:27:38,575
She had a crush on you since our college days.

348
00:27:38,687 --> 00:27:40,797
She liked you for so many years even a blind person could see it.

349
00:27:40,883 --> 00:27:42,093
But you didn't know?

350
00:27:43,654 --> 00:27:45,415
If you knew about it, why did you still hire her?

351
00:27:45,496 --> 00:27:47,722
I didn't know you liked Cheng Yao.

352
00:27:48,851 --> 00:27:51,508
I always thought the friend you mentioned was Liang Yi Ran.

353
00:27:51,589 --> 00:27:53,459
That's why I matched you two.

354
00:27:54,071 --> 00:27:55,879
When I found out that you liked Cheng Yao,

355
00:27:55,985 --> 00:27:59,821
this matter was already a done deal, right?

356
00:28:02,992 --> 00:28:05,202
I acknowledge my responsibility in this matter.

357
00:28:06,071 --> 00:28:07,281
Let's just talk about the facts.

358
00:28:08,031 --> 00:28:09,192
We both have our faults, right?

359
00:28:09,318 --> 00:28:10,668
You can't just blame me.

360
00:28:11,164 --> 00:28:13,002
So Cheng Yao was set up by her, right?

361
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,143
I don't know. After she joined the law firm,

362
00:28:15,224 --> 00:28:16,640
this matter has developed into what it is today.

363
00:28:16,743 --> 00:28:17,882
Why didn't you stop her?

364
00:28:17,943 --> 00:28:19,602
How can I stop her?

365
00:28:20,489 --> 00:28:21,510
I lack evidence.

366
00:28:21,591 --> 00:28:23,367
How could I simply expose and criticize her?

367
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:24,912
What will people say?

368
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,671
Junheng's boss is using personal feelings

369
00:28:27,805 --> 00:28:29,355
to bully a female partner from outside.

370
00:28:30,076 --> 00:28:32,354
Qian, no one dares to say anything to you.

371
00:28:32,435 --> 00:28:34,033
But consider this, what would people say about Cheng Yao?

372
00:28:34,114 --> 00:28:35,956
How will she survive in this industry in the future?

373
00:28:40,068 --> 00:28:41,271
Yes, Cheng Yao has resigned.

374
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:44,331
But with her current abilities, she can still find a good job

375
00:28:44,412 --> 00:28:45,711
and have a good career development.

376
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:46,872
Don't worry.

377
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,039
On the contrary, I believe that at Junheng,

378
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,322
it may not be conducive to her future career development

379
00:28:51,433 --> 00:28:52,990
and her relationship with you.

380
00:28:53,102 --> 00:28:54,832
I will not let Cheng Yao leave.

381
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,842
I will get back the grievances she suffered.

382
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,600
Put it on.

383
00:29:10,591 --> 00:29:14,409
Qian, I know it may be hard for you to accept it right away.

384
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,435
But Qian, don't worry, whatever happens,

385
00:29:16,527 --> 00:29:18,418
I'll be by your side.

386
00:29:18,678 --> 00:29:20,027
Don't worry.

387
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:23,282
In the future, please inform me in advance when hiring female lawyers.

388
00:29:30,192 --> 00:29:31,231
You haven't left work yet?

389
00:29:31,341 --> 00:29:32,802
That's perfect. Let's go together.

390
00:29:33,015 --> 00:29:34,722
- I have something to discuss with you.   - What is it?

391
00:29:35,887 --> 00:29:37,516
When you first joined,

392
00:29:37,765 --> 00:29:40,715
the process was rushed and some steps were missed.

393
00:29:41,031 --> 00:29:42,241
Shall we make up for it?

394
00:29:43,446 --> 00:29:45,476
Your meticulous style has never changed.

395
00:29:45,638 --> 00:29:46,988
What do I need to do?

396
00:29:48,624 --> 00:29:50,534
Can you recite the lawyer's oath?

397
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,803
Our relationship is already so close.

398
00:29:55,154 --> 00:29:56,720
There's no need for this process, right?

399
00:29:56,831 --> 00:29:58,152
It's still necessary.

400
00:29:58,255 --> 00:29:59,804
Otherwise, some people might forget

401
00:30:00,111 --> 00:30:01,422
why they became lawyers.

402
00:30:02,831 --> 00:30:04,461
I don't understand what you're saying.

403
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:08,242
Do you have any comments regarding the case

404
00:30:08,456 --> 00:30:09,642
where Cheng Yao lost the document?

405
00:30:14,022 --> 00:30:16,333
It was indeed my fault for not guiding her properly.

406
00:30:16,472 --> 00:30:18,832
I didn't pay attention to her change in mentality at the time.

407
00:30:18,958 --> 00:30:20,991
I should have reminded her to be more serious.

408
00:30:21,141 --> 00:30:23,882
So I have already refunded the lawyer's fees out of my own pocket.

409
00:30:24,549 --> 00:30:26,202
Did you take the original document?

410
00:30:28,031 --> 00:30:29,781
How could I do such a thing?

411
00:30:29,966 --> 00:30:31,990
That case was handled independently by Cheng Yao.

412
00:30:32,076 --> 00:30:33,409
I have never interfered.

413
00:30:33,522 --> 00:30:35,228
I have never even seen the original document,

414
00:30:35,309 --> 00:30:36,620
let alone touched it.

415
00:30:40,992 --> 00:30:42,112
Look at this.

416
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,322
What is this?

417
00:30:50,217 --> 00:30:52,551
You were afraid of being caught by the cameras in the office area.

418
00:30:52,655 --> 00:30:54,125
So you turned off the firm's power switch.

419
00:30:54,614 --> 00:30:56,044
But all of your little actions

420
00:30:56,447 --> 00:30:58,962
were caught by the cameras in the hallway.

421
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,350
There are so many women wearing white clothes in the firm.

422
00:31:06,872 --> 00:31:08,751
How can you be sure that this person is me?

423
00:31:08,831 --> 00:31:10,422
I'll ask you one last time.

424
00:31:10,542 --> 00:31:11,752
Did you take it?

425
00:31:12,147 --> 00:31:13,951
It wasn't me, Qian Heng.

426
00:31:14,131 --> 00:31:16,552
I know you must feel uncomfortable with Cheng Yao's resignation.

427
00:31:16,656 --> 00:31:19,190
But you can't take out that anger on me.

428
00:31:19,638 --> 00:31:21,097
Cheng Yao couldn't handle her cases well

429
00:31:21,178 --> 00:31:22,191
and couldn't stay at Junheng anymore.

430
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,632
This has nothing to do with me. It's her own problem.

431
00:31:24,774 --> 00:31:26,144
You are also a senior lawyer.

432
00:31:26,271 --> 00:31:28,002
Everything needs evidence.

433
00:31:28,121 --> 00:31:29,920
If you need me to cooperate and verify anything,

434
00:31:30,047 --> 00:31:31,768
I will cooperate in order to prove my innocence.

435
00:31:31,872 --> 00:31:33,522
- Are you sure you didn't touch it?   - Yes.

436
00:31:33,603 --> 00:31:35,482
- And you are willing to prove your innocence?   - Yes.

437
00:31:35,563 --> 00:31:38,293
Okay. Let's go do a fingerprint test.

438
00:31:38,426 --> 00:31:39,552
If you really didn't touch it,

439
00:31:39,632 --> 00:31:41,322
there won't be your fingerprints on the materials, right?

440
00:31:41,822 --> 00:31:42,903
Let's go now.

441
00:31:43,051 --> 00:31:44,882
Are you willing to go to such lengths for her?

442
00:31:45,012 --> 00:31:47,102
You're treating me like a criminal now.

443
00:31:47,183 --> 00:31:48,362
Is it because Cheng Yao told you something?

444
00:31:48,443 --> 00:31:50,042
Do you have the nerve to mention her to me?

445
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:52,522
She has never said a bad word about you.

446
00:31:53,271 --> 00:31:56,751
And she would never do something so foolish or make such a mistake.

447
00:31:56,863 --> 00:31:58,152
I unconditionally believe in her.

448
00:31:58,255 --> 00:31:59,655
Let's go. Come with me.

449
00:31:59,824 --> 00:32:01,239
Come on, let's go.

450
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,482
Qian Heng.

451
00:32:03,367 --> 00:32:05,249
Yes, it was me.

452
00:32:05,638 --> 00:32:06,838
I just don't like her.

453
00:32:06,921 --> 00:32:08,391
She seduced you, and you fell for it.

454
00:32:08,472 --> 00:32:10,282
- You always defend her.   - Shut up.

455
00:32:14,472 --> 00:32:15,682
Qian Heng.

456
00:32:17,129 --> 00:32:18,839
Is your heart dead?

457
00:32:19,953 --> 00:32:21,120
Do you realize...

458
00:32:21,201 --> 00:32:22,510
I don't want to know.

459
00:32:22,954 --> 00:32:24,164
Liang Yi Ran.

460
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,722
I used to admire your work abilities.

461
00:32:27,094 --> 00:32:29,202
But now, you have no professional ethics.

462
00:32:29,472 --> 00:32:32,392
I hope you can clarify your actions and apologize to Cheng Yao in person.

463
00:32:32,531 --> 00:32:35,722
If you don't cooperate, I will call the police and clear her name.

464
00:32:37,351 --> 00:32:38,991
All of our conversations have been recorded.

465
00:32:39,072 --> 00:32:40,282
Listen for yourself.

466
00:32:44,152 --> 00:32:45,362
Qian Heng.

467
00:32:47,111 --> 00:32:48,961
Do you know that if you call the police,

468
00:32:49,311 --> 00:32:50,552
my career will be ruined?

469
00:32:50,689 --> 00:32:52,362
Then, you should know

470
00:32:52,899 --> 00:32:54,708
that from the moment you framed Cheng Yao,

471
00:32:54,789 --> 00:32:56,280
this would be the outcome.

472
00:33:15,696 --> 00:33:16,906
I just want to know

473
00:33:17,351 --> 00:33:18,561
what makes her so special.

474
00:33:20,232 --> 00:33:21,442
You don't need to know.

475
00:33:22,232 --> 00:33:24,602
That's enough for me alone to know.

476
00:33:29,311 --> 00:33:30,521
Qian.

477
00:33:37,791 --> 00:33:40,122
The three of us have known each other since college, right?

478
00:33:40,751 --> 00:33:41,961
Since that's the case,

479
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:43,709
we can also call ourselves a family.

480
00:33:43,831 --> 00:33:45,041
Right?

481
00:33:46,023 --> 00:33:49,354
Can we keep family matters behind closed doors and handle them ourselves?

482
00:33:50,751 --> 00:33:52,792
If you call the police right now and have her arrested,

483
00:33:52,872 --> 00:33:55,122
our little junior sister will be ruined for life.

484
00:33:55,358 --> 00:33:57,069
Junheng will also be implicated.

485
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:59,162
Are you willing?

486
00:34:01,567 --> 00:34:02,642
Trust me.

487
00:34:02,872 --> 00:34:04,082
Leave this matter to me.

488
00:34:05,929 --> 00:34:07,139
I promise you.

489
00:34:08,095 --> 00:34:09,962
Cheng Yao will not suffer any more injustice.

490
00:34:10,272 --> 00:34:11,722
I will restore her reputation.

491
00:34:11,942 --> 00:34:13,762
If I don't handle this matter well,

492
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,762
I will offer myself as a target at the archery center.

493
00:34:18,054 --> 00:34:19,264
Is that okay?

494
00:34:31,312 --> 00:34:32,642
Don't let me see her again.

495
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:48,921
That's basically it.

496
00:34:49,711 --> 00:34:51,462
So you're not angry anymore, right?

497
00:34:52,312 --> 00:34:53,942
You watched the surveillance all night.

498
00:34:57,511 --> 00:34:59,142
Why are you looking at me like that?

499
00:35:00,111 --> 00:35:01,662
I feel like you've changed a lot.

500
00:35:02,379 --> 00:35:04,419
I still remember when we first met,

501
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,042
you used to always mention your hourly rate of 10,000 yuan.

502
00:35:07,888 --> 00:35:10,478
Now you're willing to spend so much time on this.

503
00:35:11,975 --> 00:35:13,724
You were treated unjustly in this manner.

504
00:35:13,832 --> 00:35:15,301
I still feel like I'm not efficient enough.

505
00:35:16,746 --> 00:35:18,282
Okay, don't overthink it.

506
00:35:18,392 --> 00:35:19,602
Let it go.

507
00:35:19,952 --> 00:35:22,962
I'll call Wu Jun later and transfer you back to my team.

508
00:35:23,231 --> 00:35:24,781
But I've already resigned.

509
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:25,910
So what?

510
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,482
The truth has been revealed.

511
00:35:27,912 --> 00:35:29,392
No one will talk behind your back anymore.

512
00:35:29,518 --> 00:35:30,637
And I promise you,

513
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,051
you won't see Liang Yi Ran in the law firm again.

514
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:34,641
Come back.

515
00:35:34,752 --> 00:35:35,962
I can't.

516
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,882
I've thought about it seriously.

517
00:35:38,031 --> 00:35:40,582
It's a good time to think about my future plans.

518
00:35:40,943 --> 00:35:42,471
What's there to think about?

519
00:35:42,567 --> 00:35:44,362
Isn't Junheng & Co the best choice for you?

520
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:46,796
How do you know I don't have a better choice?

521
00:35:46,992 --> 00:35:48,202
Then tell me,

522
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,260
where else can you go if you leave Junheng & Co?

523
00:35:52,631 --> 00:35:53,901
What do you mean?

524
00:35:54,032 --> 00:35:56,182
Do you think that no one will want me if I leave Junheng & Co?

525
00:35:56,472 --> 00:35:57,682
No.

526
00:35:57,912 --> 00:35:59,381
How is that possible?

527
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:05,042
Cheng Yao.

528
00:36:05,725 --> 00:36:09,126
Yes. I know no matter how hard I try, I can't catch up to you.

529
00:36:09,272 --> 00:36:10,822
But I am also an adult.

530
00:36:11,022 --> 00:36:12,572
I have the right to make decisions for myself.

531
00:36:17,952 --> 00:36:19,082
Yao Yao.

532
00:36:23,061 --> 00:36:24,652
Yao Yao, I just want to help you.

533
00:36:26,952 --> 00:36:29,182
Stop it. I need to calm down.

534
00:36:30,792 --> 00:36:32,261
Then, I won't bother you tonight.

535
00:36:33,392 --> 00:36:34,602
I'll go back to the villa to sleep.

536
00:36:36,272 --> 00:36:37,482
Thank you.

537
00:37:01,282 --> 00:37:03,122
(Li Cheng Xuan)

538
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,482
(Cheng Yao, cheer up.)

539
00:37:05,798 --> 00:37:08,080
(You don't want to be looked down upon by your boyfriend, do you?)

540
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,311
(If you're not strong enough, you won't be treated fairly.)

541
00:37:25,432 --> 00:37:27,901
Hello. Is this Lawyer Li Cheng Xuan?

542
00:37:28,711 --> 00:37:30,122
I'm Cheng Yao.

543
00:37:30,944 --> 00:37:33,974
About the job offer last time, can I talk to you in person?

544
00:37:38,888 --> 00:37:40,098
Wu Jun.

545
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,960
I'm giving you a chance now.

546
00:37:42,231 --> 00:37:43,582
Call me back immediately.

547
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,122
You're dead.

548
00:38:12,711 --> 00:38:14,591
Eat slowly, eat less.

549
00:38:14,671 --> 00:38:15,949
This is your second serving.

550
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,240
Aren't you full?

551
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:19,762
I'm not full.

552
00:38:19,952 --> 00:38:21,162
Let me tell you, Cheng Xi.

553
00:38:21,327 --> 00:38:24,756
Beef contains a lot of myoglobin

554
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,642
which is very helpful for muscle building.

555
00:38:28,895 --> 00:38:30,901
But he's done with boxing.

556
00:38:31,023 --> 00:38:32,922
What's the point of building muscle now?

557
00:38:33,631 --> 00:38:35,261
The boxing ring is in the past.

558
00:38:36,134 --> 00:38:38,884
What if one day he's in a good mood and asks me to be his target?

559
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,242
So it's useful to build some muscle in advance.

560
00:38:41,551 --> 00:38:43,322
It'll increase my resistance.

561
00:38:44,832 --> 00:38:46,861
Don't worry. I've got your back.

562
00:38:49,992 --> 00:38:52,962
If you can't handle it, I'll take care of your inheritance.

563
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,231
You're waiting for a project from me.

564
00:39:01,832 --> 00:39:03,042
I'm just kidding.

565
00:39:03,352 --> 00:39:05,510
Qian Heng just wants someone close

566
00:39:05,591 --> 00:39:07,111
to release his emotions.

567
00:39:07,191 --> 00:39:08,582
He's just like a child.

568
00:39:08,678 --> 00:39:10,109
He won't really blame you.

569
00:39:10,316 --> 00:39:12,922
I know. Qian Heng is my best buddy.

570
00:39:13,047 --> 00:39:14,316
I never blamed him.

571
00:39:16,075 --> 00:39:18,240
It's only been two years since we broke up and you already have a new love.

572
00:39:18,312 --> 00:39:19,325
You jerk.

573
00:39:19,406 --> 00:39:21,002
When we were together,

574
00:39:21,114 --> 00:39:22,572
you called me "baby" every day.

575
00:39:22,653 --> 00:39:24,052
You said sweet words and made promises

576
00:39:24,133 --> 00:39:25,700
that we would be together forever.

577
00:39:25,802 --> 00:39:27,431
It turns out it was all a lie.

578
00:39:27,511 --> 00:39:30,071
How many fish are you on your hook now?

579
00:39:30,151 --> 00:39:32,431
Wu Jun, do you ever get tired of keeping so many fish?

580
00:39:32,528 --> 00:39:35,431
No. What's wrong with you three today?

581
00:39:35,512 --> 00:39:37,431
Didn't we all agree to break up?

582
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:40,091
And when I'm with you three, I'm single.

583
00:39:40,172 --> 00:39:41,693
I'm not with all three of you.

584
00:39:41,831 --> 00:39:42,882
Again?

585
00:39:43,342 --> 00:39:44,382
Jerk.

586
00:39:44,489 --> 00:39:45,511
Liar.

587
00:39:45,661 --> 00:39:46,682
Trash.

588
00:39:55,031 --> 00:39:56,242
Wipe it.

589
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:01,562
What's going on?

590
00:40:05,114 --> 00:40:07,482
- What's going on?   - Cheng Xi, please listen to my explanation.

591
00:40:07,632 --> 00:40:09,522
I truly don't understand what's happening today.

592
00:40:09,912 --> 00:40:12,431
I haven't been in contact with them for a very long time.

593
00:40:12,511 --> 00:40:15,282
When we broke up, we agreed to do it peacefully.

594
00:40:15,717 --> 00:40:18,307
I don't know why the three of them came together today

595
00:40:18,654 --> 00:40:20,364
to pick a fight with me.

596
00:40:21,432 --> 00:40:22,982
Your ex-girlfriends

597
00:40:23,832 --> 00:40:24,922
are pretty good-looking.

598
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:27,202
No way. They can't compare to you.

599
00:40:27,809 --> 00:40:29,539
In my heart, you are the most beautiful.

600
00:40:31,486 --> 00:40:34,315
Did you compare me to them?

601
00:40:34,741 --> 00:40:36,242
No.

602
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:38,700
Never.

603
00:40:38,781 --> 00:40:40,141
I never thought about them.

604
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,450
You are the only one in my heart.

605
00:40:42,671 --> 00:40:43,951
No, it's not a coincidence

606
00:40:44,031 --> 00:40:47,542
that so many ex-girlfriends showed up today.

607
00:40:47,671 --> 00:40:49,602
Someone must really hate you

608
00:40:49,726 --> 00:40:51,879
to go through all this trouble and expense.

609
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,042
Qian Heng?

610
00:41:01,606 --> 00:41:04,364
Fine. What I said to him was all in vain.

611
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,951
He's having problems with Cheng Yao.

612
00:41:07,261 --> 00:41:10,331
Why did he have to come and ruin our relationship?

613
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,349
Luckily you're so magnanimous.

614
00:41:15,752 --> 00:41:17,282
I'm not that magnanimous.

615
00:41:17,455 --> 00:41:19,586
When it comes to things like this, I'm pretty petty.

616
00:41:19,992 --> 00:41:23,028
No, I swear to you, from now on,

617
00:41:23,117 --> 00:41:25,797
I won't even think about or look at any other woman besides you.

618
00:41:25,966 --> 00:41:27,600
No, don't swear.

619
00:41:27,747 --> 00:41:30,362
It's raining outside. I'm worried you'll get struck by lightning.

620
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,682
Okay, then I'll touch some wood.

621
00:41:33,752 --> 00:41:35,962
- Wipe it.   - Okay.

622
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,911
(That's your price for simply hiring people.)

623
00:41:50,872 --> 00:41:55,792
If something really happens between Qian Heng and Cheng Yao,

624
00:41:55,872 --> 00:41:58,242
will Qian Heng sacrifice me to the gods?

625
00:41:59,231 --> 00:42:00,441
It's possible.

626
00:42:02,591 --> 00:42:03,801
It's possible?

627
00:42:11,049 --> 00:42:12,540
Lawyer Liang, yes.

628
00:42:12,621 --> 00:42:13,621
I'm Wu Jun.

629
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:15,471
Tomorrow morning,

630
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:17,737
come to my office, okay?

631
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:18,920
Okay.

632
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,482
Okay, I'll wait for you.

633
00:42:24,511 --> 00:42:26,362
The one who caused the problem should be the one to solve it.

634
00:42:27,151 --> 00:42:29,182
I have to think of a way to save myself.

635
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:36,741
Do you want to have a cup of tea first?

636
00:42:38,591 --> 00:42:39,801
Go ahead.

637
00:42:40,054 --> 00:42:41,524
How do you plan to handle me?

638
00:43:01,484 --> 00:43:02,913
Do you remember this photo?

639
00:43:04,712 --> 00:43:06,038
Every time I see this photo,

640
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:08,070
I can remember how you looked when you were in college.

641
00:43:09,006 --> 00:43:10,996
Proud and confident.

642
00:43:11,511 --> 00:43:13,402
You were the future star of the law faculty.

643
00:43:13,992 --> 00:43:15,631
Back then, the lecturers all liked you so much.

644
00:43:15,781 --> 00:43:17,012
Everyone believed

645
00:43:17,231 --> 00:43:19,881
that you would have a very bright future.

646
00:43:22,109 --> 00:43:25,842
I remember that plenty of girls were courting Qian Heng back then.

647
00:43:26,151 --> 00:43:29,162
You were the only one who could discuss cases with him.

648
00:43:29,636 --> 00:43:32,650
Back then, you told us that you would

649
00:43:32,731 --> 00:43:35,071
be the best female lawyer in the world after you graduate.

650
00:43:35,152 --> 00:43:36,402
- Enough.   - After that, you would...

651
00:43:37,809 --> 00:43:40,778
What's the point of mentioning the past now?

652
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,210
Of course there's a point.

653
00:43:43,543 --> 00:43:45,653
It reminds me of what you were like in the past.
