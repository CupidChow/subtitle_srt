1
00:01:35,653 --> 00:01:38,802
(My Boss)

2
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,937
(Episode 3)

3
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:44,842
(Is it because of Cheng Yao that I fell asleep?)

4
00:02:00,043 --> 00:02:01,575
Cheng Yao, wake up.

5
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:04,748
Wake up.

6
00:02:10,195 --> 00:02:11,195
I...

7
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,402
It's useless to kowtow to me.

8
00:02:16,571 --> 00:02:17,802
Good morning, boss.

9
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:20,482
Sorry, I didn't mean to sleep here.

10
00:02:20,698 --> 00:02:23,450
I wanted to cook you a meal yesterday to thank you.

11
00:02:23,531 --> 00:02:25,122
But when I got to the door, I heard you snoring.

12
00:02:25,203 --> 00:02:27,056
- You entered my room?   - How could that be?

13
00:02:27,137 --> 00:02:28,915
You were sleeping. How could I disturb you?

14
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,460
I planned to rest on the sofa for a while, waiting for you.

15
00:02:33,424 --> 00:02:35,574
But it was too warm inside

16
00:02:35,658 --> 00:02:37,802
and the sound of the rain outside was so soporific.

17
00:02:38,155 --> 00:02:39,802
I fell asleep without realizing it.

18
00:02:40,899 --> 00:02:42,648
The sound of the rain was soporific?

19
00:02:43,418 --> 00:02:44,682
Haven't you heard of it?

20
00:02:44,917 --> 00:02:47,802
432 Hertz is believed to be the most harmonious frequency in the universe.

21
00:02:47,973 --> 00:02:49,697
It is said that many people, upon hearing this sound,

22
00:02:49,778 --> 00:02:51,482
will experience a profound sense of tranquility.

23
00:02:51,606 --> 00:02:53,520
Many people use it as the background music for sleeping.

24
00:02:53,601 --> 00:02:54,741
I heard it's very effective.

25
00:02:55,418 --> 00:02:56,558
What kind of nonsense is that?

26
00:02:57,257 --> 00:02:58,357
What is this then?

27
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,680
It's for you.

28
00:03:01,155 --> 00:03:02,705
Leave my house as soon as possible.

29
00:03:04,258 --> 00:03:05,258
Boss.

30
00:03:05,779 --> 00:03:07,002
You're going to the office too.

31
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,399
Can you give me a ride?

32
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,231
Do I look like a charitable person?

33
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,842
I'm going to wash my face and leave immediately.

34
00:03:19,059 --> 00:03:21,150
(Is it because of Cheng Yao that I fell asleep?)

35
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,402
(Impossible.)

36
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,202
(It must be the wind and rain, the frequency.)

37
00:03:54,327 --> 00:03:56,830
(It's science. In any case, it definitely wasn't Cheng Yao.)

38
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:00,138
Cheng Yao, here.

39
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,800
What is this?

40
00:04:02,881 --> 00:04:04,962
Last night, Lawyer Qian called me to pass the file to you.

41
00:04:05,122 --> 00:04:06,979
You can officially work with us on the case now.

42
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,080
Really?

43
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:10,049
You worked on the right track and made gains.

44
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:13,276
I'll definitely work hard to not hold everyone back.

45
00:04:15,696 --> 00:04:16,962
What can you understand?

46
00:04:17,361 --> 00:04:19,922
Do you want me to give you some tips?

47
00:04:25,258 --> 00:04:27,648
No. How could Xu Jun be like this?

48
00:04:28,499 --> 00:04:29,802
You are still too young.

49
00:04:30,053 --> 00:04:31,322
After years as a family lawyer,

50
00:04:31,452 --> 00:04:33,006
you'll encounter countless things that challenge your beliefs.

51
00:04:33,087 --> 00:04:35,562
Xu Jun is the founder of Tuantuan Online.

52
00:04:35,787 --> 00:04:38,960
He's a businessman. It is quite common to conceal assets during a divorce.

53
00:04:39,049 --> 00:04:40,709
That's not what I'm talking about.

54
00:04:40,859 --> 00:04:42,178
I'm talking about Bai Xing Meng.

55
00:04:42,266 --> 00:04:43,642
Do you know Bai Xing Meng?

56
00:04:45,137 --> 00:04:46,377
What Meng?

57
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:48,183
She's the female lead in the Ling Yao Strategy.

58
00:04:48,295 --> 00:04:49,562
It's a popular drama recently.

59
00:04:50,531 --> 00:04:52,042
They had a rumor before.

60
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:54,039
I know her.

61
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,402
She had a rumor.

62
00:04:55,499 --> 00:04:56,682
It's normal.

63
00:04:56,873 --> 00:04:58,898
It's normal. It's normal for female celebrities to have rumors.

64
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:00,296
I know a lot of them.

65
00:05:00,377 --> 00:05:01,682
No.

66
00:05:02,398 --> 00:05:04,509
It's the timing of their rumors.

67
00:05:05,002 --> 00:05:07,602
When they had rumors, it should have been two years ago, right?

68
00:05:07,746 --> 00:05:09,676
But the records say Xu Jun got married three years ago

69
00:05:09,757 --> 00:05:11,188
and divorced one year ago.

70
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:13,043
She was in a very popular drama.

71
00:05:13,124 --> 00:05:15,433
I remember it clearly. It was two years ago.

72
00:05:15,904 --> 00:05:17,425
You remember the timeline so clearly.

73
00:05:17,506 --> 00:05:19,373
Looks like Lawyer Qian didn't pick the wrong person.

74
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,702
No. I really like Bai Xing Meng.

75
00:05:24,346 --> 00:05:26,682
No way. She must have been tricked.

76
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:27,979
Yes.

77
00:05:29,258 --> 00:05:30,848
Luckily, I only fancy Lawyer Qian.

78
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,161
Perfect self-discipline personality.

79
00:05:32,282 --> 00:05:33,462
Never fail us.

80
00:05:34,377 --> 00:05:35,882
Want to be Lawyer Qian's fans?

81
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,623
With a change in mentality, the work progressed smoothly.

82
00:05:38,704 --> 00:05:40,253
Overtime is a fan benefit.

83
00:05:40,605 --> 00:05:44,002
Also, in order to let you fully experience my care,

84
00:05:44,121 --> 00:05:48,122
I decided to officially pull you into our Glory and Wealth group.

85
00:05:48,396 --> 00:05:49,986
What is Glory and Wealth?

86
00:05:53,322 --> 00:05:54,461
Joining Lawyer Qian's team

87
00:05:54,542 --> 00:05:57,414
is like starting a romantic journey with glory and wealth.

88
00:05:57,495 --> 00:05:59,042
Just follow the boss, work hard,

89
00:05:59,144 --> 00:06:00,893
and you'll surely make money.

90
00:06:01,642 --> 00:06:03,402
No need to look. Lawyer Qian is not here.

91
00:06:03,494 --> 00:06:07,205
His love for Lawyer Qian comes from the heart, inside and out.

92
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,122
(Welcome, the esteemed Lawyer Cheng, to our Glory and Wealth group.)

93
00:06:17,059 --> 00:06:20,122
(No. Tan Ying, I'm still a rookie.)

94
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,344
(One should have dreams in life.)

95
00:06:22,425 --> 00:06:24,762
(You've made it to Junheng & Co, and with my help,)

96
00:06:24,874 --> 00:06:26,802
(becoming a great lawyer is just a matter of time.)

97
00:06:29,433 --> 00:06:31,820
(Why do I have this bad feeling?)

98
00:06:32,018 --> 00:06:34,498
(Is the hard times coming?)

99
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:35,691
(We all have been through this.)

100
00:06:35,772 --> 00:06:37,242
(You'll get used to it sooner or later.)

101
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,242
(You've been in the company for four years.)

102
00:06:39,354 --> 00:06:40,573
(Have you gotten used to it?)

103
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,602
(Almost.)

104
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,840
(Bao Rui,)

105
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,562
(you made many typos.)

106
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,482
(You still need to be more rigorous.)

107
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,122
Stop that. Are you a language teacher?

108
00:06:55,201 --> 00:06:56,341
You were the one who was not rigorous.

109
00:06:56,422 --> 00:06:57,642
I'll kick you out.

110
00:08:19,977 --> 00:08:21,202
Hello.

111
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:22,833
Is this a housekeeping company?

112
00:08:22,921 --> 00:08:25,122
I'm looking for a housekeeper to cook supper for me.

113
00:08:32,242 --> 00:08:34,739
Madam. Can you make the cooking sound a bit louder?

114
00:08:34,831 --> 00:08:37,222
Make some noise with the pots and pans.

115
00:08:38,773 --> 00:08:39,773
Okay.

116
00:08:53,844 --> 00:08:55,322
Can you make it louder?

117
00:08:57,146 --> 00:08:59,402
Young man. If you're sick, go get treatment.

118
00:08:59,496 --> 00:09:01,278
Creating a nuisance in the middle of the night

119
00:09:01,411 --> 00:09:02,661
is a lack of manners.

120
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,451
I'm not going to serve you.

121
00:09:35,656 --> 00:09:37,127
I just close my eyes and I'm asleep.

122
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:38,753
My adaptability is strong.

123
00:09:38,858 --> 00:09:40,608
I can fall asleep anywhere.

124
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:52,303
I'm not dancing. I'm doing calisthenics.

125
00:09:52,685 --> 00:09:54,754
It's too cold. I want to warm up my body.

126
00:10:27,802 --> 00:10:29,167
My adaptability is strong.

127
00:10:29,248 --> 00:10:30,842
I can fall asleep anywhere.

128
00:10:34,341 --> 00:10:35,759
Wake up.

129
00:10:35,871 --> 00:10:37,071
How did you fall asleep here?

130
00:10:39,376 --> 00:10:40,549
Sorry, sir.

131
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,362
What can I get for you?

132
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,762
Sorry.

133
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:47,809
I'll take this one.

134
00:10:49,044 --> 00:10:50,479
Or would you like to try this one?

135
00:10:50,599 --> 00:10:52,282
It's very energizing.

136
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:55,259
Okay.

137
00:10:58,578 --> 00:10:59,682
Here.

138
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:22,042
(Here comes another one.)

139
00:11:22,255 --> 00:11:23,882
(Was it the effect of sleeping pills?)

140
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,901
Hey.

141
00:11:45,794 --> 00:11:49,623
Sorry, I've been really busy with work these past few days.

142
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,882
Okay. I'll contact you as soon as I have time.

143
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:01,955
(I've hit a bottleneck with the case.)

144
00:12:02,036 --> 00:12:04,482
(I don't even have time to go look at houses.)

145
00:12:05,432 --> 00:12:07,512
(Do I have to stay in the firm forever?)

146
00:12:23,001 --> 00:12:24,102
Boss.

147
00:12:24,792 --> 00:12:26,422
You're here to work overtime again?

148
00:12:38,786 --> 00:12:39,882
What's wrong?

149
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,675
What are you doing?

150
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,224
Real people.

151
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:54,018
It's best not to stay in the office.

152
00:12:54,098 --> 00:12:55,278
Do you want to spread viruses?

153
00:12:58,539 --> 00:13:00,364
He has a sharp tongue,

154
00:13:00,445 --> 00:13:02,235
but his heart is still good.

155
00:13:13,663 --> 00:13:15,734
Thinking also consumes energy.

156
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:17,270
Don't be too hard on yourself.

157
00:13:31,294 --> 00:13:33,680
Boss, I'm going to make a self-heating pot. Do you want some?

158
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,019
No need. Go out.

159
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,002
That's awful.

160
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:05,922
It smells so good.

161
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,338
It smells so good.

162
00:15:22,817 --> 00:15:24,504
Some people just can't have it.

163
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,282
I'll just enjoy it myself.

164
00:15:44,267 --> 00:15:46,096
What a spectacle.

165
00:15:46,228 --> 00:15:48,799
The 24 hours a day, seven days a week hexagon warrior,

166
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,880
Lawyer Qian, fell asleep in the office.

167
00:15:52,082 --> 00:15:54,002
Even a sage has moments of weakness.

168
00:15:54,113 --> 00:15:55,704
He must be too tired.

169
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:00,078
How could he not be tired staying up late and working overtime every day?

170
00:16:00,695 --> 00:16:02,766
How do you know he stays up late and works overtime every day?

171
00:16:04,419 --> 00:16:05,658
I mean yesterday.

172
00:16:05,738 --> 00:16:07,262
I was working overtime yesterday too.

173
00:16:10,108 --> 00:16:11,577
I have to take a picture.

174
00:16:13,716 --> 00:16:15,699
This is a phenomenon-level scene.

175
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:17,602
It's a once-in-a-century opportunity.

176
00:16:18,419 --> 00:16:19,439
What are you looking at?

177
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:22,079
Nothing.

178
00:16:22,818 --> 00:16:24,122
Let me take a look too.

179
00:16:48,864 --> 00:16:50,122
Everyone, listen to me.

180
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:53,294
Didn't our firm recently get three new colleagues?

181
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,618
So I want to have a welcome party in the evening.

182
00:16:55,738 --> 00:16:57,642
Let's all go together after work.

183
00:16:57,939 --> 00:16:59,299
Thank you, Lawyer Wu.

184
00:16:59,442 --> 00:17:00,698
Invite any relatives or friends.

185
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:02,019
Let's all have a good time.

186
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,130
Okay.

187
00:17:04,018 --> 00:17:05,018
Cheng Yao.

188
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,550
Don't you have a sister?

189
00:17:07,403 --> 00:17:08,582
Invite her to come along.

190
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,680
Okay.

191
00:17:10,778 --> 00:17:11,778
Good.

192
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:23,202
Boss, I'm going to make a self-heating pot. Do you want some?

193
00:17:32,737 --> 00:17:35,202
(Could it be true that Cheng Yao made me fall asleep?)

194
00:17:45,178 --> 00:17:46,282
Qian.

195
00:17:46,563 --> 00:17:48,122
Don't take it to heart.

196
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:50,218
Occasionally losing face in front of colleagues

197
00:17:50,321 --> 00:17:51,751
can build relationships.

198
00:17:52,025 --> 00:17:53,926
I don't need to build relationships with my colleagues.

199
00:17:55,964 --> 00:17:57,362
That's really conscienceless.

200
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:59,589
Who just resolved a crisis for you?

201
00:18:00,797 --> 00:18:03,362
Everyone on the street knows what's in Sima Zhao's mind.

202
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:05,279
Fine.

203
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,962
But speaking of which,

204
00:18:07,217 --> 00:18:10,018
you were sleeping so soundly just now.

205
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:11,229
That made me curious.

206
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:12,458
Besides me,

207
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:14,609
who else can cure your insomnia?

208
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:18,697
I won't tell you.

209
00:18:33,409 --> 00:18:34,588
Where is Cheng Yao?

210
00:18:35,298 --> 00:18:36,842
She went to eat during her lunch break.

211
00:18:37,215 --> 00:18:39,322
You don't need a nap. Don't let people rest, huh?

212
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:53,458
So tasty.

213
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:08,456
(Ting Ting, the ramen shop downstairs from us is really good.)

214
00:19:08,537 --> 00:19:10,002
(I'll treat you there some other day.)

215
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:17,802
(Come back to the office for a bit. Something's up.)

216
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,041
That's crazy.

217
00:19:20,122 --> 00:19:21,682
Even during lunch break, he wouldn't let me go.

218
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,101
I'm going to ignore you.

219
00:19:37,734 --> 00:19:38,762
Cheng Yao.

220
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:40,618
It's you? How coincidental.

221
00:19:40,698 --> 00:19:41,760
I am

222
00:19:42,562 --> 00:19:44,018
your high school classmate, Wu Chen.

223
00:19:44,122 --> 00:19:45,591
I was just worried I wouldn't have a seat.

224
00:19:45,737 --> 00:19:47,208
Would you mind sharing a table?

225
00:19:47,481 --> 00:19:48,481
Please sit.

226
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:54,002
We haven't seen each other since high school graduation.

227
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:55,898
So you're working around here too?

228
00:19:56,001 --> 00:19:57,432
I'm at the law firm upstairs.

229
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:00,378
So you're a lawyer now.

230
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:01,819
I just started working.

231
00:20:01,899 --> 00:20:02,998
That's great.

232
00:20:08,985 --> 00:20:11,082
You're a lawyer.

233
00:20:11,181 --> 00:20:12,779
Can you help me out?

234
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:14,210
It's like this.

235
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,718
My leader's mom

236
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,959
recently invested nearly 2 million in a P2P online lending platform.

237
00:20:20,055 --> 00:20:22,682
And then this P2P company exploded.

238
00:20:23,854 --> 00:20:25,379
His mom was so worried that she ended up in the hospital.

239
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,809
You're a lawyer.

240
00:20:27,182 --> 00:20:29,779
Can you tell me what should people do

241
00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:31,328
in their situation to protect their rights?

242
00:20:32,349 --> 00:20:35,842
I'm not in this field.

243
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:39,120
You can ask your leader to consult a professional lawyer

244
00:20:39,201 --> 00:20:41,070
for financial fraud.

245
00:20:42,778 --> 00:20:44,442
Why do you speak in such a formal manner?

246
00:20:44,533 --> 00:20:46,562
I just asked you because you're my classmate.

247
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,602
Lawyers like you won't answer without charging, right?

248
00:20:50,859 --> 00:20:53,419
- No, it's because I'm not really...   - Dude.

249
00:20:54,139 --> 00:20:55,768
What department should you go to

250
00:20:55,978 --> 00:20:57,369
when you have a stomach illness?

251
00:20:58,018 --> 00:20:59,480
Gastroenterology.

252
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,978
- What's wrong? You...   - So you knew it?

253
00:21:02,097 --> 00:21:04,532
She said she doesn't provide financial fraud services.

254
00:21:04,859 --> 00:21:06,808
But you kept pushing her to give you legal advice.

255
00:21:06,978 --> 00:21:08,279
When you have a stomach problem,

256
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,922
why don't you go to a proctologist for medical attention?

257
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:15,484
Even if you find a gastroenterologist,

258
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:16,697
you still have to make an appointment, right?

259
00:21:16,778 --> 00:21:17,859
You don't want to spend a penny

260
00:21:17,939 --> 00:21:19,199
and still get a free ride, huh?

261
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,019
No. I'm just chatting with my old classmate.

262
00:21:22,099 --> 00:21:23,152
What business is it of yours?

263
00:21:23,233 --> 00:21:24,753
- Who are you?   - I'm her boss.

264
00:21:24,899 --> 00:21:28,308
Her time is mine. I won't allow her to waste it on someone like you.

265
00:21:28,389 --> 00:21:29,468
Free consultation.

266
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:31,618
Why don't you just ask her to resign?

267
00:21:31,698 --> 00:21:33,651
Also, her professional expertise is in family law.

268
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:35,320
You can seek her out when you decide to get a divorce.

269
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,728
As her boss, I can ask her to give you a discount.

270
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,627
Sorry, I have a meeting.

271
00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:41,419
I'll go first.

272
00:21:55,095 --> 00:21:57,085
The way you're looking at me seems quite strange.

273
00:22:02,424 --> 00:22:03,562
But boss,

274
00:22:03,643 --> 00:22:06,682
what if he is someone I used to be good friends with?

275
00:22:06,774 --> 00:22:08,539
If you talk to him like that, I would be embarrassed.

276
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,948
A true friend wouldn't think of taking advantage of you.

277
00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:14,259
Besides, he doesn't even know your usual work scope.

278
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:15,649
What a great friend he could be.

279
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:20,853
What if he is someone I used to like in school?

280
00:22:21,697 --> 00:22:23,400
You like someone who likes to curry favor,

281
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,362
benefiting from someone else's efforts and a sordid merchant.

282
00:22:25,484 --> 00:22:26,618
Are you blind?

283
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:28,278
Makes sense.

284
00:22:29,498 --> 00:22:31,019
Four years of undergraduate law school.

285
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,618
That's about 35,040 hours.

286
00:22:33,744 --> 00:22:36,694
One year of lawyer internship is about 8,760 hours.

287
00:22:36,859 --> 00:22:39,378
Every lawyer has to go through 43,380 hours

288
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,898
to get their lawyer license.

289
00:22:40,978 --> 00:22:43,059
Time is the biggest cost for every lawyer.

290
00:22:43,139 --> 00:22:44,978
Doing a one-minute free consultation for such people

291
00:22:45,075 --> 00:22:47,218
is equivalent to wasting one minute of life.

292
00:22:47,321 --> 00:22:49,562
Every minute and every second of time is irreplaceable.

293
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,177
Next time, I will definitely refuse properly.

294
00:22:52,275 --> 00:22:54,968
Not only should you refuse, but you must refuse with the worst attitude.

295
00:22:55,229 --> 00:22:57,458
We don't need to respect those who don't respect

296
00:22:57,539 --> 00:22:58,839
the professional value of lawyers.

297
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:03,477
But boss,

298
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:05,433
you usually come here to eat noodles, right?

299
00:23:07,516 --> 00:23:09,322
Wasn't that invitation to the restaurant sent by you to me?

300
00:23:11,659 --> 00:23:14,090
No, I sent it to my good friend.

301
00:23:18,579 --> 00:23:21,246
Boss, I was just sending a WeChat message to my friend.

302
00:23:21,327 --> 00:23:22,658
I accidentally sent it to you.

303
00:23:22,738 --> 00:23:24,002
Sorry, I sent it to the wrong person.

304
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,602
It's okay. It just so happens that I have something to tell you.

305
00:23:27,378 --> 00:23:30,242
I know that being a lawyer is a very challenging and hardworking job.

306
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:32,008
Many people can't persist.

307
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,802
- I will try my best.   - No.

308
00:23:34,988 --> 00:23:37,040
I think you have no talent in becoming a lawyer.

309
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,882
It's better for you to switch to be my life assistant.

310
00:23:39,316 --> 00:23:40,800
How about this? You move back to my place.

311
00:23:40,938 --> 00:23:42,082
And I will pay you the salary.

312
00:23:42,778 --> 00:23:44,306
Life assistant?

313
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,162
It's about taking care of my daily life.

314
00:23:46,288 --> 00:23:48,618
For example, the drain is blocked, and I need you to unclog it.

315
00:23:48,742 --> 00:23:50,562
But, I don't know how to unclog it.

316
00:23:50,738 --> 00:23:51,919
Do you think I know?

317
00:23:55,738 --> 00:23:58,162
Being appreciated by the boss is great of course.

318
00:23:58,243 --> 00:24:00,033
But, I still want to be a lawyer.

319
00:24:02,939 --> 00:24:04,362
Boss, the noodles here are really delicious.

320
00:24:04,491 --> 00:24:05,802
Do you want me to get you a bowl?

321
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:07,938
No need. Come right after work.

322
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:10,209
Fix the drain. If it is delayed any longer,

323
00:24:10,508 --> 00:24:12,767
I'll consider asking you to compensate for my time loss.

324
00:24:29,827 --> 00:24:31,600
Boss, it's done.

325
00:24:31,939 --> 00:24:33,978
This is the drain cleaner I bought for you.

326
00:24:34,077 --> 00:24:36,498
If any pipes get blocked afterward, you can use this.

327
00:24:36,698 --> 00:24:38,259
Pour a bit of this in and flush it with water.

328
00:24:38,369 --> 00:24:39,369
Got it.

329
00:24:42,058 --> 00:24:43,199
Can I

330
00:24:43,498 --> 00:24:44,739
discuss something with you?

331
00:24:44,873 --> 00:24:46,099
There's a welcome party tonight.

332
00:24:46,194 --> 00:24:48,144
I still have some clothes inside.

333
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:49,938
I'll go change them.

334
00:24:50,018 --> 00:24:51,278
I'll leave right after I'm done.

335
00:24:51,978 --> 00:24:52,998
Thank you, boss.

336
00:24:58,058 --> 00:24:59,278
Boss,

337
00:24:59,819 --> 00:25:01,558
how did my luggage end up in there?

338
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,900
I brought it back.

339
00:25:04,471 --> 00:25:06,433
You living in the firm will affect the company's image.

340
00:25:06,561 --> 00:25:08,482
I'm giving you a chance to move back in.

341
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:32,491
Meng Ting.

342
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,362
Listen. It's too weird.

343
00:25:34,475 --> 00:25:36,282
Qian Heng actually asked me to move back in.

344
00:25:37,186 --> 00:25:38,186
Oh my.

345
00:25:38,651 --> 00:25:42,618
Suddenly, I remembered a case I had seen in a legal program before.

346
00:25:42,698 --> 00:25:45,618
(There was a guy who had a conflict with his former colleague.)

347
00:25:45,699 --> 00:25:48,329
(After that, his former colleague threatened to kill him.)

348
00:25:49,107 --> 00:25:52,987
Then, this man deceived a new colleague to go home with him.

349
00:25:53,068 --> 00:25:54,587
(But, when the new colleague got home,)

350
00:25:54,668 --> 00:25:56,989
- (he was killed by the former colleague.)   - Stop it.

351
00:25:57,099 --> 00:25:58,938
Qian Heng has offended so many people

352
00:25:59,019 --> 00:26:00,890
and received so many threatening letters.

353
00:26:01,658 --> 00:26:03,202
Could it be that he really

354
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:04,610
encountered a psychopathic killer?

355
00:26:04,691 --> 00:26:06,211
I'm telling you, it's possible.

356
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:08,099
Think about it. He's so rich.

357
00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:10,099
It's over. If he really didn't encounter any issues,

358
00:26:10,179 --> 00:26:12,482
why did he compete for the rental house with you, huh?

359
00:26:12,778 --> 00:26:15,162
(Which one is better to live in, the mansion or the flat?)

360
00:26:15,489 --> 00:26:17,360
I knew he wasn't kind.

361
00:26:17,698 --> 00:26:18,998
I won't chat with you anymore.

362
00:26:22,541 --> 00:26:23,962
Let me change my clothes first.

363
00:26:30,563 --> 00:26:31,623
Boss.

364
00:26:32,058 --> 00:26:33,579
I don't think it's convenient to stay here.

365
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:35,048
I'm going to the welcome party.

366
00:26:45,579 --> 00:26:47,499
Actually, it was the pole that was wrong. What about this?

367
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:49,618
You use the pole. I use the cane. Okay?

368
00:26:49,698 --> 00:26:50,938
I'll use my cane to play with you.

369
00:26:51,056 --> 00:26:52,242
Go play by yourself.

370
00:26:52,538 --> 00:26:53,598
Yu Fei, come on.

371
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:54,819
Okay.

372
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,919
Let's go. Can you play?

373
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,001
No problem, I'll use my cane.

374
00:26:58,082 --> 00:26:59,282
Lawyer Wu, sorry. I'm late.

375
00:26:59,363 --> 00:27:00,463
It's okay.

376
00:27:01,284 --> 00:27:03,362
Your sister went to look for parking?

377
00:27:03,778 --> 00:27:05,808
I forgot to tell you my sister can't come.

378
00:27:05,978 --> 00:27:07,059
Sorry about that.

379
00:27:07,139 --> 00:27:08,159
She can't come?

380
00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:12,619
Is that so?

381
00:27:12,778 --> 00:27:14,568
I guess I was late to inform you.

382
00:27:14,939 --> 00:27:15,939
Right.

383
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:19,169
So, what about this, Cheng Yao?

384
00:27:19,778 --> 00:27:20,881
Can you update your family's information,

385
00:27:20,962 --> 00:27:24,131
like your sister's contact information, in our new employee system?

386
00:27:24,381 --> 00:27:26,977
Next time when there's a major event, I'll come to inform you personally.

387
00:27:27,058 --> 00:27:28,562
- Okay?   - All right.

388
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,362
- Come on.   - I'll update now.

389
00:27:35,794 --> 00:27:38,242
So, take it slow. No rush.

390
00:27:48,057 --> 00:27:49,457
(The contact list has been updated)

391
00:28:00,562 --> 00:28:02,514
(Cheng Xi)

392
00:28:02,608 --> 00:28:03,762
(Friend request)

393
00:28:14,867 --> 00:28:16,666
- What are you doing?   - What are you doing?

394
00:28:16,754 --> 00:28:17,774
I'm not doing anything.

395
00:28:18,992 --> 00:28:20,381
You're acting weird.

396
00:28:20,796 --> 00:28:22,482
Is there something going on in our group?

397
00:28:23,486 --> 00:28:24,880
Nothing. I just want you guys to leave earlier.

398
00:28:24,961 --> 00:28:26,441
I have to take on the work by myself.

399
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,099
Don't take it on yourself.

400
00:28:28,179 --> 00:28:30,562
No big deal. I won't drink tonight. I'll take it on with you.

401
00:28:30,666 --> 00:28:32,218
- No need.   - I can help carry too.

402
00:28:32,298 --> 00:28:33,768
What are you trying to carry?

403
00:28:34,802 --> 00:28:37,242
(Friend request has been approved. You can now start chatting.)

404
00:28:37,334 --> 00:28:38,402
No need to carry.

405
00:28:41,058 --> 00:28:42,642
It's okay. Hey!

406
00:28:43,102 --> 00:28:45,202
Let's have fun today!

407
00:28:45,283 --> 00:28:46,303
Have fun.

408
00:28:47,579 --> 00:28:50,002
Help me and the new employees take a picture together.

409
00:28:50,122 --> 00:28:51,360
- Okay?   - Sure.

410
00:28:51,453 --> 00:28:53,497
Come on. This month's new employees. Come on.

411
00:28:53,578 --> 00:28:56,019
Let's take a picture. Cheng Yao, stand with me. Come on.

412
00:28:56,099 --> 00:28:57,458
We did buy flowers? Right?

413
00:28:57,538 --> 00:28:59,484
- Yes.   - Let's give the best one to Cheng Yao.

414
00:28:59,565 --> 00:29:01,242
- Thank you.   - Welcome, everyone.

415
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:03,968
- Great!   - Come closer.

416
00:29:04,081 --> 00:29:05,962
Three, two, one.

417
00:29:06,777 --> 00:29:08,258
- Does it look nice?   - It looks nice.

418
00:29:08,339 --> 00:29:09,499
Thanks, everyone. Thank you all.

419
00:29:09,579 --> 00:29:10,978
- I look handsome.   - Welcome.

420
00:29:11,058 --> 00:29:12,178
I'll edit it and send it to you.

421
00:29:12,258 --> 00:29:13,458
No need to edit. Send it to me now.

422
00:29:13,538 --> 00:29:15,099
Original picture, quickly. Hurry up.

423
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:16,968
What are you in such a hurry for?

424
00:29:17,955 --> 00:29:19,722
Cheng Yao, you look so cute in this picture.

425
00:29:28,247 --> 00:29:32,997
(Welcoming the new employees.)

426
00:29:57,539 --> 00:29:58,539
Everyone.

427
00:29:58,859 --> 00:29:59,898
I'm really sorry.

428
00:29:59,978 --> 00:30:01,819
Just now, suddenly something came up.

429
00:30:01,899 --> 00:30:03,019
I need to go.

430
00:30:03,099 --> 00:30:05,978
Well, I won't be joining you all today. Do as you please.

431
00:30:06,058 --> 00:30:08,919
But, all the expenses today will be on my tab.

432
00:30:09,376 --> 00:30:11,687
All right.

433
00:30:12,738 --> 00:30:14,362
Yu Fei and Bao Rui, take care of everyone.

434
00:30:14,443 --> 00:30:15,764
Yes.

435
00:30:15,845 --> 00:30:17,242
You can rest assured.

436
00:30:17,339 --> 00:30:19,326
- Rest assured, Lawyer Wu.   - Come on, let's have some fun.

437
00:30:19,407 --> 00:30:20,978
No wonder he is Junheng & Co's partner.

438
00:30:21,058 --> 00:30:22,826
He's so happy when it comes to work.

439
00:30:22,907 --> 00:30:25,688
I invited two elite lawyers from other law firms

440
00:30:26,179 --> 00:30:27,618
who are already seniors.

441
00:30:27,698 --> 00:30:30,499
They are also well-known as the most eligible bachelors in our circle.

442
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,898
Cheng Yao, you should make your move when the time comes.

443
00:30:32,978 --> 00:30:34,418
Don't be polite to me.

444
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,520
What are you up to?

445
00:30:35,658 --> 00:30:37,248
Don't be afraid. I'll protect you.

446
00:30:39,099 --> 00:30:41,318
Why don't you introduce me?

447
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:44,008
I'm introducing the most eligible bachelors.

448
00:30:44,139 --> 00:30:45,439
I'm not responsible for the bronze ones

449
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:47,179
Hah, nice one.

450
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,383
But, isn't your leg injury not healed yet? You're already up and about.

451
00:30:50,464 --> 00:30:52,302
- Yeah, that's right.   - Well.

452
00:30:52,588 --> 00:30:55,842
I have a nickname in this industry, called the Nightclub Package.

453
00:30:55,985 --> 00:30:57,854
You can just call me Package.

454
00:30:58,836 --> 00:31:01,014
Back then, I danced in a wheelchair.

455
00:31:01,095 --> 00:31:02,522
Now, I'm using a crutch.

456
00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:05,059
Don't talk about disco dancing, even bungee jumping is not a problem.

457
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,998
- Come on, let's play some pool.   - Come on.

458
00:31:07,141 --> 00:31:08,922
Mr. Bao is undaunted by his disability.

459
00:31:09,018 --> 00:31:10,488
He likes to come to places like this.

460
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,051
And, he doesn't like to work.

461
00:31:12,139 --> 00:31:13,562
Let's tell Lawyer Qian later.

462
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,805
If you dare to mention it, I dare to kick you out. I'll kick you out now.

463
00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:16,956
See?

464
00:31:17,037 --> 00:31:20,507
Having stayed with Lawyer Qian for a long time, it's quite stressful.

465
00:31:21,099 --> 00:31:22,439
- Bao Rui.   - I'm sure I can do it.

466
00:31:24,116 --> 00:31:26,762
Here they come. Let me introduce them to you.

467
00:31:27,203 --> 00:31:29,602
Li Cheng Xuan from Jincheng & Co.

468
00:31:29,698 --> 00:31:31,762
He specializes in family law as well.

469
00:31:31,907 --> 00:31:33,842
- You just became their partner last month, right?   - Yes.

470
00:31:34,076 --> 00:31:35,586
He is Zhang Yang.

471
00:31:35,868 --> 00:31:37,617
He is an expert in inheritance law.

472
00:31:37,698 --> 00:31:40,512
He just settled a case with a huge legal fee last month.

473
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,781
This is Cheng Yao,

474
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:43,990
the newcomer.

475
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:45,920
Tan Ying. You guys met before.

476
00:31:46,018 --> 00:31:47,458
This one doesn't matter.

477
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:49,259
Yu Fei. We've met before.

478
00:31:49,339 --> 00:31:51,922
- Let's play one game. I'm using a crutch.   - Come on.

479
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,689
- What's wrong with your leg?   - My leg is fine, just a minor injury.

480
00:31:55,714 --> 00:31:58,202
(There are many factors that cause insomnia.)

481
00:31:58,446 --> 00:32:01,209
(The most important one concerns psychological factors.)

482
00:32:01,436 --> 00:32:04,717
(In daily life, frequent emotional excitement)

483
00:32:04,867 --> 00:32:08,146
(or persistent mental tension can cause emotional unrest.)

484
00:32:08,234 --> 00:32:10,562
(This can also lead to worsening insomnia.)

485
00:32:10,738 --> 00:32:14,250
(Sometimes, overly focusing on sleep can be a problem)

486
00:32:14,404 --> 00:32:17,515
(and the anxiety it produces can also worsen insomnia.)

487
00:32:17,803 --> 00:32:20,433
(It can also make insomnia persist.)

488
00:32:20,993 --> 00:32:23,442
(There are many factors that cause insomnia.)

489
00:32:49,485 --> 00:32:51,259
- You're wrong.   - You really can't drink alcohol.

490
00:32:51,339 --> 00:32:54,956
- You must take medicine, right?   - No. I twisted my ankle, see?

491
00:32:55,037 --> 00:32:56,842
- Hello.   - (Cheng Yao.)

492
00:32:57,187 --> 00:32:58,602
The drain is blocked again.

493
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:01,362
I just unclogged it. Why is it blocked again?

494
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,214
It must be because you didn't unclog it properly.

495
00:33:04,778 --> 00:33:06,808
You should find the landlord or the property management.

496
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,362
(Thanks for the welcome party from the firm.)

497
00:33:19,443 --> 00:33:20,522
(Love you all.)

498
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:30,762
Your last case was pretty good.

499
00:33:30,819 --> 00:33:32,202
It's almost over. It's been two months.

500
00:33:32,292 --> 00:33:34,812
You communicate first. I'm using the restroom. I can't hold it anymore.

501
00:33:34,893 --> 00:33:36,086
Why are you using the restroom again?

502
00:33:36,205 --> 00:33:37,816
I'm going to poop. Are you happy?

503
00:33:38,289 --> 00:33:42,202
Be honest. I bet you won't work more than half a year with Qian Heng.

504
00:33:42,522 --> 00:33:45,082
Cheng Yao, tell me when you want to switch jobs.

505
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:48,002
We are also a boutique law firm specializing in family matters.

506
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:49,440
The atmosphere among colleagues is very good.

507
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,162
I also often communicate with my subordinates.

508
00:33:51,243 --> 00:33:53,379
I definitely won't put on a cold front.

509
00:33:53,633 --> 00:33:55,602
If you come to our firm, you will know that

510
00:33:55,683 --> 00:33:57,930
although we are both lawyers and both partners,

511
00:33:58,031 --> 00:34:01,082
there can be significant differences between people.

512
00:34:02,618 --> 00:34:03,618
Li Cheng Xuan,

513
00:34:05,018 --> 00:34:06,328
long time no see.

514
00:34:08,779 --> 00:34:10,219
The last time I saw you

515
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,071
was about two months ago, for the inheritance dispute case.

516
00:34:13,152 --> 00:34:17,561
You lost the trial as the opposing party's representative at the time.

517
00:34:18,859 --> 00:34:22,149
No, it was the custody dispute case from a month ago.

518
00:34:22,362 --> 00:34:23,421
Two children.

519
00:34:23,618 --> 00:34:27,368
In the end, you didn't even have custody of a child for your client.

520
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,002
It's indeed true that there can be significant differences between people,

521
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:33,322
even if they are partners.

522
00:34:35,178 --> 00:34:36,659
Come on, Qian Heng.

523
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:38,590
It's rare to meet you. Let's have a drink.

524
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,242
What case have you been busy with recently?

525
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:42,619
Are you going to compete with me for the case source?

526
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:45,270
Don't worry. I won't compete with you for the case source.

527
00:34:45,538 --> 00:34:48,202
I won't take any cases with a target amount of less than 50 million.

528
00:34:50,548 --> 00:34:52,482
It's so quiet. What's going on?

529
00:34:53,336 --> 00:34:54,475
Drinking in silence?

530
00:34:58,058 --> 00:34:59,239
Bao Rui.

531
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,699
You twisted your foot and applied for working from home.

532
00:35:02,779 --> 00:35:03,999
Why did you come here?

533
00:35:06,339 --> 00:35:07,478
Boss, it's like this.

534
00:35:07,699 --> 00:35:09,498
Just now I received a message from Cheng Yao

535
00:35:09,578 --> 00:35:10,978
saying that you came to the party.

536
00:35:11,058 --> 00:35:12,999
I must be there everywhere you go.

537
00:35:13,339 --> 00:35:15,098
I quickly asked my parents to help me get up.

538
00:35:15,178 --> 00:35:16,478
I booked a ride and came over.

539
00:35:16,578 --> 00:35:17,969
My leg isn't so convenient to walk.

540
00:35:18,058 --> 00:35:19,162
I just arrived.

541
00:35:19,307 --> 00:35:20,896
Sorry for being late.

542
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,080
Boss.

543
00:35:25,178 --> 00:35:26,898
You usually don't join this kind of activity.

544
00:35:26,978 --> 00:35:28,808
What wind blew you here?

545
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:31,228
My drain is clogged.

546
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:32,639
I'm looking for a plumber.

547
00:35:36,636 --> 00:35:37,756
You're a good boss.

548
00:35:37,883 --> 00:35:40,495
Look. You're obviously taking care of your subordinates.

549
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,880
But, you said the drain was blocked.

550
00:35:42,001 --> 00:35:43,831
This doesn't make any sense.

551
00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:45,649
Let's toast to you.

552
00:35:45,899 --> 00:35:47,209
I'm driving. No drinking.

553
00:35:47,589 --> 00:35:49,442
Find a designated driver, Qian Heng.

554
00:35:49,538 --> 00:35:52,122
We rarely meet each other. Come, let's have a drink.

555
00:35:52,222 --> 00:35:53,802
Nobody can match my driver's seat.

556
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:05,798
Why is nobody talking?

557
00:36:06,467 --> 00:36:09,548
Let's do this. We play some games to lighten the mood.

558
00:36:09,699 --> 00:36:10,962
- What do you think?   - Okay.

559
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,722
- All right, let's play.   - There are plenty of people now.

560
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:15,802
Let's play Truth or Dare. How about it?

561
00:36:15,951 --> 00:36:18,561
- Okay.   - Are you sure you want to play this?

562
00:36:18,899 --> 00:36:20,639
Didn't Lawyer Wu want us to be happy?

563
00:36:21,055 --> 00:36:22,060
Yu Fei said he wanted to play.

564
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:23,407
- I want to play too.   - Me too.

565
00:36:23,488 --> 00:36:25,249
That's three. Who else?

566
00:36:25,586 --> 00:36:27,642
Since we are all here enjoying ourselves together,

567
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,242
I'll join in to support you all.

568
00:36:29,323 --> 00:36:32,602
But, I think Truth or Dare is a bit outdated.

569
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
What about this?

570
00:36:34,098 --> 00:36:36,282
Let's play Truth or Dare with legal codes.

571
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,320
Okay.

572
00:36:42,905 --> 00:36:44,162
I'll start.

573
00:36:44,594 --> 00:36:46,322
Bottle bottom and bottle mouth

574
00:36:46,403 --> 00:36:47,682
represent one person, respectively.

575
00:36:48,091 --> 00:36:49,802
The one pointed to by the bottom of the bottle will ask

576
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,202
say, Article 1,067(2) of the Civil Code.

577
00:36:53,954 --> 00:36:55,755
The person facing the bottle mouth will answer.

578
00:36:55,859 --> 00:36:57,842
If they can't answer within three minutes,

579
00:36:57,923 --> 00:36:59,202
they have to pay a fine of 50 yuan.

580
00:36:59,399 --> 00:37:02,671
The 50 yuan goes to the common fund as the cost for the next gathering.

581
00:37:03,345 --> 00:37:04,976
But, isn't this bad?

582
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:08,002
So, are we gambling as a group?

583
00:37:08,414 --> 00:37:09,426
Gambling crime refers to participating in

584
00:37:09,523 --> 00:37:11,162
group gambling for the purpose of profit

585
00:37:11,242 --> 00:37:13,042
or engaging in activities related to gambling as a profession.

586
00:37:13,351 --> 00:37:15,202
Subjectively, the objective must be profit-oriented.

587
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,922
Are we doing this for profit?

588
00:37:18,443 --> 00:37:20,362
Is your criminal law taught by a PE teacher?

589
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,640
Let's start.

590
00:37:40,289 --> 00:37:43,790
Article 1,046 of the Civil Code.

591
00:37:48,547 --> 00:37:50,362
Marriage should be based on the complete voluntary consent of both parties.

592
00:37:50,443 --> 00:37:52,922
It is forbidden for either party to force the other.

593
00:37:57,739 --> 00:38:03,002
"It is forbidden for any organization or individual to interfere."

594
00:38:18,954 --> 00:38:21,842
Article 1,076 of the Civil Code.

595
00:38:44,939 --> 00:38:47,322
Article 1,078 of the Civil Code.

596
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:22,540
Article 1,343 of the Civil Code.

597
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,322
I suddenly have something urgent.

598
00:39:27,403 --> 00:39:29,259
You guys keep playing. I'm leaving first.

599
00:39:29,354 --> 00:39:31,383
- I have something too.   - I'm leaving first.

600
00:39:31,468 --> 00:39:32,522
I'm leaving first.

601
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:34,122
Goodbye! We're not going to see you off.

602
00:39:52,259 --> 00:39:55,418
January 1, 2021, the Civil Code officially comes into effect.

603
00:39:55,499 --> 00:39:56,978
Please recite Articles 1,136,

604
00:39:57,058 --> 00:40:01,162
1,137 and 1,142 of the Civil Code.

605
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,840
What?

606
00:40:04,978 --> 00:40:06,699
Why are you combining them?

607
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,210
Is this group buying?

608
00:40:11,018 --> 00:40:12,969
According to Article 1,136 of the Civil Code,

609
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,800
printed wills should have two or more present witnesses.

610
00:40:15,899 --> 00:40:18,779
The testator and witnesses should sign each page of the will

611
00:40:18,859 --> 00:40:20,442
noting the year, month, and day.

612
00:40:20,523 --> 00:40:21,844
Article 1,117.

613
00:40:21,939 --> 00:40:23,477
A testament made in the form of audio or video recording

614
00:40:23,562 --> 00:40:25,485
should be witnessed by two or more persons.

615
00:40:25,578 --> 00:40:27,930
The testator and the witnesses should record their names or portraits

616
00:40:28,011 --> 00:40:29,492
as well as the year, month, and day

617
00:40:29,573 --> 00:40:31,642
in the audio or video recording.

618
00:40:31,749 --> 00:40:33,226
Article 1,142.

619
00:40:33,338 --> 00:40:36,458
The testator may revoke or modify the testament he or she has made.

620
00:40:36,538 --> 00:40:39,119
After making the testament, the testator is deemed to have

621
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,480
revoked or modified it by performing any act contrary to its content.

622
00:40:42,578 --> 00:40:44,682
If there are multiple wills with conflicting contents

623
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,530
the last will shall prevail.

624
00:40:47,899 --> 00:40:48,962
Do you remember that?

625
00:40:49,137 --> 00:40:50,522
Yes, I remembered.

626
00:40:53,978 --> 00:40:57,322
Only Lawyer Qian can memorize the law so well.

627
00:40:57,971 --> 00:40:59,362
Let me give it a try.

628
00:40:59,538 --> 00:41:01,328
I should also learn from Lawyer Qian.

629
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,944
Why do you drink so much? This is 24%.

630
00:41:07,025 --> 00:41:08,415
It's even stronger than red wine.

631
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:11,058
Lawyer Qian. I think we're almost done today.

632
00:41:11,138 --> 00:41:12,529
Why don't I send Cheng Yao home first?

633
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,802
I'll drive and take her home.

634
00:41:14,993 --> 00:41:16,053
Put the money away.

635
00:41:16,699 --> 00:41:17,798
Slow down.

636
00:41:18,146 --> 00:41:19,242
Take care of your wallet.

637
00:41:23,498 --> 00:41:24,498
Be careful.

638
00:41:26,978 --> 00:41:28,079
Slow down.

639
00:41:28,308 --> 00:41:29,777
I put the wallet in your pocket.

640
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:32,056
Slow down.

641
00:41:42,115 --> 00:41:43,642
Did I hear it right just now?

642
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:46,142
Lawyer Qian is sending a girl home?

643
00:41:48,294 --> 00:41:50,482
(It's over. I thought she was quite simple.)

644
00:41:50,661 --> 00:41:52,602
(I just realized she's not simple.)

645
00:41:58,687 --> 00:42:00,848
(Enough. Don't think too much into it.)

646
00:42:00,963 --> 00:42:02,762
(Your toxic boss starts to take care of people.)

647
00:42:02,843 --> 00:42:04,202
(Isn't that a good thing?)

648
00:42:07,956 --> 00:42:09,093
(Yes, it is.)

649
00:42:09,174 --> 00:42:10,922
(The boss can't just favor me.)

650
00:42:10,994 --> 00:42:12,489
(It will cause everyone to be envious.)

651
00:42:15,317 --> 00:42:16,357
(Bao Rui.)

652
00:42:16,508 --> 00:42:18,768
(You still have to finish the evidence chain tomorrow.)

653
00:42:22,259 --> 00:42:23,362
Are you crazy?

654
00:42:23,552 --> 00:42:25,811
- Don't talk about work in a private group.   - Are you crazy?

655
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:27,722
We are all here. Why did you create a new group?

656
00:42:28,178 --> 00:42:29,999
Are you chatting or not? If not, I'll kick you out.

657
00:42:30,138 --> 00:42:31,259
Your behavior is not good.

658
00:42:31,339 --> 00:42:32,497
Four people with three groups.

659
00:42:32,578 --> 00:42:35,122
What if you sent the important files to the wrong group?

660
00:42:35,267 --> 00:42:37,842
No way. As long as the boss isn't in the group, it's fine.

661
00:42:37,987 --> 00:42:39,642
Okay, then I'm relieved.

662
00:42:41,618 --> 00:42:43,659
Why is there a 30 yuan? Who's trying to shirk responsibility?

663
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,458
Shouldn't this money be confiscated?

664
00:42:45,539 --> 00:42:46,762
Let me see.

665
00:42:54,299 --> 00:42:55,299
Wake up.

666
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,909
Have some hangover tea later.

667
00:43:01,699 --> 00:43:02,699
Boss.

668
00:43:02,859 --> 00:43:05,448
You can still remind me to drink the hangover tea.

669
00:43:05,699 --> 00:43:08,202
You're not completely unsympathetic.

670
00:43:11,569 --> 00:43:14,082
After you sober up, you can unclog the drain.

671
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:19,162
I was wrong.

672
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:24,241
I declare you have been poisoned to the five organs and six viscera.

673
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:25,882
You can't be saved now.

674
00:43:34,449 --> 00:43:35,842
What did you say?

675
00:43:39,377 --> 00:43:40,677
I'm not feeling well.

676
00:43:40,805 --> 00:43:42,042
Don't do this to me.

677
00:43:42,266 --> 00:43:43,815
As a legal professional,

678
00:43:43,987 --> 00:43:46,642
you have to present evidence for everything you say or do.
