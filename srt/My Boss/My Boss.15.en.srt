1
00:01:35,682 --> 00:01:38,802
(My Boss)

2
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:40,880
(Episode 15)

3
00:01:40,961 --> 00:01:44,722
(Boss. Why are you so good to me, a mere tool?)

4
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:53,673
You didn't tell me because you didn't trust me.

5
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,777
You think that, like your ex-supervising lawyer,

6
00:01:55,881 --> 00:01:58,240
I'd choose money over my subordinates' self-esteem, right?

7
00:01:58,366 --> 00:01:59,837
No, boss.

8
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:01,839
I really don't want to bother you.

9
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,351
Do you know how dangerous your actions are?

10
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:07,200
He's a man.

11
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,320
If he takes it a step further, can you handle it?

12
00:02:10,367 --> 00:02:11,979
If he snatches your phone and deletes the video,

13
00:02:12,003 --> 00:02:13,282
can you handle it?

14
00:02:13,511 --> 00:02:15,533
If he turns it around and takes indecent video to threaten you,

15
00:02:15,557 --> 00:02:16,857
can you handle it?

16
00:02:33,714 --> 00:02:34,882
Cheng Yao,

17
00:02:35,775 --> 00:02:37,322
you need to learn to trust me.

18
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,922
Don't make decisions on your own.

19
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:44,700
Anytime you encounter a situation like this,

20
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,580
I will protect you.

21
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,722
Really.

22
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:05,952
Fine.

23
00:03:06,247 --> 00:03:07,602
Go back and rest.

24
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,823
Tang Bing probably won't come looking for you again.

25
00:03:09,847 --> 00:03:11,202
If you're not comfortable,

26
00:03:11,361 --> 00:03:13,401
I'll go with you to the front desk to change rooms.

27
00:03:22,088 --> 00:03:24,039
Boss, I have a question to ask you.

28
00:03:24,225 --> 00:03:25,362
What is it?

29
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:27,762
Why are you so good to a mere tool?

30
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,401
Tool? What do you mean?

31
00:03:29,574 --> 00:03:30,762
It's me.

32
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,067
You hired me into Junheng & Co because I can cook and hypnotize, right?

33
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:38,881
After Chen Qing Mei's case,

34
00:03:38,961 --> 00:03:40,040
you became cold toward me

35
00:03:40,143 --> 00:03:41,823
because you thought I treat you as a tool.

36
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,550
Is this matter important to you?

37
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:50,467
Since you have so many expectations of me,

38
00:03:50,548 --> 00:03:52,610
I need to figure out my position.

39
00:03:52,746 --> 00:03:54,975
I'm afraid I'll have some stupid ideas in the future.

40
00:03:59,551 --> 00:04:00,851
Forget it.

41
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,980
That night,

42
00:04:07,336 --> 00:04:09,206
I promised to help you take down Deng Ming.

43
00:04:11,848 --> 00:04:14,556
Boss, are you trying to back out now?

44
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,481
If I really saw you as a tool,

45
00:04:17,677 --> 00:04:19,707
I didn't need to promise you anything.

46
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:26,000
I admit that I have underestimated and misunderstood you before.

47
00:04:26,118 --> 00:04:28,070
But now, you are Cheng Yao,

48
00:04:28,411 --> 00:04:30,121
and you are a very important...

49
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,522
A very important employee to me.

50
00:04:49,057 --> 00:04:52,562
So, never underestimate your importance to me.

51
00:04:53,081 --> 00:04:54,381
Understood?

52
00:04:56,681 --> 00:04:57,801
Understood.

53
00:04:57,882 --> 00:04:59,122
Good.

54
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,892
Also, watch Chinese art history tonight

55
00:05:03,025 --> 00:05:04,461
and report your thoughts to me tomorrow morning.

56
00:05:04,485 --> 00:05:07,922
- New case? - If you've seen something dirty, you should wash your eyes.

57
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,540
Go ahead.

58
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,251
(Ting Ting, the mystery is solved.)

59
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,082
(I'm not just a tool.)

60
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:08,442
(My boss said I am a very important employee to him.)

61
00:06:08,585 --> 00:06:11,122
(So, he must still care about me.)

62
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,951
(Maybe he sees me as a "protector" like Bao Rui.)

63
00:06:15,276 --> 00:06:17,243
(Maybe my status is a little lower than Bao's.)

64
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,802
(Like a "sect leader".)

65
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,041
(What do you mean?)

66
00:06:22,145 --> 00:06:23,762
(What did Qian Heng do to you again?)

67
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,649
Don't even think about it.

68
00:06:27,775 --> 00:06:29,242
You can't do anything.

69
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,241
If someone harasses you again, just slap him.

70
00:06:31,344 --> 00:06:33,656
His net worth, whether hundreds of millions or billions, doesn't matter.

71
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,349
- But what if I can't beat him? - Tell me, and I'll help you fight.

72
00:06:46,975 --> 00:06:49,602
(It's nothing. I just suddenly realized)

73
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:53,296
(that I should just stay by my boss's side and work hard)

74
00:06:53,421 --> 00:06:55,522
(to become a top 10 employee.)

75
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:57,162
(I'm going to study art history.)

76
00:07:07,441 --> 00:07:08,522
Why?

77
00:07:09,761 --> 00:07:11,061
I'm just asking.

78
00:07:11,576 --> 00:07:13,842
Do you only see me as a tool to make money?

79
00:07:14,816 --> 00:07:16,722
Who is this idiot trying to cause trouble here?

80
00:07:16,961 --> 00:07:18,456
How could I be so heartless toward you?

81
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,780
Am I that heartless?

82
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,282
Qian.

83
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,842
Qian.

84
00:07:29,242 --> 00:07:31,042
Are you hurt? Why aren't you talking?

85
00:07:31,123 --> 00:07:32,202
(Hello?)

86
00:07:33,655 --> 00:07:35,684
Will it hurt a lot?

87
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,280
You thought I'd use and discard you without caring?

88
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,842
I understand you must be hurt.

89
00:07:42,946 --> 00:07:44,986
(Tell me. How do you want me to make it up to you?)

90
00:07:51,321 --> 00:07:52,621
Then, you tell me.

91
00:07:52,961 --> 00:07:54,401
How do you want to make it up to me?

92
00:07:55,121 --> 00:07:56,430
Wait a minute.

93
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,761
Why do I feel like the question you're asking today is a bit strange?

94
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,390
Are you really hurt,

95
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,121
or are you trying to trick me?

96
00:08:04,201 --> 00:08:05,510
I am very hurt.

97
00:08:05,755 --> 00:08:07,256
So, how do you think

98
00:08:07,337 --> 00:08:09,367
you can make it up to this employee?

99
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,322
Let me use all my experience to tell you.

100
00:08:14,654 --> 00:08:16,603
With sincerity.

101
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,882
You can figure it out for yourself.

102
00:08:25,961 --> 00:08:29,510
With sincerity?

103
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,282
Cheng Xi.

104
00:08:33,401 --> 00:08:34,681
It's so late. Are you going out?

105
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,200
Yes, my client is in trouble. I'm going to check on him.

106
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:38,523
Then, let's go. I'll drive you.

107
00:08:38,631 --> 00:08:41,042
No need, I've hailed a cab. The cab has arrived.

108
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,907
- Then, bring the fruit with you. I bought you some... - Wu Jun.

109
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,496
You don't have to give me anything anymore. I won't accept it.

110
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,896
You don't have to be nice to me either.

111
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,002
It's not worth it.

112
00:08:50,728 --> 00:08:52,482
These fruits are all your favorites.

113
00:08:55,561 --> 00:08:58,562
When I give advice to Qian Heng, I'm confident and knowledgeable.

114
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,060
But, when it comes to myself,

115
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,150
I am nothing.

116
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,162
Boss, what do you want to eat? I'll go get it for you.

117
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,802
That's so much food.

118
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:26,682
I was going to help you take some.

119
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,360
I was bored, so I made a few more trips.

120
00:09:30,405 --> 00:09:32,442
- You eat them all. - All for me?

121
00:09:33,608 --> 00:09:35,718
Then, I won't be able to lose weight again.

122
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,780
You don't have to eat them.

123
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,682
But, I heard that their desserts are made by a five-star chef.

124
00:09:51,161 --> 00:09:52,201
Oh, boss.

125
00:09:52,281 --> 00:09:54,482
You know Sanda, right? Can you teach me some moves?

126
00:09:54,563 --> 00:09:56,882
What do you mean? Do you think I can't protect you?

127
00:09:57,678 --> 00:09:59,027
No.

128
00:09:59,385 --> 00:10:02,424
What I mean is, you can't protect me 24 hours.

129
00:10:02,528 --> 00:10:05,431
Bao said that, as a family lawyer,

130
00:10:05,512 --> 00:10:07,699
it's very likely to be retaliated by the other party.

131
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,882
So, I need to learn some self-defense.

132
00:10:11,951 --> 00:10:13,072
Then, you better not learn.

133
00:10:13,153 --> 00:10:16,229
With your physique, just earn more money and hire a bodyguard.

134
00:10:20,309 --> 00:10:22,741
But, you're so rich. Why do you have to learn it yourself?

135
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,150
I learned Sanda when I was young.

136
00:10:26,321 --> 00:10:28,417
Maybe because I was too outstanding when I was young.

137
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:31,362
Not only was I good at studying, but I was also skilled in various areas.

138
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:33,122
So, I was always bullied

139
00:10:34,016 --> 00:10:35,696
and forced to spend a lot of pocket money.

140
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,000
I didn't expect the competition in primary school to be so fierce.

141
00:10:40,377 --> 00:10:42,562
No wonder you have so many childhood traumas.

142
00:10:42,872 --> 00:10:45,453
Yeah, I couldn't handle my counterattack well at the start,

143
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:47,459
needing to compensate for some medical expenses.

144
00:10:47,485 --> 00:10:49,029
Later, I mastered the skills of

145
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,354
causing internal injuries without any bruises.

146
00:10:50,378 --> 00:10:51,676
I didn't need to compensate anymore.

147
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,380
Boss, so you were already at such a high level when you were a kid.

148
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,701
No wonder your friends didn't want to play with you.

149
00:10:57,801 --> 00:11:00,121
If you can't talk properly, then don't say anything, okay?

150
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,583
I'll eat more.

151
00:11:06,116 --> 00:11:08,922
(Let me use all my experience to tell you.)

152
00:11:09,224 --> 00:11:11,162
(With sincerity.)

153
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,642
(You can figure it out yourself.)

154
00:11:17,801 --> 00:11:18,841
Oh, right.

155
00:11:19,047 --> 00:11:20,883
Didn't we reserve five days for this?

156
00:11:20,977 --> 00:11:22,529
With the contract terminated, we have a few days free.

157
00:11:22,553 --> 00:11:25,433
Do you have any places you want to go or restaurants you want to eat at?

158
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,150
Currently, there's an AI conference happening here.

159
00:11:30,196 --> 00:11:31,492
It might be difficult to reschedule.

160
00:11:31,516 --> 00:11:34,280
Instead of leaving my schedule empty or wasting time at the airport,

161
00:11:34,479 --> 00:11:36,500
why not give it to my employee as a benefit?

162
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,042
The firm will pay the fees in full.

163
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,568
Wouldn't that be too much?

164
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:48,642
Cheng Yao, being with me is a rare opportunity for self-improvement.

165
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:50,736
And, to make up for the shock you received yesterday,

166
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,400
I can agree to one more request of yours.

167
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,121
Any request?

168
00:11:55,368 --> 00:11:58,002
- Yes. - Why do I feel a little scared?

169
00:11:59,258 --> 00:12:00,280
I'll count to three.

170
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:01,739
If you don't say it, it's invalid.

171
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,210
- One, two... - I want to go to an amusement park.

172
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:06,361
An amusement park?

173
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:08,657
I heard there's a new one built here. It's so much fun.

174
00:12:08,681 --> 00:12:11,562
They say the roller coaster is thrilling. I want to ride it.

175
00:12:11,953 --> 00:12:14,516
Such a childish place doesn't fit my style.

176
00:12:14,602 --> 00:12:16,914
And, spending a day in such a meaningless place

177
00:12:17,032 --> 00:12:18,472
is like throwing money into the sea.

178
00:12:18,586 --> 00:12:20,280
But, you just said

179
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:22,052
you would agree to any request I make.

180
00:12:22,094 --> 00:12:23,802
Did I say that? Any evidence?

181
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,598
- (Any request?) - (Yes.)

182
00:12:32,113 --> 00:12:33,602
(Why do I feel a little scared?)

183
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:36,039
(I'll count to three. If you don't say it, it's invalid.)

184
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,522
- (One, two...) - (I want to go to an amusement park.)

185
00:12:38,961 --> 00:12:40,990
This is legal recorded evidence.

186
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:44,799
Boss, you told me to learn how to protect my legal rights.

187
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,180
You can't go back on your word.

188
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,360
(It must be the progress of the employee that surprised me.)

189
00:12:57,615 --> 00:13:00,525
(Since she's working so hard, I can be flexible.)

190
00:13:02,168 --> 00:13:03,468
Boss, are you thirsty?

191
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,115
There's another cup here.

192
00:13:06,196 --> 00:13:08,040
No, thank you. You should eat quickly.

193
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:10,405
- Don't you want to go to the amusement park? - Okay.

194
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:18,820
As the boss of a law firm that would later win the Golden Scale Award,

195
00:13:19,235 --> 00:13:21,338
it's my responsibility to take care of female employees

196
00:13:21,362 --> 00:13:22,482
in times of trouble.

197
00:13:22,572 --> 00:13:24,322
But, only this time. It won't happen again.

198
00:13:27,161 --> 00:13:28,227
Boss.

199
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:30,536
I can't find the evidence I recorded of Tang Bing.

200
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,602
My phone wasn't dropped or exposed to water.

201
00:13:34,797 --> 00:13:36,601
Could it be that it was hacked?

202
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,922
I deleted it.

203
00:13:40,201 --> 00:13:44,071
Why did you delete it? What if Tang Bing causes trouble for us later?

204
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,980
I have a backup of the video.

205
00:13:47,766 --> 00:13:49,511
But I don't want you to have any bad memories.

206
00:13:49,535 --> 00:13:50,575
So I deleted it.

207
00:13:50,688 --> 00:13:51,800
But don't worry.

208
00:13:51,942 --> 00:13:54,502
I will never let someone like Tang Bing get away with it.

209
00:13:54,664 --> 00:13:57,174
I also won't let him have a chance to harm other women.

210
00:14:01,921 --> 00:14:03,221
(Cheng Yao.)

211
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,442
(Just indulge this time.)

212
00:14:05,664 --> 00:14:08,133
(Just think of it as a dream where you go on a date)

213
00:14:08,258 --> 00:14:11,081
(with someone you have a crush on in a completely unfamiliar city.)

214
00:14:11,438 --> 00:14:13,959
(After today, you will still be his subordinate.)

215
00:14:14,158 --> 00:14:15,438
(Just a regular employee.)

216
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:16,694
(He will still be your boss.)

217
00:14:16,718 --> 00:14:18,039
All right, let's eat quickly.

218
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,560
After we finish eating, we'll leave.

219
00:14:50,843 --> 00:14:51,880
I refuse.

220
00:14:52,001 --> 00:14:54,842
Using an air gun is too low-class. If you're interested in playing,

221
00:14:54,923 --> 00:14:56,339
next time I'll take you to the archery range.

222
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:57,913
Why?

223
00:14:58,601 --> 00:15:00,085
Their prize is a cute lemon mascot.

224
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,647
Look, I want that one.

225
00:15:01,728 --> 00:15:03,028
It's so adorable.

226
00:15:03,681 --> 00:15:05,071
What's so fun about a few lemons?

227
00:15:05,492 --> 00:15:07,219
If you like it, I'll get you as many fresh ones as you'd like.

228
00:15:07,243 --> 00:15:08,523
Boss.

229
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,802
This one is a limited edition. It's hard to find. Look!

230
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:14,323
Doesn't it look like it deserves a beating?

231
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,180
It does deserve it.

232
00:15:18,758 --> 00:15:21,137
If you don't want to play, I'll go play by myself.

233
00:16:04,627 --> 00:16:07,322
Honey, you're amazing. You hit all of them.

234
00:16:07,531 --> 00:16:09,882
- Not bad. Go pick one that you like. - Okay.

235
00:16:09,963 --> 00:16:11,802
- Here. - Pick one.

236
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,042
- Which one do you like? - I want this one, the big lemon.

237
00:16:15,162 --> 00:16:16,320
This one?

238
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,957
- Here you go. - This one is good.

239
00:16:17,997 --> 00:16:19,722
- Here, take this. - Thank you.

240
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,909
Honey, I want that too.

241
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:24,162
No problem. Leave it to me.

242
00:16:24,437 --> 00:16:25,599
Give me one too.

243
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,760
Okay.

244
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,841
If you want it, hurry up.

245
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:29,221
This is the last one.

246
00:16:30,161 --> 00:16:31,461
"Honey, I want it too."

247
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,053
You're so silly. Come on.

248
00:18:00,161 --> 00:18:01,601
Don't you like that big lemon?

249
00:18:01,719 --> 00:18:02,842
Let's go.

250
00:18:07,022 --> 00:18:08,139
Sir.

251
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,751
Here, this is the last one.

252
00:18:09,832 --> 00:18:12,752
- Thank you. - Congratulations, little girl. Your boyfriend is amazing.

253
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,410
He's not my boyfriend. He's my boss.

254
00:18:18,874 --> 00:18:20,082
Give it to me.

255
00:18:20,551 --> 00:18:22,222
But you don't like it.

256
00:18:22,773 --> 00:18:23,973
I won it myself, so it's mine.

257
00:18:25,015 --> 00:18:26,315
What else do you want to play?

258
00:18:26,743 --> 00:18:27,824
How about a roller coaster?

259
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,162
Let's go now. The line shouldn't be too long.

260
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,380
Waiting in line?

261
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,762
(The queue time is around 60 minutes.)

262
00:18:42,023 --> 00:18:45,623
Are you sure you want to wait in line for an hour just to play this thing?

263
00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:48,887
This roller coaster is not an ordinary one.

264
00:18:48,968 --> 00:18:51,240
It says online that when it reaches the highest point,

265
00:18:51,343 --> 00:18:52,544
you can make a wish.

266
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,040
Otherwise, there wouldn't be so many people waiting in line.

267
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,391
What is your wish?

268
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,911
To get rich and have money.

269
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,748
Then, you might as well make a wish with me.

270
00:19:02,772 --> 00:19:04,582
The chances of it coming true might be higher.

271
00:19:04,606 --> 00:19:07,966
You're wasting your time for an unreliable online marketing gimmick.

272
00:19:08,056 --> 00:19:09,356
Is your time not valuable?

273
00:19:09,859 --> 00:19:11,242
No.

274
00:19:11,406 --> 00:19:14,246
It's just that in life, there are many times when we waste time, right?

275
00:19:14,363 --> 00:19:17,348
Who can guarantee we're profiting every minute, every second?

276
00:19:17,686 --> 00:19:22,026
Besides, in life, there are many happy moments like this, doing nothing.

277
00:19:26,361 --> 00:19:27,661
Boss, what about you?

278
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,167
What is the most memorable moment for you?

279
00:19:32,361 --> 00:19:34,151
It's not when you made money, is it?

280
00:19:57,482 --> 00:19:58,974
Boss, if you don't want to wait in line,

281
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:00,478
you can go to a cafe and wait for me.

282
00:20:00,544 --> 00:20:01,602
I'll come find you later.

283
00:20:01,699 --> 00:20:03,282
No need. I'm already here.

284
00:20:03,448 --> 00:20:05,768
I've already invested in this, so I can't give up halfway.

285
00:20:05,869 --> 00:20:07,169
Let's just wait in line.

286
00:20:21,052 --> 00:20:22,362
Thank you.

287
00:20:24,953 --> 00:20:26,253
Thank you.

288
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,511
Why do I feel a little nervous?

289
00:20:30,998 --> 00:20:32,520
It's not your first time riding a roller coaster.

290
00:20:32,544 --> 00:20:33,842
Why are you so excited?

291
00:20:34,351 --> 00:20:37,122
But, it's been a long time since I've ridden a roller coaster.

292
00:20:40,681 --> 00:20:42,042
Have you thought of a wish?

293
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,500
Are you ready?

294
00:20:44,122 --> 00:20:45,242
I'm ready.

295
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:46,804
But I'm not telling you.

296
00:20:56,601 --> 00:20:58,790
(I want to keep following Lawyer Qian.)

297
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,522
Okay.

298
00:21:50,844 --> 00:21:53,004
Let's go to the next venue. Don't waste any more time.

299
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,200
You're not really going to throw up, are you?

300
00:22:06,121 --> 00:22:07,421
I swallowed it back.

301
00:22:07,881 --> 00:22:10,871
Boss, I think I pulled my neck.

302
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,840
Let me take you to a place to relax.

303
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:13,922
Let's go.

304
00:22:18,654 --> 00:22:20,164
It's so beautiful.

305
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,540
Are you feeling better now?

306
00:22:27,776 --> 00:22:30,778
I was too nervous to make a wish just now.

307
00:22:31,624 --> 00:22:32,924
Let's ride it again then.

308
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:36,522
No need. As long as I'm sincere it's enough.

309
00:22:36,641 --> 00:22:38,191
Is it important? What's your wish?

310
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,040
I've already told you. I want to be rich.

311
00:22:42,215 --> 00:22:44,362
Just some nonsense. Even making a wish is useless.

312
00:22:45,681 --> 00:22:47,070
There's a piano there too.

313
00:22:56,401 --> 00:23:00,871
(My wish is to work with Lawyer Qian forever.)

314
00:23:11,484 --> 00:23:14,000
If I give you a chance to travel,

315
00:23:14,081 --> 00:23:15,381
where would you like to go?

316
00:23:17,641 --> 00:23:19,231
I want to go

317
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,602
to a place close to nature.

318
00:23:22,227 --> 00:23:23,841
To see the sunrise, to see the stars.

319
00:23:23,921 --> 00:23:25,221
It must be very enjoyable.

320
00:23:26,547 --> 00:23:28,987
But, I'm already happy to be at the amusement park this time.

321
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,390
Thank you for accompanying me.

322
00:23:33,101 --> 00:23:34,280
I have an idea.

323
00:23:34,361 --> 00:23:35,871
There are mountains and water there.

324
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,799
The air is fresh, and it's very quiet.

325
00:23:38,118 --> 00:23:39,838
It's much more fun than the amusement park.

326
00:23:41,081 --> 00:23:43,056
- Have you been there before? - Of course, I have.

327
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,962
But when I went there, it was at night.

328
00:23:45,169 --> 00:23:46,518
The sky was full of stars.

329
00:23:46,961 --> 00:23:48,841
I borrowed a telescope from someone

330
00:23:48,921 --> 00:23:50,310
and could even see the Milky Way.

331
00:23:52,161 --> 00:23:54,595
It's been a long time since I last saw a sky full of stars.

332
00:23:59,441 --> 00:24:00,881
There's also a sea of flowers there.

333
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,300
The scenery is so open.

334
00:24:02,601 --> 00:24:03,920
When you walk in,

335
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,642
you feel like time slows down.

336
00:24:05,798 --> 00:24:07,308
The whole place smells of spring.

337
00:24:08,391 --> 00:24:09,831
I won't get bitten by snakes, right?

338
00:24:10,117 --> 00:24:12,107
- Are you afraid of snakes? - Is there anyone who isn't afraid of snakes?

339
00:24:12,131 --> 00:24:13,162
Me.

340
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,086
You are afraid of dogs.

341
00:24:17,111 --> 00:24:18,861
Not anymore.

342
00:24:19,063 --> 00:24:20,692
That's all thanks to me.

343
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,162
Let's go there for our retreat.

344
00:24:26,074 --> 00:24:27,182
Really?

345
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,602
That's great. Then, I'll work hard.

346
00:24:31,967 --> 00:24:34,556
Who knows, maybe I'll have a little romantic encounter.

347
00:24:41,168 --> 00:24:44,282
So you're constantly thinking about these dirty things, huh?

348
00:24:44,378 --> 00:24:46,202
No, I'm just fantasizing.

349
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,081
Okay, go write a 5,000-word self-reflection report when you get back.

350
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:50,322
Why?

351
00:24:50,415 --> 00:24:52,117
I'm single. Can't I fantasize?

352
00:24:52,198 --> 00:24:53,923
You're only my boss. Do you have the right to control me?

353
00:24:53,947 --> 00:24:56,362
Of course, I do. Because you're important to me.

354
00:25:24,929 --> 00:25:26,442
I need to go to the bathroom.

355
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,762
What did he mean just now?

356
00:25:51,126 --> 00:25:53,602
Does he mean that he's the boss and can control me?

357
00:25:54,881 --> 00:25:56,002
Or...

358
00:25:56,504 --> 00:25:57,842
(I'm important to him?)

359
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,080
(Why bother thinking about it?)

360
00:26:00,105 --> 00:26:02,050
(It's rare to have a chance to have fun with him.)

361
00:26:02,074 --> 00:26:03,211
(I should cherish it.)

362
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:04,602
(Stop overthinking.)

363
00:26:07,881 --> 00:26:09,391
It's just one day.

364
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:11,350
Just have a good dream and stick to it.

365
00:26:17,751 --> 00:26:20,122
(Of course, I do. Because you're important to me.)

366
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,082
(It must be my sense of duty as a boss to protect the employees.)

367
00:26:45,547 --> 00:26:46,922
Excuse me, sir.

368
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,282
Can I buy this lemon mascot from you?

369
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,229
This is the last one.

370
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,586
I want to buy it for my girlfriend.

371
00:26:53,742 --> 00:26:56,600
As long as you agree, any amount of money is fine.

372
00:26:56,703 --> 00:26:58,009
- No. - Come on, sir.

373
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,250
Look at how handsome you are.

374
00:26:59,344 --> 00:27:00,576
You must be a kind-hearted person.

375
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,282
- Are you still a student? - Yes.

376
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:04,310
Are you in college or high school?

377
00:27:05,361 --> 00:27:07,201
I'm repeating a year, still in my senior year.

378
00:27:07,296 --> 00:27:08,776
What was your score on the mock exam?

379
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,910
A little over 300, I didn't pass.

380
00:27:12,373 --> 00:27:14,733
With this score, you won't even be able to go to a college.

381
00:27:14,824 --> 00:27:16,424
And, you're still thinking about dating?

382
00:27:16,776 --> 00:27:18,676
What you need to buy now is not a lemon mascot

383
00:27:18,781 --> 00:27:21,139
but past years' college entrance exam questions and mock exam questions.

384
00:27:21,163 --> 00:27:22,562
But, I really like her.

385
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:24,079
Youth is so short.

386
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:26,700
If I don't seize it,

387
00:27:27,315 --> 00:27:28,722
I will definitely regret it.

388
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,430
Failing the college entrance exam

389
00:27:30,492 --> 00:27:33,119
with a high school education may lead to unemployment after graduation.

390
00:27:33,143 --> 00:27:34,833
You won't be able to afford a house, a car, or designer bags.

391
00:27:34,857 --> 00:27:37,217
You won't be able to go to fancy restaurants or buy things.

392
00:27:37,423 --> 00:27:40,448
Besides rolling its eyes at you, what else can this lemon mascot do?

393
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,600
Will she still be with you when the time comes?

394
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:46,362
Okay, sorry.

395
00:27:47,978 --> 00:27:49,202
Wait a minute.

396
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,776
This voucher is for a buffet dinner for two at the Intercontinental Hotel.

397
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,562
Take it and treat your girlfriend.

398
00:28:00,342 --> 00:28:01,482
Why?

399
00:28:01,655 --> 00:28:03,336
Of course, you have to treat your girlfriend well.

400
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,261
But, you also have to remember to study hard.

401
00:28:07,093 --> 00:28:09,682
Some things can be done together. Do you understand?

402
00:28:09,812 --> 00:28:11,841
Thank you, sir. I will definitely study hard.

403
00:28:11,999 --> 00:28:14,761
But, can't you give me this lemon mascot?

404
00:28:14,968 --> 00:28:16,687
Why can't you understand what I'm saying?

405
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,322
You obviously don't understand girls.

406
00:28:18,499 --> 00:28:20,928
She is already in high school. How could she like such childish things?

407
00:28:20,952 --> 00:28:22,456
Even elementary school students don't like it.

408
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,975
I'll dispose of it later.

409
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,159
Okay, then. Thanks for this.

410
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,540
Go.

411
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,122
Is it too childish?

412
00:29:00,694 --> 00:29:01,799
Sorry, boss.

413
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,722
- There were many people in the bathroom. I was in a queue. - Okay.

414
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,940
What were you doing just now?

415
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,920
It's too dusty outside.

416
00:29:10,093 --> 00:29:11,333
Come with me to the mall later.

417
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,682
Let's find a gift box for it.

418
00:29:13,525 --> 00:29:14,909
- I'll help you carry it. - No need.

419
00:29:14,933 --> 00:29:17,093
Your hands are wet. You'll get the lemon mascot dirty.

420
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,362
(Didn't you say it's childish?)

421
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,231
Have some coffee, boss.

422
00:29:40,385 --> 00:29:42,175
Did you have fun today?

423
00:29:43,103 --> 00:29:45,924
Being able to hang out with you for a day is like a dream come true.

424
00:29:46,846 --> 00:29:47,847
Do you need a massage?

425
00:29:47,928 --> 00:29:48,962
No, thanks.

426
00:29:49,601 --> 00:29:51,121
What about the self-reflection report?

427
00:29:52,961 --> 00:29:54,261
Really?

428
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,122
(As expected, the cost of dreaming is very cruel.)

429
00:30:03,961 --> 00:30:05,282
Do you want to watch me write it?

430
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,279
The computer is over there. 5,000 words.

431
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,840
Not a single word should be missing.

432
00:32:16,015 --> 00:32:19,922
(First of all, I shouldn't be so unambitious and full of dirty thoughts.)

433
00:32:20,085 --> 00:32:23,262
(Second, I shouldn't force my boss to play air guns with me.)

434
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,239
(It seriously affects his image.)

435
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:29,160
(Third, I shouldn't pressure my boss to eat unhealthy snacks.)

436
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,045
(It harms his health.)

437
00:32:31,163 --> 00:32:33,754
(Fourth, my boss's time is worth a fortune.)

438
00:32:33,835 --> 00:32:36,142
(I shouldn't ask him to accompany me to the aquarium today.)

439
00:32:36,166 --> 00:32:40,442
(It wastes his precious time and life on such meaningless things.)

440
00:33:35,545 --> 00:33:38,448
(It's just that in life, there are many times when we waste time, right?)

441
00:33:38,472 --> 00:33:41,268
(Who can guarantee we're profiting every minute, every second?)

442
00:33:44,496 --> 00:33:48,482
(Besides, there are many happy moments like this, doing nothing.)

443
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,260
(He fell asleep?)

444
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,162
(As expected, my boss is the cutest when he's asleep.)

445
00:35:14,489 --> 00:35:15,999
(No messing around, no sharp tongue.)

446
00:35:16,088 --> 00:35:18,248
(And no forcing me to write a self-reflection report.)

447
00:35:20,815 --> 00:35:22,245
What a coincidence, boss.

448
00:35:23,959 --> 00:35:26,722
- You're awake. - What are you doing? You scared me.

449
00:35:28,401 --> 00:35:29,701
We should head to the airport.

450
00:35:30,479 --> 00:35:31,788
I'll help you pack your luggage.

451
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:44,383
Bai Xing Meng's case.

452
00:35:44,464 --> 00:35:45,764
We won it.

453
00:35:46,721 --> 00:35:47,882
Really?

454
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,791
Justice may be delayed, but it will never be absent.

455
00:35:54,931 --> 00:35:56,402
Boss, I think you're so handsome.

456
00:35:56,505 --> 00:35:58,255
You're the messenger of justice.

457
00:35:58,673 --> 00:35:59,678
Enough, stop it.

458
00:35:59,759 --> 00:36:02,480
Although your flattery is true, it's a bit cheesy.

459
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,310
Your last comment was also cheesy.

460
00:36:05,961 --> 00:36:07,922
At least when it comes from my mouth,

461
00:36:08,136 --> 00:36:09,436
it has more substance.

462
00:36:10,481 --> 00:36:13,400
How about I make you a seafood feast

463
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,562
when we land and go back to the rental house?

464
00:36:15,721 --> 00:36:17,390
After all, I'm also good at cooking.

465
00:36:18,328 --> 00:36:20,437
Then, I want scallops.

466
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,220
It's a deal.

467
00:36:35,032 --> 00:36:36,943
Is this box sturdy?

468
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,641
Don't break it.

469
00:36:41,759 --> 00:36:43,229
What's going on with you?

470
00:36:44,084 --> 00:36:46,724
A case worth billions of yuan, and you're just quitting like that?

471
00:36:47,044 --> 00:36:48,804
Nothing, I just don't want to do it anymore.

472
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:49,959
Be careful.

473
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,536
If you don't have else, go home quickly.

474
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,802
What is this?

475
00:36:52,934 --> 00:36:55,094
- It looks sinister and cunning. - The lemon mascot.

476
00:36:57,819 --> 00:36:59,125
Cheng Yao, tell me the truth.

477
00:36:59,281 --> 00:37:00,802
What happened during these two days?

478
00:37:00,924 --> 00:37:03,322
Why did he abandon this multi-billion case?

479
00:37:03,644 --> 00:37:06,440
- That Tang... - Cheng Yao is just an assistant lawyer.

480
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,440
It was my decision to withdraw from the case.

481
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,911
Do you know that the client has already complained to the Law Association?

482
00:37:11,935 --> 00:37:13,710
The Law Association? That serious?

483
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:16,097
I remember someone saying that Trust Law is my weakness,

484
00:37:16,146 --> 00:37:18,005
and I need help to improve. Right?

485
00:37:20,209 --> 00:37:23,779
Qian, if you have any problems with me, you can tell me directly.

486
00:37:23,888 --> 00:37:26,002
There's no need for this. Really unnecessary.

487
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:29,281
- Lawyer Wu... - Tang Bing was not a good person to begin with.

488
00:37:29,446 --> 00:37:30,766
This is the reason I don't do it.

489
00:37:31,281 --> 00:37:32,393
What's wrong with you?

490
00:37:32,474 --> 00:37:34,714
You never used to say that someone is not a good person.

491
00:37:34,761 --> 00:37:36,881
What happened to you? Can you tell me?

492
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,042
Cheng Yao.

493
00:37:38,961 --> 00:37:41,104
Did your boss hit his head on a door, or get hit by a car,

494
00:37:41,128 --> 00:37:42,642
or get cursed by someone?

495
00:37:43,232 --> 00:37:46,362
As his assistant, I feel the need to remind you to keep an eye on him.

496
00:37:46,521 --> 00:37:47,565
That's enough.

497
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,320
The amount for this case is not that big.

498
00:37:49,462 --> 00:37:51,002
I will reimburse you. Hurry back.

499
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,362
Only I can tolerate your bad temper.

500
00:37:57,361 --> 00:37:58,921
I'll handle the Law Association myself.

501
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,682
You always cause me trouble.

502
00:38:05,406 --> 00:38:07,988
Boss, I'm sorry. I caused trouble for you again.

503
00:38:09,574 --> 00:38:11,696
Did you buy the ingredients for tonight's celebration?

504
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,196
Hurry and buy them, or they won't be fresh.

505
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:16,482
(I caused so much trouble, and now I need him to clean up the mess.)

506
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,540
(What right do I have to celebrate?)

507
00:38:18,856 --> 00:38:21,617
(Cheng Yao, you should think about how to make up for your mistakes.)

508
00:38:26,505 --> 00:38:28,761
(Yao Yao, are you back from your business trip today?)

509
00:38:28,841 --> 00:38:30,047
(I'll treat you to dinner tonight.)

510
00:38:30,071 --> 00:38:32,322
(Hao Zi and I bought a house. You have to come.)

511
00:38:37,412 --> 00:38:39,651
Boss, I'm sorry. My classmate invited me to dinner.

512
00:38:39,732 --> 00:38:41,480
I can't cook for you anymore.

513
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:42,962
Classmate? Gu Bei Qing?

514
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,362
My former roommate.

515
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,002
Okay.

516
00:38:47,326 --> 00:38:49,082
But after Tang Bing's incident,

517
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:51,332
you can't let your guard down even if they're your roommates.

518
00:38:51,356 --> 00:38:53,236
Especially when it comes to drinking, you know?

519
00:38:54,329 --> 00:38:56,760
Boss, if you really need me to make up for

520
00:38:56,851 --> 00:38:58,651
the losses of the law firm with another case,

521
00:38:58,791 --> 00:39:00,122
I'm willing to do it.

522
00:39:00,758 --> 00:39:03,242
I'll do my best, and see you at work.

523
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:19,239
Hello, welcome to Pizza Hut.

524
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,362
Yao Yao,

525
00:39:21,116 --> 00:39:22,559
why so late?

526
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,750
It's hard to ask you out now.

527
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:27,208
What's going on?

528
00:39:27,321 --> 00:39:29,427
With the special protection of Lawyer Qian,

529
00:39:29,508 --> 00:39:30,656
you're neglecting your friends.

530
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,122
Don't even mention it.

531
00:39:32,415 --> 00:39:34,482
I messed up the case again on this business trip.

532
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,760
Even with Qian Heng, you could still mess up a case?

533
00:39:46,441 --> 00:39:47,802
Wishing you a pleasant meal.

534
00:39:48,889 --> 00:39:51,522
Anyway, the 1 billion deal was gone.

535
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,989
Lawyer Wu even came to question him at the airport.

536
00:39:57,247 --> 00:39:59,482
But, all I heard was,

537
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:02,120
"hero angers for the sake of a woman."

538
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,162
Don't tease me.

539
00:40:04,441 --> 00:40:07,517
I joined Junheng & Co to be a lawyer, not to fall in love.

540
00:40:08,357 --> 00:40:11,191
They all comforted me, saying I didn't use connections,

541
00:40:11,391 --> 00:40:14,496
but if it weren't for my sister, I wouldn't be their only choice.

542
00:40:14,721 --> 00:40:16,040
I luckily got into Junheng,

543
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,602
but ended up messing up two cases in a short period of time.

544
00:40:18,961 --> 00:40:21,283
Do you think I dare to have any thoughts about my boss?

545
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,465
If I do so, am I even a person?

546
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:23,847
It's not that serious.

547
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,162
You're so smart and lovely.

548
00:40:27,395 --> 00:40:28,626
After spending so much time together,

549
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:30,089
he'd surely develop some feelings for you.

550
00:40:30,113 --> 00:40:31,442
Unless he's a robot.

551
00:40:31,736 --> 00:40:34,445
Anyway, I can't keep fantasizing about my boss anymore.

552
00:40:34,958 --> 00:40:37,242
I have to sort out my emotions and work hard.

553
00:40:38,562 --> 00:40:39,999
Okay.

554
00:40:40,113 --> 00:40:42,042
You're a workaholic. You're the best.

555
00:40:42,129 --> 00:40:43,879
I can't argue with you.

556
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,820
Hurry up and eat.

557
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,950
Let me show you the new house I bought.

558
00:40:52,711 --> 00:40:53,842
What do you think?

559
00:40:55,043 --> 00:40:57,722
Three bedrooms, two living rooms, one bathroom. It's so big.

560
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,922
But how come you

561
00:41:02,518 --> 00:41:05,362
never told me about buying a house before? It's an important matter.

562
00:41:06,863 --> 00:41:11,282
You are so busy working that I can't even ask you out.

563
00:41:13,902 --> 00:41:17,400
It's because Hao Zi and I think the baby is about to be born,

564
00:41:17,649 --> 00:41:19,535
so we can't keep renting.

565
00:41:21,326 --> 00:41:22,840
But, you two aren't even married yet.

566
00:41:22,931 --> 00:41:24,282
Who does the house belong to?

567
00:41:24,403 --> 00:41:25,723
Don't worry.

568
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,520
Hao Zi was afraid I would overthink,

569
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,120
so we registered the marriage in advance.

570
00:41:30,422 --> 00:41:32,046
You got married?

571
00:41:32,722 --> 00:41:34,720
- You're married. - Hey, keep your voice down.

572
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,680
Sit down. Look at you.

573
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:38,079
Are you that surprised?

574
00:41:38,223 --> 00:41:40,162
Isn't this a natural thing?

575
00:41:43,021 --> 00:41:44,842
For the wedding,

576
00:41:44,948 --> 00:41:47,402
we might have to wait until after I give birth.

577
00:41:47,888 --> 00:41:50,207
Although I knew you two would get married sooner or later,

578
00:41:50,231 --> 00:41:52,382
I didn't expect this day to come so soon.

579
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,780
I'm happy for you.

580
00:41:57,176 --> 00:42:01,042
In fact, I also feel that my life has entered a new stage

581
00:42:01,264 --> 00:42:03,642
since registering my marriage.

582
00:42:03,918 --> 00:42:08,122
And, I have also found what I should be doing.

583
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:11,522
Choosing this place today is also for a good start.

584
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,191
I hope that in every stage of our future,

585
00:42:14,272 --> 00:42:16,242
we can achieve victory.

586
00:42:16,394 --> 00:42:17,402
Definitely.

587
00:42:17,945 --> 00:42:19,245
All the way to victory.

588
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,922
- Senior. - Qian Heng.

589
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,600
Thank you so much.

590
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,980
You saved Yao Yao.

591
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,161
She didn't tell me the details,

592
00:42:41,385 --> 00:42:43,520
but I can guess what happened.

593
00:42:43,706 --> 00:42:44,962
Thank you so much.

594
00:42:45,294 --> 00:42:47,282
Senior, Cheng Yao is my employee.

595
00:42:47,378 --> 00:42:49,027
For both professional and personal reasons, I should protect her.

596
00:42:49,051 --> 00:42:50,351
Don't need to thank me.

597
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,029
No, this is not a small matter.

598
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,030
She's still so young.

599
00:42:55,752 --> 00:42:58,461
I can't even imagine such a thing.

600
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,160
She's my only sister.

601
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,870
You saved her, and it's like you saved our entire family.

602
00:43:03,354 --> 00:43:06,002
- Thanks. - Senior, you really don't have to be polite to me.

603
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,751
I just did what I should've done.

604
00:43:08,321 --> 00:43:09,910
Please sit down first.

605
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,511
I really don't know how to thank you.

606
00:43:16,712 --> 00:43:19,192
If there's anything in the future that you need my help with,

607
00:43:19,281 --> 00:43:20,790
I will definitely not refuse.
