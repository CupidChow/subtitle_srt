1
00:01:35,621 --> 00:01:38,802
(My Boss)

2
00:01:39,744 --> 00:01:41,603
(Episode 11)

3
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:44,002
(Apart from helping Qian Heng treat his insomnia, )

4
00:01:44,132 --> 00:01:45,802
(I'm indeed useless.)

5
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:13,890
(Qian Heng)

6
00:02:17,198 --> 00:02:19,188
(Boss, this is...)

7
00:02:21,727 --> 00:02:23,322
(Today's dinner money.)

8
00:02:24,542 --> 00:02:26,362
(I told you it's my treat.)

9
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:29,129
(I'm a man of principles.)

10
00:02:29,238 --> 00:02:31,162
(I'm not used to having women treat me.)

11
00:02:31,243 --> 00:02:32,523
(I don't want to owe any favors)

12
00:02:32,693 --> 00:02:34,660
(so people can use it as an excuse)

13
00:02:34,756 --> 00:02:36,162
(to approach me frequently.)

14
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:42,164
(But we are living under the same roof.)

15
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,242
(Do I still need excuses like these?)

16
00:02:46,184 --> 00:02:47,722
(You can choose not to accept it.)

17
00:02:50,662 --> 00:02:51,962
(Thank you, boss.)

18
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:30,061
Hello, Miss. We are running a promotion for this ice cream.

19
00:03:30,096 --> 00:03:31,339
Half price for the second item. Do you...

20
00:03:31,363 --> 00:03:33,242
- I'm good, thank you. - Sure.

21
00:03:33,582 --> 00:03:36,260
(I hate "half price for second item" promotions.)

22
00:03:36,346 --> 00:03:38,962
(It's so depressing for single people.)

23
00:03:39,662 --> 00:03:40,962
(However...)

24
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,544
Since he did so many things for me,

25
00:03:47,662 --> 00:03:49,402
why don't I buy him an ice cream?

26
00:03:51,997 --> 00:03:54,002
The total is 53.8 yuan.

27
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:57,002
I want to get another ice cream.

28
00:03:57,067 --> 00:03:58,362
Sorry.

29
00:04:02,421 --> 00:04:03,990
(It's to show my gratitude.)

30
00:04:04,084 --> 00:04:05,203
(A polite gesture.)

31
00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:26,842
I'll eat it later.

32
00:04:38,269 --> 00:04:39,842
Boss, you are home?

33
00:04:40,544 --> 00:04:41,958
I bought you an ice cream.

34
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:44,602
- I got it at half price. - It's fine. I don't eat ice cream.

35
00:04:45,122 --> 00:04:47,794
Have some ice cream to increase your blood sugar.

36
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,505
It helps with sleeping.

37
00:04:50,951 --> 00:04:52,501
(Did she buy it especially for me?)

38
00:04:52,582 --> 00:04:53,882
(She even opened it for me.)

39
00:05:08,783 --> 00:05:11,042
Boss, didn't you say you don't eat ice cream?

40
00:05:12,467 --> 00:05:15,322
Since you opened it for me, I'll take a bite reluctantly.

41
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:18,379
It tastes nice.

42
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,242
You can put some more in the fridge.

43
00:05:20,725 --> 00:05:22,025
You can claim it from me.

44
00:05:27,381 --> 00:05:29,642
I'm going to walk the dog.

45
00:05:50,621 --> 00:05:52,421
(Enough, Cheng Yao.)

46
00:05:52,622 --> 00:05:54,601
(Why is your brain full of perverted thoughts?)

47
00:05:59,982 --> 00:06:01,142
What are you doing?

48
00:06:01,222 --> 00:06:02,654
What is this?

49
00:06:02,771 --> 00:06:05,162
Whose dog is this? How rude!

50
00:06:05,527 --> 00:06:07,389
- Sorry! - You'll be fine.

51
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,682
- Sorry. - You'll be fine.

52
00:06:09,821 --> 00:06:12,412
Is she all right? I can compensate.

53
00:06:13,301 --> 00:06:15,042
There's no use apologizing.

54
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:18,181
She is my daughter whom I've raised for five years.

55
00:06:18,355 --> 00:06:21,421
My baby has been ruined by your dog.

56
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:24,211
- Tell me how you are going to settle this. - Ruined?

57
00:06:24,991 --> 00:06:26,724
Do you need to get her checked at the hospital?

58
00:06:26,748 --> 00:06:28,898
What's the use of getting her checked at the hospital?

59
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:30,232
Just compensate her medical fee.

60
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,762
Fixed price.

61
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,181
- 20,000 yuan. - 20,000 yuan?

62
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:35,922
Mister, is this a scam?

63
00:06:36,053 --> 00:06:38,002
How did I become the scammer?

64
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:41,061
Your dog bullied my dog.

65
00:06:41,155 --> 00:06:42,777
Look how small my dog is.

66
00:06:42,858 --> 00:06:44,261
Her heart is so fragile.

67
00:06:44,342 --> 00:06:46,277
I don't think asking for 20,000 yuan is too much!

68
00:06:46,301 --> 00:06:47,601
Mister.

69
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,211
I pay her salary.

70
00:06:51,022 --> 00:06:53,651
If you are asking for money, come to me.

71
00:06:54,388 --> 00:06:55,858
That works too.

72
00:06:56,836 --> 00:07:01,017
Do you admit what your dog just did?

73
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:05,099
A dog needs to be educated when they do something wrong.

74
00:07:05,256 --> 00:07:07,372
However, education requires law.

75
00:07:07,662 --> 00:07:10,612
Are we talking about the law now? Fine, let's talk about the law.

76
00:07:11,077 --> 00:07:14,194
According to law, this is rape.

77
00:07:14,327 --> 00:07:15,622
It's punishable by death.

78
00:07:15,795 --> 00:07:17,262
Wait. Why are you so unreasonable?

79
00:07:17,373 --> 00:07:19,753
I apologized and said I could compensate.

80
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:21,304
Enough. Stop talking.

81
00:07:21,662 --> 00:07:23,451
We should compensate when we must.

82
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,670
I like your alacrity.

83
00:07:25,751 --> 00:07:28,602
- All right. You can scan my QR code. - Boss, stop.

84
00:07:31,462 --> 00:07:32,762
Here.

85
00:07:35,501 --> 00:07:38,262
- It's all your fault. - Your account has received 3,000 yuan.

86
00:07:38,373 --> 00:07:39,673
Mister.

87
00:07:39,905 --> 00:07:42,459
We agreed on 20,000 yuan but you paid 3,000 yuan.

88
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,962
Your Mathematics is...

89
00:07:44,186 --> 00:07:46,538
- Well, I have a question. - Go ahead.

90
00:07:46,662 --> 00:07:49,242
You said my dog sexually harassed your dog.

91
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,281
But my dog did nothing.

92
00:07:52,211 --> 00:07:53,834
What do you mean?

93
00:07:53,915 --> 00:07:55,221
I was watching from the side.

94
00:07:55,301 --> 00:07:57,402
Do you have evidence? Did you take any videos?

95
00:07:57,524 --> 00:08:00,082
Are you saying you have other eyewitnesses

96
00:08:00,163 --> 00:08:02,123
apart from you, the party who lacks impartiality?

97
00:08:03,342 --> 00:08:04,891
Eye...

98
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:07,781
Eyewitnesses?

99
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,378
You tried to frame my dog without any evidence.

100
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:11,617
Do you know about defamation?

101
00:08:11,641 --> 00:08:13,383
Article 246 Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law

102
00:08:13,407 --> 00:08:15,164
of the People's Republic of China states that

103
00:08:15,188 --> 00:08:17,550
whoever insults another person in public through violence or other means

104
00:08:17,574 --> 00:08:19,054
or fabricates facts to slander shall,

105
00:08:19,118 --> 00:08:21,680
if serious, be sentenced to imprisonment of not more than three years,

106
00:08:21,704 --> 00:08:23,864
criminal detention or deprivation of political rights.

107
00:08:23,915 --> 00:08:25,702
I'm telling you. Don't try to scare me.

108
00:08:25,891 --> 00:08:27,781
I will bring my dog

109
00:08:27,861 --> 00:08:29,547
to a hospital to do a DNA test.

110
00:08:29,633 --> 00:08:31,821
If your dog's DNA is found,

111
00:08:31,901 --> 00:08:33,282
it will be serious.

112
00:08:33,391 --> 00:08:35,782
Sure. Do whatever you like to your dog

113
00:08:35,977 --> 00:08:40,252
but you need my consent to get my dog's fur to do the DNA test.

114
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:42,227
Unfortunately, I don't agree with it.

115
00:08:42,308 --> 00:08:44,766
However, I have recorded

116
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:47,092
your act of blackmailing me just now.

117
00:08:48,597 --> 00:08:50,098
(Just compensate her medical fee.)

118
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,181
(Fixed price. 20,000 yuan.)

119
00:08:52,376 --> 00:08:53,617
(20,000 yuan?)

120
00:08:53,714 --> 00:08:55,543
(Mister, is this a scam?)

121
00:08:56,658 --> 00:08:57,958
Are you trying to run away?

122
00:08:58,636 --> 00:09:01,181
Your name, phone number, and transaction record are all here.

123
00:09:01,355 --> 00:09:03,122
The 3,000 yuan I transferred to you

124
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:05,322
is enough to start a case.

125
00:09:06,811 --> 00:09:09,282
Well, what do you want?

126
00:09:12,822 --> 00:09:14,122
Be a man of alacrity.

127
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,402
(Scan it and pay me)

128
00:09:17,942 --> 00:09:20,842
Your account has received 3,000 yuan.

129
00:09:26,295 --> 00:09:27,442
Boss,

130
00:09:27,576 --> 00:09:29,726
you chased him away with a few words.

131
00:09:34,861 --> 00:09:36,781
Why are you looking at me like that?

132
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,682
Boss, you are amazing.

133
00:09:39,422 --> 00:09:41,162
I'm afraid of meeting someone like him.

134
00:09:41,273 --> 00:09:42,623
I can't win even if I'm right.

135
00:09:43,357 --> 00:09:44,657
It's nothing much.

136
00:09:47,261 --> 00:09:48,762
Boss, why did you come down?

137
00:09:48,896 --> 00:09:50,367
Did you finish your ice cream?

138
00:09:53,381 --> 00:09:54,681
You forgot to throw the rubbish.

139
00:09:57,261 --> 00:09:58,891
I forgot to throw the rubbish?

140
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:02,522
I threw it when I came down.

141
00:10:05,302 --> 00:10:06,792
(What? Did you say)

142
00:10:06,878 --> 00:10:08,997
(Qian Heng not only spoke about music, games, and dreams with you)

143
00:10:09,021 --> 00:10:11,362
(but he even purposely went downstairs to save you?)

144
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,959
He said he went downstairs to throw the rubbish.

145
00:10:14,942 --> 00:10:18,131
Something's not right. This is very fishy.

146
00:10:18,582 --> 00:10:19,882
Why?

147
00:10:21,261 --> 00:10:23,421
Is he going to fire me again?

148
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:25,762
Was that why he pitied me?

149
00:10:26,784 --> 00:10:28,742
Gosh. You are an idiot when it comes to love.

150
00:10:28,822 --> 00:10:30,322
I'm sure Qian Heng likes you.

151
00:10:30,433 --> 00:10:32,852
Impossible. Stop saying nonsense.

152
00:10:33,812 --> 00:10:35,773
If you don't believe me, test him.

153
00:10:35,925 --> 00:10:37,891
I think you quite enjoy it.

154
00:10:38,182 --> 00:10:39,572
I'm not talking to you anymore!

155
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,842
Do you have any snacks you like?

156
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,942
Wasabi lotus roots, crab roe fish cakes,

157
00:10:45,023 --> 00:10:47,162
peach-flavored ginseng water, and black garlic.

158
00:10:47,249 --> 00:10:48,762
They are very delicious.

159
00:10:49,198 --> 00:10:51,118
What a coincidence. Get some of everything then.

160
00:10:51,163 --> 00:10:53,282
- All of them? - I like them too.

161
00:10:57,598 --> 00:10:58,882
Let me carry them.

162
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,549
No. I don't want you to spoil my snacks.

163
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:03,701
So pretty.

164
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,051
What do you mean?

165
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,242
Enough. I said you are pretty.

166
00:11:08,231 --> 00:11:09,391
If you really like it,

167
00:11:09,472 --> 00:11:11,522
I have a few rare records in my villa.

168
00:11:11,627 --> 00:11:12,682
I can bring them for you.

169
00:11:12,777 --> 00:11:14,383
I don't even have a good gramophone.

170
00:11:14,463 --> 00:11:16,131
It's a waste to give them to me.

171
00:11:16,419 --> 00:11:18,762
It's not a waste if you like them.

172
00:11:21,741 --> 00:11:25,282
What a surprise. You are quite cute sometimes, boss.

173
00:11:43,331 --> 00:11:44,640
He likes me.

174
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:54,522
Come in.

175
00:12:03,847 --> 00:12:04,927
My dear boss.

176
00:12:05,105 --> 00:12:06,981
To thank you for your help today,

177
00:12:07,062 --> 00:12:10,262
I've decided to treat you sincerely.

178
00:12:10,488 --> 00:12:12,681
I've prepared a special surprise for you.

179
00:12:14,023 --> 00:12:15,533
Are you trying to get a raise?

180
00:12:16,532 --> 00:12:18,682
Am I someone who only cares about salary?

181
00:12:19,342 --> 00:12:23,303
Boss, I really want to thank you for Wei Zhen Tian's incident today.

182
00:12:23,485 --> 00:12:25,802
Please give me a chance to repay the favor.

183
00:12:26,331 --> 00:12:28,082
You know my time is precious.

184
00:12:28,163 --> 00:12:31,181
Of course, I know that. The surprise is ready.

185
00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:33,572
You just need to stand up and head over there.

186
00:12:35,978 --> 00:12:37,162
This way, please.

187
00:12:42,605 --> 00:12:43,802
Boss.

188
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,402
I see that you have been very busy recently.

189
00:12:46,483 --> 00:12:49,682
I'm worried that you might be heaty so I prepared a foot bath for you.

190
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,527
I'm sure you will fall in love with it once you try it.

191
00:12:54,102 --> 00:12:56,201
The water is hot. How can it help cool me down?

192
00:12:56,334 --> 00:12:58,134
How will you know if you don't give it a try?

193
00:13:00,634 --> 00:13:02,762
This foot bath is new. No one has used it before.

194
00:13:09,102 --> 00:13:11,581
Boss, you can soak in the foot bath while having some fruits.

195
00:13:11,715 --> 00:13:13,015
There's orange juice too.

196
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:14,929
Cake as well.

197
00:13:21,861 --> 00:13:23,161
How's the water temperature?

198
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:25,002
It's not bad.

199
00:13:26,021 --> 00:13:27,622
I prepared this especially for you.

200
00:13:27,702 --> 00:13:29,208
There's a herbal bag inside.

201
00:13:29,285 --> 00:13:30,631
There's forsythia and honeysuckle in it.

202
00:13:30,655 --> 00:13:32,295
It helps with cooling and detoxification.

203
00:13:35,952 --> 00:13:37,252
Wait for me.

204
00:13:42,982 --> 00:13:45,612
What do you think? Isn't the atmosphere nice?

205
00:13:45,969 --> 00:13:47,269
It feels redundant.

206
00:13:47,628 --> 00:13:50,018
No way. It looks nice.

207
00:13:53,028 --> 00:13:55,082
Actually, the balcony is good enough.

208
00:13:55,741 --> 00:13:57,642
There's no need for bells and whistles.

209
00:13:58,342 --> 00:14:00,502
I rented this place when I started my business

210
00:14:00,582 --> 00:14:01,882
because I liked this balcony.

211
00:14:03,062 --> 00:14:04,902
Boss, do you like balconies?

212
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,724
Are there people who don't like balconies?

213
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:08,322
I like balconies too

214
00:14:08,419 --> 00:14:10,248
but it's too hot in the day.

215
00:14:13,318 --> 00:14:14,679
I have a villa.

216
00:14:14,806 --> 00:14:16,088
It has a balcony

217
00:14:16,195 --> 00:14:17,495
and also a swimming pool.

218
00:14:18,334 --> 00:14:21,095
The sun feels the most comfortable about 4pm or 5pm in the afternoon.

219
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,499
When I'm taking a break, I will sit on the balcony

220
00:14:24,523 --> 00:14:25,823
while drinking coffee.

221
00:14:25,942 --> 00:14:27,022
I'll watch the river

222
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,440
and the mountain.

223
00:14:28,861 --> 00:14:31,572
It's a rare moment where I can feel completely relaxed.

224
00:14:35,613 --> 00:14:38,573
Boss, you are always busy at work.

225
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,900
I'm sure you are very stressed.

226
00:14:39,932 --> 00:14:42,003
That is why you must relax often.

227
00:14:42,723 --> 00:14:44,038
There are many ways to relax yourself.

228
00:14:44,062 --> 00:14:45,252
For example, taking a foot bath.

229
00:14:45,276 --> 00:14:47,802
It helps give you a good sleep as well.

230
00:14:48,501 --> 00:14:49,801
It's too troublesome.

231
00:14:50,219 --> 00:14:52,362
I need to fetch the water and pour away the water.

232
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:55,492
I can help you as long as you pay me more.

233
00:14:55,683 --> 00:14:56,842
Dream on.

234
00:16:31,678 --> 00:16:33,362
- Good morning. - Good morning.

235
00:16:33,942 --> 00:16:35,242
Good morning, Bao.

236
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:37,801
Good morning, Cheng Yao.

237
00:16:38,621 --> 00:16:39,958
You look like you are in good spirits.

238
00:16:39,982 --> 00:16:41,122
Last night, did you...

239
00:16:41,203 --> 00:16:42,322
Yes.

240
00:16:42,582 --> 00:16:45,011
- The foot bath was useful. - Just a foot bath?

241
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:46,642
What else?

242
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,002
I thought you would also apply a face mask.

243
00:16:50,112 --> 00:16:53,312
- Hello. - Hello. Does Qian Heng work here?

244
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:55,882
- Yes. - I have an important matter to find him.

245
00:16:56,095 --> 00:16:57,535
Can you help me make an appointment?

246
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,500
Sure. Please wait for a moment.

247
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,554
She is dressing mysteriously.

248
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,121
Is she some kind of female celebrity?

249
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:05,732
What female celebrity?

250
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,930
She is pregnant and is looking for Qian Heng.

251
00:17:08,017 --> 00:17:10,802
This is bad. The boss is having a secret relationship.

252
00:17:11,702 --> 00:17:14,382
What should we do? This has a huge negative impact on Junheng & Co.

253
00:17:14,487 --> 00:17:16,042
We might be involved in a court case.

254
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:18,713
The boss is involved so he can't accept the case.

255
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,162
Who in Junheng & Co can accept this case?

256
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:23,801
I'm the only one who can.

257
00:17:25,101 --> 00:17:27,082
Junheng & Co's future is in my hands.

258
00:17:27,345 --> 00:17:28,539
Let me show you how I can overturn this.

259
00:17:28,563 --> 00:17:30,042
Bao, stop talking nonsense.

260
00:17:30,141 --> 00:17:32,220
You are doomed if the boss hears you.

261
00:17:32,376 --> 00:17:34,176
He has no time to have a secret relationship.

262
00:17:34,228 --> 00:17:36,562
- How do you know? You can't read his mind. - Because...

263
00:17:39,261 --> 00:17:40,561
I'll show you how it's done.

264
00:17:44,352 --> 00:17:45,553
Hello.

265
00:17:45,702 --> 00:17:47,002
I am Qian Heng's lawyer.

266
00:17:47,637 --> 00:17:49,157
If you need anything,

267
00:17:49,323 --> 00:17:50,623
you can find me.

268
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,011
I want to hire Qian Heng to become my lawyer.

269
00:17:57,536 --> 00:17:58,802
I've misunderstood.

270
00:17:58,973 --> 00:18:01,003
I got excited for nothing.

271
00:18:02,188 --> 00:18:04,817
I heard that you are my lawyer.

272
00:18:06,462 --> 00:18:07,602
Boss.

273
00:18:08,017 --> 00:18:09,673
I am a lawyer working under you.

274
00:18:09,754 --> 00:18:11,314
There's nothing wrong with that, right?

275
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:12,582
Are you still excited?

276
00:18:12,701 --> 00:18:13,922
Not anymore.

277
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:16,851
Go to the meeting room with Cheng Yao later.

278
00:18:17,021 --> 00:18:18,242
This way, please.

279
00:18:24,902 --> 00:18:27,282
I don't feel excited anymore but I think I'm doomed.

280
00:18:38,693 --> 00:18:41,003
Lawyer Cheng, we meet again.

281
00:18:45,061 --> 00:18:46,642
Mr. Dong's girlfriend.

282
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:52,202
Lawyer Qian, I am Chen Qing Mei.

283
00:18:52,484 --> 00:18:54,353
My fiancé is Dong Shan.

284
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,082
He passed away in an accident.

285
00:18:56,205 --> 00:18:58,767
I want you to represent me

286
00:18:58,852 --> 00:19:01,492
and fight for the inheritance I deserve for the sake of my child.

287
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,640
I'm afraid you can't prove the relationship

288
00:19:05,782 --> 00:19:07,702
between the child in your stomach and Dong Shan.

289
00:19:08,622 --> 00:19:09,922
Yes.

290
00:19:10,301 --> 00:19:13,941
But no one told me that something happened to Dong Shan.

291
00:19:14,021 --> 00:19:16,790
When I found out about it, the memorial service was already over.

292
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:18,062
I didn't know what to do

293
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,302
so I went to Jiang Wen Xiu to ask for an explanation.

294
00:19:20,438 --> 00:19:22,802
She didn't care that I was pregnant

295
00:19:22,892 --> 00:19:24,941
and asked the security guard to chase me away.

296
00:19:25,021 --> 00:19:26,741
She called me a fraud

297
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,466
and a lewd woman.

298
00:19:28,899 --> 00:19:31,180
Lawyer Qian, she did it on purpose.

299
00:19:31,352 --> 00:19:33,837
I'm sure she knows that I'm pregnant with a boy

300
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:36,641
and she can't win against me because she only has a daughter.

301
00:19:36,741 --> 00:19:38,622
That was why she purposely stopped me

302
00:19:38,702 --> 00:19:40,342
from meeting Dong Shan for one last time

303
00:19:40,422 --> 00:19:41,981
and quickly cremated his body

304
00:19:42,102 --> 00:19:44,330
to destroy Dong Shan's DNA sample

305
00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:46,362
and not let my child acknowledge his father.

306
00:19:46,454 --> 00:19:47,902
Legally speaking, however,

307
00:19:47,982 --> 00:19:49,542
Madam Jiang is Mr. Dong's spouse.

308
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:52,640
She has the right to decide when to cremate Mr. Dong's body.

309
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:56,782
But... But there are no feelings between Mr. Dong and her.

310
00:19:56,938 --> 00:19:58,261
Both of them are career-minded.

311
00:19:58,376 --> 00:20:00,622
They were always busy and separated most of the time.

312
00:20:00,702 --> 00:20:03,212
Lawyer Qian, isn't it similar to them living separately?

313
00:20:04,061 --> 00:20:06,021
Besides, Dong Shan lived like a zombie

314
00:20:06,234 --> 00:20:08,224
whenever he was with her.

315
00:20:08,422 --> 00:20:11,291
If he knew I couldn't pay my respects to him after his death,

316
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,628
he would never forgive Jiang Wen Xiu.

317
00:20:13,743 --> 00:20:16,091
Mr. Dong felt guilty about Madam Jiang.

318
00:20:16,252 --> 00:20:17,881
I don't think he hated her.

319
00:20:25,948 --> 00:20:27,258
Lawyer Qian.

320
00:20:28,422 --> 00:20:29,602
Sorry.

321
00:20:30,781 --> 00:20:33,501
Did Dong Shan leave a written will?

322
00:20:33,596 --> 00:20:35,756
Chat histories, voice recordings, and videos work too.

323
00:20:36,821 --> 00:20:37,862
Well...

324
00:20:37,942 --> 00:20:40,242
It happened too suddenly.

325
00:20:40,345 --> 00:20:42,402
He never wrote a will.

326
00:20:42,483 --> 00:20:45,124
Otherwise, I'm sure he would leave the money to our son.

327
00:20:45,222 --> 00:20:47,661
Lawyer Qian. I beg you to help me.

328
00:20:47,803 --> 00:20:49,644
You are the only one who can help me.

329
00:20:49,727 --> 00:20:53,402
Dong Shan said you could do anything that other lawyers couldn't.

330
00:20:53,483 --> 00:20:56,163
- But Lawyer Qian... - How much inheritance are we talking about?

331
00:20:56,694 --> 00:20:58,362
About two hundred million yuan.

332
00:21:04,918 --> 00:21:07,258
Bao Rui, prepare the contract.

333
00:21:07,339 --> 00:21:08,639
No problem.

334
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,122
Cheng Yao,

335
00:21:10,548 --> 00:21:12,188
help Bao Rui in following up on the case.

336
00:21:27,525 --> 00:21:29,327
Boss, can you not accept this case?

337
00:21:29,408 --> 00:21:31,790
Who asked you to speak just now? What were you trying to do?

338
00:21:31,814 --> 00:21:33,838
I'm afraid that accepting this case will harm your reputation.

339
00:21:33,862 --> 00:21:34,962
Cheng Yao.

340
00:21:35,823 --> 00:21:38,663
I hope you can have a professional attitude when you are facing a case.

341
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,329
I have my own considerations while taking a case.

342
00:21:40,353 --> 00:21:41,862
Did you overstep your boundaries?

343
00:21:41,978 --> 00:21:44,538
Dong Shan also worked together with Jiang Wen Xiu in his career.

344
00:21:44,739 --> 00:21:47,039
Who is Chen Qing Mei to split his inheritance money?

345
00:21:47,463 --> 00:21:50,282
I never accept a case based on my client's identity.

346
00:21:50,502 --> 00:21:51,874
Chen Qing Mei is a mistress indeed

347
00:21:51,955 --> 00:21:54,358
but the child in her stomach should have the right to inherit

348
00:21:54,382 --> 00:21:56,228
as an individual.

349
00:21:56,461 --> 00:21:57,970
One should not be stripped of his legal right

350
00:21:57,994 --> 00:21:59,540
because of his tainted reputation at birth.

351
00:21:59,564 --> 00:22:01,858
But the money is Mr. Dong and his wife's shared asset.

352
00:22:01,939 --> 00:22:03,642
Why should Chen Qing Mei's son get the money?

353
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:05,622
Yes. The child is innocent

354
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:08,181
but what about Dong Min? Dong Min is also Dong Shan's child.

355
00:22:08,261 --> 00:22:09,800
Shouldn't her rights be protected?

356
00:22:09,881 --> 00:22:11,401
Cheng Yao, you are too emotional.

357
00:22:11,494 --> 00:22:12,622
I suggest you calm down.

358
00:22:12,702 --> 00:22:15,978
As a lawyer, you should remember that a baby's inheritance

359
00:22:16,111 --> 00:22:17,806
should remain in a partition of a succession

360
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,842
regardless of whether the child is born in or out of wedlock.

361
00:22:19,866 --> 00:22:21,002
Get out!

362
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:34,366
Sorry, boss.

363
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:35,821
I overstepped my boundaries.

364
00:22:35,902 --> 00:22:37,462
I won't be following this case anymore.

365
00:22:43,581 --> 00:22:44,881
Are you serious?

366
00:22:46,821 --> 00:22:48,172
You disappoint me.

367
00:22:49,907 --> 00:22:51,347
Doing this makes me think

368
00:22:51,428 --> 00:22:53,057
you are treating the law as a joke.

369
00:22:54,101 --> 00:22:56,799
Your foundation is not as good as the new staff from the same batch.

370
00:22:56,823 --> 00:22:58,623
You are supposed to work harder than them.

371
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:01,782
You should treat every case professionally and be unbiased.

372
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,900
That is how you can have a stable foothold in Junheng and the legal world.

373
00:23:07,341 --> 00:23:09,242
I really regret it.

374
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,582
I shouldn't have agreed for you to join this firm

375
00:23:11,662 --> 00:23:13,802
but Wu Jun insisted on putting you here.

376
00:23:19,422 --> 00:23:20,722
What do you mean?

377
00:23:22,142 --> 00:23:24,562
Did I not get hired through the normal process?

378
00:24:00,116 --> 00:24:03,346
(Qian Heng never sees me as someone important since the beginning.)

379
00:24:03,581 --> 00:24:05,442
(Apart from helping him treat his insomnia, )

380
00:24:05,681 --> 00:24:07,072
(I'm indeed useless.)

381
00:24:18,422 --> 00:24:19,722
Were you scolded?

382
00:24:20,581 --> 00:24:21,701
It's fine.

383
00:24:21,911 --> 00:24:23,667
He has a sharp tongue but he is soft-hearted.

384
00:24:23,691 --> 00:24:24,882
Drink this water

385
00:24:25,011 --> 00:24:26,480
and forget about everything he said.

386
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:28,682
It's all right.

387
00:24:29,114 --> 00:24:31,457
A life that hasn't experienced crying from being scolded by Qian Heng

388
00:24:31,481 --> 00:24:33,110
is not a perfect life in Junheng & Co.

389
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:34,413
Congratulations, Cheng Yao.

390
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,520
You have become a part of Junheng & Co now.

391
00:24:37,611 --> 00:24:39,332
Who handled Liu Jing Wen's divorce case?

392
00:24:39,413 --> 00:24:40,682
Come in!

393
00:24:46,131 --> 00:24:47,372
I'll go.

394
00:24:47,614 --> 00:24:49,005
I arranged the case.

395
00:24:49,086 --> 00:24:51,002
You only helped me amend a few things.

396
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,557
That means I didn't amend it well.

397
00:24:52,581 --> 00:24:53,701
I should go myself.

398
00:24:53,781 --> 00:24:54,882
I'll go.

399
00:24:55,749 --> 00:24:56,830
Yu Fei.

400
00:24:56,942 --> 00:24:58,242
He is furious right now.

401
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,002
You will be facing his wrath.

402
00:25:00,544 --> 00:25:02,044
Anyone who goes inside will have to face his wrath.

403
00:25:02,068 --> 00:25:03,368
I'll just keep quiet.

404
00:25:06,101 --> 00:25:07,401
You are cool.

405
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:10,682
Be careful.

406
00:25:19,713 --> 00:25:21,042
Did you do this?

407
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,020
Is this what you did?

408
00:25:23,247 --> 00:25:26,122
What is this? How can I explain this to the client?

409
00:25:26,434 --> 00:25:27,754
Who do you think Liu Jing Wen is?

410
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:29,371
Bao, can you help me apply for a leave?

411
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:31,002
I don't feel well.

412
00:25:31,142 --> 00:25:32,442
Sure.

413
00:25:33,193 --> 00:25:34,402
Go on.

414
00:25:38,222 --> 00:25:39,402
Are you going to tell him?

415
00:25:39,657 --> 00:25:41,328
Do you want me to tell him instead?

416
00:26:53,355 --> 00:26:55,986
Haven't I told you that a lawyer must be cautious?

417
00:26:56,341 --> 00:26:58,902
You are the most serious and cautious lawyer among them.

418
00:26:59,044 --> 00:27:01,002
I didn't expect you to make this mistake.

419
00:27:01,422 --> 00:27:02,732
Sorry, boss.

420
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:07,841
If this happens again, you will be terminated.

421
00:27:08,571 --> 00:27:10,122
(First-level crisis response.)

422
00:27:10,272 --> 00:27:13,252
(Lawyer Qian actually spent half an hour of his salary scolding someone.)

423
00:27:13,709 --> 00:27:14,958
(Thankfully, it was Yu Fei who went in.)

424
00:27:14,982 --> 00:27:16,542
(The girl wouldn't be able to take it.)

425
00:27:16,582 --> 00:27:18,802
(I wonder how Cheng Yao is doing right now.)

426
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:20,762
(I'm sure she is feeling very bad.)

427
00:27:21,061 --> 00:27:23,862
(Yu Fei has sacrificed to protect our youngest member.)

428
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:26,722
(As her seniors, we should not stand by and watch.)

429
00:27:30,203 --> 00:27:31,503
Go. Leave.

430
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:34,994
He's done.

431
00:27:40,623 --> 00:27:41,922
I'm fine.

432
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,482
(Cheng Yao, don't be sad.)

433
00:28:02,702 --> 00:28:04,282
(Bao will protect you in the future.)

434
00:28:07,321 --> 00:28:09,632
(I thought this group had been abandoned.)

435
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,962
(Bao Rui thought you got together with the boss)

436
00:28:14,062 --> 00:28:15,562
(so he created a new group.)

437
00:28:21,589 --> 00:28:24,041
(Yu Fei, why are you telling the truth to her?)

438
00:28:26,153 --> 00:28:27,682
(What do you mean?)

439
00:28:27,987 --> 00:28:30,029
(I joined this company through the back door.)

440
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:39,347
(In my opinion, if the boss thinks you are incapable, )

441
00:28:39,464 --> 00:28:41,584
(he won't let you stay regardless of how you joined.)

442
00:28:42,995 --> 00:28:44,382
(Cheng Yao, to be honest, )

443
00:28:44,462 --> 00:28:47,492
(I thought you had some unrealistic fantasies in the past.)

444
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,101
(After getting along with you, )

445
00:28:49,354 --> 00:28:50,675
(I think you are not bad.)

446
00:28:50,756 --> 00:28:53,387
(Stay strong and don't admit defeat.)

447
00:30:21,579 --> 00:30:22,879
(When are you coming back?)

448
00:30:33,322 --> 00:30:34,842
(I haven't eaten supper yet.)

449
00:30:54,341 --> 00:30:55,641
(I haven't eaten supper yet.)

450
00:31:03,581 --> 00:31:05,282
(Cheng Yao, wake up.)

451
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,682
(There's no way that he likes you.)

452
00:31:08,376 --> 00:31:11,242
(To him, you are just a tool used for hypnosis)

453
00:31:11,449 --> 00:31:13,400
(who got in through the back door.)

454
00:31:35,515 --> 00:31:37,675
What did you say to the client before the court trial?

455
00:31:38,052 --> 00:31:39,802
How can you fail to do such a simple thing?

456
00:31:41,061 --> 00:31:42,102
I'm telling you.

457
00:31:42,338 --> 00:31:44,202
Ask the client and discuss it with him again.

458
00:31:44,725 --> 00:31:46,845
You must consider every possible situation this time.

459
00:31:47,081 --> 00:31:48,381
Do you hear me?

460
00:31:52,182 --> 00:31:53,482
Get out!

461
00:31:57,862 --> 00:31:59,162
Good morning.

462
00:32:01,781 --> 00:32:03,442
What's wrong?

463
00:32:03,573 --> 00:32:05,614
Why are you so angry early in the morning?

464
00:32:05,814 --> 00:32:07,142
Yu Fei usually does his work well

465
00:32:07,222 --> 00:32:08,529
and he is meticulous.

466
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:11,071
Do you need to scold him so badly for two days over something so small?

467
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,935
It's exactly because he is usually meticulous.

468
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:15,345
That is why he shouldn't be making these simple mistakes.

469
00:32:15,493 --> 00:32:17,844
If I don't tell him now, he will get himself in trouble in the future!

470
00:32:17,868 --> 00:32:20,021
It's not an irreparable mistake.

471
00:32:20,194 --> 00:32:22,476
That's enough. Shouldn't you care about

472
00:32:22,595 --> 00:32:24,265
your staff's mental health?

473
00:32:28,965 --> 00:32:30,122
Wu.

474
00:32:30,677 --> 00:32:32,467
Ask where Cheng Yao is.

475
00:32:32,662 --> 00:32:34,382
She's in the office. Where can she be?

476
00:32:34,499 --> 00:32:35,799
She took the day off.

477
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:39,190
- Perhaps she has an emergency back home. - We had an argument yesterday.

478
00:32:39,862 --> 00:32:41,282
What happened?

479
00:32:41,353 --> 00:32:43,902
Forget about that. Help me ask where she is now.

480
00:32:43,982 --> 00:32:46,282
She won't reply to my texts and won't answer my call now.

481
00:32:47,182 --> 00:32:48,282
Yesterday?

482
00:32:52,315 --> 00:32:55,282
Did you tell her that she joined through the back door?

483
00:32:55,697 --> 00:32:58,571
Wu, why didn't you tell her something so important?

484
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:02,237
How could I tell her something so important?

485
00:33:02,261 --> 00:33:05,011
Do you think a girl like her doesn't want her pride?

486
00:33:06,821 --> 00:33:09,261
I was wondering why Cheng Xi has been acting cold towards me.

487
00:33:09,422 --> 00:33:11,345
You are always causing me trouble.

488
00:33:11,444 --> 00:33:12,702
This is a mess you caused.

489
00:33:12,821 --> 00:33:14,121
Deal with it yourself.

490
00:33:21,046 --> 00:33:23,487
(The phone you are calling has been switched off.)

491
00:33:23,621 --> 00:33:25,026
Cheng Yao turned off her phone.

492
00:33:26,325 --> 00:33:27,642
I'll call Cheng Xi right now.

493
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:29,072
Call her here.

494
00:33:29,685 --> 00:33:30,985
You finally remembered?

495
00:33:31,403 --> 00:33:33,073
Are you begging me after causing trouble?

496
00:33:55,276 --> 00:33:57,042
Wu Jun, what's wrong?

497
00:33:58,815 --> 00:34:01,282
Cheng Yao didn't go to work? What happened to her?

498
00:34:02,382 --> 00:34:03,902
It's nothing. Don't worry.

499
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,080
Well...

500
00:34:05,408 --> 00:34:09,092
Cheng Yao found out about the reason why she joined Junheng & Co.

501
00:34:15,028 --> 00:34:16,962
It's all right. I'll go look for her right now.

502
00:34:17,452 --> 00:34:19,122
Yes. Persuade her.

503
00:34:20,462 --> 00:34:22,532
Qian Heng told her about it.

504
00:34:24,485 --> 00:34:27,355
But I'm also responsible for this.

505
00:34:27,661 --> 00:34:30,692
I didn't manage it well and caused someone to spill the secret.

506
00:34:30,911 --> 00:34:32,540
(It's fine. Go and do your work.)

507
00:34:32,621 --> 00:34:34,451
I'll find her and have a chat with her.

508
00:34:34,532 --> 00:34:37,002
Sure. I'm sorry, Cheng Xi.

509
00:34:39,701 --> 00:34:41,001
What did she say?

510
00:34:43,742 --> 00:34:44,862
What?

511
00:34:45,004 --> 00:34:46,564
Cheng Xi is going to talk to Cheng Yao.

512
00:34:48,267 --> 00:34:50,328
You only know how to cause me trouble.

513
00:35:13,221 --> 00:35:14,991
- Cheng Xi. - You must be hungry.

514
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,572
I brought you some fish soup.

515
00:35:27,785 --> 00:35:29,242
Have some soup.

516
00:35:29,621 --> 00:35:30,642
Cheng Xi.

517
00:35:32,484 --> 00:35:35,194
Did Lawyer Wu hire me at Junheng & Co because he likes you?

518
00:35:35,365 --> 00:35:36,954
Did you already know that?

519
00:35:42,501 --> 00:35:43,642
Yes.

520
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:45,722
I know.

521
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,333
But your resume qualifies.

522
00:35:47,502 --> 00:35:49,042
Wu Jun has his own considerations.

523
00:35:49,222 --> 00:35:51,012
He is not a biased person.

524
00:35:53,782 --> 00:35:55,891
I still went through the back door.

525
00:35:56,516 --> 00:35:59,497
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I feel so embarrassed.

526
00:36:02,782 --> 00:36:04,132
Yao Yao.

527
00:36:05,277 --> 00:36:07,227
Silly girl.

528
00:36:08,494 --> 00:36:09,620
First of all,

529
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:12,521
you received an official offer letter, right?

530
00:36:12,657 --> 00:36:15,322
That means you joined the firm fair and square.

531
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:18,060
For the partners of the firm,

532
00:36:18,141 --> 00:36:20,021
you are the same as other lawyers.

533
00:36:20,127 --> 00:36:22,891
You need to prove everything through your work.

534
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:26,122
That is why you shouldn't be holed up in your room.

535
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:27,841
You should go to work immediately.

536
00:36:29,243 --> 00:36:31,114
But I don't want to go back.

537
00:36:32,046 --> 00:36:33,864
Qing Heng insists on taking Chen Qing Mei's case.

538
00:36:33,888 --> 00:36:36,608
I don't want to accept it. It goes against my objective as a lawyer.

539
00:36:39,678 --> 00:36:41,242
Are you not accepting this case

540
00:36:42,209 --> 00:36:43,682
because of me?

541
00:36:44,862 --> 00:36:47,291
No. I don't like it.

542
00:36:52,541 --> 00:36:54,291
I know you hate Deng Ming.

543
00:36:55,661 --> 00:36:58,451
You hate the woman who broke up my family.

544
00:36:59,581 --> 00:37:00,881
To be honest,

545
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:02,919
I hate her too.

546
00:37:03,902 --> 00:37:05,202
Until now,

547
00:37:05,491 --> 00:37:07,080
I still haven't gotten over it yet.

548
00:37:10,709 --> 00:37:12,442
However, I like

549
00:37:12,699 --> 00:37:14,290
my life right now.

550
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,920
I am a pro bono lawyer.

551
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:21,002
I think my life right now is calm and free.

552
00:37:22,385 --> 00:37:24,442
We can't be living in hatred.

553
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:26,811
It will mess up our lives.

554
00:37:29,942 --> 00:37:32,182
Instead of hating Deng Ming,

555
00:37:32,391 --> 00:37:34,221
I should work harder

556
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:37,042
so I can defeat him in court one day.

557
00:37:38,382 --> 00:37:41,002
That is why you should cherish this opportunity more.

558
00:37:43,342 --> 00:37:46,172
But I don't know if I want to accept this case or not.

559
00:37:50,462 --> 00:37:52,971
With my understanding of Qian Heng,

560
00:37:53,557 --> 00:37:55,602
I think he is a very excellent

561
00:37:55,786 --> 00:37:57,362
and capable lawyer.

562
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:00,002
If you want a long-lasting career,

563
00:38:00,282 --> 00:38:01,582
you should trust him.

564
00:38:04,754 --> 00:38:06,962
The more I want it, the more I mustn't admit defeat.

565
00:38:07,595 --> 00:38:09,696
I haven't been terminated yet at least.

566
00:38:09,916 --> 00:38:12,851
As long as I'm still in Junheng & Co, I should work hard to prove myself

567
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:16,140
and get rid of my title as someone who joined through the back door.

568
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,151
That's my good sister.

569
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:22,512
Do you want to eat something?

570
00:38:23,422 --> 00:38:24,522
Let's go.

571
00:38:29,342 --> 00:38:30,581
Here. Have some soup.

572
00:38:30,661 --> 00:38:32,518
The dishes don't look delicious at all.

573
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:33,998
Have some soup.

574
00:38:34,527 --> 00:38:35,722
Here.

575
00:38:44,485 --> 00:38:46,755
I found her. Thank you.

576
00:38:49,942 --> 00:38:51,061
Cheng Xi.

577
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:54,602
I didn't come here because of Lawyer Wu and the others.

578
00:38:54,902 --> 00:38:56,732
I just want to be alone.

579
00:38:57,635 --> 00:38:59,207
(Wu Jun)

580
00:39:04,462 --> 00:39:06,453
I'll ignore him and accompany you then.

581
00:39:09,352 --> 00:39:10,652
I'm drinking it.

582
00:39:27,013 --> 00:39:28,734
Stop walking around. You make my head hurt.

583
00:39:28,815 --> 00:39:31,242
Is there even a brain in there? How can it hurt?

584
00:39:31,382 --> 00:39:32,902
Cheng Xi ignored my calls

585
00:39:32,997 --> 00:39:34,877
after she found out about Cheng Yao's incident.

586
00:39:35,771 --> 00:39:38,401
Couldn't you beat around the bush a little?

587
00:39:38,862 --> 00:39:41,822
Didn't you promise to give Cheng Yao a chance?

588
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,122
Great.

589
00:39:43,259 --> 00:39:45,170
Are you breaking your promise now?

590
00:39:45,397 --> 00:39:47,717
Qian, I'm telling you. If this matter can't be dealt with,

591
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,242
- we won't be friends anymore. - Fine by me.

592
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:52,841
How dare you throw a tantrum.

593
00:39:55,382 --> 00:39:57,822
- Think of something. - What? How can I think of something?

594
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:00,619
One has her phone off and the other ignores my calls.

595
00:40:00,643 --> 00:40:02,322
Do you want me to fly to their place?

596
00:40:07,342 --> 00:40:08,692
Fly to their place?

597
00:40:12,958 --> 00:40:16,122
- Qian, stand up. - What are you doing?

598
00:40:16,238 --> 00:40:18,750
Didn't you ask me to think of an idea? I got it. Stand up.

599
00:40:21,181 --> 00:40:22,481
Let's go. Come with me.

600
00:40:22,854 --> 00:40:24,482
Go and apologize to Cheng Yao with me.

601
00:40:24,567 --> 00:40:26,261
Go and apologize to Cheng Yao with me right now.

602
00:40:26,285 --> 00:40:27,585
Let's go.

603
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,099
Good morning, Lawyer Qian. Good morning, Lawyer Wu.

604
00:40:33,854 --> 00:40:36,363
Cheng Yao, how are you?

605
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:38,702
I'm fine.

606
00:40:38,782 --> 00:40:40,322
Well, Qian...

607
00:40:40,403 --> 00:40:41,962
I think Lawyer Qian was right.

608
00:40:42,043 --> 00:40:43,592
I was too emotional.

609
00:40:43,893 --> 00:40:46,602
As a rookie lawyer, I shouldn't be picky about cases.

610
00:40:46,862 --> 00:40:49,320
I will do my best and work seriously in the future.

611
00:40:49,986 --> 00:40:53,575
Gosh. I'm really blessed to hire such a good employee.

612
00:40:54,701 --> 00:40:56,662
Qian, did you hear me?

613
00:40:56,835 --> 00:40:58,384
What a good employee we have here.

614
00:40:58,682 --> 00:41:00,243
Be nice.

615
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:02,722
Stop being so hot-tempered.

616
00:41:04,549 --> 00:41:05,670
What about your sister?

617
00:41:05,782 --> 00:41:08,451
She went home and picked up Wei Zhen Tian as well.

618
00:41:09,314 --> 00:41:11,642
Sure. Go back to work.

619
00:41:22,927 --> 00:41:24,227
Have you thought it through?

620
00:41:25,677 --> 00:41:27,362
I think you are right.

621
00:41:27,626 --> 00:41:30,016
I shouldn't be emotional.

622
00:41:30,248 --> 00:41:32,518
I acted on impulse in Chen Qing Mei's case.

623
00:41:33,661 --> 00:41:36,547
I'm willing to accept any punishment for the mistake I made.

624
00:41:37,422 --> 00:41:39,702
I hope you can give me another chance

625
00:41:39,782 --> 00:41:41,162
to participate in this case.

626
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:43,061
I will fulfill my responsibility

627
00:41:43,164 --> 00:41:44,464
and be fair.

628
00:41:48,052 --> 00:41:50,212
If you want to be involved in the case, suit yourself.

629
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:52,469
Thank you, boss.

630
00:41:52,581 --> 00:41:53,971
I will cherish it.

631
00:41:59,928 --> 00:42:02,328
There's a meeting in the afternoon. Prepare for the meeting.

632
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,020
Bao Rui, did you send the agency agreement to Chen Qing Mei?

633
00:42:21,044 --> 00:42:24,064
I did. They said they would verify it before signing and returning it.

634
00:42:24,221 --> 00:42:25,822
The amount of this case isn't too big.

635
00:42:25,925 --> 00:42:27,197
It's good enough for a practice.

636
00:42:27,221 --> 00:42:29,309
Bao Rui, you will be in charge. Cheng Yao, you will assist him.

637
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:30,773
I will be controlling the situation.

638
00:42:30,822 --> 00:42:31,997
Bao Rui and I will go to court.

639
00:42:32,021 --> 00:42:34,707
Right now, Dong Shan's body is cremated.

640
00:42:34,863 --> 00:42:36,913
Even if we find something like his hair

641
00:42:36,994 --> 00:42:39,293
that fell off before his death at his house,

642
00:42:39,382 --> 00:42:41,222
we can't compare it with his person.

643
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:43,422
We can't say the hair or skin tissue

644
00:42:43,502 --> 00:42:44,662
came directly from Dong Shan.

645
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:48,262
That means a DNA paternity test is out of the picture.

646
00:42:48,412 --> 00:42:49,712
No.

647
00:42:50,024 --> 00:42:53,021
Apart from paternity tests, DNA can also be used for kinship testing.

648
00:42:53,144 --> 00:42:56,222
A paternity test determines the relationship between a child and his parent

649
00:42:56,364 --> 00:42:58,033
by using the parents' body tissues

650
00:42:58,269 --> 00:42:59,931
but a kinship test is used

651
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:02,340
to determine the relationship of someone related by blood.

652
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:04,891
Are you talking about Dong Shan's daughter, Dong Min?

653
00:43:06,942 --> 00:43:10,002
If Chen Qing Mei is pregnant with a son,

654
00:43:10,083 --> 00:43:12,621
as long as Dong Min is willing to do the kinship test,

655
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:13,922
then...

656
00:43:15,158 --> 00:43:16,540
I don't think it proves a point.

657
00:43:16,742 --> 00:43:18,038
A kinship test is useless when it's done

658
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:20,722
on children of different genders who share the same father.
