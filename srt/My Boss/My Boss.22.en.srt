1
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:38,740
(My Boss)

2
00:01:39,927 --> 00:01:41,520
(Episode 22)

3
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,922
(Cheng Yao, I like you.)

4
00:01:44,762 --> 00:01:46,122
(I really like you.)

5
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,511
I'm no longer afraid of Deng Ming.

6
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,680
Nothing he does can hurt me.

7
00:01:54,767 --> 00:01:56,037
That's great.

8
00:01:56,513 --> 00:01:57,755
It's mainly you.

9
00:02:00,443 --> 00:02:02,670
Your kindness and what you've done for me

10
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,270
make me feel burdened.

11
00:02:09,641 --> 00:02:13,042
A good relationship should be mutual and equal between two people.

12
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,231
But I really can't get into an intimate relationship right now.

13
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,231
Right now, it's just you putting in all the effort for me.

14
00:02:21,321 --> 00:02:22,962
You will get hurt this way.

15
00:02:23,578 --> 00:02:25,007
Do you understand what I mean?

16
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:33,282
You said so much. Isn't this still a way for you to reject me?

17
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:36,858
No, it's not.

18
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:38,551
Think carefully about what I said.

19
00:02:39,505 --> 00:02:40,642
Okay.

20
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,919
Then, I'll answer you now.

21
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:47,591
I've thought about this a long time ago

22
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,719
and I've been thinking about it for years.

23
00:02:51,576 --> 00:02:53,776
Since you carried me to the medical room and I woke up,

24
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,540
I've made up my mind.

25
00:02:55,649 --> 00:02:57,241
I must spend my whole life with you, Cheng Xi.

26
00:02:57,265 --> 00:02:59,105
No one else, only you.

27
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:03,804
Yes, I know that over the years a lot has happened.

28
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:05,118
But you are still you and I am still me.

29
00:03:05,142 --> 00:03:06,857
I don't feel like anything has changed.

30
00:03:06,961 --> 00:03:10,721
The key is that now I am still very happy to like you.

31
00:03:10,801 --> 00:03:13,602
You can't take away this simple happiness from me.

32
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,270
That's unfair to me.

33
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,905
But I absolutely don't mean to force you.

34
00:03:21,407 --> 00:03:24,590
I just think you should give yourself and us a chance.

35
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,082
Of course, in our future interactions,

36
00:03:27,163 --> 00:03:30,105
if you feel uncomfortable or unsuitable,

37
00:03:30,193 --> 00:03:33,073
you can withdraw at any time. I will never interfere with your thoughts.

38
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,042
We are both still young

39
00:03:40,201 --> 00:03:41,910
and the journey ahead is still long.

40
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,582
Why do you have to assume a bad future

41
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,362
and let it affect your present?

42
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,940
Right?

43
00:03:59,525 --> 00:04:01,962
What is this piece of junk? How does it move on its own?

44
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,220
Come in.

45
00:04:29,641 --> 00:04:31,561
Boss, this is the jade bracelet.

46
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,640
Could you please return it to your mother for me?

47
00:04:35,593 --> 00:04:36,813
Return it yourself.

48
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,148
I still have to work today.

49
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:42,082
This is too valuable. I'm worried about keeping it with me.

50
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:45,681
This is your family's heirloom.

51
00:04:45,815 --> 00:04:47,442
Returning it to you is the same.

52
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,922
Boss, can you confirm that it's in perfect condition?

53
00:05:08,368 --> 00:05:09,588
Hello.

54
00:05:10,081 --> 00:05:11,301
(Cheng Yao.)

55
00:05:11,721 --> 00:05:14,471
Mom, didn't I tell you not to call my work phone?

56
00:05:14,591 --> 00:05:16,682
(I messaged you on WeChat but you didn't reply.)

57
00:05:16,874 --> 00:05:18,248
I just wanted to ask you.

58
00:05:18,373 --> 00:05:20,121
Have you completely cut ties with Qian?

59
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,598
(Do you still have any contact with him?)

60
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:23,122
I've cut ties completely.

61
00:05:23,315 --> 00:05:24,536
I have to work. I won't talk to you now.

62
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,551
(Don't be so impatient.)

63
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,140
Let me tell you.

64
00:05:28,384 --> 00:05:31,344
My best friend's son is two or three years older than you.

65
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:32,684
His name is Xue Ming.

66
00:05:32,948 --> 00:05:34,776
You guys used to play together when you were little.

67
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,041
He's on a business trip to your area.

68
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:39,681
(Go meet him tonight and have a meal together.)

69
00:05:39,761 --> 00:05:41,362
(Help me entertain him, all right?)

70
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:42,801
I'm telling you in advance.

71
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,881
If it's just entertaining, I can help you.

72
00:05:44,961 --> 00:05:46,602
But if it's a blind date, I won't go.

73
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,042
Don't introduce anyone randomly.

74
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,056
Just think of it as making a new friend. There's no harm in that.

75
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,202
It's settled then.

76
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,162
- I have to go now. - I...

77
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,927
Your family arranged a blind date for you?

78
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,674
Don't mention it.

79
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,710
He's quite handsome. Good.

80
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,220
I'll introduce him to you.

81
00:06:15,623 --> 00:06:17,904
Tan Ying, I have a case and I wanted to ask you about it.

82
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,110
I almost forgot about the important thing.

83
00:06:22,564 --> 00:06:23,946
I have to go out and get some materials.

84
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,513
If there's a call later, please help me answer it.

85
00:06:25,537 --> 00:06:27,117
- Okay. - Thank you.

86
00:06:32,154 --> 00:06:33,374
What case?

87
00:06:36,214 --> 00:06:38,303
(Mom, I'm really busy at work today.)

88
00:06:38,384 --> 00:06:40,459
(After thinking about it, I won't go out for dinner tonight.)

89
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,723
(Can you tell Mr. Xue about it for me?)

90
00:06:46,013 --> 00:06:47,122
(Okay.)

91
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:32,216
Boss, you've been to the bathroom three times already.

92
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,800
Are your kidneys not doing well lately?

93
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:35,297
Goji berry tea is good for the kidneys.

94
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:36,402
Are you crazy?

95
00:07:39,056 --> 00:07:41,337
Is there something wrong with goji berry for the kidneys?

96
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,722
Tan, who gave you such beautiful flowers?

97
00:07:44,896 --> 00:07:46,116
Guess.

98
00:07:46,771 --> 00:07:48,202
Nice.

99
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:52,522
It's so pretty. Who gave it to you?

100
00:07:52,798 --> 00:07:55,719
It's not for me. The receptionist said someone gifted it to Cheng Yao.

101
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,320
It should be her blind date tonight.

102
00:07:57,462 --> 00:07:58,681
Blind date?

103
00:07:58,761 --> 00:08:00,241
When has Cheng Yao had a blind date?

104
00:08:00,321 --> 00:08:01,361
Is he reliable?

105
00:08:01,441 --> 00:08:03,373
They were childhood friends.

106
00:08:03,454 --> 00:08:05,125
I saw his photos and he's quite handsome.

107
00:08:05,314 --> 00:08:07,280
He looks a bit like Lawyer Qian,

108
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,759
but with a sunny disposition.

109
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,955
- So handsome. - Then, it's like hitting the jackpot.

110
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:13,479
If it were me, I wouldn't just go on a date. I'd propose right away.

111
00:08:13,503 --> 00:08:15,703
- Lu, be more reserved. - Don't you all need to work?

112
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,280
If I see you guys being so idle again,

113
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,400
don't even bother asking for your salary this month.

114
00:08:24,121 --> 00:08:25,882
Why is he so angry today?

115
00:08:25,982 --> 00:08:27,612
Is it because of Cheng Yao's gossip?

116
00:08:28,161 --> 00:08:29,381
How is that possible?

117
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,160
Why would the boss be interested in a mortal's personal life?

118
00:08:32,417 --> 00:08:33,802
It's not even my personal life.

119
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,509
He won't care at all.

120
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,202
Keep supplementing your kidneys

121
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,060
and your brain.

122
00:08:54,297 --> 00:08:55,517
Yao Yao.

123
00:08:58,473 --> 00:08:59,522
Yao Yao.

124
00:09:01,001 --> 00:09:02,496
You're much prettier than in the photos.

125
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,922
No, you're getting more and more beautiful.

126
00:09:11,297 --> 00:09:12,337
Xue Ming?

127
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,177
Yes, it's me.

128
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:15,670
Why are you here?

129
00:09:16,136 --> 00:09:18,682
Oh, your mom said you didn't want to go out to eat.

130
00:09:18,763 --> 00:09:21,473
You're busy with work so she gave me your home address.

131
00:09:22,473 --> 00:09:24,794
It's our first time having a meal together.

132
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,095
And it's at your house.

133
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,562
It's my honor.

134
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,860
Come on in and have a seat.

135
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:32,922
Okay.

136
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:34,442
Yao Yao,

137
00:09:35,152 --> 00:09:37,562
did you like the flowers I sent to your law firm today?

138
00:09:39,483 --> 00:09:41,482
You sent flowers to my law firm?

139
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,122
Your mom gave me all your addresses.

140
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,389
What's wrong? You don't like them?

141
00:09:49,096 --> 00:09:50,316
I like them.

142
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,950
Thank you. Come in.

143
00:10:01,216 --> 00:10:02,727
This is too much.

144
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,324
Yao Yao, you're such a good cook.

145
00:10:05,386 --> 00:10:07,871
Whoever marries you will be incredibly lucky.

146
00:10:09,201 --> 00:10:11,906
Cooking at home saves money and is hygienic.

147
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:13,068
Let's eat.

148
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:14,162
Okay.

149
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,881
I heard from your dad and mom

150
00:10:22,992 --> 00:10:24,952
that you had a bad experience with a jerk before.

151
00:10:24,992 --> 00:10:26,223
And you've just become single.

152
00:10:29,257 --> 00:10:30,477
Yeah, in a way.

153
00:10:31,654 --> 00:10:33,694
That just shows that the jerk is blind.

154
00:10:33,775 --> 00:10:35,122
With such a precious gem in front of him,

155
00:10:35,146 --> 00:10:36,506
he doesn't know how to cherish it.

156
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:40,733
Xue Ming.

157
00:10:41,201 --> 00:10:43,400
I bet my mom went to complain to your mom,

158
00:10:43,536 --> 00:10:45,687
saying how miserable I am after the breakup.

159
00:10:46,401 --> 00:10:47,601
Don't take it seriously.

160
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,689
And don't try to comfort me or flatter me.

161
00:10:50,991 --> 00:10:52,952
I'm perfectly fine. In fact, I'm in a great mood.

162
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,914
Don't feel pressured into the blind date by your mom.

163
00:10:55,995 --> 00:10:57,882
Just enjoy a nice meal today.

164
00:10:57,972 --> 00:10:59,359
I'm not just saying this to flatter you.

165
00:10:59,383 --> 00:11:00,774
I really mean it.

166
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,856
Yao Yao, even though we haven't been in touch for over a decade,

167
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,269
I still remember you.

168
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,860
You haven't changed at all.

169
00:11:07,624 --> 00:11:10,525
No, you've become even more beautiful than before.

170
00:11:13,296 --> 00:11:17,082
By the way, you work in Lin, right?

171
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,661
- Yes. - You haven't met your dream girl after so many years?

172
00:11:21,741 --> 00:11:23,932
I'm transferring to the headquarters here next month.

173
00:11:24,289 --> 00:11:26,815
Yao Yao, we'll be in the same city after that.

174
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:28,991
We're also from the same hometown and our families know each other well.

175
00:11:29,015 --> 00:11:30,406
We have a foundation of feelings.

176
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,789
I really think

177
00:11:34,878 --> 00:11:36,308
we can give it a try.

178
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,800
I think it's a bit too rushed.

179
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,100
Let's eat first.

180
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,362
Is that too rushed?

181
00:11:45,136 --> 00:11:47,167
We can start as friends.

182
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,670
Yao Yao, actually I've liked you for a long time.

183
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,989
You're really noisy.

184
00:12:02,265 --> 00:12:03,882
Seafood for dinner today?

185
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,162
Good.

186
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,351
Yao Yao, this is?

187
00:12:09,719 --> 00:12:12,580
My former housemate.

188
00:12:12,661 --> 00:12:15,381
He just moved out recently. He must have come back to get something.

189
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,322
He's also my colleague.

190
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,700
Colleague.

191
00:12:20,504 --> 00:12:21,724
Colleague?

192
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,470
Qian, why are you here?

193
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,320
I wasn't feeling well this afternoon

194
00:12:28,472 --> 00:12:29,882
so I came back to take a nap.

195
00:12:30,621 --> 00:12:32,602
Did I disturb you two?

196
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,100
If you mind, I can leave.

197
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,261
Hello, Qian.

198
00:12:39,488 --> 00:12:40,708
My name is Xue Ming.

199
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,880
Yao Yao and I have been classmates for over 10 years.

200
00:12:45,768 --> 00:12:48,442
Since you are her colleague, let's eat together.

201
00:12:51,034 --> 00:12:52,402
Bring me a pair of chopsticks.

202
00:13:15,192 --> 00:13:17,112
This is the best meal I've ever had in my life.

203
00:13:17,272 --> 00:13:18,322
I swear.

204
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:22,079
Yao Yao, your cooking skills are amazing.

205
00:13:23,153 --> 00:13:27,073
I remember the last time you made abalone for me, it was delicious.

206
00:13:27,231 --> 00:13:28,451
This meal is mediocre.

207
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,973
Yao Yao, if I had known, we could have gone out to eat instead.

208
00:13:31,997 --> 00:13:33,517
So, you wouldn't have to work so hard.

209
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:35,101
I'm transferring here next month.

210
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,882
I'll cover all the dinners for a month

211
00:13:37,054 --> 00:13:39,124
as a way to thank you for this meal.

212
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,511
We'll need to work overtime next month.

213
00:13:42,246 --> 00:13:44,436
- Why? - We have a lot of cases.

214
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,360
The entire team will have to work overtime.

215
00:13:46,837 --> 00:13:49,357
Yao Yao, your job as a lawyer is so tough.

216
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,320
You have to work overtime for an entire month.

217
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:55,221
Have you ever thought about changing to a different job?

218
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,789
You studied law, so you are well suited to work in the government sector.

219
00:13:59,961 --> 00:14:01,705
Or you could work in a state-owned enterprise as a legal counsel.

220
00:14:01,729 --> 00:14:02,929
It would be less stressful.

221
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,880
Right, Cheng Yao.

222
00:14:04,975 --> 00:14:06,162
What do you think?

223
00:14:07,016 --> 00:14:08,806
I prefer being a lawyer.

224
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,601
I enjoy the daily challenges and the excitement of this career.

225
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,749
I know you like it, but you're a girl.

226
00:14:17,471 --> 00:14:19,373
You'll eventually get married and have children.

227
00:14:19,397 --> 00:14:20,986
After starting a family,

228
00:14:21,201 --> 00:14:23,751
it will be difficult to balance such a busy job.

229
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,710
I believe that peace is a blessing.

230
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,362
Having a stable family

231
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,190
and coming home after work

232
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,996
to take care of household chores

233
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,688
and spend time with me and our children

234
00:14:33,712 --> 00:14:35,002
would be great.

235
00:14:37,535 --> 00:14:38,779
So, based on what you're saying,

236
00:14:38,803 --> 00:14:40,537
why not ask Cheng Yao to be a homemaker,

237
00:14:40,618 --> 00:14:41,886
as it aligns more with your preferences?

238
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,815
That's not the case. It's already the modern era.

239
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,922
Women must have a job to supplement the household expenses.

240
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:48,915
This way, as a husband,

241
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,240
I will be less stressed about the family's finances.

242
00:14:53,321 --> 00:14:55,830
You want your wife to take care of the household chores and the children,

243
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:57,642
but also make her earn money and work.

244
00:14:57,792 --> 00:14:59,082
Why does she need you for?

245
00:14:59,253 --> 00:15:01,197
Cheng Yao already said that within two years,

246
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:02,998
she doesn't plan on dating or getting married.

247
00:15:03,022 --> 00:15:04,411
She wants to focus on her career.

248
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,545
And the people around her are all so outstanding.

249
00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:08,002
Her standards are high now.

250
00:15:08,656 --> 00:15:11,647
In fact, career and household chores

251
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,386
are not contradictory.

252
00:15:13,682 --> 00:15:15,042
Yao Yao is so outstanding.

253
00:15:15,144 --> 00:15:16,344
She can definitely do it.

254
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,640
Right?

255
00:15:17,808 --> 00:15:19,282
She's already doing very well now.

256
00:15:19,402 --> 00:15:20,893
She doesn't need your approval and recognition.

257
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:23,001
And the main point of what I just said is that

258
00:15:23,112 --> 00:15:25,352
currently, her career is more attractive to her.

259
00:15:25,472 --> 00:15:26,787
The people she has met throughout her career

260
00:15:26,811 --> 00:15:28,851
have been incredible and beyond your comprehension.

261
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,941
So, please don't use your narrow-mindedness

262
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,122
to view Cheng Yao's vast future.

263
00:15:39,081 --> 00:15:40,325
I'm going to the restroom.

264
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:41,626
You guys may eat slowly.

265
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,294
Hey, brother. You seem to have some hostility toward me.

266
00:15:52,624 --> 00:15:54,064
Do you also like Cheng Yao?

267
00:15:54,184 --> 00:15:55,504
What does it have to do with you?

268
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,031
But you always target me. Why is that?

269
00:15:58,161 --> 00:15:59,359
Have we met before?

270
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,150
Or have I offended you in the past?

271
00:16:02,067 --> 00:16:04,400
I don't think you are someone worth getting to know.

272
00:16:04,511 --> 00:16:06,430
But you have been obstructing

273
00:16:06,528 --> 00:16:08,426
my normal communication with Yao Yao.

274
00:16:11,798 --> 00:16:13,709
Could it be that my Yao Yao

275
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:15,802
has offended you?

276
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:19,487
If she accidentally offended you at work,

277
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,800
I apologize on her behalf.

278
00:16:20,921 --> 00:16:24,280
She is a simple person who doesn't understand these social norms.

279
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,560
She's just a young girl. Don't hold grudges.

280
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,081
Are you close with Cheng Yao?

281
00:16:28,192 --> 00:16:32,278
You didn't even ask her permission to call her "my Yao Yao."

282
00:16:32,848 --> 00:16:34,362
Do you really understand her?

283
00:16:34,776 --> 00:16:36,549
We've known each other for over 10 years.

284
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,100
Yao...

285
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:43,392
Cheng Yao, let me help you tidy up.

286
00:16:43,537 --> 00:16:44,697
No need.

287
00:16:44,778 --> 00:16:46,178
You're a guest. I can do it myself.

288
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,460
Why don't you sit for a while?

289
00:16:48,537 --> 00:16:49,682
Okay.

290
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,815
You just sit like that, huh?

291
00:17:05,911 --> 00:17:09,036
It's getting late. I just remembered I have an early meeting tomorrow.

292
00:17:09,117 --> 00:17:10,468
I'll go back to the hotel first.

293
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,177
Thank you for your hospitality tonight. Look at me...

294
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:24,552
Don't worry about it. Come again next time.

295
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,362
I'll entertain you with my Yao Yao.

296
00:17:39,009 --> 00:17:40,050
I'll leave now.

297
00:17:40,161 --> 00:17:41,381
I'll see you off.

298
00:17:43,361 --> 00:17:45,322
Sorry for not being a good host today.

299
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,659
It's already good enough.

300
00:17:46,937 --> 00:17:48,122
Okay, then I'll leave first.

301
00:17:48,221 --> 00:17:51,082
- Be careful on the way. - Okay, no need to see me off.

302
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,981
Boss, what do you mean?

303
00:18:02,062 --> 00:18:03,442
What do you mean by

304
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,020
"my Yao Yao"?

305
00:18:06,008 --> 00:18:07,602
I haven't even asked you what you mean.

306
00:18:07,792 --> 00:18:09,183
You just rejected

307
00:18:10,682 --> 00:18:11,810
my mom's bracelet.

308
00:18:11,921 --> 00:18:13,812
Now, you're happily going on a blind date.

309
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:15,113
What do you mean?

310
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,900
Just because I rejected your mother's bracelet,

311
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,160
you have to make me feel so embarrassed

312
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,791
and get scolded by my mom?

313
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:24,197
Is it necessary?

314
00:18:27,068 --> 00:18:28,522
The food is really bad.

315
00:18:34,585 --> 00:18:36,055
What a strange person.

316
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:40,920
He always does things that make people overthink.

317
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,960
He ate so much even though he thought it's bad?

318
00:19:06,535 --> 00:19:07,577
Work is over.

319
00:19:09,229 --> 00:19:10,962
Let's go, come to my house to play cards.

320
00:19:11,385 --> 00:19:12,577
Wang Lu, you all should come too.

321
00:19:12,601 --> 00:19:14,522
- I'm not going. - I'll go.

322
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,720
Great.

323
00:19:15,816 --> 00:19:16,817
Then, I'll go too.

324
00:19:16,936 --> 00:19:18,156
Four people are enough.

325
00:19:18,997 --> 00:19:20,919
Bao, please take me with you.

326
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,442
Just kidding. Let's go together.

327
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,640
What about Cheng Yao? Is she coming?

328
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,800
She left early to meet up with her childhood friend.

329
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,761
Cheng Yao is amazing.

330
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,320
This is called overtaking on a curve.

331
00:19:32,712 --> 00:19:34,298
Speaking of childhood friends, I also have one.

332
00:19:34,322 --> 00:19:35,913
He works at the court and is one year younger than me.

333
00:19:35,937 --> 00:19:37,097
Tan Ying, are you interested?

334
00:19:37,193 --> 00:19:38,273
Let me introduce him to you.

335
00:19:38,297 --> 00:19:39,517
Tan Ying doesn't need it.

336
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,710
How do you know?

337
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,551
Be aware of your identity.

338
00:19:44,441 --> 00:19:45,661
Who are you?

339
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,162
I...

340
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,380
Buddy.

341
00:19:50,533 --> 00:19:51,622
Buddy.

342
00:19:51,999 --> 00:19:54,136
There's nothing wrong with caring about my buddy.

343
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,180
Buddy.

344
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,320
As a buddy,

345
00:20:00,401 --> 00:20:02,440
you should introduce a boyfriend to Tan Ying.

346
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,640
That's what buddies do.

347
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:05,002
Come on, buddy.

348
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:10,896
Tan Ying, I'm really worried about you.

349
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,056
Hurry up and get a boyfriend.

350
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,300
Look at Cheng Yao.

351
00:20:13,943 --> 00:20:16,173
Isn't it spring already?

352
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,540
What spring?

353
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,562
I'm talking about Cheng Yao.

354
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,402
She's going on a blind date. It's her springtime.

355
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,122
Ask her where she is now.

356
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,256
I didn't expect the dishes here to have such large portions.

357
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,750
It feels a bit wasteful.

358
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,260
It's okay.

359
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,361
This time, I'll treat you.

360
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:33,670
How can that be?

361
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,178
We agreed that I would treat you.

362
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,697
You don't have to worry about this meal.

363
00:20:36,721 --> 00:20:38,861
I've already paid for it. Next time, it's your turn.

364
00:20:39,929 --> 00:20:41,922
Okay, thank you.

365
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:43,671
Don't be polite to me.

366
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:44,802
Here.

367
00:20:45,298 --> 00:20:47,962
- Thank you. - Last time, we finally got to meet each other

368
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,122
and your housemate ruined it for us.

369
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:52,507
Now, it's just the two of us.

370
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,295
No need to be formal.

371
00:20:54,376 --> 00:20:55,866
Here, try this.

372
00:20:55,947 --> 00:20:57,697
The boiled beef is very flavorful.

373
00:20:57,778 --> 00:20:58,853
- Try it. - Thank you.

374
00:20:58,934 --> 00:21:00,830
The trend abroad is to have separate meals.

375
00:21:00,911 --> 00:21:02,602
Why are you still picking food for her?

376
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,435
If you're infected with Helicobacter pylori,

377
00:21:04,459 --> 00:21:06,002
wouldn't you have passed it on to her?

378
00:21:06,337 --> 00:21:09,384
And once infected, the chances of getting stomach cancer

379
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,602
increase by 2.7 to 12 times.

380
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,750
No, Yao Yao. I'm not infected with Helicobacter pylori.

381
00:21:15,521 --> 00:21:18,383
We lawyers are most concerned with evidence.

382
00:21:19,438 --> 00:21:22,240
Words alone are not enough. Wait until you have your medical report.

383
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,025
Boss, my friend and I

384
00:21:24,106 --> 00:21:26,039
are having dinner together after work.

385
00:21:26,168 --> 00:21:27,388
Why are you here?

386
00:21:27,641 --> 00:21:28,920
You own this street, don't you?

387
00:21:29,023 --> 00:21:30,243
Why can't I come?

388
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,670
What I mean is,

389
00:21:33,881 --> 00:21:34,920
do you have work for me?

390
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You can call or email me.

391
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,591
This place doesn't really suit you.

392
00:21:45,176 --> 00:21:46,396
Yao Yao.

393
00:21:46,601 --> 00:21:47,882
He's your boss,

394
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,190
not your housemate?

395
00:21:52,858 --> 00:21:54,698
Well, it's a bit complicated.

396
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,740
But, my housemate is really my boss.

397
00:22:03,807 --> 00:22:06,118
Mr. Qian, do you mind if I call you that?

398
00:22:07,251 --> 00:22:08,670
Although work is important,

399
00:22:08,816 --> 00:22:10,796
it's already after work hours.

400
00:22:11,136 --> 00:22:13,116
Cheng Yao also has her own personal time.

401
00:22:14,361 --> 00:22:15,592
Is it okay if we do it this way?

402
00:22:15,616 --> 00:22:17,882
After our date,

403
00:22:18,205 --> 00:22:19,561
I will accompany her

404
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:22,280
to finish the work you assigned even if it means working overtime.

405
00:22:22,304 --> 00:22:26,384
Besides, your identity, appearance, and attire

406
00:22:26,736 --> 00:22:29,792
are not suitable for eating here, right?

407
00:22:32,534 --> 00:22:35,880
The food here might be made with gutter oil.

408
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,750
Your stomach is precious.

409
00:22:38,312 --> 00:22:39,552
I'm afraid you can't handle it.

410
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,247
Did the boss know that you slandered his dishes?

411
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,720
No, not that.

412
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,919
- This... - It's fine.

413
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,598
This restaurant is really not your usual style.

414
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:52,359
I'm afraid you won't be used to it, right?

415
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:06,029
Oh yeah, Yao Yao.

416
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,440
I haven't asked you yet.

417
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,521
What are your standards for choosing a partner?

418
00:23:11,655 --> 00:23:12,896
What kind of guys do you like?

419
00:23:12,977 --> 00:23:15,802
- I like... - She likes men who are at least 1.8m tall.

420
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,591
Look at you. You're half a head shorter than me.

421
00:23:19,744 --> 00:23:23,615
Also, she likes men who are excellent in their careers.

422
00:23:23,998 --> 00:23:26,948
I was just named the Outstanding Worker this year.

423
00:23:28,525 --> 00:23:29,899
But the kind of excellence she likes is

424
00:23:29,923 --> 00:23:32,282
someone who is well-known in the industry.

425
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,750
What's wrong with you?

426
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,559
Even if you're her boss,

427
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,711
you're interfering too much in her personal life.

428
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,951
I came here today not as Cheng Yao's boss,

429
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:44,717
but as Cheng Yao's boyfriend.

430
00:23:48,641 --> 00:23:50,111
What?

431
00:23:54,881 --> 00:23:56,710
Yes, Cheng Yao is pursuing me.

432
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,240
At first, I was very resistant.

433
00:23:58,369 --> 00:24:01,470
But after a fierce internal struggle,

434
00:24:01,991 --> 00:24:03,300
I have come to my senses.

435
00:24:04,097 --> 00:24:05,178
I allow you to pursue me.

436
00:24:05,259 --> 00:24:06,904
No, you got it wrong. That's not what I meant.

437
00:24:06,928 --> 00:24:09,448
- That's exactly what you meant. - I really didn't mean that.

438
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:30,162
You guys enjoy your meal.

439
00:24:30,983 --> 00:24:32,122
I'll leave first.

440
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,300
This order.

441
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,980
I paid for it.

442
00:24:43,896 --> 00:24:45,042
Um...

443
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,839
No, boss. Do you have to trick me like this to be happy?

444
00:24:51,985 --> 00:24:53,774
I really didn't mean to embarrass you.

445
00:24:53,936 --> 00:24:56,402
The gift was sent by the merchant by mistake.

446
00:24:56,842 --> 00:24:59,922
My intention was just to get a promotion and raise, nothing else.

447
00:25:01,894 --> 00:25:04,164
Cheng Yao, I've thought about it.

448
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:06,042
I am an innocent third party.

449
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,628
About the fact of wrong delivery between you and the merchant,

450
00:25:08,652 --> 00:25:10,362
as a third party, I am not aware of it.

451
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,827
My misunderstanding stems from unawareness, without any subjective malice.

452
00:25:14,192 --> 00:25:15,598
So the negative impact and consequences

453
00:25:15,622 --> 00:25:17,113
caused by the wrong delivery between you two

454
00:25:17,137 --> 00:25:19,282
cannot be claimed from me, the innocent third party.

455
00:25:19,418 --> 00:25:21,282
The mistakes made due to misunderstandings

456
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:24,316
and the resulting losses caused by my decisions cannot be claimed from me.

457
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,179
You can only claim from the merchant who made the wrong delivery.

458
00:25:26,203 --> 00:25:28,922
So you must cooperate with my decision.

459
00:25:30,192 --> 00:25:31,630
What do you want to do then?

460
00:25:31,711 --> 00:25:34,472
Anyway, there is no money involved. You can suggest other conditions.

461
00:25:35,362 --> 00:25:36,504
I am not interested in your money.

462
00:25:36,528 --> 00:25:38,768
- How many meals do I have to cook? - I'm tired of it.

463
00:25:39,745 --> 00:25:41,242
No, have you changed...

464
00:25:46,046 --> 00:25:48,276
You wouldn't be actually trying to date me, would you?

465
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,690
Impossible.

466
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:20,802
As someone content with a simple life, how could you fall in love?

467
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,376
You said you would cook, right?

468
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,390
Okay. Then, serve me for three days.

469
00:26:32,018 --> 00:26:33,025
Okay, three days.

470
00:26:33,106 --> 00:26:35,602
After three days, can you let this matter go?

471
00:26:36,153 --> 00:26:38,953
Can you sign a service contract for me? Otherwise, I won't be at ease.

472
00:26:44,261 --> 00:26:45,849
What's wrong with him?

473
00:27:27,054 --> 00:27:28,524
Welcome.

474
00:27:28,888 --> 00:27:30,408
Here are some fruits I bought for you.

475
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,802
Why did you buy so many again?

476
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,983
You bought so many again.

477
00:27:39,064 --> 00:27:41,562
Look, I haven't finished the ones you bought last time.

478
00:27:41,681 --> 00:27:43,089
Take some back with you tonight.

479
00:27:43,179 --> 00:27:44,538
Leaving here...

480
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,460
Are you in a bad mood?

481
00:27:49,145 --> 00:27:50,186
What happened?

482
00:27:51,841 --> 00:27:53,122
Qian Heng.

483
00:27:56,233 --> 00:27:57,833
It was his birthday before,

484
00:27:57,929 --> 00:27:59,602
so I gave him a gift.

485
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,190
But the gift accidentally mixed up with another's confession box.

486
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:05,556
He thought I was confessing to him.

487
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,522
Previously, he had been telling me

488
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,633
not to have any illusions about him.

489
00:28:11,009 --> 00:28:14,235
But now, he suddenly says he can accept my confession.

490
00:28:14,316 --> 00:28:16,066
I don't know what to do.

491
00:28:17,354 --> 00:28:19,882
Someone like Qian Heng, who is inexperienced in love,

492
00:28:20,113 --> 00:28:22,842
may take a bit longer to react.

493
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,730
I feel like he likes you.

494
00:28:25,849 --> 00:28:28,728
Otherwise, why would he come with you to see me that day

495
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,790
and agree to take on my case?

496
00:28:30,896 --> 00:28:33,795
He did all of that because he must have considered your feelings.

497
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,200
But he also asked me to know my place.

498
00:28:39,543 --> 00:28:40,652
He's so outstanding.

499
00:28:40,733 --> 00:28:42,243
How could he possibly like me?

500
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:48,242
I'm afraid he's just caught up in the moment.

501
00:28:48,384 --> 00:28:51,384
How can I continue to work in the legal field if we break up in the future?

502
00:28:52,441 --> 00:28:53,661
You're right.

503
00:28:53,936 --> 00:28:55,765
You can't easily believe what he says.

504
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:57,801
At the very least, you need to make sure

505
00:28:57,878 --> 00:28:59,839
that he really can't live without you

506
00:28:59,935 --> 00:29:01,726
and really wants to be with you.

507
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,121
(My assistant has a pursuer.)

508
00:29:11,231 --> 00:29:12,911
(How can I prevent them from interacting?)

509
00:29:14,527 --> 00:29:16,479
(Taking up all of your assistant's time.)

510
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,242
(Physically separating them from meeting.)

511
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
(Day 1)

512
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:39,602
So the first day of service is for me to help you clean the yard?

513
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,750
Isn't this something a professional housekeeper can do?

514
00:29:46,528 --> 00:29:48,678
I'm clumsy and can't clean well.

515
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,842
I just want to train your hands-on ability.

516
00:29:58,361 --> 00:29:59,581
So annoying.

517
00:30:15,492 --> 00:30:16,722
I can't reach it.

518
00:30:23,628 --> 00:30:24,889
Qian Heng is an annoying person.

519
00:30:24,913 --> 00:30:26,502
Watch how I snap you.

520
00:30:39,325 --> 00:30:40,802
You're quite enthusiastic.

521
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:51,482
(Day 2)

522
00:30:54,601 --> 00:30:55,950
I want this gray rabbit.

523
00:30:56,121 --> 00:30:57,341
Get it for me.

524
00:30:58,641 --> 00:31:00,561
It takes 3,000 points to get it.

525
00:31:00,664 --> 00:31:02,013
Do you think I can do it?

526
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,493
(Challenge failed)

527
00:31:52,122 --> 00:31:54,042
(Total score: 805 points)

528
00:31:58,201 --> 00:31:59,750
I really can't.

529
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,910
With my abilities, I can't get the rabbit.

530
00:32:08,201 --> 00:32:09,322
How about this?

531
00:32:09,601 --> 00:32:11,032
I'll ask the boss to sell me

532
00:32:11,161 --> 00:32:12,872
the rabbit at a discounted price. Is that okay?

533
00:32:12,896 --> 00:32:14,522
No. I want you to win it.

534
00:32:14,823 --> 00:32:17,094
No. Are you deliberately messing with me?

535
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,670
I remember you used to not like this kind of rabbit.

536
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,111
Really? Did I say that?

537
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,820
I really don't know what I did to offend you.

538
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:45,842
(Day 3)

539
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,842
Boss.

540
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:13,162
Cheng Yao, come to my villa now and do the cleaning.

541
00:33:14,161 --> 00:33:17,351
No, your villa must be at least 800-900 square meters.

542
00:33:17,951 --> 00:33:19,700
How can I clean it all up?

543
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,361
Besides, I played basketball all day yesterday and my hands are sore.

544
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,559
You don't have to come

545
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,120
but you should know the consequences.

546
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,780
I...

547
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,014
Qian Heng.

548
00:33:35,817 --> 00:33:37,522
Your life won't end well!

549
00:33:38,121 --> 00:33:40,031
You should clean the living room first.

550
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,922
I have a meeting in the study room later

551
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:55,682
and I won't be back for a few hours.

552
00:33:56,121 --> 00:33:57,341
You can...

553
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,100
Handle it yourself.

554
00:34:11,647 --> 00:34:13,208
(Why are you working so hard?)

555
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:14,922
(Don't you know how to be lazy?)

556
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,700
It's so frustrating.

557
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,482
(You're so stupid. I'm not around.)

558
00:35:24,779 --> 00:35:26,147
(Don't do it seriously.)

559
00:35:26,342 --> 00:35:28,302
(Why do you have to tire yourself out like this?)

560
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,200
Boss.

561
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,819
Work overtime in the office with me to sort out documents.

562
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:48,910
Why?

563
00:35:50,434 --> 00:35:52,576
I don't want to go. I'm too tired these past two days.

564
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,911
Can't we go tomorrow instead?

565
00:35:54,241 --> 00:35:56,480
No. There are still six hours left.

566
00:35:56,616 --> 00:35:57,836
You can't refuse.

567
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:04,440
What are you going to do anyway?

568
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:06,039
So what if I refuse?

569
00:36:06,147 --> 00:36:08,124
I came to Junheng & Co to become a good lawyer,

570
00:36:08,205 --> 00:36:09,267
not to be bossed around by you.

571
00:36:09,291 --> 00:36:11,851
Why can't I refuse when you want me to work in a servile manner?

572
00:36:13,361 --> 00:36:16,360
On the first day, you made me come to your place early in the morning.

573
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:18,275
Under the scorching sun, I cleaned your windows,

574
00:36:18,299 --> 00:36:20,119
scooped the pool, and mowed the lawn for you

575
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,720
while you were in your air-conditioned room, enjoying yourself.

576
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,560
On the second day, you made me play basketball.

577
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,558
I clearly couldn't shoot. But you made me shoot all day.

578
00:36:28,582 --> 00:36:30,863
And I didn't make a single shot. I even injured my hands.

579
00:36:32,426 --> 00:36:34,816
On the third day, you made me come and clean your house.

580
00:36:34,897 --> 00:36:37,686
I cleaned your house inside and out.

581
00:36:38,401 --> 00:36:40,039
And I only got to sleep for 10 minutes.

582
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,762
Then, you dragged me up to work overtime.

583
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,801
What did I do wrong?

584
00:36:44,881 --> 00:36:46,390
It was just a wrong gift.

585
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,122
Is it worth making you

586
00:36:50,691 --> 00:36:52,282
so unhappy?

587
00:36:53,656 --> 00:36:55,937
You just can't let it go. So you deliberately torture me.

588
00:36:56,084 --> 00:36:58,002
Cheng Yao, don't be angry.

589
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,380
It's all my fault.

590
00:36:59,641 --> 00:37:00,802
It's my mistake, not yours.

591
00:37:00,944 --> 00:37:02,164
What mistake did you make?

592
00:37:02,456 --> 00:37:03,936
If there's a mistake, it's mine.

593
00:37:04,113 --> 00:37:06,559
I must have lost my mind.

594
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,270
That's why I had to give you a gift.

595
00:37:09,281 --> 00:37:10,551
So unpredictable.

596
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,420
I quit now.

597
00:37:14,721 --> 00:37:16,520
- Cheng Yao. - What are you doing?

598
00:37:16,632 --> 00:37:17,951
I'm not deliberately torturing you.

599
00:37:17,975 --> 00:37:19,562
- It's because... - Why?

600
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,420
Cheng Yao.

601
00:37:24,321 --> 00:37:25,361
Cheng Yao.

602
00:37:25,441 --> 00:37:26,480
Cheng Yao.

603
00:37:26,575 --> 00:37:27,795
I like you.

604
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,511
What are you saying?

605
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,792
I've been taking up all your time and making you do this and that.

606
00:37:46,816 --> 00:37:48,795
I'm not doing it on purpose to torture you.

607
00:37:49,054 --> 00:37:50,616
I just want to find a reason to be with you.

608
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,094
I thought by doing this, you wouldn't have

609
00:37:52,118 --> 00:37:53,678
to go on that blind date with Xue Ming.

610
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,190
So you're jealous?

611
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:10,741
I don't believe it.

612
00:38:11,242 --> 00:38:14,881
Liking someone can make the feeling of affection very apparent.

613
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:16,682
I can't sense your affection.

614
00:38:16,881 --> 00:38:19,642
It must be the wrong gift. Now, you're playing tricks on me.

615
00:38:19,757 --> 00:38:20,801
I'm not lying to you.

616
00:38:20,913 --> 00:38:22,016
I don't care about those things.

617
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,310
How can you believe me?

618
00:38:34,184 --> 00:38:35,442
I really like you.

619
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,631
(Did I hear wrong?)

620
00:38:39,314 --> 00:38:41,402
(My boss likes me.)

621
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,300
You...

622
00:39:21,566 --> 00:39:23,835
(He couldn't really like me, right?)

623
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:25,079
(Oh my god.)

624
00:39:25,179 --> 00:39:27,509
(How am I going to face him at work tomorrow?)

625
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,780
Stop looking.

626
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,522
The boss has a meeting with a big client.

627
00:39:46,695 --> 00:39:48,055
He won't come to the office today.

628
00:39:48,721 --> 00:39:49,941
I didn't look for him.

629
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,801
Do you really think I'm stupid?

630
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,400
Can't I see through this small matter?

631
00:39:56,092 --> 00:39:57,361
Still hiding it from me?

632
00:39:57,841 --> 00:39:59,119
You took two days off.

633
00:39:59,202 --> 00:40:01,071
You're afraid of getting scolded by him, huh?

634
00:40:01,696 --> 00:40:03,736
Don't worry. He hasn't come in for two days either.

635
00:40:29,752 --> 00:40:31,142
When did this happen?

636
00:40:33,281 --> 00:40:34,925
What do you mean?

637
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,820
Forehead.

638
00:40:52,481 --> 00:40:53,802
On Lawyer Qian's birthday.

639
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,880
Be more careful. He has been secretly in love with me for a long time.

640
00:41:00,175 --> 00:41:02,042
You guys should also be more careful.

641
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,529
There are so many people.

642
00:41:03,638 --> 00:41:06,016
I don't care about being found out. It won't affect our work anyway.

643
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,070
Life is short. Let's enjoy it.

644
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,228
- Fei is so careful. He definitely won't affect the work, right? - Yes.

645
00:41:11,309 --> 00:41:12,529
Give it to me.

646
00:41:12,921 --> 00:41:14,141
I'll do it myself.

647
00:41:14,929 --> 00:41:16,362
Sorry, I'll leave first.

648
00:41:16,721 --> 00:41:17,941
Clean up before coming out.

649
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,600
Bravo, Fei.

650
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,270
You subtly captured the beauty of Junheng & Co.

651
00:41:31,881 --> 00:41:33,750
Sincerity is the most important thing.

652
00:41:34,441 --> 00:41:36,591
Don't tell Bao Rui.

653
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:38,693
As his buddy, I want to tell him in person.

654
00:41:40,488 --> 00:41:42,842
- Anymore? - Go wash up in the bathroom.

655
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,700
Okay.

656
00:41:45,352 --> 00:41:46,842
Don't worry. I won't say anything.

657
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,740
You're so understanding.

658
00:41:51,341 --> 00:41:53,842
(Could it be that the atmosphere of love is contagious?)

659
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,642
(The boss didn't come to work today. What is he up to?)

660
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,402
(He won't ambush me at home, right?)

661
00:42:07,279 --> 00:42:08,361
Cheng Yao.

662
00:42:08,499 --> 00:42:09,607
Aren't you leaving?

663
00:42:09,711 --> 00:42:10,931
Right away.

664
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,420
Watching drama?

665
00:42:14,721 --> 00:42:15,761
Got it.

666
00:42:15,889 --> 00:42:17,369
Using the company's electricity, huh?

667
00:42:18,961 --> 00:42:20,400
Being single is so boring.

668
00:42:20,528 --> 00:42:21,748
I'll leave first.

669
00:42:21,896 --> 00:42:23,282
- Goodbye. - Bye.

670
00:42:24,085 --> 00:42:25,305
Go back early.

671
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,760
(I'm really happy today.)

672
00:42:27,841 --> 00:42:30,230
(I'm really happy today.)

673
00:42:38,137 --> 00:42:39,642
It's time to go home.

674
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,802
Boss, why are you here?

675
00:42:56,062 --> 00:42:57,282
Why didn't you go home?

676
00:42:59,361 --> 00:43:00,581
Working overtime.

677
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,981
Don't you have anything to tell me?

678
00:43:10,241 --> 00:43:11,322
But I do.

679
00:43:14,463 --> 00:43:16,962
How have you been considering the matter of my confession?
