1
00:01:35,584 --> 00:01:38,802
(My Boss)

2
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,503
(Episode 28)

3
00:01:42,584 --> 00:01:45,082
(Cheng Yao, are you seducing me?)

4
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,754
This bag is not strong enough.

5
00:01:52,948 --> 00:01:55,254
- Help me grab the slippers.   - Sure.

6
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,042
Go and take a break. I can clean up here.

7
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,153
- Are you sure you don't need my help?   - No.

8
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:04,322
Go.

9
00:02:40,588 --> 00:02:43,381
- Come in.   - Remember to sort the items we bought just now.

10
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:45,220
Don't worry. I'll be prepared.

11
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:47,619
What are you looking at?

12
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:49,569
It's nothing.

13
00:02:51,956 --> 00:02:54,514
Are you asking someone else to teach you how to date again?

14
00:02:54,594 --> 00:02:56,914
No way. Do I need this?

15
00:02:57,112 --> 00:02:58,882
- Really?   - Yes.

16
00:03:00,195 --> 00:03:01,415
All right.

17
00:03:03,728 --> 00:03:04,948
Don't...

18
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,362
Team-building plan?

19
00:03:07,884 --> 00:03:09,323
Why are you keeping this a secret?

20
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:10,596
It's nothing.

21
00:03:10,677 --> 00:03:12,617
I'm sending it to Zhu to confirm it.

22
00:03:13,274 --> 00:03:14,354
All right.

23
00:03:14,557 --> 00:03:16,934
We'll have dinner a bit later. I'm going to pack up.

24
00:03:17,073 --> 00:03:18,202
All right.

25
00:03:37,775 --> 00:03:39,135
(Private hot spring room.)

26
00:03:39,216 --> 00:03:40,882
(Cheng Yao and I must stay here.)

27
00:04:17,768 --> 00:04:18,882
Zhu.

28
00:04:19,494 --> 00:04:20,962
I've seen the plan. There's no problem with it.

29
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,713
However, I want to add a game rule

30
00:04:22,832 --> 00:04:24,442
to our team-building event.

31
00:04:56,432 --> 00:04:57,652
Cheng Yao.

32
00:05:01,228 --> 00:05:02,562
What am I thinking?

33
00:05:02,744 --> 00:05:05,543
(Travel is the best way to increase the bond.)

34
00:05:05,673 --> 00:05:09,953
(In such a beautiful place, with the sunset as the backdrop,)

35
00:05:10,056 --> 00:05:12,311
(the atmosphere immediately becomes romantic.)

36
00:05:12,392 --> 00:05:15,682
(Then, get some sweet and delicious alcohol.)

37
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:17,482
(When the two of you look at each other...)

38
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:27,804
Yao Yao, we will go out tonight...

39
00:05:28,514 --> 00:05:29,734
What is it?

40
00:05:30,753 --> 00:05:31,973
What are you hiding?

41
00:05:32,097 --> 00:05:33,317
It's nothing.

42
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:34,859
Are you sure?

43
00:05:36,932 --> 00:05:38,042
All right.

44
00:05:48,274 --> 00:05:49,494
It looks nice.

45
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:51,840
Are you going to wear it for me?

46
00:05:52,233 --> 00:05:53,453
I'm free now.

47
00:05:54,136 --> 00:05:57,602
- No. Get out.   - I'm not busy right now.

48
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,620
It's so embarrassing.

49
00:06:20,594 --> 00:06:22,303
The scenery is so beautiful.

50
00:06:25,255 --> 00:06:26,802
The air is fresh.

51
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:28,651
A place chosen by the boss is different indeed.

52
00:06:28,732 --> 00:06:30,333
Why didn't I see Lawyer Wu?

53
00:06:30,427 --> 00:06:33,406
He said he would be here tonight with a special guest so he won't join us.

54
00:06:33,487 --> 00:06:34,707
A surprise guest?

55
00:06:36,013 --> 00:06:37,740
Why did we get off here?

56
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:39,834
Where do you want to get off? The top of the mountain?

57
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:41,668
Why do I have a bad feeling?

58
00:06:41,973 --> 00:06:43,193
What? What do you mean?

59
00:06:43,442 --> 00:06:45,052
Come here. It's like this.

60
00:06:45,177 --> 00:06:48,549
The boss knows engaging in a lawsuit is not just mentally exhausting

61
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:51,619
but it is also a test of your stamina and willpower.

62
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,993
In order to train your willpower

63
00:06:54,074 --> 00:06:55,627
and your body,

64
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:58,522
we will be walking to the scenic area.

65
00:06:58,645 --> 00:06:59,875
Walk?

66
00:07:00,388 --> 00:07:01,448
Walk? I can't do it.

67
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:03,122
Can you walk in your shoes?

68
00:07:03,865 --> 00:07:06,971
I will send the hotel's location to all your phones.

69
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,896
But I want to remind all of you.

70
00:07:09,013 --> 00:07:11,263
The rooms are limited.

71
00:07:11,357 --> 00:07:13,082
They are first come, first served.

72
00:07:13,974 --> 00:07:16,604
The first to arrive will enjoy the hotel's

73
00:07:16,685 --> 00:07:18,722
premium private hot spring room!

74
00:07:19,924 --> 00:07:21,144
Just one room?

75
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:23,404
Team up with me.

76
00:07:23,615 --> 00:07:25,122
I'll make sure you get first place.

77
00:07:25,776 --> 00:07:27,125
Just the two of us?

78
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:28,801
Of course.

79
00:07:29,468 --> 00:07:30,908
What about the last place?

80
00:07:31,037 --> 00:07:32,707
Are we going to sleep outside?

81
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,353
Not really. We will still provide tents for everyone.

82
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:37,802
Tents?

83
00:07:38,464 --> 00:07:39,684
Galaxy room.

84
00:07:41,015 --> 00:07:42,802
No, let me ask one question.

85
00:07:43,091 --> 00:07:44,565
The location is good,

86
00:07:44,646 --> 00:07:46,322
but who arranged the schedule?

87
00:07:46,472 --> 00:07:47,713
Can someone admit it?

88
00:07:47,794 --> 00:07:49,107
I arranged it. What's wrong?

89
00:07:49,197 --> 00:07:50,762
It's well-arranged.

90
00:07:51,618 --> 00:07:53,449
It trains our willpower

91
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:56,633
and also trains our body.

92
00:07:56,857 --> 00:08:00,484
It allows us to put more passion into work.

93
00:08:01,943 --> 00:08:03,122
Great!

94
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:06,082
You must work regardless of your passion.

95
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,762
I feel like the boss doesn't love me anymore.

96
00:08:11,865 --> 00:08:13,322
I'm no longer his sun.

97
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,362
You can still be his star.

98
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,402
Everyone, form your teams, and let's go.

99
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:22,954
Cheng Yao.

100
00:08:23,146 --> 00:08:24,565
Have you finished writing the case analysis

101
00:08:24,646 --> 00:08:25,956
for the succession dispute case?

102
00:08:26,246 --> 00:08:27,722
Report the case to me on the way.

103
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,633
Lawyer Qian, we are on a trip.

104
00:08:29,721 --> 00:08:31,362
Please spare Cheng Yao.

105
00:08:31,813 --> 00:08:33,059
Traveling is one thing

106
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,162
but she still can't forget about work.

107
00:08:37,127 --> 00:08:39,122
Forget about work.

108
00:08:40,422 --> 00:08:42,162
Baby, I did my best.

109
00:08:44,354 --> 00:08:46,653
Actually, I feel sorry for you.

110
00:08:47,031 --> 00:08:48,791
But when I remember how badly he treats both of us,

111
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,834
I feel content for some reason.

112
00:08:50,945 --> 00:08:52,165
Do your best.

113
00:09:01,673 --> 00:09:02,893
Let me take a picture for you.

114
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:05,511
It's great.

115
00:09:05,623 --> 00:09:07,002
The five of us are in one group.

116
00:09:07,134 --> 00:09:08,364
It's destiny.

117
00:09:08,644 --> 00:09:10,794
Victory for Glory and Wealth!

118
00:09:12,608 --> 00:09:15,322
But Cheng Yao needs to report her work.

119
00:09:16,551 --> 00:09:17,784
Discussing a case?

120
00:09:17,865 --> 00:09:20,904
Boss, I don't want to miss any opportunity to learn from you.

121
00:09:21,013 --> 00:09:22,554
How can you leave me out of this discussion?

122
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:23,916
Let's discuss it together.

123
00:09:27,802 --> 00:09:29,766
I think I twisted my ankle! I can't walk!

124
00:09:29,847 --> 00:09:31,522
- Are you all right?   - You twisted your ankle?

125
00:09:34,216 --> 00:09:35,951
She hurt her ankle and can't walk.

126
00:09:36,032 --> 00:09:37,252
I... I will take care of her.

127
00:09:37,896 --> 00:09:39,865
Why don't you leave us here?

128
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,722
I can't make all of you sleep in tents because of me.

129
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:45,603
I will take care of her.

130
00:09:45,937 --> 00:09:49,802
We promised to never leave anyone behind.

131
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:54,974
- Bao Rui...   - But there are two of you so we are not abandoning you.

132
00:09:57,038 --> 00:09:59,271
Walk slowly. Don't force yourself.

133
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,778
Let's go, boss.

134
00:10:03,183 --> 00:10:04,980
- We are going ahead.   - Let them know who's number one.

135
00:10:05,061 --> 00:10:06,281
Rest well.

136
00:10:09,665 --> 00:10:10,744
This leg...

137
00:10:10,941 --> 00:10:13,766
- You reacted so quickly.   - My act was amazing.

138
00:10:13,855 --> 00:10:15,480
- You couldn't respond on time.   - You acted well.

139
00:10:15,552 --> 00:10:18,402
We'll show them who's number one!

140
00:10:18,613 --> 00:10:20,863
Glory and Wealth! We are the strongest!

141
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:23,602
Premium hot spring, we are coming!

142
00:10:24,042 --> 00:10:25,802
I say "Number", you say "One".

143
00:10:25,882 --> 00:10:28,791
Number! Number!

144
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,430
Where are the "ones"?

145
00:10:35,081 --> 00:10:36,301
Oh no.

146
00:10:37,242 --> 00:10:38,462
I'm lost.

147
00:10:44,234 --> 00:10:45,454
So pretty.

148
00:10:45,715 --> 00:10:46,762
Yes.

149
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:51,497
Is that the famous wishing tree?

150
00:10:52,162 --> 00:10:53,472
I think so.

151
00:10:54,081 --> 00:10:55,991
Since we are already here, should we make a wish?

152
00:10:56,498 --> 00:10:58,058
We should hurry and find our way back.

153
00:10:58,162 --> 00:10:59,991
But I want to make a wish.

154
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,322
If you wish for a promotion and a raise,

155
00:11:04,402 --> 00:11:05,521
you can just ask me for it.

156
00:11:05,601 --> 00:11:07,642
I don't mean that.

157
00:11:07,761 --> 00:11:08,981
Close your eyes.

158
00:11:26,418 --> 00:11:28,848
Yao Yao, I think it's raining.

159
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:32,882
I didn't bring an umbrella. What should we do?

160
00:11:36,522 --> 00:11:38,602
- Let's go and hide under the pavilion.   - Let's go.

161
00:12:18,858 --> 00:12:20,808
The rain is so heavy.

162
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,262
- Do you feel cold?   - No.

163
00:12:41,482 --> 00:12:42,842
It's so pretty.

164
00:12:43,581 --> 00:12:46,391
How do we go there when it's raining so heavily?

165
00:12:46,522 --> 00:12:48,192
Will we not get first place?

166
00:12:48,307 --> 00:12:50,552
No. I know a shortcut.

167
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,562
You are quite amazing.

168
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:24,101
You actually found such an isolated path.

169
00:13:25,282 --> 00:13:27,282
We will surely get first place.

170
00:13:27,378 --> 00:13:29,688
Premium hot spring... What's the room called?

171
00:13:30,362 --> 00:13:32,031
- What room?   - I don't know.

172
00:13:35,921 --> 00:13:37,552
There's so much mud.

173
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:39,238
Your shoes...

174
00:13:39,851 --> 00:13:41,071
Why don't I carry you on my back?

175
00:13:41,204 --> 00:13:43,033
Won't you walk slower if you carry me?

176
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,298
My legs are long. I can walk fast.

177
00:13:45,394 --> 00:13:46,442
Come on.

178
00:13:46,841 --> 00:13:47,922
Come.

179
00:13:51,362 --> 00:13:52,402
Let's go.

180
00:13:52,561 --> 00:13:53,781
Let's go.

181
00:13:55,178 --> 00:13:56,465
Am I easy to carry?

182
00:13:58,886 --> 00:14:01,842
Yao Yao, you are choking me.

183
00:14:02,173 --> 00:14:03,922
I won't drop you.

184
00:14:08,361 --> 00:14:10,245
The pictures you took are so ugly!

185
00:14:10,326 --> 00:14:12,082
- Has your leg recovered?  - No.

186
00:14:12,545 --> 00:14:14,026
- Which leg?   - This one.

187
00:14:14,107 --> 00:14:15,327
Yes. This one.

188
00:14:16,841 --> 00:14:17,962
Boss.

189
00:14:18,227 --> 00:14:19,682
- Lawyer Qian.   - Are you all right?

190
00:14:19,801 --> 00:14:20,962
Cheng Yao.

191
00:14:22,242 --> 00:14:23,462
Both of you...

192
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,479
Both of you actually

193
00:14:27,642 --> 00:14:28,862
discussed the case behind my back?

194
00:14:30,506 --> 00:14:31,736
Cheng Yao, I hate you.

195
00:14:32,961 --> 00:14:35,232
I missed another opportunity to learn from our boss again.

196
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,552
Since you love to work so much,

197
00:14:37,681 --> 00:14:39,162
I will give you more cases.

198
00:14:40,242 --> 00:14:43,202
No need. Actually, my workload is saturated.

199
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:46,322
- Your leg...   - Everyone, gather around.

200
00:14:47,402 --> 00:14:50,482
I'm sure all of you care about the result.

201
00:14:50,737 --> 00:14:52,198
Let me

202
00:14:52,841 --> 00:14:55,352
announce the last place.

203
00:14:57,561 --> 00:14:59,762
It's Cheng Yao and Lawyer Qian.

204
00:14:59,961 --> 00:15:02,002
Sorry, both of you need to sleep in a tent.

205
00:15:02,091 --> 00:15:03,311
Sleep in a tent?

206
00:15:03,482 --> 00:15:05,871
Today's champion...

207
00:15:06,728 --> 00:15:10,162
- It's...   - I say "Number", you say...

208
00:15:10,311 --> 00:15:11,602
Bao Rui!

209
00:15:12,362 --> 00:15:14,322
Who's staying in the premium hot spring room?

210
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:16,162
Who's staying in the premium hot spring room?

211
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:17,709
Who's staying in a tent...

212
00:15:26,418 --> 00:15:27,479
Don't be upset.

213
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,522
Didn't we have fun when we walked here?

214
00:15:30,603 --> 00:15:33,561
Bao Rui will enjoy a hot spring all to himself.

215
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:36,375
Due to the hotel's design, a hot spring is shared by two rooms.

216
00:15:36,456 --> 00:15:38,762
(Thankfully, staying in a tent is my plan B.)

217
00:15:38,843 --> 00:15:40,282
He will have two rooms.

218
00:15:40,363 --> 00:15:41,682
I'm so envious.

219
00:15:41,785 --> 00:15:44,156
Zhu, since I'm the champion,

220
00:15:44,237 --> 00:15:45,391
do I have the right

221
00:15:45,482 --> 00:15:48,402
to give the other room as a giveaway

222
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,834
to another colleague?

223
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,402
Of course, the rule allows for that.

224
00:15:53,234 --> 00:15:54,953
I want to invite...

225
00:15:55,073 --> 00:15:56,293
I like to be alone.

226
00:15:56,626 --> 00:15:59,002
- Congratulations, Yu Fei!   - I snore.

227
00:15:59,122 --> 00:16:00,562
Congratulations, Tan Ying!

228
00:16:00,658 --> 00:16:01,878
I sleepwalk.

229
00:16:03,216 --> 00:16:05,017
Everyone has a chance now!

230
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:06,847
Let me see...

231
00:16:09,941 --> 00:16:11,450
(Don't pick me.)

232
00:16:14,913 --> 00:16:16,080
Cheng Yao, save me.

233
00:16:16,161 --> 00:16:18,060
Now is not about staying with me or not.

234
00:16:18,289 --> 00:16:19,520
I'm embarrassed.

235
00:16:20,877 --> 00:16:22,163
Help me out.

236
00:16:22,244 --> 00:16:24,042
It's too humiliating to be rejected three times.

237
00:16:30,642 --> 00:16:31,862
Bao, I...

238
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,762
If you help me, you can do my case for next month.

239
00:16:36,072 --> 00:16:37,762
I will give you my cases in the next two months.

240
00:16:37,921 --> 00:16:39,802
I'll also send a month's worth of information. How's that?

241
00:16:40,647 --> 00:16:41,867
How's that?

242
00:16:46,054 --> 00:16:48,765
(Cheng Yao, you better reject him immediately.)

243
00:16:51,522 --> 00:16:52,751
All right.

244
00:16:53,162 --> 00:16:54,162
Congratulations to Cheng Yao

245
00:16:54,242 --> 00:16:56,362
for getting the premium hot spring room!

246
00:16:57,979 --> 00:17:00,042
Isn't he doing a giveaway? It's so awkward.

247
00:17:00,161 --> 00:17:02,232
Don't be angry.

248
00:17:02,408 --> 00:17:03,967
You are used to staying in premium hotels.

249
00:17:04,048 --> 00:17:05,383
What's wrong with staying in a tent once?

250
00:17:05,464 --> 00:17:07,644
Do you think I'm angry because I'm staying in a tent?

251
00:17:07,821 --> 00:17:09,642
You couldn't resist Bao Rui's temptation

252
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,122
and he successfully bribed you with two cases.

253
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,406
Of course, not. Bao Rui...

254
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,305
He said that even though he knew how important the cases were.

255
00:17:16,386 --> 00:17:17,896
He was really feeling embarrassed.

256
00:17:18,842 --> 00:17:20,633
You care for him a lot.

257
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,563
When did both of you get so close?

258
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,040
He invited you too.

259
00:17:24,121 --> 00:17:25,341
Didn't you reject him as well?

260
00:17:26,682 --> 00:17:28,232
Don't be jealous.

261
00:17:28,962 --> 00:17:30,202
Am I jealous of him?

262
00:17:30,321 --> 00:17:33,030
I just wanted to protect Bao Rui's dignity just now.

263
00:17:33,361 --> 00:17:34,610
I'm not really going to stay with him.

264
00:17:34,691 --> 00:17:36,041
See who am I with now?

265
00:17:37,401 --> 00:17:38,621
Let's sit down for a while.

266
00:17:45,726 --> 00:17:46,946
What's that?

267
00:17:48,121 --> 00:17:49,341
Verbenas.

268
00:18:38,478 --> 00:18:40,162
Hello? Zhu.

269
00:18:41,707 --> 00:18:43,282
All right. I'm coming immediately.

270
00:18:44,778 --> 00:18:46,402
Zhu says dinner will begin soon.

271
00:18:48,178 --> 00:18:49,527
I will fire her one day.

272
00:18:51,777 --> 00:18:52,922
Let's go.

273
00:18:53,524 --> 00:18:54,922
Whatever.

274
00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:07,426
This liquor is refreshing when you pair it with meals.

275
00:19:08,596 --> 00:19:09,995
- What?   - This.

276
00:19:10,113 --> 00:19:11,233
Liquor?

277
00:19:11,314 --> 00:19:12,534
Let me try it.

278
00:19:15,394 --> 00:19:17,402
Indeed. It's sweet and sour.

279
00:19:18,514 --> 00:19:20,434
Cheng Yao, I saved you a seat. Come here.

280
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:22,282
- Another glass?   - Get lost.

281
00:19:25,187 --> 00:19:26,322
Come here.

282
00:19:28,202 --> 00:19:29,522
Why are you so late?

283
00:19:30,361 --> 00:19:31,362
Boss.

284
00:19:31,561 --> 00:19:33,481
How's the tent?

285
00:19:33,561 --> 00:19:34,882
Do you feel aggrieved staying there?

286
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,230
Why don't we swap places?

287
00:19:36,762 --> 00:19:38,842
Swap... It's fine with me.

288
00:19:38,922 --> 00:19:40,942
I'm not worried about losing the room.

289
00:19:41,042 --> 00:19:42,362
In other words...

290
00:19:42,561 --> 00:19:44,122
Let's change a topic.

291
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:46,415
The liquor is nice. Let me pour it for you.

292
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:49,177
Everyone is here. Let me introduce her.

293
00:19:49,258 --> 00:19:50,362
She is Cheng Xi.

294
00:19:50,442 --> 00:19:51,761
An expert in trust property.

295
00:19:51,841 --> 00:19:54,242
She is now dealing with some legal aid cases.

296
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:56,079
Hello, everyone.

297
00:19:59,619 --> 00:20:02,506
Lawyer Cheng, were you working at Dewei & Co previously?

298
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:10,384
Yes. I used to work at Dewei & Co.

299
00:20:12,313 --> 00:20:14,505
Everyone, sit. Cheng Xi, let's sit as well.

300
00:20:21,801 --> 00:20:24,321
Lawyer Cheng, I've seen your court trial transcripts.

301
00:20:24,446 --> 00:20:26,562
You are really amazing in trust property cases.

302
00:20:26,841 --> 00:20:28,352
I thought you'd lose in a few cases

303
00:20:28,433 --> 00:20:29,663
but you won them all.

304
00:20:29,801 --> 00:20:31,602
What do you mean?

305
00:20:31,821 --> 00:20:33,442
That only proves that the cases were difficult.

306
00:20:33,522 --> 00:20:35,079
You will lose if you are the lawyer.

307
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,519
- What about you?   - I won't accept it.

308
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,640
Nice.

309
00:20:37,753 --> 00:20:40,065
I will hand it over to the expert, Cheng Xi.

310
00:20:40,161 --> 00:20:43,642
That is why Cheng Xi is the ace in trust property.

311
00:20:43,722 --> 00:20:45,662
She can even win when the odds are against her.

312
00:20:46,377 --> 00:20:47,457
No.

313
00:20:47,561 --> 00:20:49,721
They are all glories of the past.

314
00:20:49,801 --> 00:20:52,872
I just want to do my legal aid cases well now.

315
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:56,962
Anyway, I'm sure all of you can see Cheng Xi's capability.

316
00:20:57,706 --> 00:21:01,391
I've always wanted to invite Cheng Xi to join Junheng & Co

317
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:03,611
but she might not have enough trust in me.

318
00:21:03,746 --> 00:21:05,426
Aren't you all impressed by her?

319
00:21:05,507 --> 00:21:08,536
Help me persuade her to join Junheng & Co soon.

320
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:12,042
To be honest,

321
00:21:12,383 --> 00:21:15,122
Lawyer Wu is the best in the legal world when it comes to socializing.

322
00:21:15,202 --> 00:21:17,952
With Lawyer Wu around, we don't have to be worried about a lack of cases.

323
00:21:18,121 --> 00:21:20,915
Although he isn't serious sometimes,

324
00:21:20,996 --> 00:21:23,082
he is reliable when it comes to work.

325
00:21:23,188 --> 00:21:24,649
He gives a sense of security. Joining won't hurt.

326
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:28,522
Besides, Lawyer Wu's win rate is high.

327
00:21:29,305 --> 00:21:30,922
I'll give you bonuses later.

328
00:21:33,899 --> 00:21:34,938
Senior,

329
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:36,529
Junheng & Co welcomes you at any time.

330
00:21:45,723 --> 00:21:47,834
I'm grateful for everyone's recognition.

331
00:21:47,986 --> 00:21:49,656
If I have an opportunity in the future,

332
00:21:49,962 --> 00:21:51,642
I will join Junheng & Co in the future.

333
00:21:55,963 --> 00:21:57,673
All right. Let's eat.

334
00:21:59,963 --> 00:22:01,472
I can do it myself.

335
00:22:07,475 --> 00:22:09,122
Don't do it if you don't know how.

336
00:22:12,939 --> 00:22:14,018
Is it supposed to be there?

337
00:22:14,129 --> 00:22:17,040
Zhu, do we have any plans after the meal?

338
00:22:17,234 --> 00:22:19,214
No. You can do anything you want.

339
00:22:19,908 --> 00:22:21,362
I want to go to the night market.

340
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:23,802
- I want to go too.   - I'm going as well.

341
00:22:24,161 --> 00:22:26,282
- Let's go together.   - Sure.

342
00:22:33,356 --> 00:22:34,356
Cheng Yao.

343
00:22:34,469 --> 00:22:36,162
The strawberry ice cream in front is delicious.

344
00:22:36,242 --> 00:22:37,562
- Do you want it?   - Yes.

345
00:22:38,002 --> 00:22:39,222
Buy it for everyone.

346
00:22:41,081 --> 00:22:43,521
Lawyer Qian says he is buying everyone ice cream!

347
00:22:43,632 --> 00:22:46,102
Thank you, Lawyer Qian!

348
00:22:47,854 --> 00:22:49,284
We don't need to pay for it anymore.

349
00:22:51,097 --> 00:22:52,602
Thank you.

350
00:23:00,161 --> 00:23:01,722
I also want strawberry flavor.

351
00:23:02,025 --> 00:23:04,162
- Thank you.   - Why is a man like you eating strawberry ice cream?

352
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:05,922
- Boss, strawberry flavor.   - I'm not eating.

353
00:23:06,003 --> 00:23:07,223
I'll eat it myself, then.

354
00:23:10,762 --> 00:23:11,982
Let's go.

355
00:23:13,121 --> 00:23:14,962
What is this? Cotton candy?

356
00:23:15,121 --> 00:23:16,243
- Do you want it?   - Yes.

357
00:23:16,324 --> 00:23:18,045
Lawyer Qian is buying everyone cotton candy!

358
00:23:18,202 --> 00:23:19,722
Thank you, Lawyer Qian.

359
00:23:19,803 --> 00:23:21,023
Boss, I want two.

360
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,021
This is so cute.

361
00:23:26,003 --> 00:23:27,322
Thank you.

362
00:23:27,616 --> 00:23:29,882
This is wrinkled. It looks like both of you.

363
00:23:30,601 --> 00:23:31,912
Give me a bunny.

364
00:23:32,002 --> 00:23:33,561
Why is a man buying a bunny?

365
00:23:33,641 --> 00:23:35,241
Give me a big bunny.

366
00:23:35,321 --> 00:23:37,281
Look at mine. It has turned yellow.

367
00:23:37,376 --> 00:23:39,006
Mine no longer has a chin.

368
00:23:42,161 --> 00:23:44,142
- So funny.   - So sweet.

369
00:23:44,475 --> 00:23:45,695
What is this?

370
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:52,842
Let's go.

371
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:04,922
What is this?

372
00:24:05,996 --> 00:24:07,642
Lawyer Qian is buying everyone Tanghulu!

373
00:24:08,087 --> 00:24:09,831
Thank you for being so generous, Lawyer Qian!

374
00:24:09,912 --> 00:24:11,768
He's so generous that I can't bring myself to eat it.

375
00:24:11,851 --> 00:24:13,722
- I can eat.   - Can you eat?

376
00:24:14,002 --> 00:24:15,222
Then...

377
00:24:16,762 --> 00:24:18,202
- Eat this.   - No. This is...

378
00:24:18,282 --> 00:24:20,311
- One is missing.   - You said you can eat them.

379
00:24:20,545 --> 00:24:21,765
The tall guy will pay.

380
00:24:39,801 --> 00:24:41,762
- You can walk on your own.   - All right.

381
00:25:11,666 --> 00:25:13,842
How do I know I like to eat these?

382
00:25:14,745 --> 00:25:17,290
Ice cream, cotton candy, and Tanghulu.

383
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:19,082
You looked at them longer than others.

384
00:25:19,282 --> 00:25:20,882
I was also looking at other things.

385
00:25:21,002 --> 00:25:23,662
How do you know whether I like something or not?

386
00:25:23,962 --> 00:25:26,442
I know how to differentiate your gaze.

387
00:25:26,841 --> 00:25:28,071
I knew you wanted to eat them.

388
00:25:28,161 --> 00:25:29,381
My gaze?

389
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:32,962
That's the gaze you have when you are looking at me.

390
00:25:33,042 --> 00:25:34,271
So, I know.

391
00:25:34,881 --> 00:25:36,761
There's no choice. Everyone was around.

392
00:25:36,841 --> 00:25:38,241
I couldn't just buy them for you alone

393
00:25:38,321 --> 00:25:40,241
so I bought them for everyone.

394
00:25:40,321 --> 00:25:41,551
Why are you so nice?

395
00:25:42,406 --> 00:25:44,922
We are still so close together when our colleagues are in front.

396
00:25:45,104 --> 00:25:46,333
Isn't it very dangerous?

397
00:25:47,762 --> 00:25:48,982
Dangerous?

398
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,188
I can do something even more dangerous.

399
00:25:54,171 --> 00:25:55,391
Where are we going?

400
00:26:08,481 --> 00:26:09,701
Where are they?

401
00:26:15,275 --> 00:26:16,495
Cheng Yao!

402
00:26:17,722 --> 00:26:18,942
Cheng Yao!

403
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,120
Yu Fei!

404
00:26:24,364 --> 00:26:25,762
I lost Yu Fei too.

405
00:26:28,722 --> 00:26:30,031
I think I'm lost.

406
00:26:31,492 --> 00:26:33,202
Oh no, I'm lost again.

407
00:26:35,216 --> 00:26:36,487
Yu Fei!

408
00:26:39,922 --> 00:26:42,002
- Did he catch up to us?   - No.

409
00:26:42,442 --> 00:26:44,842
I thought we would be happier if we had a team-building event.

410
00:26:45,018 --> 00:26:46,762
Right now, the time we can spend together

411
00:26:46,843 --> 00:26:48,324
is less than when we are working.

412
00:26:48,405 --> 00:26:49,760
Fine. Let's find somewhere nearer

413
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:51,282
with just the two of us when we go back

414
00:26:51,363 --> 00:26:52,805
- to make up for this trip, all right?   - No.

415
00:26:52,886 --> 00:26:54,322
I want to make up for it now.

416
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:56,006
Cheng Yao!

417
00:26:57,564 --> 00:26:59,298
I will fire him sooner or later.

418
00:27:01,231 --> 00:27:02,522
Cheng Yao!

419
00:27:05,451 --> 00:27:06,922
Why is there a call at this time?

420
00:27:07,635 --> 00:27:09,474
- I have to answer this.   - Go and answer it.

421
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:10,781
Help me deal with him.

422
00:27:12,281 --> 00:27:13,671
Cheng Yao!

423
00:27:13,994 --> 00:27:15,904
Bao, are you looking for me?

424
00:27:17,682 --> 00:27:19,962
Cheng Yao, you scared me. I thought you were lost.

425
00:27:20,102 --> 00:27:21,812
Later, I realized I was lost too.

426
00:27:21,962 --> 00:27:23,162
I found a really nice bar.

427
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:24,442
Let's go take a look.

428
00:27:24,522 --> 00:27:26,922
The drinks are nice and the atmosphere is great.

429
00:27:27,002 --> 00:27:30,821
It is suitable for urban youths like us to relax.

430
00:27:35,147 --> 00:27:37,082
Junheng & Co's atmosphere is nice.

431
00:27:37,552 --> 00:27:40,222
My junior has become an amazing lawyer as well.

432
00:27:40,762 --> 00:27:42,362
Stop teasing me.

433
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:44,841
I'm incapable compared to you.

434
00:27:45,601 --> 00:27:48,041
You used to be the goddess for every guy in our batch.

435
00:27:48,121 --> 00:27:49,511
What goddess?

436
00:27:50,321 --> 00:27:52,791
However, I was ambitious back then.

437
00:27:53,025 --> 00:27:54,306
I wanted to become

438
00:27:54,434 --> 00:27:56,303
the most famous trust lawyer in the industry.

439
00:27:58,002 --> 00:27:59,751
Later, when I became famous,

440
00:27:59,914 --> 00:28:02,134
I couldn't survive in the industry at all.

441
00:28:02,769 --> 00:28:04,170
When I went for an interview,

442
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:05,882
the boss told me

443
00:28:06,081 --> 00:28:07,682
to become a behind-the-scenes lawyer

444
00:28:07,762 --> 00:28:08,962
and not appear in public.

445
00:28:09,042 --> 00:28:11,462
Back then, I was only thinking about one thing.

446
00:28:11,722 --> 00:28:13,321
I could no longer become a lawyer anymore.

447
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:14,522
Cheng Xi.

448
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:17,541
Listen well.

449
00:28:17,683 --> 00:28:20,073
You are the best trust lawyer to me.

450
00:28:20,729 --> 00:28:23,202
Don't be trapped by the past. It's unnecessary.

451
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:25,512
Didn't everyone say it during dinner?

452
00:28:25,593 --> 00:28:28,344
What they remembered was your victories.

453
00:28:29,186 --> 00:28:31,535
Besides, you are successful as a legal aid lawyer.

454
00:28:31,923 --> 00:28:33,087
You've helped many families with difficulties

455
00:28:33,168 --> 00:28:34,888
without asking for anything in return.

456
00:28:35,753 --> 00:28:37,193
I'm sure you feel happy

457
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:38,632
and a sense of achievement.

458
00:28:40,794 --> 00:28:42,355
They came to me,

459
00:28:42,442 --> 00:28:44,482
respected me, and trusted me.

460
00:28:44,703 --> 00:28:46,362
It made me feel that I was worthy.

461
00:28:46,483 --> 00:28:49,202
I can still become a lawyer and help them do many things.

462
00:28:49,321 --> 00:28:51,831
Of course. You can do many things.

463
00:28:52,346 --> 00:28:53,762
Besides, you will forever

464
00:28:53,922 --> 00:28:55,482
be the brightest star in my heart.

465
00:29:04,879 --> 00:29:06,099
Thank you.

466
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:10,967
Doing this suddenly makes me feel embarrassed.

467
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:37,170
Thank you.

468
00:29:37,266 --> 00:29:39,465
The three of us will buy you drinks to comfort you.

469
00:29:39,561 --> 00:29:41,192
Comfort me? Why?

470
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:44,158
We want to comfort you for being tortured by the boss.

471
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:45,922
You've suffered.

472
00:29:46,008 --> 00:29:47,882
It's not that the three of us are standing by and watching

473
00:29:47,963 --> 00:29:50,275
- but we were really...   - We couldn't help at all

474
00:29:50,377 --> 00:29:51,938
and we would get involved as well.

475
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:54,122
So, to show you our love as your colleagues,

476
00:29:54,202 --> 00:29:55,642
we will buy you drinks tonight.

477
00:29:55,722 --> 00:29:56,942
Let's get drunk.

478
00:29:57,174 --> 00:29:59,202
Cheng Yao, we are in the same boat.

479
00:29:59,321 --> 00:30:01,801
Even if you badmouth Lawyer Qian, we will help you keep it a secret.

480
00:30:01,923 --> 00:30:04,351
Bao Rui did a lot of research to find this bar.

481
00:30:04,505 --> 00:30:06,564
It's quiet and the drinks are good.

482
00:30:06,957 --> 00:30:08,177
Come on!

483
00:30:08,336 --> 00:30:09,762
- Come.   - Let's drink!

484
00:30:10,096 --> 00:30:12,502
- Are we just drinking?   - Order some food, then.

485
00:30:13,282 --> 00:30:14,321
Are we playing games?

486
00:30:14,401 --> 00:30:15,482
Truth or dare.

487
00:30:15,568 --> 00:30:18,295
Let's not do that. If Lawyer Qian comes, we need to recite the law again.

488
00:30:18,376 --> 00:30:21,682
- It's too risky.   - You are right. Just truth without dare, all right?

489
00:30:21,763 --> 00:30:23,242
Tell the truth if you get picked.

490
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,671
If you won't say it, take a drink.

491
00:30:24,762 --> 00:30:26,162
- Sure.   - Sure. Come on.

492
00:30:26,273 --> 00:30:27,602
- Is it fine?   - Sure.

493
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,762
Cheng Yao! Let me ask first!

494
00:30:39,482 --> 00:30:42,498
The person who sent you roses.

495
00:30:42,685 --> 00:30:44,021
- Are you two a couple now?   - How do you know him?

496
00:30:44,102 --> 00:30:45,800
- Is he a lawyer?   - How did you two become a couple?

497
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:49,602
I'll drink.

498
00:30:55,439 --> 00:30:57,562
Baby, you are tight-lipped.

499
00:30:58,997 --> 00:31:00,200
- All right.   - Again.

500
00:31:00,281 --> 00:31:01,642
All right. Let's continue.

501
00:31:10,895 --> 00:31:12,446
Bao Rui, it's your turn.

502
00:31:13,682 --> 00:31:14,902
Come at me.

503
00:31:16,682 --> 00:31:20,484
- When was your first love?   - When I was three years old.

504
00:31:20,565 --> 00:31:21,578
You had a girlfriend when you were three years old?

505
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:24,223
- It was a one-sided love.   - When you are three years old?

506
00:31:24,304 --> 00:31:25,534
The Powerpuff Girls.

507
00:31:26,501 --> 00:31:29,713
I like that character from Balala the Fairies.

508
00:31:31,762 --> 00:31:32,807
I'll drink.

509
00:31:32,888 --> 00:31:34,562
Why are you drinking?

510
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,831
Bao Rui, keep drinking.

511
00:32:01,081 --> 00:32:02,521
I can't drink anymore.

512
00:32:02,648 --> 00:32:04,402
- Hurry up.   - Just ask me questions.

513
00:32:05,401 --> 00:32:06,802
I'll ask you a question.

514
00:32:08,458 --> 00:32:11,001
Why didn't you like Balala the Fairies when you were three years old?

515
00:32:11,106 --> 00:32:13,541
I was 16 years old when Balala the Fairies was airing.

516
00:32:14,176 --> 00:32:15,396
Which year were you born in?

517
00:32:15,995 --> 00:32:17,215
I'll drink.

518
00:32:18,863 --> 00:32:20,083
I'm going to the toilet.

519
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:22,174
Fine. Let me ask you another question.

520
00:32:22,255 --> 00:32:24,922
Why didn't you like Balala the Fairies when you were 16?

521
00:32:25,002 --> 00:32:28,281
When I was 16, Balala the Fairies had just aired, right?

522
00:32:28,439 --> 00:32:30,362
Balala the Fairies is...

523
00:33:09,786 --> 00:33:11,577
Yao Yao, where are you?

524
00:33:12,361 --> 00:33:14,192
I'm in your heart.

525
00:33:14,643 --> 00:33:15,863
Did you drink?

526
00:33:16,738 --> 00:33:17,958
Did you really drink?

527
00:33:18,722 --> 00:33:19,761
Who's beside you?

528
00:33:19,841 --> 00:33:21,751
I'm not drunk. I'm with Bao...

529
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,580
Where's Bao Rui?

530
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,781
A call.

531
00:33:44,325 --> 00:33:45,343
Boss.

532
00:33:45,424 --> 00:33:47,185
(Bao Rui, is Cheng Yao beside you?)

533
00:33:47,305 --> 00:33:48,525
Yes. She's drinking...

534
00:33:49,481 --> 00:33:52,121
- Where's Cheng Yao?   - Didn't she say she was going to the toilet?

535
00:33:52,202 --> 00:33:53,562
Cheng Yao went to the toilet.

536
00:33:53,643 --> 00:33:54,842
It has been half an hour.

537
00:33:54,923 --> 00:33:56,333
Yes. She's in the toilet for half an hour.

538
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,381
How long?

539
00:33:59,506 --> 00:34:00,726
(More than half an hour.)

540
00:34:05,856 --> 00:34:08,082
Oh no, Cheng Yao got lost again.

541
00:34:08,441 --> 00:34:10,111
- Cheng Yao!   - Cheng Yao!

542
00:34:21,427 --> 00:34:23,322
- Where is she?   - Cheng Yao!

543
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:25,073
So pretty.

544
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:27,722
- Where should we go find her?   - Cheng Yao!

545
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,050
- Cheng Yao!   - We are not doing dares!

546
00:34:30,298 --> 00:34:31,518
Cheng Yao!

547
00:34:31,697 --> 00:34:32,917
Yao Yao!

548
00:34:34,226 --> 00:34:35,322
Yao Yao!

549
00:34:37,315 --> 00:34:38,442
Yao Yao!

550
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,562
What are you doing?

551
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:45,344
Yao Yao, do you know how long I've been looking for you?

552
00:34:45,443 --> 00:34:46,712
Why did you drink so much?

553
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,242
You are finally here.

554
00:35:00,034 --> 00:35:01,624
I want to kiss you.

555
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,879
I want my boyfriend to kiss me.

556
00:35:10,523 --> 00:35:13,602
No, she made a mistake.

557
00:35:13,713 --> 00:35:15,162
She mistook me for her boyfriend.

558
00:35:15,692 --> 00:35:16,973
We are just in an employer-employee relationship.

559
00:35:17,054 --> 00:35:18,842
Qian Heng, I like you!

560
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:31,202
All right.

561
00:35:31,616 --> 00:35:33,362
What you see is the truth.

562
00:35:33,736 --> 00:35:35,007
I am in a relationship with Cheng Yao.

563
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:38,882
However, I don't want anyone else to know about this

564
00:35:38,963 --> 00:35:40,432
besides the three of you.

565
00:35:40,913 --> 00:35:42,143
Close your eyes and turn around.

566
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:46,831
I'm talking about them. Not you.

567
00:35:54,229 --> 00:35:55,449
Let's go.

568
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,842
I can't stand anymore.

569
00:36:08,081 --> 00:36:10,922
Bao Rui, turn around and see if they are gone.

570
00:36:11,147 --> 00:36:12,202
What?

571
00:36:12,433 --> 00:36:14,042
See if they are gone.

572
00:36:14,322 --> 00:36:15,542
Who is gone?

573
00:36:19,347 --> 00:36:20,882
They are gone.

574
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,162
Let's go. We should leave as well.

575
00:36:24,281 --> 00:36:25,642
Hold me.

576
00:36:26,161 --> 00:36:27,522
My legs are giving out.

577
00:36:33,281 --> 00:36:34,501
Be careful.

578
00:36:36,842 --> 00:36:38,802
Wait for me.

579
00:36:41,107 --> 00:36:42,242
Here.

580
00:36:42,627 --> 00:36:43,833
Sit here.

581
00:36:44,442 --> 00:36:45,562
Yes.

582
00:36:49,761 --> 00:36:50,981
I want a kiss.

583
00:36:53,735 --> 00:36:55,482
All right. You drank a lot.

584
00:36:55,665 --> 00:36:57,616
Go to sleep, all right? Good girl.

585
00:36:57,731 --> 00:36:59,121
Move upwards.

586
00:37:26,442 --> 00:37:27,662
Wait for me.

587
00:37:47,543 --> 00:37:48,763
Yao Yao,

588
00:37:49,322 --> 00:37:50,842
I put a cup of tea over there.

589
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:52,402
Remember to drink it when you wake up.

590
00:37:57,852 --> 00:37:59,072
See you tomorrow.

591
00:38:15,755 --> 00:38:16,975
(I miss you.)

592
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:32,922
(Good night.)

593
00:39:04,251 --> 00:39:06,390
- Why are you here?   - You miss me.

594
00:39:08,498 --> 00:39:09,718
I miss you too.

595
00:39:15,755 --> 00:39:17,122
I miss you too.

596
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:43,779
You're asleep?

597
00:41:16,395 --> 00:41:17,522
Yao Yao.

598
00:41:18,585 --> 00:41:20,322
- Good morning.   - Where did you get them?

599
00:41:20,482 --> 00:41:21,521
I picked them.

600
00:41:21,601 --> 00:41:23,082
Did you pick wild flowers?

601
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:24,562
You don't like them? Forget it, then.

602
00:41:24,643 --> 00:41:25,962
I like them.

603
00:41:31,799 --> 00:41:34,900
Why did I sleep in your tent last night?

604
00:41:35,322 --> 00:41:36,871
You... You don't remember?

605
00:41:40,674 --> 00:41:41,802
Yao Yao,

606
00:41:42,201 --> 00:41:43,802
I've known you for so long

607
00:41:44,721 --> 00:41:47,182
but I didn't realize you were this kind of person.

608
00:41:47,481 --> 00:41:48,640
What kind of person?

609
00:41:48,721 --> 00:41:50,032
It's that kind of...

610
00:41:54,593 --> 00:41:55,993
All right. I won't tease you anymore.

611
00:41:56,145 --> 00:41:58,465
You kicked me to a corner last night

612
00:41:58,561 --> 00:41:59,911
and took my blanket.

613
00:42:03,058 --> 00:42:05,278
- That's all?   - What else do you want?

614
00:42:08,561 --> 00:42:09,871
I thought...

615
00:42:10,475 --> 00:42:11,695
What were you thinking?

616
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:13,891
What were you thinking? What is it?

617
00:42:14,002 --> 00:42:15,552
They are all awake. Let's go.

618
00:42:21,963 --> 00:42:23,513
The temperature has decreased last night.

619
00:42:23,731 --> 00:42:26,602
If you feel cold, take a hot shower

620
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,482
and rest for a while.

621
00:42:30,741 --> 00:42:31,882
Bye.

622
00:42:37,754 --> 00:42:39,042
The light is so bright.

623
00:42:39,868 --> 00:42:42,322
It hurts my eyes. I can't see a thing.

624
00:42:49,789 --> 00:42:51,922
Why are you here? Aren't you staying in the tent?

625
00:42:52,575 --> 00:42:53,884
Well, I...

626
00:42:54,194 --> 00:42:56,562
(Bao Rui, it's time for you to act.)

627
00:42:56,681 --> 00:42:59,282
(You must not let Lawyer Wu find out Lawyer Qian is dating Cheng Yao.)

628
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,839
(You are responsible for protecting the boss' love.)

629
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:04,162
Why are you here?

630
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,599
I asked Lawyer Qian to come here.

631
00:43:06,796 --> 00:43:09,609
I have something very important to discuss with Lawyer Qian.

632
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:14,080
You came here to discuss a case with him?

633
00:43:14,877 --> 00:43:16,097
It's not a case.

634
00:43:16,403 --> 00:43:17,623
It's something very important.

635
00:43:18,412 --> 00:43:19,632
It's about...

636
00:43:19,978 --> 00:43:21,887
It's about Cheng Xi's employment.

637
00:43:23,602 --> 00:43:24,822
Isn't it important?

638
00:43:26,665 --> 00:43:28,786
Bao Rui, you care too much.

639
00:43:28,882 --> 00:43:31,102
What does Cheng Xi's employment have to do with you?

640
00:43:32,932 --> 00:43:34,442
She won't come, right?

641
00:43:34,702 --> 00:43:37,442
I have a new idea that will let her join Junheng & Co quickly.

642
00:43:39,099 --> 00:43:40,642
Come and speak with me in my room.

643
00:43:40,852 --> 00:43:42,442
The idea isn't mature actually.

644
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:43,850
It's immature.

645
00:43:43,931 --> 00:43:45,922
No, Lawyer Wu. It's immature.
