1
00:01:35,612 --> 00:01:38,882
(My Boss)

2
00:01:40,224 --> 00:01:43,036
(Episode 18: Live streaming doesn't fit my style.)

3
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:45,368
(Cheng Yao wants me to do a live stream?)

4
00:01:45,471 --> 00:01:47,922
(I guess I can do it reluctantly.)

5
00:02:06,443 --> 00:02:08,482
Boss, sorry for keeping you waiting.

6
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:10,322
How did the negotiation go?

7
00:02:11,922 --> 00:02:13,142
Not too well.

8
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:17,223
Yao Yao.

9
00:02:17,802 --> 00:02:20,022
I cannot stay here now.

10
00:02:20,427 --> 00:02:22,402
And, I don't have a lot of money on me.

11
00:02:22,682 --> 00:02:24,403
Can I stay at your place for a few days?

12
00:02:24,506 --> 00:02:25,726
Of course.

13
00:02:26,162 --> 00:02:28,202
I'll move out immediately once I find a unit.

14
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:30,602
All right now. Let's not think about that.

15
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:33,364
You can sleep in my room. I can sleep in the living room.

16
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:34,484
No need for that.

17
00:02:34,565 --> 00:02:36,296
Junheng & Co has an agreement with the hotels nearby.

18
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,644
You can stay there under Cheng Yao's name. I'll arrange for it.

19
00:02:38,668 --> 00:02:40,578
Since when did our firm have such an agreement?

20
00:02:40,745 --> 00:02:41,965
It's quite new.

21
00:02:42,122 --> 00:02:43,342
Get in the car.

22
00:02:45,523 --> 00:02:46,743
Let's go.

23
00:02:58,523 --> 00:02:59,743
We're here.

24
00:03:01,188 --> 00:03:03,562
Boss, I'll help Ting Ting with the check-in procedure.

25
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:06,871
Let's go.

26
00:03:08,682 --> 00:03:09,902
Let's go.

27
00:03:12,722 --> 00:03:13,942
Slowly.

28
00:03:20,363 --> 00:03:21,583
Let's go.

29
00:03:25,162 --> 00:03:26,382
Wait for me in the main lobby.

30
00:03:28,763 --> 00:03:29,983
Be careful

31
00:03:41,002 --> 00:03:43,171
Boss, you should have some porridge first.

32
00:03:43,304 --> 00:03:44,808
If not, your gastric will act up again.

33
00:03:44,832 --> 00:03:46,101
Finish it before I come back.

34
00:03:46,323 --> 00:03:47,482
Okay?

35
00:03:47,647 --> 00:03:49,038
Are you threatening me?

36
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:53,652
Boss, I'm begging you here. Okay?

37
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,405
This won't do.

38
00:03:59,486 --> 00:04:01,387
What if you pour it away?

39
00:04:01,985 --> 00:04:04,145
What about this? Give me your phone.

40
00:04:04,257 --> 00:04:06,477
I'll log into my account and do a live stream for you.

41
00:04:07,483 --> 00:04:09,962
Can I just record the process and send it to you?

42
00:04:10,132 --> 00:04:11,796
What if you didn't record it?

43
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,750
I have to monitor you as you finish it.

44
00:04:15,235 --> 00:04:16,455
Hurry.

45
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:24,783
You're so troublesome.

46
00:04:27,523 --> 00:04:29,633
Creating a room...

47
00:04:31,142 --> 00:04:32,362
All done.

48
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:34,471
Set a password so that I can be your only audience.

49
00:04:34,495 --> 00:04:35,936
Other people won't be able to see it.

50
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,180
Have it while it's hot.

51
00:04:52,963 --> 00:04:54,442
You begged me to do this.

52
00:05:03,683 --> 00:05:05,842
You haven't had dinner, right?

53
00:05:06,031 --> 00:05:07,271
I bought some porridge for you.

54
00:05:08,098 --> 00:05:09,818
How did you know I wanted to have porridge?

55
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:17,202
Who ordered this for you?

56
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,442
Can't I order it myself?

57
00:05:19,922 --> 00:05:21,142
You do have a point.

58
00:05:23,203 --> 00:05:25,682
All right then. Eat up. Don't starve yourself.

59
00:05:26,341 --> 00:05:27,561
Let's eat together.

60
00:05:28,643 --> 00:05:29,863
Sure.

61
00:05:36,362 --> 00:05:37,856
- You ordered from this restaurant too? - Yeah.

62
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,431
I knew

63
00:05:40,802 --> 00:05:43,162
you liked their food. That's why I ordered it.

64
00:05:44,835 --> 00:05:47,442
Fei, you're pretty good at this, aren't you?

65
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:00,081
How did you know I wanted to have porridge?

66
00:06:00,105 --> 00:06:01,184
I don't know.

67
00:06:01,265 --> 00:06:02,865
Why did you order porridge for me, then?

68
00:06:03,643 --> 00:06:04,883
Their porridge is quite salty.

69
00:06:04,963 --> 00:06:07,003
You should order from another restaurant next time.

70
00:06:09,123 --> 00:06:10,643
Is there something wrong with my eyes?

71
00:06:12,123 --> 00:06:13,343
Text Cheng Yao.

72
00:06:13,577 --> 00:06:14,797
Immediately.

73
00:06:15,922 --> 00:06:17,142
I'll text her myself.

74
00:06:17,547 --> 00:06:18,667
Meng Ting,

75
00:06:18,802 --> 00:06:20,602
I've prepared some daily necessities for you.

76
00:06:20,706 --> 00:06:22,096
See if you need anything else.

77
00:06:24,087 --> 00:06:25,307
Nope.

78
00:06:34,563 --> 00:06:37,183
What's with the secret filming of Yang Qiong Qiong?

79
00:06:39,802 --> 00:06:42,042
I requested my hometown friend to film her in secret.

80
00:06:43,353 --> 00:06:45,193
I was so angry at them for committing adultery

81
00:06:45,234 --> 00:06:47,162
that I wanted to ruin their reputation.

82
00:06:48,123 --> 00:06:51,722
That's why I gave him my letter of authorization.

83
00:06:52,265 --> 00:06:54,255
I told him to acquire evidence on my behalf.

84
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:57,274
I did it out of spite.

85
00:06:57,374 --> 00:06:59,374
I forgot that I was infringing upon their privacy.

86
00:06:59,543 --> 00:07:02,023
So, you knew that you were infringing upon their privacy, huh?

87
00:07:02,482 --> 00:07:04,018
You're the only person who has the right to procure evidence.

88
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:05,642
If you filmed them yourself,

89
00:07:05,722 --> 00:07:07,443
your evidence would be considered legal.

90
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:09,428
But if you hire someone else...

91
00:07:10,162 --> 00:07:11,753
I know that.

92
00:07:11,907 --> 00:07:14,282
But I was so angry back then.

93
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,003
He cheated on me when I was pregnant.

94
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,762
Even so, I didn't receive any protection.

95
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,002
What should I do now?

96
00:07:24,628 --> 00:07:26,345
Do an inventory count of your shared assets with him

97
00:07:26,369 --> 00:07:27,762
and divide them accordingly.

98
00:07:29,362 --> 00:07:30,992
Must we resort to this?

99
00:07:31,722 --> 00:07:34,262
You saw Zhang Hao's attitude yourself.

100
00:07:34,602 --> 00:07:36,442
Your relationship with him is already over.

101
00:07:36,883 --> 00:07:39,112
You should do it for the sake of your children.

102
00:07:40,963 --> 00:07:42,183
You're right.

103
00:07:44,123 --> 00:07:45,833
They already accused me.

104
00:07:46,523 --> 00:07:48,002
Without the money,

105
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:51,282
I might not be able to raise my children.

106
00:08:01,123 --> 00:08:03,644
Ting Ting, my colleagues kept texting me.

107
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:05,722
I'll read them outside. I won't bother you.

108
00:08:05,802 --> 00:08:07,322
- All right. - Rest early.

109
00:08:07,448 --> 00:08:08,922
Call me if you need anything.

110
00:08:09,203 --> 00:08:10,423
Don't worry about me.

111
00:08:23,675 --> 00:08:25,442
Over 300 text messages?

112
00:08:25,563 --> 00:08:26,783
Is there an earthquake?

113
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:33,282
(Cheng Yao, I thought only a few people followed your account.)

114
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,440
(Why did our boss do a livestream on your account?)

115
00:08:35,947 --> 00:08:37,842
Didn't I tell him to set a password?

116
00:08:38,923 --> 00:08:40,602
Don't tell me he failed?

117
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,490
(Only you guys saw it, right?)

118
00:08:47,882 --> 00:08:49,482
(Initially.)

119
00:08:53,043 --> 00:08:55,002
What does he mean by that?

120
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:57,242
(What do you mean by that?)

121
00:08:57,322 --> 00:08:58,542
(What happened after that?)

122
00:09:00,242 --> 00:09:02,737
(For some reason, plenty of girls flooded into the room out of nowhere.)

123
00:09:02,761 --> 00:09:04,127
(They kept saying that he was handsome)

124
00:09:04,151 --> 00:09:06,178
(and that they wanted to become the porridge he was eating.)

125
00:09:06,202 --> 00:09:07,537
(They even sent him gifts.)

126
00:09:07,878 --> 00:09:10,722
(We can't afford to let outsiders rival our love for our boss.)

127
00:09:11,276 --> 00:09:13,873
(Therefore, I told everyone in Junheng & Co to send gifts to our boss.)

128
00:09:13,897 --> 00:09:16,097
(We must make him one of the top three live streamers.)

129
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,962
(This should be correct, right?)

130
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,883
(Is that the special effect of the app?)

131
00:09:51,163 --> 00:09:52,383
He stopped?

132
00:09:52,642 --> 00:09:53,862
I haven't had enough yet.

133
00:09:54,043 --> 00:09:55,263
He's so handsome.

134
00:09:56,466 --> 00:09:59,855
Aren't you guys curious as to why Lawyer Qian did a livestream?

135
00:10:00,482 --> 00:10:02,273
Actually, he has a fragile heart too.

136
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:03,882
Although he's outstanding,

137
00:10:04,163 --> 00:10:05,593
we don't praise him usually.

138
00:10:05,762 --> 00:10:08,691
He did the livestream so that we could praise him directly.

139
00:10:08,814 --> 00:10:10,898
That's why he forced Cheng Yao to give him her account.

140
00:10:10,922 --> 00:10:13,821
If so, why did he use Cheng Yao's account?

141
00:10:14,176 --> 00:10:15,805
It's because he fancies her.

142
00:10:18,283 --> 00:10:19,722
I was just kidding.

143
00:10:22,043 --> 00:10:23,402
That was a cold joke.

144
00:10:23,594 --> 00:10:25,103
Do you think you're humorous?

145
00:10:31,283 --> 00:10:33,873
Boss, people were viewing your livestream just now.

146
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:16,362
(This should be correct, right?)

147
00:11:31,265 --> 00:11:32,865
(Is that the special effect of the app?)

148
00:11:50,203 --> 00:11:51,423
(I finished everything.)

149
00:11:52,395 --> 00:11:55,423
(If you push your luck again, you'll be done for.)

150
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,802
They praise you just because you are handsome.

151
00:12:22,923 --> 00:12:24,962
You'll definitely be criticized

152
00:12:25,074 --> 00:12:26,962
if you aren't as good-looking as you are.

153
00:12:59,642 --> 00:13:00,862
You're awake.

154
00:13:04,563 --> 00:13:06,153
I did nothing just now.

155
00:13:19,323 --> 00:13:20,723
Someone passed by just now.

156
00:13:20,865 --> 00:13:22,815
He was selling some bread.

157
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,270
I bought them as he was noisy.

158
00:13:24,323 --> 00:13:25,543
Finish them for me.

159
00:13:25,914 --> 00:13:28,224
Why would someone sell bread here?

160
00:13:34,638 --> 00:13:35,858
I'll keep quiet.

161
00:13:41,928 --> 00:13:44,202
Since you had some porridge, let me buy you a meal.

162
00:13:46,362 --> 00:13:47,912
You plan to stand me up again

163
00:13:48,105 --> 00:13:51,122
and find another unknown woman to replace you, huh?

164
00:13:53,387 --> 00:13:55,522
What if I cook for you, then?

165
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,701
This is the only thing left.

166
00:14:11,498 --> 00:14:14,147
What about this? I'll add some eggs and sausages.

167
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:15,299
It's delicious too.

168
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,759
Do you think those junk food fit my style?

169
00:14:19,563 --> 00:14:21,082
Should I heat the tonic, then?

170
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:23,822
- There are cordyceps inside. - No need for that.

171
00:14:24,452 --> 00:14:27,282
I'll have this myself, then. I'll buy you a meal next time.

172
00:14:37,683 --> 00:14:38,903
It smells heavenly.

173
00:14:45,563 --> 00:14:47,032
Let me take a bite of the sausage.

174
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:50,442
It's delicious.

175
00:15:06,435 --> 00:15:08,856
Your instant noodles smell pretty good.

176
00:15:09,482 --> 00:15:10,718
This won't do.

177
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:13,842
I mustn't taint your pure stomach with such junk food.

178
00:15:14,103 --> 00:15:16,764
What about this? I'll have this in my room.

179
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,123
Hey.

180
00:15:18,226 --> 00:15:20,616
I bought you some bread. You should return the favor.

181
00:15:21,217 --> 00:15:23,287
Didn't I already return the favor?

182
00:15:23,777 --> 00:15:26,442
I thought you bought some bread to repay me for the porridge.

183
00:15:27,522 --> 00:15:29,603
I do feel like living like a commoner sometimes.

184
00:15:29,683 --> 00:15:30,903
Can't I do so?

185
00:15:31,792 --> 00:15:33,102
Beg me, then.

186
00:15:34,803 --> 00:15:37,802
I'll make you two extra eggs if you beg me.

187
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,203
Don't push your luck.

188
00:15:42,362 --> 00:15:43,582
It's so delicious.

189
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:50,503
It smells great.

190
00:15:52,203 --> 00:15:53,423
I...

191
00:15:53,722 --> 00:15:54,942
Please?

192
00:15:56,563 --> 00:15:57,904
Please make me a bowl of noodles.

193
00:15:58,145 --> 00:15:59,494
I want fried eggs and sausages too.

194
00:15:59,518 --> 00:16:00,828
You should've said that earlier.

195
00:16:01,242 --> 00:16:03,342
That was pretty cute. Wait here.

196
00:16:19,002 --> 00:16:20,482
I'm getting late!

197
00:16:30,714 --> 00:16:32,934
Boss? Why are you still here?

198
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:35,410
On usual days, you would've been at the law firm by now.

199
00:16:36,242 --> 00:16:38,423
Hurry up. I don't want to be late.

200
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,962
Are you sure I can hitch a ride?

201
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,162
But my buns have a strong scent.

202
00:17:03,936 --> 00:17:06,446
Don't overthink it. This is just an employee benefit.

203
00:17:09,123 --> 00:17:11,083
Boss, I'll definitely cherish the ride.

204
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,500
But

205
00:17:13,053 --> 00:17:14,533
you can drop me off in front.

206
00:17:14,684 --> 00:17:17,263
If not, our colleagues will see us in the same car.

207
00:17:19,002 --> 00:17:20,162
You don't need to get off that soon.

208
00:17:20,186 --> 00:17:22,402
They can't see clearly due to the thick haze.

209
00:17:22,505 --> 00:17:23,725
Haze?

210
00:17:24,603 --> 00:17:25,823
I don't see any haze.

211
00:17:28,802 --> 00:17:29,803
Boss,

212
00:17:29,968 --> 00:17:33,438
many things fall short all because of one slip-up, you know?

213
00:17:34,607 --> 00:17:37,266
What if people misunderstand the situation and ruin your reputation?

214
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,722
It'll be terrible by then.

215
00:17:56,923 --> 00:17:58,143
It's nothing.

216
00:18:11,163 --> 00:18:13,362
Why did he get angry all of a sudden?

217
00:18:18,771 --> 00:18:20,962
(15th Golden Scale Award: Dewei & Co)

218
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:36,419
Uncle.

219
00:18:36,523 --> 00:18:38,764
I've prepared your gift for Lawyer Lv.

220
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,207
I've made a dinner reservation too.

221
00:18:40,231 --> 00:18:41,820
The dinner is at 7.30pm.

222
00:18:43,441 --> 00:18:45,036
Lawyer Lv

223
00:18:45,117 --> 00:18:47,777
is the main judge of the Golden Scale Award.

224
00:18:48,322 --> 00:18:50,322
She's also the most experienced one of them all.

225
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,842
You better get your wits about you during the dinner.

226
00:18:53,562 --> 00:18:55,202
Don't worry, Uncle.

227
00:18:55,443 --> 00:18:56,663
Let's go.

228
00:19:02,603 --> 00:19:03,962
What gift have you prepared?

229
00:19:04,072 --> 00:19:05,423
Silk pajamas.

230
00:19:08,785 --> 00:19:10,306
Silk pajamas?

231
00:19:10,403 --> 00:19:13,482
Why would I prepare that for Lawyer Lv?

232
00:19:13,609 --> 00:19:14,829
You do have a point.

233
00:19:14,977 --> 00:19:16,722
I prepared that for your aunt, you fool.

234
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,270
Where are the makeup products?

235
00:19:18,434 --> 00:19:19,842
I gave them to Aunt.

236
00:19:25,272 --> 00:19:27,071
Deng Zi Xi,

237
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:28,762
how could you be so dense?

238
00:19:28,843 --> 00:19:31,003
Look at how dumb you are. You should change your name.

239
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,533
You should call yourself Dense Zi Xi instead.

240
00:19:32,557 --> 00:19:34,451
You do this every day, you know?

241
00:19:34,536 --> 00:19:35,756
I'm speechless.

242
00:19:39,722 --> 00:19:41,562
Lawyer Lv?

243
00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:45,539
The email? I've sent it to you.

244
00:19:45,747 --> 00:19:48,353
Yeah. I've sent it together with my resume for Dewei & Co

245
00:19:48,434 --> 00:19:49,642
and my personal profile.

246
00:19:54,177 --> 00:19:55,806
Lawyer Lv, how could that be?

247
00:19:56,216 --> 00:20:00,240
How could I say anything that would discriminate against divorcees?

248
00:20:00,363 --> 00:20:01,642
I promise you.

249
00:20:01,761 --> 00:20:02,981
I'm not lying.

250
00:20:14,802 --> 00:20:16,022
Let me see.

251
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,282
(A divorced woman)

252
00:20:21,873 --> 00:20:23,522
(is just someone who got dumped.)

253
00:20:23,857 --> 00:20:26,722
(You got dumped. Why are you still here acting all high and mighty, )

254
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:28,585
(feeling like you're different from others?)

255
00:20:28,609 --> 00:20:30,880
(Do you see yourself as a modern woman?)

256
00:20:31,961 --> 00:20:34,202
How could he say something like that?

257
00:20:38,851 --> 00:20:40,841
I think he has a point.

258
00:20:48,963 --> 00:20:50,183
Cheng Xi,

259
00:20:50,923 --> 00:20:52,143
just you wait.

260
00:21:08,683 --> 00:21:09,903
What are you trying to do?

261
00:21:13,002 --> 00:21:14,602
You want to argue with me in the yard?

262
00:21:15,218 --> 00:21:17,418
It would be terrible if someone else were to hear this.

263
00:21:22,713 --> 00:21:24,162
So, you recorded our conversation

264
00:21:24,312 --> 00:21:25,642
and sent it to Lawyer Lv, huh?

265
00:21:25,857 --> 00:21:27,402
How could you be so shameless?

266
00:21:27,626 --> 00:21:28,945
Lawyer Lv just got a divorce.

267
00:21:29,095 --> 00:21:31,156
She should be able to understand my feelings.

268
00:21:35,322 --> 00:21:36,542
If I must say,

269
00:21:36,724 --> 00:21:38,802
Cheng Xi, you're still as childish as ever.

270
00:21:38,963 --> 00:21:42,313
Listen. Even if I lose Lawyer Lv's support,

271
00:21:42,505 --> 00:21:44,065
I still have plenty of support outside.

272
00:21:45,064 --> 00:21:47,415
Other lawyers have wives too.

273
00:21:47,622 --> 00:21:49,603
Even if they don't, they definitely have mothers.

274
00:21:49,706 --> 00:21:51,336
You're being disrespectful of women.

275
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,771
What do you think they'll think of you

276
00:21:53,872 --> 00:21:55,165
when their female family members find out?

277
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:56,682
Enough. I'll stop arguing with you.

278
00:21:57,503 --> 00:22:00,122
Hurry and give me the recording.

279
00:22:06,722 --> 00:22:07,883
How's Cheng Yao doing?

280
00:22:07,986 --> 00:22:09,206
Is she doing well?

281
00:22:09,505 --> 00:22:11,576
I heard that she joined Junheng & Co.

282
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,980
Not bad at all.

283
00:22:13,363 --> 00:22:14,722
As her elder sister,

284
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:17,249
you have to guide her and help her out.

285
00:22:17,372 --> 00:22:19,523
You must tell her to be careful.

286
00:22:19,692 --> 00:22:22,056
It would be terrible if something happened and her reputation was ruined.

287
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,522
She won't be able to survive in this field by then.

288
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,202
At most, we can perish together!

289
00:22:26,336 --> 00:22:28,127
I have nothing to lose anyway.

290
00:22:28,325 --> 00:22:29,842
What about you, Lawyer Deng?

291
00:22:29,923 --> 00:22:31,379
You're a prideful person, aren't you?

292
00:22:31,403 --> 00:22:33,962
All of your past stories can be turned into scandals

293
00:22:34,088 --> 00:22:35,482
if I tell people about them!

294
00:22:36,082 --> 00:22:37,302
Lawyer Cheng!

295
00:22:40,241 --> 00:22:42,040
I need your help with a case.

296
00:22:42,202 --> 00:22:43,422
Please come inside.

297
00:22:48,883 --> 00:22:50,873
All right then. I'll make a move first.

298
00:22:59,482 --> 00:23:02,353
Cheng Xi, take good care of yourself.

299
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,402
Take good care of your sister too.

300
00:23:27,123 --> 00:23:28,482
Is this the property agent?

301
00:23:29,923 --> 00:23:32,353
Hello. I wish to find another unit.

302
00:23:40,322 --> 00:23:41,542
Meng Ting,

303
00:23:41,706 --> 00:23:43,282
how are you doing at the hotel?

304
00:23:43,762 --> 00:23:44,982
(I'm doing fine.)

305
00:23:45,556 --> 00:23:46,776
Yao Yao,

306
00:23:47,002 --> 00:23:48,642
I've thought about it the entire night.

307
00:23:48,828 --> 00:23:50,048
I've made up my mind.

308
00:23:50,203 --> 00:23:51,963
I wish to get a divorce as soon as possible.

309
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:54,680
And, I will try to fight for as many assets as I can get

310
00:23:54,978 --> 00:23:56,362
(and protect my rights.)

311
00:23:57,123 --> 00:23:58,482
I support your decision.

312
00:23:58,963 --> 00:24:00,402
(I only have one request.)

313
00:24:00,658 --> 00:24:02,487
I want to hire you as my lawyer.

314
00:24:04,363 --> 00:24:06,432
But I don't have enough experience.

315
00:24:07,082 --> 00:24:10,192
What about this? I'll ask my colleagues on the same team.

316
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:11,673
(No.)

317
00:24:12,091 --> 00:24:14,452
(I wish to hire someone who understands me)

318
00:24:14,634 --> 00:24:16,743
(and who I can trust.)

319
00:24:17,043 --> 00:24:18,482
(You're the only person)

320
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,082
I want to hire.

321
00:24:24,522 --> 00:24:25,742
All right.

322
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,600
Boss.

323
00:24:33,899 --> 00:24:35,119
Come in.

324
00:24:37,522 --> 00:24:39,073
What do you want for dinner?

325
00:24:41,562 --> 00:24:43,202
Just get straight to the point.

326
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:45,952
I wish to take on a case.

327
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,642
Is the fee at least 50 million yuan?

328
00:24:52,683 --> 00:24:56,515
Can you give me a discount since I cook for you every day?

329
00:24:56,623 --> 00:24:58,670
25 million. That's the lowest price I can give.

330
00:24:59,683 --> 00:25:01,512
Can you remove the term "million?"

331
00:25:01,963 --> 00:25:04,393
We can't just take on cases for the sake of money.

332
00:25:04,596 --> 00:25:08,316
Sometimes, we should help out the vulnerable

333
00:25:08,497 --> 00:25:11,326
and let people know that we're here to uphold justice too.

334
00:25:15,733 --> 00:25:16,953
Cheng Yao,

335
00:25:17,441 --> 00:25:19,071
what do you think

336
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:20,722
a lawyer should do?

337
00:25:21,006 --> 00:25:23,123
A lawyer should strive to fight for love, justice,

338
00:25:23,203 --> 00:25:25,060
and the completeness of the nation's legal system.

339
00:25:25,084 --> 00:25:26,604
- What's my surname? - Qian (money).

340
00:25:26,745 --> 00:25:28,905
That's why I only work for money. Love doesn't matter.

341
00:25:32,363 --> 00:25:34,242
But I became a lawyer in the first place

342
00:25:34,357 --> 00:25:36,883
so that I could help the people beside me.

343
00:25:37,092 --> 00:25:38,434
Not only do a good lawyer

344
00:25:38,577 --> 00:25:40,378
have to be responsible for their clients

345
00:25:40,496 --> 00:25:42,122
and perform their duties,

346
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:45,296
but they also have the responsibility to spread belief in the law.

347
00:25:49,163 --> 00:25:51,642
Boss, if you don't want to take on the case,

348
00:25:51,855 --> 00:25:53,405
can I take it on myself?

349
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:54,753
I have a lawyer's license too.

350
00:25:54,777 --> 00:25:57,168
Logically speaking, I can handle a case by myself.

351
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,080
Cheng Yao.

352
00:26:05,242 --> 00:26:08,512
What I said just now came from a boss's perspective.

353
00:26:09,642 --> 00:26:11,362
Even from a personal perspective,

354
00:26:11,473 --> 00:26:13,922
I don't suggest you take on Meng Ting's case.

355
00:26:14,363 --> 00:26:16,262
Is it because you think that I'll be swayed by my emotions

356
00:26:16,286 --> 00:26:18,922
as Meng Ting is my friend?

357
00:26:19,573 --> 00:26:20,793
That's right.

358
00:26:21,242 --> 00:26:23,058
You might be stuck in the case if you cannot maintain

359
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,553
complete neutrality.

360
00:26:24,761 --> 00:26:26,902
You won't be able to analyze all the details.

361
00:26:28,282 --> 00:26:30,162
But Meng Ting is a good friend of mine.

362
00:26:30,335 --> 00:26:32,044
At the same time, she's a litigant.

363
00:26:32,322 --> 00:26:34,402
I will remember that I'm a lawyer.

364
00:26:35,123 --> 00:26:37,752
To you, being sensitive might be a flaw.

365
00:26:37,914 --> 00:26:40,533
But sometimes, being sensitive might be a strength.

366
00:26:40,721 --> 00:26:41,817
For example,

367
00:26:41,898 --> 00:26:45,083
if we analyze the situation coldly when our client has a breakdown,

368
00:26:45,171 --> 00:26:47,211
they might not let down their guard and talk to us.

369
00:26:47,341 --> 00:26:49,803
We have to talk to them slowly while being empathetic.

370
00:26:49,966 --> 00:26:52,283
This way, they might be able to face reality

371
00:26:52,425 --> 00:26:53,645
and trust us.

372
00:26:57,883 --> 00:26:59,313
Boss, why are you keeping quiet?

373
00:27:03,802 --> 00:27:05,162
Aren't you scared?

374
00:27:05,353 --> 00:27:06,573
I'm not.

375
00:27:06,722 --> 00:27:08,903
I just wish to help my friend out.

376
00:27:10,883 --> 00:27:13,823
Find me if you encounter any issues.

377
00:27:15,568 --> 00:27:17,608
You better don't mess it up and ruin my reputation.

378
00:27:17,843 --> 00:27:19,063
Thank you, boss.

379
00:27:19,562 --> 00:27:20,782
I'll return to work now.

380
00:27:30,123 --> 00:27:31,343
Silly girl.

381
00:27:41,522 --> 00:27:43,682
My boss has agreed to let me be your attorney.

382
00:27:43,864 --> 00:27:46,272
This is great! Thank you guys so much.

383
00:27:46,603 --> 00:27:49,575
Our first step is to contact Zhang Hao and negotiate with him.

384
00:27:49,684 --> 00:27:50,904
Okay.

385
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,810
He's not picking up. Let me call him again.

386
00:28:09,923 --> 00:28:11,562
Don't tell me he blocked us?

387
00:28:13,002 --> 00:28:14,313
That scum.

388
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,402
How dare he do this?

389
00:28:17,785 --> 00:28:19,794
That's fine. If he doesn't want to negotiate,

390
00:28:19,882 --> 00:28:21,242
we'll engage him in a lawsuit.

391
00:28:21,923 --> 00:28:23,143
Okay.

392
00:28:23,518 --> 00:28:25,638
By the way, when I was organizing

393
00:28:25,843 --> 00:28:27,722
our shared assets,

394
00:28:27,802 --> 00:28:29,022
I found this.

395
00:28:30,348 --> 00:28:32,122
A marital loyalty agreement?

396
00:28:33,788 --> 00:28:35,748
If either side of the party commits infidelity,

397
00:28:35,867 --> 00:28:37,947
he or she shall renounce their assets automatically.

398
00:28:38,123 --> 00:28:39,482
When did you sign this?

399
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,762
After we got our marriage certificate.

400
00:28:41,843 --> 00:28:45,263
I was thinking that since Zheng Hao and I were entering a new phase,

401
00:28:45,388 --> 00:28:48,123
this was like a pact between us.

402
00:28:48,224 --> 00:28:51,364
Back then, I was perplexed why it took him two days to sign this.

403
00:28:51,445 --> 00:28:54,063
- Is this usable? - Of course.

404
00:28:54,322 --> 00:28:55,843
This agreement is entirely legal.

405
00:28:55,954 --> 00:28:57,503
It's complete.

406
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,450
Right now, we just need to gather evidence.

407
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:02,432
The judge will award the house to you

408
00:29:02,545 --> 00:29:04,646
during the division of property.

409
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:06,863
Zhang Hao will lose everything.

410
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:13,184
It's a shame that I was overruled by anger back then.

411
00:29:13,282 --> 00:29:15,419
The evidence I told my friend to gather cannot be used.

412
00:29:15,443 --> 00:29:16,793
Not only were they not usable,

413
00:29:16,896 --> 00:29:19,956
but it also alerted him and his mistress.

414
00:29:20,322 --> 00:29:22,663
Will it be more difficult for us to procure evidence now?

415
00:29:22,966 --> 00:29:26,544
Now, you just need to look after yourself and your babies.

416
00:29:26,643 --> 00:29:27,912
Leave the rest to me.

417
00:29:28,341 --> 00:29:31,081
I can only focus on your case if you and your babies stay safe.

418
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:36,239
It's like they know I'm having a rough time lately.

419
00:29:36,403 --> 00:29:37,699
They were causing me trouble before this.

420
00:29:37,723 --> 00:29:39,243
But they're much more obedient lately.

421
00:29:39,428 --> 00:29:40,648
Really?

422
00:29:43,194 --> 00:29:44,676
You two must be obedient, okay?

423
00:29:44,767 --> 00:29:46,922
Don't give your mother a hard time.

424
00:30:05,643 --> 00:30:07,363
- Come here. - Madam.

425
00:30:07,443 --> 00:30:08,752
Are you looking for Lawyer Qian?

426
00:30:08,843 --> 00:30:10,002
Why should I look for him?

427
00:30:10,121 --> 00:30:11,341
I'm looking for you.

428
00:30:11,785 --> 00:30:13,603
You helped me test him last time.

429
00:30:13,684 --> 00:30:15,362
But there wasn't any reaction.

430
00:30:15,562 --> 00:30:17,363
This time, I'll go further.

431
00:30:17,497 --> 00:30:18,657
Look.

432
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,843
I've found him some blind date partners.

433
00:30:20,923 --> 00:30:22,843
I got 30 of them. Let's check them out together.

434
00:30:22,967 --> 00:30:25,162
30? Isn't that too many?

435
00:30:25,288 --> 00:30:27,442
Not at all. He can attend one blind date per day.

436
00:30:27,561 --> 00:30:30,271
He'll be done in 30 days.

437
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:32,742
Look. What do you think?

438
00:30:33,858 --> 00:30:35,523
But Lawyer Qian is quite busy with work.

439
00:30:35,603 --> 00:30:37,243
I'm afraid he doesn't have time for this.

440
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,975
He said that he was no longer young

441
00:30:41,084 --> 00:30:43,562
and that he was willing to accept my blind date arrangements.

442
00:30:44,146 --> 00:30:45,506
I didn't force him to attend them.

443
00:30:47,592 --> 00:30:49,002
That's pretty good.

444
00:30:49,185 --> 00:30:51,215
Yeah, I think so too.

445
00:30:51,443 --> 00:30:52,482
Think about it.

446
00:30:52,616 --> 00:30:54,687
If he gets a partner this year,

447
00:30:54,928 --> 00:30:58,122
I might have a grandson by next year.

448
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,780
When that happens,

449
00:30:59,994 --> 00:31:03,242
the legacy of the Qian family will be able to live on.

450
00:31:03,488 --> 00:31:05,047
I'm happy just thinking about it.

451
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:07,636
I'm sure my grandson will be cute.

452
00:31:11,242 --> 00:31:12,672
But I think

453
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:16,002
Qian Heng is full of flaws too.

454
00:31:16,257 --> 00:31:18,082
He'll scare the ladies away.

455
00:31:18,298 --> 00:31:19,339
What do you think?

456
00:31:19,443 --> 00:31:21,043
Madam, Lawyer Qian is a great person.

457
00:31:21,123 --> 00:31:23,643
I'm sure plenty of ladies will fancy him. Don't worry about it.

458
00:31:23,969 --> 00:31:25,189
Really?

459
00:31:25,694 --> 00:31:28,401
Why do I feel like he's full of flaws?

460
00:31:28,505 --> 00:31:30,616
Look. He's harsh when he speaks.

461
00:31:30,863 --> 00:31:32,293
He has a low EQ.

462
00:31:32,465 --> 00:31:34,574
He doesn't know how to make girls happy too.

463
00:31:34,816 --> 00:31:37,207
You want him to be romantic? Just forget about it.

464
00:31:37,409 --> 00:31:38,629
Don't you think so?

465
00:31:39,592 --> 00:31:40,752
A little.

466
00:31:40,883 --> 00:31:44,512
But Madam, Qian Heng only speaks harshly. He's kind at heart.

467
00:31:46,065 --> 00:31:47,522
I knew it.

468
00:31:47,802 --> 00:31:50,192
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

469
00:31:51,293 --> 00:31:52,802
Madam, that's not what I mean.

470
00:31:52,946 --> 00:31:54,176
Madam, you misunderstood me.

471
00:31:54,762 --> 00:31:56,242
I didn't misunderstand you.

472
00:31:56,482 --> 00:31:59,432
Cheng Yao, just admit it.

473
00:31:59,683 --> 00:32:02,192
Why would you see him in such a way

474
00:32:02,722 --> 00:32:04,722
if you didn't have any feelings for him?

475
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,722
I don't. Madam, please stop it.

476
00:32:06,813 --> 00:32:09,083
Boss will misunderstand me if he hears us.

477
00:32:12,647 --> 00:32:14,980
(Danger! Your mother is in the firm now.)

478
00:32:15,132 --> 00:32:16,962
I was young too.

479
00:32:17,042 --> 00:32:18,202
I did what you did before.

480
00:32:18,335 --> 00:32:20,485
It's not embarrassing to fall for someone.

481
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,823
- Just admit it. - I...

482
00:32:21,904 --> 00:32:23,725
I think Lawyer Qian has plenty of flaws too.

483
00:32:23,811 --> 00:32:26,717
For example, he's cold, has a terrible personality and a bad temper.

484
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:28,508
He's not loving and empathetic at all.

485
00:32:28,683 --> 00:32:30,562
How could I fall for someone like him?

486
00:32:30,946 --> 00:32:33,465
Madam, you should find more blind date partners for him.

487
00:32:33,603 --> 00:32:38,602
Okay. I will definitely consider what you said seriously.

488
00:32:38,802 --> 00:32:40,282
I have something to do. I have to go.

489
00:32:40,352 --> 00:32:41,572
I'm not...

490
00:32:45,522 --> 00:32:46,742
Boss.

491
00:32:57,683 --> 00:32:59,186
I'll give you a chance to explain yourself.

492
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:01,442
(How much of it did he hear?)

493
00:33:01,762 --> 00:33:03,793
(Where should I start?)

494
00:33:04,923 --> 00:33:05,962
Boss,

495
00:33:06,096 --> 00:33:08,566
I'm not viewing you with a filter because I fell for you.

496
00:33:09,363 --> 00:33:11,482
I never intended to covet you.

497
00:33:11,617 --> 00:33:12,837
Covet me?

498
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:15,398
I have no other thoughts about you.

499
00:33:16,643 --> 00:33:19,192
No other thoughts about me? What does that mean?

500
00:33:19,466 --> 00:33:21,867
You can attend as many blind dates as you want.

501
00:33:21,963 --> 00:33:23,923
You don't need to care about what I think of you.

502
00:33:24,017 --> 00:33:26,246
Do you think it's necessary for me to care about that?

503
00:33:28,116 --> 00:33:29,336
I'm sorry.

504
00:33:29,963 --> 00:33:32,002
Cheng Yao, have I been too lenient toward you?

505
00:33:32,175 --> 00:33:34,722
Is that why you think you can do whatever you want to me?

506
00:33:35,042 --> 00:33:37,202
That's not it. Boss, I'm sorry. I know my fault now.

507
00:33:37,311 --> 00:33:41,326
- Tell me about your fault. - I shouldn't have invaded your privacy.

508
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:43,842
And, I shouldn't have said all those things about you.

509
00:33:44,082 --> 00:33:46,363
I should've just fulfilled my duties as your subordinate.

510
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,702
Subordinate, huh?

511
00:33:48,978 --> 00:33:52,408
That's right. You're only a subordinate.

512
00:33:53,082 --> 00:33:54,803
I hope you can know your own place

513
00:33:54,898 --> 00:33:57,717
and focus on your work instead of my personal life!

514
00:34:01,363 --> 00:34:02,583
Get out.

515
00:34:04,522 --> 00:34:05,742
Get out!

516
00:34:27,803 --> 00:34:29,513
(That's right. You're only a subordinate.)

517
00:34:29,681 --> 00:34:31,401
(I hope you can know your own place)

518
00:34:31,497 --> 00:34:34,168
(and focus on your work instead of my personal life!)

519
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:40,978
You're only my boss. This is none of your business.

520
00:34:41,002 --> 00:34:42,181
Of course this is my business.

521
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,845
It's because you're very important to me.

522
00:35:05,738 --> 00:35:08,339
We'll make contact with each other often in the future due to work.

523
00:35:08,363 --> 00:35:10,522
I hope you can hold on to your bottom line.

524
00:35:10,668 --> 00:35:11,720
What do you mean by that?

525
00:35:11,824 --> 00:35:13,744
I've already fired 13 assistants before you came

526
00:35:13,796 --> 00:35:15,722
due to their unprofessional behavior.

527
00:35:17,194 --> 00:35:20,033
(Cheng Yao, stop your wishful thinking.)

528
00:35:20,412 --> 00:35:21,732
(You're just a subordinate.)

529
00:35:21,859 --> 00:35:23,810
(Don't make your boss angry again.)

530
00:35:36,604 --> 00:35:38,722
(Sorry)

531
00:35:40,563 --> 00:35:42,682
This meal will be my apology to him.

532
00:36:34,756 --> 00:36:37,625
(I'll make you two extra eggs if you beg me.)

533
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:39,198
Boss, you should have some porridge first.

534
00:36:39,222 --> 00:36:40,782
If not, your gastric will act up again.

535
00:36:40,994 --> 00:36:42,624
Finish it before I come back.

536
00:36:43,803 --> 00:36:46,248
You always starve yourself for too long. Your stomach will be damaged.

537
00:36:46,272 --> 00:36:49,363
I'll sacrifice five days of paid leave as long as you eat.

538
00:36:49,481 --> 00:36:50,991
I'm already yours now.

539
00:36:51,184 --> 00:36:52,404
You have to cover up for me.

540
00:36:57,384 --> 00:36:59,183
I think Lawyer Qian has plenty of flaws too.

541
00:36:59,311 --> 00:37:02,792
For example, he's cold, has a terrible personality and a bad temper.

542
00:37:03,162 --> 00:37:04,537
He's not loving and empathetic at all.

543
00:37:04,561 --> 00:37:06,242
How could I fall for someone like him?

544
00:37:06,323 --> 00:37:08,263
I have no other thoughts about you.

545
00:37:09,682 --> 00:37:11,922
No other thoughts about me? What does that mean?

546
00:37:12,475 --> 00:37:14,875
You can attend as many blind dates as you want.

547
00:37:14,993 --> 00:37:16,953
You don't need to care about what I think of you.

548
00:37:29,966 --> 00:37:32,031
Hello? Is this the relocation company?

549
00:37:32,585 --> 00:37:34,522
Arrange a time for me. I'm moving.

550
00:37:58,522 --> 00:38:01,322
(Sorry)

551
00:38:23,403 --> 00:38:24,752
Boss, you're back.

552
00:38:25,664 --> 00:38:27,055
Dinner is ready.

553
00:38:27,923 --> 00:38:30,097
- No need for that. - I'll make supper for you, then.

554
00:38:30,121 --> 00:38:31,721
You don't need to do that in the future.

555
00:38:32,483 --> 00:38:33,666
I'm planning to move out.

556
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,720
The relocation company will arrive in a few days.

557
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:42,520
This is great. You're finally moving back to your villa.

558
00:38:42,743 --> 00:38:45,642
I knew rented units didn't fit your style.

559
00:38:46,682 --> 00:38:49,063
Are you that happy that I'm moving out?

560
00:38:49,283 --> 00:38:50,503
Of course not.

561
00:38:51,082 --> 00:38:53,321
I won't receive any professional guidance once you're gone.

562
00:38:53,345 --> 00:38:54,565
I'm heartbroken.

563
00:38:56,529 --> 00:38:57,838
Return Lemon Mascot to me.

564
00:38:57,945 --> 00:39:00,324
It's in my room. Boss, you can go ahead.

565
00:39:15,868 --> 00:39:18,402
(Can we hold the meeting tomorrow?)

566
00:39:19,495 --> 00:39:22,115
(I just broke up. I feel terrible.)

567
00:39:22,457 --> 00:39:24,002
I'll make life worse for you

568
00:39:25,027 --> 00:39:26,602
if you don't get up now.

569
00:39:27,243 --> 00:39:30,312
Have you forsaken your humanity long ago?

570
00:39:47,355 --> 00:39:48,575
I'm up.

571
00:39:48,723 --> 00:39:49,943
Go ahead.

572
00:39:53,868 --> 00:39:55,088
Qian.

573
00:39:59,602 --> 00:40:00,872
Qian Heng!

574
00:40:03,202 --> 00:40:04,422
Where were we just now?

575
00:40:06,622 --> 00:40:08,022
(I'm sick.)

576
00:40:08,103 --> 00:40:10,223
(Even so, you woke me up to hold a video conference.)

577
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,922
(And, you were actually distracted.)

578
00:40:13,133 --> 00:40:14,882
(You must be the devil.)

579
00:40:19,403 --> 00:40:20,623
Wu,

580
00:40:21,176 --> 00:40:22,536
say,

581
00:40:22,989 --> 00:40:26,482
if someone doesn't care about your departure

582
00:40:26,843 --> 00:40:29,323
or shows no sign of unhappiness when you're leaving, is she...

583
00:40:29,365 --> 00:40:31,962
What are you mumbling about? Can you raise your volume?

584
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:36,402
I said you're dismissed!

585
00:40:39,122 --> 00:40:40,342
I'm hanging up.

586
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:45,672
He must be the devil.

587
00:40:45,763 --> 00:40:46,883
He must be the devil.

588
00:40:46,963 --> 00:40:48,272
He must be the devil.

589
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:52,331
He's a devil.

590
00:40:52,443 --> 00:40:53,872
He must be the devil.

591
00:42:50,082 --> 00:42:52,382
See you, Cheng Yao. Don't stay here until too late.

592
00:43:01,849 --> 00:43:02,968
(I'm planning to move out.)

593
00:43:03,071 --> 00:43:05,111
(The relocation company will arrive in a few days.)

594
00:43:06,286 --> 00:43:08,722
(I guess he went back to move his things.)

595
00:43:10,346 --> 00:43:12,067
(I should go and take a walk later.)

596
00:43:12,306 --> 00:43:13,962
(I don't want to go home that early.)
