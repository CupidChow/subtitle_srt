1
00:01:35,552 --> 00:01:38,882
(My Boss)

2
00:01:40,013 --> 00:01:42,210
(Episode 19)

3
00:01:42,312 --> 00:01:45,874
(Boss, I love you. I want to have a baby with you.)

4
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,573
Mr. Qian, it's time to go. Can we go now?

5
00:02:18,811 --> 00:02:20,031
Just wait for 10 more minutes.

6
00:02:20,163 --> 00:02:21,757
You've said it three times already.

7
00:02:21,867 --> 00:02:24,264
All of us are waiting to finish this job and then go off work.

8
00:02:24,288 --> 00:02:25,998
Are you still planning to move?

9
00:02:28,513 --> 00:02:29,713
Let's go.

10
00:02:29,902 --> 00:02:31,252
Come on, guys. Let's move.

11
00:02:51,297 --> 00:02:52,517
Ms. Zhu.

12
00:02:53,103 --> 00:02:54,617
Please hold a seminar.

13
00:02:54,838 --> 00:02:58,069
The topic will be how to balance a lawyer's personal life and work.

14
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,780
I'll come up with the outline.

15
00:04:20,376 --> 00:04:21,686
(I live alone now.)

16
00:04:21,874 --> 00:04:23,474
(What's the point of me cooking supper?)

17
00:04:36,812 --> 00:04:38,281
Just eat whatever.

18
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,410
(Boss, give me a few ice cream.)

19
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:44,922
(These kiddos...)

20
00:06:02,842 --> 00:06:03,990
(Boss, these two.)

21
00:06:04,474 --> 00:06:05,699
(What else?)

22
00:06:05,873 --> 00:06:07,642
You watch the drama faster than me.

23
00:06:09,846 --> 00:06:11,846
(Episode 21: I'm her boyfriend.)

24
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:42,888
It's all your fault.

25
00:06:45,834 --> 00:06:47,362
What kind of look is that?

26
00:06:59,394 --> 00:07:02,602
Wu, send me the materials for the case you gave me before.

27
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:05,256
Who was it that told me before that he was dissatisfied

28
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,447
with the small amount of the claim and asked me to reject it?

29
00:07:07,471 --> 00:07:09,991
He even said lawyers who work for money are the key to success.

30
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,322
Lawyers who work for passion are now starving to death.

31
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:14,762
Do you know how the talkative lawyer died?

32
00:07:15,793 --> 00:07:17,313
I'll send it to you now.

33
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,600
A moment, please.

34
00:07:53,993 --> 00:07:55,213
Good morning, boss.

35
00:07:55,376 --> 00:07:56,596
Good morning, boss.

36
00:07:57,594 --> 00:07:58,814
Good morning, boss.

37
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,340
Good morning, boss.

38
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,290
Bao Rui.

39
00:08:04,431 --> 00:08:05,662
You look good today.

40
00:08:10,387 --> 00:08:12,537
You're paying more and more attention to me.

41
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,602
That's not good. Be careful.

42
00:08:31,822 --> 00:08:33,453
Boss, let's eat.

43
00:09:25,383 --> 00:09:26,642
Yu Fei, let's go eat.

44
00:09:26,849 --> 00:09:28,787
You can go by yourself. I brought lunch today.

45
00:09:28,937 --> 00:09:30,727
Fei, you can cook?

46
00:09:31,055 --> 00:09:32,522
These are all the dishes I love.

47
00:09:32,752 --> 00:09:34,012
Really?

48
00:09:34,093 --> 00:09:35,790
I can't eat them all. Then, let's eat together.

49
00:09:35,814 --> 00:09:37,034
Okay.

50
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,560
How many pairs of chopsticks do you have?

51
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,940
Two pairs.

52
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,271
Cheng Yao, let's go eat.

53
00:09:44,775 --> 00:09:46,282
I brought my own lunch.

54
00:09:46,582 --> 00:09:47,802
You brought yours too?

55
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,400
Why is everyone bringing their own lunch now?

56
00:09:50,488 --> 00:09:52,002
Let me see, what did you bring?

57
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,042
It looks better than what Yu Fei cooked.

58
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,573
Can you handle eating all of this by yourself?

59
00:10:02,793 --> 00:10:04,974
I accidentally made too much.

60
00:10:05,265 --> 00:10:07,546
- And there's my favorite ribs too. - Cheng Yao, you...

61
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,500
What's wrong?

62
00:10:16,968 --> 00:10:18,599
There's an important document

63
00:10:19,001 --> 00:10:20,441
that I need you to help me retrieve.

64
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,390
Can't we just have the client send it by express delivery?

65
00:10:24,654 --> 00:10:27,568
It's a crucial document requiring personal delivery and video recording.

66
00:10:27,689 --> 00:10:28,909
I'll send you the address.

67
00:10:30,234 --> 00:10:31,454
Okay.

68
00:10:33,492 --> 00:10:34,971
You can't eat in front of the client

69
00:10:35,146 --> 00:10:36,622
as it will affect Junheng & Co's image.

70
00:10:36,646 --> 00:10:38,046
I'll finish eating in the car.

71
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:41,150
There's a 100 yuan meal allowance for field work that should be utilized.

72
00:10:41,596 --> 00:10:43,317
Then, what about the lunch I brought?

73
00:10:43,472 --> 00:10:44,741
Won't it go to waste?

74
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:47,173
Well, that's up to you.

75
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,042
I had to give it away.

76
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,162
- Bao. - Thank you.

77
00:11:03,394 --> 00:11:04,614
Wait a minute.

78
00:11:05,793 --> 00:11:07,314
- What's wrong? - You, her...

79
00:11:07,394 --> 00:11:09,402
Boss, your lunch is here.

80
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,307
Okay.

81
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,260
You can have this.

82
00:11:19,114 --> 00:11:20,743
You pamper me blatantly.

83
00:11:21,662 --> 00:11:23,981
If I eat yours,

84
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,404
what about the loving lunch from Cheng Yao?

85
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:29,834
She worked so hard to make it. What should I...

86
00:11:29,991 --> 00:11:33,042
- I can't eat that much. - It's okay. I'll take care of it for you.

87
00:11:37,153 --> 00:11:38,373
You're so kind.

88
00:11:49,735 --> 00:11:50,955
Do you have chopsticks?

89
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,700
No chopsticks.

90
00:12:15,947 --> 00:12:17,562
This leftover meal...

91
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,282
This is quite thoughtful.

92
00:12:58,754 --> 00:13:01,184
You watch TV series while working

93
00:13:04,311 --> 00:13:06,682
Qian Heng, what happened?

94
00:13:07,433 --> 00:13:09,719
I remember the old Qian Heng wouldn't tolerate

95
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,024
even the slightest noise at work.

96
00:13:12,143 --> 00:13:14,682
Even if I breathed too loudly, he couldn't tolerate it.

97
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,840
But now I feel that some noise can actually help me

98
00:13:17,984 --> 00:13:19,613
focus more during work.

99
00:13:20,075 --> 00:13:21,155
Is that so?

100
00:13:21,313 --> 00:13:23,442
Then, can you please explain to me

101
00:13:24,202 --> 00:13:26,002
what about this?

102
00:13:27,461 --> 00:13:28,501
Flowers?

103
00:13:28,673 --> 00:13:31,815
They can make me happy and improve my work efficiency.

104
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,233
Nonsense.

105
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,104
It sounds like you've left the monastery.

106
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,038
Are you saying I used to be a monk?

107
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,030
I've never seen you show interest in any woman.

108
00:13:43,975 --> 00:13:45,999
Based on your current behavior,

109
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,800
if we're talking about a man, he must be...

110
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:53,054
Are you in love?

111
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,562
How is that possible?

112
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,869
You scared me.

113
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:03,042
- Why did you come to me? - Right.

114
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,522
I want to talk about Cheng Yao's matter.

115
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,322
Have you noticed Cheng Yao getting close to anyone in the office recently?

116
00:14:11,076 --> 00:14:12,296
No one.

117
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:13,614
What do you mean?

118
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:16,122
I know a gift supplier.

119
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,549
He asked me to post an ad for him on my social media.

120
00:14:18,662 --> 00:14:20,554
Cheng Yao saw it and liked something,

121
00:14:20,635 --> 00:14:21,962
asking me to order one for her.

122
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,482
She said it was for her teacher,

123
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:26,904
but I don't think so.

124
00:14:26,995 --> 00:14:29,341
It must be for a guy.

125
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,311
Cheng Yao just joined Junheng & Co.

126
00:14:37,663 --> 00:14:41,053
She has never shown any signs of love before.

127
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,202
But in just a few months,

128
00:14:43,393 --> 00:14:45,682
she's already buying things for a guy.

129
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,922
What does this mean?

130
00:14:51,553 --> 00:14:52,773
Don't you know?

131
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,998
Exactly! It's office romance.

132
00:14:56,185 --> 00:14:57,334
Isn't it?

133
00:14:58,255 --> 00:14:59,682
Isn't it office romance?

134
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,460
No way.

135
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,310
Cheng Yao will be my sister-in-law in the future.

136
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:06,654
I have to keep an eye on her

137
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,200
and make sure she doesn't get fooled by some young guy in our law firm.

138
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:12,383
If that happens, how do I explain to Cheng Xi then?

139
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,900
Right?

140
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,460
What?

141
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,001
You're her boss.

142
00:15:23,115 --> 00:15:25,246
She's always under your nose.

143
00:15:25,336 --> 00:15:27,246
Haven't you noticed anything suspicious?

144
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,242
How would I know? What does it have to do with me?

145
00:15:30,405 --> 00:15:32,592
How does it not have anything to do with you?

146
00:15:32,749 --> 00:15:35,042
Are you my buddy? If you're my buddy, it involves you.

147
00:15:35,123 --> 00:15:36,842
You have to keep an eye on her for me.

148
00:15:37,014 --> 00:15:38,375
Especially when she's under my control.

149
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,629
Nothing can go wrong.

150
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:42,959
Cheng Xi doesn't really like me now.

151
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,800
If something happens again under my control,

152
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,060
I'm done for.

153
00:15:46,473 --> 00:15:48,860
Okay, I understand. You should go back quickly.

154
00:15:50,553 --> 00:15:52,074
Give me a spare key to the villa.

155
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:53,405
Why?

156
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,960
Don't worry about why. I'm not doing anything bad. Hurry up.

157
00:16:18,842 --> 00:16:24,803
(New Group Chat 5)

158
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,282
(There's an important matter.)

159
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,220
(What group is this?)

160
00:16:33,531 --> 00:16:36,147
(The fewer words, the bigger the issue.)

161
00:16:36,249 --> 00:16:38,642
(Oh my god. Junheng & Co won't disband, right?)

162
00:16:40,342 --> 00:16:43,202
(Does it mean we are automatically assigned to Lawyer Wu?)

163
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,070
(What?)

164
00:16:45,802 --> 00:16:47,842
(I'll be sad if I leave Lawyer Qian.)

165
00:16:53,106 --> 00:16:55,056
(Next weekend, it's Lawyer Qian's birthday.)

166
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,760
(Do you guys understand what I mean?)

167
00:16:57,139 --> 00:17:00,482
(Lawyer Wu, do you want us to present ourselves as a gift for him?)

168
00:17:01,641 --> 00:17:03,202
(You can be more confident.)

169
00:17:03,584 --> 00:17:05,257
(Everyone, prepare in advance.)

170
00:17:05,446 --> 00:17:09,836
(We'll all go together to Qian Heng's villa to give him a surprise.)

171
00:17:09,983 --> 00:17:11,515
(What do you guys want to eat? Let me know.)

172
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:12,579
(I'll arrange everything.)

173
00:17:12,673 --> 00:17:14,024
(Long live Lawyer Wu.)

174
00:17:14,594 --> 00:17:17,682
(Can we have delicious, super supreme pizza?)

175
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,162
(Cheng Yao)

176
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,860
Boss.

177
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:48,382
I have something I want to ask you in person. Is it okay?

178
00:17:50,058 --> 00:17:51,278
You come here.

179
00:17:52,091 --> 00:17:53,120
At the villa.

180
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,429
(I'll send you the location.)

181
00:17:54,513 --> 00:17:55,642
Okay.

182
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,020
Good morning, boss.

183
00:19:02,834 --> 00:19:05,882
What's up? Are you looking for me regarding some work-related matters?

184
00:19:07,394 --> 00:19:10,903
Not entirely work-related.

185
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,340
Then, it's a personal matter.

186
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,842
Is it necessary to dress like this for a personal matter?

187
00:19:20,936 --> 00:19:23,179
Don't even think about it. I won't go back with you.

188
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,200
No matter how well you dress, it's useless.

189
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,402
Boss, you misunderstood.

190
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:30,787
You don't need to explain.

191
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,040
I completely understand your thoughts.

192
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,779
After all, we spend every day together.

193
00:19:34,803 --> 00:19:37,233
After I moved out, you have a feeling of loss.

194
00:19:37,318 --> 00:19:38,538
It's normal.

195
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,540
Come in.

196
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,213
If you...

197
00:19:42,294 --> 00:19:43,645
I can't go in yet.

198
00:19:46,273 --> 00:19:47,493
Why?

199
00:19:51,394 --> 00:19:52,623
Surprise.

200
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,913
(Happy birthday, Lawyer Qian.)

201
00:19:54,016 --> 00:19:56,608
Happy birthday, Lawyer Qian.

202
00:20:06,483 --> 00:20:08,632
Why do I feel like Lawyer Qian is not very happy?

203
00:20:08,736 --> 00:20:10,176
Did I do too well in this job?

204
00:20:10,303 --> 00:20:12,574
Did I surprise him too much? He was so moved that he couldn't speak.

205
00:20:12,598 --> 00:20:14,313
Judging by his expression, it doesn't appear to be a surprise.

206
00:20:14,337 --> 00:20:16,122
It's more like the calm before the storm.

207
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,906
Didn't Lawyer Wu say he would be our inside man? Where is he?

208
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,071
Happy birthday, Qian.

209
00:20:24,535 --> 00:20:26,735
Come on. Let's wish Lawyer Qian a happy birthday.

210
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:30,162
Happy birthday.

211
00:20:30,316 --> 00:20:31,906
Don't shout first.

212
00:20:32,153 --> 00:20:35,149
Wu Jun. How dare you sneak into my house?

213
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,882
Your words are so harsh.

214
00:20:37,025 --> 00:20:38,385
How can it be considered sneaking?

215
00:20:38,479 --> 00:20:40,322
You personally handed me the key.

216
00:20:40,403 --> 00:20:41,482
Do you remember?

217
00:20:41,563 --> 00:20:43,283
I walked in openly.

218
00:20:43,639 --> 00:20:45,547
It's just that earlier, you were working in the study room.

219
00:20:45,571 --> 00:20:46,961
You didn't see me.

220
00:20:49,629 --> 00:20:53,819
Qian. Turning 30 is an important stage for a man.

221
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:57,499
I absolutely won't allow you to spend your birthday working.

222
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,913
So all of us must give Lawyer Qian a very happy birthday. Right?

223
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,622
I don't need it.

224
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,090
Everyone is busy with work

225
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,720
and finally has a weekend to rest.

226
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:11,739
You still drag them out to socialize. Have you considered their feelings?

227
00:21:12,023 --> 00:21:14,423
- Are they not feeling good? - We feel pretty good.

228
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:16,045
I've always wanted to come here.

229
00:21:16,129 --> 00:21:17,889
But I didn't dare so I could only endure it.

230
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:21,381
If there's a chance, I still want to deeply experience and understand

231
00:21:21,462 --> 00:21:24,022
Lawyer Qian's aesthetic and decorating style.

232
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,207
- I also want to broaden my horizons. - You see.

233
00:21:27,397 --> 00:21:29,663
Since everyone is so interested, come, follow me.

234
00:21:29,764 --> 00:21:31,189
I'll take everyone to visit. How about it?

235
00:21:31,213 --> 00:21:33,234
- Let's go. - Go.

236
00:21:33,322 --> 00:21:34,762
There's also the bottom floor.

237
00:21:35,114 --> 00:21:37,960
Let me tell you, the level below is super interesting.

238
00:21:38,069 --> 00:21:40,124
Come on, everyone, follow me.

239
00:21:40,256 --> 00:21:44,314
This area here is Lawyer Qian's kitchen.

240
00:21:44,448 --> 00:21:46,362
Come. Let's move over here.

241
00:21:46,858 --> 00:21:49,035
Come on, everyone, look this way.

242
00:21:49,155 --> 00:21:51,714
Come. Now we are entering one of the attractions for today,

243
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:54,824
the study area of Qian Heng.

244
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,962
Come on, keep up with my pace.

245
00:21:58,068 --> 00:21:59,210
Come on, keep up with me.

246
00:21:59,314 --> 00:22:00,633
Yes, keep up with my pace.

247
00:22:00,713 --> 00:22:03,571
Come, after we go through this spiral staircase,

248
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:05,965
we will reach the most important place for today.

249
00:22:06,046 --> 00:22:07,266
Come on.

250
00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:10,506
My friends, how is it?

251
00:22:10,587 --> 00:22:12,656
Is it beautiful? Is it impressive?

252
00:22:12,794 --> 00:22:15,680
Where you are standing now is the best viewing spot of Qian Heng's villa.

253
00:22:15,704 --> 00:22:17,002
The view is amazing.

254
00:22:17,122 --> 00:22:19,442
Come on. Come up. Come up and take a look.

255
00:22:20,093 --> 00:22:21,642
The pool terrace.

256
00:22:21,825 --> 00:22:23,402
This is too comfortable.

257
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,200
Look over there.

258
00:22:32,305 --> 00:22:33,664
It's all my fault for not being educated.

259
00:22:33,688 --> 00:22:35,002
I can only say "Wow".

260
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:37,722
Swimming pool.

261
00:22:37,993 --> 00:22:40,034
All right, I think everyone has seen enough.

262
00:22:40,114 --> 00:22:43,599
Let's move to the backyard and have a barbecue.

263
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,002
Let's get excited!

264
00:22:45,193 --> 00:22:46,584
Come on, let's go.

265
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,540
Stop messing around.

266
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,682
No need. I'll do it for you all.

267
00:23:17,473 --> 00:23:19,193
Here. This one is done.

268
00:23:19,304 --> 00:23:20,802
Thank you, Lawyer Wu.

269
00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:22,925
The barbecue chef I hired today is really skilled.

270
00:23:22,949 --> 00:23:24,368
Everyone. Take more and eat more.

271
00:23:24,473 --> 00:23:26,173
If there's not enough, just tell me.

272
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,851
- Thank you, Lawyer Wu. - Thank you, Lawyer Wu.

273
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,162
Thank you, Lawyer Wu.

274
00:23:29,949 --> 00:23:32,459
Who came up with the idea of having a barbecue

275
00:23:32,602 --> 00:23:34,356
on this hot day, at noon, on this big lawn?

276
00:23:34,734 --> 00:23:36,275
I thought it was you.

277
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:38,936
I thought you had a brain malfunction when you came up with this idea.

278
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,442
It wasn't me.

279
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,070
I chose pizza.

280
00:23:44,888 --> 00:23:47,199
Is it you, Tan Ying? Only you're under Lawyer Wu.

281
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,480
How could it be me? I'm so afraid of getting sunburned.

282
00:23:50,634 --> 00:23:53,099
Try this freshly cooked steak. Try it.

283
00:23:53,248 --> 00:23:55,642
How is it? Is the seasoning of the skewers okay today?

284
00:23:56,129 --> 00:23:57,602
I haven't tried them yet, but...

285
00:24:05,991 --> 00:24:07,211
It's a little hot.

286
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,362
Wasn't it cool yesterday?

287
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,842
I don't know why it's so hot today.

288
00:24:18,815 --> 00:24:21,082
I was thinking that we usually sit in the office all day

289
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,950
and don't get to experience nature.

290
00:24:23,154 --> 00:24:24,959
So I thought it would be nice

291
00:24:25,066 --> 00:24:28,061
to sit outside, soak up some sun, and enjoy the greenery.

292
00:24:28,142 --> 00:24:29,572
Doesn't it put you in a good mood?

293
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,870
You should find a cooler spot.

294
00:24:32,193 --> 00:24:33,522
Here, I have a fan.

295
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,080
Cheng Yao, come with me for a moment.

296
00:24:43,198 --> 00:24:45,518
A client's prenuptial agreement needs to be revised.

297
00:24:45,656 --> 00:24:47,322
Do we need to do it now?

298
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,420
Do you have any objections?

299
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,353
No.

300
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:53,888
The pizza that Cheng Yao ordered will be here soon.

301
00:24:53,912 --> 00:24:55,952
Let her eat first before leaving.

302
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:58,119
This is urgent. It needs to be revised immediately.

303
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,420
Hurry up.

304
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,939
I'll save it for you. Don't worry.

305
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,410
Then, you guys can eat more.

306
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,220
Look at Qian. Is it that urgent?

307
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:15,693
It's cool here.

308
00:25:17,473 --> 00:25:18,693
You can revise it here.

309
00:25:24,594 --> 00:25:25,814
This one.

310
00:25:37,927 --> 00:25:39,447
You really know how to enjoy yourself.

311
00:25:58,473 --> 00:25:59,693
Hello.

312
00:26:02,439 --> 00:26:03,559
You've arrived?

313
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,199
Okay, wait for me.

314
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,500
I'll come out and find you.

315
00:26:08,009 --> 00:26:09,402
I can't take it anymore.

316
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:11,978
Despite the barbecue being prepared by a five-star chef,

317
00:26:12,002 --> 00:26:14,376
I couldn't bring myself to eat it in this scorching weather.

318
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,600
Since the takeout has arrived, let's go inside and eat.

319
00:26:17,095 --> 00:26:18,307
- Hurry up and go inside. - Let's go.

320
00:26:18,331 --> 00:26:20,613
If we don't go in soon, Junheng & Co's future will collapse.

321
00:26:20,637 --> 00:26:21,882
- Let's go. - Go.

322
00:26:21,963 --> 00:26:23,754
Oh my, it's so hot.

323
00:26:24,918 --> 00:26:26,540
Friends, let's go inside and eat.

324
00:26:26,649 --> 00:26:29,002
Hello, your Pizza Hut dishes have all arrived.

325
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,480
- Enjoy your meal. - Okay, thank you for your hard work.

326
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,301
- The takeout has arrived. - I'm alive again.

327
00:26:35,325 --> 00:26:38,287
I knew the people at Junheng & Co are really in sync.

328
00:26:38,368 --> 00:26:40,169
The food just arrived. I was just about to call you guys.

329
00:26:40,193 --> 00:26:42,392
- Hurry, each person takes one. - Let's take it.

330
00:26:42,473 --> 00:26:45,173
- Come, hurry up. - Give it to me.

331
00:26:52,118 --> 00:26:53,235
- Is it good? - It's delicious.

332
00:26:53,259 --> 00:26:54,756
- How's the pizza? - Delicious.

333
00:26:54,837 --> 00:26:56,226
It's still warm.

334
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,840
The view outside is amazing. Let me take a picture for you.

335
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,140
Qian.

336
00:27:10,592 --> 00:27:13,733
The takeout just arrived. I was about to go down and bring some to you.

337
00:27:19,913 --> 00:27:22,362
In your name, I sent a birthday invitation to Cheng Xi.

338
00:27:22,848 --> 00:27:24,968
Can you call her and ask her if she has left home

339
00:27:25,104 --> 00:27:26,322
and where she is now?

340
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,941
You invited them to my house

341
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:32,162
just to use my birthday for you to have a date with Cheng Xi, right?

342
00:27:32,648 --> 00:27:35,313
No. Of course, your birthday is the most important.

343
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,759
This place of yours is so empty and lonely.

344
00:27:38,855 --> 00:27:41,095
You even use the noise from a TV series as background...

345
00:27:43,016 --> 00:27:47,586
I invited so many people to add a touch of human atmosphere to the villa.

346
00:27:47,687 --> 00:27:49,744
Well, I haven't seen Cheng Xi in a few days.

347
00:27:49,926 --> 00:27:51,445
I finally came up with this idea.

348
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:52,899
Did you get my approval?

349
00:27:53,794 --> 00:27:55,162
Since it's a surprise,

350
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:57,066
of course I have to keep it from you.

351
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,522
The employees are very happy, right?

352
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,962
It's pretty good. It's a team-building event.

353
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,242
I don't see them happy.

354
00:28:09,033 --> 00:28:10,253
Qian,

355
00:28:10,753 --> 00:28:13,344
I put a lot of effort into planning this birthday party for you.

356
00:28:13,433 --> 00:28:14,744
Hurry up.

357
00:28:15,392 --> 00:28:16,842
You're annoying.

358
00:28:21,634 --> 00:28:22,793
Don't say I didn't save you.

359
00:28:22,874 --> 00:28:25,150
(Sorry, something came up with my case last minute.)

360
00:28:25,252 --> 00:28:26,929
(I couldn't make it to your birthday party.)

361
00:28:26,953 --> 00:28:28,096
(Wishing you a happy birthday, )

362
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,800
(and may Junheng & Co continue to thrive.)

363
00:28:36,345 --> 00:28:37,565
I have no hope now.

364
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,759
Since you couldn't join them for the gathering due to work,

365
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,882
so I just brought some food as compensation.

366
00:28:49,439 --> 00:28:51,274
I don't know which flavor you like,

367
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,922
so I brought a slice of each.

368
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,300
Just eat whatever you want.

369
00:28:55,688 --> 00:28:57,242
Thank you, boss.

370
00:29:14,134 --> 00:29:16,643
Boss, go and enjoy your birthday party.

371
00:29:16,947 --> 00:29:18,931
Just leave me working here alone.

372
00:29:19,072 --> 00:29:21,056
It's an honor for me to be able to work in your study room.

373
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,310
Don't feel embarrassed.

374
00:29:22,391 --> 00:29:24,571
And don't think that you have to suffer with me.

375
00:29:25,193 --> 00:29:26,393
Don't think too much.

376
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,371
There are many confidential documents in my room.

377
00:29:28,395 --> 00:29:29,814
I don't trust you being here alone.

378
00:29:29,946 --> 00:29:31,402
I'm sitting here to supervise you.

379
00:29:40,959 --> 00:29:44,189
Boss, did you let me work here because it's too sunny outside?

380
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,882
Sometimes, being too narcissistic is not a good thing.

381
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,925
You all came to celebrate my birthday without informing me.

382
00:29:48,949 --> 00:29:51,088
Do I have to change my work schedule for you?

383
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,900
This prenuptial agreement must be finished today.

384
00:30:18,824 --> 00:30:20,573
Boss, you have your book upside down.

385
00:30:23,953 --> 00:30:25,642
The book cover is on the wrong side.

386
00:30:25,749 --> 00:30:27,939
Focus on your work. Why are you looking around?

387
00:31:48,898 --> 00:31:51,642
Sorry, boss. I'm so tired. I'm sorry.

388
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,060
I'll continue working now.

389
00:31:53,193 --> 00:31:55,362
No need. I'm afraid you'll overwork yourself to death.

390
00:31:55,464 --> 00:31:56,904
I still have to take responsibility.

391
00:31:57,335 --> 00:31:59,482
Oh, boss. Can you wait for me for a moment?

392
00:32:14,554 --> 00:32:16,673
Boss, this is your birthday gift from me.

393
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,440
I chose this gift box especially for you.

394
00:32:18,493 --> 00:32:19,757
Hope you like it.

395
00:32:19,866 --> 00:32:22,215
I'm worried that I won't be there when they give you gifts.

396
00:32:22,239 --> 00:32:23,829
So I give it to you in advance.

397
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,631
I see. So this gift box is for me?

398
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,749
Boss, Cheng Yao.

399
00:32:32,872 --> 00:32:34,282
Come up and play poker.

400
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,260
You go first.

401
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,013
I haven't finished revising the prenuptial agreement yet.

402
00:32:40,037 --> 00:32:42,231
No need. Even if you finish, I won't use it.

403
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,999
If there's anything wrong, you can tell me. I can make changes.

404
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,482
No need, you go ahead.

405
00:32:52,783 --> 00:32:54,003
Okay then.

406
00:33:01,822 --> 00:33:03,936
- Do you have it? - If you don't have it, I'll win.

407
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,180
Two-kings.

408
00:33:06,033 --> 00:33:07,362
Do you want it?

409
00:33:07,447 --> 00:33:09,383
- The biggest one. - How is it? Is the agreement done?

410
00:33:09,407 --> 00:33:10,627
Not yet.

411
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,302
Then, let's eat something first.

412
00:33:12,326 --> 00:33:14,875
You have no idea how hot the weather became after you left.

413
00:33:18,673 --> 00:33:19,919
That one is very delicious.

414
00:33:20,054 --> 00:33:21,884
Why didn't you guys eat much?

415
00:33:22,673 --> 00:33:24,064
We saved a lot.

416
00:33:25,016 --> 00:33:27,242
Lawyer Wu is great at organizing gatherings.

417
00:33:27,607 --> 00:33:29,888
So many delicious food. Our quality of life has improved.

418
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,244
If we aspire to enhance our future culinary offerings,

419
00:33:32,268 --> 00:33:34,388
it remains crucial to align ourselves with Lawyer Wu.

420
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,320
What about this? In a few days, it will be Lawyer Wu's birthday.

421
00:33:37,344 --> 00:33:39,562
I'll persuade him to organize another one.

422
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,140
Good idea.

423
00:34:02,085 --> 00:34:04,522
(I love you. I want to have a baby with you.)

424
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,962
You're quite daring.

425
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,962
Wishing everyone good food and drinks.

426
00:34:19,168 --> 00:34:21,922
Thank you, Lawyer Wu.

427
00:34:22,482 --> 00:34:23,702
Plane.

428
00:34:24,507 --> 00:34:26,274
- Plane. - I can't take it.

429
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:27,568
Qian.

430
00:34:27,711 --> 00:34:31,031
It's such a happy day, but Cheng Xi is not here. I feel so sad.

431
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:32,647
Can you call her again? Can you help me?

432
00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:33,942
Can you ask her to come?

433
00:34:34,023 --> 00:34:35,632
- You're drunk. - I'm not.

434
00:34:35,726 --> 00:34:37,185
He's drunk. Find someone to take him back.

435
00:34:37,209 --> 00:34:39,842
I'm not drunk, really.

436
00:34:39,997 --> 00:34:41,306
I still want to play games.

437
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,910
Let's play hide and seek, okay?

438
00:34:45,033 --> 00:34:47,634
Does Lawyer Wu have any childhood regrets?

439
00:34:47,776 --> 00:34:49,336
What's fun about playing hide and seek?

440
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:52,461
Maybe he wants to fulfill his childhood dream.

441
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,591
Qian, let's start with you.

442
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:57,936
This is such a childish game. You can play by yourself.

443
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,641
The first person to find Qian Heng will receive a prize of 10,000 yuan.

444
00:34:59,665 --> 00:35:00,825
Who's in?

445
00:35:04,881 --> 00:35:06,909
- I do. - Cheng Yao is in.

446
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:08,330
Who else? A prize of 10,000 yuan.

447
00:35:08,354 --> 00:35:10,154
- 10,000 yuan. - Me.

448
00:35:10,234 --> 00:35:11,944
I want to play too.

449
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,991
Look, it's what the people want.

450
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,754
All right, just this once. No more exceptions.

451
00:35:19,904 --> 00:35:21,124
Great.

452
00:35:21,366 --> 00:35:24,633
So it's decided. Qian, find a place to hide later.

453
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,234
Anywhere inside the villa will do.

454
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:28,602
- We'll come find you. - Got it.

455
00:35:31,743 --> 00:35:35,462
98, 99, 100.

456
00:35:35,638 --> 00:35:38,082
Okay, the game officially begins now. Let's go.

457
00:35:38,526 --> 00:35:39,922
Over there.

458
00:35:41,354 --> 00:35:42,802
There might be someone over there.

459
00:35:43,402 --> 00:35:45,482
No, there isn't. Where is he?

460
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,522
No, the house is too big.

461
00:35:53,223 --> 00:35:54,821
I already checked over there. He's not there.

462
00:35:54,845 --> 00:35:56,755
His house is too big.

463
00:36:10,194 --> 00:36:12,373
- Did you find him? - No.

464
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,780
Upstairs.

465
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:22,399
- Cheng Yao, did you find him? - No.

466
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,004
- Found him? - No.

467
00:36:24,121 --> 00:36:25,881
It's strange. I searched the whole building.

468
00:36:26,015 --> 00:36:27,446
Could our boss be invisible?

469
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,981
Invisible? Why didn't you say he was captured by a monster?

470
00:36:30,113 --> 00:36:31,154
That's impossible.

471
00:36:31,293 --> 00:36:33,639
How can our boss be so good at playing hide and seek?

472
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,980
Do we stand any chance of winning the 10,000 yuan prize?

473
00:36:38,553 --> 00:36:40,473
Why don't we go to the rooftop and look for him?

474
00:36:40,754 --> 00:36:42,194
Didn't we already visit the rooftop?

475
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,640
You saw it too. The boundless place cannot hide anyone.

476
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,202
But there's a swimming pool.

477
00:36:46,402 --> 00:36:49,274
What if he felt hot and jumped in the pool?

478
00:36:49,408 --> 00:36:50,628
Then what?

479
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:53,343
- Is he holding his breath in there? - I have a villa.

480
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,792
There is also a rooftop there.

481
00:36:54,816 --> 00:36:57,674
When I rest, I sit alone on the rooftop and drink coffee.

482
00:36:57,777 --> 00:37:00,402
It's a rare moment that can make me feel very relaxed.

483
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,621
I know why we couldn't find our boss.

484
00:37:02,874 --> 00:37:04,094
Because we have Yu Fei,

485
00:37:04,553 --> 00:37:05,823
who lowers the IQ of our team.

486
00:37:07,479 --> 00:37:08,519
Fine.

487
00:37:08,709 --> 00:37:10,042
Then, you can find him yourself.

488
00:37:11,465 --> 00:37:12,685
You're mad.

489
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,300
Yu Fei.

490
00:37:15,575 --> 00:37:16,935
Great. No more stupid teammates.

491
00:37:17,016 --> 00:37:18,322
We'll split the 10,000 yuan.

492
00:37:18,937 --> 00:37:20,242
Actually, with you by my side,

493
00:37:20,394 --> 00:37:22,042
I am confident in finding our boss.

494
00:37:22,216 --> 00:37:24,336
Let's split the 10,000 yuan equally. 5,000 yuan each.

495
00:37:24,545 --> 00:37:25,774
Our boss belongs to us.

496
00:37:25,863 --> 00:37:27,142
10,000 yuan belongs to us.

497
00:37:27,223 --> 00:37:28,893
Cheng Yao, as long as you follow me...

498
00:37:52,113 --> 00:37:54,402
How come you drink alone here? Don't you want to play?

499
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:56,082
How boring.

500
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,222
I stopped playing hide and seek since elementary school.

501
00:37:58,246 --> 00:37:59,466
Let's just have a drink.

502
00:38:00,593 --> 00:38:02,913
There's no more alcohol. How about we go out and buy some?

503
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,380
There's still a bottle here.

504
00:38:08,204 --> 00:38:09,754
Do you want to join me for a drink?

505
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,420
Sure.

506
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,580
Cheng Yao, where are you?

507
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,400
Wasn't he looking for Lawyer Qian? How come it ended so quickly?

508
00:38:29,844 --> 00:38:31,064
No.

509
00:38:41,696 --> 00:38:42,916
Why are you hiding?

510
00:38:44,166 --> 00:38:45,386
I'm not hiding.

511
00:38:49,394 --> 00:38:51,343
Then, let's go.

512
00:38:52,354 --> 00:38:54,762
Let's find a secluded place

513
00:38:55,513 --> 00:38:56,733
and have a drink.

514
00:38:59,314 --> 00:39:01,082
Okay, let's go.

515
00:39:06,394 --> 00:39:07,614
Let's go.

516
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:03,442
Boss, I knew you were here.

517
00:40:04,686 --> 00:40:05,906
How did you know?

518
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,100
Because I have magic.

519
00:40:12,425 --> 00:40:14,844
No matter where you hide, I can find you.

520
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,162
- Cheng Yao. - I found our boss!

521
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,940
Let's go down.

522
00:40:38,875 --> 00:40:40,322
Yeah! 10,000 yuan.

523
00:40:53,754 --> 00:40:55,733
Did you really find our boss on the rooftop?

524
00:40:57,033 --> 00:41:00,033
Can you not tell him when Yu Fei asks you?

525
00:41:00,113 --> 00:41:01,673
Just say you found him in the bathroom.

526
00:41:01,848 --> 00:41:04,168
Do you think I would stay in the bathroom for a few hours?

527
00:41:05,344 --> 00:41:07,042
But the bathroom is pretty clean.

528
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,621
Lawyer Wu, I already found Lawyer Qian.

529
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,400
What about the promised 10,000 yuan bonus?

530
00:41:16,936 --> 00:41:18,156
Wow, it's real.

531
00:41:18,386 --> 00:41:19,836
Let's congratulate Cheng Yao.

532
00:41:19,917 --> 00:41:21,409
She was the first one to find Qian Heng.

533
00:41:21,433 --> 00:41:22,653
Congratulations.

534
00:41:22,754 --> 00:41:24,882
Lawyer Wu, you are the best boss I have ever seen.

535
00:41:25,272 --> 00:41:27,682
Because of this, I will give you an extra 3,000 yuan.

536
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,962
Tell your friends and family about this.

537
00:41:32,061 --> 00:41:33,842
- Praise me more. - No problem.

538
00:41:33,964 --> 00:41:35,537
- I will definitely talk about it every day. - Okay.

539
00:41:35,561 --> 00:41:38,442
Cheng Yao, since you were the first one to find me,

540
00:41:38,695 --> 00:41:40,015
you can make a wish to me.

541
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,340
Any wish is fine.

542
00:41:41,834 --> 00:41:43,054
Really?

543
00:41:46,394 --> 00:41:49,134
Boss, your generosity and compassion truly stand out.

544
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:52,674
Now, everything you didn't dare to say or do before

545
00:41:52,808 --> 00:41:54,028
is within reach.

546
00:41:54,394 --> 00:41:55,864
Anything is possible?

547
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:57,901
You can say it.

548
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,660
Then, I'll say it.

549
00:42:00,978 --> 00:42:03,432
- I'm ready. - I'm going to say now.

550
00:42:08,953 --> 00:42:10,322
I want an increment.

551
00:42:10,633 --> 00:42:12,743
Are you serious?

552
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,276
Go to sleep. You can have everything in your dreams.

553
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,875
Didn't you just say anything is possible?

554
00:42:20,899 --> 00:42:22,402
It's okay, Cheng Yao.

555
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,670
Young people must have dreams and aspirations.

556
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,362
If he won't give you a raise, I will.

557
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,460
Lawyer Wu.

558
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,882
I also want a raise.

559
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:41,593
- Me too. - Me too.

560
00:42:41,674 --> 00:42:42,894
Cheng Yao.

561
00:42:43,194 --> 00:42:45,042
Don't you have anything else to say?

562
00:42:45,873 --> 00:42:47,602
What else do you want her to say?

563
00:42:48,277 --> 00:42:49,636
Hurry up and follow the procedure.

564
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,256
- Shouldn't we cut the cake now? - Yes.

565
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,005
- Where's the cake? - What about an increment?

566
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:54,498
Where's the cake?

567
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,133
(Happy birthday to you.)

568
00:42:58,214 --> 00:43:01,670
(Happy birthday to you.)

569
00:43:01,751 --> 00:43:05,522
(Happy birthday to you.)

570
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,981
(Happy birthday to you.)

571
00:43:13,551 --> 00:43:16,142
(I hope Cheng Yao will make me less angry in the future.)

572
00:43:17,077 --> 00:43:19,762
Happy birthday.

573
00:43:20,026 --> 00:43:22,402
What's your wish? Tell us about it.
