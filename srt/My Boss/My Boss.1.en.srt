1
00:01:02,241 --> 00:01:04,615
Come on, Mr. Fang. Let's go for one more.

2
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:05,977
Okay, one more.

3
00:01:06,058 --> 00:01:07,058
Come on.

4
00:01:09,915 --> 00:01:11,835
I forgot to introduce them just now.

5
00:01:11,962 --> 00:01:13,361
This is Yao Yao.

6
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:14,562
This is Ting Ting.

7
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,304
You can rest assured that these two girls

8
00:01:16,385 --> 00:01:18,602
will definitely drink till you're satisfied tonight.

9
00:01:18,713 --> 00:01:19,713
Nice.

10
00:01:20,483 --> 00:01:22,082
Very nice.

11
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,711
Mr. Fang. This is the proposal prepared by Mr. Yao for you.

12
00:01:26,482 --> 00:01:27,482
Yao Yao.

13
00:01:27,602 --> 00:01:29,733
Let's put the proposal aside for now.

14
00:01:29,843 --> 00:01:31,042
Let's drink first.

15
00:01:31,123 --> 00:01:32,283
Then, we can talk about work.

16
00:01:32,361 --> 00:01:33,445
- Yes. - Isn't that right, Yao?

17
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:35,488
If we don't drink well, how can we talk about work?

18
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,101
Come on. Let's have one.

19
00:01:37,888 --> 00:01:39,948
Nice to meet you for the first time. Cheers!

20
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:41,913
Come on, Mr. Fang.

21
00:01:49,552 --> 00:01:51,426
You have a good drinking capacity.

22
00:01:51,707 --> 00:01:53,842
I'll add another cup for Yao Yao.

23
00:01:54,372 --> 00:01:55,922
Come on, Yao Yao.

24
00:01:56,955 --> 00:01:58,962
Mr. Fang. I'm not very good at drinking.

25
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:02,042
Cheng Yao. Serving customers is our most basic duty.

26
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,329
- Just a bit of alcohol and you're dawdling. - Yao.

27
00:02:04,414 --> 00:02:06,334
For newcomers, we have to slowly cultivate them.

28
00:02:06,368 --> 00:02:09,758
We have to use drinks to establish our relationships.

29
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:10,978
Come on. It's just a bit of alcohol.

30
00:02:11,002 --> 00:02:12,188
- Don't dawdle. - Let's add a bit more.

31
00:02:12,212 --> 00:02:15,883
Come on. This is the link that connects us.

32
00:02:16,389 --> 00:02:17,642
That's great.

33
00:02:18,486 --> 00:02:20,122
Yao Yao. So,

34
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:22,604
give me that plan.

35
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,482
I'll explain it in detail to Mr. Fang.

36
00:02:26,641 --> 00:02:28,001
Let me tell you, Mr. Fang.

37
00:02:28,087 --> 00:02:29,619
- Stop drinking. - This proposal has been

38
00:02:29,643 --> 00:02:31,016
- Why? - carefully studied by me.

39
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,321
- You're here. - Ms. Lin. My time is precious.

40
00:02:34,401 --> 00:02:36,477
Inviting me to dinner will require a fee.

41
00:02:36,563 --> 00:02:40,202
No problem. I'll go with your price. I won't bargain.

42
00:02:40,391 --> 00:02:43,602
My fee is 10,000 yuan per hour, excluding transportation fee.

43
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:44,761
Fine.

44
00:02:44,866 --> 00:02:48,402
Considering you're tall, cute, and handsome,

45
00:02:48,641 --> 00:02:49,922
I want you for the whole day,

46
00:02:50,038 --> 00:02:51,498
which means 24 hours.

47
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:52,602
Can you do it?

48
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:55,063
They actually dare to talk about this openly.

49
00:02:55,147 --> 00:02:56,667
What a moral decline.

50
00:02:56,936 --> 00:02:59,802
How can people believe that knowledge changes fate then?

51
00:02:59,999 --> 00:03:01,202
Yeah.

52
00:03:06,576 --> 00:03:08,122
But, it really is worth 10,000 yuan.

53
00:03:08,225 --> 00:03:10,986
However, you didn't make an appointment today. So, I can't serve you.

54
00:03:11,822 --> 00:03:15,636
Look at this. Every dish has been served.

55
00:03:15,717 --> 00:03:19,002
How can I finish it all alone?

56
00:03:19,756 --> 00:03:21,402
Consider it again.

57
00:03:21,717 --> 00:03:23,682
Just have a meal with me

58
00:03:23,762 --> 00:03:26,802
and then we go for a walk. Okay?

59
00:03:26,955 --> 00:03:28,054
I'm not free.

60
00:03:32,121 --> 00:03:35,562
I'll give you 20,000 yuan per hour. That should be enough, right?

61
00:03:35,643 --> 00:03:37,484
- 20,000 yuan? - Ms. Lin.

62
00:03:37,602 --> 00:03:39,082
I only provide professional services.

63
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,000
I don't do anything outside of my profession.

64
00:03:42,825 --> 00:03:44,145
Think it over.

65
00:03:44,226 --> 00:03:45,801
The price is negotiable.

66
00:03:45,882 --> 00:03:47,162
Even 20,000 yuan is not enough?

67
00:03:47,388 --> 00:03:48,870
Yao Yao.

68
00:03:49,006 --> 00:03:50,026
Right now,

69
00:03:50,107 --> 00:03:53,907
I really want to hear your opinion on this proposal.

70
00:03:54,003 --> 00:03:55,003
Is that okay?

71
00:03:55,971 --> 00:03:57,441
Come on, cheers.

72
00:03:59,042 --> 00:04:00,752
(Even he can do it without shame.)

73
00:04:00,859 --> 00:04:01,938
(Why am I still here?)

74
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:03,682
- Cheers. - For what?

75
00:04:04,733 --> 00:04:06,811
What kind of service attitude is this?

76
00:04:06,892 --> 00:04:08,047
What are you doing, Cheng Yao?

77
00:04:08,071 --> 00:04:10,459
Hurry up and apologize to Mr. Fang. Do you still want the job?

78
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:11,642
I'm a lawyer.

79
00:04:11,722 --> 00:04:13,698
I only provide professional services, nothing else.

80
00:04:13,722 --> 00:04:14,722
You...

81
00:04:17,704 --> 00:04:18,704
I quit.

82
00:04:23,357 --> 00:04:25,162
Yao Yao. Are you really quitting?

83
00:04:25,275 --> 00:04:27,083
What's this? I studied so hard for so many years

84
00:04:27,107 --> 00:04:28,426
to realize my legal ideals,

85
00:04:28,513 --> 00:04:29,834
not to drink with them!

86
00:04:29,938 --> 00:04:31,178
We are legitimate lawyers.

87
00:04:31,282 --> 00:04:32,287
Yeah.

88
00:04:32,368 --> 00:04:33,764
But, you mustn't tell Hao Zi.

89
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,216
If Hao Zi finds out, he'll scold me.

90
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,169
Ting Ting, we have to be ourselves and not let others control us.

91
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,722
Okay. I know.

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,442
What you said is right.

93
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:43,803
No matter what, we should have some dignity.

94
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:46,394
We can't lose to that person just now.

95
00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:50,042
You're right.

96
00:05:01,222 --> 00:05:02,682
- Please. - Thank you.

97
00:05:06,165 --> 00:05:07,875
It seems we really can't beat him.

98
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:20,162
Wait, what? He's so rich that he has a Bentley?

99
00:05:22,598 --> 00:05:24,756
But, maybe he works hard

100
00:05:24,898 --> 00:05:26,608
day and night too.

101
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,034
But, regardless of gender,

102
00:05:36,115 --> 00:05:37,936
this kind of behavior of degrading oneself is not worth promoting.

103
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,920
- Yeah, right. - Ting Ting, stop persuading me.

104
00:05:39,975 --> 00:05:42,323
I'm never going back. I want to be a dignified lawyer.

105
00:05:42,404 --> 00:05:43,701
Okay, I won't persuade you.

106
00:05:43,782 --> 00:05:45,172
I'll quit with you.

107
00:05:46,194 --> 00:05:48,041
I've already disliked Yao Feng since long ago.

108
00:05:48,121 --> 00:05:50,762
And, your act just now was really cool.

109
00:05:51,441 --> 00:05:53,432
- Let's go and get something to eat. - Let's go.

110
00:05:53,456 --> 00:05:55,046
We didn't even eat enough just now.

111
00:07:23,642 --> 00:07:26,802
(My Boss)

112
00:07:27,098 --> 00:07:28,575
(Episode 1)

113
00:07:28,683 --> 00:07:32,642
(I didn't expect the idol drama plot would actually happen to me.)

114
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:03,810
Ting Ting. I received the admission notice from Junheng.

115
00:08:03,898 --> 00:08:06,569
It's Junheng, my dream firm!

116
00:08:07,802 --> 00:08:10,364
Just now, I sent you a photo of the apartment complex I just rented.

117
00:08:10,388 --> 00:08:12,459
It has two bedrooms and one living room. It's close to Junheng.

118
00:08:12,483 --> 00:08:15,283
When the time comes, I'll find a housemate to share the rent. Perfect.

119
00:08:28,961 --> 00:08:30,351
(Isn't it that person?)

120
00:08:30,855 --> 00:08:32,334
(With such a high hourly wage, )

121
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:34,806
(why is he still living in this kind of apartment complex?)

122
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:51,831
Oh man, I'm so tired.

123
00:08:58,104 --> 00:08:59,402
I need to take a break.

124
00:09:02,897 --> 00:09:04,937
This place is good. It's just that there's no lift.

125
00:09:21,624 --> 00:09:23,614
(Is this some kind of idol drama scene?)

126
00:09:24,414 --> 00:09:26,974
(The male and female leads live in the same apartment building.)

127
00:09:40,561 --> 00:09:41,662
You don't

128
00:09:42,801 --> 00:09:44,122
live here too, do you?

129
00:09:44,221 --> 00:09:46,061
Get out of the way if you don't want to go up.

130
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,122
You're just rich, all right?

131
00:09:57,206 --> 00:09:58,596
You don't have to be arrogant.

132
00:09:59,601 --> 00:10:01,067
You're still living here, after all.

133
00:10:05,462 --> 00:10:07,962
Wait.

134
00:10:10,072 --> 00:10:12,512
This is the unit I just rented today. Are you lost?

135
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:14,996
It must be you who got lost.

136
00:10:53,441 --> 00:10:54,703
You encountered a double renting.

137
00:10:54,727 --> 00:10:56,042
Go find the agent for a refund.

138
00:10:57,129 --> 00:10:59,489
You also encountered it. Why don't you go ask for a refund?

139
00:11:02,025 --> 00:11:04,054
You want to occupy it first? Dream on.

140
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,477
(Regarding double renting, )

141
00:11:17,501 --> 00:11:19,841
(whoever legally occupies the house first wins.)

142
00:11:22,647 --> 00:11:24,482
So...

143
00:11:25,303 --> 00:11:28,101
Did you sign the rental contract and register it?

144
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:31,021
Did you do it?

145
00:11:33,362 --> 00:11:35,762
Take out the contract and have a look at the time of rental.

146
00:11:38,348 --> 00:11:40,179
You sure know your stuff.

147
00:11:45,481 --> 00:11:46,871
It's the same time.

148
00:11:50,481 --> 00:11:51,481
The landlord.

149
00:11:51,856 --> 00:11:53,165
The landlord is here.

150
00:11:54,569 --> 00:11:55,959
The landlord is really here.

151
00:12:26,762 --> 00:12:28,962
My hair... My hair went in first.

152
00:12:34,315 --> 00:12:36,002
This unit is mine now.

153
00:12:39,764 --> 00:12:40,802
Goodbye.

154
00:12:48,146 --> 00:12:49,228
It's so big.

155
00:13:01,695 --> 00:13:03,162
It even has a balcony.

156
00:13:05,153 --> 00:13:06,442
It's so pretty.

157
00:13:11,751 --> 00:13:14,242
How could you just enter my house like that?

158
00:13:15,397 --> 00:13:16,825
I'll give you two months of rent.

159
00:13:16,992 --> 00:13:18,482
You find a better place to move to.

160
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,630
Why?

161
00:13:19,711 --> 00:13:20,791
I have to stay here.

162
00:13:20,872 --> 00:13:22,622
I have to stay here too!

163
00:13:23,421 --> 00:13:26,122
I'm telling you, you can't win against me. I'm a lawyer.

164
00:13:26,812 --> 00:13:28,852
My consultation fee starts from 1,000 yuan an hour.

165
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,562
I'm calling the landlord right now.

166
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,082
Hello, landlord.

167
00:13:34,252 --> 00:13:35,362
I'm going to buy this unit.

168
00:13:35,513 --> 00:13:36,842
You're breaking the rules!

169
00:13:38,062 --> 00:13:39,062
Yes.

170
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,961
Lawyer Cheng. Maybe you can just move out.

171
00:13:43,096 --> 00:13:44,882
No way, landlord.

172
00:13:46,174 --> 00:13:47,934
You're double renting. This is already illegal.

173
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,402
Now, you're forcing me to move out.

174
00:13:50,064 --> 00:13:51,842
This violates my legal rights.

175
00:13:53,353 --> 00:13:54,482
Do you know Junheng & Co?

176
00:13:54,571 --> 00:13:56,812
My boss, Junheng, is a big shot in the legal world.

177
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,242
He never loses a case.

178
00:13:58,353 --> 00:14:01,063
Plus, he likes me. He won't just stand by and watch me get bullied by you.

179
00:14:01,087 --> 00:14:02,147
Right.

180
00:14:03,451 --> 00:14:07,111
If you insist on me moving out, then we'll have to go to court.

181
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:11,641
As a lawyer, I will fight for my rights until the very end.

182
00:14:11,721 --> 00:14:13,481
Oh, wait. That makes sense.

183
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,202
It does make sense.

184
00:14:15,411 --> 00:14:17,042
Miss Cheng, all right?

185
00:14:17,762 --> 00:14:19,001
To be honest,

186
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,802
look at what I'm dealing with.

187
00:14:22,522 --> 00:14:24,562
My wife is divorcing me.

188
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,417
I rented the house to you without her knowing.

189
00:14:27,441 --> 00:14:30,672
Then, she rented the house to this gentleman here. It's all our fault.

190
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,682
What about this? I have a way to have the best of both worlds.

191
00:14:34,135 --> 00:14:36,442
Think about it. In this vast sea of people,

192
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,680
you two meeting is a kind of fate.

193
00:14:39,073 --> 00:14:40,602
Trust in my judgment.

194
00:14:41,112 --> 00:14:43,922
Look at him. He's so elegant and handsome.

195
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:45,245
In 20 years,

196
00:14:45,354 --> 00:14:47,361
his connections and your connections

197
00:14:47,495 --> 00:14:49,486
will make a great network.

198
00:14:49,838 --> 00:14:53,182
All right, that's settled. I'll give you guys a discount on the rent.

199
00:14:54,211 --> 00:14:55,602
Why don't you two share the rent?

200
00:14:59,682 --> 00:15:01,497
- I can do that. - What do you mean by "can do"?

201
00:15:01,521 --> 00:15:04,706
I can't do that. How can I live with a stranger man?

202
00:15:04,787 --> 00:15:05,882
Lawyer Cheng.

203
00:15:05,963 --> 00:15:07,953
You didn't listen to me properly.

204
00:15:08,362 --> 00:15:10,482
My wife and I are going through a divorce now.

205
00:15:10,588 --> 00:15:13,738
We are currently in need of a divorce lawyer.

206
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:18,018
Think of the kind of fate you have with this house.

207
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,304
Your first pot of gold in life

208
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:20,682
is already in front of you.

209
00:15:20,762 --> 00:15:22,557
Landlord, you've found the right person.

210
00:15:22,651 --> 00:15:24,812
Let me tell you, Junheng & Co specializes in handling

211
00:15:24,893 --> 00:15:26,937
these kinds of family matters. We're very professional.

212
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:29,961
- If you have any questions, feel free to come to me. - Happy co-renting.

213
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,016
- Happy cooperation. - Let's make it so.

214
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,400
- All right then. - Happy cooperation.

215
00:15:33,424 --> 00:15:35,284
- Happy co-living. - Happy cooperation.

216
00:15:35,605 --> 00:15:37,316
What does that mean?

217
00:15:42,803 --> 00:15:43,819
You should go now.

218
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,099
I just agreed to do the landlord's business, not to co-live with you.

219
00:15:47,234 --> 00:15:48,914
You said you work at Junheng & Co.

220
00:15:49,096 --> 00:15:50,116
What's wrong?

221
00:15:51,757 --> 00:15:52,882
Are you scared?

222
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,001
Okay then. I'll give you two months of rent.

223
00:15:56,217 --> 00:15:57,737
I'll borrow your house for three days.

224
00:15:57,803 --> 00:16:00,243
Regarding other matters, let's talk about them in three days.

225
00:16:01,523 --> 00:16:02,802
Three days?

226
00:16:02,889 --> 00:16:03,988
Just three days.

227
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:14,402
We agreed on three days. Not a day more.

228
00:16:14,615 --> 00:16:15,615
Deal.

229
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:23,913
That's a lot.

230
00:16:24,136 --> 00:16:25,576
I've given you three months of rent.

231
00:16:46,681 --> 00:16:50,155
So... Although I agree that you'll stay here for three days,

232
00:16:50,251 --> 00:16:52,922
there are still some things we need to clarify.

233
00:16:53,147 --> 00:16:54,282
What else do you want to do?

234
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:57,522
For the next three days, we have to abide by three rules.

235
00:16:59,067 --> 00:17:01,671
First, you can't disturb my schedule.

236
00:17:01,762 --> 00:17:03,055
Second, you can't show your body.

237
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:04,079
Third,

238
00:17:04,613 --> 00:17:06,163
and most importantly,

239
00:17:09,008 --> 00:17:10,527
you can't bring others home.

240
00:17:10,608 --> 00:17:12,322
Otherwise, I'll report you.

241
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,840
What did you say? Report me?

242
00:17:17,681 --> 00:17:20,882
Your work is not very honorable, right?

243
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:28,340
People like you should prefer to live alone, right?

244
00:17:28,421 --> 00:17:29,891
Why did you agree to co-rent?

245
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,740
It can't be that

246
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:36,841
you made your first fortune here, right?

247
00:17:37,811 --> 00:17:40,231
So, you did make your first fortune here.

248
00:17:40,443 --> 00:17:42,362
Is that why you had to come back?

249
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:43,642
I'm really too...

250
00:17:43,805 --> 00:17:45,114
So, here is where you...

251
00:17:47,464 --> 00:17:48,774
What do you mean?

252
00:17:49,642 --> 00:17:51,898
I've recorded what you said and will sue you for slandering me.

253
00:17:51,922 --> 00:17:53,242
Don't be nervous.

254
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,711
I respect you.

255
00:17:57,883 --> 00:18:00,322
But, I'll give you a piece of advice too.

256
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,256
You should get back on the right track soon.

257
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:03,880
Look at you,

258
00:18:03,981 --> 00:18:06,282
so young and good-looking.

259
00:18:06,602 --> 00:18:10,482
Although you can make money with your looks,

260
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,611
your behavior can easily

261
00:18:13,874 --> 00:18:17,785
violate the Public Security Administration Punishment Law.

262
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:19,911
It's true.

263
00:18:20,451 --> 00:18:21,610
You shouldn't doubt me.

264
00:18:21,713 --> 00:18:23,234
I'm worried about you.

265
00:18:23,315 --> 00:18:24,394
What if you get caught?

266
00:18:24,481 --> 00:18:26,561
Then, you'll not be able to find a proper job later.

267
00:18:26,591 --> 00:18:27,772
That's not worth it.

268
00:18:30,714 --> 00:18:31,722
Okay.

269
00:18:31,837 --> 00:18:33,362
You should think it through yourself.

270
00:18:35,326 --> 00:18:36,547
It's not too late to repent.

271
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:05,330
Perfect.

272
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:13,501
(There won't be any problems living with this kind of person, right?)

273
00:19:16,016 --> 00:19:18,207
He paid so generously,

274
00:19:18,727 --> 00:19:20,327
there couldn't be any conspiracy, right?

275
00:20:21,272 --> 00:20:23,322
Is there something wrong with this person?

276
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:28,162
He turned his bedroom into a haunted house.

277
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,081
The reason he agrees to co-rent with me

278
00:20:30,602 --> 00:20:33,282
isn't so that I can help him block the bad luck, right?

279
00:20:36,406 --> 00:20:37,666
Oh, no.

280
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:40,362
I should just give him the money back.

281
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:49,401
(Oh my gosh, dear.)

282
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:51,471
(You finally came online.)

283
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,882
- (Let me tell you...) - (He's quite dedicated, )

284
00:20:55,076 --> 00:20:57,122
(staying up late to voice chat.)

285
00:20:57,383 --> 00:20:58,802
(He's just a scoundrel.)

286
00:20:59,071 --> 00:21:01,082
(He only agreed to give me a villa.)

287
00:21:01,203 --> 00:21:04,161
Mrs. Wang. I need to know more about this.

288
00:21:04,438 --> 00:21:07,441
Last December 3rd, at 10 o'clock at night, you were at the New City Hotel.

289
00:21:07,536 --> 00:21:08,836
What exactly did you do?

290
00:21:10,023 --> 00:21:11,533
(Oh, now he's jealous.)

291
00:21:13,321 --> 00:21:15,201
(It was just a friends gathering.)

292
00:21:15,327 --> 00:21:18,042
Mrs. Wang. I need to know the truth.

293
00:21:18,922 --> 00:21:20,162
This is an information society.

294
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:22,571
I can find out about you through legal means.

295
00:21:22,652 --> 00:21:24,242
Your husband can too.

296
00:21:24,508 --> 00:21:28,162
If your husband gets the evidence first, then you won't even get the villa.

297
00:21:29,143 --> 00:21:31,122
(Listen to me.)

298
00:21:31,774 --> 00:21:33,513
(I'm a woman too.)

299
00:21:33,614 --> 00:21:35,740
(I need love too.)

300
00:21:35,821 --> 00:21:37,602
That's not within our scope of discussion.

301
00:21:37,938 --> 00:21:40,059
But, I will still provide you with a maximized benefit plan

302
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,922
based on procedural justice.

303
00:21:42,063 --> 00:21:44,441
(Can I trust you then?)

304
00:21:44,522 --> 00:21:46,162
Marriage doesn't protect love,

305
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,682
but it does protect property.

306
00:21:48,547 --> 00:21:50,538
(Now, public relations work is getting real competitive, huh?)

307
00:21:50,562 --> 00:21:53,122
(Not only does he have to chat, but also provides legal advice.)

308
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:55,082
(He sounds professional too.)

309
00:21:58,822 --> 00:21:59,922
What are you doing?

310
00:22:02,344 --> 00:22:05,064
I just heard you talking about law in the chat. You're professional.

311
00:22:05,091 --> 00:22:06,671
Maybe you should quit this line of work.

312
00:22:06,695 --> 00:22:09,122
Take advantage of your youth and good memory now.

313
00:22:09,225 --> 00:22:10,722
Why don't you take the judicial exam?

314
00:22:10,904 --> 00:22:13,053
Maybe in two years, you can even surpass me.

315
00:22:15,783 --> 00:22:17,063
If you don't want to, forget it.

316
00:22:18,095 --> 00:22:19,962
So, I wanted to tell you

317
00:22:20,641 --> 00:22:22,063
I don't want to lend you the unit anymore.

318
00:22:22,087 --> 00:22:23,642
Can I return the rent to you?

319
00:22:24,031 --> 00:22:26,265
The money has been collected. The contract has been fulfilled.

320
00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:27,664
If you breach it, you have to pay a penalty.

321
00:22:27,688 --> 00:22:29,482
You are a lawyer. Don't you know this?

322
00:22:32,466 --> 00:22:35,106
Don't violate my privacy anymore. Otherwise, I'll call the police.

323
00:22:35,141 --> 00:22:37,501
So from now on, you have to sanitize the bath towel, towel,

324
00:22:37,536 --> 00:22:39,122
toilet, bathroom, etc. that you use.

325
00:22:39,203 --> 00:22:41,419
You also can't stay in the bathroom for more than an hour.

326
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,242
- Is that okay? - Are we done?

327
00:22:43,438 --> 00:22:47,282
- Do you want to come in and count the time? - Wait. Watch your words.

328
00:22:52,922 --> 00:22:54,082
What do you want to do now?

329
00:22:54,162 --> 00:22:55,282
Disinfect.

330
00:22:55,362 --> 00:22:57,762
Since you're not leaving, I have to disinfect every day.

331
00:22:57,842 --> 00:22:58,842
I'm scared.

332
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,860
Just disinfecting isn't enough.

333
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,680
You need to find some detergent and scrub the whole toilet.

334
00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:10,300
Don't forget the corners.

335
00:23:21,201 --> 00:23:22,222
What now?

336
00:23:22,436 --> 00:23:24,362
(Qian, so, how are you doing?)

337
00:23:24,492 --> 00:23:26,492
(Is returning to entrepreneurship comforting?)

338
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:30,084
Let me tell you. I consulted a neurologist about it.

339
00:23:30,186 --> 00:23:31,737
They said your insomnia

340
00:23:31,818 --> 00:23:34,245
would be best cured by returning to an environment

341
00:23:34,326 --> 00:23:35,388
where you used to sleep well.

342
00:23:35,412 --> 00:23:38,173
So, I specially arranged the place where we used to start a business.

343
00:23:38,219 --> 00:23:41,762
Come on, tell me. What are these things for then?

344
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:45,075
(Well, it's indeed a bit of a mess. Let me introduce each thing to you.)

345
00:23:45,171 --> 00:23:47,331
(The one next to you is a white crystal energy array.)

346
00:23:47,522 --> 00:23:49,538
(The one on the right is a dragon-turtle ornament.)

347
00:23:49,562 --> 00:23:50,737
(And the wooden carving behind?)

348
00:23:50,761 --> 00:23:52,683
(I had it specially made for you in Nepal.)

349
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,321
(It's a peace-of-mind wooden carving. All of these)

350
00:23:54,345 --> 00:23:55,665
(can help you with your sleep.)

351
00:23:56,553 --> 00:23:58,333
Is the fact that I can't sleep bothering you?

352
00:23:58,357 --> 00:23:59,482
I can work day and night.

353
00:23:59,566 --> 00:24:00,723
Just consider yourself lucky!

354
00:24:00,747 --> 00:24:02,907
(I hope you can get some good sleep and act normally.)

355
00:24:02,998 --> 00:24:05,358
(That will help with the long-term development of Junheng.)

356
00:24:05,498 --> 00:24:07,962
(Also, I recruited a female for your team.)

357
00:24:08,043 --> 00:24:10,363
(I've seen her resume. She'll be coming to work tomorrow.)

358
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,750
No way.

359
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:13,413
I don't want a female assistant.

360
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:14,753
But, I like one.

361
00:24:15,511 --> 00:24:17,042
No. I mean...

362
00:24:17,974 --> 00:24:19,339
I think this female assistant

363
00:24:19,474 --> 00:24:22,834
has an important role in balancing the male thinking of your team.

364
00:24:23,021 --> 00:24:26,487
(So, I hope Junheng's highest goal this year is)

365
00:24:26,568 --> 00:24:28,802
to obtain the Golden Scale Award from the Law Association.

366
00:24:28,826 --> 00:24:30,282
I refuse again.

367
00:24:30,795 --> 00:24:31,842
All right then.

368
00:24:31,935 --> 00:24:34,764
If you think it's not important, then let's just split up.

369
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:36,487
You can screen the cases,

370
00:24:36,568 --> 00:24:40,162
handle the after-sales and maintain your law firm's image all by yourself.

371
00:24:40,267 --> 00:24:41,408
That won't do.

372
00:24:41,795 --> 00:24:43,195
I'm only responsible for the cases.

373
00:24:43,326 --> 00:24:44,842
I'm not denying your work.

374
00:24:44,935 --> 00:24:47,116
So, you should listen to me obediently. Cooperate with my work.

375
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,489
Obey my leadership.

376
00:24:48,748 --> 00:24:51,190
After all, Junheng has "Jun" in front.

377
00:24:51,271 --> 00:24:53,122
I'm the one in charge. Understand?

378
00:24:53,334 --> 00:24:54,400
Okay, go to sleep.

379
00:24:54,842 --> 00:24:56,311
(Good boy, trust me.)

380
00:24:56,506 --> 00:24:58,946
(You will definitely be able to sleep well tonight. Goodbye.)

381
00:25:13,614 --> 00:25:14,834
I believe

382
00:25:15,544 --> 00:25:17,184
I will definitely be able to fall asleep.

383
00:26:27,353 --> 00:26:28,863
(I actually fell asleep?)

384
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,019
Wu Jun's method is quite useful.

385
00:27:11,251 --> 00:27:13,042
(So, he got me a female assistant.)

386
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,610
Junheng & Co currently has five partners

387
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:30,946
and 32 practicing lawyers.

388
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,706
With our admins, the total headcount is 40 people.

389
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:33,962
It's a boutique law firm.

390
00:27:34,082 --> 00:27:36,362
Among the partners, there are two responsible for the main decisions.

391
00:27:36,386 --> 00:27:38,026
One is Qian Heng and the other is Wu Jun.

392
00:27:38,141 --> 00:27:41,201
The name Junheng is also named after these two bosses.

393
00:27:41,321 --> 00:27:43,442
But, you may not often see Lawyer Wu in the firm

394
00:27:43,523 --> 00:27:46,139
as he usually handles external business contacts and media relations.

395
00:27:46,163 --> 00:27:47,562
He is always on the go.

396
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:52,315
In the photo on the wall are the five partners I just mentioned.

397
00:27:54,314 --> 00:27:55,802
(Qian Heng, Wu Jun)

398
00:27:56,899 --> 00:27:58,962
Lawyer Qian didn't really like taking such a photo.

399
00:27:59,047 --> 00:28:00,927
He felt it was an insult to their intelligence.

400
00:28:01,022 --> 00:28:02,973
So, he just scolded everyone?

401
00:28:04,157 --> 00:28:07,023
Lawyer Wu felt that not taking a photo was an insult to their intelligence.

402
00:28:07,047 --> 00:28:09,261
That's how they are, like fire and ice.

403
00:28:09,992 --> 00:28:10,992
Come on.

404
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:15,042
Everyone calls this money tree the Firm's Holy Tree.

405
00:28:15,992 --> 00:28:17,722
The name is quite cute.

406
00:28:18,258 --> 00:28:19,755
Come on. Your workstation is over here.

407
00:28:19,779 --> 00:28:20,802
Okay.

408
00:28:20,882 --> 00:28:24,161
Generally, new employees will have a one-month probation period.

409
00:28:24,273 --> 00:28:25,353
After the probation period,

410
00:28:25,433 --> 00:28:26,433
if they perform well,

411
00:28:26,521 --> 00:28:29,121
there will be a mentor to lead them to their own team.

412
00:28:29,352 --> 00:28:30,882
But, you are lucky.

413
00:28:30,963 --> 00:28:32,217
Lawyer Qian looked at your resume

414
00:28:32,241 --> 00:28:34,642
and ordered you to enter his team for probation directly.

415
00:28:34,761 --> 00:28:36,122
Lawyer Qian Heng?

416
00:28:36,223 --> 00:28:37,322
Really?

417
00:28:39,086 --> 00:28:42,602
However, I don't know if I should say you're lucky or unlucky.

418
00:28:42,719 --> 00:28:46,061
Anyway, you'll soon find out your boss's style.

419
00:28:46,864 --> 00:28:48,522
- Welcome aboard. - Thank you.

420
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:56,602
Let's see who won the boss's five million bonus.

421
00:28:57,972 --> 00:28:59,242
Hi, I'm Cheng Yao.

422
00:28:59,346 --> 00:29:01,226
You are all from the Lawyer Qian's team, right?

423
00:29:01,958 --> 00:29:03,841
Hi. Bao Rui.

424
00:29:04,082 --> 00:29:05,425
The boss trusts me

425
00:29:05,508 --> 00:29:07,706
as one of the best assistants in the whole law firm.

426
00:29:07,873 --> 00:29:09,745
I'm another one. My name is Yu Fei.

427
00:29:09,827 --> 00:29:12,486
- Hello. - I hope I can stay with you longer.

428
00:29:12,979 --> 00:29:14,963
Longer? Why?

429
00:29:15,104 --> 00:29:17,198
Before you, Lawyer Qian has already consecutively dismissed

430
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:18,681
13 assistants and interns.

431
00:29:18,792 --> 00:29:20,441
The first got the law wrong.

432
00:29:20,565 --> 00:29:22,818
The second couldn't finish the legal documents in one day.

433
00:29:22,842 --> 00:29:24,602
The third called the plaintiff's name wrong.

434
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:26,963
- The fourth failed... - Do you need to list them all, Yu Fei?

435
00:29:26,987 --> 00:29:30,082
In short, our boss is a devil.

436
00:29:30,651 --> 00:29:33,162
It's not that bad. They did make mistakes.

437
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:35,650
Saying this means you don't understand our boss very well.

438
00:29:35,674 --> 00:29:39,074
His coldness is like minus 20 degrees in the North.

439
00:29:39,393 --> 00:29:43,276
But, as the boss's most trusted assistant, I will be strict with you.

440
00:29:43,378 --> 00:29:46,362
- After all, I'm shouldering the future of Junheng. - No problem.

441
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:48,149
I can see you are Junheng's trash.

442
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,722
"Shouldering the future of Junheng"?

443
00:29:49,878 --> 00:29:51,617
You think you're a crown prince waiting to inherit the throne?

444
00:29:51,641 --> 00:29:52,860
Keep it low-key, all right?

445
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,535
Hello, I'm Tan Ying.

446
00:29:54,648 --> 00:29:56,277
Hello, I'm Cheng Yao.

447
00:29:56,956 --> 00:29:59,339
I heard you were coming, so I specially went to get a money tree for you

448
00:29:59,363 --> 00:30:00,762
as a welcome gift.

449
00:30:01,104 --> 00:30:02,143
Will this be useful?

450
00:30:02,224 --> 00:30:05,562
It's for a newbie, so consider it a lucky charm. It's good for your health.

451
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,739
Oh, this is your milk tea.

452
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:09,242
Thanks.

453
00:30:09,354 --> 00:30:10,739
Remember to come to me if you're ever wronged.

454
00:30:10,763 --> 00:30:11,812
And, don't listen to them.

455
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:14,964
Although our bosses are harsh,

456
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,042
Junheng's overtime benefits are still quite good.

457
00:30:18,152 --> 00:30:20,654
The gym, shower room, and small kitchen are all available.

458
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:22,575
But, you probably won't have time to use them.

459
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,842
Isn't this a female colleague?

460
00:30:28,416 --> 00:30:29,416
She doesn't count.

461
00:30:29,497 --> 00:30:30,994
I'm not from the same team as them.

462
00:30:31,075 --> 00:30:32,722
I'm from the Wu Jun's team.

463
00:30:32,822 --> 00:30:34,681
Our boss specifically asked me to be here

464
00:30:34,761 --> 00:30:36,001
to keep an eye on these singles

465
00:30:36,049 --> 00:30:38,762
so they don't make any gender mistakes they shouldn't,

466
00:30:38,857 --> 00:30:41,042
like offending rich ladies.

467
00:30:46,023 --> 00:30:48,403
But, there's one thing I'm really curious about.

468
00:30:49,322 --> 00:30:52,202
What kind of curse did you get

469
00:30:52,322 --> 00:30:55,112
that made Mr. Qian personally pick you?

470
00:30:55,768 --> 00:30:57,358
That sounds serious.

471
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:00,802
But, it's okay. I'm new here.

472
00:31:00,882 --> 00:31:03,862
Having a stricter mentor is a good thing for me.

473
00:31:04,961 --> 00:31:06,392
You're still too young.

474
00:31:06,575 --> 00:31:08,802
Let's do it this way. I'll show you the boss's secret.

475
00:31:08,882 --> 00:31:10,242
The boss's secret?

476
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,530
What secret?

477
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,214
Come on. Take a look.

478
00:31:15,521 --> 00:31:19,273
This small room is where the boss's spoils are stored.

479
00:31:20,719 --> 00:31:22,402
Are these all his?

480
00:31:24,078 --> 00:31:25,322
These too?

481
00:31:26,309 --> 00:31:27,554
So, everyone should like the boss.

482
00:31:27,578 --> 00:31:29,218
Why do you guys talk about him like that?

483
00:31:29,726 --> 00:31:30,886
Don't just look at this side.

484
00:31:30,967 --> 00:31:32,027
Take a look at this side.

485
00:31:38,241 --> 00:31:40,872
There are so many threatening letters and threatening objects.

486
00:31:41,642 --> 00:31:44,471
No wonder Junheng never got the Golden Scale Award.

487
00:31:47,123 --> 00:31:49,082
It's considered great if he isn't assassinated.

488
00:31:49,232 --> 00:31:52,292
Actually, it's been discussed online as well.

489
00:31:53,327 --> 00:31:55,802
So, is the boss keeping these as a reminder to himself?

490
00:31:57,381 --> 00:31:58,862
In case these people take revenge,

491
00:31:58,997 --> 00:32:02,282
these threats will be evidence to convict them.

492
00:32:03,001 --> 00:32:04,001
Boss.

493
00:32:08,975 --> 00:32:10,154
How coincident!

494
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:13,042
- Do you know him? - No.

495
00:32:13,176 --> 00:32:14,355
Why don't you know?

496
00:32:14,681 --> 00:32:15,841
We discussed the legal issues

497
00:32:15,896 --> 00:32:19,156
regarding double renting in-depth, right? Lawyer Cheng.

498
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:24,318
Bao Rui.

499
00:32:24,761 --> 00:32:26,042
File this away.

500
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:28,032
This is from the last family trust dispute case.

501
00:32:28,056 --> 00:32:29,736
The other party sent a threatening letter.

502
00:32:30,192 --> 00:32:31,412
Okay. Leave it to me.

503
00:32:33,736 --> 00:32:36,136
Put it on the outside. Recently, they just lost the lawsuit.

504
00:32:36,217 --> 00:32:37,217
They may cause trouble.

505
00:32:39,309 --> 00:32:40,469
If you like "snakes" so much,

506
00:32:40,554 --> 00:32:41,985
I'll give you a real one tomorrow.

507
00:32:42,704 --> 00:32:43,925
You. Come here.

508
00:32:47,564 --> 00:32:48,564
I'm done.

509
00:32:52,362 --> 00:32:53,382
I'm done too.

510
00:32:53,465 --> 00:32:55,482
Why are you slacking?

511
00:32:57,382 --> 00:33:00,722
(Qian Heng)

512
00:33:01,583 --> 00:33:02,894
Do you have anything to say?

513
00:33:03,684 --> 00:33:05,882
Boss, I'm narrow-minded. My perspective is small. I'm a frog in the well.

514
00:33:05,906 --> 00:33:08,602
I'm short-sighted. Can we split the rent equally?

515
00:33:08,681 --> 00:33:10,121
I'm really in a difficult situation.

516
00:33:10,247 --> 00:33:11,251
I don't want to use force

517
00:33:11,332 --> 00:33:13,027
to take away the rights you have worked so hard for.

518
00:33:13,051 --> 00:33:14,202
So, are you grateful to me?

519
00:33:14,311 --> 00:33:16,061
Boss, you're very nice.

520
00:33:18,006 --> 00:33:20,606
It was really my fault for not recognizing your greatness before.

521
00:33:20,747 --> 00:33:23,762
- Sorry. - But, as a premise of respecting each other,

522
00:33:23,934 --> 00:33:26,562
I hope you can respect my habits, and we won't bother each other.

523
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:28,672
Of course. Boss, don't worry.

524
00:33:28,827 --> 00:33:30,696
I'm a very sensible person.

525
00:33:32,402 --> 00:33:33,601
What I mean is

526
00:33:33,704 --> 00:33:36,285
we will have a lot of opportunities to work together in the future.

527
00:33:36,309 --> 00:33:38,922
I hope you can keep your own bottom line. Hold yourself back.

528
00:33:39,325 --> 00:33:40,572
"Hold myself back"?

529
00:33:40,653 --> 00:33:41,821
What does that mean?

530
00:33:42,317 --> 00:33:44,082
I know I'm very charming,

531
00:33:44,163 --> 00:33:46,417
but work is work, especially between superiors and subordinates.

532
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:49,244
If some feelings arise, it will affect the work.

533
00:33:49,325 --> 00:33:50,845
And this would be very unprofessional.

534
00:33:50,887 --> 00:33:53,042
Before you, 13 assistants were all dismissed

535
00:33:53,123 --> 00:33:54,722
due to these unprofessional behaviors.

536
00:33:56,575 --> 00:33:57,835
Do you have any questions?

537
00:33:58,562 --> 00:33:59,741
No questions.

538
00:34:03,242 --> 00:34:06,202
Oh, right. Boss. You're so wealthy. Why do you stay there?

539
00:34:09,652 --> 00:34:11,403
Are you violating my privacy?

540
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:14,659
I'm just curious.

541
00:34:15,075 --> 00:34:17,242
Why do you think I'm engaged in special service?

542
00:34:17,384 --> 00:34:18,523
Because I'm blind.

543
00:34:22,081 --> 00:34:25,442
Two days ago, when I was eating at a restaurant,

544
00:34:25,629 --> 00:34:27,282
I saw a wealthy customer

545
00:34:27,363 --> 00:34:29,018
saying she would pay you a huge hourly wage

546
00:34:29,042 --> 00:34:30,379
to accompany her for meals and shopping.

547
00:34:30,403 --> 00:34:33,083
- She was close to you and even leaned toward... - That's my mom.

548
00:34:37,998 --> 00:34:39,330
Oh, it's really like a drama.

549
00:34:47,808 --> 00:34:49,277
Stop laughing.

550
00:34:50,065 --> 00:34:51,162
(You...)

551
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:52,602
Do you have a conscience?

552
00:34:53,645 --> 00:34:55,521
(Wait. Such an outdated joke)

553
00:34:55,601 --> 00:34:56,842
(actually applies to reality.)

554
00:34:56,922 --> 00:34:58,236
(That's not scientific.)

555
00:34:58,317 --> 00:35:00,562
You know that boss from our old law firm

556
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,962
(was like a dog in front of his clients, right?)

557
00:35:03,145 --> 00:35:04,961
(Is Qian Heng that domineering?)

558
00:35:05,041 --> 00:35:08,002
It's expected considering he is Junheng's partner.

559
00:35:09,897 --> 00:35:11,481
Oh, right. What about you?

560
00:35:11,561 --> 00:35:12,781
Have you found a job?

561
00:35:14,748 --> 00:35:15,788
(I'm not looking anymore.)

562
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,661
(Hao Zi said he would take care of me.)

563
00:35:17,763 --> 00:35:20,950
(And, I actually have some good news to tell you today.)

564
00:35:21,051 --> 00:35:22,242
(I'm pregnant.)

565
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,789
(It's twins.)

566
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:25,762
Really?

567
00:35:26,027 --> 00:35:27,377
You're going to be a mom.

568
00:35:27,802 --> 00:35:29,281
(We just found out.)

569
00:35:29,385 --> 00:35:31,095
(It's been two months already.)

570
00:35:31,434 --> 00:35:33,282
And, it's twins.

571
00:35:35,471 --> 00:35:38,602
So, what about the marriage between you and Hao Zi?

572
00:35:42,222 --> 00:35:43,522
(What sound is that?)

573
00:35:45,415 --> 00:35:46,725
I don't know either.

574
00:35:47,317 --> 00:35:51,427
Qian Heng's room has some strange things and all kinds of weird stuff.

575
00:35:51,508 --> 00:35:52,762
I can't make sense of them.

576
00:35:53,613 --> 00:35:55,642
I don't know if he has any special hobbies.

577
00:35:57,145 --> 00:36:00,122
(Why don't you go take a look while he's not back?)

578
00:36:00,341 --> 00:36:01,818
(In case he doesn't come back tonight, )

579
00:36:01,842 --> 00:36:04,042
you'll be scared to death by the sound.

580
00:36:04,136 --> 00:36:06,339
(Let's talk about my stuff when we meet again.)

581
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,331
I'm hanging up first.

582
00:36:37,367 --> 00:36:39,282
It's so scary late at night.

583
00:37:02,233 --> 00:37:03,682
It's over.

584
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:09,122
Oh my.

585
00:37:33,911 --> 00:37:36,231
What are you doing? What are you doing at my door?

586
00:37:36,489 --> 00:37:38,122
Cleaning.

587
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:44,672
(Ling Yao. You... Why are you so careless?)

588
00:37:45,802 --> 00:37:47,202
Boss.

589
00:37:47,285 --> 00:37:48,818
Do you want to check the living room

590
00:37:48,922 --> 00:37:50,242
and see if it's clean enough?

591
00:37:50,323 --> 00:37:52,622
You can see where else needs to be cleaned.

592
00:37:54,551 --> 00:37:55,602
Boss.

593
00:37:56,169 --> 00:37:57,961
Do you want to watch a drama together?

594
00:37:58,114 --> 00:38:00,002
This drama is quite good.

595
00:38:00,139 --> 00:38:01,439
What's so good about it?

596
00:38:01,927 --> 00:38:03,692
If you have the time, why not review some laws instead?

597
00:38:03,716 --> 00:38:04,739
You're right.

598
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:07,356
This drama features a lot of ancient Chinese punishments.

599
00:38:07,466 --> 00:38:09,941
I'm reviewing Chinese legal history recently.

600
00:38:11,096 --> 00:38:13,167
Do you want to watch it together?

601
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,459
(Concubine Heng.)

602
00:38:17,041 --> 00:38:18,197
(From now on, )

603
00:38:18,278 --> 00:38:20,242
(Ling Yao is my personal palace maid.)

604
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:23,562
(Let's see who dares to trouble her.)

605
00:38:25,096 --> 00:38:27,007
This emperor is so handsome.

606
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:30,494
How so?

607
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:32,126
Because he protects his people.

608
00:38:32,391 --> 00:38:33,431
Boss, look.

609
00:38:33,512 --> 00:38:35,882
The female lead broke his precious porcelain.

610
00:38:35,971 --> 00:38:37,482
But, he didn't blame her

611
00:38:37,786 --> 00:38:38,921
and even protected her.

612
00:38:39,002 --> 00:38:40,392
Isn't that cool?

613
00:38:42,708 --> 00:38:44,401
Boss, thinking about it,

614
00:38:44,637 --> 00:38:46,402
you two look quite alike.

615
00:38:46,483 --> 00:38:48,424
- Ridiculous. - You're right.

616
00:38:49,601 --> 00:38:52,497
This emperor is definitely not as handsome as you.

617
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:53,826
What I mean is

618
00:38:53,942 --> 00:38:56,922
the emperor's domineering attitude to protect the female lead

619
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:59,403
is somewhat similar to you.

620
00:39:01,153 --> 00:39:03,597
Boss, do you usually chase stars?

621
00:39:03,973 --> 00:39:05,799
The female lead of this drama is called Bai Xing Meng.

622
00:39:05,823 --> 00:39:07,298
She is beautiful and has good acting skills.

623
00:39:07,322 --> 00:39:09,671
- In the past few... - I don't chase stars, but stars chase me.

624
00:39:09,695 --> 00:39:11,842
I don't want to waste time and money for others.

625
00:39:11,938 --> 00:39:13,762
I'd rather they pay to talk to me.

626
00:39:13,922 --> 00:39:15,522
It's the same for celebrities.

627
00:39:16,288 --> 00:39:17,682
- So... - Stop the nonsense.

628
00:39:20,687 --> 00:39:22,398
Boss. You've been busy all day.

629
00:39:22,479 --> 00:39:23,479
Are you hungry?

630
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,320
Shall I make some midnight snacks for you?

631
00:39:27,375 --> 00:39:28,642
You're hungry, right?

632
00:39:29,015 --> 00:39:32,642
Let me make some midnight snacks for you. Yangchun noodles or egg soup?

633
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,309
- And egg... - Cheng Yao. I'm warning you.

634
00:39:35,898 --> 00:39:38,282
Don't make the same mistake as my previous assistants.

635
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:39,842
I'm not going to like you.

636
00:39:41,993 --> 00:39:43,383
I'm sorry, boss.

637
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:45,362
Good night, boss.

638
00:39:50,158 --> 00:39:51,522
Cheng Yao!

639
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:58,039
I didn't mean to break your wooden stake.

640
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,639
I'll buy you a new one, okay?

641
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:01,653
Just now, I had to enter your room because

642
00:40:01,747 --> 00:40:03,507
the music suddenly sounded in the room.

643
00:40:03,588 --> 00:40:07,322
I was afraid the neighbors would complain about us.

644
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,379
It was custom-made from abroad.

645
00:40:09,695 --> 00:40:11,210
It took five months from production to customs clearance.

646
00:40:11,234 --> 00:40:12,722
And, it was a gift from my friend.

647
00:40:17,351 --> 00:40:18,351
Well,

648
00:40:19,448 --> 00:40:21,048
I'm also a tenant.

649
00:40:21,129 --> 00:40:23,009
I'm a legitimate tenant too, right?

650
00:40:23,297 --> 00:40:25,492
If you don't like living with me, you can move out.

651
00:40:25,573 --> 00:40:27,802
But, you don't have the right to cast me out.

652
00:40:28,031 --> 00:40:31,041
We are all lawyers. We have to do things according to the law.

653
00:40:31,121 --> 00:40:33,362
But, I'm your boss. I have the right to fire you.

654
00:40:33,558 --> 00:40:35,122
Then, you won't have money to pay rent.

655
00:40:37,384 --> 00:40:38,962
Let me go in and pack up.

656
00:40:42,213 --> 00:40:43,499
I'll find someone to pack for you.

657
00:40:43,523 --> 00:40:45,882
Boss, I know I'm wrong. Give me one more chance.

658
00:40:45,983 --> 00:40:47,510
You have already delayed me for 10 minutes.

659
00:40:47,534 --> 00:40:49,802
Tomorrow, I'll let Zhu deduct it from your salary.

660
00:41:02,205 --> 00:41:04,362
It's too hard to get a car ride here.

661
00:41:16,726 --> 00:41:19,042
I know he wouldn't be so heartless.

662
00:41:19,304 --> 00:41:21,042
Boss! I'm here.

663
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,442
- Why haven't you left yet? - Aren't you...

664
00:41:26,529 --> 00:41:27,649
I'm just passing by running.

665
00:41:27,723 --> 00:41:28,804
Don't think too much.

666
00:41:33,463 --> 00:41:34,643
You haven't ordered a ride?

667
00:41:35,062 --> 00:41:36,162
I'll help you order it.

668
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,960
Done. The license plate number is sent to your phone.

669
00:41:45,992 --> 00:41:47,481
How did you order the ride?

670
00:41:47,718 --> 00:41:50,472
Dear VIP customer, I hope you disappear soon.

671
00:41:51,641 --> 00:41:53,282
How do you know where I'm going?

672
00:41:53,362 --> 00:41:55,962
I don't care where you go, just as long as you stay away from me.

673
00:42:09,101 --> 00:42:10,112
Hello.

674
00:42:14,871 --> 00:42:16,460
Do you need accommodation?

675
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:19,992
Let me think about it. Thank you.

676
00:42:24,405 --> 00:42:26,030
Although our bosses are harsh,

677
00:42:26,148 --> 00:42:28,922
the overtime benefits are still good.

678
00:42:29,041 --> 00:42:31,762
The kitchen, gym, and shower room are all available.

679
00:42:31,858 --> 00:42:33,857
But, you probably won't have time to use them.

680
00:42:34,077 --> 00:42:35,397
(I can just stay at the company.)

681
00:42:46,662 --> 00:42:49,098
(Employee benefits should be fully utilized.)

682
00:42:49,272 --> 00:42:50,628
(It's 368 yuan for a day.)

683
00:42:50,709 --> 00:42:52,829
(It'll take at least a week to look for a new house.)

684
00:42:52,966 --> 00:42:54,602
(I'm still in my probation period.)

685
00:42:54,889 --> 00:42:57,089
(My job is not stable. I can't spend money recklessly.)

686
00:43:09,142 --> 00:43:10,762
(Storeroom)

687
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:15,152
(Surely, there won't be anyone coming here, right?)
