1
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:38,737
(My Boss)

2
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:41,479
(Episode 35)

3
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,962
(I don't want to lose you.)

4
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:45,482
(I want to have a future with you.)

5
00:01:56,537 --> 00:01:58,218
Are you waiting for me to come home?

6
00:01:59,087 --> 00:02:00,307
Come here.

7
00:02:11,288 --> 00:02:13,967
In the past, there was someone waiting for me to come home.

8
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,002
Every time I went home, the lights were on,

9
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,502
as if there was a place in the world

10
00:02:25,155 --> 00:02:26,962
that belonged only to her and me.

11
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,482
Come on. Look at the camera.

12
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,922
(It's so cute.)

13
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,082
(I can give your suggestion of a complete reconciliation a try.)

14
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,580
Good morning, Senior.

15
00:04:19,415 --> 00:04:20,621
Qian Heng promised to help facilitate

16
00:04:20,702 --> 00:04:22,642
the reconciliation between Chen Lin Li and her mother-in-law.

17
00:04:23,345 --> 00:04:26,362
I believe this matter will have a positive outcome with his assistance.

18
00:04:26,823 --> 00:04:28,043
Really?

19
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,720
Great.

20
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,861
It seems like I can finally break free from his curse.

21
00:04:32,561 --> 00:04:33,760
Oh, by the way,

22
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,640
Lawyer Li gave us two new cases.

23
00:04:35,721 --> 00:04:37,202
Let's find time to discuss them.

24
00:04:38,095 --> 00:04:39,840
How about during dinner? We can discuss them while eating.

25
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,681
- What do you think?   - Okay, I'll treat you.

26
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,102
This is to celebrate my getting rid

27
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,276
of Qian Heng's curse.

28
00:04:49,762 --> 00:04:50,762
Hello?

29
00:04:54,447 --> 00:04:56,128
Tonight?

30
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,601
How about tomorrow?

31
00:04:57,681 --> 00:04:59,401
I just made dinner plans with my senior.

32
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:01,082
(And Chen Lin Li is in the hospital now.)

33
00:05:01,142 --> 00:05:02,682
I'm worried that she won't be able to be discharged.

34
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,642
Huang Ran is only available tonight.

35
00:05:05,191 --> 00:05:07,310
But Chen Lin Li's condition is not very good right now.

36
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:09,807
It's okay. I'll take Huang Ran to the hospital to see her.

37
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:12,123
In situations like this, we must strike while the iron is hot.

38
00:05:12,204 --> 00:05:15,061
(I fear Huang Ran might change her mind overnight and not want to see her.)

39
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,500
(Anyway, think it over.)

40
00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:18,282
Okay.

41
00:05:18,441 --> 00:05:20,199
I'll also talk to Chen Lin Li

42
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,208
and see if we can meet at the hospital.

43
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,041
Sorry, Senior.

44
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,599
I have to go to the hospital tonight

45
00:05:27,685 --> 00:05:29,125
so I won't be able to have dinner with you.

46
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,034
It's okay. I knew it.

47
00:05:32,727 --> 00:05:34,968
It's not that easy to break Qian Heng's curse.

48
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:46,870
Lawyer Cheng, could you please take me to meet my mother-in-law?

49
00:05:46,951 --> 00:05:48,032
No rush.

50
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,460
Lawyer Qian is already on the way with your mother-in-law.

51
00:05:53,081 --> 00:05:54,881
Since the accident,

52
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,600
I have been wanting to see my mother-in-law.

53
00:05:58,561 --> 00:06:00,560
After Kai and Ran passed away,

54
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:03,122
she blocked all contact with me.

55
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:04,519
She even thinks

56
00:06:04,646 --> 00:06:07,557
I caused the death of Kai and Ran for the sake of their inheritance.

57
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:13,271
Her nephews and nieces have targeted her money.

58
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:15,727
They have painted me as a ferocious beast

59
00:06:16,693 --> 00:06:19,367
and made my mother-in-law more hostile toward me.

60
00:06:19,561 --> 00:06:21,560
So the chances of reconciliation are diminishing.

61
00:06:23,641 --> 00:06:24,921
But no matter what,

62
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,241
I really want to thank you.

63
00:06:26,321 --> 00:06:27,600
Don't thank me yet.

64
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:30,522
The outcome of the case depends on how well you two can talk.

65
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,193
Even with a settlement, we still need to negotiate inheritance terms.

66
00:06:35,274 --> 00:06:36,482
It's okay.

67
00:06:36,761 --> 00:06:37,960
As long as we get to negotiate,

68
00:06:38,055 --> 00:06:39,275
there will be a chance.

69
00:06:43,681 --> 00:06:44,901
She is here.

70
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,020
Mom.

71
00:08:40,216 --> 00:08:42,055
Thank you for bringing Huang Ran to see her.

72
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:50,402
They won't finish talking for a while.

73
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,032
Do you want to go eat something?

74
00:08:53,342 --> 00:08:55,647
No need. Huang Ran is willing to come to the hospital.

75
00:08:55,728 --> 00:08:57,173
It means there's a breakthrough in the situation.

76
00:08:57,254 --> 00:08:58,474
I want to wait a little longer.

77
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,722
Okay.

78
00:09:10,401 --> 00:09:12,601
Take a rest. Put this coat on.

79
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,940
The hallway is cold.

80
00:09:17,801 --> 00:09:18,920
What do you want to eat?

81
00:09:19,055 --> 00:09:20,275
I'll buy it for you.

82
00:09:20,801 --> 00:09:22,021
Let's have ramen.

83
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,180
Wait a moment.

84
00:09:34,281 --> 00:09:35,600
Chen Lin Li said they finished talking.

85
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,940
We can go in now.

86
00:09:47,081 --> 00:09:48,301
Lawyer Cheng.

87
00:09:49,537 --> 00:09:50,757
Lawyer Qian.

88
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,161
We have all talked it out.

89
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,440
I understand everything now.

90
00:09:57,742 --> 00:09:59,002
Li Li

91
00:10:00,363 --> 00:10:02,242
has suffered so much injustice.

92
00:10:02,814 --> 00:10:04,494
I don't even know what to say.

93
00:10:06,081 --> 00:10:07,301
Lawyer Qian,

94
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,960
thank you so much.

95
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,560
It was you who convinced me to meet with Li Li.

96
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,081
- Thank you.   - Please don't do this.

97
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,007
I really have to thank you all.

98
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,001
Lawyer Cheng, thank you

99
00:10:21,122 --> 00:10:23,320
for giving me and my mother-in-law a chance to talk things out.

100
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:26,083
And thank you too, for resolving this case in this way.

101
00:10:26,231 --> 00:10:27,682
Please don't do this.

102
00:10:28,151 --> 00:10:30,231
We only did what we could.

103
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,960
Lawyer Cheng and Lawyer Qian,

104
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,440
we won't appeal the second trial.

105
00:10:38,176 --> 00:10:40,016
We'll settle out of court.

106
00:10:40,876 --> 00:10:43,876
You guys are the most professional

107
00:10:43,957 --> 00:10:46,842
and compassionate lawyers I've ever met.

108
00:10:46,923 --> 00:10:48,504
Thank you.

109
00:10:48,585 --> 00:10:49,805
Please don't do this.

110
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,870
This case is now closed.

111
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,500
I'll go home first.

112
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,722
Yao Yao.

113
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,499
I...

114
00:11:22,736 --> 00:11:24,176
It's not that I don't want to talk to you.

115
00:11:24,631 --> 00:11:25,870
I'm just reflecting.

116
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,460
Reflecting?

117
00:11:31,127 --> 00:11:32,447
I didn't hear wrong, did I?

118
00:11:35,398 --> 00:11:37,362
All the marriage and family cases I've handled

119
00:11:37,733 --> 00:11:39,734
are filled with hatred and arguments.

120
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,282
This is the first case that ended in such a gentle way.

121
00:11:45,201 --> 00:11:48,122
I'm thinking if I had met you earlier,

122
00:11:49,114 --> 00:11:51,800
maybe I would have more respect and understanding for marriage.

123
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,601
Would the results of those previous cases be different?

124
00:11:55,441 --> 00:11:56,661
I...

125
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,100
Why?

126
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,720
Do you want to be my apprentice?

127
00:12:05,374 --> 00:12:08,761
You truly taught me a lesson in this case.

128
00:12:12,921 --> 00:12:14,040
Yao Yao.

129
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,340
I apologize to you.

130
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,641
When you talked to me about reconciliation before,

131
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:32,013
I made a wrong judgment due to my own biases.

132
00:12:32,253 --> 00:12:34,242
The truth is, you are right.

133
00:12:34,591 --> 00:12:37,990
You have grown faster and better than I imagined.

134
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,630
It makes me feel a sense of mutual understanding.

135
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,740
Yao Yao,

136
00:12:47,525 --> 00:12:50,089
I am willing to see you as a rival.

137
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:54,339
In the near future, we will compete in court.

138
00:13:15,302 --> 00:13:16,902
Before that,

139
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,241
can I give you a ride home?

140
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:25,278
If you don't give me a ride,

141
00:13:25,801 --> 00:13:27,440
are you planning to make me walk back?

142
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,180
What are you looking for?

143
00:13:56,281 --> 00:13:59,041
My car... I parked it here.

144
00:13:59,281 --> 00:14:00,501
The car is gone.

145
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,840
Could it have been towed?

146
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,860
It's a yellow line.

147
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,241
No. I was in a hurry to find you.

148
00:14:07,406 --> 00:14:08,626
Who would have thought...

149
00:14:11,441 --> 00:14:13,680
I was wrong. How about we book a ride?

150
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:15,781
Let's book together.

151
00:14:24,719 --> 00:14:26,078
I shouldn't have jinxed it

152
00:14:26,201 --> 00:14:27,797
by saying we could walk back.

153
00:14:27,878 --> 00:14:29,318
Now, we really have to walk back.

154
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,320
What a coincidence.

155
00:14:32,401 --> 00:14:33,621
There's not a single car nearby.

156
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,940
I'll send you home.

157
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,261
Let's go.

158
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,520
- Why are you laughing?   - Nothing.

159
00:14:45,681 --> 00:14:46,901
What are you laughing at?

160
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:48,619
What are you laughing at?

161
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,121
What's wrong?

162
00:14:56,201 --> 00:14:57,560
Nothing, let's go.

163
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,860
Wait a minute.

164
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,802
What are you doing?

165
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:09,866
I can walk.

166
00:15:09,947 --> 00:15:12,246
Don't simply move. I won't be able to carry you later.

167
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,393
How about you give me a piggyback ride?

168
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,580
Okay.

169
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,820
Come on.

170
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,800
- Am I heavy?   - No.

171
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,820
- Really?   - Really.

172
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,642
Your expression suggests that I might be too heavy.

173
00:16:15,081 --> 00:16:17,282
Now, you can put me down and rest.

174
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,322
Okay.

175
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,180
Cheng Yao.

176
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,940
Let's get married.

177
00:17:04,275 --> 00:17:05,881
Didn't you always say

178
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:08,280
that marriage only brings conflicts and restrictions?

179
00:17:08,384 --> 00:17:09,602
That was before.

180
00:17:09,683 --> 00:17:10,903
Not anymore.

181
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:15,322
Being a family lawyer for so many years,

182
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,909
I have seen too many negative marriages.

183
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:20,076
I used to think that marriage only brings unhappiness

184
00:17:20,157 --> 00:17:21,482
to emotional relationships.

185
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,601
But after meeting you,

186
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,141
I realized that my previous thoughts may not be right.

187
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:30,082
You have given me so many feelings that I have never had before.

188
00:17:30,173 --> 00:17:31,694
It's really wonderful.

189
00:17:35,473 --> 00:17:37,927
But you've been ignoring me these past few days,

190
00:17:38,008 --> 00:17:39,133
and I find it hard to bear.

191
00:17:39,214 --> 00:17:41,654
I don't want to lose you. I want a future with you.

192
00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:44,240
I didn't ignore you.

193
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,081
But I know you're mad at me.

194
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,747
It wasn't until these past two days that I realized

195
00:17:51,828 --> 00:17:54,431
my love for you makes me desperately

196
00:17:54,546 --> 00:17:56,122
want to be closer to you.

197
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,442
At the same time, I unconsciously overprotected you

198
00:17:58,607 --> 00:18:00,946
and hindered your independent choices.

199
00:18:02,313 --> 00:18:04,242
I didn't consider your feelings.

200
00:18:04,487 --> 00:18:08,007
I didn't pay attention to your desire for independence.

201
00:18:08,152 --> 00:18:09,682
Instead, I restrained you.

202
00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:11,869
I'm sorry.

203
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,361
Actually, I also have things to apologize for.

204
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,960
It's not all your fault.

205
00:18:20,881 --> 00:18:23,640
I only realized later on that after being with you,

206
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,081
I became very insecure.

207
00:18:26,224 --> 00:18:28,543
That's why I cared so much about what you said

208
00:18:29,167 --> 00:18:31,322
and even exaggerated and misinterpreted it.

209
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,580
I'm sorry.

210
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:39,922
So, have you forgiven me?

211
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,260
That's great.

212
00:18:46,881 --> 00:18:48,101
That's great.

213
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,544
When I saw them reconcile just now,

214
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,362
I felt a sense of accomplishment.

215
00:19:06,601 --> 00:19:08,562
It's true that pursuing a career is the most fulfilling.

216
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:13,674
Marriage only protects property, not love.

217
00:19:14,608 --> 00:19:16,042
This statement is very true.

218
00:19:16,273 --> 00:19:18,861
I'll write it down when I get home and stick it on my desk.

219
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,780
No.

220
00:19:21,156 --> 00:19:23,501
That was before, not now.

221
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,920
Not getting married is actually a good idea.

222
00:19:26,097 --> 00:19:28,976
This way, we will have more time and energy to do the things we want to do.

223
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,922
- No.   - All right.

224
00:19:31,664 --> 00:19:32,734
Go back and get some rest.

225
00:19:32,815 --> 00:19:34,240
Tomorrow will be a brand new day.

226
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,680
No, then what I said earlier was all for nothing.

227
00:19:37,062 --> 00:19:39,863
No way. I want to bring Wei Zhen Tian back to live with you.

228
00:19:40,609 --> 00:19:43,642
Since you moved out, I am the sole owner of the house.

229
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:45,920
- I'll pay you rent.   - Do you think my place is a hotel?

230
00:19:46,055 --> 00:19:47,755
And you can just come and go as you please?

231
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,040
Let's go.

232
00:19:49,133 --> 00:19:50,575
Your legs are fine now?

233
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,042
They were fine actually.

234
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,360
You're fine, but I have an issue.

235
00:20:07,053 --> 00:20:08,533
(Can't I move back?)

236
00:20:08,816 --> 00:20:10,696
(I don't have any dog supplies here.)

237
00:20:11,266 --> 00:20:12,719
(Even Wei Zhen Tian is protesting.)

238
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,421
(It destroys my house every day.)

239
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,522
(Qian Heng, look at your situation. Not fun, huh?)

240
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,601
- Hello.   - Sir.

241
00:20:43,681 --> 00:20:45,700
Here's your delivery from Miss Cheng.

242
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,740
Thank you.

243
00:21:10,974 --> 00:21:12,562
(Specially for Wei Zhen Tian.)

244
00:21:26,205 --> 00:21:28,297
Qian,

245
00:21:28,499 --> 00:21:30,122
I just love you so much.

246
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,480
Come here, Qian. Give me a hug.

247
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,002
Come on.

248
00:21:36,455 --> 00:21:38,135
Today, you look especially pleasing to the eye.

249
00:21:42,691 --> 00:21:43,962
Let me announce this to everyone.

250
00:21:44,691 --> 00:21:45,962
Junheng & Co has received a commendation

251
00:21:46,043 --> 00:21:48,200
for the outstanding contributions of Chen Lin Li and Huang Ran's case.

252
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,243
After this commendation,

253
00:21:50,324 --> 00:21:53,041
we will surely win the Golden Scale Award.

254
00:21:53,168 --> 00:21:55,121
You are simply the pride of our law firm, Qian.

255
00:21:55,201 --> 00:21:56,421
I'll give you a kiss.

256
00:22:06,004 --> 00:22:09,522
I announce here that those present should not leave tonight.

257
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,482
I'll arrange a seafood feast.

258
00:22:11,564 --> 00:22:13,322
Lawyer Wu, you're handsome.

259
00:22:13,715 --> 00:22:14,760
Lawyer Wu, we love you too.

260
00:22:14,842 --> 00:22:15,920
Lawyer Wu.

261
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,361
Sea urchin.

262
00:22:17,589 --> 00:22:18,789
Why sea urchin?

263
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:21,431
Lawyer Wu is treating. Let's eat western rock lobster or abalone.

264
00:22:25,953 --> 00:22:29,114
(The Law Association's commendation is the biggest affirmation for me.)

265
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,722
(To celebrate your commendation,)

266
00:22:40,899 --> 00:22:42,420
(let's have dinner together tonight.)

267
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:49,924
(My colleagues have already planned to)

268
00:22:50,005 --> 00:22:51,604
(go to a Sichuan restaurant to celebrate.)

269
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,200
(I can't make it.)

270
00:22:57,402 --> 00:22:59,016
(Will Gu Bei Qing be there as well?)

271
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,322
(Of course he will, he's also my colleague.)

272
00:23:06,641 --> 00:23:08,119
Tonight, just order whatever you want.

273
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,679
I'll pay for everything.

274
00:23:15,448 --> 00:23:16,668
Everyone,

275
00:23:17,486 --> 00:23:18,765
the success of this case

276
00:23:18,846 --> 00:23:21,641
cannot be separated from the cooperation with Jincheng & Co.

277
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,710
I believe it's necessary to have more project collaborations

278
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:26,002
with neighboring law firms to achieve win-win situations.

279
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:29,119
Wu, let two law firms celebrate together

280
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,802
at the Sichuan restaurant downstairs.

281
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,600
No. Why did the spending standard suddenly decrease?

282
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,040
Boss, I thought you didn't like Jincheng & Co.

283
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,722
The main issue is that no one can handle spicy food, right?

284
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:46,162
Yu Fei, can you handle spicy food?

285
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,720
We, Guangdong people, eat everything,

286
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,080
except for spicy food.

287
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,921
You're from Guangdong?

288
00:23:53,121 --> 00:23:55,240
Why? Don't I look like it? My mom is from Northeast China.

289
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,761
Is there a problem?

290
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:03,762
I can handle spicy food.

291
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,319
I can handle it very well.

292
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,722
From the time I met you in college until now,

293
00:24:10,818 --> 00:24:13,442
it's the first time I've heard the words "win-win" from your mouth.

294
00:24:14,441 --> 00:24:15,962
I thought you didn't like spicy food.

295
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:17,717
It's settled then.

296
00:24:19,985 --> 00:24:21,802
It's okay. Don't be disappointed.

297
00:24:22,207 --> 00:24:23,440
We'll have a seafood feast next time.

298
00:24:23,606 --> 00:24:24,826
Next time, okay?

299
00:24:26,941 --> 00:24:28,121
I thought you didn't like spicy food.

300
00:24:28,201 --> 00:24:30,680
- They said the environment around here is really nice.   - Really.

301
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,601
We have some people at the other tables outside.

302
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,980
So, Lawyer Wu...

303
00:24:35,145 --> 00:24:37,745
- Can we sit at the table outside?   - Take care of the outside tables.

304
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:39,162
I also want to go.

305
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,602
Hello, may I ask who will be ordering?

306
00:24:42,738 --> 00:24:44,337
Bei Qing, you're familiar with this restaurant.

307
00:24:44,418 --> 00:24:45,521
Go ahead and place the order.

308
00:24:45,648 --> 00:24:46,648
Okay.

309
00:24:46,744 --> 00:24:47,964
I also know Sichuan cuisine.

310
00:24:49,096 --> 00:24:50,152
It's the same.

311
00:24:50,324 --> 00:24:53,322
One order of spicy spare ribs, dry-fried beef noodles with green peppers,

312
00:24:53,403 --> 00:24:56,240
Kung Pao chicken, spicy diced chicken, and diving bullfrog.

313
00:24:56,347 --> 00:24:58,056
The Sichuan dishes here are quite spicy.

314
00:24:58,137 --> 00:24:59,962
If anyone can't handle the spice,

315
00:25:00,135 --> 00:25:01,882
can you make it mild for us?

316
00:25:04,222 --> 00:25:06,018
Gu Bei Qing, can you handle spicy food?

317
00:25:06,143 --> 00:25:07,762
- Do you want me to make it less spicy for you?   - No need.

318
00:25:07,952 --> 00:25:09,482
I'm from Sichuan. I love spicy food.

319
00:25:09,932 --> 00:25:11,133
I'm mainly worried about Lawyer Qian.

320
00:25:11,214 --> 00:25:12,281
Then, make it extra spicy.

321
00:25:12,413 --> 00:25:14,754
- One order for all your signature dishes.   - Okay.

322
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,901
- Extra spicy, please.   - Okay, got it.

323
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:25,042
Sorry, my stomach hasn't been feeling well lately.

324
00:25:26,053 --> 00:25:27,475
Oh yeah, the main purpose of today

325
00:25:27,556 --> 00:25:29,160
is also to discuss cooperation with Lawyer Li.

326
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,761
How about you guys dine in here first?

327
00:25:30,841 --> 00:25:32,205
I'll come and pay for the bill later.

328
00:25:32,537 --> 00:25:33,577
Okay.

329
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,202
Let everyone dine here. We can go upstairs to talk.

330
00:25:36,297 --> 00:25:37,517
Good idea.

331
00:25:41,361 --> 00:25:44,482
I just remembered we booked a movie ticket. It's about to start.

332
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,400
Unfortunately, I won't be able to join everyone.

333
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,660
- Let's go.   - When did you book it?

334
00:25:48,741 --> 00:25:49,793
Just now.

335
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,220
- Are there any new movies recently?   - Yes.

336
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,590
- My stomach can't handle spicy food.   - Ignorant.

337
00:25:55,671 --> 00:25:57,602
- I can't handle spicy.   - You guys enjoy your meal.

338
00:26:08,881 --> 00:26:10,642
- Please enjoy.   - Thank you.

339
00:26:13,441 --> 00:26:16,601
I used to see Lawyer Gu eating Sichuan food with Cheng Yao.

340
00:26:16,681 --> 00:26:17,901
Is this place very spicy?

341
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,762
- It's okay.   - Is it delicious?

342
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:20,971
Not bad.

343
00:26:21,681 --> 00:26:23,880
- Actually, I can eat very spicy food.   - Try it.

344
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,539
I come from a place that enjoys eating spicy food.

345
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,840
It makes me crave it.

346
00:26:30,953 --> 00:26:32,173
How is it?

347
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:34,722
- I'm done eating.   - You guys eat.

348
00:26:35,931 --> 00:26:37,151
Isn't it too spicy?

349
00:26:38,881 --> 00:26:40,361
- Let's eat.   - Come on.

350
00:26:40,476 --> 00:26:41,661
Yao Yao.

351
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,401
Do you always eat together?

352
00:26:44,121 --> 00:26:46,562
- Not really, not very often.   - Occasionally.

353
00:26:46,742 --> 00:26:48,600
We have two upcoming cases to work on together.

354
00:26:48,684 --> 00:26:50,602
So our frequency of eating together will be a bit higher.

355
00:26:52,641 --> 00:26:54,082
- Come on, let's eat.   - Let's eat.

356
00:27:04,385 --> 00:27:06,384
Lawyer Qian, this is no ordinary noodles.

357
00:27:06,471 --> 00:27:08,040
It's dry beef noodles with chopped spicy peppers.

358
00:27:08,142 --> 00:27:09,546
It uses finely chopped bird's eye chili,

359
00:27:09,649 --> 00:27:11,842
mixed with minced beef, and eaten together with noodles.

360
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:13,919
Do you think I can't read?

361
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,119
I didn't mean that.

362
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,441
This dish is really spicy.

363
00:27:16,641 --> 00:27:18,739
Before, Cheng Yao and I ate it together.

364
00:27:18,842 --> 00:27:20,040
We could only eat half.

365
00:27:20,193 --> 00:27:22,455
Just one bowl of noodles, and you both had to eat it together?

366
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:23,904
Can't one person finish it?

367
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,940
No...

368
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,300
Lawyer Qian.

369
00:28:08,121 --> 00:28:09,601
Wei Zhen Tian, come here.

370
00:28:15,881 --> 00:28:17,101
Wei Zhen Tian.

371
00:28:19,681 --> 00:28:20,901
Wei Zhen Tian?

372
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,260
Wei Zhen Tian?

373
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,020
Wei Zhen Tian.

374
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:30,461
Wei Zhen Tian.

375
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,841
Kid, why are you digging through the trash?

376
00:28:35,223 --> 00:28:36,722
Come here.

377
00:28:41,937 --> 00:28:44,936
Are you stupid? Don't you know you can't eat chocolate? You'll die.

378
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,260
This kid...

379
00:28:57,503 --> 00:28:59,344
Doctor, I...

380
00:28:59,841 --> 00:29:01,761
- Never mind.   - Mom, why are you here?

381
00:29:01,875 --> 00:29:04,061
Qian Heng, I got a call from your butler

382
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:05,663
saying something happened to you and the dog.

383
00:29:05,872 --> 00:29:08,051
Did you get bitten by a stray dog? Did it bite your head?

384
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,959
Then, you should go to a human hospital.

385
00:29:11,161 --> 00:29:12,601
Why did you go to a pet hospital?

386
00:29:12,681 --> 00:29:14,281
Mom, it wasn't me.

387
00:29:14,429 --> 00:29:15,731
- If not you, then who?   - Doctor.

388
00:29:15,812 --> 00:29:18,240
- Doctor, how is it?   - It's fine. Don't worry.

389
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,117
Your dog has already had its stomach washed in time.

390
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,682
There is no danger to its life now.

391
00:29:21,944 --> 00:29:23,104
But just to be safe,

392
00:29:23,206 --> 00:29:25,242
you should observe it closely for the next few days.

393
00:29:25,976 --> 00:29:28,663
Can you tell me what else I need to pay attention to?

394
00:29:29,437 --> 00:29:31,262
After the dog's stomach is washed, it might feel scared.

395
00:29:31,343 --> 00:29:33,440
So, you should spend more time with it for the next few days.

396
00:29:33,528 --> 00:29:35,569
Give it easily digestible food.

397
00:29:35,663 --> 00:29:37,462
Also, make sure to keep it warm.

398
00:29:38,232 --> 00:29:39,452
Got it.

399
00:29:39,632 --> 00:29:42,121
Okay. You can rest here for a bit and observe it.

400
00:29:42,201 --> 00:29:43,881
If everything is all right, you can leave.

401
00:29:43,961 --> 00:29:45,280
Thank you.

402
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,660
You're welcome.

403
00:29:47,055 --> 00:29:49,017
- I'll go buy a blanket.   - Mom, it's okay.

404
00:29:49,161 --> 00:29:50,381
Come on.

405
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,559
Come hug it.

406
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,020
Slow down.

407
00:30:01,436 --> 00:30:02,656
Come on.

408
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,260
Come on. Be careful.

409
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,202
Mom,

410
00:30:15,511 --> 00:30:18,350
what is easy to digest for dogs?

411
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,241
I have some foie gras at home.

412
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,121
Can dogs eat foie gras?

413
00:30:25,201 --> 00:30:26,920
Of course not.

414
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,084
Right.

415
00:30:29,165 --> 00:30:30,562
Then, what can it eat?

416
00:30:31,881 --> 00:30:33,101
Qian Heng,

417
00:30:33,495 --> 00:30:36,983
I can't believe how caring you are toward a dog.

418
00:30:37,078 --> 00:30:40,319
You have changed so much since you've been with Cheng Yao.

419
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,880
You don't even realize it.

420
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,402
The way you looked at the dog just now

421
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,070
was exactly how your dad

422
00:30:46,327 --> 00:30:49,752
looked at you back then.

423
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,962
Mom, I have to go now.

424
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,300
You go back quickly.

425
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,880
Did I say something wrong again?

426
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,032
Why did you come?

427
00:31:23,247 --> 00:31:24,486
Even Wei Zhen Tian is here.

428
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,640
It accidentally ate chocolate and just had its stomach washed.

429
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,680
I'm afraid I can't care for it properly, so I came to you.

430
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,002
What did the doctor say?

431
00:31:32,237 --> 00:31:33,758
The doctor said to observe it for a few days.

432
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,260
So I brought it here.

433
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,162
- Come in first.   - Okay.

434
00:31:39,681 --> 00:31:40,901
Come on.

435
00:31:45,165 --> 00:31:46,565
Wei Zhen Tian.

436
00:31:46,841 --> 00:31:48,520
You can't eat chocolate, okay?

437
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,761
You're even lying in someone else's suit.

438
00:31:53,841 --> 00:31:55,061
Hurry up and come out.

439
00:31:56,441 --> 00:32:00,520
If you'll dirty the suit, you'll become hot pot meat.

440
00:32:01,555 --> 00:32:02,775
I'm afraid it will get cold.

441
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:05,518
And the doctor said that if there's a familiar smell,

442
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:06,819
it will feel more at ease.

443
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,181
Did it scratch your hand?

444
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:12,962
I'm fine. It just scratched me a little.

445
00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:14,886
How is that okay?

446
00:32:15,848 --> 00:32:17,585
But it has been vaccinated for rabies.

447
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:19,227
Otherwise, you would have to get a shot.

448
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,740
Let me disinfect it for you.

449
00:33:14,088 --> 00:33:18,002
Can I stay at your place tonight?

450
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:19,122
No.

451
00:33:19,203 --> 00:33:20,599
I don't know how to take care of a dog.

452
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,981
Just leave it here, and I'll take care of it.

453
00:33:23,423 --> 00:33:24,944
Can you let me rest for a while before I leave?

454
00:33:25,071 --> 00:33:26,311
I'm not feeling well.

455
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,120
Enough, stop acting.

456
00:33:49,257 --> 00:33:51,042
Fine, go rest then.

457
00:33:51,144 --> 00:33:52,364
I'll go work overtime.

458
00:33:53,841 --> 00:33:55,061
I...

459
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,881
Your hands are so hot.

460
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,540
Are you running a fever?

461
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,536
I don't know.

462
00:34:03,617 --> 00:34:06,237
Maybe my stomach is upset and the air conditioning is too strong.

463
00:34:06,614 --> 00:34:09,216
Why can Wei Zhen Tian stay when it is sick?

464
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,656
Why can't I stay when I'm sick?

465
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,380
(It's freshly washed.)

466
00:34:55,451 --> 00:34:57,671
Come on. Let's sleep.

467
00:35:28,881 --> 00:35:30,280
How are you feeling now?

468
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,682
Drink this.

469
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,020
I added some vitamin C.

470
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,882
Still feeling uncomfortable?

471
00:35:43,361 --> 00:35:44,581
A little.

472
00:35:45,952 --> 00:35:47,111
It's so hot.

473
00:35:47,192 --> 00:35:48,574
Get up and go to the hospital with me.

474
00:35:48,655 --> 00:35:50,282
- I don't want to.   - Stop messing around.

475
00:35:50,426 --> 00:35:52,067
Your head will be damaged if your fever continues to rise.

476
00:35:52,378 --> 00:35:53,642
I don't want to take the trouble.

477
00:35:59,401 --> 00:36:01,282
It's been a long time since we've done this.

478
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,041
Peacefully.

479
00:36:03,281 --> 00:36:06,441
You, me, and Wei Zhen Tian.

480
00:36:08,149 --> 00:36:10,909
If I go to the hospital and my fever goes down,

481
00:36:11,944 --> 00:36:13,823
you won't make me come again.

482
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:25,562
Considering that I saved Wei Zhen Tian's life,

483
00:36:25,887 --> 00:36:27,536
could you help me cook a bowl of porridge?

484
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,220
Wait for me.

485
00:36:30,582 --> 00:36:31,802
Go back to sleep for a while.

486
00:36:32,296 --> 00:36:33,976
Let's get out.

487
00:36:53,327 --> 00:36:54,682
Why did you come out?

488
00:36:55,287 --> 00:36:56,507
I'm feeling better.

489
00:36:58,877 --> 00:37:01,057
Wait for a while. The porridge is almost ready.

490
00:38:05,281 --> 00:38:06,501
Fell asleep?

491
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,820
Almost.

492
00:38:08,281 --> 00:38:09,361
Eat it.

493
00:38:09,441 --> 00:38:10,661
Be careful, it's hot.

494
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,321
The taste is strange.

495
00:38:19,401 --> 00:38:21,600
I added ginger. Sweating helps with a fever.

496
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,002
I don't eat ginger.

497
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,760
I made it myself, won't you eat it?

498
00:38:29,448 --> 00:38:31,642
Okay. After eating, go to bed early.

499
00:38:32,761 --> 00:38:34,122
You'll feel better tomorrow.

500
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,420
Yao Yao.

501
00:38:38,841 --> 00:38:40,061
I want to get married.

502
00:38:40,961 --> 00:38:42,840
I want to be able to see you every day in the future.

503
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,599
Before, I never realized

504
00:38:52,727 --> 00:38:55,522
what a promise means in a relationship.

505
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,520
Until you said you didn't want to get married,

506
00:38:58,701 --> 00:39:00,102
I suddenly panicked.

507
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,240
I felt like you didn't need me anymore

508
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,220
and I was really scared.

509
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,900
So now,

510
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:12,520
I want a promise from you.

511
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,820
Can you give me that?

512
00:39:14,961 --> 00:39:16,181
Oh yeah,

513
00:39:16,801 --> 00:39:20,120
raising Wei Zhen Tian also makes me feel like I'm raising a child.

514
00:39:20,215 --> 00:39:21,435
It's actually quite nice.

515
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,962
What if I don't want to?

516
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,460
Why not?

517
00:39:26,717 --> 00:39:27,881
We've already done everything.

518
00:39:27,972 --> 00:39:29,882
Isn't it time to move on to the next stage?

519
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,122
In legal terms, this is called social consensus.

520
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:37,270
So, you want me to take on the responsibility?

521
00:39:37,816 --> 00:39:39,882
The opposing party acts as both the litigant and the lawyer.

522
00:39:42,389 --> 00:39:45,000
But my party believes this is a voluntary matter for both parties.

523
00:39:45,143 --> 00:39:47,823
In modern society, we should not be bound by traditional views.

524
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,320
Cheng Yao, how could you do this?

525
00:39:50,881 --> 00:39:52,422
Okay, hurry up and eat.

526
00:39:52,503 --> 00:39:54,042
I'll let you move back in

527
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,962
since you're sick.

528
00:40:21,841 --> 00:40:24,121
What? Taking a day off?

529
00:40:26,235 --> 00:40:27,912
I remember when you had appendicitis surgery,

530
00:40:27,993 --> 00:40:29,360
you were still researching in your hospital bed.

531
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,541
You didn't even take a day off then. Is something important happening?

532
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,300
(Something very important.)

533
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,700
Something very important?

534
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,743
(Since that's the case,)

535
00:40:41,824 --> 00:40:46,642
(can you explain why you were in line to buy milk tea?)

536
00:40:53,841 --> 00:40:56,241
I heard they have a milk tea that's limited to 100 cups per day.

537
00:40:56,345 --> 00:40:57,941
If you don't finish drinking within two hours,

538
00:40:58,022 --> 00:40:59,522
the taste will change.

539
00:41:02,733 --> 00:41:05,293
Qian, have you lost your focus due to pride?

540
00:41:05,853 --> 00:41:07,188
You haven't even received the Golden Scale Award yet.

541
00:41:07,276 --> 00:41:08,556
And you're already slacking off.

542
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,540
Here...

543
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,940
You're wasting your time and life here.

544
00:41:16,399 --> 00:41:18,639
Have you ever thought about Junheng's key performance indicators?

545
00:41:19,241 --> 00:41:21,641
Don't you want your year-end bonus this year?

546
00:41:21,963 --> 00:41:23,183
Oh, fine.

547
00:41:23,368 --> 00:41:25,666
Then, all the unused vacation days will be paid at triple salary.

548
00:41:25,778 --> 00:41:27,160
And those days you used before...

549
00:41:27,241 --> 00:41:29,290
Fine, take the leave now. Use it immediately, right here.

550
00:41:29,371 --> 00:41:30,762
Take as much time off as you want.

551
00:41:33,969 --> 00:41:35,522
What kind of milk tea is this?

552
00:41:35,976 --> 00:41:37,322
Is it really that delicious?

553
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,681
Everyone, pay attention.

554
00:41:45,776 --> 00:41:46,842
Cheng Yao.

555
00:41:47,392 --> 00:41:49,673
With everyone's combined efforts,

556
00:41:49,754 --> 00:41:53,442
our law firm has earned 15 pennants this month.

557
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:56,071
Lawyer Cheng alone has contributed seven of them.

558
00:41:56,383 --> 00:41:57,603
Let's give her a round of applause.

559
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,162
Lawyer Li, there's a gentleman who insists on seeing Lawyer Cheng.

560
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,741
I couldn't stop him.

561
00:42:06,361 --> 00:42:07,581
Who is it?

562
00:42:12,721 --> 00:42:13,961
I'm really sorry.

563
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,820
Sorry.

564
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,681
This time, it's something important.

565
00:42:17,761 --> 00:42:19,080
So I didn't inform you beforehand.

566
00:42:19,198 --> 00:42:20,679
Lawyer Qian, come whenever you please.

567
00:42:20,791 --> 00:42:22,350
The new receptionist doesn't know.

568
00:42:23,321 --> 00:42:25,282
Are you today for a new case?

569
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,860
I'm here to deliver milk tea.

570
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:31,110
- Ming Lei. Distribute the milk tea, please.   - Okay, Lawyer Qian.

571
00:42:31,191 --> 00:42:33,160
Thanks for your hard work. Lawyer Qian brought milk tea for everyone.

572
00:42:33,241 --> 00:42:36,322
- Thank you, Lawyer Qian.   - Thank you, Lawyer Qian.

573
00:42:36,646 --> 00:42:38,406
Do you have to make such a big deal out of it?

574
00:42:39,841 --> 00:42:41,061
No, it's not that.

575
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,242
You reposted so many lucky draw posts online.

576
00:42:44,417 --> 00:42:46,602
I have to bring the prizes for you.

577
00:42:48,675 --> 00:42:50,820
Try it. I'll give you the straw.

578
00:42:54,936 --> 00:42:56,547
Since we have such a good relationship,

579
00:42:56,628 --> 00:42:57,842
how about we chat about work together?

580
00:42:57,941 --> 00:43:00,242
Sorry, Lawyer Li. I've been delaying work.

581
00:43:00,761 --> 00:43:01,981
Is it causing delays?

582
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,820
No, it's not.

583
00:43:05,999 --> 00:43:08,240
Lawyer Cheng has worked really hard these past few days.

584
00:43:08,321 --> 00:43:09,841
I was just about to give her a break.

585
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:11,922
Thank you. Where is your workstation?

586
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,620
Break?

587
00:43:14,928 --> 00:43:16,148
Yes, taking a break.

588
00:43:16,481 --> 00:43:18,882
If you have any problems, let's discuss them after your break.

589
00:43:19,361 --> 00:43:21,501
Thanks again. Let's go.

590
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,380
Have a happy vacation!
