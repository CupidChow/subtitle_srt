1
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,882
(My Boss)

2
00:01:41,695 --> 00:01:44,122
(Episode 6: Cheng Yao, don't harbor unrealistic hopes.)

3
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:04,242
Nowadays, even cucumber salad requires plating.

4
00:02:05,002 --> 00:02:06,803
Plating can be quite exquisite.

5
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,725
This dish only costs a few yuan.

6
00:02:08,806 --> 00:02:11,202
If served in a restaurant, it would cost tens of yuan.

7
00:02:12,431 --> 00:02:14,482
You're not running a restaurant, so why waste time?

8
00:02:14,643 --> 00:02:18,522
We should learn to appreciate the little joys of life.

9
00:02:20,548 --> 00:02:24,202
Boss, do you mind if we talk about Bai Xing Meng's case while we eat?

10
00:02:24,362 --> 00:02:26,082
Why are you so interested in this case?

11
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:29,214
This is the first case I took on when I joined Junheng & Co.

12
00:02:29,295 --> 00:02:31,125
I hope to have a good start.

13
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,842
Besides, Bai Xing Meng is so nice.

14
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,042
I want to do my best to help her get the rights she deserves.

15
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:37,673
We can't let that bad guy get away with it.

16
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,149
Bai Xin Meng is so nice?

17
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,349
Cheng Yao, keep your distance from your client.

18
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,789
What do you mean?

19
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:50,083
If you want to be a good lawyer,

20
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,990
you have to remember that when you're working,

21
00:02:53,322 --> 00:02:54,845
you have no emotions, only a stance.

22
00:02:55,194 --> 00:02:57,042
You stand on your client's side, considering for her

23
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,520
and advocating for her best interests within the bounds of the law.

24
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,740
That's no problem.

25
00:03:01,082 --> 00:03:03,320
But, this is solely grounded in your professional ethics as her agent,

26
00:03:03,407 --> 00:03:04,762
not driven by personal sentiments.

27
00:03:05,026 --> 00:03:06,359
You think too unprofessionally.

28
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,562
But shouldn't the bad guy be punished?

29
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,520
Who told you Xu Jun must be a bad guy

30
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,922
and Bai Xing Meng must be the victim?

31
00:03:12,017 --> 00:03:14,367
Are you the party involved, or did you witness something?

32
00:03:15,138 --> 00:03:17,642
In this relationship, Bai Xing Meng put in true feelings,

33
00:03:17,773 --> 00:03:19,602
while Xu Jun took advantage of her.

34
00:03:20,322 --> 00:03:22,782
Marriage is a stable relationship between two adults.

35
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,960
It's not a fairy tale of "I love you, you love me".

36
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,353
And, which law states that if one puts in true feelings,

37
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,300
the other must return equal feelings?

38
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:33,416
Boss, you eat by yourself.

39
00:03:33,497 --> 00:03:34,927
I'm going back to the room to look at the case files.

40
00:03:59,671 --> 00:04:01,042
(Do you have time tomorrow?)

41
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,989
(Do you want to come out for a meal?)

42
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,994
(I've already made plans with Yao Yao to go to the amusement park.)

43
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,960
You deserve to be my Qian.

44
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,602
10 rings, so impressive!

45
00:04:46,355 --> 00:04:47,395
Qian.

46
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,402
Didn't you sleep well last night? Look at those dark circles.

47
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,580
Shut up.

48
00:04:52,515 --> 00:04:53,576
What do you want from me?

49
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,652
So, the Law Association has an event tomorrow.

50
00:04:56,733 --> 00:04:57,733
I'm not going.

51
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,040
I know you're not interested

52
00:05:01,127 --> 00:05:02,770
in these non-profitable activities.

53
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,802
But, the president of the Law Association has called you out by name.

54
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,920
And, this event tomorrow will be especially helpful

55
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,981
for the Golden Scale Award.

56
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,751
Don't you want the Golden Scale Award?

57
00:05:12,641 --> 00:05:15,235
No need to take shortcuts.

58
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,828
Don't worry. It's absolutely reasonable and legal.

59
00:05:17,989 --> 00:05:19,682
It's just an event about

60
00:05:19,776 --> 00:05:21,598
the spiritual civilization of contemporary young lawyers.

61
00:05:21,705 --> 00:05:24,574
Everyone will gather and communicate with each other.

62
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,550
Just take it easy.

63
00:05:30,883 --> 00:05:34,359
Why did President Zhang call me out to join this kind of activity?

64
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,921
It must be because President Zhang thinks you have a lot of influence

65
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:38,393
and you are qualified enough.

66
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,890
You didn't know that Deng Ming also wanted to go,

67
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,601
but President Zhang directly refused.

68
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,648
What do you think? Are you proud?

69
00:05:45,581 --> 00:05:47,766
- No exceptions.   - Okay, definitely.

70
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,054
Oh, one more thing.

71
00:05:50,135 --> 00:05:52,562
Every law firm has to send one male and one female lawyer.

72
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,682
I'm going to let Cheng Yao go.

73
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,306
Why her?

74
00:05:56,387 --> 00:05:57,627
Everyone in my team is busy.

75
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,202
I had to look for someone from your team.

76
00:05:59,362 --> 00:06:01,682
If you don't have any objections, I'll inform Cheng Yao right away.

77
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,391
No need. I'll tell her.

78
00:06:05,051 --> 00:06:06,653
Usually you just tell others to do these things.

79
00:06:06,768 --> 00:06:08,056
Why are you so eager to do it today?

80
00:06:08,137 --> 00:06:10,058
To prevent you from influencing the newcomer negatively.

81
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,800
You want Cheng Yao to go,

82
00:06:12,893 --> 00:06:14,544
but still worry about my influence on her.

83
00:06:14,643 --> 00:06:16,722
If she gets influenced, even if she gets fired,

84
00:06:16,803 --> 00:06:18,864
it will still affect our firm's image.

85
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,440
All right.

86
00:06:40,521 --> 00:06:42,162
Considering the flower you bought,

87
00:06:42,283 --> 00:06:43,682
I forgive you for what happened last night.

88
00:06:43,788 --> 00:06:45,348
Make some dinner. I'm hungry.

89
00:06:45,682 --> 00:06:47,642
This flower is for decorating the house,

90
00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:48,962
not for you.

91
00:06:55,511 --> 00:06:58,547
Oh, right. At 9 am tomorrow, you and I, on behalf of our law firm,

92
00:06:58,628 --> 00:07:00,788
will attend a panel discussion hosted by the Law Association.

93
00:07:02,226 --> 00:07:03,777
Why do you want me to go?

94
00:07:05,283 --> 00:07:08,272
Because everyone else has to work overtime this Sunday, except for you.

95
00:07:10,552 --> 00:07:11,730
By taking you to the event,

96
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,839
it's like announcing that you're a lawyer in our team.

97
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,282
This is an endorsement for your future job hopping.

98
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,156
People who leave my team tend to be highly competitive elsewhere.

99
00:07:20,468 --> 00:07:21,642
Aren't you afraid that

100
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,442
someone as outstanding as me will be undercut tomorrow?

101
00:07:24,718 --> 00:07:27,503
Be more rigorous. This isn't undercutting. This is a takeover.

102
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,629
But, I made plans with my sister tomorrow.

103
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,703
How much do you owe me in debt?

104
00:07:37,935 --> 00:07:40,842
Sure. Of course I'm going. The boss's word is the law.

105
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:45,300
Can I skip the supper tonight?

106
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:46,959
Are you bargaining with me?

107
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,589
That's obviously not possible.

108
00:07:49,494 --> 00:07:52,279
Take note. Don't sing when you make dinner.

109
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,709
Sing when you make supper.

110
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,402
(Happy Valley)

111
00:08:14,604 --> 00:08:17,599
(Cheng Xi, I was temporarily conscripted by the boss today.)

112
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,245
(I'm afraid you won't go if you're alone.)

113
00:08:19,385 --> 00:08:21,282
(So, I am only telling you now.)

114
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,323
(The tickets for the amusement park were purchased as a group,)

115
00:08:23,404 --> 00:08:24,602
(and they are non-refundable.)

116
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,840
(You go in and have fun first.)

117
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,322
(Cheer up a bit.)

118
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,950
(I'll come meet you when I'm done.)

119
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,259
I got it.

120
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:35,039
Don't worry. I'm already here.

121
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,341
You can work in peace.

122
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,701
Wu Jun.

123
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,242
What are you doing here?

124
00:08:54,859 --> 00:08:55,998
I'm here to play.

125
00:08:56,264 --> 00:08:57,677
Cheng Yao suddenly had to work overtime.

126
00:08:57,758 --> 00:08:58,898
Is that your doing?

127
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,116
No, it's not.

128
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,693
I heard it from Qian Heng. Cheng Yao has to work overtime today.

129
00:09:03,774 --> 00:09:05,923
I rushed over to keep you company in case you get bored.

130
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,160
I'll tag along with you.

131
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,787
Right? Look at this blue sky and white clouds.

132
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,402
And, the old friends are meeting.

133
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,720
How nice.

134
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,399
Okay, I got it.

135
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:16,760
So, let's agree.

136
00:09:16,841 --> 00:09:19,151
Let's relax today.

137
00:09:19,534 --> 00:09:21,391
- No talking about work.   - No talking about work.

138
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,420
It's cloudy today.

139
00:09:28,366 --> 00:09:29,766
But, it's sunny in my heart.

140
00:09:29,922 --> 00:09:30,923
Wait a minute.

141
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,003
Yes.

142
00:09:48,976 --> 00:09:49,976
Wu Jun.

143
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:51,456
I'd like to ask you something.

144
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:53,442
How did the discussion on the construction of spiritual civilization

145
00:09:53,523 --> 00:09:55,442
turn into a singles' party?

146
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,280
Qian.

147
00:09:58,483 --> 00:10:00,362
Solving singlehood is one of the most important topics

148
00:10:00,443 --> 00:10:02,953
of spiritual civilization for contemporary young lawyers.

149
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,602
Okay. You won't get your bonus this year.

150
00:10:09,395 --> 00:10:11,522
What did you say? I can't hear you.

151
00:10:12,922 --> 00:10:14,402
The signal is too bad.

152
00:10:20,638 --> 00:10:22,435
Boss, we're here already.

153
00:10:22,516 --> 00:10:24,547
Why don't we just go through the standard procedure?

154
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,511
You seem to really want to join, right?

155
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:31,922
Come on, everyone.

156
00:10:32,074 --> 00:10:33,271
Dear lawyer friends.

157
00:10:33,393 --> 00:10:35,851
First of all, thank you all for taking the time out of your busy schedule

158
00:10:35,932 --> 00:10:39,243
to come to the Law Association singles' party.

159
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,082
Today's activity is divided into two parts.

160
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:44,722
The first part is getting to know each other.

161
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,680
The second part is a rowing activity.

162
00:10:46,842 --> 00:10:48,859
Let me explain the content of getting to know each other.

163
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,639
It's for each male lawyer

164
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,402
and each female lawyer

165
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,442
to have a face-to-face conversation for three minutes.

166
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:59,149
- Three minutes.   - I hope everyone maximizes these three minutes

167
00:10:59,247 --> 00:11:01,910
to accelerate each other's understanding.

168
00:11:02,003 --> 00:11:05,882
Okay. If there's no problem, let's start our first part.

169
00:11:06,055 --> 00:11:09,181
Next, everyone will sit facing each other.

170
00:11:09,534 --> 00:11:11,442
Let's begin the activity.

171
00:11:15,946 --> 00:11:16,946
Hello.

172
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:18,042
Hello.

173
00:11:18,651 --> 00:11:19,671
Hello.

174
00:11:26,872 --> 00:11:29,682
Lawyer Qian, what type of girl do you like?

175
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,282
90, 50, 90.

176
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,661
- What does that mean?   - Body measurements.

177
00:11:36,344 --> 00:11:39,220
And, I only like a 34 proportion to a 21 egg-shaped face.

178
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,757
And, the area is strictly controlled

179
00:11:40,838 --> 00:11:42,362
within 16 cm by 10 cm.

180
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,560
Besides the figure and the face,

181
00:11:45,711 --> 00:11:47,351
what other requirements do you have for girls?

182
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:49,773
Keeping long, flowing hair for me forever.

183
00:11:54,497 --> 00:11:57,200
If you start dating, where would you go on dates with your girlfriend?

184
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,300
The office.

185
00:11:58,778 --> 00:12:00,440
What would you do in the office?

186
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,860
Work overtime together.

187
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:04,682
What if it's a normal date?

188
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,082
Given the busy schedules of lawyers,

189
00:12:06,163 --> 00:12:08,602
what do you think is the optimal meeting frequency?

190
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,922
That kind of date you said doesn't even exist.

191
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,751
I refuse to do anything unrelated to work.

192
00:12:56,296 --> 00:12:57,806
Qian, what's wrong with you?

193
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,920
It's just a singles' party, yet you still receive complaints.

194
00:13:01,001 --> 00:13:02,322
What's a 50 cm waist measurement?

195
00:13:02,403 --> 00:13:04,109
And hair that won't be cut for life?

196
00:13:04,322 --> 00:13:07,388
Are you even establishing a size standard for people's faces?

197
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,068
Why not suggest they avoid sleeping for life and just live in the office?

198
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,520
I'm telling you.

199
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,121
Can you provide a valid reason to reject others?

200
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,088
(Junheng & Co needs to maintain its corporate image.)

201
00:13:17,169 --> 00:13:19,002
Hello?

202
00:13:19,576 --> 00:13:20,636
What did you say?

203
00:13:21,227 --> 00:13:23,287
I can't hear you. The signal is too bad.

204
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,762
Okay. Fine.

205
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,722
Everyone.

206
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,882
Our next activity is boat rowing.

207
00:13:40,088 --> 00:13:41,248
Two persons per group.

208
00:13:41,361 --> 00:13:43,837
Let's determine victory by seeing which group

209
00:13:43,936 --> 00:13:46,166
can row to the other side of our meeting point.

210
00:13:46,745 --> 00:13:49,272
Everyone already has a preliminary understanding of each other

211
00:13:49,353 --> 00:13:50,358
in the morning.

212
00:13:50,439 --> 00:13:54,119
So, we will form teams freely, okay?

213
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,122
- Let's start.   - Good.

214
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:57,760
- Can I invite you?   - Sure.

215
00:13:57,841 --> 00:13:58,877
Let's go.

216
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,158
- Can I invite you to join my team?   - Sure.

217
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,119
Hello, can I team up with you?

218
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,477
- Hello, miss.   - Can I invite you to form a team?

219
00:14:08,036 --> 00:14:09,525
Sure. Then I'll...

220
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:10,629
Cheng Yao.

221
00:14:11,442 --> 00:14:12,442
Come over.

222
00:14:15,068 --> 00:14:16,498
What's up, boss?

223
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,700
Team up with me.

224
00:14:20,763 --> 00:14:23,488
It's rare to have such an opportunity for different law firms to interact.

225
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,176
Shouldn't we mix up the teams

226
00:14:25,286 --> 00:14:27,202
and interact with our peers?

227
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,082
I'm ordering you with your year-end bonus to team up with me.

228
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,720
Boss.

229
00:14:54,254 --> 00:14:56,242
It's rare to go out for outdoor activities.

230
00:14:56,345 --> 00:14:58,082
Do you want to move your muscles a bit?

231
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,602
Boat rowing can actually enhance both the body and the mind.

232
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:07,362
Don't you hate losing the most?

233
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,882
If we keep going like this,

234
00:15:09,004 --> 00:15:10,244
we won't just lose.

235
00:15:10,352 --> 00:15:11,922
We'll end up last.

236
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:14,562
I've always wanted to experience what it feels like to lose a lawsuit.

237
00:15:15,776 --> 00:15:16,976
But, I can't lose.

238
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,583
If I can experience it this time, I think it's not bad.

239
00:15:39,283 --> 00:15:41,312
Seems like there's hope.

240
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:47,094
As long as we can get into the top three, we can get a bonus.

241
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,460
It's 200 yuan.

242
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,842
My paddle.

243
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,459
What to do?

244
00:16:19,296 --> 00:16:20,436
Boss.

245
00:16:22,697 --> 00:16:24,643
- Someone fell into the water.   - Help! Come!

246
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,270
Come, save him!

247
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,400
Cheng Yao!

248
00:16:27,481 --> 00:16:29,151
Boss, are you okay?

249
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,642
Cheng Yao, did you lose your mind?

250
00:16:31,735 --> 00:16:33,798
I have a life jacket. Why did you jump in?

251
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,260
I was afraid you couldn't swim.

252
00:16:35,341 --> 00:16:37,262
I can't swim. You swim up quickly.

253
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,871
You pulled tight.

254
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:50,282
Boss.

255
00:16:50,394 --> 00:16:52,202
I know you fell because

256
00:16:52,307 --> 00:16:53,637
you were trying to help me retrieve the paddle.

257
00:16:53,718 --> 00:16:56,110
Thank you. But, are you cold?

258
00:16:57,042 --> 00:16:58,063
Cheng Yao.

259
00:16:58,202 --> 00:16:59,762
Don't harbor unrealistic hopes.

260
00:17:00,946 --> 00:17:02,002
First, you pushed me into the water.

261
00:17:02,128 --> 00:17:03,967
Then, you risked your life to save me.

262
00:17:04,282 --> 00:17:06,274
Thinking that would make me relent and absolve you of your debt.

263
00:17:06,385 --> 00:17:07,798
You can forget about that.

264
00:17:11,045 --> 00:17:12,045
Boss.

265
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,759
Actually, the lines you just said are already outdated.

266
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,199
Those lines belong to a decade ago.

267
00:17:16,295 --> 00:17:18,602
Idol dramas have evolved significantly since then.

268
00:17:21,682 --> 00:17:23,242
Let's go. Find a hotel.

269
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,522
What are we going to do at the hotel?

270
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:28,198
Of course, change clothes.

271
00:17:28,442 --> 00:17:30,073
What do you think I want to do to you?

272
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,162
Hard to say.

273
00:17:55,557 --> 00:17:56,906
What's wrong? Let's go.

274
00:17:59,472 --> 00:18:01,408
Cheng Xi. There's a lake over there.

275
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,562
Why don't we go row the lake on the boat first?

276
00:18:05,101 --> 00:18:07,882
No. Let's go row a boat on the lake.

277
00:18:08,163 --> 00:18:09,472
You're scared.

278
00:18:11,705 --> 00:18:14,002
Don't be scared. This haunted house is so much fun.

279
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,240
Let's go.

280
00:18:43,764 --> 00:18:45,402
Cheng Xi, are you not scared?

281
00:18:49,282 --> 00:18:51,482
It's okay. I'll protect you.

282
00:18:58,985 --> 00:19:00,416
Cheng Xi.

283
00:19:00,643 --> 00:19:02,433
Run.

284
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,030
Oh my gosh.

285
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,340
I'm so scared, Cheng Xi.

286
00:19:09,642 --> 00:19:10,882
I'm so scared.

287
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,960
It's okay.

288
00:19:21,736 --> 00:19:23,202
Run.

289
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:35,167
What's wrong?

290
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,300
What happened?

291
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,910
There's a ghost.

292
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,231
Where's the person?

293
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,991
Okay, it looks like it's gone.

294
00:19:54,899 --> 00:19:56,602
How was it? Was it fun?

295
00:19:56,688 --> 00:19:58,082
- Was it exciting?   - It was too exciting.

296
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:00,882
This isn't fun. This is self-torture.

297
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:02,521
Are you scared?

298
00:20:04,124 --> 00:20:05,562
Why are your lips so pale?

299
00:20:05,697 --> 00:20:07,407
I'm sure I'm a bit anemic now.

300
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:09,763
Then, close your eyes.

301
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,117
- I'll take you out.   - No way.

302
00:20:11,198 --> 00:20:12,698
I'm even more panicked if I can't see you.

303
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:16,402
- Then, hold on.   - Okay, hold on.

304
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:18,752
- Let's go.   - Let's go.

305
00:20:22,282 --> 00:20:24,301
Hurry up.

306
00:20:37,207 --> 00:20:38,482
Are you okay?

307
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,580
Are you okay?

308
00:20:45,513 --> 00:20:47,362
I'm sorry.

309
00:20:47,498 --> 00:20:49,002
I'm taking you out.

310
00:20:59,316 --> 00:21:00,495
Oh my.

311
00:21:03,675 --> 00:21:05,026
We're at the exit.

312
00:21:05,424 --> 00:21:06,724
It's okay now.

313
00:21:19,831 --> 00:21:21,152
After all these years,

314
00:21:21,248 --> 00:21:23,677
I've heard a lot of gossip about you.

315
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,710
They say you like to turn female clients into girlfriends.

316
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,884
Is this your technique?

317
00:21:35,621 --> 00:21:37,103
No, Cheng Xi.

318
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:38,482
There must be some misunderstanding here.

319
00:21:38,587 --> 00:21:40,122
I must clarify this thing with you.

320
00:21:40,203 --> 00:21:41,883
I have a responsibility. I have this obligation.

321
00:21:41,992 --> 00:21:44,631
First of all, I have never developed

322
00:21:44,738 --> 00:21:47,442
any relationships outside of work with any female clients.

323
00:21:47,593 --> 00:21:49,762
Secondly, I have already gone ashore for you.

324
00:21:49,899 --> 00:21:52,457
I am now a good young man.

325
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,402
For me?

326
00:21:55,962 --> 00:21:57,319
We are all adults.

327
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,602
- I understand.   - It's great if you understand.

328
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,160
No, that's not right. You don't understand.

329
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:05,722
Cheng Xi, I'm not what you think.

330
00:22:05,835 --> 00:22:09,642
I'll take responsibility for what happened that night.

331
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,880
Which night?

332
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,099
That is...

333
00:22:19,268 --> 00:22:21,650
Hello, Miss Wang.

334
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,442
Miss Wang, I'm a bit inconvenient now.

335
00:22:30,241 --> 00:22:31,464
Okay, let's talk about it later.

336
00:22:31,545 --> 00:22:32,545
Right.

337
00:22:32,981 --> 00:22:34,575
Okay, it's settled then.

338
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,780
Okay, bye.

339
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,482
- Client.   - Female client?

340
00:22:40,115 --> 00:22:43,082
Yeah. What a coincidence. I just talked about this.

341
00:22:43,594 --> 00:22:45,642
(Qian Heng.)

342
00:22:55,647 --> 00:22:58,321
Are you done? I just told you it's the weekend today.

343
00:22:58,415 --> 00:22:59,557
I have something important to do now.

344
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,920
If you don't have a good reason to call me, we might have a problem.

345
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,258
All right. Go to my villa first and bring me a full set of clothes.

346
00:23:05,562 --> 00:23:07,682
- I'll send you the address.   - All the clothes,

347
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,482
including underwear.

348
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:13,076
Oh yeah. Then go to the women's clothing store

349
00:23:13,157 --> 00:23:14,200
and buy a set of women's clothing.

350
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,673
- (A full set too.)   - What kind of women's clothing?

351
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:21,736
What did you do? You need women's clothing?

352
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,568
(Don't talk so much. Hurry up.)

353
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,957
Cheng Xi, I guess I have to go first.

354
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,322
I understand.

355
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,722
You go. Work is more important.

356
00:23:38,147 --> 00:23:39,328
Miss Wang, right?

357
00:23:39,924 --> 00:23:41,515
No, it's Qian Heng.

358
00:23:42,035 --> 00:23:43,821
Isn't she want to buy women's clothing?

359
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:45,956
I heard it all. Hurry up.

360
00:23:46,065 --> 00:23:47,625
Don't make her wait.

361
00:23:47,728 --> 00:23:49,798
Qian Heng is buying women's clothing.

362
00:23:52,371 --> 00:23:54,160
It seems like you don't believe it.

363
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,595
He's done me wrong. Oh my.

364
00:23:57,703 --> 00:23:58,882
I...

365
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:01,191
I'll explain to you later. Cheng Xi, sorry.

366
00:24:25,321 --> 00:24:26,986
I'm done, boss. Your turn now.

367
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,239
- Boss, your clothes...   - Don't touch me.

368
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:32,002
- I'll do it myself.   - Boss.

369
00:24:32,141 --> 00:24:33,322
Why the big reaction?

370
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,720
I didn't do anything.

371
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,562
I used to mistakenly think you were experienced in relationships.

372
00:24:38,648 --> 00:24:39,998
I didn't expect you to be so shy.

373
00:24:44,196 --> 00:24:45,922
You made me look like a pervert.

374
00:25:04,643 --> 00:25:06,883
Qian, open the door. I'm here.

375
00:25:11,481 --> 00:25:12,700
Why?

376
00:25:12,867 --> 00:25:14,331
Hurry up and go in.

377
00:25:19,002 --> 00:25:20,393
Give it to me. Go back.

378
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,270
Qian, why are you dressed like this?

379
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,122
What about Cheng Yao? What did you do to Cheng Yao?

380
00:25:26,968 --> 00:25:27,982
Cheng Yao? Where is Cheng Yao?

381
00:25:28,063 --> 00:25:29,311
Did you bully her? What did you do?

382
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,569
- How did you treat her? How do I...   - My taste isn't that bad.

383
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:33,929
What do you mean by your taste isn't that bad?

384
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,375
Yeah, it's literal meaning.

385
00:25:37,468 --> 00:25:38,962
You can't even reach my aesthetic standards.

386
00:25:40,214 --> 00:25:42,882
You're talking like you can reach my aesthetic standards.

387
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,882
Wait. Both of you, stop arguing.

388
00:25:44,962 --> 00:25:48,921
Can someone tell me why the two of you are dressed like this?

389
00:25:49,513 --> 00:25:51,267
There's a fool who dragged me into the water.

390
00:25:51,722 --> 00:25:53,402
That fool even saved you.

391
00:25:53,482 --> 00:25:54,578
So, do you admit that you're the fool?

392
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:55,953
All right, you two idiots. Stop arguing.

393
00:25:56,034 --> 00:25:57,474
Come on, change your clothes.

394
00:26:00,772 --> 00:26:02,082
I'm leaving.

395
00:26:03,513 --> 00:26:06,202
Don't tell anyone about this today.

396
00:26:06,322 --> 00:26:08,082
- Otherwise, you...   - I got it, idiot.

397
00:26:10,338 --> 00:26:11,729
Take care of yourself.

398
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,070
Don't worry, boss. I don't want anyone else to know either.

399
00:26:18,459 --> 00:26:19,762
You better don't.

400
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,630
Don't spread it to me.

401
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,160
Yu Fei.

402
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:42,402
Scan and save the settlement report and the verdict.

403
00:26:42,682 --> 00:26:43,722
Cheng Yao,

404
00:26:44,698 --> 00:26:45,738
help me make an appointment with the client tomorrow.

405
00:26:45,849 --> 00:26:47,811
Boss, are you all right?

406
00:26:47,962 --> 00:26:49,552
Do you want me to buy you some medicine?

407
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,350
If you could go, you would have gone already.

408
00:26:51,563 --> 00:26:53,701
I want to go, but my leg...

409
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,840
You go.

410
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,830
I won't refuse.

411
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:08,359
Do you notice your boss

412
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,042
suddenly become a bit fragile and lovable after being sick?

413
00:27:11,252 --> 00:27:12,759
He is like those sickly beauties.

414
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,000
Despite his unwell condition, he still puts on a facade of strength.

415
00:27:15,081 --> 00:27:17,081
Such a cute character.

416
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,744
So, you like this kind of weak-bodied guys?

417
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,549
Go get treated if you're sick.

418
00:27:27,043 --> 00:27:28,512
Cheng Yao, you're also catching a cold.

419
00:27:30,442 --> 00:27:32,183
Stay away from me. Don't infect me.

420
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,110
Didn't you just say you like this kind of character?

421
00:27:35,636 --> 00:27:36,656
Is that so?

422
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:51,039
You're back, boss.

423
00:27:52,186 --> 00:27:54,305
Do you want to drink ginger tea? I keep a cup for you.

424
00:27:54,386 --> 00:27:55,696
It's good for a cold.

425
00:27:55,898 --> 00:27:56,998
No.

426
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,802
Is this useful?

427
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,620
Yes, it is.

428
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,870
Ginger tea has many uses.

429
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,842
You never drank ginger tea?

430
00:28:18,379 --> 00:28:19,728
Give me a cup then.

431
00:28:23,004 --> 00:28:24,834
Didn't you just say you don't want to drink it?

432
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:26,882
I've finished it.

433
00:28:32,084 --> 00:28:33,104
Boss,

434
00:28:33,792 --> 00:28:35,782
can I discuss something with you?

435
00:28:36,242 --> 00:28:37,442
I have a cold today.

436
00:28:37,522 --> 00:28:38,882
I don't have any energy.

437
00:28:39,043 --> 00:28:41,522
For dinner tonight, we're having instant noodles.

438
00:28:41,648 --> 00:28:42,922
For supper, we'll have stir-fried instant noodles.

439
00:28:43,073 --> 00:28:45,202
- How about that?   - Don't push it.

440
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,567
Making instant noodles also requires effort.

441
00:28:52,024 --> 00:28:53,842
And, I really don't understand

442
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,682
why did you want to share a place with me?

443
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:57,830
And, you even insisted that I make supper for you.

444
00:28:57,911 --> 00:28:58,997
Making the supper is one thing,

445
00:28:59,078 --> 00:29:00,562
but you also wanted me to sing while I'm making it.

446
00:29:00,722 --> 00:29:03,642
I made it but you didn't even eat it.

447
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,820
Could it be because you think

448
00:29:09,928 --> 00:29:13,722
my righteous demeanor can hold the fort?

449
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,082
Actually, it's mainly because of...

450
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,460
Qian Heng.

451
00:29:18,922 --> 00:29:20,833
Qian Heng, I know you're home.

452
00:29:22,163 --> 00:29:23,402
Qian Heng.

453
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:25,747
Don't move. Whatever you do, don't open the door.

454
00:29:25,828 --> 00:29:27,602
Qian Heng, I'm warning you. If you don't open the door...

455
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:29,843
Who is it? Your ex-girlfriend?

456
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,220
No, don't pay attention to her. Don't open the door.

457
00:29:32,331 --> 00:29:34,122
- Don't open the door.   - Qian Heng.

458
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,122
I'm really getting angry.

459
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,242
(This is the girl that Qian Heng is hiding from.)

460
00:29:49,407 --> 00:29:52,150
Qian Heng, if you don't open the door, I'm really going to make a scene.

461
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,960
Hello.

462
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,320
(I'm not home.)

463
00:30:02,416 --> 00:30:04,726
(Please don't disturb my girlfriend, Cheng Yao.)

464
00:30:09,184 --> 00:30:10,722
I'm not good.

465
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:13,882
You're looking for Qian Heng, right?

466
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,215
- I'm his...   - Enough.

467
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,122
You don't need to show off here.

468
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:18,762
I know.

469
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,191
You're Qian Heng's girlfriend.

470
00:30:23,163 --> 00:30:24,343
Cheng Yao.

471
00:30:26,876 --> 00:30:28,682
Although I don't want to admit it,

472
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:30,886
Qian Heng's taste is pretty good.

473
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,562
But, he and I are really not in a relationship.

474
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:40,467
I know.

475
00:30:40,563 --> 00:30:42,762
You two have strong bonds now.

476
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,821
Can I come in?

477
00:30:45,242 --> 00:30:46,383
Please come in.

478
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,682
Qian Heng doesn't even live in his villa, all for you.

479
00:30:51,722 --> 00:30:53,322
He's living in this kind of apartment.

480
00:30:54,442 --> 00:30:55,873
But, let me tell you.

481
00:30:56,168 --> 00:30:59,022
Some feelings can only be temporary.

482
00:31:01,179 --> 00:31:02,492
Qian Heng and I are not as what you think.

483
00:31:02,573 --> 00:31:03,802
Don't be so confident.

484
00:31:04,282 --> 00:31:05,842
The future is long. Listen!

485
00:31:05,923 --> 00:31:07,562
Qian Heng will always be mine.

486
00:31:10,412 --> 00:31:12,842
As long as he remains unmarried,

487
00:31:13,323 --> 00:31:18,992
I, Dong Min, will compete with you, Cheng Yao till the end.

488
00:31:21,874 --> 00:31:23,644
But, the two of us really aren't in that kind of relationship.

489
00:31:23,858 --> 00:31:25,193
How do I express it so that you believe me?

490
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,441
Why don't you admit it?

491
00:31:26,522 --> 00:31:27,882
He's already sent me messages.

492
00:31:29,883 --> 00:31:30,943
Look.

493
00:31:35,324 --> 00:31:36,562
Don't be so happy.

494
00:31:36,743 --> 00:31:37,762
You're so happy.

495
00:31:39,543 --> 00:31:42,322
In short, I'm here to declare war today.

496
00:31:45,442 --> 00:31:46,663
Let me tell you.

497
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,701
Qian Heng

498
00:32:02,813 --> 00:32:03,832
will always

499
00:32:08,043 --> 00:32:09,183
be mine.

500
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,741
That's about it.

501
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,403
- Let me send you off.   - Thank you.

502
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Thank you.

503
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,701
She left.

504
00:32:44,803 --> 00:32:45,863
Boss.

505
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,219
Why did you send that kind of message?

506
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,682
Because I've figured out that you will definitely open the door.

507
00:32:54,768 --> 00:32:56,482
You noticed that.

508
00:32:58,681 --> 00:33:00,116
But, I was also

509
00:33:00,205 --> 00:33:02,841
afraid your ambiguous partner would get jealous and misunderstand,

510
00:33:02,961 --> 00:33:04,361
so I opened the door.

511
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:07,322
Let me correct you. I'm only ambiguous with money.

512
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,842
Who is she?

513
00:33:12,602 --> 00:33:13,842
The daughter of a big client.

514
00:33:13,943 --> 00:33:15,042
I refused her.

515
00:33:15,136 --> 00:33:16,317
But, she wouldn't listen.

516
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,910
Is that client important?

517
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,482
He was my first client at the beginning of my career.

518
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,922
So, it's really special to you.

519
00:33:28,315 --> 00:33:32,842
So, you were avoiding the crazy pursuit of the client's daughter

520
00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:35,042
when you decided to humbly rent with me.

521
00:33:35,952 --> 00:33:37,640
I am representing a family case for this client

522
00:33:37,729 --> 00:33:39,642
with a targeted amount of 700 million.

523
00:33:43,601 --> 00:33:44,603
But, boss,

524
00:33:44,684 --> 00:33:46,844
Dong Min already knows your address.

525
00:33:46,972 --> 00:33:48,962
Living here doesn't make sense anymore.

526
00:33:50,518 --> 00:33:51,837
And, I think

527
00:33:51,984 --> 00:33:54,375
you living with a small employee like me

528
00:33:54,471 --> 00:33:55,820
is an insult to yourself.

529
00:33:57,481 --> 00:33:59,162
Do you consider moving out?

530
00:34:01,092 --> 00:34:04,112
Besides this apartment, is there really no other place to live?

531
00:34:04,364 --> 00:34:05,364
Nope.

532
00:34:06,643 --> 00:34:09,162
And, you just heard that I have a villa,

533
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,540
but it's too far from the firm to be convenient.

534
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,310
The rich are whimsical.

535
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,391
(Ting Ting, I believe Qian Heng must have a secret.)

536
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,882
(A lawyer with a net worth of over a hundred million)

537
00:34:28,036 --> 00:34:31,202
(leaving his big villa and living here with me in this small place.)

538
00:34:37,502 --> 00:34:39,622
(He also has a hardworking maidservant.)

539
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,176
(Don't interrupt. I have to figure it out.)

540
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,429
(Otherwise, I really can't turn things around.)

541
00:34:52,265 --> 00:34:54,466
Fei, have a drink.

542
00:34:54,563 --> 00:34:55,783
Thank you.

543
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,119
- Bao.   - You are being so nice.

544
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,640
I'm embarrassed.

545
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,901
What should I do?

546
00:35:03,292 --> 00:35:05,263
- Half sugar next time.   - Okay.

547
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,815
What's up?

548
00:35:08,171 --> 00:35:12,086
Do you have the case files for the boss's work in the last three months?

549
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,562
I want to learn from them.

550
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,519
Yes. I also have meeting notes.

551
00:35:15,607 --> 00:35:18,122
- I'll highlight the important points for you.   - Great.

552
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,271
Fei, you're so serious.

553
00:35:21,817 --> 00:35:23,487
Cheng Yao is so sensible.

554
00:35:23,727 --> 00:35:26,601
You are truly a rare talent that Junheng & Co. needs.

555
00:35:27,499 --> 00:35:29,249
Life forces us to be better.

556
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,082
(Let me take a look.)

557
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,220
(Can I find any flaws in these recent files?)

558
00:35:49,746 --> 00:35:52,482
The others are all over 10 million.

559
00:35:53,311 --> 00:35:55,682
Why is there only this one worth 5 million?

560
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,559
And, it's just a regular divorce case.

561
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:08,842
(The amount is so small.)

562
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,431
(There must be something wrong.)

563
00:36:33,885 --> 00:36:34,922
(Hello.)

564
00:36:35,869 --> 00:36:38,810
Hello. I'm Lawyer Qian Heng's assistant.

565
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,399
- I want to help him...   - (Why call me?)

566
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,031
(Not cooperating with the treatment.)

567
00:36:42,161 --> 00:36:43,280
(Attacking me personally.)

568
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,700
(He deserves to have insomnia.)

569
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,469
(I can't do anything about his illness.)

570
00:36:46,629 --> 00:36:48,409
(Tell your boss he should rely on his luck.)

571
00:36:52,238 --> 00:36:53,399
Insomnia.

572
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,400
Take note. Don't sing when you make dinner.

573
00:36:56,489 --> 00:36:57,842
Sing when you make supper.

574
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:00,562
You don't eat supper. Why do I have to make them?

575
00:37:00,865 --> 00:37:02,536
Eating supper is not good for my health.

576
00:37:11,006 --> 00:37:12,522
Boss, supper is ready.

577
00:37:12,791 --> 00:37:14,282
What's going on?

578
00:37:14,512 --> 00:37:15,733
Falling asleep?

579
00:37:18,588 --> 00:37:21,122
After all that fuss, he is treating me like a sleeping pill.

580
00:37:22,902 --> 00:37:23,942
Cheng Yao.

581
00:37:24,122 --> 00:37:25,442
I need to look at the materials later.

582
00:37:25,561 --> 00:37:27,081
No need to make supper tonight.

583
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,082
(Can't sleep, huh?)

584
00:38:27,813 --> 00:38:28,922
Boss.

585
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,672
I made porridge. Do you want some?

586
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,870
I'll come in and get it for you.

587
00:38:45,498 --> 00:38:47,150
(He actually fell asleep.)

588
00:38:47,553 --> 00:38:49,264
He's now under my control.

589
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,790
I knew things weren't so simple.

590
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,830
Cheng Yao.

591
00:39:36,309 --> 00:39:38,876
Cheng Yao. Did you make supper yesterday?

592
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,962
But, didn't you say not to?

593
00:39:42,043 --> 00:39:43,682
I only made my own.

594
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,602
Next time, when I say no supper,

595
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:47,303
I mean not even for yourself.

596
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,082
Boss, did you finish reading the materials yesterday?

597
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,739
Do you need my help?

598
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,960
It's just a bit of material.

599
00:39:55,123 --> 00:39:56,602
I can finish it without staying up late.

600
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,140
Good morning, Bao.

601
00:40:08,431 --> 00:40:09,431
Cheng Yao.

602
00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:13,722
Do you know that the boss had a meeting with me yesterday

603
00:40:13,956 --> 00:40:15,682
but he didn't show up at the appointed time?

604
00:40:16,738 --> 00:40:18,000
I know.

605
00:40:18,081 --> 00:40:19,182
No, you don't know.

606
00:40:22,502 --> 00:40:23,721
You don't know.

607
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,140
He said sorry to me.

608
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:27,628
He overslept yesterday.

609
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,521
"Sorry"?

610
00:40:29,602 --> 00:40:31,123
This is the first time in four years

611
00:40:31,204 --> 00:40:33,626
since I started working here that I heard him say "sorry" to someone.

612
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,359
Could you have heard wrong?

613
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,522
No way. I'm telling you,

614
00:40:37,625 --> 00:40:40,282
with sufficient effort, even an iron pestle can be ground into a needle.

615
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,200
That's how persevering I am.

616
00:40:42,281 --> 00:40:43,320
I worked with injury.

617
00:40:43,416 --> 00:40:45,650
This apology is the greatest recognition from the boss to me.

618
00:40:45,892 --> 00:40:47,401
Congratulations, Bao.

619
00:40:49,226 --> 00:40:51,407
Do you feel that the boss has changed recently?

620
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,402
He seems to have a kind of fatherly aura.

621
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,429
His temper has also improved.

622
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,631
He's so cool!

623
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,912
Maybe this is the joy after tormenting someone.

624
00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:05,719
What's wrong with you?

625
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,962
- You look dissatisfied with the boss.   - How dare I?

626
00:41:08,063 --> 00:41:10,063
- You are dissatisfied.   - Who are you not satisfied with?

627
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,280
No one.

628
00:41:12,932 --> 00:41:15,002
I'm not very satisfied with my attending doctor.

629
00:41:15,151 --> 00:41:17,057
My leg has been like this for so long without getting better.

630
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:18,670
It's like it's broken or something.

631
00:41:19,627 --> 00:41:21,067
It just hasn't been getting better.

632
00:41:21,176 --> 00:41:23,556
The bones were connected, but were they connected wrongly or something?

633
00:41:29,978 --> 00:41:31,618
Cheng Yao, go prepare.

634
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,375
Xu Jun and his lawyer will be here soon to do a pre-trial communication.

635
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,922
Should we notify Bai Xing Meng?

636
00:41:36,043 --> 00:41:38,270
She won't come. We'll communicate with her afterward.

637
00:41:38,351 --> 00:41:39,351
Okay.

638
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,139
Lawyer Qian, Mr. Xu has arrived.

639
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,221
Okay.

640
00:41:57,302 --> 00:41:58,363
Please come in.

641
00:42:03,283 --> 00:42:04,384
Mr. Xu.

642
00:42:04,505 --> 00:42:06,014
Hello, Lawyer Qian.

643
00:42:08,305 --> 00:42:09,305
Lawyer Qian.

644
00:42:09,425 --> 00:42:12,425
Hello, I am the representative lawyer for Mr. Xu Jun, Gu Bei Qing.

645
00:42:12,565 --> 00:42:13,565
Qian Heng.

646
00:42:16,637 --> 00:42:18,342
- Please have a seat.   - Please.

647
00:42:29,163 --> 00:42:31,042
Lawyer Qian. Actually,

648
00:42:31,664 --> 00:42:34,842
we came here today mainly to talk about an out-of-court settlement.

649
00:42:35,438 --> 00:42:37,829
I'm willing to compensate the assets that should be given to her.

650
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:39,242
I won't be stingy with a single penny.

651
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,241
But, Xing Meng has been refusing to communicate with me.

652
00:42:42,322 --> 00:42:43,992
I really have no other choice.

653
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,319
Mr. Xu, you can provide me with your settlement plan.

654
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,802
I will convey it to my client.

655
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,299
- Here.   - Thank you.

656
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,282
This is our proposed settlement plan.

657
00:43:09,571 --> 00:43:12,091
Mr. Xu hopes to reach a settlement out of court.

658
00:43:12,322 --> 00:43:14,202
This agreement is enough to prove our sincerity.

659
00:43:14,384 --> 00:43:17,294
Furthermore, Miss Bai is a celebrity in the entertainment industry.

660
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,882
Once the litigation process starts, she will be exposed to gossip.

661
00:43:19,976 --> 00:43:22,882
This is probably not a good thing for her image.

662
00:43:25,104 --> 00:43:26,120
Perfect.

663
00:43:26,435 --> 00:43:27,745
Really perfect.

664
00:43:28,762 --> 00:43:30,402
Unfortunately, I don't accept it.
