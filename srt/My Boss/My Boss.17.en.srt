1
00:01:35,642 --> 00:01:38,762
(My Boss)

2
00:01:39,671 --> 00:01:41,429
(Episode 17)

3
00:01:41,513 --> 00:01:43,922
(Madam Qian, it's not what you think.)

4
00:01:44,042 --> 00:01:45,401
(Listen to my explanation.)

5
00:01:51,701 --> 00:01:52,722
Cheng Yao.

6
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:57,068
- Boss. - I've had enough!

7
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:58,179
Let me wipe it for you.

8
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,260
Boss, I'm sorry.

9
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,920
It's not coming off.

10
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:02,750
Then, take it off. I'll wash it for you.

11
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,802
I'm sorry, I had headphones on and didn't notice you behind me.

12
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,211
I caught you.

13
00:02:13,172 --> 00:02:15,082
Luckily, the door wasn't closed.

14
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:17,440
Mom, why are you here?

15
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,298
Madam, I can explain.

16
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:21,839
No need to explain. Explanation is just a cover-up.

17
00:02:21,943 --> 00:02:23,843
No, Mom. It's really not what you think.

18
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,899
I saw her taking off your clothes.

19
00:02:29,352 --> 00:02:31,252
I didn't do anything.

20
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,520
I was young once, too.

21
00:02:33,635 --> 00:02:34,842
I understand.

22
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:41,198
It's okay. I understand.

23
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:44,019
My son is typically aloof,

24
00:02:44,253 --> 00:02:46,193
but his judgment is spot on.

25
00:02:46,364 --> 00:02:47,802
Come on, let me guess.

26
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:49,482
Let me guess.

27
00:02:49,978 --> 00:02:53,875
Are you a wealthy young lady who fell in love with him at first sight?

28
00:02:54,109 --> 00:02:58,174
Are you the CEO of a rival company that he both loves and competes with?

29
00:02:58,684 --> 00:03:01,645
Or are you his ex-girlfriend

30
00:03:01,831 --> 00:03:04,242
who came back to reconcile with him?

31
00:03:04,538 --> 00:03:07,882
I am mentally prepared, no matter which one of the above you are.

32
00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:10,739
Hello, Madam.

33
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:12,069
My name is Cheng Yao.

34
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,557
I am Lawyer Qian's assistant.

35
00:03:14,638 --> 00:03:15,962
I work at Junheng & Co.

36
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,789
You're the female supporting character who advanced

37
00:03:20,813 --> 00:03:22,426
by aligning herself with someone influential.

38
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,602
That's fine.

39
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:25,402
I am also prepared.

40
00:03:26,136 --> 00:03:27,386
No problem.

41
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,300
Tomorrow at noon.

42
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,710
At this restaurant.

43
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,780
Remember to come alone.

44
00:03:44,428 --> 00:03:45,522
This...

45
00:04:03,016 --> 00:04:06,676
I invited you here today.

46
00:04:07,018 --> 00:04:10,198
Do you know why?

47
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,442
No. This is too much.

48
00:04:12,621 --> 00:04:13,871
It's too much.

49
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:17,819
This side of my face looks better.

50
00:04:18,803 --> 00:04:23,384
Do you know why I invited you here today?

51
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,002
Yeah, my gaze.

52
00:04:30,266 --> 00:04:31,523
Just like that.

53
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,960
I feel so satisfied relieving my acting addiction.

54
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,790
Miss Cheng,

55
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,865
do you know

56
00:04:43,946 --> 00:04:47,482
why I invited you here today?

57
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,841
Is it because of what happened yesterday?

58
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:51,270
Madam, I can explain.

59
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,610
No need to explain.

60
00:04:53,238 --> 00:04:54,833
Let's get straight to the point.

61
00:04:54,914 --> 00:04:56,774
Don't waste each other's time.

62
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:00,682
How much money will it take for you to leave my son?

63
00:05:02,494 --> 00:05:03,499
5 million.

64
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,345
Madam, my boss and I are just housemates.

65
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,060
8 million.

66
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:11,559
If you don't believe me, you can ask my boss.

67
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:13,760
I'm just a little employee under him.

68
00:05:13,871 --> 00:05:15,682
How could he be with me?

69
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:19,002
10 million.

70
00:05:19,744 --> 00:05:21,363
You have to think carefully.

71
00:05:21,671 --> 00:05:23,711
10 million is not a small amount.

72
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:26,716
(Help me! Is she even listening to me?)

73
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,060
Madam, this is not about money.

74
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,037
Don't tell me that you and my son truly love each other.

75
00:05:35,464 --> 00:05:39,962
Even low-rated TV dramas don't use this kind of dialogue anymore.

76
00:05:40,352 --> 00:05:42,291
- Madam, I... - Do you think

77
00:05:42,552 --> 00:05:44,491
that after I give you the money,

78
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,701
I will turn around and accuse you of extortion?

79
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,120
I understand. That's normal.

80
00:05:52,312 --> 00:05:53,471
How about this?

81
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,399
I grant you permission to draft a gift contract on your own.

82
00:05:57,488 --> 00:05:59,029
We can go get it notarized

83
00:05:59,201 --> 00:06:03,449
to make sure I'm willing to give you the money as a gift

84
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:05,701
in a clear mind.

85
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,020
Why are you not speaking?

86
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,760
I hit the nail on the head, didn't I?

87
00:06:12,907 --> 00:06:14,807
It seems that your love for Qian Heng

88
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,941
is nothing special.

89
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,380
(Oh my, what is she saying?)

90
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:24,731
Madam, why don't you go talk to him? Okay?

91
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,280
Young lady, I won't allow someone like you

92
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,882
to enter our Qian family.

93
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:35,082
Why are you not speaking?

94
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,842
Madam, I don't have the chance to talk.

95
00:06:39,544 --> 00:06:40,794
Then you tell me,

96
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,661
what were you all doing yesterday?

97
00:06:43,192 --> 00:06:46,514
Yesterday, I accidentally spilled ketchup on him.

98
00:06:46,595 --> 00:06:49,540
And I was helping him wipe it off when you suddenly came in.

99
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:54,014
Why did you choose to wipe the ketchup for him instead of someone else?

100
00:06:54,116 --> 00:06:55,876
Because he was the only one there yesterday,

101
00:06:55,937 --> 00:06:57,482
and it was me who made the mess.

102
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,659
Then, why did you agree to live with him?

103
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:02,028
Because I don't have money.

104
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:14,231
Dad.

105
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,360
The butler told me that Mom fell down the stairs.

106
00:07:17,512 --> 00:07:18,762
Where is she?

107
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,320
Fine, I'll go back to the law firm.

108
00:07:26,344 --> 00:07:29,124
My life is so miserable.

109
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,467
(How could the boss, who grew up here, bear to stay in a rental house?)

110
00:08:16,084 --> 00:08:18,026
Miss Cheng, welcome.

111
00:08:18,135 --> 00:08:19,557
Please come this way.

112
00:08:19,638 --> 00:08:20,888
Okay.

113
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,190
This way, please.

114
00:08:28,513 --> 00:08:30,333
Mom, enough.

115
00:08:41,672 --> 00:08:42,922
Why are you here?

116
00:08:44,819 --> 00:08:46,087
Cheng Yao is here.

117
00:08:46,168 --> 00:08:48,588
Come in quickly.

118
00:08:50,099 --> 00:08:52,419
Madam said she's not feeling well and wants to see me.

119
00:08:52,534 --> 00:08:54,994
- Madam, are you okay? - Go back first.

120
00:08:55,748 --> 00:08:57,162
Don't leave. Come here.

121
00:08:57,301 --> 00:08:58,881
Let me take a good look at you.

122
00:09:04,841 --> 00:09:06,101
Are you okay, Madam?

123
00:09:07,859 --> 00:09:09,120
Cheng Yao.

124
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:11,199
You finally came.

125
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:24,077
You two must

126
00:09:24,443 --> 00:09:27,342
live a good life from now on.

127
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:29,309
Do you understand?

128
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:34,239
Okay? Promise me.

129
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,659
Madam.

130
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:50,430
Mom, stop acting.

131
00:09:51,901 --> 00:09:53,151
Madam.

132
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,357
I have explained this to you many times.

133
00:09:59,381 --> 00:10:00,899
There is nothing between me and Cheng Yao.

134
00:10:00,923 --> 00:10:02,682
Can you please stop watching idol drama?

135
00:10:03,699 --> 00:10:05,019
I didn't say anything.

136
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,402
Why are you in such a hurry?

137
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,627
- Cheng Yao has genuine feelings for you. - I...

138
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,842
She also came to see me with genuine intentions.

139
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,885
You should cherish her.

140
00:10:14,088 --> 00:10:17,212
Nowadays, there aren't many girls who don't care about money.

141
00:10:17,415 --> 00:10:20,565
Cheng Yao gave up 10 million for you.

142
00:10:20,815 --> 00:10:22,255
You should appreciate what you have.

143
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,560
What 10 million?

144
00:10:23,872 --> 00:10:25,922
Last time, Madam...

145
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,664
I gave her 10 million to make her leave you.

146
00:10:29,745 --> 00:10:31,109
But she firmly refused.

147
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,849
She declined. Where can we find a girl like her?

148
00:10:32,873 --> 00:10:34,220
Things are not like that, boss.

149
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,619
How are they not like that?

150
00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:37,811
Weren't you the one who turned down my offer of 10 million?

151
00:10:37,835 --> 00:10:40,014
- Yes. - Right. See.

152
00:10:40,095 --> 00:10:44,965
- But... - Besides love, I really can't find any other reason.

153
00:10:45,219 --> 00:10:47,919
Mom, Cheng Yao is willing to come and see you

154
00:10:48,057 --> 00:10:49,839
because you are her boss's mother.

155
00:10:49,927 --> 00:10:51,367
Can you please have some boundaries?

156
00:10:51,408 --> 00:10:52,934
Don't bully my subordinates.

157
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,842
Lawyer Qian,

158
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,134
please watch your words.

159
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,532
The word "bully" is not appropriate here.

160
00:11:00,941 --> 00:11:02,480
When did I bully her?

161
00:11:02,979 --> 00:11:05,522
I really, sincerely like Cheng Yao.

162
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,643
Her sincerity is akin to the proverb

163
00:11:08,776 --> 00:11:11,258
"with sincerity, even metal and stone can be opened."

164
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:12,859
It all moved me.

165
00:11:13,088 --> 00:11:15,779
So, I've decided to change my mind

166
00:11:15,874 --> 00:11:17,482
and let you two be together.

167
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,100
All right, come with me.

168
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,202
Okay.

169
00:11:21,394 --> 00:11:23,482
Why are you leaving?

170
00:11:23,987 --> 00:11:26,311
I still have to have a private conversation with Cheng Yao.

171
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,682
What private conversation do you two have?

172
00:11:30,002 --> 00:11:32,776
Why can't we have a private conversation?

173
00:11:32,846 --> 00:11:34,449
We share a strong friendship that transcends age.

174
00:11:34,473 --> 00:11:36,202
All right, pay your respects and leave.

175
00:11:36,721 --> 00:11:38,882
- Go. - Boss.

176
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,402
Madam.

177
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,850
Cheng Yao.

178
00:11:44,748 --> 00:11:45,828
Take a look.

179
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,922
Qian Heng is so supportive of you.

180
00:11:50,056 --> 00:11:52,957
But I haven't been in a relationship with him.

181
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,300
You're not lying to me, are you?

182
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,802
(No, your eyes are avoiding mine. You must be lying.)

183
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,482
Madam, please don't cry.

184
00:12:11,659 --> 00:12:13,599
Madam, crying too much can harm your health.

185
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,525
My health has never been good.

186
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,696
I've been probing, trying to matchmake you and Qian Heng.

187
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:22,679
It's because

188
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:24,860
I've always hoped

189
00:12:25,153 --> 00:12:28,374
that he could have someone by his side

190
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:31,520
so he wouldn't be so lonely.

191
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,059
But you two...

192
00:12:34,831 --> 00:12:36,151
Madam, don't worry.

193
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,880
My boss is so outstanding. He will definitely find someone soon.

194
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,059
Do you think he's outstanding?

195
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,480
Then, can you help me trick him into going on a blind date?

196
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,490
Okay.

197
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,447
Mr. Wang and Mr. Li. Help me catch this person taking photos.

198
00:13:23,578 --> 00:13:24,899
Don't move. What are you doing?

199
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,016
- What are you doing here? - I'm just taking photos.

200
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,760
- What photos? - Why are you catching me?

201
00:13:28,786 --> 00:13:31,722
- Tell me. - You took photos of me. Deng Ming hired you, right?

202
00:13:32,742 --> 00:13:35,382
- Where did he find you? - What did you say? I don't understand.

203
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,735
Little brat.

204
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,422
How dare you secretly photograph Lawyer Cheng?

205
00:13:38,446 --> 00:13:40,640
If you don't confess now, I'll send you to the police station.

206
00:13:40,664 --> 00:13:43,157
- Hurry up and speak. - If you don't confess, I'll beat you.

207
00:13:43,238 --> 00:13:44,482
I'll talk.

208
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,490
That person ordered online for me.

209
00:13:46,571 --> 00:13:48,100
I've never even met him.

210
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,082
Besides this camera, do you have any other secret recording tools?

211
00:13:51,284 --> 00:13:54,362
No. This camera is all I have.

212
00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:56,448
How to take the memory card out?

213
00:13:56,529 --> 00:13:57,779
Speak.

214
00:14:02,349 --> 00:14:03,802
Secret photography is illegal.

215
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,295
I'll take the memory card.

216
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:06,921
I'll let you off this time.

217
00:14:06,945 --> 00:14:09,345
But if I catch you again, I will definitely call the police.

218
00:14:10,036 --> 00:14:11,682
Thank you, ma'am. Thank you, sir.

219
00:14:11,778 --> 00:14:12,833
What sir?

220
00:14:12,938 --> 00:14:14,419
- Thank you, sir. - Go.

221
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,360
Thank you, Mr. Wang. Thank you, Mr. Li.

222
00:14:17,402 --> 00:14:18,521
No worries.

223
00:14:18,602 --> 00:14:20,362
Lawyer Cheng, you're really kind-hearted.

224
00:14:20,495 --> 00:14:22,115
You even let that scum leave like that.

225
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,320
- How is your son doing lately? - Do tell.

226
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,980
Thanks to you,

227
00:14:27,211 --> 00:14:29,075
the compensation for the work injury has been received.

228
00:14:29,099 --> 00:14:31,779
Now, my son has found a very virtuous girlfriend.

229
00:14:31,859 --> 00:14:32,980
He is doing well.

230
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,100
That's good.

231
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,700
Mr. Wang and Mr. Li, I'll leave first.

232
00:14:35,776 --> 00:14:36,979
Okay, you go ahead.

233
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,139
- Go ahead. - Thank you.

234
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,151
- It's nothing. - It's my duty.

235
00:14:41,164 --> 00:14:42,602
Lawyer Cheng is really nice.

236
00:14:43,044 --> 00:14:44,294
Come on.

237
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:46,068
- Let's go back. - Let's go.

238
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,242
Okay.

239
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,901
It's Deng Ming again.

240
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,122
Cheng Xi.

241
00:15:02,619 --> 00:15:04,160
Don't throw it.

242
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,962
Don't throw this away.

243
00:15:10,502 --> 00:15:12,463
I especially had someone deliver it.

244
00:15:12,575 --> 00:15:14,915
What's wrong? Is it not to your taste, or...

245
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,780
I don't eat food with unknown origins.

246
00:15:21,232 --> 00:15:24,261
Sorry. I didn't give you a heads-up in advance.

247
00:15:24,562 --> 00:15:26,325
This dessert is usually very difficult to order.

248
00:15:26,349 --> 00:15:27,739
I placed the order half an hour in advance today

249
00:15:27,763 --> 00:15:29,967
and thought it would take one or two hours for delivery.

250
00:15:29,991 --> 00:15:31,471
Then, I can give it to you in person.

251
00:15:31,546 --> 00:15:34,487
I don't know how it got delivered so quickly today.

252
00:15:37,485 --> 00:15:38,724
Wu Jun,

253
00:15:38,859 --> 00:15:40,640
I have told you many times

254
00:15:41,004 --> 00:15:42,764
that we should not have any contact anymore.

255
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,890
It's like this, Cheng Xi.

256
00:15:47,499 --> 00:15:48,860
If it's because of Deng Ming,

257
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,356
I don't think it's necessary at all.

258
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,899
I now have the strength and ability

259
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,516
to take care of you and also protect you.

260
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,079
I can also protect myself.

261
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:56,928
But then again,

262
00:15:57,276 --> 00:15:59,402
if you don't have any real feelings for me,

263
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,318
it's okay. You don't have to feel guilty.

264
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,562
I am your junior.

265
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,531
It's normal for a junior to take care of a senior.

266
00:16:12,724 --> 00:16:14,018
I don't need a junior.

267
00:16:14,169 --> 00:16:15,621
I don't need anyone to take care of me.

268
00:16:15,645 --> 00:16:16,962
I'll say it again.

269
00:16:17,093 --> 00:16:18,453
Don't come looking for me anymore.

270
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:20,739
(I'm doing this for your own good.)

271
00:17:21,337 --> 00:17:22,682
(You're in your thirties, )

272
00:17:22,994 --> 00:17:25,214
(divorced, and have nothing.)

273
00:17:34,473 --> 00:17:36,436
(Except for me, your ex-husband, who accepts you without any grudges, )

274
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,340
(who else can be as tolerant as me toward you?)

275
00:17:38,426 --> 00:17:41,219
(Divorce is the end of our previous relationship.)

276
00:17:41,372 --> 00:17:44,172
(Don't always belittle me and elevate yourself every time you see me.)

277
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:45,795
(What now? Will you be happy for a few days)

278
00:17:45,819 --> 00:17:47,282
(just by saying these few words?)

279
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:51,402
(A divorced woman is just someone who got dumped.)

280
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,762
(You got dumped. Why are you still here acting all high and mighty, )

281
00:17:54,856 --> 00:17:56,515
(feeling like you're different from others?)

282
00:17:56,539 --> 00:17:58,840
(Do you see yourself as a modern woman?)

283
00:18:17,776 --> 00:18:21,756
Honey, are you sure this is the correct way to match them up?

284
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:23,959
What if it backfires?

285
00:18:24,522 --> 00:18:26,340
If you're capable, then go ahead.

286
00:18:26,464 --> 00:18:28,179
If you were capable,

287
00:18:28,282 --> 00:18:33,329
your 30-year-old son wouldn't have remained single until now.

288
00:18:33,648 --> 00:18:35,307
Isn't it embarrassing?

289
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,922
Why are you both

290
00:18:40,167 --> 00:18:42,282
having no luck with relationships?

291
00:18:42,442 --> 00:18:43,692
It's driving me crazy.

292
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,350
Let me tell you.

293
00:18:46,443 --> 00:18:50,000
I've already listed a few children of my friends for you.

294
00:18:50,154 --> 00:18:51,762
Take a look and choose.

295
00:18:52,018 --> 00:18:55,457
Anyway, these families don't have a good relationship with us.

296
00:18:55,576 --> 00:18:56,897
If I offend them, then so be it.

297
00:18:57,031 --> 00:18:58,281
Is it okay?

298
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,530
You can take a look.

299
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,402
Okay, pay your respects and leave.

300
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,190
Okay.

301
00:19:12,979 --> 00:19:14,840
I can only reluctantly agree.

302
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:18,682
Let me see who can help them.

303
00:19:20,499 --> 00:19:24,362
(Can you help me trick him into going on a blind date?)

304
00:19:25,127 --> 00:19:28,461
(If he goes on a blind date, many girls will fall in love with him.)

305
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,381
Dad, Mom, why are you here?

306
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,854
What? Can't we come?

307
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,070
Have some water.

308
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,100
Is Qian not at home?

309
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,901
Didn't we talk about it before?

310
00:19:49,995 --> 00:19:52,473
Your father and I are planning to find a nice restaurant this weekend

311
00:19:52,497 --> 00:19:54,122
so we can have a meal together.

312
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:56,260
He's very busy.

313
00:19:56,347 --> 00:19:57,647
He doesn't have time to eat.

314
00:19:58,059 --> 00:19:59,619
What is he busy with?

315
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,992
Isn't his job usually busy at night?

316
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:05,893
He's on a business trip.

317
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,250
Business trip?

318
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:11,122
Do even masseurs have to go on business trips?

319
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,924
I forgot to mention that he took an urgent job in Guangzhou.

320
00:20:18,499 --> 00:20:21,340
It's urgent so the pay is higher.

321
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,919
He's doing one thing today and another tomorrow.

322
00:20:24,007 --> 00:20:25,367
It just doesn't sound reliable.

323
00:20:29,499 --> 00:20:31,042
Let me tell you, Yao Yao.

324
00:20:31,192 --> 00:20:34,332
None of those surnamed Qian can be relied upon.

325
00:20:34,739 --> 00:20:37,139
When I was in school, my deskmate had the surname Qian.

326
00:20:37,229 --> 00:20:38,282
I told you before.

327
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:43,146
He drew a table line with me and asked me to sign and stamp it.

328
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,810
If I crossed the line, he would fine me.

329
00:20:46,057 --> 00:20:47,678
Nonsense.

330
00:20:48,994 --> 00:20:50,962
His grades were not bad.

331
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,760
But his behavior wasn't good.

332
00:20:53,917 --> 00:20:55,516
One time, during our final exam,

333
00:20:55,702 --> 00:20:57,955
there was only one multiple-choice question that I couldn't answer.

334
00:20:57,979 --> 00:20:59,882
But he refused to let me see the answer.

335
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,530
In the end,

336
00:21:01,753 --> 00:21:03,292
I didn't pass.

337
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:08,765
But later, I heard he actually made a lot of money,

338
00:21:08,905 --> 00:21:10,139
living quite comfortably.

339
00:21:10,298 --> 00:21:11,682
I used to be superstitious.

340
00:21:11,935 --> 00:21:14,375
I thought he could become rich and successful

341
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,562
because of his surname, Qian.

342
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:19,015
But now it seems that's not the case.

343
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,902
My classmate can be so wealthy,

344
00:21:22,905 --> 00:21:25,346
but Qian Heng is so poor.

345
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,987
They both have the same surname.

346
00:21:27,011 --> 00:21:28,881
Why is there such a big difference?

347
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,040
Dad and Mom, we have been quite busy lately.

348
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,434
So, let's do this. I'll find a restaurant for the weekend.

349
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:44,958
You two can go and eat, okay?

350
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,146
I have to reply to a work email. It's urgent. I have to do it right away.

351
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,722
- You can sit for a while. - Okay.

352
00:21:50,259 --> 00:21:52,242
Look at her. She is so busy every day.

353
00:21:53,195 --> 00:21:54,445
Drink some water.

354
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,379
This girl wants to surprise us.

355
00:22:10,112 --> 00:22:11,852
The restaurant is already booked.

356
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,100
Although her boyfriend is not that great,

357
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,820
our daughter still cares about us.

358
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,621
Our daughter is truly filial.

359
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,080
Yao Yao is busy. Don't bother her. Let's go first.

360
00:22:31,167 --> 00:22:32,417
Okay.

361
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,850
Take this with you.

362
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,334
Yao Yao, you do your thing.

363
00:22:38,415 --> 00:22:40,415
Don't worry about us. We're leaving.

364
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,781
Be careful on the road.

365
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,170
I'm not going.

366
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,720
This viral restaurant has been really popular recently.

367
00:22:54,872 --> 00:22:57,139
And I heard there's also some kind of

368
00:22:57,243 --> 00:22:58,509
limited seafood set menu on weekends.

369
00:22:58,533 --> 00:22:59,682
It's a big portion.

370
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,460
They say the seafood is really fresh.

371
00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:04,149
And there's dessert after the meal.

372
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,680
The presentation is really beautiful.

373
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,940
Well. I'll reluctantly go and check it out then. But there's no next time.

374
00:23:15,984 --> 00:23:17,764
See you this weekend, boss.

375
00:23:25,464 --> 00:23:26,714
Where are my coupons?

376
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,601
Do you still need coupons when you go out to eat with me?

377
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,355
Saving a little bit is still saving.

378
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,787
No need.

379
00:23:48,122 --> 00:23:53,962
(The secret scandal between an arrogant CEO and his assistant.)

380
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,661
(She invited me out for a meal.)

381
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:57,282
(Her attitude was quite sincere.)

382
00:23:57,471 --> 00:23:59,511
(I reluctantly gave her some face by accepting it.)

383
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:09,443
(You are showing off online about her inviting you out.)

384
00:24:09,547 --> 00:24:12,328
(I really can't see how you're reluctant at all.)

385
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,719
(What's wrong?)

386
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,562
(Can't a tsundere be in a relationship?)

387
00:24:16,932 --> 00:24:19,510
(The clueless assistant and the arrogant CEO.)

388
00:24:19,633 --> 00:24:21,442
(This couple pairing has me hooked.)

389
00:24:31,896 --> 00:24:33,218
(For a restaurant date, )

390
00:24:33,345 --> 00:24:35,222
(what should guys wear?)

391
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,745
Sir. You've been sitting for a while now.

392
00:25:13,826 --> 00:25:15,706
Would you like me to bring out your food first?

393
00:25:16,156 --> 00:25:18,972
- No, it's okay. I'll wait a bit longer. Thank you. - Okay, sir.

394
00:25:25,667 --> 00:25:26,710
I'm sorry.

395
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:28,731
There was a lot of traffic on the road just now.

396
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,540
Excuse me. Did you mistake me for someone else?

397
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:34,764
- I already have plans with someone. - Yeah, with me.

398
00:25:35,939 --> 00:25:38,339
Qian Heng, one of the owners of a law firm.

399
00:25:38,551 --> 00:25:40,442
Your mother gave me your photos.

400
00:25:42,817 --> 00:25:44,562
- My mother invited you here? - Yes.

401
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:49,402
This restaurant is pretty good.

402
00:25:49,511 --> 00:25:51,771
I like it. You put effort into it.

403
00:25:54,081 --> 00:25:55,331
I'm treating you to this meal.

404
00:25:56,691 --> 00:25:57,950
Playing hard to get?

405
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,182
It's my first time seeing this new tactic.

406
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,850
It's quite interesting.

407
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,080
Have you always been this confident?

408
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,126
With what I have, shouldn't I be confident?

409
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,362
On the contrary, if I were humble, wouldn't that be hypocritical?

410
00:26:18,273 --> 00:26:20,633
I understand that you want to get to know me better

411
00:26:20,774 --> 00:26:22,418
but can we sit down and order first

412
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:23,749
and talk slowly?

413
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,930
Sit down.

414
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,970
Waiter, please bring the food.

415
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:33,442
- Okay, sir. Here are your seats. - Thank you.

416
00:26:38,385 --> 00:26:39,635
Qian Heng?

417
00:26:39,903 --> 00:26:41,522
Sir, Madam.

418
00:26:41,681 --> 00:26:44,620
Aren't you on a business trip? Aren't you working?

419
00:26:44,797 --> 00:26:47,396
How do you have the money to dress like this and come to this fancy place?

420
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,780
No, listen to me.

421
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,110
Wait a minute.

422
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,780
Who is she?

423
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,110
Who are you guys?

424
00:26:53,219 --> 00:26:54,515
You're interrupting my blind date.

425
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:55,860
- Wait... - Blind date?

426
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,356
- You heartless person. - Yao Yao works so hard to earn money

427
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:02,379
to support you and provide for you, yet you sneak off here with her.

428
00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:03,677
And you're so wasteful.

429
00:27:03,758 --> 00:27:05,901
- You look good outside but are rotten inside. - No.

430
00:27:05,925 --> 00:27:07,925
As expected, no one with the surname Qian is good!

431
00:27:07,986 --> 00:27:09,482
- Listen to me. - You!

432
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:12,341
Honey. I can't eat this meal anymore. Let's go.

433
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:13,804
Wait...

434
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,369
You wait for me. This isn't over.

435
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:19,469
Wait.

436
00:27:22,739 --> 00:27:23,989
Wait.

437
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,522
What does this mean?

438
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,719
You gave up your girlfriend for me?

439
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,080
Aren't you the owner of a law firm?

440
00:27:32,295 --> 00:27:33,935
Do you still need a woman to support you?

441
00:27:34,169 --> 00:27:36,709
Is the income in your industry really that low?

442
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,842
Is there even a need to continue this meal?

443
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,144
You're just a man who relies on women.

444
00:27:42,168 --> 00:27:44,348
Having dinner with you is a waste of my time.

445
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,310
Are you not trying to make me stay?

446
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,156
I can see that you just want a long-term meal ticket.

447
00:27:55,263 --> 00:27:57,273
You are not interested in women at all.

448
00:28:13,284 --> 00:28:14,319
Mom.

449
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,800
Yao Yao. Guess who we ran into just now?

450
00:28:16,976 --> 00:28:17,976
Who?

451
00:28:18,092 --> 00:28:21,021
It's your unreliable boyfriend.

452
00:28:21,845 --> 00:28:23,515
(Your dad and I were having dinner at the restaurant)

453
00:28:23,539 --> 00:28:25,860
(and we saw him with a girl on a blind date.)

454
00:28:25,994 --> 00:28:27,394
What is this? This is...

455
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:30,198
(Didn't you say he is working in another city, did you?)

456
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,060
(This is considered cheating, right?)

457
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,679
And then? Did you greet each other?

458
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,842
Greet? Your dad and I scolded him on the spot.

459
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,050
(I can see that girl won't end up with him either.)

460
00:28:41,818 --> 00:28:44,138
Yao Yao, listen to me.

461
00:28:44,376 --> 00:28:48,965
Break up with this person right now, immediately. You hear me?

462
00:28:51,048 --> 00:28:52,362
Yes. Break up!

463
00:29:00,865 --> 00:29:02,115
Boss.

464
00:29:04,731 --> 00:29:05,981
You're back.

465
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,880
I'm sorry, I didn't know my parents also went to that restaurant.

466
00:29:09,568 --> 00:29:11,548
Sorry for ruining your blind date.

467
00:29:12,467 --> 00:29:13,899
The Cheng family is quite interesting.

468
00:29:13,923 --> 00:29:15,948
One tricked me into a blind date, while the other ruined it for me.

469
00:29:15,972 --> 00:29:17,683
All-in-one service, huh?

470
00:29:17,764 --> 00:29:21,585
No. I just couldn't say no to your mom.

471
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,422
I'm warning you. Stay away from my mom.

472
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:29,122
But, she's your mother. I don't dare to offend her.

473
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,329
You can offend her all you want. I approve it.

474
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,021
But how was your blind date?

475
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,640
What do you mean?

476
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,762
You're very concerned about my love life, right?

477
00:29:41,419 --> 00:29:44,099
I'm just asking.

478
00:29:44,203 --> 00:29:45,453
I'm curious.

479
00:29:47,104 --> 00:29:48,665
It was great, really great.

480
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,040
I'm very satisfied.

481
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,720
If it weren't for your parents today, I would not be single.

482
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:58,640
Boss, you're so outstanding. This little incident won't affect anything.

483
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:02,870
But I still want to apologize to you on behalf of my parents. I'm sorry.

484
00:30:18,963 --> 00:30:20,623
Madam.

485
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,630
Madam, what's wrong? Don't cry.

486
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,930
Madam.

487
00:30:29,391 --> 00:30:33,411
The girl who went on a blind date with Qian Heng came to question me.

488
00:30:33,536 --> 00:30:37,022
She said Qian Heng doesn't like girls at all.

489
00:30:37,304 --> 00:30:40,504
She asked why we arranged a blind date for them.

490
00:30:40,585 --> 00:30:42,141
It's a waste of her time.

491
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,020
But according to what my boss said,

492
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,860
they both seemed to like each other.

493
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,002
My foot.

494
00:30:47,116 --> 00:30:51,897
This girl insists that there must be something wrong with Qian Heng.

495
00:30:52,056 --> 00:30:54,795
So, they parted ways.

496
00:30:57,342 --> 00:30:58,440
(Parted ways?)

497
00:30:58,652 --> 00:31:01,092
(So, he wasn't satisfied with that girl.)

498
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:03,683
(Then, why did he say that? Is he mad at me?)

499
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,181
(What are you spacing out for?)

500
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,261
(I acted so hard.)

501
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,090
Madam.

502
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,610
Cheng Yao.

503
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,440
You and Qian Heng live together.

504
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,322
Didn't you find any clues at all?

505
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:24,899
I really didn't find any clue about him having such a problem.

506
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,780
Did that girl misunderstand?

507
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,900
How could this happen?

508
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,260
I'm still worried.

509
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,430
Cheng Yao,

510
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:37,562
can you do me a favor?

511
00:31:37,735 --> 00:31:39,722
Help me investigate

512
00:31:39,888 --> 00:31:43,099
whether there's something wrong with Qian Heng.

513
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:48,979
Madam. I really want to help you, but this is his privacy.

514
00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:52,002
After all, I am a subordinate. I can't find out about this.

515
00:31:52,241 --> 00:31:53,761
How much money did Qian Heng give you?

516
00:31:53,868 --> 00:31:55,247
I'll give you three times that.

517
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,882
I am your boss now. Is this okay?

518
00:31:57,964 --> 00:31:59,324
It's not about the money.

519
00:31:59,694 --> 00:32:03,882
Besides, this kind of thing is a person's privacy and freedom.

520
00:32:04,249 --> 00:32:05,630
I really can't ask him that.

521
00:32:08,184 --> 00:32:09,943
- Then, what should we do? - Madam.

522
00:32:10,058 --> 00:32:11,879
Can you please help me?

523
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,941
Don't treat yourself as a subordinate.

524
00:32:14,121 --> 00:32:17,901
Just treat yourself as my bestie.

525
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:19,394
Is that okay?

526
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,660
Can you do me a favor?

527
00:32:21,843 --> 00:32:23,093
I promise

528
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,757
I will respect Qian Heng's choices.

529
00:32:25,913 --> 00:32:27,163
I support him in everything.

530
00:32:27,944 --> 00:32:30,803
But I have the right

531
00:32:31,111 --> 00:32:33,331
to know the truth, right?

532
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,901
Let me try.

533
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,769
I knew you would agree to my request. You're a good girl.

534
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:55,019
Here, I've prepared the tools for investigation for you.

535
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,660
Please. Thank you.

536
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,021
Come on. Let's have some tea.

537
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,362
Where should I put it?

538
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,817
Let me take a picture and send it to Madam.

539
00:33:24,841 --> 00:33:26,091
It should be fine.

540
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:30,210
Okay. That's it.

541
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,170
Boss.

542
00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:51,340
I can explain.

543
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,779
You don't have to explain.

544
00:33:54,538 --> 00:33:56,458
You sneaked into my room

545
00:33:56,546 --> 00:34:00,442
just to see if I have contacted that girl on the blind date

546
00:34:00,523 --> 00:34:01,962
and if I've got a gift, right?

547
00:34:06,663 --> 00:34:08,381
Don't think that just because you've read a few posts online,

548
00:34:08,405 --> 00:34:09,922
you're Sherlock Holmes.

549
00:34:11,364 --> 00:34:12,614
Is there anything else?

550
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:14,389
Nothing.

551
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,330
What is it?

552
00:34:35,036 --> 00:34:36,277
Um...

553
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,019
You young girls have your own unique way of expressing emotions.

554
00:34:40,181 --> 00:34:41,431
I can understand that.

555
00:34:41,633 --> 00:34:43,014
Of course, I can also understand

556
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,520
that sometimes you can't control your emotions

557
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:48,300
and want to tell me your inner thoughts passionately.

558
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:49,958
This is not your fault.

559
00:34:50,281 --> 00:34:54,162
But I still hope you can restrain yourself and learn to control yourself.

560
00:34:55,185 --> 00:34:56,265
Boss, don't worry.

561
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,260
I will definitely control myself in the future

562
00:34:58,290 --> 00:34:59,722
and not cause you any trouble.

563
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,259
What is this?

564
00:35:06,147 --> 00:35:07,628
This is for you.

565
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,920
They say it's good for your health when you drink it.

566
00:35:10,163 --> 00:35:11,413
Okay.

567
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,722
(Cordyceps and Mutton Soup)

568
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,610
What do you mean?

569
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,728
(Madam Qian.)

570
00:35:33,962 --> 00:35:37,160
(Before you prepared these props, couldn't you have told me first?)

571
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,550
Well...

572
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:48,282
Sorry, boss. Can I take a call?

573
00:35:48,445 --> 00:35:49,695
Sure.

574
00:35:50,459 --> 00:35:52,920
- Ting Ting, what's wrong? - (Yao Yao.)

575
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,189
- (I'm done for.) - What do you mean?

576
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,359
What happened?

577
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,690
Where are you?

578
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,200
Ting Ting.

579
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,320
Sorry, boss. I need to go out for a bit. My friend is in a bad situation.

580
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,402
Cheng Yao. I'll give you a ride. Get in the car.

581
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,070
Thank you, boss.

582
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,631
- Where are we going? - Suling River.

583
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,500
I heard her crying on the phone.

584
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,640
Do you know what happened?

585
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,740
I have no idea.

586
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,219
It seems like she's been drinking.

587
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,399
A pregnant woman shouldn't drink, right?

588
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,282
Li Meng Ting, what are you doing?

589
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:13,188
What's wrong? You're pregnant, all right?

590
00:37:16,364 --> 00:37:17,614
What's wrong?

591
00:37:18,418 --> 00:37:20,118
It's okay. Don't cry.

592
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,640
Hao Zi will feel sorry for you when he sees you like this.

593
00:37:24,121 --> 00:37:26,022
He doesn't want me anymore.

594
00:37:26,886 --> 00:37:29,146
He doesn't want our children anymore.

595
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,103
Hao Zi and his female colleague are together now.

596
00:37:44,388 --> 00:37:46,907
All the overtime he told me about was just a lie.

597
00:37:47,019 --> 00:37:49,722
He was actually going to a hotel with the mistress.

598
00:37:50,365 --> 00:37:52,585
Now, he wants to break up with me

599
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,360
and doesn't want our children anymore.

600
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,520
This is how my life will be.

601
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,440
I'm just so sorry for my two children.

602
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,882
I hope they won't meet a useless mother like me in their next life.

603
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,679
Li Meng Ting, what are you saying?

604
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:13,362
If you die now, wouldn't it be what they want?

605
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,644
Ten years later, when they live a happy and successful life,

606
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,136
who will remember you?

607
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:20,859
If something happens to you, only your parents will be sad for you.

608
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,120
All right.

609
00:38:28,587 --> 00:38:30,168
Did you forget that I am a lawyer?

610
00:38:30,774 --> 00:38:33,644
If Zhang Hao really wronged you, I won't let him get away with it.

611
00:38:44,499 --> 00:38:46,042
You are in your pregnancy.

612
00:38:46,206 --> 00:38:47,906
It's normal to have unstable emotions.

613
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,070
Let's go back first

614
00:38:50,151 --> 00:38:52,891
and have a talk with Zhang Hao to clarify things.

615
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,030
Okay.

616
00:38:59,939 --> 00:39:03,140
When you're feeling down, drinking something warm can help.

617
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,850
Here's some milk.

618
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,370
Thank you, boss.

619
00:39:10,624 --> 00:39:11,864
I'll take Ting Ting home later.

620
00:39:11,962 --> 00:39:13,482
I won't take up any more of your time.

621
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,099
I'll go with you guys.

622
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,715
No need. We still don't know how things will turn out.

623
00:39:17,817 --> 00:39:19,539
- What if... - No way.

624
00:39:19,668 --> 00:39:22,349
It's not safe for two girls to go negotiate.

625
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:25,540
No need.

626
00:39:26,371 --> 00:39:27,621
Put this on.

627
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,970
Take her to the car.

628
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,290
Let's go, Ting Ting.

629
00:39:38,139 --> 00:39:39,389
Come on.

630
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,682
- I'll send you guys up. - No need, boss.

631
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:58,522
We can go by ourselves, boss. You can go home first.

632
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,136
I'll wait for you in the car then.

633
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,002
No need. I'll figure out a way to get back later.

634
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,520
In case you can't reach an agreement,

635
00:40:05,619 --> 00:40:08,380
it's inconvenient for you to hail a car with a pregnant woman around.

636
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,500
Thank you, boss.

637
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,309
If you feel tired later, you can go back first.

638
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,941
Don't worry. I'm here.

639
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,279
Honey. It's cold outside. Wear more clothes.

640
00:40:50,184 --> 00:40:53,535
- I just left and you brought someone home. - Meng Ting.

641
00:40:53,629 --> 00:40:55,979
- Who are you? - Let go.

642
00:40:56,059 --> 00:40:57,780
Get out of here. This is my house.

643
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:00,701
He doesn't love you anymore. What's the point of clinging to him?

644
00:41:00,781 --> 00:41:02,099
You shameless mistress.

645
00:41:02,241 --> 00:41:03,821
How much do you really know about him?

646
00:41:04,099 --> 00:41:06,777
How busy is he in his company? Do you know that? You don't know.

647
00:41:06,861 --> 00:41:08,840
All you do is spend money at home all day.

648
00:41:09,019 --> 00:41:10,539
Do you know he went to see a doctor?

649
00:41:10,691 --> 00:41:12,236
And he was diagnosed with severe depression.

650
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,023
Do you know? He doesn't love you anymore.

651
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:16,002
Why do you still cling to him?

652
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,550
- Let go of me. - Enough.

653
00:41:21,324 --> 00:41:22,563
She's pregnant now.

654
00:41:22,659 --> 00:41:25,762
If you touch her again, I'll make sure you will bear legal responsibility.

655
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:30,309
And you, hiding behind like this, are such a coward.

656
00:41:33,459 --> 00:41:34,559
Li Meng Ting.

657
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,261
Let's part on good terms. Don't make it ugly, okay?

658
00:41:37,342 --> 00:41:38,592
Zhang Hao.

659
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,676
You are the one who did something wrong.

660
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,181
What do you mean by saying this now?

661
00:41:42,386 --> 00:41:44,660
Yes, I have fallen for someone else.

662
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:47,660
That's my fault. But ask yourself. Are you not at fault?

663
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:48,953
What problem do I have?

664
00:41:49,082 --> 00:41:50,556
It was you who advised me to quit my job

665
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,940
and become a full-time housewife.

666
00:41:52,102 --> 00:41:55,204
Now, you're turning around and saying I'm not ambitious.

667
00:41:55,498 --> 00:41:57,145
Has your conscience been eaten by a dog?

668
00:41:57,245 --> 00:41:58,524
Yes, I said it.

669
00:41:58,659 --> 00:42:01,104
If you can really take care of the household well at home,

670
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,266
there's no problem.

671
00:42:02,379 --> 00:42:04,628
But besides online shopping at home, you're not doing anything else.

672
00:42:04,652 --> 00:42:06,667
You're disconnected from society. Do you know that?

673
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:09,199
Between you and me, we have less and less common topics.

674
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,056
When I talk to you about the workplace and work,

675
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,442
you don't understand a thing.

676
00:42:12,693 --> 00:42:14,873
Do you know how much pressure I'm under?

677
00:42:16,579 --> 00:42:18,019
For the sake of Zhang Hao's face,

678
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:21,320
you should abort the child in your stomach and apologize to me.

679
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,500
And I can withdraw my lawsuit

680
00:42:23,811 --> 00:42:26,447
and not hold it against you for violating my privacy.

681
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:27,836
Privacy?

682
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,060
Didn't your best friend tell you?

683
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,597
She had someone secretly take photos of me and Zhang Hao

684
00:42:32,621 --> 00:42:35,082
and send them to my boss and colleagues at the company.

685
00:42:35,539 --> 00:42:37,279
You violated my privacy rights.

686
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:38,869
I can sue you anytime.

687
00:43:06,356 --> 00:43:08,242
Boss, sorry for keeping you waiting.

688
00:43:08,802 --> 00:43:10,052
How did the negotiation go?

689
00:43:11,837 --> 00:43:13,087
Not too well.
