1
00:01:35,492 --> 00:01:38,922
(My Boss)

2
00:01:39,686 --> 00:01:42,580
(Episode 24)

3
00:01:42,661 --> 00:01:45,722
(My boyfriend is so talkative!)

4
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,762
I'm so happy today.

5
00:02:05,576 --> 00:02:07,682
We didn't do anything,

6
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:09,402
so I hope you won't feel bored.

7
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,756
No.

8
00:02:10,951 --> 00:02:13,242
Being with you is good enough.

9
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:19,822
I'm going home, then.

10
00:02:19,903 --> 00:02:21,574
Thanks for sending me back.

11
00:02:22,198 --> 00:02:25,029
This song is nice. Why not finish listening to it before you leave?

12
00:04:11,901 --> 00:04:14,962
I still need to work tomorrow. I'll go back first.

13
00:04:15,282 --> 00:04:17,681
Why don't I go upstairs and help you fix the lights?

14
00:04:17,851 --> 00:04:18,962
I fixed it.

15
00:04:19,072 --> 00:04:20,292
You fixed it?

16
00:04:21,042 --> 00:04:22,482
Should I go and check it again?

17
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:37,562
It's bad if I do something offensive to him.

18
00:04:38,902 --> 00:04:40,202
There's no need.

19
00:04:42,945 --> 00:04:44,562
Yao Yao, wait...

20
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,859
What's wrong?

21
00:04:48,127 --> 00:04:50,186
- Did you pinch your hand? - I'm fine.

22
00:04:50,719 --> 00:04:51,988
Is there a fracture?

23
00:04:52,069 --> 00:04:54,631
No. Look. It's not swollen and there's no change in color.

24
00:04:56,553 --> 00:04:58,133
All right. It's fine. Go back.

25
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,922
- Does it hurt? - Not at all.

26
00:05:01,586 --> 00:05:03,122
I'm leaving then.

27
00:05:04,622 --> 00:05:06,002
- Bye. - Bye.

28
00:05:12,366 --> 00:05:13,680
Are you really fine?

29
00:05:13,815 --> 00:05:16,326
I'm really fine. Look. It's fine.

30
00:05:17,975 --> 00:05:19,375
Be careful when you go home.

31
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,602
All right.

32
00:05:35,774 --> 00:05:37,164
It hurts so much!

33
00:06:09,398 --> 00:06:11,575
(I asked you to amend the prenuptial agreement draft previously.)

34
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:12,819
(Have you done it?)

35
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:18,431
(Are you sure you want to talk about this with me at 11pm?)

36
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,356
(I want to meet you.)

37
00:06:26,048 --> 00:06:28,798
(Sleep early. I'll meet you in your dream.)

38
00:06:59,431 --> 00:07:00,762
Let's eat.

39
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,402
It's so big.

40
00:07:03,576 --> 00:07:06,045
Oh, well...

41
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,020
Eat.

42
00:07:13,881 --> 00:07:15,391
Deng Ming will not harass me again.

43
00:07:16,802 --> 00:07:18,461
I'm a female warrior.

44
00:07:19,098 --> 00:07:20,408
I'm not a pushover.

45
00:07:21,602 --> 00:07:22,822
That's great.

46
00:07:24,464 --> 00:07:25,974
Why did you

47
00:07:27,042 --> 00:07:28,682
come and find me at this time?

48
00:07:29,022 --> 00:07:30,642
It's been so long since I ate with you

49
00:07:30,719 --> 00:07:32,962
so I ordered this delicious pizza today.

50
00:07:33,423 --> 00:07:34,643
Really?

51
00:07:35,673 --> 00:07:36,893
I don't think so.

52
00:07:37,255 --> 00:07:38,605
Why not?

53
00:07:40,121 --> 00:07:41,602
Something's wrong.

54
00:07:48,306 --> 00:07:49,526
(Let's have dinner tonight.)

55
00:07:51,302 --> 00:07:52,922
I'm at my sister's house.

56
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,522
Let me give you a couple of elephants.

57
00:08:01,485 --> 00:08:02,755
What couple?

58
00:08:04,992 --> 00:08:06,212
This.

59
00:08:10,096 --> 00:08:11,316
Yao Yao.

60
00:08:12,602 --> 00:08:14,522
Do you have something to tell me?

61
00:08:14,665 --> 00:08:16,768
- I don't. - You don't?

62
00:08:16,937 --> 00:08:18,882
Are you sure?

63
00:08:19,168 --> 00:08:20,562
I'll go and ask Qian Heng then.

64
00:08:20,805 --> 00:08:22,156
I'll tell you.

65
00:08:24,691 --> 00:08:26,171
I'm in a relationship with Qian Heng.

66
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:28,459
Really?

67
00:08:30,151 --> 00:08:32,282
My younger sister is finally in a relationship.

68
00:08:33,832 --> 00:08:35,422
But he is my boss.

69
00:08:35,861 --> 00:08:37,081
Don't you think that's bad?

70
00:08:37,239 --> 00:08:39,642
What's bad about that?

71
00:08:40,171 --> 00:08:42,322
Are you both single?

72
00:08:42,507 --> 00:08:45,682
Isn't being in a relationship two people liking each other?

73
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:47,279
It's simple. What's wrong with that?

74
00:08:48,124 --> 00:08:50,782
I'm afraid he won't like me when I'm committed to the relationship.

75
00:08:50,806 --> 00:08:52,197
After all, he is so excellent.

76
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,991
Do I become a fool when it comes to love? Does it run in our genes?

77
00:08:59,855 --> 00:09:01,194
We don't.

78
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:02,962
Back then, I was...

79
00:09:03,804 --> 00:09:05,552
it was because Deng Ming was good at fooling people.

80
00:09:05,576 --> 00:09:06,962
He tricked me.

81
00:09:08,855 --> 00:09:10,175
Qian Heng is excellent

82
00:09:10,256 --> 00:09:12,365
but you are also very excellent.

83
00:09:14,104 --> 00:09:15,534
Love...

84
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,045
Love is like this bunch of flowers.

85
00:09:23,934 --> 00:09:25,362
Flowers are nice

86
00:09:25,473 --> 00:09:27,402
but they will wilt one day.

87
00:09:27,631 --> 00:09:30,061
You shouldn't stop buying it because it will wilt.

88
00:09:30,374 --> 00:09:31,574
Flowers will wilt

89
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:35,317
but the fragrance they bring will exist.

90
00:09:35,832 --> 00:09:37,052
Right?

91
00:09:40,882 --> 00:09:42,082
Yes.

92
00:09:44,581 --> 00:09:47,561
I will do well in this relationship and cherish the present.

93
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:49,362
Yes. Cherish the present.

94
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:52,630
Let's eat. Cheers.

95
00:09:55,681 --> 00:09:57,991
Tell me how did you two get along?

96
00:10:00,012 --> 00:10:01,682
We just got together.

97
00:10:04,641 --> 00:10:06,270
I think this is almost right.

98
00:10:13,786 --> 00:10:15,082
Why are you here?

99
00:10:25,638 --> 00:10:26,948
What's wrong with your hand?

100
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,352
It's nothing.

101
00:10:29,522 --> 00:10:30,716
My finger was pinched.

102
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,037
I didn't feel anything at first

103
00:10:32,062 --> 00:10:34,703
but it hurt a lot and got worse later.

104
00:10:34,819 --> 00:10:36,075
I went to the hospital to take a look.

105
00:10:36,099 --> 00:10:38,928
The doctor said there was serious tissue damage

106
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,735
and my right hand is inconvenient.

107
00:10:40,816 --> 00:10:42,522
However, I'm fine.

108
00:10:42,895 --> 00:10:44,922
- So serious? - It's all right.

109
00:10:48,303 --> 00:10:49,782
You should stop working.

110
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,140
Let your hand rest.

111
00:10:53,155 --> 00:10:54,577
Are you hungry? Let me cook for you.

112
00:10:54,601 --> 00:10:55,821
Sure.

113
00:10:56,193 --> 00:10:57,413
Rest your hand for a while.

114
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,900
What are you doing?

115
00:11:28,451 --> 00:11:29,602
Nothing.

116
00:11:29,719 --> 00:11:31,069
I just want to look at you more.

117
00:11:31,601 --> 00:11:33,601
You have to go back after I finish eating.

118
00:11:33,788 --> 00:11:36,201
You shouldn't drive with your injury.

119
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:37,595
Tonight...

120
00:11:38,352 --> 00:11:40,922
Just stay here temporarily for tonight.

121
00:11:42,832 --> 00:11:44,162
That's not right.

122
00:11:44,968 --> 00:11:47,518
Fine, I'll stay here for one night.

123
00:11:59,808 --> 00:12:01,028
Time to eat.

124
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,540
Coming.

125
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,277
It smells nice.

126
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,299
Help yourself. Let me get some rice for you.

127
00:12:12,281 --> 00:12:13,871
I can only use my left hand.

128
00:12:29,522 --> 00:12:30,802
Let me help you.

129
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:33,202
It's fine. I can eat slowly with my left hand.

130
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,510
It's all right.

131
00:12:35,762 --> 00:12:36,982
Give it to me.

132
00:12:43,302 --> 00:12:45,002
- Is it delicious? - Yes.

133
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,722
Why are you looking at me like that?

134
00:12:53,936 --> 00:12:55,156
What's wrong?

135
00:12:55,743 --> 00:12:56,963
Focus on eating.

136
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:20,401
Seriously. I smell like disinfectant after going to the hospital.

137
00:13:20,488 --> 00:13:21,882
What should I do?

138
00:13:22,182 --> 00:13:23,682
Take a bath then.

139
00:13:23,922 --> 00:13:24,922
I...

140
00:13:25,077 --> 00:13:27,482
Right. How can you take a bath with that injury?

141
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:31,042
Yes. I'm also a clean freak. I can't go to sleep if I don't take a bath.

142
00:13:31,665 --> 00:13:33,774
I don't think I can sleep on the bed today.

143
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,770
I have an idea.

144
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,820
Wait for me.

145
00:13:45,104 --> 00:13:47,453
Be careful when you remove it later.

146
00:13:47,616 --> 00:13:49,042
Don't hurt yourself.

147
00:13:51,488 --> 00:13:53,318
All right. Just make do with it.

148
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:55,359
I...

149
00:13:55,745 --> 00:13:56,887
How do I take a bath?

150
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,220
Just like this.

151
00:13:59,162 --> 00:14:00,382
Go on.

152
00:14:08,555 --> 00:14:10,002
This won't do.

153
00:14:13,542 --> 00:14:14,931
I must think of something.

154
00:14:26,847 --> 00:14:28,067
What's wrong?

155
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:31,622
- What's wrong? - Come in!

156
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,150
What's wrong?

157
00:14:37,071 --> 00:14:38,231
It hurts so much.

158
00:14:38,312 --> 00:14:39,791
Why did you remove it?

159
00:14:40,952 --> 00:14:43,887
It was difficult to take off my clothes so I removed it.

160
00:14:43,968 --> 00:14:45,288
I didn't expect to sprain my back

161
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,015
when I took off my clothes. It hurts so much.

162
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,270
What should I do?

163
00:14:48,819 --> 00:14:50,271
Why don't you help me?

164
00:14:50,362 --> 00:14:51,401
Help you?

165
00:14:51,481 --> 00:14:52,701
Yes. Help me.

166
00:14:55,601 --> 00:14:56,821
Come.

167
00:15:19,749 --> 00:15:20,802
What's wrong?

168
00:15:20,913 --> 00:15:22,633
It's no use even if I help you take it off.

169
00:15:23,735 --> 00:15:25,124
You still can't take a bath.

170
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:26,603
You are right.

171
00:15:27,122 --> 00:15:28,503
Should I help you take a bath instead?

172
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:29,562
Sure.

173
00:15:30,928 --> 00:15:32,257
No need. That's not what I meant.

174
00:15:32,338 --> 00:15:34,462
I can take a bath on my own with one hand.

175
00:15:34,772 --> 00:15:36,521
That won't do. I must help you

176
00:15:36,608 --> 00:15:38,402
since your hand is so heavily injured.

177
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,522
Are you still pretending?

178
00:15:44,463 --> 00:15:46,422
I really got hurt. Look.

179
00:15:46,507 --> 00:15:47,882
It hurts a lot.

180
00:15:48,101 --> 00:15:50,442
The color is just richer.

181
00:15:50,523 --> 00:15:51,842
It's exaggerated.

182
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,672
Sorry. I was wrong.

183
00:15:56,966 --> 00:15:58,246
Can you still take a bath?

184
00:15:58,341 --> 00:15:59,426
Yes.

185
00:16:00,535 --> 00:16:01,976
Do it quickly.

186
00:16:02,118 --> 00:16:03,809
I'll put ointment for you when you're done.

187
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,053
All right.

188
00:16:12,424 --> 00:16:13,853
I failed again.

189
00:16:14,903 --> 00:16:16,123
I'm such a failure.

190
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,842
How can you still smile?

191
00:16:28,296 --> 00:16:29,621
Can't you tie it on your own?

192
00:16:29,702 --> 00:16:32,542
It's my first time doing someone else's necktie. I might do it wrongly.

193
00:16:32,832 --> 00:16:34,052
How do I do this?

194
00:16:34,655 --> 00:16:36,486
It's fine. Take your time.

195
00:16:37,136 --> 00:16:38,442
Take your time practicing.

196
00:16:53,849 --> 00:16:55,602
I can't make a good tie.

197
00:16:55,851 --> 00:16:57,162
You should do it yourself.

198
00:16:57,263 --> 00:16:58,613
I'm almost late for work.

199
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,494
I'll tell the admin

200
00:17:01,248 --> 00:17:02,602
that we are working abroad.

201
00:17:03,005 --> 00:17:04,482
What if someone finds out?

202
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:06,006
Who will find out if I don't say it?

203
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,311
I'll try it again.

204
00:17:08,392 --> 00:17:09,612
Try it.

205
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,242
Here. Let me teach you.

206
00:17:22,754 --> 00:17:25,562
Do this. Turn it around.

207
00:17:29,226 --> 00:17:30,281
From here.

208
00:17:30,377 --> 00:17:32,482
Yes. Loop it around.

209
00:17:37,162 --> 00:17:38,382
Yes.

210
00:17:39,562 --> 00:17:41,082
After that, tighten it.

211
00:17:41,577 --> 00:17:43,949
Use both hands. Tighten it.

212
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,752
Hold this position and push it upwards.

213
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,402
Do you know how to do it now?

214
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:54,353
What are you doing?

215
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:55,661
Try it again.

216
00:17:56,338 --> 00:17:57,921
I'm going to be late for work!

217
00:17:59,991 --> 00:18:01,221
I haven't tied my necktie yet.

218
00:18:11,832 --> 00:18:15,268
This is a real case of Jin Ping Mei.

219
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,522
What role do we lawyers play?

220
00:18:17,823 --> 00:18:19,043
Well, I am Wu Song.

221
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:21,587
I regret accepting this case too late.

222
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,882
When I enter the court, I'll say "Sorry, Wu Song is late!"

223
00:18:25,743 --> 00:18:28,263
Justice rains from above, and we are the messengers of justice!

224
00:18:28,437 --> 00:18:30,202
- This is... - What are you talking about?

225
00:18:31,217 --> 00:18:33,002
Don't go.

226
00:18:33,521 --> 00:18:34,741
Let's have a chat.

227
00:18:35,224 --> 00:18:36,444
What were you talking about?

228
00:18:37,402 --> 00:18:38,482
No.

229
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:41,742
We were talking about...

230
00:18:43,054 --> 00:18:44,442
There's a case.

231
00:18:44,783 --> 00:18:46,814
A case you gave us last month.

232
00:18:46,912 --> 00:18:48,221
It's about...

233
00:18:48,642 --> 00:18:50,362
I heard you say

234
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,242
Wu Song is late.

235
00:18:55,288 --> 00:18:56,508
Right?

236
00:18:56,854 --> 00:18:58,074
Wu Song is late?

237
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,642
Limitation periods.

238
00:19:00,216 --> 00:19:01,807
That's right!

239
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,437
Limitation periods.

240
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:05,198
- Limitation periods. - Wu Song is late.

241
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,280
It's not bad.

242
00:19:17,394 --> 00:19:19,042
Keep chatting.

243
00:19:19,207 --> 00:19:20,427
Continue, Wu Song.

244
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,104
Are we still going to talk about it?

245
00:19:26,745 --> 00:19:28,536
Of course. Didn't he ask us to talk about it?

246
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,780
Let's continue.

247
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,240
Where were we?

248
00:19:31,335 --> 00:19:32,555
Wu Song is late.

249
00:19:33,481 --> 00:19:35,002
Why was Wu Song late?

250
00:19:35,534 --> 00:19:38,202
Because Wu Song spent too much time beating up the tiger.

251
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:41,002
It's fine. Spending too much time is fine.

252
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:42,562
Are you really talking about it?

253
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:43,861
Dismissed.

254
00:19:44,087 --> 00:19:45,307
I was shocked.

255
00:19:58,638 --> 00:20:00,109
Time to eat.

256
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,230
Let's eat. There's a lot of food.

257
00:20:02,254 --> 00:20:03,451
- Let's go to the pantry. - Sure.

258
00:20:03,475 --> 00:20:05,135
- Lunch is here. - Lunch is here.

259
00:20:05,216 --> 00:20:07,446
- Here you go. - Let me do it.

260
00:20:08,688 --> 00:20:09,908
Let's go.

261
00:20:11,547 --> 00:20:13,242
Time to eat!

262
00:20:16,121 --> 00:20:17,242
I'm starving.

263
00:20:17,332 --> 00:20:19,777
I only had half a cup of coffee in the morning.

264
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,839
- Why didn't you eat breakfast? - I forgot. I had a contract to settle.

265
00:20:22,957 --> 00:20:25,037
I'll make sure you eat your breakfast in the future.

266
00:20:26,174 --> 00:20:28,404
Enough. It feels like you two are together.

267
00:20:30,992 --> 00:20:32,212
Lawyer Qian.

268
00:20:33,922 --> 00:20:35,082
Boss.

269
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:37,454
We are eating deliveries.

270
00:20:37,535 --> 00:20:38,642
Let's eat together.

271
00:20:43,988 --> 00:20:45,641
Boss, I'm sure you want to eat outside.

272
00:20:45,722 --> 00:20:46,802
Sure.

273
00:20:52,137 --> 00:20:53,242
Not bad.

274
00:20:55,392 --> 00:20:56,472
Boss.

275
00:20:56,808 --> 00:20:58,446
We are eating something rich.

276
00:20:58,527 --> 00:20:59,988
I'm sure you can't get used to eating this.

277
00:21:00,012 --> 00:21:02,229
It's fine. I like rich food.

278
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:10,752
- Are you all right? - I'm fine.

279
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,325
Let me taste it first.

280
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,980
It's not salty. It's quite light in fact.

281
00:21:20,143 --> 00:21:22,583
- Let me help you open it. - It's fine. I can do it myself.

282
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:27,002
Why are you spacing out?

283
00:21:30,924 --> 00:21:32,198
- It's all right. - Sorry.

284
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:33,522
I'm fine.

285
00:21:34,281 --> 00:21:36,280
I can just wipe it away on a black suit.

286
00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:37,722
It's all right.

287
00:21:38,001 --> 00:21:39,221
Let's eat.

288
00:21:40,414 --> 00:21:41,634
Use mine.

289
00:21:41,792 --> 00:21:43,012
Thank you, boss.

290
00:21:43,312 --> 00:21:45,422
You are so nice. Let's eat.

291
00:21:49,255 --> 00:21:50,475
Let's eat.

292
00:21:50,752 --> 00:21:52,262
Let's eat.

293
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,282
- Didn't I ask you to wait for me? - When?

294
00:22:18,402 --> 00:22:19,562
I didn't see it.

295
00:22:19,711 --> 00:22:20,931
You do now.

296
00:22:27,531 --> 00:22:30,362
- I'm not eating hotpot. I have pimples. - Exactly.

297
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,498
Boss. Cheng Yao.

298
00:22:45,433 --> 00:22:46,783
Boss. Cheng Yao.

299
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:48,863
Are you waiting for the lift too?

300
00:22:52,006 --> 00:22:56,322
Oh, Tan Ying. Didn't we agree to go to the mall together today?

301
00:22:58,167 --> 00:22:59,235
Yes.

302
00:22:59,316 --> 00:23:02,375
I asked Cheng Yao to help me buy a birthday present for my mother

303
00:23:02,456 --> 00:23:03,856
because I had trouble choosing one.

304
00:23:04,478 --> 00:23:05,867
Do you need Cheng Yao to help you?

305
00:23:06,921 --> 00:23:08,141
It's nothing.

306
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:56,391
Goodbye, Lawyer Qian.

307
00:23:59,281 --> 00:24:00,512
You owe me a cup of milk tea.

308
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,990
He asked you to take a taxi and work overtime, right?

309
00:24:04,325 --> 00:24:05,682
Thankfully, I reacted quickly.

310
00:24:05,869 --> 00:24:07,339
Otherwise, you'll suffer tonight.

311
00:24:09,807 --> 00:24:11,027
I'm leaving.

312
00:24:14,961 --> 00:24:16,181
You're welcome!

313
00:24:18,652 --> 00:24:20,121
Did Lawyer Qian realize anything?

314
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,041
Didn't he see you holding two bags?

315
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:24,080
Two bags...

316
00:24:24,721 --> 00:24:27,246
It's loving for colleagues to help each other.

317
00:24:27,327 --> 00:24:28,847
What's the problem? No problem at all.

318
00:24:29,922 --> 00:24:32,548
- Fine. - See? It'll be fine if you say so.

319
00:24:32,629 --> 00:24:34,042
My girlfriend is smart, sharp,

320
00:24:34,153 --> 00:24:35,543
and has good judgment.

321
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,549
There aren't any logical flaws.

322
00:24:44,672 --> 00:24:46,061
My girlfriend said it was fine.

323
00:24:46,142 --> 00:24:47,362
There should be no problem.

324
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:50,261
No problem.

325
00:24:50,616 --> 00:24:51,836
Is it really so?

326
00:24:53,441 --> 00:24:54,661
No problem.

327
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:02,796
What are you doing?

328
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,499
Roasting durian.

329
00:25:08,368 --> 00:25:09,757
Roasting durian?

330
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:11,939
What did these durians do wrong?

331
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,391
Didn't you say you want to eat roasted durian on Weibo?

332
00:25:14,522 --> 00:25:16,042
I was just saying.

333
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,151
Although they are burnt, I'm still touched.

334
00:25:22,304 --> 00:25:23,584
It doesn't sound sincere at all.

335
00:25:32,362 --> 00:25:34,042
I didn't leave work together with you

336
00:25:34,122 --> 00:25:36,382
because I went to the mall and bought you something.

337
00:25:38,683 --> 00:25:41,682
What do you think? A gift for being officially in a relationship.

338
00:25:45,897 --> 00:25:47,117
Let me see.

339
00:25:47,273 --> 00:25:48,362
Here.

340
00:25:49,567 --> 00:25:50,787
Do you like it?

341
00:25:51,744 --> 00:25:52,964
Not bad.

342
00:25:53,441 --> 00:25:54,661
How do I tie it?

343
00:25:56,106 --> 00:25:57,402
I just taught you.

344
00:25:57,483 --> 00:25:59,264
Fine. I'm sure you can't do it.

345
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:02,722
Don't think I didn't realize

346
00:26:02,793 --> 00:26:04,873
the fact that you've been avoiding me the whole day.

347
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:06,897
I was nervous.

348
00:26:07,456 --> 00:26:08,722
Why did you feel nervous?

349
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:11,908
I'm afraid everyone knows that we are in a relationship.

350
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,082
Why?

351
00:26:13,481 --> 00:26:16,072
You are the boss, and I'm a rookie.

352
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,687
I just want to do well in my work

353
00:26:17,711 --> 00:26:19,340
and don't want any extra attention.

354
00:26:22,162 --> 00:26:23,382
Enough.

355
00:26:25,395 --> 00:26:27,706
Sorry. It's my fault.

356
00:26:28,574 --> 00:26:30,284
It's my first time in a relationship too.

357
00:26:30,774 --> 00:26:32,405
I only want to be by your side

358
00:26:32,732 --> 00:26:34,532
and didn't consider the matter for your sake.

359
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:37,410
If you think exposing our relationship makes you feel uncomfortable,

360
00:26:37,434 --> 00:26:38,871
I'll be discreet in the firm

361
00:26:38,952 --> 00:26:40,392
so they don't realize it, all right?

362
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:46,441
However, I did deal with it in a stiff manner.

363
00:26:46,536 --> 00:26:47,756
Right?

364
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:49,136
It's quite stiff indeed.

365
00:26:49,371 --> 00:26:51,130
However, my acting skills are perfect.

366
00:26:51,296 --> 00:26:53,282
I can't say the same about yours.

367
00:26:54,929 --> 00:26:57,122
Why don't I let you attend an acting crash course?

368
00:26:58,455 --> 00:27:01,122
I'm joking. Why would I let you attend an acting crash course?

369
00:27:01,238 --> 00:27:03,542
It's not something that a crash course can solve.

370
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,449
You are so annoying.

371
00:27:06,087 --> 00:27:07,307
What do we do with these?

372
00:27:09,441 --> 00:27:10,522
Are you going to eat them?

373
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:11,861
No.

374
00:27:12,157 --> 00:27:13,377
Clean the table.

375
00:27:19,922 --> 00:27:21,042
Come in.

376
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:24,750
The courier just sent a parcel.

377
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:25,922
It's yours.

378
00:27:28,095 --> 00:27:29,522
Just leave it there.

379
00:27:30,711 --> 00:27:33,181
What is it? The box is so big.

380
00:27:33,792 --> 00:27:36,121
Information I bought from overseas.

381
00:27:36,247 --> 00:27:37,602
The packaging is too complicated.

382
00:27:38,183 --> 00:27:40,121
Take your time reading it. I'm going to wash up.

383
00:27:40,224 --> 00:27:41,444
Sure.

384
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:11,322
(How to be in a relationship at the office)

385
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:49,079
(Classic family cases in the last 10 years)

386
00:29:19,895 --> 00:29:21,115
Wu Jun.

387
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,122
Cheng Xi, what a coincidence.

388
00:29:24,551 --> 00:29:26,981
It's not. Aren't you waiting for me here?

389
00:29:30,041 --> 00:29:31,681
I didn't dare contact you these two days.

390
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,630
- I was afraid that you'd think I'm annoying. - Why would I?

391
00:29:35,164 --> 00:29:37,162
Didn't you get injured because of me?

392
00:29:41,294 --> 00:29:42,514
Wu Jun,

393
00:29:42,815 --> 00:29:44,485
I know you care about me

394
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,900
and worry about me.

395
00:29:46,961 --> 00:29:48,841
So, I've thought about it in the last two days.

396
00:29:49,335 --> 00:29:50,442
Well,

397
00:29:50,801 --> 00:29:52,962
let's download an app on our phones

398
00:29:53,488 --> 00:29:54,881
to share our locations.

399
00:29:55,027 --> 00:29:57,441
Then, you'll know where I am at any time

400
00:29:57,551 --> 00:30:00,082
and no longer need to be worried. All right?

401
00:30:00,277 --> 00:30:02,262
However, it can only be used in emergencies.

402
00:30:02,343 --> 00:30:03,402
All right?

403
00:30:04,042 --> 00:30:05,922
Give me your phone. Let me download it for you.

404
00:30:08,201 --> 00:30:09,421
What a fool.

405
00:30:22,441 --> 00:30:23,762
What are you doing?

406
00:30:24,151 --> 00:30:26,632
Didn't you say you'd be discreet at the firm?

407
00:30:26,832 --> 00:30:28,552
I haven't seen you in the last three hours.

408
00:30:28,616 --> 00:30:29,836
Isn't that discreet?

409
00:30:31,792 --> 00:30:34,162
Your first cup of milk tea after we are together. Try it.

410
00:30:38,401 --> 00:30:39,621
Is it delicious?

411
00:30:41,287 --> 00:30:42,642
I want to drink it too.

412
00:31:02,785 --> 00:31:05,505
Zhu, have you been busy recently? You have so many files to archive.

413
00:31:05,585 --> 00:31:06,962
- Yes. - It's so tiring.

414
00:31:08,879 --> 00:31:11,721
I need a team building to recharge and relax.

415
00:31:11,802 --> 00:31:13,022
It's true.

416
00:31:13,192 --> 00:31:16,512
- Cheng Yao, you are here too? - Yes. Tao Ying and Zhu.

417
00:31:16,796 --> 00:31:18,762
Has the team building venue been decided?

418
00:31:18,887 --> 00:31:21,002
Not yet. I'm waiting for Lawyer Qian's notice.

419
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,592
It's hard to grasp his intentions.

420
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,562
He just does whatever he wants.

421
00:31:25,761 --> 00:31:27,829
However, it's good enough to have fun.

422
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:31,082
Having fun outside is better than going into Lawyer Qian's office.

423
00:31:31,824 --> 00:31:33,675
Cheng Yao has the authority to speak about this.

424
00:31:33,699 --> 00:31:36,222
She is always the one being tortured the most by Lawyer Qian.

425
00:31:36,303 --> 00:31:37,533
Right, Cheng Yao?

426
00:31:39,465 --> 00:31:41,082
Actually... It's not bad.

427
00:31:41,207 --> 00:31:44,312
After all, it's my honor to be guided by the boss personally.

428
00:31:45,182 --> 00:31:46,882
Why did you give such a formal answer?

429
00:31:47,121 --> 00:31:49,423
Didn't you have a sharp tongue when you complained about him?

430
00:31:49,447 --> 00:31:51,202
What did you always say?

431
00:31:52,106 --> 00:31:54,441
Look how badly Cheng Yao has been tortured.

432
00:31:54,521 --> 00:31:55,802
She's feeling heaty.

433
00:31:55,992 --> 00:31:57,392
Perhaps the weather is dry.

434
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,028
Yes. My throat feels itchy.

435
00:31:59,647 --> 00:32:01,362
Drink more hot water, then.

436
00:32:01,895 --> 00:32:03,915
Drink less milk tea. I won't order for you again.

437
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:18,482
Do you usually complain about me with them?

438
00:32:19,526 --> 00:32:23,642
Before we got together, I complained a little.

439
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:26,602
I hope so.

440
00:32:27,481 --> 00:32:29,731
- Otherwise... - What?

441
00:32:29,883 --> 00:32:31,301
Deduct my bonus?

442
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,762
I can't do anything.

443
00:32:36,449 --> 00:32:37,842
Are you threatening me?

444
00:32:42,162 --> 00:32:43,382
I'm leaving.

445
00:32:43,788 --> 00:32:45,008
Good girl.

446
00:33:03,001 --> 00:33:04,221
I'm home.

447
00:33:10,928 --> 00:33:12,398
(What is trust?)

448
00:33:12,526 --> 00:33:14,002
(This is trust.)

449
00:33:14,253 --> 00:33:18,722
(My Cheng Xi is showing me her location 24 hours a day.)

450
00:33:18,927 --> 00:33:20,917
(Why do you act like a stalker?)

451
00:33:23,689 --> 00:33:25,586
(A single person like you will never understand.)

452
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:29,072
(We have opened our hearts and are very close.)

453
00:33:29,335 --> 00:33:30,965
Are you chatting with Lawyer Wu?

454
00:33:31,881 --> 00:33:33,101
Is it that obvious?

455
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:35,682
Look at your expression.

456
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:41,762
Come.

457
00:33:46,499 --> 00:33:48,139
Why did you take a photo all of a sudden?

458
00:33:48,847 --> 00:33:50,680
The first step of improving a relationship.

459
00:33:50,784 --> 00:33:52,864
Take a picture together and set it as the wallpaper.

460
00:33:53,128 --> 00:33:55,767
No! What if other people see it when you are outside?

461
00:33:55,848 --> 00:33:57,017
No. I took the picture already.

462
00:33:57,041 --> 00:33:58,578
- No. - I won't let other people find out.

463
00:33:58,602 --> 00:33:59,641
No. We are lawyers.

464
00:33:59,721 --> 00:34:01,282
- We must avoid all risks. - No.

465
00:34:01,363 --> 00:34:03,282
I already took the picture.

466
00:34:04,089 --> 00:34:05,309
I already took it.

467
00:34:11,722 --> 00:34:14,521
Why do I feel you're like an old house on fire?

468
00:34:14,632 --> 00:34:15,922
Your love burns so brightly.

469
00:34:16,682 --> 00:34:18,722
I have a reasonable doubt that you are scolding me.

470
00:34:18,815 --> 00:34:20,202
Are you saying that I'm old?

471
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:21,802
How are you old?

472
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,642
I'm the old one. I...

473
00:34:24,242 --> 00:34:25,441
I'm robbing the cradle.

474
00:34:25,536 --> 00:34:26,642
You...

475
00:34:30,972 --> 00:34:32,642
Fine. Let's take it slow.

476
00:34:32,722 --> 00:34:35,816
Let me be independent on my job first, at least.

477
00:34:35,897 --> 00:34:36,922
All right?

478
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:48,362
You beat up people sneakily

479
00:34:48,584 --> 00:34:50,334
and engage in a lawsuit sneakily.

480
00:34:50,807 --> 00:34:53,722
Do you think snatching another's case is a proud thing to do?

481
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,780
If I hit you from the back, it's a sneaky act.

482
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:58,711
If I hit you from the front, I'm doing the public a favor. Understand?

483
00:34:59,128 --> 00:35:01,889
Besides, losing the trial is the only thing that I won't be proud of.

484
00:35:02,682 --> 00:35:05,751
I don't know what despicable tricks you used to steal my client.

485
00:35:06,714 --> 00:35:09,872
All clients want lawyers who can help them win cases.

486
00:35:10,407 --> 00:35:12,117
Don't you know that?

487
00:35:14,256 --> 00:35:17,776
I don't think you do. You should back to school and revise.

488
00:35:23,165 --> 00:35:24,385
Don't call yourself Wu Jun.

489
00:35:25,321 --> 00:35:26,681
Call yourself "Shameless" instead.

490
00:35:34,638 --> 00:35:35,858
Are you looking for me?

491
00:35:37,561 --> 00:35:38,992
Is there a new case?

492
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,007
Didn't you say you want to be independent?

493
00:35:41,031 --> 00:35:42,251
So soon?

494
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,162
I have two cases for you to choose from.

495
00:35:44,582 --> 00:35:46,502
One of them is recommended by my regular client.

496
00:35:47,112 --> 00:35:49,869
It's a family property insurance dispute with an amount of 10 million yuan.

497
00:35:49,893 --> 00:35:52,049
It's something you haven't done before. It's worth challenging.

498
00:35:52,073 --> 00:35:54,712
The other case is a legal aid case arranged by the Legal Aid Center.

499
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:56,736
- The client... - I'm taking the legal aid case.

500
00:35:57,861 --> 00:35:59,922
Sure. I'll send you the case later.

501
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,522
Why didn't you persuade me to take the 10 million yuan case?

502
00:36:04,878 --> 00:36:07,511
After all, you won't get any profit from the legal aid case.

503
00:36:07,693 --> 00:36:09,644
It won't contribute to the firm's income.

504
00:36:12,175 --> 00:36:13,602
However, I chose the legal aid case

505
00:36:13,682 --> 00:36:15,682
because I want to use my identity as a lawyer

506
00:36:15,766 --> 00:36:17,442
to help the people who need it.

507
00:36:17,601 --> 00:36:19,682
I think it is more meaningful to me

508
00:36:19,763 --> 00:36:21,362
compared to accepting bigger cases.

509
00:36:23,042 --> 00:36:25,454
I also hope to use this opportunity to realize my wish

510
00:36:25,535 --> 00:36:26,755
to handle a case on my own.

511
00:36:28,312 --> 00:36:29,551
Let me remind you.

512
00:36:29,667 --> 00:36:31,521
Legal aid cases have many hidden risks.

513
00:36:31,601 --> 00:36:33,782
You might be harassed so you must be careful.

514
00:36:33,863 --> 00:36:35,022
Don't worry.

515
00:36:35,112 --> 00:36:36,713
I've been handling cases under your guidance.

516
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:37,957
You've protected me too well.

517
00:36:38,619 --> 00:36:40,819
This is a good opportunity to experience some hardship.

518
00:36:40,882 --> 00:36:42,361
You must never help me.

519
00:36:42,495 --> 00:36:44,216
You shouldn't ask Bao to help me in secret.

520
00:36:44,351 --> 00:36:45,762
Dream on.

521
00:36:46,424 --> 00:36:49,282
I won't pay attention to unprofitable cases in secret.

522
00:36:53,917 --> 00:36:57,271
If you don't have enough budget for this legal aid case,

523
00:36:58,261 --> 00:37:00,191
I'll subsidize the rest of your expenses.

524
00:37:00,362 --> 00:37:01,631
There's a subsidy as well?

525
00:37:01,809 --> 00:37:03,029
What are you thinking of?

526
00:37:03,543 --> 00:37:06,202
I'm subsidizing you as your boyfriend.

527
00:37:08,402 --> 00:37:11,072
I won't interfere with your freedom to handle the case

528
00:37:11,282 --> 00:37:12,482
but you must remember

529
00:37:12,722 --> 00:37:14,922
that I'll always pay attention from behind you.

530
00:37:18,264 --> 00:37:19,904
Is there a tax reduction for the subsidy?

531
00:37:21,175 --> 00:37:23,392
Is that all you care about?

532
00:37:23,526 --> 00:37:25,416
Are you transferring to my Alipay or WeChat Pay?

533
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,419
Do I need to apply for a new bank card?

534
00:37:28,402 --> 00:37:29,622
Goodbye.

535
00:37:29,935 --> 00:37:31,155
I'm just joking.

536
00:37:44,377 --> 00:37:45,597
Cheng Yao,

537
00:37:46,738 --> 00:37:48,378
what's going on between you and the boss?

538
00:37:57,784 --> 00:37:59,373
He has so many cases.

539
00:37:59,882 --> 00:38:01,481
Normally, you can simply pick a case

540
00:38:01,561 --> 00:38:03,502
and get a case worth 10 million yuan.

541
00:38:03,961 --> 00:38:06,141
Why did he give you a legal aid case?

542
00:38:08,409 --> 00:38:10,320
What are you doing? You are not doing well.

543
00:38:10,807 --> 00:38:12,517
You are too different compared to me.

544
00:38:15,422 --> 00:38:17,182
You've been at Junheng for some time, right?

545
00:38:17,307 --> 00:38:19,191
You need to understand what your boss thinks.

546
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,620
Don't you get it?

547
00:38:23,431 --> 00:38:25,071
What kind of employee does the boss like?

548
00:38:26,176 --> 00:38:28,356
An employee with high EQ like me.

549
00:38:29,433 --> 00:38:30,782
What is high EQ?

550
00:38:31,766 --> 00:38:34,785
One, reading the unlimited hidden meaning

551
00:38:34,882 --> 00:38:37,082
from the boss' limited facial expression.

552
00:38:37,647 --> 00:38:38,688
Two,

553
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,646
euphemistically and implicitly

554
00:38:40,727 --> 00:38:42,158
state your request.

555
00:38:42,521 --> 00:38:43,521
In the future,

556
00:38:43,641 --> 00:38:45,202
you should observe more

557
00:38:45,641 --> 00:38:47,442
when I interact with the boss.

558
00:38:49,242 --> 00:38:50,462
Learn from me.

559
00:38:54,793 --> 00:38:56,042
Let me give you an example.

560
00:39:00,168 --> 00:39:01,388
Boss.

561
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,910
I'm here to thank you.

562
00:39:04,728 --> 00:39:07,237
You organized a team-building event for my sake.

563
00:39:10,857 --> 00:39:13,077
I know it troubles you

564
00:39:13,487 --> 00:39:15,237
but I'm very touched.

565
00:39:16,268 --> 00:39:18,099
Isn't this place too expensive?

566
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:21,702
I want to cut some costs for the firm.

567
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,882
- Do you think... - Yes.

568
00:39:25,175 --> 00:39:27,006
Work overtime in the office, then.

569
00:39:27,283 --> 00:39:28,602
- You don't need to go. - No.

570
00:39:28,791 --> 00:39:29,842
No. I don't mean that.

571
00:39:29,953 --> 00:39:31,922
Should we change to another place? I mean...

572
00:39:50,453 --> 00:39:51,673
Yao Yao.

573
00:39:51,942 --> 00:39:53,855
This legal aid case is complicated.

574
00:39:54,094 --> 00:39:56,234
You must be careful when you handle it.

575
00:39:56,487 --> 00:39:58,237
You mustn't be close to the client.

576
00:39:59,921 --> 00:40:01,440
Many clients who are weak

577
00:40:01,528 --> 00:40:03,669
might not necessarily be weak.

578
00:40:06,421 --> 00:40:07,641
In this case,

579
00:40:07,983 --> 00:40:10,143
you can't be prejudiced because it's a legal aid case.

580
00:40:10,221 --> 00:40:12,242
You must clearly understand their demands first.

581
00:40:14,242 --> 00:40:15,521
Are you listening to me?

582
00:40:15,656 --> 00:40:17,047
Yes.

583
00:40:18,024 --> 00:40:20,294
Why is my boyfriend so talkative?

584
00:40:20,481 --> 00:40:22,992
Will I become deaf if we are together for a long time?

585
00:40:23,453 --> 00:40:25,032
Am I talkative?

586
00:40:25,191 --> 00:40:26,411
Aren't you?

587
00:40:27,561 --> 00:40:28,645
All right.

588
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:30,846
Didn't we agree to let me handle this case on my own?

589
00:40:30,885 --> 00:40:32,755
I haven't even met my client yet.

590
00:40:34,446 --> 00:40:36,036
Let me try it first.

591
00:40:36,242 --> 00:40:39,562
I'll ask for your help if I'm facing any problems or difficulties,

592
00:40:39,642 --> 00:40:40,802
all right?

593
00:40:41,175 --> 00:40:43,845
Sure. You should be more cautious.

594
00:40:47,161 --> 00:40:48,381
Yao Yao.

595
00:40:48,969 --> 00:40:50,189
Am I really that talkative?

596
00:40:50,842 --> 00:40:52,062
I was joking.

597
00:40:53,322 --> 00:40:54,542
Right.

598
00:40:58,065 --> 00:41:00,842
(Basic Information)

599
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:17,042
Hello, Ms. Lin.

600
00:41:17,215 --> 00:41:19,046
I am your lawyer, Chen Yao.

601
00:41:20,521 --> 00:41:22,962
I will be responsible for your case from now on.

602
00:41:23,161 --> 00:41:26,242
I will do my best to get as much alimony as I can.

603
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:38,261
Sit down.

604
00:41:43,906 --> 00:41:46,495
It's very normal to dirty your shirt while taking care of your child.

605
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:47,922
We can understand that.

606
00:41:50,762 --> 00:41:53,762
I ordered a cup of hot milk because you are breastfeeding.

607
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:55,110
Drink it.

608
00:41:56,643 --> 00:41:57,863
Thank you.

609
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:08,590
I've studied your case.

610
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,081
I'm your lawyer for an alimony dispute case,

611
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:13,490
right?

612
00:42:16,606 --> 00:42:18,663
I still need you to provide me with some original documents.

613
00:42:18,687 --> 00:42:21,711
For example, your divorce certificate with your ex-husband.

614
00:42:23,376 --> 00:42:26,156
I'm not asking for alimony from my ex-husband.

615
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:29,470
Then, who are you suing?

616
00:42:35,222 --> 00:42:36,973
The child's biological father

617
00:42:38,376 --> 00:42:39,646
is not my ex-husband.

618
00:43:09,792 --> 00:43:11,012
(Have you come back?)

619
00:43:11,183 --> 00:43:13,109
(Let's have lunch near the firm.)

620
00:43:19,282 --> 00:43:20,494
(I'm still busy.)

621
00:43:20,575 --> 00:43:21,795
(Eat without me.)
