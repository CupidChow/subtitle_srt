1
00:01:35,602 --> 00:01:38,882
(My Boss)

2
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,116
(Episode 33)

3
00:01:41,197 --> 00:01:42,197
(Qian Heng,)

4
00:01:42,762 --> 00:01:45,082
(do you also think that I cannot surpass you)

5
00:01:45,345 --> 00:01:47,032
(with my talent?)

6
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:55,170
I remember that plenty of girls were courting Qian Heng back then.

7
00:01:55,474 --> 00:01:58,553
You were the only one who could discuss cases with him.

8
00:01:58,967 --> 00:02:00,959
Back then, you told us that you would

9
00:02:01,042 --> 00:02:04,426
be the best female lawyer in the world after you graduate.

10
00:02:04,507 --> 00:02:05,801
- Enough.   - After that, you would...

11
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:08,681
What's the point of

12
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:10,256
mentioning the past now?

13
00:02:10,362 --> 00:02:11,450
Of course there's a point.

14
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,910
It reminds me of what you were like in the past.

15
00:02:21,122 --> 00:02:23,042
Sometimes, a good relationship

16
00:02:23,481 --> 00:02:24,801
can help one to grow.

17
00:02:25,374 --> 00:02:27,395
But sometimes, a terrible relationship

18
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:29,878
can stop one in their tracks.

19
00:02:31,921 --> 00:02:32,921
Yi Ran,

20
00:02:33,842 --> 00:02:35,121
you're still young.

21
00:02:35,721 --> 00:02:37,521
You still have a long way ahead of you.

22
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:40,602
Why must you dwell on a bad relationship

23
00:02:40,682 --> 00:02:42,322
that'll lead you astray?

24
00:02:46,881 --> 00:02:49,981
I still hope that you can apologize to Cheng Yao and clear her name.

25
00:02:50,641 --> 00:02:53,241
I'll tell Qian Heng not to pursue the matter.

26
00:02:53,321 --> 00:02:55,241
Regarding the negative influence it'll bring to your image,

27
00:02:55,402 --> 00:02:57,704
I'll try my best to reduce it to the lowest too.

28
00:03:03,873 --> 00:03:04,972
Initially, I thought

29
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:06,841
you wouldn't let me off easily.

30
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,290
Cheng Yao is just like my little sister.

31
00:03:12,682 --> 00:03:14,042
She was framed,

32
00:03:14,563 --> 00:03:15,922
and she suffered grievances for it.

33
00:03:16,242 --> 00:03:17,342
I'm very furious about that.

34
00:03:18,601 --> 00:03:20,002
But I never forgot

35
00:03:20,744 --> 00:03:22,305
that you were my junior too.

36
00:03:23,376 --> 00:03:24,515
You're just like us.

37
00:03:24,721 --> 00:03:26,242
You have expectations for the law.

38
00:03:26,323 --> 00:03:28,163
You have lofty aspirations and dreams.

39
00:03:40,441 --> 00:03:42,322
Don't forget about your initial goal,

40
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,480
okay?

41
00:04:36,725 --> 00:04:38,082
I don't know

42
00:04:38,242 --> 00:04:40,969
if I did the right thing by letting Liang Li Ran off.

43
00:04:43,201 --> 00:04:44,721
I think you did the right thing.

44
00:04:45,464 --> 00:04:46,464
Really?

45
00:04:48,362 --> 00:04:50,641
It's easy to ruin one person.

46
00:04:51,273 --> 00:04:54,353
But it's hard to make them turn a new leaf.

47
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,519
I don't know Qian Heng well,

48
00:04:57,722 --> 00:05:00,721
but I think Qian Heng only cares about the result.

49
00:05:01,002 --> 00:05:02,282
However, when it comes to you,

50
00:05:02,362 --> 00:05:04,301
you can see other things around the result.

51
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:06,561
That's why there are certain things

52
00:05:06,672 --> 00:05:08,162
that Qian Heng cannot achieve,

53
00:05:08,362 --> 00:05:09,582
but not you.

54
00:05:10,971 --> 00:05:13,211
Are you praising me

55
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,322
for being better than Qian Heng?

56
00:05:16,602 --> 00:05:18,162
Didn't you notice this?

57
00:05:18,242 --> 00:05:20,641
Qian Heng can't survive without you.

58
00:05:22,807 --> 00:05:25,767
You're tolerating and considerate.

59
00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:28,521
Those are rare and precious traits.

60
00:05:29,608 --> 00:05:31,408
You two complement each other well.

61
00:05:32,321 --> 00:05:35,081
That's why Junheng & Co can't survive without Qian Heng.

62
00:05:35,321 --> 00:05:36,321
But you're more important.

63
00:05:36,448 --> 00:05:37,448
But of course.

64
00:05:37,595 --> 00:05:41,282
Of course I'm more important in Junheng & Co.

65
00:05:41,377 --> 00:05:43,017
With Qian's personality,

66
00:05:43,602 --> 00:05:44,961
the law firm will be done for

67
00:05:46,081 --> 00:05:47,442
without me.

68
00:05:48,321 --> 00:05:50,547
I don't know how Lawyer Qian will deal with Liang Yi Ran

69
00:05:50,627 --> 00:05:52,627
if Lawyer Wu didn't stop him.

70
00:05:53,441 --> 00:05:55,482
I don't know why Lawyer Wu spoke up for her too.

71
00:05:55,562 --> 00:05:58,429
A person like her should leave the industry for everyone's sake.

72
00:05:59,397 --> 00:06:01,598
(Yao Yao, you don't need to be upset.)

73
00:06:01,683 --> 00:06:03,962
(Right now, besides Junheng & Co,)

74
00:06:04,042 --> 00:06:06,282
(the entire law industry is also talking about it.)

75
00:06:06,362 --> 00:06:07,501
(Everyone is siding with you.)

76
00:06:08,722 --> 00:06:10,082
I know, Tan Ying.

77
00:06:10,321 --> 00:06:11,321
I'll hang up now.

78
00:06:20,549 --> 00:06:22,997
(Liang Yi Ran)

79
00:06:35,442 --> 00:06:37,122
- Thank you.   - Don't mention it.

80
00:06:38,922 --> 00:06:39,922
Please enjoy your meal.

81
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:48,981
I plan to take a break and continue my studies overseas.

82
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,421
I've applied for a law academy in the UK.

83
00:06:52,562 --> 00:06:53,961
I'll leave once the application is accepted.

84
00:06:55,401 --> 00:06:56,421
That's pretty good.

85
00:07:01,282 --> 00:07:02,762
Actually, I'm very envious of you.

86
00:07:03,401 --> 00:07:04,682
I'm even jealous of you.

87
00:07:04,761 --> 00:07:06,842
Actually, I felt your hostility toward me

88
00:07:07,211 --> 00:07:09,138
when you first joined Junheng & Co.

89
00:07:10,441 --> 00:07:12,601
After that, I encouraged myself

90
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:14,801
in hopes

91
00:07:14,881 --> 00:07:17,281
that I could be a trustworthy lawyer like you in the future.

92
00:07:20,675 --> 00:07:22,322
Seems like

93
00:07:22,524 --> 00:07:24,082
I took the wrong path from the start.

94
00:07:26,386 --> 00:07:28,654
Now, I finally understand why Qian Heng fell for you.

95
00:07:29,602 --> 00:07:30,922
You're very vigorous.

96
00:07:31,995 --> 00:07:33,554
I'm just optimistic.

97
00:07:34,723 --> 00:07:36,002
You should know

98
00:07:36,362 --> 00:07:39,458
that Qian Heng is someone who will never get married.

99
00:07:39,682 --> 00:07:41,242
Therefore, you must be prepared

100
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,007
if you want to be together with him.

101
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:49,023
Right now, I don't plan on getting married either.

102
00:07:50,807 --> 00:07:52,082
But it's hard to say.

103
00:07:52,401 --> 00:07:55,322
Maybe that was what he thought before encountering you.

104
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:57,860
After all, he did change a lot because of you.

105
00:08:27,561 --> 00:08:29,005
I still have an appointment to attend.

106
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,759
I'll make a move first if there's nothing else.

107
00:08:34,202 --> 00:08:35,202
I'm sorry.

108
00:08:51,602 --> 00:08:52,702
Safe flight.

109
00:09:29,681 --> 00:09:30,762
What's wrong?

110
00:09:34,521 --> 00:09:36,202
Yao Yao, I'm sorry.

111
00:09:36,435 --> 00:09:38,458
Yesterday, I said: "Where else could you go besides Junheng & Co?"

112
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:41,585
What I meant was that I was the shelter that you could go to.

113
00:09:42,934 --> 00:09:44,922
I thought you meant

114
00:09:45,161 --> 00:09:47,282
that no law firms would hire me after I left Junheng & Co.

115
00:09:47,434 --> 00:09:49,739
How could that be? That's not what I mean.

116
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,754
I'll never say that again.

117
00:09:51,835 --> 00:09:52,956
I'm sorry.

118
00:09:53,641 --> 00:09:55,001
I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.

119
00:09:55,106 --> 00:09:56,106
I'm sorry.

120
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,128
Can you stop being angry at me?

121
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,141
I'm sorry.

122
00:10:05,202 --> 00:10:06,202
Does it hurt?

123
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,160
Don't be angry, okay?

124
00:10:09,362 --> 00:10:10,602
I'm no longer angry.

125
00:10:10,881 --> 00:10:12,642
The durian punished you on my behalf.

126
00:10:13,761 --> 00:10:15,122
I'm glad that you're not angry anymore.

127
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,842
Come.

128
00:10:21,561 --> 00:10:22,922
Are you okay?

129
00:10:23,411 --> 00:10:24,890
I'm fine.

130
00:10:27,562 --> 00:10:29,961
I was being inconsiderate

131
00:10:30,486 --> 00:10:31,802
when I transferred you to Liang Yi Ran's team.

132
00:10:31,903 --> 00:10:33,282
You suffered a lot of grievances because of that.

133
00:10:33,322 --> 00:10:34,322
I'm sorry.

134
00:10:35,348 --> 00:10:36,642
Stop apologizing to me.

135
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:38,984
I wanted to join her team myself. It's not your fault.

136
00:10:39,131 --> 00:10:42,731
But why did you meet up with Li Cheng Xuan in secret?

137
00:10:43,641 --> 00:10:46,642
And, I heard that he had a flash marriage before this.

138
00:10:47,002 --> 00:10:48,522
Now, he's married.

139
00:10:49,842 --> 00:10:51,704
Not only is he uglier and poorer than me,

140
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:53,224
but he also has a lower percentage of winning cases.

141
00:10:54,401 --> 00:10:56,922
I met him because of the job interview for Jincheng & Co.

142
00:10:57,113 --> 00:10:58,682
I received the recruitment notice today.

143
00:10:58,962 --> 00:11:00,562
Why did you choose Jincheng & Co?

144
00:11:00,753 --> 00:11:03,713
Jincheng & Co always lagged behind us and took on the cases we rejected.

145
00:11:03,847 --> 00:11:05,167
The benefit there is worse than ours.

146
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:11,362
I wish to explore the outside world.

147
00:11:11,521 --> 00:11:13,482
I wish to establish a foothold in the industry.

148
00:11:13,767 --> 00:11:16,728
I want to be an outstanding lawyer like you through my effort.

149
00:11:17,202 --> 00:11:18,202
But...

150
00:11:19,401 --> 00:11:20,501
But

151
00:11:20,905 --> 00:11:22,865
the coffee machine there sucks.

152
00:11:25,482 --> 00:11:26,722
Enough.

153
00:11:26,881 --> 00:11:29,762
Just don't worry and let me get used to a new environment,

154
00:11:29,881 --> 00:11:30,881
okay?

155
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,483
Okay, then.

156
00:11:35,463 --> 00:11:37,764
Don't be angry. I'll peel the durian for you.

157
00:11:40,442 --> 00:11:41,462
Wait for me.

158
00:12:56,002 --> 00:12:57,562
I'm going to be late for work.

159
00:13:13,921 --> 00:13:16,042
We have to investigate the situation

160
00:13:16,122 --> 00:13:17,802
before and after their marriage.

161
00:13:19,002 --> 00:13:21,021
We can't just believe in whatever he says, right?

162
00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:24,050
- Boss.   - Lawyer Qian.

163
00:13:25,602 --> 00:13:26,602
Boss...

164
00:13:33,401 --> 00:13:35,162
Was it because of his attire?

165
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:38,402
Why do I feel like his back looks especially dreary today?

166
00:13:38,761 --> 00:13:40,882
He gave off a sense of desolation.

167
00:13:40,962 --> 00:13:42,322
You think you're cultured, huh?

168
00:13:43,401 --> 00:13:44,793
With our boss's personality,

169
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:48,470
I think it's likely that we'll purchase Jincheng & Co soon.

170
00:13:48,617 --> 00:13:50,937
Law firms cannot be purchased. They can only be merged.

171
00:13:51,273 --> 00:13:52,802
What? Are you the only law expert here?

172
00:13:53,401 --> 00:13:54,565
Is that even the point?

173
00:13:54,646 --> 00:13:57,726
The point is, Cheng Yao has joined Jincheng & Co.

174
00:13:59,161 --> 00:14:04,043
Say, which of you two will be scolded by our boss today?

175
00:14:07,122 --> 00:14:09,121
Can we do it in turns?

176
00:14:10,761 --> 00:14:11,901
That won't happen.

177
00:14:12,002 --> 00:14:15,241
I think he has to pick up Cheng Yao after work.

178
00:14:15,681 --> 00:14:17,802
If so, you should thank Cheng Yao.

179
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:19,100
I don't think I'll be scolded.

180
00:14:20,184 --> 00:14:21,465
Everyone, put aside your work.

181
00:14:21,602 --> 00:14:23,642
Let me introduce someone new. From today onward,

182
00:14:23,722 --> 00:14:26,441
Cheng Yao will be one of us.

183
00:14:26,536 --> 00:14:27,597
Let's welcome her.

184
00:14:30,962 --> 00:14:31,981
Proceed with your work.

185
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:38,621
Yao Yao, I never expected you to join us right after I joined them.

186
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:39,921
Welcome.

187
00:14:41,585 --> 00:14:42,882
Thank you, Senior.

188
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:45,050
Boss, thank you. I'll do my best.

189
00:14:45,163 --> 00:14:47,284
Don't mention it. Let's have lunch together later.

190
00:14:47,365 --> 00:14:48,962
We'll celebrate Cheng Yao's recruitment.

191
00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:50,049
Sure.

192
00:14:52,161 --> 00:14:56,481
Cheng Yao, I heard that your ex-boss, Qian Heng, was quite toxic.

193
00:14:56,914 --> 00:14:58,242
I heard that before too.

194
00:14:58,426 --> 00:15:00,242
His toxic behavior was well-known within the industry.

195
00:15:00,555 --> 00:15:03,794
All the female employees he employed left before three months were up.

196
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,347
Cheng Yao, did you resign because of that?

197
00:15:06,428 --> 00:15:08,667
- Yeah. Tell us about it.   - Of course not.

198
00:15:09,359 --> 00:15:12,840
That was a joke cracked by employees who couldn't adhere to his rules.

199
00:15:13,058 --> 00:15:15,362
As for his toxic behavior, it depends on the individual.

200
00:15:15,678 --> 00:15:16,680
I'm doing well, aren't I?

201
00:15:16,761 --> 00:15:18,522
If so, is he hard to get along with?

202
00:15:18,602 --> 00:15:20,522
Is he difficult to serve?

203
00:15:21,082 --> 00:15:22,302
He's not that bad.

204
00:15:23,628 --> 00:15:26,628
Lawyer Qian differentiates between public and private matters clearly.

205
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:29,290
Sometimes, he might seem inhumane.

206
00:15:29,442 --> 00:15:32,081
But I learned a lot from working under him.

207
00:15:32,202 --> 00:15:33,762
To me, it's very helpful.

208
00:15:33,842 --> 00:15:35,042
I'm very thankful to him.

209
00:15:35,202 --> 00:15:37,242
I should thank Qian Heng

210
00:15:37,346 --> 00:15:39,705
for nurturing an excellent lawyer like Cheng Yao.

211
00:15:40,011 --> 00:15:41,601
With you and Gu Bei Qing,

212
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:43,871
there's a chance for Jincheng & Co to make a comeback.

213
00:15:43,952 --> 00:15:45,032
Come, cheers.

214
00:15:45,113 --> 00:15:46,442
- Cheers.   - Cheers.

215
00:15:46,522 --> 00:15:48,202
- Jincheng & Co, we can do it.   - Cheers.

216
00:15:51,882 --> 00:15:53,482
You two

217
00:15:53,561 --> 00:15:55,162
are such a good pair.

218
00:15:55,761 --> 00:15:56,855
The overall beauty level of Jincheng & Co

219
00:15:56,936 --> 00:15:59,482
rose to a new level after you two joined us.

220
00:15:59,623 --> 00:16:01,063
More importantly,

221
00:16:01,338 --> 00:16:03,204
you two joined Jincheng & Co

222
00:16:03,285 --> 00:16:05,362
at almost the same time.

223
00:16:05,442 --> 00:16:06,961
This must be fate.

224
00:16:07,482 --> 00:16:08,482
Yeah.

225
00:16:10,641 --> 00:16:11,641
Cheng Yao.

226
00:16:17,842 --> 00:16:19,081
Lawyer Qian?

227
00:16:20,641 --> 00:16:21,822
What are you doing here?

228
00:16:23,322 --> 00:16:25,222
I have several cases to discuss with you.

229
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,442
I've already resigned from Junheng & Co.

230
00:16:28,584 --> 00:16:30,664
I've finished my handover work too.

231
00:16:30,881 --> 00:16:33,522
Qian Heng, you see,

232
00:16:33,602 --> 00:16:36,870
although Lawyer Cheng already resigned, we're still in the same industry.

233
00:16:36,951 --> 00:16:39,230
we should help each other out.

234
00:16:39,726 --> 00:16:42,607
Since you're here, why don't you join us for lunch?

235
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:44,242
No need for that.

236
00:16:44,401 --> 00:16:45,642
Excuse me.

237
00:16:45,988 --> 00:16:47,908
Thank you. I don't like this seat.

238
00:17:00,642 --> 00:17:02,802
I remember you suffered three losses in a row

239
00:17:02,913 --> 00:17:04,812
before joining Jincheng & Co, right?

240
00:17:05,434 --> 00:17:07,753
You engaged two of my subordinates in court.

241
00:17:07,922 --> 00:17:10,182
I would've told them to go easy on you

242
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,442
had I known that you would be colleagues with Cheng Yao in the future.

243
00:17:12,561 --> 00:17:14,322
At least they won't embarrass you entirely.

244
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,922
I was unlucky before this. I kept encountering lawyers from Junheng & Co.

245
00:17:21,698 --> 00:17:23,177
Now that I've joined Jincheng & Co,

246
00:17:23,281 --> 00:17:25,562
- it's a change of environment for me.   - That's right.

247
00:17:25,682 --> 00:17:27,962
I think you're making things too simple here.

248
00:17:28,242 --> 00:17:30,601
You'll have plenty of chances to encounter my subordinates in the future.

249
00:17:31,863 --> 00:17:34,264
It's lunchtime. Let's not talk about work.

250
00:17:34,895 --> 00:17:36,456
It's rare for us to gather here. Let's eat.

251
00:17:38,472 --> 00:17:42,202
Cheng Yao, I'll offer you twice the benefit Li Cheng Xuan offered to you.

252
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:45,362
What about this? I'll give you 20 days of paid leave per year.

253
00:17:45,442 --> 00:17:46,882
I'll agree to all of your conditions.

254
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,041
Come back to our law firm.

255
00:17:48,626 --> 00:17:49,626
Qian Heng,

256
00:17:49,794 --> 00:17:51,434
I just signed her, you know?

257
00:17:51,514 --> 00:17:53,962
What do you mean by this? Are you headhunting her in front of me?

258
00:17:54,087 --> 00:17:55,728
What do you mean by headhunting?

259
00:17:56,214 --> 00:17:57,434
She was mine before this.

260
00:17:59,002 --> 00:18:00,801
Junheng & Co is not a slave trading company.

261
00:18:00,882 --> 00:18:02,322
It's just a job.

262
00:18:02,402 --> 00:18:04,241
- It's not like she sold herself to you.   - That's right.

263
00:18:04,321 --> 00:18:06,402
And, everyone has their own career planning.

264
00:18:06,482 --> 00:18:08,322
Since Cheng Yao joined Jincheng & Co,

265
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,595
that means her previous position didn't suit her.

266
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:12,362
There's no need for you to put her on the spot.

267
00:18:12,443 --> 00:18:13,859
Cheng Yao is my girlfriend.

268
00:18:19,178 --> 00:18:21,779
- Did I say he was toxic just now?   - Yeah.

269
00:18:34,841 --> 00:18:38,241
Didn't we agree last night that you wouldn't interfere with my new job?

270
00:18:38,402 --> 00:18:39,681
I just joined the firm, you know?

271
00:18:39,762 --> 00:18:41,162
And, you revealed our relationship to them.

272
00:18:41,332 --> 00:18:43,122
I'm jealous. I'm upset.

273
00:18:43,202 --> 00:18:44,562
Why are you jealous?

274
00:18:45,162 --> 00:18:46,362
Li Cheng Xuan posted on his Moments.

275
00:18:46,443 --> 00:18:48,242
I saw Gu Bei Qing giving you a bouquet of Baby's Breath.

276
00:18:48,424 --> 00:18:49,485
What's wrong with that?

277
00:18:49,566 --> 00:18:51,162
Do you know what Baby's Breath means?

278
00:18:51,242 --> 00:18:53,133
It means pure love. You give them to the person you wish to confess to.

279
00:18:53,214 --> 00:18:55,735
Please. He's a dense man. How would he know such a thing?

280
00:18:55,816 --> 00:18:58,162
Baby's Breath is the most common flower you can find in a florist.

281
00:18:58,273 --> 00:18:59,592
He bought it on a whim.

282
00:19:00,081 --> 00:19:01,882
You shouldn't let your imagination run wild.

283
00:19:01,962 --> 00:19:03,322
Aren't you busy enough with the cases in Junheng & Co?

284
00:19:03,402 --> 00:19:04,441
Even so...

285
00:19:04,521 --> 00:19:06,602
Even so, he can't just buy you flowers like that.

286
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:12,541
When you weren't around, I spent most of my time thinking about you.

287
00:19:12,922 --> 00:19:13,922
However,

288
00:19:14,121 --> 00:19:15,602
even so,

289
00:19:15,682 --> 00:19:17,781
I'm still much more efficient than other people.

290
00:19:20,402 --> 00:19:21,581
All right now.

291
00:19:22,121 --> 00:19:24,417
Gu Bei Qing and I are just normal colleagues.

292
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:25,978
We're just alumni from the same college.

293
00:19:26,962 --> 00:19:28,602
Don't let your imagination run wild, okay?

294
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:37,242
I'll try my best to have lunch with you next time, okay?

295
00:19:37,347 --> 00:19:39,267
No. You must have lunch with me every day.

296
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:40,565
Every day?

297
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,516
All right, then. I'll try my best

298
00:19:44,597 --> 00:19:46,201
to have lunch with you every day.

299
00:19:46,281 --> 00:19:48,282
You cannot work overtime too. You have to keep me company at home.

300
00:19:48,443 --> 00:19:50,002
You don't want me to pass my probation?

301
00:19:50,761 --> 00:19:53,981
If so, I won't work overtime. I'll wait for you at home.

302
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:43,682
Guys, let me explain myself.

303
00:20:44,215 --> 00:20:46,602
I'm indeed Qian Heng's girlfriend.

304
00:20:46,686 --> 00:20:47,973
But that doesn't affect my work.

305
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,882
I hope you guys can treat me normally

306
00:20:49,962 --> 00:20:52,322
like how you would treat a normal colleague.

307
00:20:52,425 --> 00:20:54,165
I'll do my best to cooperate with you guys.

308
00:20:56,801 --> 00:20:59,001
Cheng Yao, sorry about that.

309
00:20:59,081 --> 00:21:01,882
I didn't mean to insult Lawyer Qian this afternoon.

310
00:21:01,979 --> 00:21:03,882
I didn't know about your relationship with him.

311
00:21:04,566 --> 00:21:05,613
Me too.

312
00:21:05,694 --> 00:21:09,642
I just heard rumors about him and I wanted to see if they were true.

313
00:21:09,947 --> 00:21:12,587
But I didn't mean to slander him.

314
00:21:12,668 --> 00:21:13,681
It's fine.

315
00:21:13,761 --> 00:21:16,761
I wanted to insult him much more than you guys when I joined Junheng & Co.

316
00:21:16,978 --> 00:21:17,978
It's fine.

317
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,481
If so, how did you guys fall in love?

318
00:21:20,584 --> 00:21:22,562
- Who courted whom?   - Yeah.

319
00:21:22,857 --> 00:21:24,138
Why don't we talk about that after work?

320
00:21:25,621 --> 00:21:27,362
Sorry about that.

321
00:21:27,442 --> 00:21:29,001
I was just very curious.

322
00:21:29,081 --> 00:21:31,082
It feels surreal

323
00:21:31,162 --> 00:21:33,481
to see my colleague dating

324
00:21:33,561 --> 00:21:35,711
a renowned figure in the industry.

325
00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:38,712
I suppose this is what they mean by dreams becoming reality.

326
00:21:40,162 --> 00:21:43,682
Jincheng & Co often takes on cases rejected by Junheng & Co.

327
00:21:43,962 --> 00:21:46,721
Lawyer Li even calls himself the rejection case handler.

328
00:21:47,841 --> 00:21:49,001
What a shame.

329
00:21:49,081 --> 00:21:51,402
I was looking forward to engaging Junheng & Co in court.

330
00:22:02,608 --> 00:22:04,008
Senior, what's the matter?

331
00:22:07,033 --> 00:22:08,095
Senior,

332
00:22:09,315 --> 00:22:10,315
what's wrong?

333
00:22:16,895 --> 00:22:18,615
Did I not tell you

334
00:22:19,162 --> 00:22:20,642
why I joined this firm?

335
00:22:20,761 --> 00:22:22,642
I thought you wanted to have a change of environment.

336
00:22:23,465 --> 00:22:24,905
Actually, it was

337
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,137
because of Qian Heng.

338
00:22:31,482 --> 00:22:33,442
You had no idea how unlucky I was

339
00:22:33,601 --> 00:22:35,642
after encountering him.

340
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:37,922
Some time ago, the case of Xu Jun and Bai Xing Meng

341
00:22:38,002 --> 00:22:40,222
occurred during the crucial moment before I could become a partner.

342
00:22:40,878 --> 00:22:42,358
Once I win the lawsuit,

343
00:22:42,521 --> 00:22:44,001
I'll definitely get promoted.

344
00:22:44,127 --> 00:22:45,807
You knew what happened in the end.

345
00:22:46,121 --> 00:22:47,222
But I didn't give up.

346
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,631
I pulled myself together

347
00:22:49,712 --> 00:22:51,351
and took on three cases at the same time.

348
00:22:52,561 --> 00:22:53,801
I lost all of them.

349
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:57,428
That was what Qian Heng meant by my three losses in a row.

350
00:22:58,642 --> 00:23:00,204
That's why I left and joined this firm.

351
00:23:00,402 --> 00:23:03,401
I did so to escape from Qian Heng and his curse.

352
00:23:03,529 --> 00:23:05,568
Senior, don't be flustered.

353
00:23:05,655 --> 00:23:07,575
I think those were just coincidences.

354
00:23:08,793 --> 00:23:10,713
- What's wrong?   - When I see your face,

355
00:23:10,801 --> 00:23:12,562
I see the words "Qian Heng"

356
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:14,041
glowing

357
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,682
on your face.

358
00:23:17,682 --> 00:23:19,442
I thought I wouldn't need to see him again

359
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,202
after leaving my previous law firm.

360
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:23,124
But it turns out that the person he cares the most about

361
00:23:23,623 --> 00:23:25,823
is sitting right beside me.

362
00:23:42,091 --> 00:23:43,602
Why isn't she back yet?

363
00:23:45,025 --> 00:23:46,282
I'm back.

364
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:48,028
What are you doing?

365
00:23:48,321 --> 00:23:49,321
I'm working.

366
00:23:50,686 --> 00:23:51,687
I suppose

367
00:23:51,814 --> 00:23:53,494
you couldn't get used to Jincheng & Co yet.

368
00:23:55,186 --> 00:23:58,025
Not at all. Senior was there too. The firm felt endearing.

369
00:23:59,281 --> 00:24:01,802
I'm sure Li Cheng Xuan doesn't treasure you as much as I do.

370
00:24:01,882 --> 00:24:02,974
Lawyer Li?

371
00:24:03,922 --> 00:24:07,201
He wanted Senior and I to form a team that deals with high-end cases.

372
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:08,602
We have already taken on several cases.

373
00:24:09,761 --> 00:24:12,402
Junheng & Co requires at least three people to form a team.

374
00:24:12,521 --> 00:24:14,481
Li Cheng Xuan formed a team with you two in it?

375
00:24:14,561 --> 00:24:16,042
I suppose that's why his law firm cannot grow.

376
00:24:16,513 --> 00:24:20,193
That proves that Senior and I are capable.

377
00:24:20,521 --> 00:24:22,201
And, I think a duo is great.

378
00:24:22,281 --> 00:24:24,082
Although I'm in a new environment,

379
00:24:24,202 --> 00:24:25,651
I don't need to fight alone.

380
00:24:25,732 --> 00:24:27,281
And, I don't need to worry about interpersonal conflicts.

381
00:24:27,361 --> 00:24:28,721
A duo like us is perfect.

382
00:24:32,306 --> 00:24:34,802
Is our neighbor cooking something?

383
00:24:35,402 --> 00:24:36,939
Why do I smell jealousy in the living room?

384
00:24:44,882 --> 00:24:46,602
What's so good about Gu Bei Qing?

385
00:24:49,745 --> 00:24:51,002
Don't you feel the same?

386
00:25:00,642 --> 00:25:03,061
You must bless me.

387
00:25:03,442 --> 00:25:04,622
Don't let me encounter Qian Heng.

388
00:25:08,457 --> 00:25:10,977
Ordinary people only require two seconds to get through this door.

389
00:25:11,058 --> 00:25:13,819
You took one minute. That's 30 times longer than usual.

390
00:25:15,121 --> 00:25:16,322
Gu Bei Qing,

391
00:25:16,962 --> 00:25:19,322
I can sue you for occupying public resources.

392
00:25:20,958 --> 00:25:22,997
If superstition could resolve one's issues,

393
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:24,642
the existence of lawyers would be meaningless.

394
00:25:24,761 --> 00:25:27,002
Gu Bei Qing, can you please take note of your status as a lawyer?

395
00:25:27,603 --> 00:25:29,202
According to Article 36 of Constitution of the People's Republic of China,

396
00:25:29,283 --> 00:25:30,804
citizens shall enjoy freedom of religious belief.

397
00:25:30,885 --> 00:25:32,285
Senior is a lawyer

398
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:33,642
and a citizen of the country.

399
00:25:33,828 --> 00:25:34,828
Am I right?

400
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:41,318
I bought this from a new shop.

401
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:42,399
Senior, here.

402
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,682
- I'm not thirsty.   - Yao Yao.

403
00:25:45,973 --> 00:25:47,642
You could tell me directly if you bought a drink for me.

404
00:25:47,722 --> 00:25:49,082
There's no need to pretend to be nice in front of your colleague.

405
00:25:49,162 --> 00:25:50,521
You'll only be embarrassing him.

406
00:25:51,041 --> 00:25:52,281
I bought it for Senior.

407
00:25:52,361 --> 00:25:54,041
You've been stressed out lately, right?

408
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,138
- Is that so?   - Gu Bei Qing,

409
00:25:59,325 --> 00:26:00,842
being a lawyer is a stressful occupation.

410
00:26:00,942 --> 00:26:02,922
If you can't take the pressure, you should change your occupation.

411
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,202
Senior, just ignore him.

412
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,882
- Let's go to work.   - Why is he doing this?

413
00:26:09,841 --> 00:26:12,842
When can I get rid of this curse?

414
00:26:23,274 --> 00:26:24,714
This coffee is pretty good.

415
00:26:24,841 --> 00:26:25,982
I want to invest in this shop.

416
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,454
Even if you invest in this building,

417
00:26:28,534 --> 00:26:30,001
you still have to take the same elevators as us.

418
00:27:09,497 --> 00:27:11,418
Bao Rui, come here.

419
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:15,402
I guess I struck the lottery.

420
00:27:33,002 --> 00:27:36,106
(Don't make things difficult for my colleagues during working hours.)

421
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:38,547
(I'll be yours after work.)

422
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:40,682
(I bought the coffee this morning for you.)

423
00:27:40,753 --> 00:27:42,473
(I knew it was your favorite coffee.)

424
00:27:55,939 --> 00:27:56,939
Boss.

425
00:27:59,601 --> 00:28:00,601
Were you looking for me?

426
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:07,670
I did take the toilet roll in the restroom yesterday.

427
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:11,642
But I didn't take the coffee in the pantry.

428
00:28:11,801 --> 00:28:13,802
I only took some creamers.

429
00:28:13,922 --> 00:28:14,922
Great timing.

430
00:28:15,002 --> 00:28:17,473
I was thinking that the coffee they sold downstairs was pretty good.

431
00:28:17,554 --> 00:28:18,626
Buy some for everyone here.

432
00:28:18,707 --> 00:28:20,003
You could put those creamers to good use.

433
00:28:20,106 --> 00:28:21,106
Go now.

434
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:23,202
Just go.

435
00:28:49,023 --> 00:28:51,922
Senior, Qian Heng isn't that scary.

436
00:28:52,081 --> 00:28:54,002
We can defeat him eventually.

437
00:29:19,626 --> 00:29:22,082
Lawyer Cheng, I wish to withdraw the lawsuit.

438
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:24,942
There's no longer any need to acquire evidence of his affair.

439
00:29:26,114 --> 00:29:28,262
No problem. However, once you breach the contract,

440
00:29:28,343 --> 00:29:30,962
according to the rules, our law firm won't accept your requests again.

441
00:29:31,176 --> 00:29:34,103
Lawyer Cheng, the consultation only took half an hour. Do I have to pay?

442
00:29:34,184 --> 00:29:36,441
Of course. A lawyer's time is money.

443
00:29:36,536 --> 00:29:38,217
Time is equally precious to everyone.

444
00:29:42,988 --> 00:29:44,948
The evaluation form is out. Take a look.

445
00:29:52,841 --> 00:29:55,201
Lin Lan, contact the HR Department

446
00:29:55,281 --> 00:29:57,402
and ask for the photos of Lawyer Cheng and Lawyer Gu.

447
00:29:57,482 --> 00:30:00,021
Make some arrangements for our website, official page, and an interview.

448
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:02,722
We'll use this golden duo to increase the law firm's popularity.

449
00:30:02,803 --> 00:30:04,962
Oh yeah. Tell everyone that we're holding a lunch gathering today.

450
00:30:05,057 --> 00:30:07,098
- We have to celebrate this occasion.   - Okay.

451
00:30:07,179 --> 00:30:08,538
Let's keep in touch.

452
00:30:08,642 --> 00:30:09,770
All right. Thank you.

453
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:11,091
- Over here, please.   - Please.

454
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:13,922
(Qian Heng)

455
00:30:20,722 --> 00:30:22,602
(Lawyer Qian, I received news)

456
00:30:22,682 --> 00:30:24,721
(that Jincheng & Co will be holding a lunch gathering downstairs.)

457
00:30:24,809 --> 00:30:27,090
(They're trying to ship Cheng Yao and Gu Bu Qing together.)

458
00:30:27,531 --> 00:30:30,171
(Since you helped Cheng Yao to deal with Liang Yi Ran before this,)

459
00:30:30,252 --> 00:30:32,281
(this intel is free of charge.)

460
00:30:32,521 --> 00:30:34,121
(As for what to do with it,)

461
00:30:34,202 --> 00:30:35,422
(you can proceed with that yourself.)

462
00:30:37,768 --> 00:30:40,169
(What's the meaning of ship?)

463
00:30:57,642 --> 00:30:58,722
Strange.

464
00:30:58,882 --> 00:31:00,322
It's the afternoon of a weekday.

465
00:31:00,815 --> 00:31:02,255
Even so, we couldn't book a room.

466
00:31:02,722 --> 00:31:04,162
It's livelier when we sit near each other.

467
00:31:04,922 --> 00:31:05,922
It's fine.

468
00:31:06,002 --> 00:31:07,642
Come.

469
00:31:07,791 --> 00:31:09,441
Let's raise our glasses and celebrate the occasion.

470
00:31:09,521 --> 00:31:12,521
Cheng Yao and Gu Bu Qing broke Jincheng & Co's monthly record

471
00:31:12,601 --> 00:31:15,122
on the first month they joined us.

472
00:31:15,202 --> 00:31:16,761
Let's bask in their joy.

473
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:18,362
- Come, cheers.   - Cheers.

474
00:31:18,442 --> 00:31:20,402
- Let's celebrate the occasion.   - Thank you.

475
00:31:35,097 --> 00:31:38,818
I've already booked the magazine cover for the next lawyer's weekly volume.

476
00:31:39,402 --> 00:31:42,801
Cheng Yao and Gu Bu Qing, spare some time for next week's photoshoot.

477
00:31:58,162 --> 00:31:59,362
Boss, it's fine.

478
00:31:59,601 --> 00:32:01,281
I have friends working in the magazine firm.

479
00:32:01,361 --> 00:32:02,762
The two of us will do a photoshoot next week.

480
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:04,282
They won't be able to do the photoshoot.

481
00:32:04,482 --> 00:32:05,922
We'll be on the magazine cover instead.

482
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:07,041
Have you lost your mind?

483
00:32:08,482 --> 00:32:10,679
Thank you, boss. But the photoshoot is unnecessary.

484
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,571
Now, I just want to take on more cases

485
00:32:13,652 --> 00:32:15,159
and accumulate more experience.

486
00:32:15,922 --> 00:32:17,642
Precisely. We're lawyers, not celebrities.

487
00:32:17,722 --> 00:32:19,562
We don't need to ship them together and form such an image.

488
00:32:19,642 --> 00:32:21,882
And, what if it blows up?

489
00:32:22,002 --> 00:32:24,481
Cheng Yao will get married to Lawyer Qian in the future.

490
00:32:24,561 --> 00:32:25,961
What if he misunderstands us?

491
00:32:28,841 --> 00:32:30,083
That's right.

492
00:32:30,177 --> 00:32:34,202
Lawyer Li, you can't bear the consequences for ruining their marriage.

493
00:32:35,242 --> 00:32:37,481
I was only thinking about promoting the law firm.

494
00:32:37,561 --> 00:32:39,882
I actually forgot all about Qian Heng.

495
00:32:40,202 --> 00:32:41,282
Cheng Yao, don't worry.

496
00:32:41,363 --> 00:32:45,241
Our law firm doesn't mind the status of our female employees.

497
00:32:45,443 --> 00:32:47,962
Just tell me in advance before you get married.

498
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:50,402
I'll give you a huge red packet.

499
00:32:50,482 --> 00:32:52,882
Right now, my goal is to increase our sales.

500
00:32:52,962 --> 00:32:54,242
I'm in no hurry to get married.

501
00:32:54,954 --> 00:32:57,042
- Look at how sensible she is.   - Let's drink.

502
00:32:59,302 --> 00:33:01,682
(So, we have the same plans in life.)

503
00:33:01,801 --> 00:33:04,495
(I knew I was right about her.)

504
00:33:04,741 --> 00:33:05,802
- Here.   - Senior, let me refill your glass.

505
00:33:05,882 --> 00:33:07,201
- Thank you.   - This liquor is nice, right?

506
00:33:07,281 --> 00:33:08,281
Yeah.

507
00:33:08,561 --> 00:33:09,682
Not bad at all.

508
00:33:09,761 --> 00:33:10,902
Congratulations.

509
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,302
Boss, let me pour you some tea

510
00:33:19,383 --> 00:33:20,677
and relieve some of your heatiness.

511
00:33:21,617 --> 00:33:22,762
I'm fine.

512
00:33:23,185 --> 00:33:25,165
You guys can go ahead. Lunch is on me.

513
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,643
Bao Rui, when you go back,

514
00:33:27,832 --> 00:33:29,047
buy some milk tea for everyone in the office.

515
00:33:29,128 --> 00:33:30,149
It's my treat.

516
00:33:47,361 --> 00:33:48,931
I feel like I don't understand him anymore.

517
00:33:49,841 --> 00:33:51,741
I can no longer read his mind.

518
00:33:53,587 --> 00:33:55,867
Hurry and eat. I'm starving.

519
00:33:56,682 --> 00:33:57,922
I don't have an appetite.

520
00:33:59,801 --> 00:34:01,402
Forget it. No one can live without food.

521
00:34:01,482 --> 00:34:03,402
This is pretty nice.

522
00:34:03,482 --> 00:34:04,761
But it's cold now.

523
00:34:12,041 --> 00:34:13,921
Hello. Welcome to Jincheng & Co.

524
00:34:14,241 --> 00:34:15,241
Hello.

525
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:18,142
Please ask your boss to see me.

526
00:34:18,442 --> 00:34:20,441
Why are you looking for him?

527
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,362
I intend to purchase your firm.

528
00:34:22,496 --> 00:34:24,136
I want to discuss the price with him.

529
00:34:24,241 --> 00:34:25,402
Let's talk this over.

530
00:34:25,778 --> 00:34:27,135
I will never allow anyone

531
00:34:27,216 --> 00:34:30,881
to disturb the relationship between my son and my future daughter-in-law.

532
00:34:31,258 --> 00:34:33,357
- Call him.   - Mrs. Qian? Why are you here?

533
00:34:33,681 --> 00:34:35,202
Yao Yao, you're here.

534
00:34:35,352 --> 00:34:36,631
Sorry for bothering your work.

535
00:34:36,732 --> 00:34:38,513
I'm serious. Call your boss.

536
00:34:38,606 --> 00:34:41,105
- Why are you here?   - Yao Yao, why did you leave the firm?

537
00:34:41,201 --> 00:34:42,432
I had no idea at all.

538
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:43,793
Did Qian Heng bully you?

539
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:46,001
- Tell me about it. I'll teach him a lesson.   - That's not it.

540
00:34:46,081 --> 00:34:47,722
- Please have a seat.   - Really?

541
00:34:47,802 --> 00:34:49,962
If so, why did you leave the firm?

542
00:34:52,161 --> 00:34:53,562
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.

543
00:34:54,721 --> 00:34:56,602
Absence makes the heart grow fonder?

544
00:34:59,482 --> 00:35:00,482
I know now.

545
00:35:01,442 --> 00:35:03,242
That's romantic.

546
00:35:03,322 --> 00:35:05,962
Youngsters like you all are so good at this.

547
00:35:07,282 --> 00:35:08,842
Yao Yao, look.

548
00:35:08,922 --> 00:35:11,002
I made this soup especially for you.

549
00:35:11,201 --> 00:35:12,481
Finish it.

550
00:35:12,561 --> 00:35:13,575
Thank you, Mrs. Qian.

551
00:35:13,656 --> 00:35:15,111
Here, let me open it for you.

552
00:35:15,219 --> 00:35:17,198
- Let me do it myself.   - It's fine.

553
00:35:18,146 --> 00:35:19,666
Here you go. It smells nice, right?

554
00:35:20,282 --> 00:35:21,441
I can smell the Chinese herbs.

555
00:35:21,521 --> 00:35:22,762
What kind of soup is this?

556
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,882
This is the special Ten Essence Herbal Soup

557
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:27,202
I made especially for a girl like you.

558
00:35:27,282 --> 00:35:29,682
When you get married to Qian Heng in the future,

559
00:35:29,762 --> 00:35:31,762
you can get pregnant quickly

560
00:35:31,865 --> 00:35:33,424
when you want after having this.

561
00:35:34,482 --> 00:35:35,881
Isn't it too early?

562
00:35:37,032 --> 00:35:38,032
Is it early?

563
00:35:39,681 --> 00:35:41,682
Yeah. Youngsters like you all

564
00:35:41,762 --> 00:35:43,922
don't want to be restrained by kids at this age.

565
00:35:43,989 --> 00:35:45,762
All right, then. You guys can enjoy yourselves

566
00:35:45,842 --> 00:35:47,322
for as long as you want after marriage.

567
00:35:47,402 --> 00:35:48,682
I'll make this soup for you

568
00:35:48,763 --> 00:35:50,163
when you want to have a child.

569
00:35:50,474 --> 00:35:53,721
- Don't worry.   - Actually, we don't intend to get married yet.

570
00:35:58,002 --> 00:35:59,062
What did you say?

571
00:36:07,393 --> 00:36:08,412
What are you doing?

572
00:36:09,161 --> 00:36:11,402
Dad, this is Cheng Yao's favorite.

573
00:36:11,554 --> 00:36:13,833
She's working overtime today. I have to keep some of it as her supper.

574
00:36:13,945 --> 00:36:16,344
Your mother loves prawns too.

575
00:36:16,688 --> 00:36:18,882
You can buy your own food if you want to please your girlfriend.

576
00:36:19,036 --> 00:36:20,322
- Wait.   - Don't steal your mother's food.

577
00:36:20,403 --> 00:36:22,362
- Wait, I...   - Your mother already went to deliver soup to her.

578
00:36:22,442 --> 00:36:24,081
- Did you know that?   - What soup?

579
00:36:25,762 --> 00:36:28,922
It's pointless no matter what kind of soup I deliver to her.

580
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:31,041
Dear, when I see you walking like that,

581
00:36:31,121 --> 00:36:33,282
I know something bad has happened.

582
00:36:33,362 --> 00:36:35,121
- What's wrong?   - Shut up.

583
00:36:35,681 --> 00:36:36,802
Yao Yao said

584
00:36:36,896 --> 00:36:39,161
she didn't intend to get married.

585
00:36:39,264 --> 00:36:41,705
Son, did you know that?

586
00:36:41,842 --> 00:36:43,601
Didn't you try to persuade her to change her mind?

587
00:36:43,681 --> 00:36:44,741
I know that.

588
00:36:44,922 --> 00:36:46,401
We have the same plans.

589
00:36:47,721 --> 00:36:50,281
Don't tell me you don't intend to take your relationship with her

590
00:36:50,601 --> 00:36:51,881
seriously?

591
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:53,362
Of course we're serious about our relationship.

592
00:36:53,442 --> 00:36:54,841
We love each other.

593
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:57,602
However, we don't need to prove it with marriage.

594
00:36:58,161 --> 00:37:00,081
I'm an experienced family law attorney.

595
00:37:00,161 --> 00:37:03,261
I know the conflicts of interest in a marriage the best.

596
00:37:03,882 --> 00:37:05,481
Not only does it not protect one's relationship,

597
00:37:05,561 --> 00:37:09,642
but it also generates conflicts within one's relationship.

598
00:37:10,033 --> 00:37:11,393
And that will lead the relationship to ruin.

599
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:14,402
Therefore, Cheng Yao and I don't want that to happen.

600
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,482
Don't worry about us.

601
00:37:16,081 --> 00:37:19,097
Have you told her that before?

602
00:37:21,002 --> 00:37:22,022
That's unnecessary.

603
00:37:22,771 --> 00:37:24,651
With the chemistry between us, there's no need for words.

604
00:37:24,802 --> 00:37:27,122
That's why I admire about her. She's on the same wavelength as me.

605
00:37:31,319 --> 00:37:33,240
Dear, I can't take this anymore.

606
00:37:33,505 --> 00:37:35,642
I'm going to faint. Dear!

607
00:37:38,201 --> 00:37:39,882
Are you dead? Why didn't you respond to me?

608
00:37:39,962 --> 00:37:42,362
I made a bet with that old fool, Cheng.

609
00:37:42,474 --> 00:37:43,673
We made a bet on

610
00:37:43,754 --> 00:37:46,321
whose grandchildren would be closer to them

611
00:37:46,402 --> 00:37:47,963
after getting married.

612
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:52,344
The loser will have to give the winner all of their assets.

613
00:37:52,721 --> 00:37:55,542
I already thought of a way to win the bet.

614
00:37:55,802 --> 00:37:56,901
But now...

615
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:00,520
Have you lost your mind?

616
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,913
You made a bet with all of our family assets?

617
00:38:03,098 --> 00:38:04,496
Did you even ask for my permission?

618
00:38:04,609 --> 00:38:07,650
Dear, you should be grateful that I didn't include you in the bet.

619
00:38:08,282 --> 00:38:10,242
- I'm sorry.   - I...

620
00:38:10,322 --> 00:38:12,070
What have I done wrong?

621
00:38:12,151 --> 00:38:14,522
Dear, I'm sorry. Have some prawns.

622
00:38:14,835 --> 00:38:16,475
Shut up!

623
00:38:17,743 --> 00:38:18,963
What are you doing?

624
00:40:01,537 --> 00:40:04,137
(Outstanding employee)

625
00:40:32,324 --> 00:40:33,329
(Cheng Xi, are you serious?)

626
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:35,161
(Are you going to join Junheng & Co as one of the partners?)

627
00:40:35,241 --> 00:40:37,650
(I'll establish a Public Welfare Department there.)

628
00:40:37,731 --> 00:40:39,071
(You're amazing.)

629
00:40:39,152 --> 00:40:40,922
(I have to work harder now.)

630
00:40:41,034 --> 00:40:42,995
(I reached home. Chat with you later.)

631
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:47,421
You're home.

632
00:40:48,848 --> 00:40:49,962
You're back.

633
00:40:50,177 --> 00:40:51,177
It must've been tough today.

634
00:40:51,258 --> 00:40:52,318
Welcome home.

635
00:40:52,721 --> 00:40:54,202
Weren't you busy today?

636
00:40:54,721 --> 00:40:56,601
I was. But there's something more important I need to tend to.

637
00:40:56,743 --> 00:40:58,463
Something more important?

638
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,231
Did you prepare all of these?

639
00:41:02,521 --> 00:41:03,521
Of course.

640
00:41:03,922 --> 00:41:06,802
Is today an anniversary or occasion I forgot?

641
00:41:06,882 --> 00:41:07,981
Nope.

642
00:41:08,762 --> 00:41:10,281
There's even a foot tub.

643
00:41:11,842 --> 00:41:14,722
I just think that someone is too busy lately.

644
00:41:14,802 --> 00:41:16,601
She almost forgot that she had a boyfriend.

645
00:41:16,681 --> 00:41:19,322
That's why I prepared a surprise for you to remind you of me.

646
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:23,570
You're not convincing at all when you're sadfishing.

647
00:41:23,721 --> 00:41:25,041
I have an outstanding boyfriend.

648
00:41:25,121 --> 00:41:28,190
I cannot catch up to you and become a partner if I don't work hard now.

649
00:41:29,842 --> 00:41:31,842
Why are you giving yourself so much pressure?

650
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:34,641
Some lawyers remained in the same position

651
00:41:34,721 --> 00:41:35,882
even after working for many years,

652
00:41:35,962 --> 00:41:36,962
am I right?

653
00:41:37,241 --> 00:41:39,461
Just go with the flow. There's no need to force yourself.

654
00:41:43,899 --> 00:41:47,573
Do you think that I won't be able to be a partner with my capabilities?

655
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:50,926
That's not it. I mean...

656
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,089
It's normal for you to think of me like that.

657
00:41:55,184 --> 00:41:56,842
That's why I have to work harder.

658
00:41:57,802 --> 00:41:59,521
By the way, Gu Bu Qing said

659
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:01,561
there was a course on property trust.

660
00:42:01,656 --> 00:42:02,936
He asked me if I wanted to join him.

661
00:42:03,947 --> 00:42:06,082
I'm pretty interested in that field.

662
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:08,553
Coincidentally, Jincheng & Co lacks experts in that field.

663
00:42:08,906 --> 00:42:11,922
I'll attend the course and take on more cases.

664
00:42:12,003 --> 00:42:14,723
Maybe I'll be a partner in five years.

665
00:42:14,955 --> 00:42:16,559
I'll make up for my lack of talent with hard work.

666
00:42:16,842 --> 00:42:17,842
He...

667
00:42:19,555 --> 00:42:22,322
The method he mentioned was inefficient and ineffective.

668
00:42:22,433 --> 00:42:23,922
You want to be a partner, right?

669
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,842
Return to our firm. I'll help you out. You'll be a partner in three years.

670
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:28,830
Why are you trying to help me again?

671
00:42:29,896 --> 00:42:32,877
By doing so, you'll make me feel like I'm useless.

672
00:42:34,114 --> 00:42:36,035
How can I grow and be independent

673
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:38,140
if I keep accepting your help?

674
00:42:39,362 --> 00:42:40,641
You're my girlfriend.

675
00:42:40,721 --> 00:42:42,059
It's my duty to help you out.

676
00:42:49,282 --> 00:42:50,722
Everyone refers to me as Qian Heng's girlfriend

677
00:42:50,833 --> 00:42:52,593
after I started going out with you.

678
00:42:53,721 --> 00:42:56,282
I'm sure they'll refer to me as Mrs. Qian instead of Lawyer Cheng Yao

679
00:42:56,432 --> 00:42:57,951
after I get married.

680
00:43:00,121 --> 00:43:01,922
I want to be more than just your accessory.

681
00:43:02,331 --> 00:43:03,762
I want to be myself.

682
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:06,327
I understand.

683
00:43:06,442 --> 00:43:08,441
But that method of his is dumb.

684
00:43:09,184 --> 00:43:10,601
What about this? I have a school reunion tomorrow.

685
00:43:10,681 --> 00:43:12,776
You should attend it with me and establish some connections.

686
00:43:12,857 --> 00:43:14,335
It'll definitely be beneficial to you.

687
00:43:14,493 --> 00:43:16,162
Did you even understand what I said?

688
00:43:16,322 --> 00:43:17,322
Of course.

689
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:25,353
Forget it.

690
00:43:25,434 --> 00:43:26,722
I won't attend your school reunion.

691
00:43:26,864 --> 00:43:28,044
Rest early.

692
00:43:28,129 --> 00:43:30,090
Wait, why are you angry?
