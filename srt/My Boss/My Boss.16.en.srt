1
00:01:35,644 --> 00:01:38,762
(My Boss)

2
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,736
(Episode 16)

3
00:01:42,817 --> 00:01:46,442
(Pretending to be my girlfriend? Are you that casual about relationships?)

4
00:01:53,035 --> 00:01:54,802
I really don't know how to thank you.

5
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:57,601
If there's anything that you need my help with in the future,

6
00:01:57,682 --> 00:01:59,162
I will definitely not refuse.

7
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,492
I heard from Wu Jun that you have insomnia.

8
00:02:05,593 --> 00:02:07,671
This is something that the locals recommended to me

9
00:02:07,757 --> 00:02:09,185
when I was traveling in Southeast Asia.

10
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:10,849
It's effective in treating insomnia.

11
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:12,162
I hope you can accept it.

12
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,335
Senior,

13
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:14,619
Cheng Yao encountered danger when she and I were

14
00:02:14,643 --> 00:02:15,763
on a business trip together.

15
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:18,450
I am grateful that you didn't blame me. I really can't take this thing.

16
00:02:18,474 --> 00:02:19,649
I...

17
00:02:19,729 --> 00:02:21,339
This thing is worthless.

18
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,290
You know what happened to me before.

19
00:02:24,382 --> 00:02:25,689
That's why I couldn't sleep.

20
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:27,770
But now, I'm almost fully recovered from insomnia.

21
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,096
It's because of its effectiveness.

22
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,680
And I bought a lot of it at the time.

23
00:02:30,827 --> 00:02:32,267
They're all collecting dust at home.

24
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:35,722
Finally, there's a chance to give it away. Just take it.

25
00:02:39,297 --> 00:02:40,402
Okay.

26
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:46,722
Senior, some dishes in this restaurant are quite popular.

27
00:02:46,842 --> 00:02:48,002
Let me take a look.

28
00:02:55,179 --> 00:02:56,379
Qian Heng.

29
00:02:57,522 --> 00:03:00,700
I have some experience in the trust business.

30
00:03:01,203 --> 00:03:03,962
If your law firm needs my help in the future,

31
00:03:04,593 --> 00:03:05,793
please let me know.

32
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:08,969
Sure. If I have any questions, you'll be the first person I ask.

33
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,402
Qian,

34
00:03:30,802 --> 00:03:32,362
you're getting naughty.

35
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:35,260
You're starting to play tricks on me.

36
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,162
Do you have any conscience?

37
00:03:39,455 --> 00:03:42,494
I helped you turn down Tang Bing's case.

38
00:03:42,575 --> 00:03:44,747
And, you actually met Cheng Xi behind my back.

39
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:46,089
Why did you do that?

40
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:47,882
What gave you the impression

41
00:03:47,947 --> 00:03:49,425
that if I wanted to hide it from you,

42
00:03:49,449 --> 00:03:50,740
you would easily find out?

43
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,339
Then, shouldn't you have taken the opportunity to bring me along

44
00:03:53,363 --> 00:03:55,569
so we could have more chances to meet?

45
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:57,409
I don't do things that annoy people.

46
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,970
Oh, right. I almost forgot to tell you.

47
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:03,369
Senior Cheng Xi gave me a few pieces of calming incense.

48
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:04,929
You don't have this treatment, right?

49
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:12,082
Okay.

50
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:13,900
How much? Just give me a price.

51
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,939
A fixed price of 100,000 yuan.

52
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,482
Are you crazy?

53
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,762
Although my sleep has improved recently,

54
00:04:21,835 --> 00:04:23,577
if I don't accept Senior Cheng Xi's kind gesture,

55
00:04:23,601 --> 00:04:24,754
it's not appropriate, right?

56
00:04:24,835 --> 00:04:28,215
Okay. Then, I'll call Tang Bing now and tell him

57
00:04:28,296 --> 00:04:30,710
that we are discussing again whether to re-take his case.

58
00:04:30,827 --> 00:04:33,026
Anyway, he went to the Law Association to file a complaint.

59
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,010
It affects the reputation of our entire law firm.

60
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,328
Which one is more important?

61
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:37,689
Someone needs to think about it.

62
00:04:37,888 --> 00:04:39,529
Cheng Xi met me because of Cheng Yao's matter.

63
00:04:39,553 --> 00:04:42,153
Don't drag Cheng Yao into this. What does she have to do with it?

64
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,400
Tang Bing wanted to take advantage of her and got beaten up by me.

65
00:04:46,602 --> 00:04:47,802
Is it true or not?

66
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,130
Have I ever lied to you?

67
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,040
And, he still dares to complain to the Law Association?

68
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,522
This bastard. I'll make sure to sue him until he's bankrupt.

69
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,880
Don't make a fuss. Cheng Yao has finally forgotten about this incident.

70
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:02,529
Do you still want to look for him?

71
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:05,619
Then, let's not look for him for now.

72
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,602
Well.

73
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,880
Fine. I give up the firm's profit sharing next month, all right?

74
00:05:20,852 --> 00:05:22,052
Wu,

75
00:05:23,075 --> 00:05:25,193
the way Cheng Xi talked to me today,

76
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:26,642
I feel like it was too serious.

77
00:05:27,433 --> 00:05:30,164
Maybe, when Cheng Yao explained it to her, she was too vague.

78
00:05:30,351 --> 00:05:32,282
I don't know. Maybe she misunderstood.

79
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,018
- Did she say anything to you? - No.

80
00:05:38,082 --> 00:05:39,201
Qian.

81
00:05:39,282 --> 00:05:40,522
Can you teach me Sanda?

82
00:05:40,765 --> 00:05:42,393
Do you think you can beat me just by learning it?

83
00:05:42,417 --> 00:05:43,846
Who wants to fight you?

84
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:45,499
I have someone to protect.

85
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,170
Can we have a session tomorrow?

86
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,240
Where did you go?

87
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:10,442
You dressed well.

88
00:06:11,602 --> 00:06:12,912
You went on a secret date, didn't you?

89
00:06:12,936 --> 00:06:14,402
What does it have to do with you?

90
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,930
You let go of our relationship, just like that.

91
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:18,522
Do you think that's fair to me?

92
00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:22,459
Letting go is the biggest mercy I have for you.

93
00:06:22,812 --> 00:06:25,564
Don't push me. I could reveal all the things you did in the past.

94
00:06:26,343 --> 00:06:28,170
Is it fun to keep bringing up the past?

95
00:06:28,335 --> 00:06:29,858
I have explained it to you so many times.

96
00:06:29,882 --> 00:06:32,477
No matter what I do, you are always in my heart.

97
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,842
Since you are always in my heart,

98
00:06:33,866 --> 00:06:36,246
can I just watch you be with another man?

99
00:06:36,327 --> 00:06:39,290
I need you to understand that I am single.

100
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,139
It's only natural for me to go on dates with anyone now.

101
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:44,762
Come back. Don't you know what's good for you?

102
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:46,569
Let me tell you.

103
00:06:46,711 --> 00:06:48,322
I'm doing this for your own good.

104
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,482
You're in your thirties,

105
00:06:50,687 --> 00:06:52,937
divorced, and have nothing.

106
00:06:54,968 --> 00:06:56,945
Except for me, your ex-husband, who accepts you without any grudges,

107
00:06:56,969 --> 00:06:58,769
who else can be as tolerant as me toward you?

108
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:03,090
Divorce is the end of our previous relationship.

109
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:06,009
Don't always belittle me and elevate yourself every time you see me.

110
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:07,745
What now? Will you be happy for a few days

111
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:09,180
just by saying these few words?

112
00:07:13,034 --> 00:07:14,682
Cheng Xi, do you always think

113
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:16,279
that our divorce is all my fault?

114
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,331
Do you not have any flaws at all for our marriage to reach this point?

115
00:07:20,851 --> 00:07:22,051
Let me tell you.

116
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:25,722
A divorced woman is just someone who got dumped.

117
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:29,042
You got dumped. Why are you still here acting all high and mighty,

118
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:30,889
feeling like you're different from others?

119
00:07:30,942 --> 00:07:33,232
Do you see yourself as a modern woman?

120
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:36,114
Cheng Xi, you're a lawyer,

121
00:07:36,195 --> 00:07:37,459
an intellectual.

122
00:07:38,329 --> 00:07:40,305
Stop reading those inspirational quotes every day.

123
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:44,780
And, stop going out every day to search for a new life, to find love.

124
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:46,466
It's all just deceiving young girls.

125
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:47,650
So, according to you,

126
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:48,769
a divorced woman,

127
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:50,611
no matter how successful she is in her career,

128
00:07:50,635 --> 00:07:51,893
she's worthless. Is that right?

129
00:07:51,974 --> 00:07:54,134
Yes, a woman's primary task

130
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,482
is to return to her family and be a virtuous helper.

131
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,560
A divorced woman is considered damaged goods.

132
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,002
You are damaged goods. Shouldn't you try harder to please men?

133
00:08:03,138 --> 00:08:05,327
Dressing up and going out on dates every day,

134
00:08:05,408 --> 00:08:07,042
what's the point? What are you thinking?

135
00:08:07,374 --> 00:08:09,442
Wu Jun has been pursuing you for a few days, and you are already tempted.

136
00:08:09,466 --> 00:08:10,626
Let me tell you.

137
00:08:10,769 --> 00:08:12,602
He's just attracted to the novelty of you.

138
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:15,540
Once the novelty wears off, he will dump you.

139
00:08:15,716 --> 00:08:18,819
Then, you'll know I'm still the best to you.

140
00:08:21,922 --> 00:08:22,929
Deng Ming.

141
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,242
It's not that you're good,

142
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,737
but that I am.

143
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,620
You won't find anyone else who will treat you as well as I did.

144
00:08:29,049 --> 00:08:30,459
But, let me tell you,

145
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:32,517
I was willing to do anything to be with you back then.

146
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,762
But now, when I say I'm leaving you, I will leave you for good

147
00:08:34,786 --> 00:08:36,402
because I will always be true to myself.

148
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:37,849
But, look at you.

149
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,140
You are incompetent in life, like a giant baby.

150
00:08:40,258 --> 00:08:43,515
When I wholeheartedly treated you, you were arrogant.

151
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:45,584
Now, in your marriage, you are at a disadvantage.

152
00:08:45,694 --> 00:08:47,849
And, you turn around to harass me. You're disgusting!

153
00:08:47,952 --> 00:08:49,362
You're miserable, not me.

154
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,468
- What are you doing? - Calling the police.

155
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,080
Calling the police? Who are you trying to scare?

156
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:58,489
Come on. Call the police.

157
00:08:58,569 --> 00:08:59,769
Call the police.

158
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,522
Cheng Xi, let me tell you.

159
00:09:09,732 --> 00:09:12,363
One day, you will come crying to me.

160
00:09:12,809 --> 00:09:14,009
I'll be waiting.

161
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,300
Will you leave or not?

162
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,442
Will you leave or not?

163
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,640
I'll just leave. Why are you yelling at me?

164
00:09:53,888 --> 00:09:55,008
Lemon Mascot.

165
00:09:55,163 --> 00:09:56,363
Why are you here?

166
00:09:59,457 --> 00:10:00,657
Boss.

167
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:02,580
What does this mean?

168
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,600
I'm giving this Lemon Mascot to you.

169
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:06,867
Giving it to me?

170
00:10:07,289 --> 00:10:08,442
I don't want it anymore.

171
00:10:08,536 --> 00:10:10,386
But, didn't you like it so much?

172
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,522
How is this possible?

173
00:10:12,761 --> 00:10:14,921
This thing doesn't match the style of my villa at all.

174
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,170
I don't want to live with it.

175
00:10:17,756 --> 00:10:18,917
Oh, right.

176
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,842
Aren't you supposed to live in the villa?

177
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,842
Why are you wearing pajamas?

178
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,721
Have you decided to move back completely?

179
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,780
What's wrong?

180
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,320
I'm a legal tenant who pays rent.

181
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,946
Do I have to report to you when I come back?

182
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,810
You already stood me up once. And now, you're questioning where I live.

183
00:10:35,145 --> 00:10:37,018
Boss, you do you, as long as you're happy.

184
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:41,562
This is for you. No need to thank me.

185
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,090
Breaking news!

186
00:10:57,418 --> 00:10:58,530
Zhu the admin said

187
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,306
that we will have a second retreat this year.

188
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,489
- Our boss specially arranged it. - Really?

189
00:11:02,569 --> 00:11:03,809
Let's be more cautious.

190
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:05,609
The firm hasn't sent an official email yet.

191
00:11:05,669 --> 00:11:07,842
And, we just lost Tang Bing's case recently.

192
00:11:08,077 --> 00:11:10,182
A vacation? Can we even meet our year-end performance goal?

193
00:11:10,206 --> 00:11:12,569
Yu Xiao Fei, try to relax a little, all right?

194
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:15,120
With your team lead here, it will only take a few minutes to meet it.

195
00:11:15,144 --> 00:11:16,910
We must have a life outside of work.

196
00:11:16,991 --> 00:11:19,351
- This time, I stand with your team lead. - That's right.

197
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,450
I told you.

198
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,322
I thought of a place.

199
00:11:29,441 --> 00:11:30,816
There are mountains and water.

200
00:11:30,917 --> 00:11:32,922
The air is fresh and it's quiet there.

201
00:11:33,198 --> 00:11:34,518
It's much more fun than an amusement park.

202
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:36,002
There's also a flower field.

203
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,122
The scenery is beautiful.

204
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:39,522
When you walk in,

205
00:11:39,614 --> 00:11:41,242
you'll feel like time has slowed down.

206
00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:43,249
The whole scene is full of the spring vibe.

207
00:11:45,588 --> 00:11:47,602
Cheng Yao.

208
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,946
Do you think our boss has some good news recently?

209
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,169
He looks and feels different.

210
00:11:51,289 --> 00:11:53,449
When people have good news, they'll be in a good mood.

211
00:11:55,374 --> 00:11:56,991
Last time, when I was on a business trip with him,

212
00:11:57,015 --> 00:11:59,609
he said that your performance this year is particularly good.

213
00:11:59,689 --> 00:12:01,500
So, he's rewarding you with a retreat.

214
00:12:04,275 --> 00:12:05,522
Is it true?

215
00:12:05,861 --> 00:12:07,301
Was it arranged specifically for me?

216
00:12:11,921 --> 00:12:15,002
Although I know that I hold an important place in his heart,

217
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:18,842
I feel quite embarrassed that he always favors and spoils me.

218
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,142
After all, I don't want to be the troublesome companion of a ruler

219
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,846
who makes him tyrannical, issues stupid orders, and causes trouble.

220
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,120
I'm worried.

221
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:28,729
Are you worried or just showing off?

222
00:12:28,817 --> 00:12:31,257
I see that your face is bigger than the three of us combined.

223
00:12:32,515 --> 00:12:35,025
I recently found out about a face mask that has a buy-two-free-one deal.

224
00:12:35,049 --> 00:12:36,809
It's just enough for you to use all at once.

225
00:12:37,098 --> 00:12:38,298
Jealousy.

226
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:39,780
Blatant jealousy.

227
00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:46,156
The boss wants to give me a big case.

228
00:12:47,153 --> 00:12:48,634
I'm his true love. It's a big case.

229
00:12:48,738 --> 00:12:50,202
Well...

230
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,849
This doesn't seem like a big case.

231
00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:54,002
- Let me see. - What kind of case is this?

232
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,842
Luo Yang Yang's inheritance dispute case.

233
00:12:58,306 --> 00:13:00,370
The amount involved is 2 million yuan.

234
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,729
The opposing lawyer is Yao Feng.

235
00:13:02,809 --> 00:13:04,019
The executing lawyer is Bao Rui.

236
00:13:04,043 --> 00:13:05,122
And the assistant lawyer is Cheng Yao.

237
00:13:05,146 --> 00:13:06,562
(So, he still remembers.)

238
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,162
(He took on this case to avenge me, right?)

239
00:13:09,461 --> 00:13:10,808
(He has been so good to me, )

240
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:12,620
(but I've been causing him trouble.)

241
00:13:12,914 --> 00:13:14,579
(It's fine if I don't have any achievements at work.)

242
00:13:14,603 --> 00:13:16,773
(But, I'm also putting my mind on other things.)

243
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,482
(Cheng Yao.)

244
00:13:18,656 --> 00:13:20,282
(You're such a failure.)

245
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,770
Our boss is really abnormal.

246
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,679
Usually, he shouldn't have taken this case.

247
00:13:24,765 --> 00:13:25,965
Who is Yao Feng?

248
00:13:26,241 --> 00:13:28,225
I don't know. But there's no such name

249
00:13:28,305 --> 00:13:30,785
in the list of partners in major law firms across the country.

250
00:13:32,451 --> 00:13:33,682
Cheng Yao, do you know him?

251
00:13:33,842 --> 00:13:35,367
How could she know him?

252
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:37,545
I don't even know him. How could a newcomer know him?

253
00:13:37,569 --> 00:13:40,180
Cheng Yao, don't worry. I will protect you.

254
00:13:41,314 --> 00:13:42,682
I will prepare well.

255
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:46,682
Annoying. This is such a small case.

256
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:48,299
(I must win this case.)

257
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:49,882
(I can't let the boss down.)

258
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:53,049
Our client and Yao Feng's client are siblings.

259
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,384
And, she has taken care of her father alone for almost 10 years.

260
00:13:55,408 --> 00:13:56,642
Now, she is sick herself.

261
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,362
So, she really needs this inheritance.

262
00:13:58,478 --> 00:14:00,558
No matter what, I have to help her win this lawsuit.

263
00:14:01,169 --> 00:14:03,426
But, from my interactions with her, I feel like she has been

264
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:05,606
influenced by her family's traditional views on gender roles.

265
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,265
I'm afraid that if she is provoked in court,

266
00:14:07,289 --> 00:14:08,939
she might change her mind last minute.

267
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,377
So, you must

268
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,527
communicate with her more, guide her in the right direction,

269
00:14:13,551 --> 00:14:15,113
and strengthen her confidence

270
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:17,656
so that she won't think we're only refusing to settle

271
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,482
because we're after the lawyer fee.

272
00:14:19,563 --> 00:14:21,243
If that happens, it'd be tricky to handle.

273
00:14:21,347 --> 00:14:22,877
No problem, Bao.

274
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,562
But, Bao,

275
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:27,780
I didn't expect you to be so attentive and considerate toward girls.

276
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,322
I learned it all from our boss.

277
00:14:30,931 --> 00:14:32,682
Actually, he has a very meticulous mind.

278
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:34,609
So, here's the question.

279
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:37,739
If he has a very meticulous mind, why hasn't anyone noticed it yet?

280
00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:41,290
Because his meticulous mind is all directed toward me.

281
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,939
But, don't worry. I have already investigated that lawyer, Yao Feng.

282
00:14:50,184 --> 00:14:52,474
This guy only knows how to drink and socialize.

283
00:14:52,569 --> 00:14:53,738
He doesn't even know the laws well.

284
00:14:53,762 --> 00:14:56,962
On the contrary, I am the one who will inherit the future of Junheng & Co.

285
00:14:57,036 --> 00:15:00,042
And now, with you as my assistant, we can handle him together.

286
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:01,962
Not just handle, but handle him to death!

287
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,162
Stop chatting. You have work to do. Work.

288
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,410
I just can't figure it out.

289
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:17,609
Our boss just rejected Tang Bing's big case,

290
00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:20,002
and then took on this very small one.

291
00:15:20,515 --> 00:15:21,562
What's the point?

292
00:15:21,656 --> 00:15:23,056
And, he said we must win this case.

293
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:27,958
Maybe he wants a diverse portfolio for the firm.

294
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:29,562
What do you mean by "diverse"?

295
00:15:29,643 --> 00:15:31,119
I've taken on dozens of these cases.

296
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,416
I win every time. I don't feel any sense of accomplishment anymore.

297
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,139
But you're promoting justice, Bao.

298
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,420
That's true.

299
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,411
But our boss told me that I can't lose this case.

300
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:43,969
If I do, I won't get my year-end bonus.

301
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,450
Why?

302
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:52,089
I understand now.

303
00:15:52,929 --> 00:15:54,339
He wants to help me relieve stress.

304
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:55,877
You see. I've recently handled many cases,

305
00:15:55,901 --> 00:15:57,042
all kinds of messy ones.

306
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:00,090
I am under a lot of pressure, all right? So, our boss specifically chose

307
00:16:00,143 --> 00:16:02,583
a lawyer with bad character and skill to let me bully.

308
00:16:02,889 --> 00:16:05,522
Bullying is so satisfying. He even reminded me

309
00:16:06,002 --> 00:16:07,625
not to care about the other party's feelings.

310
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:09,129
Just offend him to my heart's content

311
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,920
and let myself go wild.

312
00:16:11,016 --> 00:16:12,242
I will use my legal knowledge

313
00:16:12,362 --> 00:16:14,185
to humiliate him, trample him, and crush him.

314
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:15,700
I will trample on his soul.

315
00:16:15,781 --> 00:16:17,899
I want him to kneel before me in court. He will learn his lesson.

316
00:16:17,923 --> 00:16:20,243
He will cling to my leg and say, "Bao Rui, you're amazing.

317
00:16:20,283 --> 00:16:22,762
You're a star in the legal world, while I'm just a peanut.

318
00:16:22,843 --> 00:16:23,937
Can you let me off the hook?

319
00:16:23,961 --> 00:16:26,560
Do you still have job openings?"

320
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:27,969
Ah, feels so good.

321
00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:31,066
The case hasn't even started yet, but I already feel good.

322
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,290
I feel victorious.

323
00:16:34,569 --> 00:16:36,682
Our boss is so considerate toward me.

324
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:38,329
To repay his favor,

325
00:16:38,503 --> 00:16:40,274
we must definitely win this lawsuit.

326
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,922
Okay, I got it. All right. I will pay attention to this case.

327
00:16:48,289 --> 00:16:50,242
Okay, no problem. Don't rush me.

328
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:51,784
Just trust me.

329
00:16:52,489 --> 00:16:54,833
- No problem. - Bao. Go in first.

330
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:56,522
- I will come in later. - Okay.

331
00:16:56,973 --> 00:16:59,242
It's almost a sure win, you know?

332
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:00,650
No problem.

333
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,042
Okay.

334
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,922
Mr. Yao.

335
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,122
- I'll hang up first. - Long time no see.

336
00:17:07,553 --> 00:17:09,883
Cheng Yao, it's really you.

337
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,120
Although you used to be my pupil,

338
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,962
I won't show any mercy in court later.

339
00:17:16,121 --> 00:17:17,882
Please don't show any mercy.

340
00:17:18,626 --> 00:17:20,265
Although you used to be my mentor,

341
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:23,340
I will do my best in court later.

342
00:17:23,564 --> 00:17:25,402
If I win against you, please don't be upset.

343
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,779
Wow, you're quite arrogant.

344
00:17:29,454 --> 00:17:31,774
How could I not know how good you are?

345
00:17:31,855 --> 00:17:32,935
Let me tell you, Cheng Yao.

346
00:17:32,963 --> 00:17:35,722
You entered Junheng & Co out of pure luck.

347
00:17:35,883 --> 00:17:37,019
The truth will be revealed in court.

348
00:17:37,043 --> 00:17:39,147
Don't cry and go to your boss later.

349
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,042
Who the heck are you?

350
00:17:45,767 --> 00:17:49,256
- What happened? - It's nothing. I ran into the opposing counsel.

351
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,210
He's an old fox

352
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:55,409
who uses pre-trial communication as a cover to intimidate young lawyers.

353
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,136
You don't have to worry about it. With your current level,

354
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,280
you can handle him one-on-one without any problem.

355
00:18:00,851 --> 00:18:02,131
Our boss just loves me too much.

356
00:18:02,196 --> 00:18:03,836
He wants me to be involved in every case.

357
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,859
Otherwise, you alone would be enough for this case.

358
00:18:05,883 --> 00:18:07,573
Not to mention, I'm here.

359
00:18:09,162 --> 00:18:10,322
Let's go.

360
00:18:12,664 --> 00:18:15,685
(Authorized Agents)

361
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,482
(Authorized Agent, Claimant)

362
00:18:31,563 --> 00:18:35,642
(Defendant, Authorized Agent)

363
00:18:49,104 --> 00:18:50,362
Lawyer Yao.

364
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:53,602
Actually, I really admire you. Really.

365
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,762
I've heard about your name for a long time.

366
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,642
Can we have dinner together tonight? I'll treat you, really.

367
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,929
So we can discuss how you lost your case.

368
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,100
What's wrong? Don't be angry.

369
00:19:06,561 --> 00:19:07,762
You have no grace at all.

370
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,329
Who the heck are you?

371
00:19:15,266 --> 00:19:17,242
How was it? Was it satisfying?

372
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,410
Extremely satisfying.

373
00:19:20,906 --> 00:19:22,411
This is the love our boss has for us.

374
00:19:22,515 --> 00:19:23,802
This kind of satisfaction

375
00:19:23,931 --> 00:19:25,571
can't be bought with any amount of money.

376
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:27,762
Why did he choose Yao Feng?

377
00:19:27,938 --> 00:19:29,202
It's a bit too easy.

378
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:30,896
There's no challenge in winning this.

379
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:34,090
Let's go.

380
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:46,842
(Should I send a message to thank him?)

381
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,760
(No need to thank me.)

382
00:19:55,289 --> 00:19:57,562
(Just treat me to the seafood dinner as you promised.)

383
00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:03,522
(I'm on my way to buy groceries.)

384
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,602
(Okay. That's good.)

385
00:20:12,728 --> 00:20:14,202
(Besides seafood dinner, )

386
00:20:14,361 --> 00:20:17,060
(I'll work even harder to repay you, boss.)

387
00:20:25,228 --> 00:20:27,562
(Forget about the seafood dinner. Just come home! Now!)

388
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,120
Mom.

389
00:20:45,139 --> 00:20:46,339
Why are you here?

390
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,360
Your dad and I came to visit

391
00:20:48,504 --> 00:20:49,873
and bring you some food.

392
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,042
I didn't expect you to live with this person.

393
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,242
Luckily, your dad went fishing.

394
00:20:55,373 --> 00:20:57,634
If he saw this, I don't know what would happen.

395
00:20:57,815 --> 00:20:59,562
Madam, I've already told you.

396
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:01,082
I am Cheng Yao's boss.

397
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,240
Just admit that you're her boyfriend.

398
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:05,042
Don't you have the courage to admit it?

399
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,642
Cheng Yao. Look at your taste in men.

400
00:21:07,945 --> 00:21:09,145
Explain it yourself.

401
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,560
Mom, he really is my boss.

402
00:21:11,681 --> 00:21:13,753
When I first came to this unit,

403
00:21:13,907 --> 00:21:15,827
it was double-rented by the landlord.

404
00:21:16,071 --> 00:21:18,850
So, we agreed eventually that we'd share the unit.

405
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,553
But, when I got to work, I found out he's actually my boss.

406
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:24,722
This is like the plot of an idol drama.

407
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,240
Do you think your mom doesn't watch TV dramas?

408
00:21:29,368 --> 00:21:33,060
This person will make up any excuse to take advantage of you.

409
00:21:33,243 --> 00:21:34,803
Madam, what does taking advantage mean?

410
00:21:34,834 --> 00:21:35,873
Men and women are equal.

411
00:21:35,954 --> 00:21:37,299
Even if it's cohabitation before marriage,

412
00:21:37,323 --> 00:21:39,803
everyone has the right and chance to cut their losses in time.

413
00:21:40,126 --> 00:21:43,368
You wouldn't have really taken advantage of Yao Yao, would you?

414
00:21:43,449 --> 00:21:46,299
Mom. He really is my boss.

415
00:21:47,064 --> 00:21:49,008
And, even if someone were to take advantage,

416
00:21:49,089 --> 00:21:51,329
with his status, it would be me taking advantage of him.

417
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,600
Don't lie to me.

418
00:21:52,782 --> 00:21:55,476
You often complain on the phone that your boss

419
00:21:55,556 --> 00:21:57,610
always exploits his subordinates,

420
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:58,974
has no morals and conscience,

421
00:21:59,055 --> 00:22:01,420
and accepts any client just to make money.

422
00:22:01,569 --> 00:22:02,729
Besides,

423
00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:05,969
what is the rent for this unit in this neighborhood?

424
00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:07,259
Can't I tell?

425
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,929
Your boss is so rich.

426
00:22:09,064 --> 00:22:11,553
Why would he live in a place like this with you?

427
00:22:13,087 --> 00:22:15,178
Yes, Mom. He is my boyfriend.

428
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,762
I knew it.

429
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:22,709
Cheng Yao. Don't be fooled by his handsome appearance.

430
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:23,950
He can be very cunning.

431
00:22:24,031 --> 00:22:25,591
Don't be naive and let him deceive you.

432
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,529
Mom.

433
00:22:27,609 --> 00:22:29,762
We really live here to save money.

434
00:22:30,108 --> 00:22:32,370
Really. Also, we've been sleeping in separate rooms.

435
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:33,764
If you don't believe me, go check it out.

436
00:22:33,788 --> 00:22:36,107
We follow the principle of "love comes from understanding and respect".

437
00:22:36,131 --> 00:22:38,082
There's nothing like what you're imagining.

438
00:22:38,882 --> 00:22:40,402
I actually want to check it out.

439
00:22:48,369 --> 00:22:49,569
Boss.

440
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,600
I'm sorry, boss.

441
00:22:51,858 --> 00:22:53,763
Can you please pretend for me? Just for a little bit.

442
00:22:53,787 --> 00:22:55,482
Otherwise, my mom won't leave today.

443
00:23:02,718 --> 00:23:04,242
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

444
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:08,850
Qian.

445
00:23:09,329 --> 00:23:10,922
What do you do for work?

446
00:23:11,127 --> 00:23:13,562
- Madam, I... - He worked in a factory.

447
00:23:13,735 --> 00:23:16,682
He recently got laid off and has just become unemployed.

448
00:23:16,776 --> 00:23:17,976
Unemployed?

449
00:23:19,569 --> 00:23:20,842
What is your education level?

450
00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:22,580
What did you study?

451
00:23:22,783 --> 00:23:24,032
Is it easy to find a job?

452
00:23:24,354 --> 00:23:25,554
He has a vocational degree.

453
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,200
He graduated from a vocational school.

454
00:23:28,265 --> 00:23:30,306
He was just a factory worker.

455
00:23:30,433 --> 00:23:32,242
Yes. Just a laborer.

456
00:23:33,089 --> 00:23:35,482
No. You don't seem like it based on your demeanor.

457
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:38,422
Did you drop out of school because you were poor when young?

458
00:23:38,712 --> 00:23:40,521
Young people should strive for progress.

459
00:23:40,849 --> 00:23:42,449
You don't even have a bachelor's degree.

460
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:44,100
It's not easy for you to make a living.

461
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,280
His family background is still decent.

462
00:23:46,318 --> 00:23:48,037
It's not a problem for him to go to school.

463
00:23:48,061 --> 00:23:49,162
Mom,

464
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:53,282
don't be fooled by his smart appearance.

465
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,372
In fact, he's not very bright.

466
00:23:56,447 --> 00:23:58,510
He only has a good-looking face.

467
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,811
What now that he is unemployed?

468
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,090
I'll support him. I work full-time in the morning and part-time at night.

469
00:24:12,529 --> 00:24:13,820
How can that be?

470
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:17,186
Now, women aren't just homemakers, and men aren't just breadwinners.

471
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:18,334
If he can't make money,

472
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,535
it's also good to stay at home and be content. Right?

473
00:24:21,898 --> 00:24:23,442
- Uh... - Mom, don't worry.

474
00:24:24,219 --> 00:24:25,756
You finally came out to have some fun.

475
00:24:25,848 --> 00:24:27,482
But, you're monitoring me here. What a waste.

476
00:24:27,506 --> 00:24:30,037
Also, next time, make sure to call me if you want to visit me,

477
00:24:30,118 --> 00:24:31,158
so I can come pick you up.

478
00:24:31,209 --> 00:24:32,575
Don't think I don't know what you're up to.

479
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:34,922
You're afraid that your dad and I will disturb you, right?

480
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:38,570
Qian, let me tell you.

481
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,842
Her dad and I don't live too far from you.

482
00:24:41,111 --> 00:24:43,202
It only takes half an hour by high-speed rail.

483
00:24:43,998 --> 00:24:45,720
You can't bully Yao Yao.

484
00:24:45,873 --> 00:24:48,451
If you bully her, you'll regret it.

485
00:24:48,569 --> 00:24:49,769
He definitely won't.

486
00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:52,557
Mom. You see, this place can't fit you.

487
00:24:52,638 --> 00:24:54,146
Let me take you downstairs first. It's late.

488
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:56,313
- Dad must be waiting for you. - I won't stay at your place.

489
00:24:56,337 --> 00:24:58,153
I'm staying at my relative's place. Don't pull me.

490
00:24:58,177 --> 00:24:59,682
I still have something to say to him.

491
00:25:00,434 --> 00:25:03,004
- Let's go. - No, I'm telling you...

492
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,602
You're such a bad kid.

493
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,025
I haven't finished talking yet. And, you're already pushing me out.

494
00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:12,682
- Why are you... - It's pretty late.

495
00:25:12,763 --> 00:25:14,162
It's pretty late?

496
00:25:14,257 --> 00:25:15,457
Yao Yao.

497
00:25:16,362 --> 00:25:18,459
I didn't say you can't date.

498
00:25:18,569 --> 00:25:19,701
With your qualifications,

499
00:25:19,782 --> 00:25:21,322
dating a laborer

500
00:25:21,769 --> 00:25:23,100
is not appropriate.

501
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,107
Well, I don't dislike him just because he is poor.

502
00:25:26,131 --> 00:25:29,203
You two will have to live together for a lifetime. It's not a good match.

503
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,594
You two will think differently in the future. It'll be miserable.

504
00:25:31,618 --> 00:25:33,202
- Do you know? - I know.

505
00:25:33,656 --> 00:25:35,809
I will seriously consider it. Go find your husband.

506
00:25:35,944 --> 00:25:37,616
- Remember what I said. - I will remember.

507
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,602
You better remember it. You, bad kid.

508
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,202
(Yeah. It's really a mismatch.)

509
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,049
Boss, I'm sorry.

510
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:00,070
Boyfriend?

511
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,120
My mother didn't believe me when I said you are my boss.

512
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:06,675
I just wanted my mom to leave quickly. That's why I said that.

513
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,482
Okay, then tell me.

514
00:26:09,751 --> 00:26:10,951
How will you support me?

515
00:26:13,089 --> 00:26:15,620
I said what I said because I really had no choice just now.

516
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:18,890
If I said your net worth is over a billion,

517
00:26:19,053 --> 00:26:21,489
my mom would definitely rush me to marry you.

518
00:26:21,927 --> 00:26:23,069
That's why

519
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:25,322
I said you're a factory worker.

520
00:26:25,522 --> 00:26:28,345
This way, it will be easier to tell her that we broke up in the future.

521
00:26:28,369 --> 00:26:29,620
It's all part of the act.

522
00:26:32,972 --> 00:26:35,890
Boss, I know I was wrong. Please don't stoop to my level. Okay?

523
00:26:36,073 --> 00:26:41,015
Boss, if next time, your mom pressures you to get married,

524
00:26:41,096 --> 00:26:43,402
I'll pretend to be your girlfriend. Is that okay?

525
00:26:43,527 --> 00:26:45,002
Pretending to be my girlfriend?

526
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,090
Cheng Yao. You treat relationships so casually.

527
00:26:49,673 --> 00:26:50,959
Your year-end bonus is gone.

528
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,240
Boss.

529
00:26:53,905 --> 00:26:58,137
Your behavior doesn't quite comply with the Labor Contract Law.

530
00:26:59,105 --> 00:27:00,876
As a lawyer, you shouldn't break the law.

531
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,800
Boss, can I take you out to dinner to make it up to you? Is that okay?

532
00:27:11,161 --> 00:27:12,651
I'm really sorry.

533
00:27:17,536 --> 00:27:19,202
Also, thank you for helping me

534
00:27:20,048 --> 00:27:21,482
with the Yao Feng incident.

535
00:27:25,317 --> 00:27:28,562
(Boss)

536
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,832
(Boss. To apologize sincerely for my offense yesterday, )

537
00:27:35,913 --> 00:27:38,674
(I would like to invite you to have Western food after work tonight.)

538
00:27:38,721 --> 00:27:40,071
(I have already made a reservation.)

539
00:27:40,095 --> 00:27:42,335
(I hope you can receive and reply to this message soon.)

540
00:27:48,329 --> 00:27:50,355
You don't seem to be in a good state early in the morning.

541
00:27:50,379 --> 00:27:51,908
Did you not rest well last night?

542
00:27:53,314 --> 00:27:55,522
Maybe I've been too tired lately, so I caught a cold.

543
00:27:55,709 --> 00:27:56,919
Thank you, Tan Ying.

544
00:27:57,569 --> 00:28:00,380
Take care, since you're working with Lawyer Qian, a workaholic.

545
00:28:01,064 --> 00:28:03,602
All right, I'm going out on assignment. All the best.

546
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,202
You too. All the best.

547
00:28:32,891 --> 00:28:34,934
Why haven't you replied to my message?

548
00:28:35,123 --> 00:28:37,452
You wouldn't actually deduct my year-end bonus, would you?

549
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,160
Ting Ting.

550
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:46,547
(I'm so angry! I can't take it anymore!)

551
00:28:46,628 --> 00:28:49,348
(I don't want to spend another day with him! I want to divorce him.)

552
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,930
What? Where are you?

553
00:28:52,061 --> 00:28:55,038
(I'm at the place where we often have desserts.)

554
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:56,448
Wait for me. I'll be there soon.

555
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:06,522
Let's leave it at that for today.

556
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:09,380
Lawyer Qian. Let's have a casual dinner tonight.

557
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,410
Sorry. I have another appointment tonight.

558
00:29:13,515 --> 00:29:15,729
I will do my best with the case. You can trust me.

559
00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:17,009
I absolutely trust you.

560
00:29:17,171 --> 00:29:18,371
Take care.

561
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,640
What's wrong, Ting Ting?

562
00:29:26,987 --> 00:29:28,067
I can't take it anymore.

563
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:30,689
I can't spend another day with him. I want to divorce him.

564
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,810
Okay. Calm down.

565
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,330
Tell me slowly.

566
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:34,610
What happened?

567
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,680
So, as you know,

568
00:29:36,813 --> 00:29:39,242
when we got married, we didn't have a wedding banquet.

569
00:29:39,793 --> 00:29:41,005
I thought at that time,

570
00:29:41,086 --> 00:29:42,602
when we move into our new home,

571
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:45,009
we'll invite everyone over for a meal.

572
00:29:45,089 --> 00:29:47,170
Right? I told him about it a long time ago,

573
00:29:47,265 --> 00:29:48,820
and he agreed at the time.

574
00:29:48,992 --> 00:29:51,832
But, when I asked him yesterday, he just told me he's not doing it anymore.

575
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:53,149
Why not?

576
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:56,991
You can just have a small gathering with your close friends and family.

577
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,240
Exactly. I asked him too.

578
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,690
He didn't say anything

579
00:30:01,769 --> 00:30:02,850
and even found me annoying.

580
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:06,057
And I rarely saw him in the past half month.

581
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:07,660
So, we ended up arguing.

582
00:30:07,862 --> 00:30:10,872
He said I don't earn a single penny

583
00:30:11,061 --> 00:30:12,562
and spend all his money.

584
00:30:12,709 --> 00:30:14,322
He called me useless

585
00:30:14,585 --> 00:30:16,105
and said he doesn't want our kid anymore.

586
00:30:16,129 --> 00:30:18,449
I feel like I can't go on like this even for one more day.

587
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,240
Ting Ting, you're pregnant now.

588
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:22,082
Being angry is not good for your health.

589
00:30:22,405 --> 00:30:24,440
What if Hao Zi was just saying it out of anger?

590
00:30:24,529 --> 00:30:25,729
Right?

591
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:28,380
All right. Don't worry for now.

592
00:30:28,769 --> 00:30:31,499
If he really bullies you, I won't let him get away with it.

593
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:18,122
Sir, would you like me to heat this up for you?

594
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:19,722
No. Thank you.

595
00:31:19,804 --> 00:31:21,004
Okay. Enjoy your meal.

596
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,720
Where did you go?

597
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:11,019
You're back, boss.

598
00:32:12,383 --> 00:32:14,063
I went to my friend's house.

599
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,745
She needed to talk to me about something.

600
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:16,969
What's wrong?

601
00:32:24,408 --> 00:32:25,522
Boss.

602
00:32:25,753 --> 00:32:27,402
Have you gone to have the meal?

603
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:33,002
I forgot about having a meal with you. I...

604
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:36,410
You didn't reply to my message. I thought you rejected me.

605
00:32:36,598 --> 00:32:38,425
I'm sorry. Did you go?

606
00:32:38,529 --> 00:32:39,662
No.

607
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,838
That's good. Otherwise, I would have made a mistake again.

608
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,680
Boss. Are you hungry now?

609
00:32:47,862 --> 00:32:49,832
Can I treat you to supper?

610
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,682
No need. I have already eaten with the client. I'm very full.

611
00:32:55,912 --> 00:32:57,792
Let's walk to a place to have some supper then.

612
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,890
Maybe you'll get hungry on the way.

613
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,410
I owe you a meal. I don't feel at ease.

614
00:33:06,576 --> 00:33:08,295
Let me treat you to supper.

615
00:33:08,376 --> 00:33:10,602
Otherwise, I won't be able to sleep well tonight.

616
00:33:12,289 --> 00:33:13,489
Are you feeling unwell?

617
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,920
I have a slight headache.

618
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,202
We don't need to have supper. Let's go for a massage.

619
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:21,690
Massage?

620
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:23,682
Although this goes against my usual habits,

621
00:33:23,888 --> 00:33:27,009
if you're not feeling well, it will affect your work,

622
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:29,082
and in turn, affect my work efficiency. Let's go.

623
00:33:38,609 --> 00:33:39,939
Right here.

624
00:33:40,129 --> 00:33:41,329
Press harder.

625
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,450
Right here.

626
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:49,267
Don't make noise.

627
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,320
I have to call out for the masseuse to know where to press.

628
00:33:53,452 --> 00:33:55,820
Madam, right here. You can press harder.

629
00:34:00,355 --> 00:34:01,482
Sir.

630
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:03,899
Your shoulders and neck are so stiff.

631
00:34:04,176 --> 00:34:06,587
Have you been having trouble sleeping lately?

632
00:34:06,866 --> 00:34:08,002
I'm fine.

633
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,399
Boss. You have to let it out.

634
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,960
If you let it out, you can release the stress.

635
00:34:14,041 --> 00:34:15,682
Don't be so reserved.

636
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:17,636
Madam, you can push harder.

637
00:34:17,717 --> 00:34:20,482
- Okay. - I'm talking about him.

638
00:34:21,105 --> 00:34:22,202
Okay.

639
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:29,755
Sir, are you okay?

640
00:34:29,835 --> 00:34:30,882
I'm fine.

641
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,772
Just keep track of the fees.

642
00:34:39,515 --> 00:34:41,810
Boss. Didn't we agree that I would treat you?

643
00:34:41,952 --> 00:34:44,250
This spa is really nice.

644
00:34:44,376 --> 00:34:46,936
Let me tell you. In our hometown, there's nothing of this level.

645
00:34:47,754 --> 00:34:49,866
Today, I'm going to take you to enjoy it to the fullest.

646
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:50,922
Okay.

647
00:34:52,104 --> 00:34:54,127
- Cheng Yao. - Yao Yao.

648
00:34:54,256 --> 00:34:55,802
How did you guys end up here?

649
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,921
Yao Yao. Who is this person?

650
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,462
Sir, I am...

651
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,162
He is Yao Yao's housemate.

652
00:35:07,714 --> 00:35:08,914
Hello.

653
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,289
He looks quite decent.

654
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,689
Why did you bring him to such a high-end place?

655
00:35:24,387 --> 00:35:25,756
Did you pay for him?

656
00:35:26,649 --> 00:35:28,290
You can't spoil him like this.

657
00:35:28,374 --> 00:35:30,122
No one should pay for this.

658
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:32,040
He's so young and already doing massages.

659
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,242
Qian.

660
00:35:35,712 --> 00:35:37,442
Do you have any health problems?

661
00:35:37,591 --> 00:35:39,962
- Sir, I... - Dad, Mom.

662
00:35:40,165 --> 00:35:43,256
We are not here to spend, nor are we here to date.

663
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:48,779
We're here to work.

664
00:35:49,088 --> 00:35:51,162
- Work? - Work. Yes.

665
00:35:52,343 --> 00:35:53,739
Mom, didn't you complain about him not having a job?

666
00:35:53,763 --> 00:35:56,559
So, I asked my boss and got him a job as a masseur here.

667
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,580
Since it was his first day at work, I accompanied him here.

668
00:36:05,376 --> 00:36:06,459
You want some massages, right?

669
00:36:06,483 --> 00:36:08,322
The front desk is over there. Let's go, Dad.

670
00:36:08,673 --> 00:36:10,336
Let's go, Mom. Come on. It's right over there.

671
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,579
Massages are relaxing. Do you want a leg massage or a back massage?

672
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:14,669
Or a neck massage? They have it all here.

673
00:36:16,033 --> 00:36:17,914
- Come on. - How did he end up working here?

674
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:20,642
I'm treating you today. What kind of massage do you want?

675
00:36:22,952 --> 00:36:25,162
Madam, I specially arranged it for you. Is it okay?

676
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:26,642
It's all right.

677
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,082
Wait. Isn't this my son?

678
00:36:34,593 --> 00:36:36,282
How did he end up here?

679
00:36:36,609 --> 00:36:38,687
Usually, when I invited him to have a massage with me here,

680
00:36:38,711 --> 00:36:40,162
he never wanted it.

681
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:42,449
How did he end up here today?

682
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,930
Is this your son?

683
00:36:44,209 --> 00:36:46,609
I was wondering who this man with such a grand demeanor was.

684
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,840
And, the lady who came with him earlier,

685
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:50,705
is that your daughter-in-law? She's very pretty.

686
00:36:50,729 --> 00:36:51,929
You're really lucky.

687
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,971
Daughter-in-law?

688
00:36:54,529 --> 00:36:55,769
You saw her with your own eyes?

689
00:36:57,656 --> 00:36:59,482
They just finished paying here.

690
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,585
If I knew he was your son, I'd definitely give him a discount.

691
00:37:01,609 --> 00:37:02,682
Okay. Thank you.

692
00:37:02,763 --> 00:37:04,212
Next time, it's on me.

693
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,160
Working here?

694
00:37:30,024 --> 00:37:31,322
(Boss, I'm sorry.)

695
00:37:31,725 --> 00:37:33,762
(I'm taking my parents to a relative's house.)

696
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,121
(Next time, I'll really treat you to a meal.)

697
00:37:37,504 --> 00:37:38,704
(It'll be a feast.)

698
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,440
Whatever.

699
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,842
Hey. Honey.

700
00:38:06,689 --> 00:38:09,289
I have something very important to tell you.

701
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:12,242
I just went to the spa

702
00:38:12,521 --> 00:38:14,162
and you know who I bumped into?

703
00:38:14,495 --> 00:38:16,482
I bumped into our son.

704
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:20,458
And, he was with a girl there.

705
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,800
(Really? That's great.)

706
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:23,819
As long as you're happy, all right?

707
00:38:25,767 --> 00:38:29,807
Honey, what kind of girl do you think

708
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,282
can handle our cold and aloof son?

709
00:38:33,791 --> 00:38:39,362
Could it be that she's just an ordinary and average girl?

710
00:38:39,474 --> 00:38:41,202
I really want to know.

711
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:42,859
It's simple.

712
00:38:44,145 --> 00:38:45,226
It's late today.

713
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:47,002
(You should mark the place first.)

714
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:49,683
Tomorrow morning, I'll have the driver take you there.

715
00:38:49,928 --> 00:38:52,379
Okay. I'm currently following him.

716
00:38:52,568 --> 00:38:53,898
I'm hanging up now.

717
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:55,162
Goodbye.

718
00:39:05,049 --> 00:39:06,460
Stop the car.

719
00:39:26,867 --> 00:39:28,448
Why is it so dark here?

720
00:39:28,529 --> 00:39:29,940
I can't see anything clearly.

721
00:39:33,367 --> 00:39:35,122
Oh my, no wonder.

722
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:38,540
Honey, are you there?

723
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:40,129
Let me tell you.

724
00:39:40,358 --> 00:39:42,660
Our son is truly too kind-hearted.

725
00:39:43,073 --> 00:39:44,883
He's actually willing

726
00:39:45,345 --> 00:39:48,537
to stay in such a place with her just to be with her.

727
00:39:49,047 --> 00:39:51,416
He's really adaptable.

728
00:39:52,728 --> 00:39:54,137
Turn around.

729
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:58,100
But, why can't I see the girl's face?

730
00:40:00,994 --> 00:40:03,769
They're leaving. Okay, wait a moment.

731
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,624
Boss, I really can't eat anymore.

732
00:40:07,751 --> 00:40:09,791
I need to lose weight recently. I've gained weight.

733
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:11,602
Lose weight?

734
00:40:11,724 --> 00:40:13,254
How about jogging with me tonight?

735
00:40:13,892 --> 00:40:15,502
I still have to study the case files.

736
00:40:16,087 --> 00:40:17,816
And, what if we run into my mom again?

737
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:19,629
I can't afford to owe you any more favors.

738
00:40:20,552 --> 00:40:22,032
I didn't say you have to pay me back.

739
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,368
Why don't you decide what to eat tonight first?

740
00:40:37,793 --> 00:40:39,286
Enough. I've had enough.

741
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,400
Oh my god.

742
00:40:45,214 --> 00:40:47,792
She can make our ice-cold son

743
00:40:47,873 --> 00:40:49,379
go grocery shopping with her.

744
00:40:49,529 --> 00:40:52,482
(This little girl is quite capable.)

745
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:54,122
Honey.

746
00:40:54,337 --> 00:40:55,537
You've worked hard.

747
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,482
Why don't you come back and I'll go check. Is that okay?

748
00:40:58,665 --> 00:40:59,865
No.

749
00:41:00,089 --> 00:41:02,020
I'm so bored at home.

750
00:41:02,609 --> 00:41:05,962
I finally got to see my son up close like this.

751
00:41:06,456 --> 00:41:07,656
Besides,

752
00:41:07,985 --> 00:41:10,962
I found it fun to follow him.

753
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,842
I have to keep doing it.

754
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,415
(I have to persevere till the end.)

755
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:17,929
Fine. Honey, don't tire yourself out too much.

756
00:41:41,342 --> 00:41:46,953
(The secret scandal between an arrogant CEO and his little assistant.)

757
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,602
(This title is too common.)

758
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,120
(And, the boss is really just showing concern for his assistant.)

759
00:42:01,502 --> 00:42:03,557
(The arrogant CEO is only pretending to be tough)

760
00:42:03,638 --> 00:42:06,100
(because he hasn't won over his assistant yet.)

761
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,280
(His assistant is currently in the kitchen making a special lunch.)

762
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,502
(So what?)

763
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:27,002
(It only shows that his assistant is still under the tyrant's control.)

764
00:42:27,129 --> 00:42:28,185
(If they're really in love, )

765
00:42:28,209 --> 00:42:30,880
(they should be cooking together in the kitchen.)

766
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,322
Cheng Yao.

767
00:42:59,631 --> 00:43:00,705
Cheng Yao.

768
00:43:03,529 --> 00:43:05,089
- Boss. - I've had enough!

769
00:43:05,169 --> 00:43:07,324
Let me wipe it for you. Boss, I'm sorry.

770
00:43:07,405 --> 00:43:08,929
It's not coming off.

771
00:43:09,034 --> 00:43:10,842
Then, take it off. I'll wash it for you.

772
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:12,210
I'm sorry, I had headphones on

773
00:43:12,282 --> 00:43:13,642
and didn't notice you behind me.

774
00:43:18,889 --> 00:43:20,258
I caught you.
