1
00:01:35,476 --> 00:01:38,679
(My Boss)

2
00:01:40,287 --> 00:01:45,352
(Episode 9: I care for her as a boss, not romantically.)

3
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,180
Wu Jun, cheers.

4
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,002
Cheers.

5
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,197
Yao Yao caused you trouble.

6
00:01:56,278 --> 00:01:58,869
As her elder sister, I apologize to you on her behalf.

7
00:01:59,068 --> 00:02:00,227
No.

8
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,511
Not at all. Don't be sorry.

9
00:02:03,322 --> 00:02:06,562
Let me tell you. This matter wasn't Cheng Yao's fault at all.

10
00:02:06,928 --> 00:02:08,082
She's just too naive,

11
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,850
She is too kind, so she was tricked.

12
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,962
She always reports good news but not bad news.

13
00:02:12,054 --> 00:02:13,615
I can't do anything to help her.

14
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,058
It's okay.

15
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:16,522
You have me.

16
00:02:18,652 --> 00:02:19,810
You can rest assured.

17
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:22,162
Cheng Yao is my subordinate.

18
00:02:22,326 --> 00:02:24,366
I will certainly assist her in resolving this issue

19
00:02:24,431 --> 00:02:26,106
and comforting her emotions.

20
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,580
Thank you.

21
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,442
Cheng Xi.

22
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,322
Do you want to come to Junheng & Co?

23
00:02:37,144 --> 00:02:39,242
Think about it. If you come to Junheng & Co,

24
00:02:39,358 --> 00:02:41,628
you can stay with Cheng Yao every day.

25
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:43,562
She will be more at ease at work.

26
00:02:43,744 --> 00:02:46,264
She will certainly have a smoother journey in her legal career.

27
00:02:47,676 --> 00:02:49,985
It's in her best interest if I don't join Junheng & Co.

28
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,540
Why?

29
00:02:52,157 --> 00:02:54,463
Letting people in the industry know that she is my sister

30
00:02:54,606 --> 00:02:55,930
is not a good thing.

31
00:02:58,905 --> 00:03:00,305
It's all because of that Deng Ming.

32
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:01,499
You can rest assured.

33
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,522
I will definitely avenge you and restore your reputation.

34
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,962
I don't want to mention anything about him now.

35
00:03:09,143 --> 00:03:11,042
My days are peaceful.

36
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,397
And, if the old matters are brought up again,

37
00:03:13,478 --> 00:03:15,202
it will definitely involve Cheng Yao.

38
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,522
You can't let go of him so easily.

39
00:03:18,289 --> 00:03:20,669
I don't want to waste any more of my time

40
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,562
being emotionally entangled because of him.

41
00:03:23,022 --> 00:03:26,522
For me, he is in the past and is a stranger.

42
00:03:32,268 --> 00:03:33,568
Cheng Xi.

43
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,100
Let's have a drink.

44
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,229
Glad you can think this way.

45
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,580
I'll bottom up.

46
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,442
Of course, I'm also afraid that you can't beat him.

47
00:03:50,142 --> 00:03:51,811
I can't beat him?

48
00:03:52,046 --> 00:03:53,082
Me?

49
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,242
I have someone to support me.

50
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,922
Can't Qian Heng beat him either?

51
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:03,841
Actually, we can wait for Yao Yao to become better.

52
00:04:03,922 --> 00:04:05,562
She will definitely avenge me.

53
00:04:05,643 --> 00:04:07,882
Okay, let's wait for Cheng Yao.

54
00:04:08,444 --> 00:04:10,345
Let's dig in. The food served in this restaurant is very delicious.

55
00:04:10,369 --> 00:04:11,402
Okay.

56
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,600
(Deng Ming: Cheng Xi, are you all right?)

57
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,660
What's wrong?

58
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,511
That stranger.

59
00:04:35,765 --> 00:04:36,962
Is it delicious?

60
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:38,631
It's really delicious.

61
00:04:38,716 --> 00:04:39,762
It's tender.

62
00:04:39,887 --> 00:04:41,002
Eat more.

63
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,501
As you can see, your stupid dog is starting to tear the house apart again.

64
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,109
You can tell from its eyes.

65
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,552
It's feeling guilty.

66
00:04:58,013 --> 00:05:00,901
Boss, you can even communicate with dogs through their eyes now.

67
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,602
Its eyes are so stupidly obvious.

68
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,020
I can't ignore them.

69
00:05:09,721 --> 00:05:10,841
Wei Zhen Tian.

70
00:05:10,927 --> 00:05:12,487
You are a genius now.

71
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,882
You can even peel the bananas by yourself.

72
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,664
Do you think I'm not busy enough at the law firm?

73
00:05:18,745 --> 00:05:20,922
So, you want to give me more work at home.

74
00:05:21,728 --> 00:05:23,868
I cook for you every day and let you eat extra.

75
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,419
You have no conscience at all.

76
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,437
All right, stop talking nonsense.

77
00:05:31,461 --> 00:05:32,741
Hurry up and clean up.

78
00:05:52,382 --> 00:05:53,662
(I made her clock in for work, )

79
00:05:53,743 --> 00:05:55,322
(asked her to shred paper for two days)

80
00:05:55,408 --> 00:05:56,808
(and do the cleaning for two days.)

81
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:59,762
(It seems she's even more resistant and unhappy now.)

82
00:06:00,421 --> 00:06:02,082
(I didn't expect)

83
00:06:02,202 --> 00:06:03,495
(someone would actually agree with the saying)

84
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,953
("three treasures in being busy.")

85
00:06:05,248 --> 00:06:08,682
(I thought it was a joke and everyone could tell it was sarcastic.)

86
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:11,491
(I suddenly feel the poster is so foolishly cute.)

87
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:12,872
(What to do?)

88
00:06:13,023 --> 00:06:16,279
(A foolishly cute boss and a poor subordinate.)

89
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,231
(I'm rooting for this couple.)

90
00:06:18,764 --> 00:06:19,785
(No one is curious?)

91
00:06:19,873 --> 00:06:23,442
(Why is a male boss so caring about his female subordinate?)

92
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,602
(Besides love, I can't think of any other explanation.)

93
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,962
You...

94
00:07:11,638 --> 00:07:14,100
Will your mood affect your work?

95
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,400
Most of the time it won't.

96
00:07:16,662 --> 00:07:17,857
Sometimes, it will.

97
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,098
It will then.

98
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,990
It can't be all that.

99
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,000
Change clothes now and go for a night's run.

100
00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:25,362
Now?

101
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,991
For every extra kilometer you run, a day is deducted from probation.

102
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:29,446
I'm waiting for you downstairs.

103
00:07:38,847 --> 00:07:40,648
Boss!

104
00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:41,762
Slow down.

105
00:07:43,848 --> 00:07:46,042
I can't do it. No.

106
00:07:46,271 --> 00:07:47,402
I can't do it.

107
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:49,842
I really can't.

108
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:53,802
Can I take a break?

109
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,030
No.

110
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,863
We've been running for 10 minutes already.

111
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,144
Only 10 minutes.

112
00:07:58,225 --> 00:08:00,334
You do night runs. I don't do night runs.

113
00:08:00,975 --> 00:08:03,933
When I was in college, I almost failed physical education.

114
00:08:04,034 --> 00:08:06,762
Your PE grades were so bad. How did you graduate from college?

115
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,911
Does it matter?

116
00:08:09,473 --> 00:08:11,169
Why don't you let me go back to shredding paper?

117
00:08:11,193 --> 00:08:12,493
I like shredding paper.

118
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,440
So, did running for a while make you feel better?

119
00:08:17,174 --> 00:08:18,933
My mood has been all right.

120
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,238
Of course, it's before the run.

121
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:25,377
Sometimes, you don't have to force yourself.

122
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,759
When people encounter setbacks,

123
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,521
they need some time to get out of it.

124
00:08:29,615 --> 00:08:31,735
You don't have to hide in your room and cry secretly.

125
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,461
Secretly crying in the room?

126
00:08:39,558 --> 00:08:42,882
Do you mean two days ago when I was watching a drama?

127
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,242
- Watching a drama? - Yeah.

128
00:08:47,355 --> 00:08:51,722
So, you heard me crying and thought I was sad and upset.

129
00:08:51,808 --> 00:08:53,762
So, you let me shred papers and run at night

130
00:08:53,861 --> 00:08:55,572
to help me relieve stress?

131
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,602
Boss, I didn't expect you to be so cute.

132
00:09:00,977 --> 00:09:02,082
Nope.

133
00:09:02,495 --> 00:09:03,815
Nothing, then. Just keep running.

134
00:09:03,878 --> 00:09:05,839
Boss, wait a bit more. Rest a bit more.

135
00:09:05,931 --> 00:09:08,210
Rest a bit more, please. I really can't run anymore.

136
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,550
Boss, I haven't finished destressing yet.

137
00:09:17,677 --> 00:09:20,002
But, your actions have been really useful to me.

138
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:22,487
But, there's still one small step left.

139
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,919
Wait a bit more and you'll see the result.

140
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:26,440
What result?

141
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,722
Good question.

142
00:09:28,372 --> 00:09:29,762
You'll know soon.

143
00:09:30,777 --> 00:09:33,122
Magic will happen soon.

144
00:09:55,902 --> 00:09:57,122
Boss, nice?

145
00:10:00,237 --> 00:10:01,322
Boring.

146
00:10:15,647 --> 00:10:17,749
Bai Xing Meng's case

147
00:10:18,102 --> 00:10:20,122
really put me down.

148
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:24,362
But I believe this will pass.

149
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:27,069
The wound will also be healed one day.

150
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,402
Thank you, boss.

151
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:41,879
I'm moved.

152
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:47,013
You don't have to thank me. A bad mood will affect your work.

153
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,630
I don't want to be affected.

154
00:10:53,865 --> 00:10:56,562
Can you give me another chance?

155
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,442
Let me participate in this case again.

156
00:11:01,942 --> 00:11:03,962
I want to make up for this mistake.

157
00:11:04,484 --> 00:11:06,514
I'll not make the same mistake again.

158
00:11:09,745 --> 00:11:11,282
I'm yours after all.

159
00:11:11,448 --> 00:11:12,797
You have to protect me.

160
00:11:44,917 --> 00:11:46,762
Your eyes don't look right.

161
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,501
Eyes don't look right?

162
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,399
Your eyes look wrong.

163
00:11:51,638 --> 00:11:53,028
How do they look wrong?

164
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,922
Your eyes...

165
00:11:55,329 --> 00:11:56,960
They look too much like Wei Zhen Tian's.

166
00:11:57,076 --> 00:11:58,436
I feel uneasy when I look at them.

167
00:11:59,893 --> 00:12:02,762
I'm being honest with you here, yet you said I look like a dog.

168
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,642
I'm going home.

169
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,880
Mom, don't worry.

170
00:12:22,972 --> 00:12:24,729
It's not a major surgery.

171
00:12:24,824 --> 00:12:26,482
And, you have the best doctor.

172
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,270
Everything is going to be good.

173
00:12:28,884 --> 00:12:30,042
Xi.

174
00:12:30,323 --> 00:12:32,248
It's good that you came to see me.

175
00:12:32,406 --> 00:12:33,846
To be honest,

176
00:12:33,927 --> 00:12:35,648
you haven't come to see me in so long.

177
00:12:35,761 --> 00:12:37,242
I thought

178
00:12:38,072 --> 00:12:39,762
you and Ming had a fight.

179
00:12:40,518 --> 00:12:41,599
Mom.

180
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,522
Why do you always think too much?

181
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:46,082
Xi and I are fine.

182
00:12:51,284 --> 00:12:53,199
Mom, I cooked some mung bean soup for you.

183
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,402
Let me pour you some.

184
00:12:55,638 --> 00:12:56,719
Xi, you're so thoughtful.

185
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,230
Right. Drink the soup she cooked.

186
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:02,402
She really knows how to take care of people. Really.

187
00:13:02,593 --> 00:13:04,762
Don't worry, Mom.

188
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,362
Take care.

189
00:13:06,443 --> 00:13:07,833
That's for sure.

190
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,362
Right, Xi?

191
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,522
- Sorry. - What's wrong with you?

192
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:22,148
It's okay. Xi didn't mean it.

193
00:13:22,229 --> 00:13:23,810
I'll just wipe it off in a bit.

194
00:13:24,551 --> 00:13:26,622
Mom, let me pour you some more.

195
00:13:30,374 --> 00:13:31,845
Mung bean soup.

196
00:13:32,383 --> 00:13:33,562
It detoxes

197
00:13:33,721 --> 00:13:36,569
and eliminates all toxins from the body.

198
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,999
Then, you can be healthy.

199
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,642
Okay. Thanks.

200
00:13:46,003 --> 00:13:48,248
Mom, just listen to Xi.

201
00:13:48,354 --> 00:13:50,729
Xi takes your illness seriously.

202
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:52,401
She even looks for folk remedies.

203
00:14:09,737 --> 00:14:11,493
Xi, why are you in such a hurry to go?

204
00:14:11,574 --> 00:14:12,734
Let's have a meal together.

205
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:15,122
- No, I have something to do. - No.

206
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:17,199
I've already booked the restaurant.

207
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,000
I've even prepared the porridge in advance.

208
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,346
There's no audience here. Stop acting.

209
00:14:22,427 --> 00:14:23,962
How long have we been divorced?

210
00:14:24,046 --> 00:14:25,396
What are you doing here?

211
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:28,522
Cheng Xi, no. I'm not acting.

212
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:30,199
Yes, we are divorced now.

213
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,002
But, can't I still care about you?

214
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,322
Besides, it was you who wanted to leave in the first place. Not me.

215
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,562
Of course, garbage should be thrown away.

216
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,642
Would you leave it at home to rot and stink?

217
00:14:41,831 --> 00:14:43,187
No. Fine.

218
00:14:43,268 --> 00:14:45,322
Cheng Xi, I understand.

219
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,640
Fine.

220
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,719
I know you have some misunderstandings about me.

221
00:14:51,743 --> 00:14:53,454
But can I explain it to you?

222
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,721
First of all,

223
00:14:55,025 --> 00:14:57,122
it was her initiative, not mine.

224
00:14:57,417 --> 00:15:00,762
Secondly, all my motives were for the good of us both.

225
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,206
She promised to give us a lot of benefits.

226
00:15:04,292 --> 00:15:06,479
The support of the Law Association and a lot of cases.

227
00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:09,249
These are things we couldn't acquire despite 10 years of hard work.

228
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,559
Right. In the end, I sacrificed a bit.

229
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,482
But, I think the reward was worth it.

230
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,420
Fine. Let's not talk about the past, okay?

231
00:15:27,082 --> 00:15:28,346
Xi,

232
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,762
I want to tell you how I'm feeling right now.

233
00:15:38,498 --> 00:15:39,762
Cheng Xi.

234
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,660
I think I understand.

235
00:15:44,373 --> 00:15:45,962
I feel like you're in my heart.

236
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,922
Really.

237
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,720
Especially when I'm alone, my heart...

238
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,300
I'm fine.

239
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,802
I'm fine.

240
00:15:58,838 --> 00:16:00,138
Let me put it this way.

241
00:16:01,151 --> 00:16:04,242
If you agree to remarry, I can divorce for you.

242
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,070
Deng Ming.

243
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,642
Your acting skills have gotten rusty.

244
00:16:11,931 --> 00:16:13,561
Go home and practice.

245
00:16:18,314 --> 00:16:19,442
Too much?

246
00:16:26,032 --> 00:16:28,472
Xi, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

247
00:16:30,871 --> 00:16:32,171
Yeah, it was a bit too much.

248
00:16:49,082 --> 00:16:51,769
Cheng Xi, it's nothing special.

249
00:16:51,999 --> 00:16:55,395
As for Cheng Yao's cyberbullying case, I've taken care of it.

250
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,760
I've reported all that needed to be reported.

251
00:16:56,784 --> 00:16:58,202
You don't have to worry too much.

252
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:03,242
Thank you. Really, thank you so much.

253
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,679
No problem.

254
00:17:06,783 --> 00:17:08,143
No need to be too polite.

255
00:17:09,426 --> 00:17:12,477
But, if you really want to thank me, you can show it too.

256
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:13,987
How about you treat me to a meal?

257
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,231
This weekend,

258
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,222
come to the Crystal Hotel to find me.

259
00:17:23,207 --> 00:17:24,293
Okay. Wait for me.

260
00:17:24,374 --> 00:17:25,848
I'll be there on time.

261
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:27,202
Okay.

262
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,482
No problem. All right, then that's it.

263
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:30,891
Okay, bye.

264
00:17:34,231 --> 00:17:36,522
Hotel...

265
00:17:36,603 --> 00:17:37,950
It's a hotel again.

266
00:17:38,064 --> 00:17:39,882
I can't forget this time, right?

267
00:17:41,981 --> 00:17:43,842
I can't drink because it makes me forget.

268
00:17:59,236 --> 00:18:01,602
(What floor are you on? I'm in the lobby.)

269
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:07,510
(First floor, kitchen.)

270
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,310
Look out.

271
00:18:30,439 --> 00:18:31,442
Make way.

272
00:18:36,762 --> 00:18:38,291
Young lady, you're quite good at cutting.

273
00:18:38,315 --> 00:18:40,534
- Not bad, right? - Not bad.

274
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,162
You are pretty and efficient.

275
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:46,363
It looks like you're a hard worker.

276
00:18:46,457 --> 00:18:48,177
- Cheng Xi. - You're quite capable.

277
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:49,602
Cheng Xi.

278
00:18:51,492 --> 00:18:52,792
What are you doing?

279
00:18:53,989 --> 00:18:55,299
Peeling potatoes.

280
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,589
You're a lawyer.

281
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,248
Why are you peeling potatoes in the kitchen?

282
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:01,135
Is there something you need? Tell me if you need help.

283
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:02,459
I'll help you out.

284
00:19:03,249 --> 00:19:05,129
You misunderstood. Let me introduce you.

285
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,122
This is my client, Madam Zhong.

286
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,760
She usually works in the kitchen of this hotel.

287
00:19:09,894 --> 00:19:12,720
She needs to peel these potatoes within a certain time

288
00:19:12,801 --> 00:19:14,240
or else she'll lose her wages.

289
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:16,162
So, I came to help her out

290
00:19:16,318 --> 00:19:17,878
while doing a consultation on her case.

291
00:19:18,794 --> 00:19:20,762
Doing consultation on her case. All right.

292
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:24,591
Hello, Madam Zhong. I'm Wu, a friend of Lawyer Cheng.

293
00:19:24,711 --> 00:19:27,049
- Hello, Wu. - Hello.

294
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,780
I'll help you peel the potatoes.

295
00:19:37,178 --> 00:19:38,258
Just in time, I'm free too.

296
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,240
You guys chat. I'll help you peel.

297
00:19:40,321 --> 00:19:42,191
- Come. Give me. - That's not appropriate.

298
00:19:42,272 --> 00:19:43,282
It's okay. Give it to me.

299
00:19:43,363 --> 00:19:45,682
I'm an expert at peeling potatoes.

300
00:19:46,072 --> 00:19:48,762
Wu is really nice.

301
00:19:48,945 --> 00:19:52,202
Much better than my ungrateful son.

302
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:55,722
If he had a conscience,

303
00:19:55,808 --> 00:19:59,240
I wouldn't be doing hard labor in my 60s.

304
00:20:02,925 --> 00:20:05,284
Wu, I'm very grateful for your help in peeling the potatoes.

305
00:20:05,308 --> 00:20:07,090
But, don't peel too thickly.

306
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:09,449
Just peel off a thin layer of skin.

307
00:20:09,529 --> 00:20:10,766
Don't be too wasteful.

308
00:20:10,847 --> 00:20:12,442
We older folks don't like to waste.

309
00:20:12,523 --> 00:20:15,243
If you peel it like this, my boss will criticize me. Understand?

310
00:20:15,324 --> 00:20:17,002
I can't afford to lose this job.

311
00:20:17,102 --> 00:20:18,943
- If my boss... - Madam Zhong.

312
00:20:19,104 --> 00:20:21,602
Does your son keep in touch with you?

313
00:20:22,058 --> 00:20:24,362
He forgot his mother after he got married.

314
00:20:24,464 --> 00:20:28,362
And, he even wanted to cut off ties with me. I wasted 30 years raising him.

315
00:20:30,702 --> 00:20:33,648
Wu, stop for a moment.

316
00:20:33,729 --> 00:20:35,322
Look. You peeled the potatoes so badly.

317
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,279
The potato skin is still stuck on it.

318
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,442
That won't do. You can't do it like this.

319
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:40,758
Look at you.

320
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:44,762
Well dressed but you can't even peel potatoes properly.

321
00:20:44,965 --> 00:20:46,126
If you are like this,

322
00:20:46,223 --> 00:20:49,298
when you get married one day, your wife will suffer.

323
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,759
Madam Zhong, this won't do either.

324
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,082
No wonder your son ran away. You are too controlling.

325
00:20:54,177 --> 00:20:55,687
What did you say?

326
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,000
Madam Zhong.

327
00:20:57,374 --> 00:21:00,200
I believe I understand all your demands.

328
00:21:00,382 --> 00:21:02,570
I'll take care of contacting your son.

329
00:21:02,655 --> 00:21:05,095
I'll definitely give you a satisfactory answer. Is that okay?

330
00:21:07,249 --> 00:21:12,040
Raising a son is not as good as raising a daughter who is considerate.

331
00:21:33,489 --> 00:21:35,002
Your suit is dirty again.

332
00:21:35,077 --> 00:21:36,275
Do you want to take it off for me?

333
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:37,998
I'll take it back and get it washed for you.

334
00:21:38,022 --> 00:21:39,922
No need. I have plenty of clothes.

335
00:21:41,405 --> 00:21:42,602
I'll treat you an orange.

336
00:21:42,736 --> 00:21:45,056
It's from Madam Zhong's own garden. She said it's very sweet.

337
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,162
I'll peel one for you.

338
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:50,746
Oh, yes. You called, saying you were looking for me.

339
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,819
What is it?

340
00:21:55,234 --> 00:21:57,435
That night...

341
00:21:57,601 --> 00:21:58,801
Well,

342
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:00,562
we

343
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:03,162
Had...

344
00:22:05,547 --> 00:22:07,682
It's actually nothing big. It's just...

345
00:22:09,585 --> 00:22:10,598
Do you have time?

346
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:13,039
How about we find a nearby coffee shop and sit for a while?

347
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:15,282
Not now.

348
00:22:15,468 --> 00:22:17,230
I have to meet a client in a bit.

349
00:22:17,702 --> 00:22:19,066
Why don't we go out for dinner some other day?

350
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,602
Sure. Okay.

351
00:22:21,015 --> 00:22:22,039
Try this one.

352
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,439
It's really sweet.

353
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,200
Really? Okay.

354
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,006
I usually don't eat oranges

355
00:22:27,087 --> 00:22:28,887
because I'm really afraid of them being sour.

356
00:22:30,075 --> 00:22:31,375
Let me try one.

357
00:22:35,443 --> 00:22:37,513
How is it? Not too sour?

358
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,469
Such a sweet orange.

359
00:22:42,077 --> 00:22:43,819
It's so sweet. You can keep it for yourself.

360
00:22:43,843 --> 00:22:45,363
No, I said I'm giving it to you.

361
00:22:45,444 --> 00:22:47,009
- Come on. - No need.

362
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,922
Here you go.

363
00:22:54,909 --> 00:22:56,562
The photo looks great.

364
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,950
It's such a waste that I'm a lawyer.

365
00:23:06,703 --> 00:23:08,816
You saw them coming out of the hotel with your own eyes?

366
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,783
Yeah. I saw them clearly.

367
00:23:11,444 --> 00:23:13,439
Uncle, even though I'm sitting in the car,

368
00:23:13,551 --> 00:23:15,471
I can definitely take a clear shot.

369
00:23:15,646 --> 00:23:17,926
Look at the details I captured.

370
00:23:18,175 --> 00:23:19,737
Look how happy they are smiling.

371
00:23:19,827 --> 00:23:23,360
You can tell from these photos that they have a great relationship.

372
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,642
Uncle, are you okay?

373
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,322
I'm fine.

374
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,842
Your aunt has started a new life.

375
00:23:38,358 --> 00:23:39,839
We should part on good terms.

376
00:23:39,959 --> 00:23:41,259
I should bless her.

377
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:43,479
It's okay, you go.

378
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,887
- Then, I'll go first. - Go.

379
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,762
Cheng Xi.

380
00:24:09,969 --> 00:24:12,279
Your second love came quickly.

381
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,376
Qian, I have something to discuss with you.

382
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,681
- I just happen to have something to ask you. - Say it.

383
00:24:28,749 --> 00:24:31,163
Do you have any cases that are simple and have quick payments?

384
00:24:31,187 --> 00:24:32,885
You must be crazy to think I'd give you such a great deal.

385
00:24:32,909 --> 00:24:34,639
- Then, leave. - No, you have to help me.

386
00:24:34,729 --> 00:24:35,976
Otherwise, I won't have any hope.

387
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,120
No worries.

388
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,430
Mrs. Zhang, Mrs. Li, Mrs. Zhao, and Mrs. Chen

389
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:41,061
will give you hope.

390
00:24:42,487 --> 00:24:43,997
They are here looking for you again?

391
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:47,413
Since they couldn't find you, they had to come to me.

392
00:24:47,437 --> 00:24:48,437
You are so capable.

393
00:24:48,518 --> 00:24:50,158
In front of this group of wealthy ladies,

394
00:24:50,329 --> 00:24:51,762
I can only be your backup.

395
00:24:52,202 --> 00:24:54,022
If your complaint rate wasn't high when handling cases,

396
00:24:54,046 --> 00:24:55,256
I wouldn't have to keep them in check.

397
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,306
Stop. If you don't have anything important, you should leave.

398
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,216
No, you haven't heard what I want to discuss with you.

399
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,360
Sit first.

400
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,910
It's important.

401
00:25:02,616 --> 00:25:05,169
After three days and three nights of hard thinking,

402
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,223
I finally figured out how to get Cheng Xi into Junheng & Co.

403
00:25:09,663 --> 00:25:11,762
Isn't Cheng Xi doing legal aid now?

404
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,816
We follow whatever she is doing.

405
00:25:13,976 --> 00:25:15,016
She does legal aid.

406
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:17,886
Junheng & Co will open up a channel for legal aid.

407
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,760
Isn't that a done deal?

408
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,000
This will help us in getting the Golden Scale Award.

409
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:24,762
Wu, I'm warning you not to try to use emotional tactics at work.

410
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,746
Emotional tactics at work are my forte.

411
00:25:26,827 --> 00:25:29,072
Those cases that bring in money are your forte.

412
00:25:29,992 --> 00:25:32,241
Lawyer Qian. Then, I want to ask you.

413
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,240
Aren't you looking for simple cases now just to help Cheng Xiao,

414
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,949
in turn helping me indirectly?

415
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:40,229
Thanks. Think about it.

416
00:25:56,728 --> 00:26:00,738
Cheng Yao, this is a legal aid case sent down by the Legal Aid Center.

417
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:02,366
Can you help me with it?

418
00:26:02,447 --> 00:26:04,076
I'm really too busy lately.

419
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,720
Of course, no problem.

420
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,377
I was just worried I didn't have any cases.

421
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:09,402
- I'll help you. - Cheng Yao, you're so kind.

422
00:26:09,645 --> 00:26:11,922
Wang Lu, you sure know how to boss people around.

423
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,402
Doing legal aid is the duty of every lawyer.

424
00:26:14,534 --> 00:26:16,642
Don't bully Cheng Yao. Take it back.

425
00:26:18,166 --> 00:26:19,202
It's okay.

426
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:33,156
Lawyer Wu.

427
00:26:34,903 --> 00:26:36,022
Cheng Yao.

428
00:26:36,336 --> 00:26:38,562
From now on, don't take on such troublesome cases.

429
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,959
Also, everyone has been feeling quite hard-pressed lately, right?

430
00:26:43,051 --> 00:26:44,411
I can't bear to see you like that.

431
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,122
So, if anyone has a legal aid case in the future,

432
00:26:48,277 --> 00:26:49,282
give it to me.

433
00:26:49,363 --> 00:26:51,409
I'll help everyone settle it. Okay?

434
00:26:51,489 --> 00:26:52,889
Okay, thank you, Lawyer Wu.

435
00:26:52,969 --> 00:26:55,442
Thank you so much, Lawyer Wu.

436
00:26:56,015 --> 00:26:58,035
Lawyer Wu, don't move.

437
00:26:58,777 --> 00:27:00,296
It looks like there's a halo above your head.

438
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,991
All right, stop being so loquacious.

439
00:27:02,348 --> 00:27:03,969
I want you all to work diligently

440
00:27:04,158 --> 00:27:06,050
and increase the efficiency by the end of the year.

441
00:27:06,074 --> 00:27:08,202
So, everyone, remember that.

442
00:27:08,356 --> 00:27:10,507
Thank you, Lawyer Wu.

443
00:27:13,289 --> 00:27:15,440
But, I want to do it.

444
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:36,169
Please enjoy.

445
00:27:36,256 --> 00:27:37,556
Thanks.

446
00:27:39,203 --> 00:27:40,223
Drink.

447
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,600
You said you have something important about your dad to tell me.

448
00:27:50,927 --> 00:27:52,227
What is it?

449
00:27:58,121 --> 00:28:01,042
If you apologize to me for avoiding me before,

450
00:28:01,196 --> 00:28:02,496
then I'll forgive you.

451
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:05,394
Don't go.

452
00:28:05,648 --> 00:28:08,242
I learned it from an idol drama.

453
00:28:08,431 --> 00:28:10,370
If you don't like it, I'll change my style.

454
00:28:18,052 --> 00:28:22,409
Actually, I've noticed my dad has been in a good mood recently.

455
00:28:22,551 --> 00:28:24,224
I don't know what great thing he's experiencing.

456
00:28:24,248 --> 00:28:25,919
So, I'm asking you.

457
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,852
You should ask your dad yourself.

458
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:32,162
He's been really busy lately.

459
00:28:32,368 --> 00:28:34,448
When he's free, he'll call you.

460
00:28:34,832 --> 00:28:38,639
Actually, I haven't seen him for a long time.

461
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,842
And,

462
00:28:40,883 --> 00:28:42,522
he is so cold to me.

463
00:28:46,419 --> 00:28:47,527
But,

464
00:28:47,706 --> 00:28:49,615
my communication with my client is confidential.

465
00:28:49,639 --> 00:28:50,939
I can't tell you.

466
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,442
Understood.

467
00:28:55,563 --> 00:28:58,482
Can you stay with me for a little while?

468
00:28:58,632 --> 00:29:00,122
Just a little while.

469
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,640
- The cake here is really delicious. I just asked... - Dong Min.

470
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:06,482
If there's nothing else, I'll leave first.

471
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,701
Qian Heng.

472
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,987
Are you really not considering me at all?

473
00:29:15,017 --> 00:29:18,482
Are you still mad because I went to find Cheng Yao that day?

474
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,660
It's my fault. I was mad that day.

475
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,431
I can apologize to her.

476
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,260
And,

477
00:29:29,949 --> 00:29:32,162
can you look at me again?

478
00:29:32,327 --> 00:29:34,170
I'm actually quite good-looking.

479
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,695
I'm really, really, really fond of you.

480
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,128
- Not less than her. - Dong Min.

481
00:29:46,909 --> 00:29:47,990
You're still young.

482
00:29:48,082 --> 00:29:51,049
At your age, you shouldn't treat love as the only thing in life.

483
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,106
You should focus on improving yourself to make

484
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:55,167
some breakthroughs in terms of studies and career.

485
00:29:57,326 --> 00:29:58,442
Sorry.

486
00:30:06,408 --> 00:30:07,442
Bao Rui.

487
00:30:07,615 --> 00:30:09,996
Summarize Dong Shan's cases and place them in my office.

488
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,522
I'll need them soon.

489
00:30:36,698 --> 00:30:37,811
Come in.

490
00:30:37,892 --> 00:30:39,162
Boss, are you looking for me?

491
00:30:39,974 --> 00:30:41,174
Do you have a new case for me?

492
00:30:41,263 --> 00:30:42,702
I'm ready anytime.

493
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,447
What's in your hand? It's so fancy.

494
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,402
This is my notebook.

495
00:30:47,522 --> 00:30:50,162
Don't be fooled by its fancy look. It has many functions.

496
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,639
This is for pens. This is for recording pens.

497
00:30:52,782 --> 00:30:54,582
And, this one can be used for categorization.

498
00:30:56,691 --> 00:30:58,731
The underachieving student has a lot of stationery.

499
00:30:58,922 --> 00:31:00,003
Here.

500
00:31:00,084 --> 00:31:01,404
Take it back and have a look.

501
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,882
Is it really a new case?

502
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:05,862
- Don't you want it? - I do want it!

503
00:31:06,087 --> 00:31:08,882
Boss, this time I will definitely work hard.

504
00:31:09,116 --> 00:31:10,364
The court session is held next week.

505
00:31:10,388 --> 00:31:12,378
The court session is held next week? So soon?

506
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,522
Will I have enough time to prepare?

507
00:31:15,873 --> 00:31:17,134
You don't need to prepare anything.

508
00:31:17,158 --> 00:31:18,478
This is Dong Shan's divorce case.

509
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,880
His demands have already been communicated to the law firm.

510
00:31:22,034 --> 00:31:23,334
Dong Shan?

511
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,322
Isn't he Dong Min's father?

512
00:31:26,477 --> 00:31:27,477
Yes.

513
00:31:27,755 --> 00:31:29,922
Dong Shan proposed divorce because of his illness

514
00:31:30,108 --> 00:31:32,588
and is willing to compensate his ex-wife according to the law.

515
00:31:32,614 --> 00:31:34,261
He doesn't mind giving a little extra money.

516
00:31:34,285 --> 00:31:35,585
He doesn't mind about the money.

517
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,802
It sounds quite simple.

518
00:31:40,278 --> 00:31:41,878
Boss, don't worry.

519
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,520
This time, I will definitely work hard to not let you down.

520
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,880
Cheng Yao, there are no so-called easy or hard cases.

521
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,000
Sometimes, the key to determining the outcome is hidden in the details.

522
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,840
If you don't want to disappoint me,

523
00:31:52,931 --> 00:31:54,368
remember your own words.

524
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,346
The mistakes of the last case must not be repeated.

525
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:58,897
For this case, if any problems arise, you can leave.

526
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,860
Understood.

527
00:32:04,577 --> 00:32:05,694
What are you waiting for?

528
00:32:06,022 --> 00:32:07,202
Hurry up and call the client

529
00:32:07,283 --> 00:32:08,726
to arrange a pre-litigation communication.

530
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,842
Right away.

531
00:32:39,264 --> 00:32:41,002
You and my daughter are about the same age.

532
00:32:41,502 --> 00:32:42,562
Dong Min?

533
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,322
I don't even know where she is now.

534
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,920
My divorce has had a great impact on her.

535
00:32:49,232 --> 00:32:52,362
I only had her after marrying her mother for a long time.

536
00:32:52,623 --> 00:32:55,042
So, we have indeed been spoiling her.

537
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,362
As a result, she can't accept anything

538
00:33:01,678 --> 00:33:03,039
she can't control.

539
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,122
Oh, yeah.

540
00:33:05,046 --> 00:33:08,556
Lawyer Qian asked me to meet you to discuss the litigation plan.

541
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:11,436
This is the joint assets of you and your wife.

542
00:33:11,863 --> 00:33:14,082
This is the proportion that will be divided.

543
00:33:19,294 --> 00:33:20,682
You have been very thorough.

544
00:33:20,831 --> 00:33:22,751
There are some items that I can't even remember.

545
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,922
But, you have organized them all.

546
00:33:25,624 --> 00:33:26,984
This is what we should do.

547
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,520
Take a look. Do you need to add anything?

548
00:33:29,808 --> 00:33:31,726
No, it's perfect.

549
00:33:33,045 --> 00:33:34,467
I was even considering

550
00:33:34,616 --> 00:33:37,096
that I have no objections if I could allocate more to Wen Xiu.

551
00:33:37,144 --> 00:33:39,922
My only request now is to get divorced quickly.

552
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,242
The sooner the better.

553
00:33:41,412 --> 00:33:42,489
Mr. Dong,

554
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,962
are you hiding something?

555
00:33:45,974 --> 00:33:49,362
Don't worry. Everything we talked about today will be kept confidential.

556
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,962
I recently went to the hospital.

557
00:33:55,654 --> 00:33:57,454
The doctor said I had a serious gastric ulcer

558
00:33:57,481 --> 00:33:59,242
and a tendency toward cancer.

559
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:01,511
This kind of thing can't be kept a secret for long.

560
00:34:01,631 --> 00:34:04,293
Once the board of directors finds out, they will definitely push me aside.

561
00:34:04,317 --> 00:34:06,439
I'm divorcing Wen Xiu in order to protect

562
00:34:06,528 --> 00:34:08,168
her assets in the company.

563
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,334
You are really considerate toward her.

564
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,425
Your relationship must be good, right?

565
00:34:14,023 --> 00:34:17,774
But, if your wife finds out that you are already sick,

566
00:34:17,912 --> 00:34:19,909
she might not agree to the divorce.

567
00:34:20,498 --> 00:34:22,858
Wen Xiu and I have been through thick and thin for decades.

568
00:34:22,887 --> 00:34:24,647
She has suffered a lot with me.

569
00:34:25,528 --> 00:34:28,242
I don't know how much time I have left to live.

570
00:34:28,475 --> 00:34:31,882
So, I want to do my best

571
00:34:32,045 --> 00:34:33,514
to pave the way for them

572
00:34:33,694 --> 00:34:35,529
so they can have a stable life.

573
00:34:35,618 --> 00:34:38,562
So, are you determined to divorce?

574
00:34:40,623 --> 00:34:45,002
This is the only way I can think of.

575
00:34:46,357 --> 00:34:47,637
Lawyer Cheng.

576
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:49,519
Do you young people think

577
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,562
that only passionate love is the "eternal god"?

578
00:34:54,326 --> 00:34:57,274
When you reach my age, you might find out

579
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,104
that to love someone

580
00:34:59,584 --> 00:35:02,082
means to be responsible for her for life,

581
00:35:02,795 --> 00:35:06,202
no matter if you are by her side or not.

582
00:35:26,535 --> 00:35:27,845
Cheng Yao, you're back.

583
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,322
Met Dong Shan?

584
00:35:29,668 --> 00:35:30,842
Yes.

585
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:33,479
But, I still feel something is off.

586
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,002
Why do you say so?

587
00:35:35,732 --> 00:35:38,508
He said it was because his gastric ulcer had a tendency to become cancerous

588
00:35:38,532 --> 00:35:40,292
so he chose to divorce.

589
00:35:40,502 --> 00:35:43,302
But even if there is this tendency, it can still be controlled, right?

590
00:35:44,221 --> 00:35:45,342
And,

591
00:35:45,438 --> 00:35:48,562
gastric ulcer can be cured, right?

592
00:35:48,675 --> 00:35:49,836
Yes.

593
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,242
Gastric ulcer?

594
00:35:53,382 --> 00:35:55,255
We can't understand the thoughts of the wealthy.

595
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:57,119
It might not look like a severe illness to us,

596
00:35:57,166 --> 00:35:58,536
but wealthy people value their lives.

597
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,916
It's a big thing for them.

598
00:36:01,023 --> 00:36:03,079
Don't be "once bitten, twice shy".

599
00:36:03,264 --> 00:36:05,034
Dong Shan is our boss's client.

600
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,021
His case is "certified" as safe. No problem.

601
00:36:14,051 --> 00:36:15,130
Lawyer Cheng.

602
00:36:15,228 --> 00:36:17,082
Do you young people think

603
00:36:17,227 --> 00:36:20,762
that only passionate love is the "eternal god"?

604
00:36:21,187 --> 00:36:22,322
When you reach my age,

605
00:36:22,403 --> 00:36:24,802
you might find out that to love someone

606
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,842
means to be responsible for her for life,

607
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,562
no matter if you're by her side or not.

608
00:36:38,437 --> 00:36:40,922
Cheng Yao. Do you want to drink milk tea?

609
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:42,969
Tan Ying said this jasmine tea is the YYDS.

610
00:36:43,072 --> 00:36:44,185
No thanks.

611
00:36:44,892 --> 00:36:46,211
Buy two get one today.

612
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,882
I really not drinking.

613
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:51,131
Then, I'll drink three.

614
00:36:53,553 --> 00:36:55,182
YYDS?

615
00:36:55,895 --> 00:36:57,325
The eternal god?

616
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,402
Isn't that an internet slang used by young people?

617
00:37:02,837 --> 00:37:05,282
How would people of Dong Shan's age know?

618
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:07,838
(Cheng Yao.)

619
00:37:07,956 --> 00:37:09,495
(There aren't so-called easy or hard cases.)

620
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,439
(Sometimes, the key to determining the outcome is hidden in the details.)

621
00:37:26,278 --> 00:37:29,582
(Dong Shan's other properties are all in the city center's golden area)

622
00:37:29,879 --> 00:37:31,799
(with great potential for appreciation.)

623
00:37:31,904 --> 00:37:35,250
(But, this detached villa is in such a remote suburb)

624
00:37:35,495 --> 00:37:38,375
(with inconvenient transportation and not much chance for appreciation.)

625
00:37:39,095 --> 00:37:40,395
(Could it be that...)

626
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,722
Mr. Dong.

627
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,362
Lawyer Cheng, sit.

628
00:38:45,158 --> 00:38:46,879
Lawyer Cheng, you sit first.

629
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,402
I'll go get you a cup of tea.

630
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:51,242
Haven't I told you before?

631
00:38:51,347 --> 00:38:53,042
Now that you're carrying a baby.

632
00:38:53,191 --> 00:38:54,591
If there's anything you need to do,

633
00:38:54,643 --> 00:38:56,203
just leave it to me or the housekeeper.

634
00:38:56,463 --> 00:38:57,763
You don't need to move.

635
00:38:58,326 --> 00:39:00,442
It's okay. I can do it.

636
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,602
Sit.

637
00:39:08,889 --> 00:39:09,962
Sit.

638
00:39:11,024 --> 00:39:12,330
Sorry, Mr. Dong.

639
00:39:12,411 --> 00:39:14,202
I didn't mean to intrude on your privacy.

640
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,122
As your lawyer,

641
00:39:16,218 --> 00:39:19,138
I need to have a more comprehensive understanding of your marital status.

642
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,320
I'm really sorry.

643
00:39:22,166 --> 00:39:25,080
Since you already saw it, I won't hide anything from you.

644
00:39:26,815 --> 00:39:29,842
Actually, Wen Xiu and I are still in a good relationship.

645
00:39:30,362 --> 00:39:31,801
But with all that happened,

646
00:39:31,877 --> 00:39:33,002
considering her temper,

647
00:39:33,083 --> 00:39:34,363
she definitely won't forgive me.

648
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:36,096
So, this marriage will eventually end.

649
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,080
Do you guys need to communicate about it?

650
00:39:38,192 --> 00:39:39,682
How do we communicate?

651
00:39:39,904 --> 00:39:42,562
If we communicate well, why do we need you?

652
00:39:43,071 --> 00:39:45,703
We seek your assistance to ensure an amicable parting.

653
00:39:48,168 --> 00:39:49,468
Understood.

654
00:39:50,331 --> 00:39:53,120
Well, this is your choice. We have no right to interfere.

655
00:39:53,201 --> 00:39:55,002
As your lawyer,

656
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:57,962
we need to assess all possible scenarios before the court hearing.

657
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:01,722
Well, you know that there are many factors to consider in a divorce.

658
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:03,962
If one of the parties is not willing to divorce,

659
00:40:03,986 --> 00:40:07,762
and there are no serious issues like drug use or gambling,

660
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,202
the judge may deny the divorce at the first hearing

661
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,340
if they determine the marriage has not broken down.

662
00:40:13,387 --> 00:40:15,747
Once such a ruling is made, and without any new situation,

663
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,280
the case can only be filed in court again after six months.

664
00:40:19,527 --> 00:40:20,827
Mr. Dong.

665
00:40:21,096 --> 00:40:23,217
I need to know your most real thoughts

666
00:40:23,328 --> 00:40:25,056
so that I can come up with a better plan for you.

667
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:28,136
If you want to reconcile with your wife, we will work for it.

668
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,297
No.

669
00:40:29,535 --> 00:40:30,642
Don't do it.

670
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,960
Of course. If you are determined to divorce,

671
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,576
the strategy will be different.

672
00:40:35,752 --> 00:40:38,002
As your lawyer, you can trust me.

673
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,669
Then, I'll just tell you straight.

674
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,882
Son.

675
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:55,110
The baby that Mei is carrying is my son.

676
00:40:55,281 --> 00:40:59,242
I've spent decades wishing upon the stars for the son I've longed for.

677
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:01,442
I can finally make it up to my ancestors.

678
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,322
I won't let the roots be broken in my hands.

679
00:41:03,504 --> 00:41:05,304
My dad is now 89 years old

680
00:41:05,472 --> 00:41:07,142
and his health isn't good.

681
00:41:07,529 --> 00:41:08,850
I want to give him a surprise

682
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,720
and comfort him after the birth of my son.

683
00:41:11,048 --> 00:41:13,642
So, I must leave this marriage.

684
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,620
I know

685
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,909
you might look down on me

686
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,562
but I really don't have any feelings for Wen Xiu anymore.

687
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,440
I'm not a heartless person.

688
00:41:26,627 --> 00:41:28,135
After decades of mutual support,

689
00:41:28,253 --> 00:41:30,242
I knew I should repay her kindness.

690
00:41:30,469 --> 00:41:32,922
But repaying her kindness isn't love, right?

691
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,320
I thought I could just live like this for the rest of my life.

692
00:41:36,518 --> 00:41:37,719
Now, I have plenty of money

693
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,722
and my body is still quite healthy.

694
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,282
I could just keep living our days peacefully.

695
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,720
It wasn't until I met Mei

696
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:50,762
that I realized days can be lived in such an exciting way.

697
00:41:51,454 --> 00:41:52,736
I'm 58 this year,

698
00:41:52,829 --> 00:41:56,482
but when I'm with Mei, I feel at least 20 years younger.

699
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,640
Mei is my sunshine.

700
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,840
So, no matter what,

701
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:03,096
even if I have all my assets taken away upon divorce,

702
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,855
I have to give them a warm home

703
00:42:06,936 --> 00:42:08,365
before the baby is born.

704
00:42:09,144 --> 00:42:10,944
Have all your assets taken away upon divorce?

705
00:42:11,991 --> 00:42:13,282
Does Mei agree?

706
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,082
Mei, are you okay?

707
00:42:17,111 --> 00:42:19,562
I'm fine. I just broke a cup.

708
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,760
I'll just call the housekeeper to take care of it.

709
00:42:26,954 --> 00:42:30,210
Mei is the kindest girl I've ever met.

710
00:42:30,442 --> 00:42:31,530
When we first got together,

711
00:42:31,611 --> 00:42:33,065
she didn't even know what I did for a living.

712
00:42:33,089 --> 00:42:34,389
That's how we've been...

713
00:42:35,796 --> 00:42:38,962
So, she isn't with me because she wants my money.

714
00:42:40,983 --> 00:42:43,642
Besides, even if I have all my assets taken away upon divorce,

715
00:42:43,743 --> 00:42:46,201
I can still start a business again.

716
00:42:46,282 --> 00:42:47,399
I've done it before.

717
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,562
I, Dong Shan,

718
00:42:50,375 --> 00:42:52,442
will definitely be supported by Mei.

719
00:42:55,879 --> 00:42:57,202
I understand.

720
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,342
We'll try our best to get a divorce from Ms. Jiang as soon as possible.

721
00:43:00,423 --> 00:43:01,425
Of course.

722
00:43:01,506 --> 00:43:04,065
At the same time, we also need to negotiate with Ms. Jiang

723
00:43:04,162 --> 00:43:07,279
to reach an agreement on an assets division plan that satisfies her.

724
00:43:10,645 --> 00:43:13,282
Then, we'll have to rely on you, Lawyer Cheng.

725
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,850
- Come in. - Boss.

726
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,122
As a lawyer, don't show your emotions.

727
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,460
You're right, boss.

728
00:43:27,029 --> 00:43:30,170
Boss. I found out that there's something wrong with Dong Shan's case.

729
00:43:30,436 --> 00:43:32,456
He wants to get a divorce not because he's sick

730
00:43:32,537 --> 00:43:34,912
but that he has a mistress and even has a child.

731
00:43:35,046 --> 00:43:36,766
That's why he's in a hurry to get divorced.
