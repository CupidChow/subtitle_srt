1
00:01:35,585 --> 00:01:38,842
(My Boss)

2
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,293
(Episode 13: Boss, this is the first time I feel that)

3
00:01:42,374 --> 00:01:45,202
(being your assistant lawyer is truly worthwhile.)

4
00:01:55,295 --> 00:01:57,066
- Don't bother.  - Don't move.

5
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:04,122
Does it hurt?

6
00:02:07,832 --> 00:02:09,202
You are my employee.

7
00:02:09,383 --> 00:02:11,172
If you get injured during work,

8
00:02:11,311 --> 00:02:12,962
as the boss, I have to compensate

9
00:02:13,871 --> 00:02:15,822
to avoid potential losses in the future.

10
00:02:16,751 --> 00:02:18,741
So, once I joined Junheng & Co,

11
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:21,701
my bodily tissues are no longer under my control, right?

12
00:02:23,151 --> 00:02:24,451
In theory, yes.

13
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,714
Cheng Yao.

14
00:03:03,795 --> 00:03:05,097
This time, with the complete loss

15
00:03:05,178 --> 00:03:07,300
of the biological father's bodily tissues, we still won the lawsuit.

16
00:03:07,381 --> 00:03:10,021
We can definitely make it to the list of Annual Classic Family Cases.

17
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:12,592
To celebrate, let's have a barbecue this weekend.

18
00:03:12,672 --> 00:03:14,044
I'll treat you. How about that?

19
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,485
I won't go. You guys go ahead.

20
00:03:15,566 --> 00:03:17,316
Cheng Yao, come to my office.

21
00:03:18,711 --> 00:03:19,791
I'm really treating you.

22
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,180
I'm really not going.

23
00:03:23,816 --> 00:03:25,116
Li.

24
00:03:49,392 --> 00:03:52,852
I can tell you the reason I'm taking on Chen Qing Mei's case now.

25
00:03:53,672 --> 00:03:56,782
But, I feel like the answer is not that important to me anymore.

26
00:03:57,174 --> 00:03:59,178
I just don't really like Chen Qing Mei.

27
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:00,981
I also feel a little sorry for Dong Min.

28
00:04:02,038 --> 00:04:04,355
But from now on, I will try my best to control my emotions.

29
00:04:04,436 --> 00:04:06,944
I know that since I have entered this profession,

30
00:04:07,092 --> 00:04:09,342
I shouldn't be so sentimental about what is right or wrong.

31
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,990
You are fighting for justice,

32
00:04:12,992 --> 00:04:14,617
but there is not just one kind of justice.

33
00:04:14,984 --> 00:04:16,946
You only focus on the justice of individual cases,

34
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:20,070
but for the progress of law and the rule of law,

35
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,389
procedural justice is more important than substantive justice

36
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,151
because, sometimes, you don't know

37
00:04:24,232 --> 00:04:25,512
what is true and what is false,

38
00:04:25,592 --> 00:04:27,202
and what is right and what is wrong.

39
00:04:27,414 --> 00:04:28,884
Lawyers are not judges

40
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,160
and are not present at every dispute scene.

41
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:32,922
They are not responsible for determining right and wrong.

42
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,244
Given the imperfect development of the law,

43
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:37,802
there are many times

44
00:04:38,096 --> 00:04:39,760
even if the judge can distinguish right from wrong,

45
00:04:39,885 --> 00:04:41,562
absolute justice is still impossible.

46
00:04:43,112 --> 00:04:44,272
I'll say it again.

47
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,479
For the progress of law and the rule of law,

48
00:04:47,592 --> 00:04:49,722
procedural justice is more important than substantive justice

49
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,525
because it is a visible justice.

50
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:53,892
I know.

51
00:04:54,792 --> 00:04:58,072
I know procedural justice refers to the fairness of the trial process

52
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,760
and the justice concerning legal procedures.

53
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:01,995
But, it is exactly because procedural justice is overly emphasized

54
00:05:02,076 --> 00:05:04,322
that we see mistakes like the judgment in O.J. Simpson's case.

55
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,122
It's because of the justice system

56
00:05:07,276 --> 00:05:09,512
that there are so many bad people escaping legal punishment.

57
00:05:09,635 --> 00:05:12,652
But, it also protects more innocent people who are wrongly accused.

58
00:05:13,831 --> 00:05:16,792
Every case you handle now is upholding procedural justice

59
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:19,082
and making the legal system a little better in this country.

60
00:05:19,271 --> 00:05:22,282
But, we also have the right to choose to represent good people.

61
00:05:22,581 --> 00:05:24,338
Besides, boss, you're so rich.

62
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,012
Why do you always choose controversial cases?

63
00:05:27,912 --> 00:05:30,092
Do you really not care about you being called a "tumor"?

64
00:05:35,992 --> 00:05:38,242
You mean, a "tumor" that only cares about money but not morality?

65
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,048
Cheng Yao.

66
00:05:42,191 --> 00:05:45,482
The law always protects everyone's basic rights and dignity.

67
00:05:45,662 --> 00:05:47,642
No matter good or bad, there's no difference.

68
00:05:48,143 --> 00:05:50,643
Even if they commit a crime, it must be thoroughly investigated

69
00:05:50,724 --> 00:05:53,268
whether there a sympathetic reason for this person's wrongdoing.

70
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,322
For example, a wife who has been subjected to domestic violence

71
00:05:55,385 --> 00:05:58,242
finally kills her husband in anger under the pressure of depression.

72
00:05:58,783 --> 00:06:00,454
For example, self-defense and surrender.

73
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,885
Even for those extremely wicked murderers,

74
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:05,430
they have the right to accept the punishment of the law with dignity.

75
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,323
The law will punish them, but torture for confession is not allowed.

76
00:06:08,424 --> 00:06:09,924
They cannot be tortured to death, even as punishment.

77
00:06:10,028 --> 00:06:11,557
They should be made to clearly understand

78
00:06:11,652 --> 00:06:13,489
why they are being punished,

79
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,590
and have the chance to learn from their mistakes and turn over a new leaf.

80
00:06:17,328 --> 00:06:20,128
The law protects the basic rights and dignity of every person,

81
00:06:20,224 --> 00:06:21,642
even the bad guys,

82
00:06:22,307 --> 00:06:24,842
because the greatest significance of the law is fairness.

83
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:29,402
I will now answer your previous question.

84
00:06:30,472 --> 00:06:33,122
What we uphold is not narrow individual fairness and justice,

85
00:06:33,451 --> 00:06:34,751
but procedural justice.

86
00:06:34,912 --> 00:06:37,661
This is the greatest value of being a lawyer.

87
00:06:44,311 --> 00:06:45,611
Boss.

88
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:47,522
This is the first time I feel that

89
00:06:47,612 --> 00:06:49,562
being your assistant lawyer

90
00:06:50,071 --> 00:06:51,371
is truly worthwhile.

91
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,534
If, in the future, I become a famous lawyer,

92
00:06:54,617 --> 00:06:56,712
I will calculate your consultation fee in hours

93
00:06:56,793 --> 00:06:58,383
and pay accordingly.

94
00:06:59,712 --> 00:07:00,932
No need for consultation fees.

95
00:07:01,013 --> 00:07:02,242
Just do me a favor.

96
00:07:05,472 --> 00:07:06,562
Eat this.

97
00:07:24,286 --> 00:07:26,036
Cilantro-flavored chocolate?

98
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:27,588
Imported, limited edition.

99
00:07:28,311 --> 00:07:29,747
I've always been curious about the taste

100
00:07:29,828 --> 00:07:31,218
but I'm too scared to try it first.

101
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,802
But looking at your expression, I understand.

102
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:05,950
(Becoming famous.)

103
00:08:11,101 --> 00:08:14,094
(Working hard and earning money diligently)

104
00:08:14,175 --> 00:08:16,762
(to repay my boss for his cultivation.)

105
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:34,788
(Cheng Yao, are you crazy?)

106
00:08:34,869 --> 00:08:36,482
(Why are you obsessed with Qian Heng again?)

107
00:08:36,663 --> 00:08:38,442
(Haven't you learned your lesson from before?)

108
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:41,252
Time to work.

109
00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:36,907
What's up? I just fell asleep.

110
00:09:37,263 --> 00:09:38,322
Wu.

111
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:41,121
I still want to talk to you about my friend.

112
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,600
You know, something really coincidental happened.

113
00:09:42,671 --> 00:09:43,872
He's also having trouble sleeping.

114
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:46,703
To him, that friend is quite important.

115
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,882
- He...   - (Tell your friend this.)

116
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,802
Either listen to me obediently

117
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,871
or just block and delete her.

118
00:09:54,047 --> 00:09:56,716
(Which kind guy stays up every night worrying about these trivial matters?)

119
00:09:56,841 --> 00:09:59,199
With his crappy personality, he deserves to have insomnia.

120
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,602
I'm hanging up.

121
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:03,842
I...

122
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,002
I haven't finished yet.

123
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,762
(I don't even know if Qian Heng really sleeps well.)

124
00:10:19,511 --> 00:10:21,941
(Forget it. What does this have to do with me?)

125
00:11:01,712 --> 00:11:04,722
Honey, didn't you just get off work from the police station?

126
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,202
Someone is knocking on the door. Can you go check it out?

127
00:11:08,305 --> 00:11:09,605
Honey!

128
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:13,162
When did you find a husband who works at the police station?

129
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,882
Boss.

130
00:11:16,511 --> 00:11:18,862
Boss, why is it you?

131
00:11:19,197 --> 00:11:21,148
It's 2am. What are you doing here?

132
00:11:22,232 --> 00:11:23,912
I might have dropped a pen here.

133
00:11:23,992 --> 00:11:26,120
I came back to look for it. Can I go in?

134
00:11:26,237 --> 00:11:27,666
Of course you can.

135
00:11:28,109 --> 00:11:29,470
But, it's just a pen.

136
00:11:29,551 --> 00:11:32,308
You can call me, and I'll bring it to the firm.

137
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:34,762
Why bother to make a trip personally?

138
00:11:35,719 --> 00:11:39,282
That pen was given to me by my father when I won my first lawsuit.

139
00:11:41,031 --> 00:11:42,442
It's very important to me.

140
00:11:42,551 --> 00:11:44,999
I'm sorry, boss. I didn't know about your father's...

141
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,511
My father is alive and well.

142
00:12:02,911 --> 00:12:04,262
Have you found it, boss?

143
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:06,526
Not yet.

144
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:08,445
What kind of pen is it?

145
00:12:08,526 --> 00:12:09,826
Let me help you look for it.

146
00:12:10,352 --> 00:12:12,262
Black, made of metal.

147
00:12:14,551 --> 00:12:16,242
After you left, I cleaned the room for you.

148
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:20,262
But, I didn't see the black metal pen you mentioned.

149
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,901
Could it be

150
00:12:23,554 --> 00:12:24,714
somewhere else?

151
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,282
Do you think I'm lying to you?

152
00:12:26,447 --> 00:12:28,282
Of course not. What I mean is,

153
00:12:28,422 --> 00:12:30,390
it's normal for such a small pen

154
00:12:30,536 --> 00:12:33,162
to have been accidentally placed in the wrong spot.

155
00:12:33,741 --> 00:12:35,131
Anyway, I have to find it today.

156
00:12:40,352 --> 00:12:41,471
But boss,

157
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,042
can you take off your sunglasses when you look for it?

158
00:12:44,271 --> 00:12:45,471
It's so dark,

159
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,630
it will affect the search.

160
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:50,462
You take your time. I'll go out.

161
00:13:27,937 --> 00:13:29,237
Have you found it, boss?

162
00:13:30,325 --> 00:13:31,431
Not yet.

163
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:32,811
What should we do?

164
00:13:33,693 --> 00:13:34,773
I don't know what to do.

165
00:13:34,891 --> 00:13:36,922
It's already 3am, and I still haven't found it.

166
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,402
You must be tired from searching for so long.

167
00:13:40,511 --> 00:13:42,181
Yeah, it's really tiring.

168
00:13:43,158 --> 00:13:44,558
I have a meeting tomorrow morning.

169
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:45,998
It's too late to drive safely.

170
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:49,071
I know, boss. That's why I've already arranged a driver for you.

171
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,682
The driver is waiting for you downstairs to make sure you get home safely.

172
00:13:58,312 --> 00:13:59,612
Thank you.

173
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,220
You're welcome.

174
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:28,642
I'm about to start.

175
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,322
Go on.

176
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,311
When I first took over the Dong Shan case,

177
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,719
I underestimated it because I thought it was too simple.

178
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,313
But after this incident, I realized that as a lawyer,

179
00:14:38,394 --> 00:14:39,972
not only do I need to improve my professional skills,

180
00:14:40,053 --> 00:14:41,590
but also have good communication skills.

181
00:14:41,671 --> 00:14:43,431
If I can give people more trust,

182
00:14:43,511 --> 00:14:46,372
then Dong Shan might have told me the truth from the beginning.

183
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:55,407
In Chen Qing Mei's case,

184
00:14:55,488 --> 00:14:57,097
I let my personal emotions affect how I handle the case,

185
00:14:57,183 --> 00:14:59,431
resulting in me neglecting procedural justice, law and morality,

186
00:14:59,527 --> 00:15:01,202
fairness and...

187
00:15:02,145 --> 00:15:03,522
What was it again?

188
00:15:06,386 --> 00:15:07,992
Fairness and justice, and process and substance.

189
00:15:08,072 --> 00:15:09,894
Learning how to balance these relationships in our profession

190
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:12,362
is the main homework of every lawyer.

191
00:15:17,232 --> 00:15:18,543
The language is very sincere

192
00:15:18,624 --> 00:15:21,882
but the tone is a bit harsh.

193
00:15:22,751 --> 00:15:23,951
I don't think so.

194
00:15:24,031 --> 00:15:25,802
Cheng Yao, I think you've spoken well.

195
00:15:25,971 --> 00:15:27,364
Really, admitting mistakes is a good thing

196
00:15:27,445 --> 00:15:29,554
just like what Yu Fei did back then.

197
00:15:29,948 --> 00:15:31,442
- Thank you for that.   - You're welcome.

198
00:15:31,557 --> 00:15:33,565
Not at all. I just realized now

199
00:15:33,646 --> 00:15:35,898
that our boss's intention is thought-provoking.

200
00:15:35,979 --> 00:15:38,079
I will continue to learn from our boss

201
00:15:38,183 --> 00:15:39,483
and be positive.

202
00:15:39,671 --> 00:15:41,962
You did a good job on this case.

203
00:15:45,537 --> 00:15:46,837
As for you...

204
00:15:50,727 --> 00:15:52,438
Cheng Yao, don't be discouraged.

205
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:54,301
For the 13 assistants before,

206
00:15:54,622 --> 00:15:56,051
our boss has only one word for them.

207
00:15:57,631 --> 00:15:59,082
But for you, it's...

208
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:16,051
Both of you, get out.

209
00:16:25,207 --> 00:16:26,311
Boss.

210
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:27,883
Have you found your pen?

211
00:16:33,386 --> 00:16:34,562
That's good.

212
00:16:34,918 --> 00:16:36,522
If there's nothing else, I'll go out too.

213
00:16:44,246 --> 00:16:46,275
Oh, boss. Why have you been wearing your glasses...

214
00:16:51,217 --> 00:16:53,971
I didn't stay up late. It's not because of insomnia.

215
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,760
Why did you come at 2am?

216
00:16:59,872 --> 00:17:01,552
I think I left my pen here.

217
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,659
Do you want to take off your sunglasses and look for it?

218
00:17:06,111 --> 00:17:07,411
Boss, how about you...

219
00:17:08,992 --> 00:17:10,292
How about...

220
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,260
You...

221
00:17:14,431 --> 00:17:16,842
- Boss, how about you...   - Shut up.

222
00:17:18,473 --> 00:17:19,682
You finish what you were saying.

223
00:17:33,193 --> 00:17:35,663
When will you give me my bonus?

224
00:17:38,271 --> 00:17:40,042
You stuttered just to tell me about this?

225
00:17:41,442 --> 00:17:42,762
Boss, I...

226
00:17:42,872 --> 00:17:44,522
I need it urgently.

227
00:17:54,632 --> 00:17:58,322
(I can't just tell you to move back in front of Bao.)

228
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:01,839
Today, I'll treat everyone.

229
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,522
Feel free to eat, especially Bao.

230
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:08,802
In theory, I must treat everyone.

231
00:18:08,982 --> 00:18:12,545
But, this is the first case we won with Cheng Yao in our firm.

232
00:18:12,671 --> 00:18:14,842
So, Cheng Yao must properly treat us for this celebration.

233
00:18:14,992 --> 00:18:16,122
Let's...

234
00:18:16,615 --> 00:18:17,728
- Have some pizza!   - Come on.

235
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,842
Come on.

236
00:18:18,953 --> 00:18:22,842
Here's to Cheng Yao's future victories in our firm!

237
00:18:22,923 --> 00:18:24,223
Cheers!

238
00:18:27,392 --> 00:18:28,399
Delicious.

239
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,780
So good!

240
00:18:31,885 --> 00:18:33,316
Speaking of which,

241
00:18:33,556 --> 00:18:36,528
I definitely want to stand on the side of justice.

242
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:37,709
But there's no way.

243
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:40,301
Our boss took on the case, and I had to help him win.

244
00:18:40,751 --> 00:18:43,602
Otherwise, I would never lower my noble head,

245
00:18:44,311 --> 00:18:46,122
trample on my pure soul,

246
00:18:46,263 --> 00:18:48,174
and taint...

247
00:18:49,031 --> 00:18:50,912
Oh, the phone is ringing. What a coincidence.

248
00:18:50,992 --> 00:18:52,292
I'll take the call.

249
00:18:56,992 --> 00:18:59,162
- What's wrong?   - I've heard about it.

250
00:18:59,428 --> 00:19:01,112
You are the first among the 14 assistants

251
00:19:01,272 --> 00:19:04,213
to make Lawyer Qian have that expression with your questions.

252
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,830
What kind of expression?

253
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,212
The expression of constipation.

254
00:19:09,912 --> 00:19:11,799
Because Lawyer Qian always takes the initiative to give money.

255
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,120
But, you are the first one to ask him for money.

256
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,551
Of course he'd have that expression.

257
00:19:16,243 --> 00:19:17,543
Oh my god.

258
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,962
Do you know what happened?

259
00:19:20,122 --> 00:19:22,142
- What happened?   - Chen Qing Mei just gave birth.

260
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,855
Wasn't her due date still a month away?

261
00:19:24,952 --> 00:19:26,252
How did she give birth?

262
00:19:26,943 --> 00:19:28,560
On her way home, Chen Qing Mei fell and hurt herself,

263
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,920
leading to premature birth.

264
00:19:30,057 --> 00:19:32,320
She preferred a natural birth to avoid stomach scars.

265
00:19:32,392 --> 00:19:34,802
After the test results came out, she was in a great mood.

266
00:19:34,935 --> 00:19:36,800
She didn't control her diet, and the baby was too big.

267
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,272
She struggled during delivery.

268
00:19:38,353 --> 00:19:39,882
At that point, they couldn't switch to a C-section.

269
00:19:40,778 --> 00:19:41,982
The baby was born with a lack of oxygen

270
00:19:42,063 --> 00:19:43,622
and seemed to have inhaled some amniotic fluid.

271
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,562
Is the baby still alive?

272
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,541
If the child is not alive, Chen Qing Mei won't get a penny.

273
00:19:49,751 --> 00:19:51,051
He's still alive

274
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,082
but he suffered from a lack of oxygen during a difficult birth

275
00:19:53,488 --> 00:19:54,788
and can't suck milk on his own.

276
00:19:54,992 --> 00:19:56,322
He was just diagnosed with cerebral palsy.

277
00:20:03,271 --> 00:20:04,571
It's Grandpa Dong.

278
00:20:05,551 --> 00:20:06,902
Lawyer Cheng,

279
00:20:07,758 --> 00:20:09,508
I regret it.

280
00:20:10,107 --> 00:20:14,182
Help me withdraw the kinship test.

281
00:20:15,071 --> 00:20:16,902
I don't want to recognize this grandson.

282
00:20:17,472 --> 00:20:19,511
I have Min, and that's enough for me.

283
00:20:19,653 --> 00:20:21,802
But, the verdict has already been announced.

284
00:20:22,276 --> 00:20:24,119
The child in Chen Qing Mei's belly

285
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,520
is related to you by blood. This is a fact.

286
00:20:26,654 --> 00:20:30,202
If I had known that the child would have problems when born,

287
00:20:30,632 --> 00:20:34,262
I would never agree to do any testing.

288
00:20:34,591 --> 00:20:37,152
Now, Wen Xiu and Min

289
00:20:37,326 --> 00:20:39,202
don't come to see me anymore.

290
00:20:39,751 --> 00:20:43,352
I heard that Wen Xiu is taking Min abroad

291
00:20:43,587 --> 00:20:45,536
and will never see me again.

292
00:20:46,192 --> 00:20:48,991
Lawyer Cheng, don't you know Min?

293
00:20:49,154 --> 00:20:50,693
Can you please talk to her on my behalf?

294
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:52,553
I'll give her all of the assets.

295
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:54,082
I don't want anything.

296
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:55,921
Mr. Dong.

297
00:20:56,764 --> 00:20:59,510
About Madam Jiang and Dong Min, what they cared about has never been money.

298
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:05,069
Don't you know what truly makes them upset and want to leave?

299
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:11,394
Do you know?

300
00:21:11,475 --> 00:21:13,230
Grandpa Dong is causing a scene with us

301
00:21:13,341 --> 00:21:14,750
while also causing trouble for Chen Qing Mei.

302
00:21:14,897 --> 00:21:17,882
Chen Qing Mei's health hasn't fully recovered since childbirth.

303
00:21:17,998 --> 00:21:19,622
I heard she has a high fever now.

304
00:21:20,551 --> 00:21:21,632
What about the child?

305
00:21:21,712 --> 00:21:22,951
Yes, the child.

306
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,271
The child can't die.

307
00:21:24,412 --> 00:21:26,792
If the child dies, who will inherit the inheritance?

308
00:21:26,895 --> 00:21:28,042
Chen Qing Mei.

309
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,387
Will Grandpa Dong be willing to do that?

310
00:21:29,467 --> 00:21:31,958
Grandpa Dong now has someone watching Chen Qing Mei closely,

311
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:34,858
fearing she might harm the child for financial gain.

312
00:21:35,368 --> 00:21:38,851
Cheng Qing Mei has a young boyfriend, right?

313
00:21:39,472 --> 00:21:41,122
Grandpa Dong hired someone to beat and scare him away.

314
00:21:42,872 --> 00:21:45,482
For this inheritance, she sacrificed her whole life.

315
00:21:45,563 --> 00:21:47,830
Did Chen Qing Mei envision this as her destiny?

316
00:21:47,911 --> 00:21:49,211
Who could have predicted this?

317
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:51,091
Where's Cheng Yao?

318
00:21:53,031 --> 00:21:54,331
She...

319
00:21:57,686 --> 00:21:58,909
Grandpa Dong went to her for comfort.

320
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:01,282
I'm sure she's not in a good mood lately.

321
00:22:01,402 --> 00:22:03,511
I told her to finish her work and then go rest.

322
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:06,480
After all, she's a young lawyer, unlike us...

323
00:22:06,572 --> 00:22:08,122
What do you want to say?

324
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:11,162
Actually...

325
00:22:11,551 --> 00:22:14,542
Oh, right. In Tang Bing's case,

326
00:22:14,652 --> 00:22:17,522
he has signed the agency contract and wants to meet with you.

327
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:18,882
Is that okay?

328
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,080
- Yes.   - Then, I'll book the tickets.

329
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:23,439
Two business class tickets.

330
00:22:23,543 --> 00:22:25,882
Two business class tickets.

331
00:22:28,511 --> 00:22:29,962
Wait. Boss.

332
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,212
That's not good.

333
00:22:32,615 --> 00:22:34,454
Your favoritism toward me is already very obvious.

334
00:22:34,601 --> 00:22:36,322
It's even a bit shameless now.

335
00:22:36,463 --> 00:22:38,162
Others will be jealous when they see it.

336
00:22:38,389 --> 00:22:40,002
Actually, as an assistant lawyer,

337
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:41,462
economy class is enough for me.

338
00:22:42,704 --> 00:22:43,904
I forgot about you.

339
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:45,742
It's okay. You don't have to go.

340
00:22:50,992 --> 00:22:53,322
Two business class tickets?

341
00:22:57,511 --> 00:22:58,642
I'm jealous.

342
00:23:15,862 --> 00:23:17,760
- Hey, Mom.   - (Yao Yao.)

343
00:23:17,831 --> 00:23:21,207
(Let me tell you. Your dad and I will come to see you next week.)

344
00:23:21,288 --> 00:23:23,677
(We plan to stay with you for a few days.)

345
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,322
Okay. Then, let me know when you arrive.

346
00:23:32,672 --> 00:23:34,402
It's good that the boss moved out.

347
00:23:35,058 --> 00:23:36,184
If they encounter each other,

348
00:23:36,265 --> 00:23:37,642
I don't know what kind of tricks they'll pull.

349
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:40,311
Cheng Yao is my employee.

350
00:23:40,415 --> 00:23:41,962
You have no right to say she's incompetent.

351
00:23:42,152 --> 00:23:43,642
Don't try any sneaky moves.

352
00:23:47,753 --> 00:23:49,919
In my villa, there are a few rare edition records.

353
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,040
I'll give them to you.

354
00:23:51,111 --> 00:23:52,879
I don't even have a decent record player.

355
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,722
If you give me, it'll just go to waste.

356
00:23:54,813 --> 00:23:57,024
If you like it, it's not a waste.

357
00:23:57,271 --> 00:23:59,962
(Since he doesn't like me, why is he still so good to me?)

358
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:01,882
(Forget it. Don't think about it.)

359
00:24:15,656 --> 00:24:17,327
Boss, why are you here?

360
00:24:18,031 --> 00:24:19,191
Can I come in?

361
00:24:19,287 --> 00:24:20,322
Yes.

362
00:24:25,218 --> 00:24:26,480
I heard

363
00:24:26,686 --> 00:24:28,996
that Grandpa Dong asked you to meet him.

364
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:32,926
He said he wanted to withdraw the results of the kinship test.

365
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:35,471
I can understand that.

366
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:38,581
His long-awaited grandson suddenly has a physical defect.

367
00:24:47,178 --> 00:24:49,471
Boss, don't worry. He didn't give me a hard time.

368
00:24:49,623 --> 00:24:50,792
And as a lawyer,

369
00:24:50,887 --> 00:24:52,997
it's normal to encounter these problems.

370
00:24:55,071 --> 00:24:56,371
You're able to think positively.

371
00:24:57,353 --> 00:24:58,762
Thank you for caring about me, boss.

372
00:24:59,152 --> 00:25:00,802
Since you're already here, let me make you a meal.

373
00:25:02,112 --> 00:25:03,412
Don't overthink it.

374
00:25:03,533 --> 00:25:05,002
I just came to inform you

375
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,620
that you have a business trip tomorrow. It's a family trust dispute case.

376
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,356
A new case?

377
00:25:10,389 --> 00:25:13,642
But Bao is more familiar with family trusts, right?

378
00:25:14,374 --> 00:25:15,674
He talks too much.

379
00:25:17,221 --> 00:25:19,602
- Yu Fei is more steady.   - He talks too little.

380
00:25:20,455 --> 00:25:22,804
So, you think that I am

381
00:25:22,975 --> 00:25:25,762
professional, presentable,

382
00:25:25,889 --> 00:25:28,692
and even the amount of words I say is just right?

383
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,352
Well, it's not that. It's your self-control that I trust.

384
00:25:32,494 --> 00:25:34,722
We've been living together for so long, and you've been doing well.

385
00:25:36,111 --> 00:25:37,411
Is that all?

386
00:25:39,632 --> 00:25:41,821
Don't I have any other advantage?

387
00:25:44,471 --> 00:25:46,781
Okay. Then, I won't embarrass myself.

388
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,959
It's getting late, boss. Let me send you off.

389
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,951
No need. Go make dinner.

390
00:25:51,952 --> 00:25:53,352
You said it's getting late.

391
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,770
The restaurants are all closed.

392
00:26:15,672 --> 00:26:16,972
You can watch your TV dramas.

393
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:21,301
Aren't you the one who dislikes me watching dramas?

394
00:26:23,337 --> 00:26:25,006
I'm a very open-minded person.

395
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:30,173
(Are you being so kind?)

396
00:26:30,696 --> 00:26:32,842
(I bet you just want to watch it yourself.)

397
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,791
(You just think it's good too.)

398
00:26:43,024 --> 00:26:44,978
(Let me scare him a little, so he'll leave earlier.)

399
00:26:48,577 --> 00:26:49,682
Watch this.

400
00:27:04,152 --> 00:27:07,709
Do you have to watch such terrifying and bloody movies while eating?

401
00:27:07,858 --> 00:27:09,042
It's quite scary.

402
00:27:09,157 --> 00:27:10,342
Really?

403
00:27:21,232 --> 00:27:23,182
Boss, how can you still eat

404
00:27:24,271 --> 00:27:25,942
after saying it's so scary?

405
00:27:27,111 --> 00:27:28,411
It's quite scary.

406
00:27:28,831 --> 00:27:30,142
I mean you are quite scary.

407
00:27:30,632 --> 00:27:31,632
I'm sorry.

408
00:27:31,714 --> 00:27:33,433
But, I have a stack of threatening words

409
00:27:33,514 --> 00:27:35,042
that are scarier to read than this.

410
00:27:35,125 --> 00:27:37,225
The bloodiness can bring you nightmares.

411
00:27:37,377 --> 00:27:38,677
Do you want to listen to the stories?

412
00:27:40,311 --> 00:27:41,621
Let's stop watching.

413
00:27:43,831 --> 00:27:45,131
I'm scared.

414
00:27:48,111 --> 00:27:49,411
It's scary.

415
00:27:56,969 --> 00:27:58,910
Are there any new toiletries at home?

416
00:28:01,071 --> 00:28:02,231
I want to stay overnight.

417
00:28:02,311 --> 00:28:03,482
Stay overnight?

418
00:28:03,751 --> 00:28:05,051
This place is close to the airport.

419
00:28:06,297 --> 00:28:08,202
You can refuse. Then, I'll give the case to Yu Fei.

420
00:28:09,031 --> 00:28:10,331
Oh, why would I refuse?

421
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:12,522
It's an honor for you to come back and stay.

422
00:28:12,592 --> 00:28:13,802
And, this is also your home.

423
00:28:14,006 --> 00:28:15,882
I welcome you...

424
00:28:16,791 --> 00:28:18,091
I welcome you warmly.

425
00:28:22,456 --> 00:28:23,695
Let me tell you.

426
00:28:23,791 --> 00:28:25,471
During dinner tonight,

427
00:28:25,639 --> 00:28:27,191
I wanted to play a horror movie

428
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:28,711
to scare Qian Heng.

429
00:28:28,846 --> 00:28:31,186
But, he wasn't scared at all. I was the one who got scared.

430
00:28:31,995 --> 00:28:33,276
I couldn't even finish my meal.

431
00:28:33,365 --> 00:28:36,111
Qian Heng is the type of person that even ghosts are afraid of.

432
00:28:40,551 --> 00:28:43,341
I think you're the one who really scared him.

433
00:28:43,518 --> 00:28:45,578
Look at what you're holding in your hand.

434
00:28:46,751 --> 00:28:48,751
Qian Heng is definitely a sadist.

435
00:28:48,881 --> 00:28:50,902
When did you become a masochist?

436
00:28:51,111 --> 00:28:52,339
Put down the pan.

437
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:55,012
What happened to your courage when you used to argue with clients?

438
00:28:56,255 --> 00:28:58,833
It's always good to be prepared. What if I want to eat too?

439
00:29:02,528 --> 00:29:03,528
But,

440
00:29:03,665 --> 00:29:06,431
do you feel like Qian Heng does have some issues?

441
00:29:06,534 --> 00:29:08,564
You've only handled two cases with him

442
00:29:08,751 --> 00:29:10,061
(and two persons have died.)

443
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:13,167
(Could it be that something unholy is involved?)

444
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,700
No way.

445
00:29:15,232 --> 00:29:17,262
They probably won't be able to find me either.

446
00:29:19,139 --> 00:29:20,592
Is this your first day at work?

447
00:29:20,672 --> 00:29:24,242
Don't you know the role of employees is to protect the boss?

448
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,990
(How about I come over and keep you company tonight?)

449
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,131
(I remember, in the past,)

450
00:29:28,212 --> 00:29:30,562
(you couldn't sleep after watching horror movies.)

451
00:29:33,282 --> 00:29:34,935
Forget it. You're already pregnant.

452
00:29:35,016 --> 00:29:36,316
Don't come here unless it's necessary.

453
00:29:36,417 --> 00:29:38,576
Besides, I haven't done anything wrong.

454
00:29:38,657 --> 00:29:39,957
Why would I be afraid of ghosts?

455
00:29:41,969 --> 00:29:43,889
Let me pack my luggage first. I'm hanging up now.

456
00:29:44,195 --> 00:29:45,665
Go to bed early and get some rest.

457
00:29:46,071 --> 00:29:47,371
Goodbye.

458
00:29:49,591 --> 00:29:50,891
Don't be afraid.

459
00:29:51,311 --> 00:29:52,611
It'll be fine.

460
00:30:08,472 --> 00:30:10,402
Sleeping with the lights on should be okay.

461
00:30:30,872 --> 00:30:33,212
Boss!

462
00:30:33,362 --> 00:30:34,662
Boss!

463
00:30:35,578 --> 00:30:36,778
Boss!

464
00:30:36,998 --> 00:30:38,907
Why are you shouting in the middle of the night?

465
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:41,319
Did you notice the power outage?

466
00:30:41,421 --> 00:30:42,482
So what?

467
00:30:45,031 --> 00:30:46,632
So, does your computer still have battery?

468
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:47,951
Do you need to work?

469
00:30:48,031 --> 00:30:49,072
I can lend you my computer.

470
00:30:49,191 --> 00:30:51,420
- No need.   - Boss.

471
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:53,471
I have a question.

472
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:54,851
What is it?

473
00:30:56,672 --> 00:30:58,581
I'm embarrassed to ask.

474
00:31:03,024 --> 00:31:04,065
Cheng Yao.

475
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,500
I knew I was wrong about you.

476
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,071
You couldn't hold it in anymore. You're finally showing your true colors.

477
00:31:08,152 --> 00:31:09,191
No, boss.

478
00:31:09,271 --> 00:31:10,431
There's no need to say anymore.

479
00:31:10,511 --> 00:31:11,811
Please behave yourself.

480
00:31:12,155 --> 00:31:13,240
I have questions.

481
00:31:13,321 --> 00:31:14,692
I have

482
00:31:15,031 --> 00:31:17,608
questions about the family trust dispute case.

483
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,402
I wanted to ask you about it.

484
00:31:19,608 --> 00:31:20,780
It's too cold in the living room to chat.

485
00:31:20,861 --> 00:31:22,812
Can we chat in your room instead?

486
00:31:23,071 --> 00:31:24,371
Is that okay?

487
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,945
I just want to go in

488
00:31:26,026 --> 00:31:28,442
and ask you a few simple work-related questions. Okay?

489
00:31:28,577 --> 00:31:30,796
I really don't have any ulterior motives toward you.

490
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,872
- The TV drama you recommended has a similar plot.   - What do you mean?

491
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,162
In the drama, the second female lead and the male lead share a room

492
00:31:37,243 --> 00:31:38,562
and she tries to seduce him but fails.

493
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,881
As a result, she becomes hateful

494
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:41,290
and ends up falsely accusing the male lead.

495
00:31:42,031 --> 00:31:43,191
So what?

496
00:31:43,295 --> 00:31:44,602
So, in case you accuse me of

497
00:31:44,683 --> 00:31:46,440
trying to take advantage of you while we share a room,

498
00:31:46,521 --> 00:31:47,762
how can I explain myself?

499
00:31:50,232 --> 00:31:51,711
Even if you really don't like me,

500
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:53,447
you don't have to say such things about me.

501
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:55,375
Do you really think I'm that kind of person?

502
00:31:56,751 --> 00:31:58,051
Forget it. Sorry for disturbing you.

503
00:32:02,185 --> 00:32:03,362
Which aspect?

504
00:32:06,511 --> 00:32:08,002
I'm talking about the family trust dispute case.

505
00:32:08,369 --> 00:32:09,669
Which aspect do you want to know?

506
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,909
Since the Trust Law 2001, the practical use of family trusts

507
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:16,922
has been relatively infrequent, correct?

508
00:32:17,003 --> 00:32:18,202
After my research,

509
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,442
I don't quite understand some of the operations.

510
00:32:20,632 --> 00:32:23,420
For example, the issue of independence of trust property,

511
00:32:23,527 --> 00:32:25,197
as well as transfer and registration issues.

512
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:28,192
There are also issues related to taxes.

513
00:32:28,311 --> 00:32:29,611
I have many, many questions.

514
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,099
Just five minutes.

515
00:32:34,576 --> 00:32:35,803
The issues you just mentioned

516
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,162
are also what I have been researching recently.

517
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,289
They are indeed quite complex.

518
00:32:38,433 --> 00:32:39,983
It's hard to explain in a short time.

519
00:32:41,725 --> 00:32:44,602
How about you come in with me

520
00:32:45,076 --> 00:32:46,440
and we can compare the information I have organized before?

521
00:32:46,534 --> 00:32:48,002
It will be easier to explain this way.

522
00:32:48,511 --> 00:32:49,811
That's great.

523
00:32:50,085 --> 00:32:51,395
Thank you, boss.

524
00:32:52,772 --> 00:32:54,397
Domestic trusts, just like banks require approval

525
00:32:54,553 --> 00:32:57,082
from the Banking Regulatory Commission in order to establish it.

526
00:32:57,272 --> 00:32:58,362
At the same time,

527
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,242
it is also regulated by the Banking Regulatory Commission.

528
00:33:00,357 --> 00:33:02,202
This condition makes it very difficult for domestic trusts

529
00:33:02,283 --> 00:33:03,754
to be established.

530
00:33:04,896 --> 00:33:06,605
Look, Article 11.

531
00:33:06,865 --> 00:33:08,068
Under any one of the following circumstances,

532
00:33:08,149 --> 00:33:09,276
the trust shall be invalid:

533
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,454
The purposes of the trust constitute a violation of laws...

534
00:33:15,071 --> 00:33:17,162
- Are you listening?   - Yes.

535
00:33:19,475 --> 00:33:20,919
- Is everything okay?   - It hurts.

536
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,162
I'm okay.

537
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:25,850
Where's my phone?

538
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:29,932
Where did it go?

539
00:33:30,607 --> 00:33:31,934
Boss, can you help me switch on the phone's light?

540
00:33:32,015 --> 00:33:33,315
I can't find my phone.

541
00:33:34,232 --> 00:33:35,922
Why are you always doing unnecessary stuff?

542
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:44,270
Thank you, boss.

543
00:33:48,298 --> 00:33:49,598
Can you explain this?

544
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,282
(Silly Stinky Boss)

545
00:33:56,071 --> 00:34:00,222
This is a lovely nickname I have for you.

546
00:34:00,345 --> 00:34:01,645
Lovely nickname.

547
00:34:03,544 --> 00:34:04,936
After you see the word "silly,"

548
00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:06,647
do you feel a hint of

549
00:34:06,752 --> 00:34:08,962
sadness, helplessness,

550
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:10,242
and love?

551
00:34:10,432 --> 00:34:11,842
Plus the word "stinky".

552
00:34:11,975 --> 00:34:15,002
Boss, many parents call their children "stinky babies."

553
00:34:15,312 --> 00:34:19,520
How much love is contained in that one word?

554
00:34:19,661 --> 00:34:21,162
Lovely nickname, huh?

555
00:34:21,631 --> 00:34:23,562
Do you also use this nickname for your parents?

556
00:34:25,186 --> 00:34:26,486
Not really.

557
00:34:28,278 --> 00:34:30,522
What about this circle? Can you explain it?

558
00:34:38,693 --> 00:34:42,071
Boss. About the insurance law, I have a question to ask you.

559
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:44,242
- About the inheritance of the family's wealth...   - Go out.

560
00:34:47,564 --> 00:34:49,402
I haven't finished studying yet.

561
00:34:50,104 --> 00:34:51,904
- Leave now.   - Boss.

562
00:34:51,985 --> 00:34:53,959
Boss, can you not cast me out?

563
00:34:54,063 --> 00:34:56,867
Cheng Yao, if you keep doing this, I'll accuse you of sexual harassment.

564
00:34:56,948 --> 00:34:58,686
- Get out.   - Boss.

565
00:34:58,767 --> 00:35:01,327
- Let go.   - I'll tell the truth.

566
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,591
I'm afraid of the dark.

567
00:35:02,671 --> 00:35:04,362
I just watched a horror movie.

568
00:35:04,443 --> 00:35:05,722
And now, the power is out.

569
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:07,378
I'm really scared of being alone.

570
00:35:07,459 --> 00:35:08,712
Can I stay with you for a while?

571
00:35:08,792 --> 00:35:10,142
Please, I beg you.

572
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,180
Let go of my hand.

573
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:18,522
Why would you watch a horror movie if you're afraid of ghosts?

574
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,000
Don't do it again.

575
00:35:23,203 --> 00:35:24,513
Thank you, boss.

576
00:35:45,631 --> 00:35:47,421
Boss, are you still awake?

577
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:55,688
Actually, sometimes, you may be harsh with your words

578
00:35:55,792 --> 00:35:58,501
but you are very caring in critical moments.

579
00:35:59,913 --> 00:36:02,093
If you're not tired, let's chat for a bit.

580
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,660
What do you want to talk about?

581
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:09,810
Just talk about

582
00:36:09,904 --> 00:36:12,202
your feelings and insights since you started working.

583
00:36:12,312 --> 00:36:16,732
Would someone as outstanding as you have faced challenges like us newbies?

584
00:36:22,832 --> 00:36:26,222
How could someone as talented as you face the same struggles as us?

585
00:36:27,156 --> 00:36:28,495
I became a lawyer

586
00:36:28,711 --> 00:36:30,162
despite my family's persistent opposition.

587
00:36:35,647 --> 00:36:38,368
You're planning to go back and inherit the family business, right?

588
00:36:38,526 --> 00:36:40,236
My parents used

589
00:36:40,542 --> 00:36:42,642
comprehensive financial sanctions to force me to comply.

590
00:36:43,671 --> 00:36:44,882
I just wanted to prove myself,

591
00:36:45,016 --> 00:36:46,316
so I resisted them.

592
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:49,951
At that time, I couldn't afford anything to eat

593
00:36:50,031 --> 00:36:51,341
and didn't have time to eat either.

594
00:36:51,472 --> 00:36:52,772
So, I often had stomachaches.

595
00:36:53,671 --> 00:36:55,802
One day, I finally got a case.

596
00:36:56,312 --> 00:36:59,082
I had to run around to communicate and deliver documents

597
00:36:59,327 --> 00:37:02,242
just to retain the lawyer's fee worth 5,000 yuan.

598
00:37:03,456 --> 00:37:07,096
But I remember Bao told me that since you started working,

599
00:37:07,207 --> 00:37:08,998
you have always been very glamorous.

600
00:37:09,792 --> 00:37:11,222
That's because I was pretending.

601
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:13,961
Before my dad imposed financial sanctions on me,

602
00:37:14,049 --> 00:37:15,922
I bought the most expensive suit.

603
00:37:16,127 --> 00:37:18,047
At that time, I could barely afford to live,

604
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:19,949
but I still wore it every day

605
00:37:20,278 --> 00:37:21,722
to be in the most professional

606
00:37:21,912 --> 00:37:24,042
and dedicated manner when facing everyone.

607
00:37:25,191 --> 00:37:29,110
It's a pity my supervising lawyer didn't like me at all.

608
00:37:29,214 --> 00:37:31,844
He thought I was just a rich second-generation

609
00:37:32,168 --> 00:37:33,838
playing the role of a lawyer for fun.

610
00:37:34,551 --> 00:37:36,222
He gave me a hard time every day

611
00:37:36,711 --> 00:37:38,591
causing me to almost lose several lawsuits.

612
00:37:38,748 --> 00:37:41,458
Which law firm is that? How can there be someone like this?

613
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,500
It's a big law firm.

614
00:37:44,671 --> 00:37:46,362
I don't want to mention this anymore.

615
00:37:48,151 --> 00:37:49,702
I had high hopes when I joined

616
00:37:50,392 --> 00:37:53,431
but in the end, I realized that many experienced lawyers

617
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,991
put all their energy into suppressing dissidents and forming cliques

618
00:37:57,177 --> 00:37:59,336
instead of focusing on improving their own professional skills

619
00:37:59,432 --> 00:38:00,732
and business standards.

620
00:38:00,872 --> 00:38:02,182
At that time, I made a vow

621
00:38:02,312 --> 00:38:04,062
that I would rather establish

622
00:38:04,191 --> 00:38:06,631
a boutique law firm

623
00:38:06,818 --> 00:38:10,642
with a team of elites which may be small but has strong unity.

624
00:38:11,066 --> 00:38:12,459
That way, I could help each member

625
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,442
reach their potential in terms of professional abilities.

626
00:38:14,816 --> 00:38:17,046
That's how Junheng & Co which we now know came into being.

627
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:21,198
But boss, how about the lawyer who suppressed you?

628
00:38:21,279 --> 00:38:22,579
What happened to him now?

629
00:38:23,872 --> 00:38:25,172
How can such a person

630
00:38:25,551 --> 00:38:27,526
survive in the fierce competition?

631
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:30,291
It's just that his vision is just too poor.

632
00:38:30,631 --> 00:38:32,901
Exactly. How dare he underestimate you, boss?

633
00:38:33,976 --> 00:38:35,257
Boss, for someone like you,

634
00:38:35,392 --> 00:38:36,625
anyone with a discerning eye

635
00:38:36,706 --> 00:38:38,802
can see that one day you will shine and make a name for oneself.

636
00:38:39,455 --> 00:38:40,845
It's not because of that.

637
00:38:41,551 --> 00:38:43,111
With my eloquence and demeanor,

638
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,511
he actually thought I was just a regular rich second generation.

639
00:38:45,849 --> 00:38:47,442
I was so angry at the time.

640
00:38:48,111 --> 00:38:49,411
At that time...

641
00:38:55,551 --> 00:38:56,712
I'm sorry.

642
00:38:56,893 --> 00:38:59,002
My stomach is growling at the wrong time.

643
00:39:02,172 --> 00:39:03,195
It's okay.

644
00:39:04,082 --> 00:39:05,282
I'm actually hungry too.

645
00:39:05,477 --> 00:39:06,777
Let's get some supper.

646
00:39:07,352 --> 00:39:08,652
No singing allowed.

647
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,100
Why are you looking at me?

648
00:39:28,264 --> 00:39:29,344
Boss.

649
00:39:29,425 --> 00:39:32,055
I used to think you were perfect like a mannequin.

650
00:39:32,343 --> 00:39:33,682
I didn't expect that you would

651
00:39:33,776 --> 00:39:35,656
experience so many setbacks and troubles just like me.

652
00:39:35,752 --> 00:39:37,052
Just like you?

653
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,642
I don't think we're very similar.

654
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,232
No. Actually, in terms of our experiences,

655
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,612
we're actually quite similar.

656
00:39:43,133 --> 00:39:45,843
I used to work at a law firm with a salary of only 2,000 yuan.

657
00:39:46,392 --> 00:39:49,431
My parents often had to give me some living expenses.

658
00:39:49,573 --> 00:39:51,443
It's actually quite embarrassing.

659
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:58,002
But, what hit me the most

660
00:39:58,083 --> 00:40:00,032
is not being able to see a future there.

661
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,110
For a period of time, I didn't even want to be a lawyer anymore.

662
00:40:03,256 --> 00:40:05,166
I would often go home and cry alone.

663
00:40:07,551 --> 00:40:09,922
Let me tell you, my ex-supervising lawyer

664
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,331
only assigned me administrative tasks.

665
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,722
He only let me handle superficial tasks.

666
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,182
I was never allowed to attend important meetings.

667
00:40:17,392 --> 00:40:19,901
He only made me do trivial things.

668
00:40:20,071 --> 00:40:22,151
For example, giving gifts to his wife,

669
00:40:22,232 --> 00:40:24,023
running errands, printing documents, and so on.

670
00:40:26,472 --> 00:40:28,511
However, there is one thing

671
00:40:28,591 --> 00:40:30,322
that he was particularly concerned about us.

672
00:40:30,479 --> 00:40:33,232
When having meals with male clients, he always brought us along

673
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,790
and made us drink with them

674
00:40:35,352 --> 00:40:38,781
while listening to their jokes which made us uncomfortable.

675
00:40:39,071 --> 00:40:41,292
Are you stupid? Couldn't you refuse?

676
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:43,082
Are you a hostess or a lawyer?

677
00:40:45,065 --> 00:40:46,682
- What's his name?   - Yao Feng.

678
00:40:46,792 --> 00:40:47,912
What is his area of expertise?

679
00:40:48,007 --> 00:40:49,307
Inheritance law.

680
00:40:49,832 --> 00:40:50,922
What's wrong?

681
00:40:53,423 --> 00:40:54,589
Nothing.

682
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:57,301
Do you still cry now?

683
00:40:57,915 --> 00:41:00,885
Last time, after the Bai Xing Meng case, I cried once.

684
00:41:00,992 --> 00:41:02,192
After that, I dared not cry anymore

685
00:41:02,272 --> 00:41:03,622
because you said I'm ugly when I cry.

686
00:41:07,425 --> 00:41:09,599
In the first two years of practice, it's like that.

687
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:10,962
Just bear with it.

688
00:41:11,551 --> 00:41:13,471
If you feel any pressure or have any difficulties,

689
00:41:13,551 --> 00:41:14,712
just talk to me.

690
00:41:14,838 --> 00:41:16,937
Or else, Bao Rui and Yu Fei may also help you.

691
00:41:19,408 --> 00:41:22,002
If you can't hold it in, you can cry.

692
00:41:23,417 --> 00:41:24,717
You're not that ugly when you cry.

693
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:29,461
Just don't cry alone.

694
00:41:30,591 --> 00:41:32,482
You can tell me. I'll buy you some chocolate.

695
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:33,873
The normal kind.

696
00:41:34,185 --> 00:41:35,485
Thank you, boss.

697
00:41:36,472 --> 00:41:38,362
But, if I catch you crying alone again,

698
00:41:38,464 --> 00:41:39,802
I'll deduct your year-end bonus.

699
00:41:58,472 --> 00:42:01,722
Boss. Can I ask you one more question before I go to bed?

700
00:42:01,863 --> 00:42:03,253
One last question.

701
00:42:05,151 --> 00:42:06,282
Go ahead.

702
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:10,202
Last time, you said I'm not suitable to be a lawyer. Is that true?

703
00:42:10,831 --> 00:42:12,540
Why do you have to be a lawyer?

704
00:42:13,802 --> 00:42:15,992
I want to help my sister get justice.

705
00:42:19,151 --> 00:42:20,242
Deng Ming?

706
00:42:21,648 --> 00:42:24,322
But, will I ever be able to defeat him?

707
00:42:24,753 --> 00:42:27,322
In the Bai Xing Meng case, he tricked me again.

708
00:42:27,752 --> 00:42:29,461
There's no chance for you to defeat me.

709
00:42:29,645 --> 00:42:31,196
But defeating him? No problem.

710
00:42:31,479 --> 00:42:33,788
Your talent is far inferior to mine.

711
00:42:33,992 --> 00:42:35,542
But your attitude is decent.

712
00:42:35,752 --> 00:42:37,062
You still have a little hope.

713
00:42:38,249 --> 00:42:40,509
So please, boss, help me save myself.

714
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,282
Give yourself two more years.

715
00:42:44,543 --> 00:42:45,682
During these two years,

716
00:42:45,808 --> 00:42:49,428
my only requirement for you is don't get married. Don't fall in love.

Use all your time for work.

718
00:42:53,392 --> 00:42:55,991
Even if you put a high-quality man like you in front of me,

00:42:56,071 --> 00:42:58,562
I will treat him like dirt and never be tempted.

720
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:03,002
- Sleep.   - Good night.
