1
00:01:35,617 --> 00:01:38,802
(My Boss)

2
00:01:39,983 --> 00:01:41,703
(Episode 20)

3
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,945
(If I accept it reluctantly, )

4
00:01:44,094 --> 00:01:46,640
(I guess it's not that bad.)

5
00:01:49,055 --> 00:01:51,245
Cheers!

6
00:02:22,115 --> 00:02:26,065
Guys, I'm going to deliver my winning speech now.

7
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:30,981
First, I would like to thank

8
00:02:31,123 --> 00:02:33,202
my colleagues in Junheng & Co

9
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:36,018
for taking care of me.

10
00:02:36,158 --> 00:02:37,279
Most importantly,

11
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:39,621
I would like to thank

12
00:02:39,863 --> 00:02:42,573
Bao, the barrel of laughs of Glory and Wealth group.

13
00:02:42,936 --> 00:02:45,094
He's been guiding me all along.

14
00:02:45,214 --> 00:02:49,082
And our beautiful, chic, and generous Tan Ying.

15
00:02:49,206 --> 00:02:52,802
And Fei, who took the scolding on my behalf last time.

16
00:02:52,902 --> 00:02:54,812
I'm so happy

17
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,638
to work together with you guys.

18
00:02:56,765 --> 00:02:58,442
- Sensible girl. - Love you.

19
00:03:01,095 --> 00:03:05,002
And my dear boss, Qian Heng.

20
00:03:05,846 --> 00:03:08,525
Do you guys know something? When I first saw him,

21
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:10,518
I thought he wasn't a decent person.

22
00:03:10,615 --> 00:03:13,882
I was wondering why his hourly wage was so high.

23
00:03:15,089 --> 00:03:18,807
But after spending some time with you,

24
00:03:18,888 --> 00:03:20,535
I only realized that you were worth your current wage.

25
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:22,039
I'm willing to pay that much for you.

26
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,442
You can have this.

27
00:03:24,374 --> 00:03:25,454
Boss,

28
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,278
I couldn't grow quickly without your strict guidance.

29
00:03:28,365 --> 00:03:30,356
Cheers. Happy birthday.

30
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,380
Cheng Yao, why are you drinking so much?

31
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,029
It's fine. It's your 30th birthday.

32
00:03:41,109 --> 00:03:42,589
You have to leave your mark behind.

33
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:44,046
It's fine. Your house is dry anyway.

34
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,036
You can walk around and be our humidifier.

35
00:03:46,117 --> 00:03:47,337
Thanks for nothing.

36
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,460
Enough, stop drinking.

37
00:03:51,662 --> 00:03:54,532
Girl, you're playing with fire here.

38
00:03:56,158 --> 00:03:57,378
Is there a fire?

39
00:03:57,501 --> 00:03:59,092
No. Just sit down.

40
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:25,139
(I won't hold it against you since you gave me a present.)

41
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,282
Are you guys happy today?

42
00:04:33,591 --> 00:04:35,711
- Yeah. - Yeah.

43
00:04:35,854 --> 00:04:37,013
On this high note,

44
00:04:37,094 --> 00:04:39,273
I have a question that I don't know if I should ask.

45
00:04:39,495 --> 00:04:41,002
- Just ask away. - All right.

46
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,522
I heard that there was a famous female lawyer...

47
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:44,844
Be careful.

48
00:04:44,925 --> 00:04:46,873
I'm fine. Ask away.

49
00:04:47,046 --> 00:04:48,476
I heard

50
00:04:48,774 --> 00:04:51,440
that there was a famous female lawyer called

51
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:53,642
Liang Yi Ran.

52
00:04:53,982 --> 00:04:56,623
Did she court Lawyer Qian when they were in university?

53
00:04:56,711 --> 00:04:58,871
- Yeah. - Really?

54
00:04:58,951 --> 00:05:00,171
Really?

55
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,979
I told you my source was reliable.

56
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:04,562
I couldn't believe that it was true.

57
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:06,528
Liang Yi Ran is quite beautiful.

58
00:05:06,609 --> 00:05:08,137
Why didn't they get together in the end?

59
00:05:08,161 --> 00:05:09,966
A couple formed by lawyers is pretty cool.

60
00:05:10,075 --> 00:05:11,882
Their children won't need to work.

61
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:15,322
When Liang Yi Ran was courting Qian Heng,

62
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:18,820
she gathered a lot of exam questions.

63
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:21,002
She wanted to ask him

64
00:05:21,365 --> 00:05:22,485
how to solve those questions

65
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:25,082
so that they could spend time with each other.

66
00:05:25,921 --> 00:05:27,322
Lawyer Qian

67
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:30,442
didn't realize her intention at all.

68
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,770
He even told her this:

69
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,177
"These questions are too simple.

70
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,042
It shows the difference between our intelligence.

71
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:41,602
Do not ask me about such simple questions again.

72
00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:43,885
- Go and read more." - It does seem like what he'll do.

73
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:45,129
Yeah.

74
00:05:47,227 --> 00:05:48,482
Any other questions?

75
00:05:49,396 --> 00:05:50,602
I do.

76
00:05:50,692 --> 00:05:52,602
- I have a question. - Go ahead.

77
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:56,362
However, this is a private question for Lawyer Wu.

78
00:05:57,136 --> 00:05:58,642
That's no fun.

79
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,962
Lawyer Wu, were you classmates with Lawyer Qian since young?

80
00:06:04,927 --> 00:06:09,005
If so, do you know that if he has experienced any childhood trauma

81
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:10,636
for him to act in such a way?

82
00:06:11,782 --> 00:06:13,013
You actually know about that?

83
00:06:13,365 --> 00:06:14,585
He told me about it.

84
00:06:14,911 --> 00:06:17,911
But he said he bullied other kids instead.

85
00:06:18,007 --> 00:06:19,527
I think that he was just acting tough.

86
00:06:19,606 --> 00:06:21,555
That's not it. He was speaking the truth.

87
00:06:23,471 --> 00:06:26,439
When Qian Heng was practicing Sanda at a young age,

88
00:06:26,608 --> 00:06:29,362
he couldn't control his strength well.

89
00:06:29,526 --> 00:06:33,242
He accidentally broke the bones of a fat kid who bullied him.

90
00:06:33,523 --> 00:06:37,642
But as to why the other kids wanted to bully him,

91
00:06:37,723 --> 00:06:39,962
I think you know the answer.

92
00:06:40,758 --> 00:06:42,758
You're spending so much time with him.

93
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,256
You spend 30 days a month working under him.

94
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,522
Don't you wish to...

95
00:06:46,758 --> 00:06:47,978
You know?

96
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,922
What were you guys chatting about?

97
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,962
Nothing.

98
00:06:54,742 --> 00:06:56,252
Wu Jun, come here.

99
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,369
- I need to speak with you. - What is it?

100
00:07:01,518 --> 00:07:03,642
All right. That's all for today. He's calling for me.

101
00:07:03,828 --> 00:07:05,442
You guys can head back first.

102
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:08,082
Goodbye, Lawyer Wu.

103
00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:25,710
You told me to come here,

104
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:27,362
but you're keeping quiet.

105
00:07:28,278 --> 00:07:30,522
What do you want? I'll leave if there's nothing else.

106
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:34,932
Fine, I'll talk.

107
00:07:35,237 --> 00:07:37,002
Did something happen to the law firm?

108
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:39,046
Or do you have any PR issues you need me to handle?

109
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,090
- Just tell me about it. - It's not that.

110
00:07:41,763 --> 00:07:43,465
Is it because you didn't have your fill? You want more beer?

111
00:07:43,489 --> 00:07:45,842
- Fine. - I'll be honest with you.

112
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,062
As my business partner, you have to keep a safe distance

113
00:07:49,086 --> 00:07:50,306
from our employees.

114
00:07:50,984 --> 00:07:53,722
- Huh? - Especially from our female employees.

115
00:07:54,143 --> 00:07:56,106
You should mind your conduct when you speak with them

116
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,650
so that people won't gossip about you.

117
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,910
When did I not mind my conduct when speaking to female employees?

118
00:08:00,997 --> 00:08:02,833
Who's gossiping about me?

119
00:08:02,921 --> 00:08:04,522
I'm just giving you a reminder.

120
00:08:05,487 --> 00:08:07,002
You see, some female subordinates,

121
00:08:09,062 --> 00:08:10,462
they already have people they like.

122
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:15,790
You should drink less in the future.

123
00:08:15,814 --> 00:08:17,178
It'll make you retarded.

124
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,659
Don't you have any questions for me?

125
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,980
I thought your house

126
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,509
was on the same row as Cheng Yao and Bao Rui.

127
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:47,693
Why did you get out of the car early together with me?

128
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,378
Bao Rui is too noisy. I wish to take a breather.

129
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,202
He's noisy indeed.

130
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,842
How will you head home later?

131
00:08:58,369 --> 00:08:59,685
I'm not trying to chase you away.

132
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:01,910
I'm saying that I'll take a walk with you if you like.

133
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,419
The view is amazing.

134
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,260
Taking a walk after a meal is great for our digestion too.

135
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,990
I'm not saying that you're fat.

136
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:11,049
I'm saying that I'm willing to join you in anything.

137
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,538
If you wish to climb the tower, I'll join you.

138
00:09:12,562 --> 00:09:14,103
If you wish to jump into the river, I'll join you too.

139
00:09:14,127 --> 00:09:15,822
Jump into the river? That's too extreme.

140
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:18,522
Why are you so nervous?

141
00:09:18,909 --> 00:09:20,129
Am I?

142
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:21,486
I'm not nervous.

143
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,810
Are you scared of me?

144
00:09:23,869 --> 00:09:26,158
I'm bold enough to jump into the river. I'm not scared of you.

145
00:09:26,182 --> 00:09:27,222
Are you sure?

146
00:09:27,325 --> 00:09:28,402
Yeah.

147
00:09:33,421 --> 00:09:34,562
What about now?

148
00:09:34,968 --> 00:09:36,322
Now, I can't say for sure.

149
00:09:36,805 --> 00:09:38,025
I need reconfirmation.

150
00:09:55,192 --> 00:09:56,412
Now?

151
00:09:56,607 --> 00:09:58,082
Now, I wish to know

152
00:09:58,944 --> 00:10:00,202
if you're scared of me.

153
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,650
Come on, then.

154
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,506
Boss, this is your birthday present.

155
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:43,127
I picked this especially for you.

156
00:10:43,293 --> 00:10:44,562
I hope you like it.

157
00:10:47,348 --> 00:10:49,502
You were pretty bold when you gave me that present.

158
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,780
But when it comes to a face-to-face conversation...

159
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,042
What are you doing here?

160
00:11:20,382 --> 00:11:23,253
Boss, I wish to have a child with you.

161
00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:30,220
Isn't this too quick?

162
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:31,842
I'm not ready yet.

163
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:33,242
You don't like me?

164
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,522
No.

165
00:11:35,438 --> 00:11:36,922
It's not that I don't like you.

166
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:38,449
I...

167
00:12:16,116 --> 00:12:18,162
(Come on, let me sleep.)

168
00:12:30,589 --> 00:12:31,809
One sheep.

169
00:12:32,743 --> 00:12:33,963
Two sheep

170
00:12:34,926 --> 00:12:36,442
Three mutton skewers.

171
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,642
Mutton skewers.

172
00:12:40,201 --> 00:12:41,522
Four sheep.

173
00:12:43,238 --> 00:12:44,602
Five roasted lamb.

174
00:13:21,973 --> 00:13:23,042
Qian Heng.

175
00:13:23,131 --> 00:13:24,834
Do you guys know something? When I first saw him,

176
00:13:24,858 --> 00:13:26,602
I thought he wasn't a decent person.

177
00:13:26,728 --> 00:13:28,209
I'm willing to pay that much for you.

178
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,562
I couldn't grow quickly without your strict guidance.

179
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,666
Cheers. Happy birthday.

180
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:36,122
(Oh no.)

181
00:13:36,468 --> 00:13:38,242
(Why did I do that?)

182
00:13:38,988 --> 00:13:41,320
(Don't tell me I'm going to get sacked tomorrow)

183
00:13:41,401 --> 00:13:43,150
(after stepping into the office?)

184
00:13:49,022 --> 00:13:50,242
Oh no.

185
00:14:30,831 --> 00:14:34,622
(I'm not going to the law firm today.)

186
00:14:39,332 --> 00:14:41,722
(I love you. I want to have a child with you.)

187
00:14:48,962 --> 00:14:51,482
(Wu Jun)

188
00:15:09,396 --> 00:15:12,402
Hello. This is Junheng & Co in Jiangcheng.

189
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,059
Qian.

190
00:15:22,391 --> 00:15:25,271
You're calling me to come here early in the morning after your birthday.

191
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:28,180
Can you be a kind person

192
00:15:28,293 --> 00:15:29,763
for once?

193
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:34,882
Qian, what's with the dark eye circles?

194
00:15:35,077 --> 00:15:37,157
I thought your insomnia was cured. Did it come back?

195
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:39,458
Maybe.

196
00:15:40,278 --> 00:15:42,068
Say, do you think our dreams

197
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,580
are hints of reality?

198
00:15:43,783 --> 00:15:45,562
Qian, it's just insomnia.

199
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:46,896
Did it affect your IQ?

200
00:15:46,984 --> 00:15:48,522
Why are you spouting nonsense now?

201
00:15:48,975 --> 00:15:50,882
- Did you give them a holiday? - No.

202
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,192
I think they're attending the seminar Zhu has arranged.

203
00:15:53,216 --> 00:15:55,565
- I don't know who came up with the idea. - What seminar?

204
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:56,722
A seminar about

205
00:15:57,071 --> 00:16:00,500
how unmarried employees should deal with their relationships at work.

206
00:16:07,414 --> 00:16:08,762
Why are you calling Zhu?

207
00:16:09,638 --> 00:16:12,950
I heard that the guest lecturer was one of the strictest she could find.

208
00:16:13,058 --> 00:16:16,202
She made two female employees cry after telling them off.

209
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:17,882
They had a breakdown at home.

210
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:22,861
(Now, it's 9.10am.)

211
00:16:22,942 --> 00:16:24,642
(Cheng Yao is late.)

212
00:16:34,608 --> 00:16:36,159
Morning, Lawyer Qian and Lawyer Wu.

213
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,122
Morning, Cheng Yao. Did you just arrive?

214
00:16:38,203 --> 00:16:40,543
The seminar is starting. You should hurry.

215
00:16:41,607 --> 00:16:42,687
I'll go now.

216
00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:44,522
No, you mustn't.

217
00:16:45,398 --> 00:16:46,618
But why?

218
00:16:47,347 --> 00:16:49,807
There's a prenuptial agreement you need to alter.

219
00:16:50,351 --> 00:16:51,750
Qian, why are you doing this?

220
00:16:51,831 --> 00:16:54,202
You already told Cheng Yao to do that yesterday.

221
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,419
Why are you giving her all the work?

222
00:16:57,974 --> 00:16:59,654
Cheng Yao, go ahead. I'll back you up.

223
00:16:59,735 --> 00:17:00,955
I'll deal with him.

224
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:02,642
- I... - Zhu said

225
00:17:02,723 --> 00:17:05,603
single employees will have their wages deducted if they don't attend it.

226
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:11,369
She's just attending a seminar. What's the hurry?

227
00:17:14,935 --> 00:17:17,842
If colleagues develop feelings for each other,

228
00:17:18,015 --> 00:17:21,549
no matter how genuine or sweet the relationship is,

229
00:17:21,671 --> 00:17:24,470
it'll all lead to the same issue.

230
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,339
How should you achieve a balance between work and relationship?

231
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,710
During the love bubble,

232
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:32,538
people will place most of their attention on their lovers.

233
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:33,820
Lawyer Qian, you're here.

234
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,619
See if the lecturer I hired is suitable.

235
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,162
- Mistakes might occur during serious cases. - She's fine.

236
00:17:39,534 --> 00:17:41,533
- How long will it last? - Three hours.

237
00:17:41,629 --> 00:17:42,926
We have two and a half hours left.

238
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,499
Don't worry. I'll make our employees desireless.

239
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,562
I'll make them only focus on work.

240
00:17:47,726 --> 00:17:49,326
You see them during work and after work.

241
00:17:49,447 --> 00:17:50,567
You see them 24 hours a day,

242
00:17:50,608 --> 00:17:51,857
day in and day out.

243
00:17:52,006 --> 00:17:53,491
As time passes, passion fades.

244
00:17:53,595 --> 00:17:55,322
The sense of mysteriousness will fade too.

245
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:59,355
At the same time, it might affect your judgment during work.

246
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,218
(She's writing down notes?)

247
00:18:03,304 --> 00:18:04,602
(She just confessed to me yesterday.)

248
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:06,986
(Was she convinced that she should give up on her desires?)

249
00:18:08,014 --> 00:18:10,070
- It's hard to avoid mistakes during work. - Lawyer Qian, here.

250
00:18:10,094 --> 00:18:11,695
And small mistakes might occur.

251
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,962
If there's a conflict between your partner and your colleagues,

252
00:18:15,077 --> 00:18:18,890
your partner will surely want you to side with them.

253
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:22,990
If so, biasness will definitely occur.

254
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,630
This is a huge taboo in the work scene.

255
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:29,379
And, it's detrimental to your development in the sector.

256
00:18:29,494 --> 00:18:31,282
Excuse me. I need to interrupt your session.

257
00:18:33,093 --> 00:18:36,162
I think a couple that's working in the same company

258
00:18:36,614 --> 00:18:38,734
can save time and opportunity costs.

259
00:18:38,822 --> 00:18:40,052
They can shorten their date.

260
00:18:40,146 --> 00:18:43,002
This can provide them with more time to work.

261
00:18:43,112 --> 00:18:44,952
If the couple are colleagues,

262
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,870
they'll understand each other's job scope better.

263
00:18:48,022 --> 00:18:50,442
And, they'll understand each other's work nature better,

264
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,840
enhancing their cooperation.

265
00:18:53,062 --> 00:18:54,492
And, peers

266
00:18:56,054 --> 00:18:57,494
also have more topics to talk about.

267
00:18:58,813 --> 00:19:03,202
Lawyer Qian's view helps me to introduce the next point.

268
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,832
You guys mustn't just focus on

269
00:19:04,913 --> 00:19:07,230
the convenience you see on the surface

270
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:10,442
and neglect the looming threat.

271
00:19:12,141 --> 00:19:14,212
Excuse me, you looked very focused.

272
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,444
Do you mind sharing your thoughts with us?

273
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:20,499
Actually, I've always been serious when it comes to work.

274
00:19:20,602 --> 00:19:23,242
I mean the lady beside you.

275
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,602
She's calling for you.

276
00:19:27,243 --> 00:19:29,202
- She's calling for you. - Yes, you.

277
00:19:33,751 --> 00:19:35,336
Miss, I think you're right.

278
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,206
It's better to avoid having a relationship with your colleagues.

279
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,522
If the relationship goes well,

280
00:19:39,603 --> 00:19:41,625
it'll reduce work efficiency.

281
00:19:41,706 --> 00:19:44,322
If you break up with your colleague, you have to change jobs.

282
00:19:44,403 --> 00:19:46,962
By then, you'll lose both your job and relationship.

283
00:19:47,216 --> 00:19:48,436
It's not worth it.

284
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:50,322
Very good.

285
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,951
Lawyer Qian, we have four more chapters to go.

286
00:19:53,046 --> 00:19:54,277
Why don't you sit down and join us?

287
00:19:54,301 --> 00:19:55,521
No need for that.

288
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,978
I think our employees have good awareness.

289
00:19:58,093 --> 00:19:59,414
This seminar is a success.

290
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,730
We can stop here.

291
00:20:06,781 --> 00:20:08,001
Dismissed.

292
00:20:08,142 --> 00:20:10,162
Miss, I've learned a lot today.

293
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:19,202
It's over already?

294
00:20:19,311 --> 00:20:20,711
Yeah, I thought it was strange too.

295
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:23,436
I thought Lawyer Qian was the one who came up with this idea.

296
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:26,789
And, that girl did well.

297
00:20:26,942 --> 00:20:29,011
But he stopped the seminar after hearing her words.

298
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,819
(This has nothing to do with me, right?)

299
00:20:35,921 --> 00:20:37,588
(Why did my female colleague stop approaching me)

300
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:39,362
(after confessing to me?)

301
00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:43,736
(Isn't it obvious? She's a girl.)

302
00:20:43,845 --> 00:20:45,339
(She's already brave enough to confess to you.)

303
00:20:45,363 --> 00:20:46,803
(What else do you expect her to do?)

304
00:20:50,054 --> 00:20:51,768
(She was the one who started it.)

305
00:20:51,853 --> 00:20:53,373
(Shouldn't she be proactive about it?)

306
00:20:54,566 --> 00:20:57,082
(Brother, are you that dense?)

307
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,442
(Your colleague is shy.)

308
00:20:59,582 --> 00:21:01,202
(Can't you even tell?)

309
00:21:01,298 --> 00:21:04,002
(Speaking of which, what do you look like?)

310
00:21:04,115 --> 00:21:05,785
(Can you send us a selfie?)

311
00:21:05,926 --> 00:21:08,955
(I'm curious as to why your female colleague confessed to you.)

312
00:21:10,401 --> 00:21:11,722
(I won't.)

313
00:21:13,631 --> 00:21:15,842
(Maybe it's because he's too ugly.)

314
00:21:21,766 --> 00:21:23,726
(Could it be that she's playing hard-to-get?)

315
00:21:23,879 --> 00:21:25,517
(First, she stirs up his interest.)

316
00:21:25,605 --> 00:21:27,122
(After that, she ignores him, )

317
00:21:27,212 --> 00:21:28,963
(forcing him to speak to her.)

318
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:35,655
(So, should I remain still)

319
00:21:35,736 --> 00:21:37,442
(and see who's more determined?)

320
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:42,682
(That's right. Not just that, )

321
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:45,562
(you have to make it as if you're not interested in her.)

322
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,882
(Only then she'll panic)

323
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,522
(and approach you sooner.)

324
00:21:56,463 --> 00:21:57,522
Boss.

325
00:22:01,423 --> 00:22:03,162
I made coffee for you.

326
00:22:10,236 --> 00:22:13,055
You don't even knock on my door before coming in now, huh?

327
00:22:13,487 --> 00:22:14,566
I did.

328
00:22:14,686 --> 00:22:16,042
Did you not hear me?

329
00:22:23,495 --> 00:22:24,715
Boss?

330
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:29,002
Boss, are you unwell?

331
00:22:29,517 --> 00:22:31,026
Are you stressed out?

332
00:22:32,265 --> 00:22:36,656
What about this? Let's have the farewell dinner tonight.

333
00:22:36,877 --> 00:22:38,867
I have something to tell you as well.

334
00:22:40,444 --> 00:22:42,402
(She's finally going to confess to me.)

335
00:22:43,042 --> 00:22:45,002
(The netizens are right somehow.)

336
00:22:45,441 --> 00:22:47,881
(She's asking me out when I'm showing her the cold shoulder.)

337
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,682
I guess I can have dinner with you.

338
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:56,162
Actually, the atmosphere matters a lot.

339
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,640
Should we find an excellent restaurant?

340
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:03,619
Huh? We need to care about the atmosphere when we're discussing cases?

341
00:23:04,909 --> 00:23:06,709
Are you only going to discuss a case with me?

342
00:23:07,606 --> 00:23:08,966
It's Meng Ting's case.

343
00:23:09,109 --> 00:23:11,562
We wish to gather evidence of Zhang Hao's affair.

344
00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:15,111
But now, informal evidence-gathering techniques are illegal.

345
00:23:15,192 --> 00:23:17,783
Boss, that's why I wish to ask you if there's a better solution.

346
00:23:17,876 --> 00:23:20,507
The law firm pays you to come up with solutions.

347
00:23:21,639 --> 00:23:23,162
You didn't have to be this fierce.

348
00:23:23,703 --> 00:23:25,223
I'll think of a solution myself, then.

349
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:28,502
Sorry for bothering you.

350
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:37,522
She actually said that?

351
00:23:43,483 --> 00:23:45,764
Cheng Xi, why did you move to a new unit all of a sudden?

352
00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:51,042
The interior is pretty nice.

353
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,242
Your room is over there.

354
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:02,678
There's one issue. This place is too remote.

355
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,110
I can't reach this place by taking the subway.

356
00:24:04,134 --> 00:24:06,246
I just wanted to have a change of environment and mood.

357
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,322
What's wrong?

358
00:24:07,645 --> 00:24:08,916
Change of mood?

359
00:24:09,589 --> 00:24:10,809
What happened?

360
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,627
Nothing.

361
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,402
You're my younger sister, not my mother.

362
00:24:15,619 --> 00:24:16,839
Why are you being so nosy?

363
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:32,038
Hello, your parcel is here.

364
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:33,316
Thank you.

365
00:24:37,903 --> 00:24:39,123
I'll leave it here.

366
00:24:42,429 --> 00:24:44,140
Cheng Xi, something's off.

367
00:24:45,218 --> 00:24:47,089
You're overthinking it.

368
00:24:47,336 --> 00:24:49,766
I'll tell you to make dinner by yourself if you keep talking.

369
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,255
Just tell me if you're in any trouble.

370
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,882
I'm no longer a child. I can face it together with you.

371
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,450
Tell me.

372
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,690
It's Deng Ming.

373
00:25:06,857 --> 00:25:08,202
I knew it.

374
00:25:10,589 --> 00:25:11,900
He came to harass me again.

375
00:25:12,294 --> 00:25:13,962
I gave him a minor punishment.

376
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:18,299
I moved because I was afraid he might find me again.

377
00:25:18,869 --> 00:25:21,379
Why does he keep haunting you?

378
00:25:21,621 --> 00:25:23,422
We should've taught him a lesson long ago.

379
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:25,110
We should've exposed him and his crimes.

380
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,230
No.

381
00:25:26,354 --> 00:25:29,059
We'll only make things more complicated.

382
00:25:29,926 --> 00:25:32,275
But we can't resolve the issue by avoiding it.

383
00:25:34,013 --> 00:25:36,352
I'm not avoiding it. I'm not soft-hearted either.

384
00:25:36,831 --> 00:25:38,442
I'm doing this for my own reasons.

385
00:25:39,365 --> 00:25:41,162
If Deng Ming harasses me again,

386
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:43,305
I'll deal with him in my own way.

387
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,650
Don't worry about it.

388
00:25:45,263 --> 00:25:46,602
I'll hold you to your words.

389
00:25:48,518 --> 00:25:49,639
Cheng Xi,

390
00:25:49,743 --> 00:25:51,103
if he comes again next time,

391
00:25:51,184 --> 00:25:53,283
you must tell me. We'll deal with him together.

392
00:25:54,566 --> 00:25:56,246
My sister is all grown up.

393
00:25:56,327 --> 00:25:58,082
Now, I have someone to depend on.

394
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:02,042
That's why you should make dinner today.

395
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,642
That was my original plan.

396
00:26:06,489 --> 00:26:08,002
What do you plan to make?

397
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,904
I bought pork ribs and yam.

398
00:26:10,042 --> 00:26:11,802
I'll make pork ribs soup for you.

399
00:26:11,896 --> 00:26:13,116
It's your favorite.

400
00:26:13,555 --> 00:26:15,402
- And this... - Yao Yao,

401
00:26:17,262 --> 00:26:20,212
don't tell Wu Jun that I moved out.

402
00:26:23,343 --> 00:26:25,522
He's nice. And he's nice to me too.

403
00:26:26,023 --> 00:26:29,413
But I don't want to get into a new relationship.

404
00:26:31,393 --> 00:26:33,442
Our relationship ends here.

405
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:37,448
This is my choice. Don't interfere, okay?

406
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,642
As long as you're happy.

407
00:26:43,719 --> 00:26:45,011
I'll help you out.

408
00:26:52,857 --> 00:26:53,882
Cheng Yao.

409
00:26:55,294 --> 00:26:56,402
Lawyer Wu.

410
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,922
Did your sister go on a trip?

411
00:26:59,172 --> 00:27:01,322
She's not at home, and I couldn't reach or find her.

412
00:27:02,293 --> 00:27:03,683
Maybe she's on a business trip.

413
00:27:03,816 --> 00:27:05,325
Why did she switch off her phone, then?

414
00:27:05,349 --> 00:27:08,260
She's a lawyer. It'll be troublesome if her clients can't reach her.

415
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,980
Are you hiding something from me?

416
00:27:18,589 --> 00:27:19,809
No?

417
00:27:23,664 --> 00:27:25,030
If so, how do you guys contact each other usually?

418
00:27:25,054 --> 00:27:27,574
You wouldn't look this calm if you couldn't reach her for days.

419
00:27:28,758 --> 00:27:30,268
Cheng Yao, be honest with me.

420
00:27:31,629 --> 00:27:32,849
What happened?

421
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:37,082
Fine, since you're not telling me, I'll rent a tent.

422
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:39,399
I'll stay in front of her house until her return.

423
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,269
Lawyer Wu, stop forcing me.

424
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:43,722
We contact each other through WeChat.

425
00:27:45,984 --> 00:27:47,722
She moved out of her previous unit.

426
00:27:48,054 --> 00:27:50,614
Don't ask me about her address. She doesn't want me to tell you.

427
00:27:51,124 --> 00:27:52,393
Is that her will?

428
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,122
She has her bitter reasons for not telling you.

429
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,669
Okay.

430
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:04,750
She doesn't need to torture herself like that to cut her ties with me.

431
00:28:05,629 --> 00:28:06,849
Please tell her

432
00:28:08,046 --> 00:28:09,722
that I won't contact her again.

433
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,522
Tell her to move back.

434
00:28:13,629 --> 00:28:14,849
Lawyer Wu.

435
00:28:25,515 --> 00:28:30,002
(Cheng Xi, Lawyer Wu thought you moved out to avoid him.)

436
00:28:30,471 --> 00:28:31,922
(He's heartbroken.)

437
00:28:32,066 --> 00:28:33,815
(Why don't you tell him about it?)

438
00:28:37,247 --> 00:28:38,802
(Ending this relationship)

439
00:28:38,913 --> 00:28:40,362
(is better for both of us.)

440
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,242
Boss, what's wrong?

441
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:01,475
As you've been hardworking lately,

442
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:02,802
since I'm free tonight,

443
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:04,723
I'll give you a chance to enjoy a feast with me.

444
00:29:04,747 --> 00:29:06,457
Are you going to treat me to a feast?

445
00:29:06,704 --> 00:29:08,282
Don't be overjoyed yet.

446
00:29:08,707 --> 00:29:10,787
This is just the initial recognition of your effort.

447
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:13,327
Thank you. But I have something to do today.

448
00:29:13,408 --> 00:29:14,701
I can't have dinner with you tonight.

449
00:29:14,725 --> 00:29:16,005
Why don't you find someone else?

450
00:29:17,078 --> 00:29:18,298
No need for that.

451
00:29:48,202 --> 00:29:49,951
(She's still playing hard-to-get.)

452
00:29:50,032 --> 00:29:51,252
(I won't fall for it.)

453
00:29:55,773 --> 00:29:57,522
(Brother, you're dense.)

454
00:29:57,656 --> 00:30:00,515
(For some reason, I think he's cute.)

455
00:30:00,658 --> 00:30:03,247
(It's a tug-of-war between two tsunderes.)

456
00:30:16,893 --> 00:30:18,374
Ting Ting, I got it.

457
00:30:18,455 --> 00:30:20,459
We can head to the notary office and lure Zhang Hao

458
00:30:20,483 --> 00:30:22,605
to give information about his affairs under the witness of the officers.

459
00:30:22,629 --> 00:30:24,589
I'll head there right now. Wait for my good news.

460
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,920
(Yao Yao, there might be an issue with my marriage certificate.)

461
00:30:43,448 --> 00:30:44,668
Here, have some water.

462
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,079
Don't panic.

463
00:30:49,165 --> 00:30:50,975
We'll know whether the certificate is valid or not

464
00:30:50,999 --> 00:30:52,765
after they check the records.

465
00:30:53,063 --> 00:30:55,922
At first, I wasn't worried about its validity at all.

466
00:30:56,485 --> 00:30:59,085
But Zhang Hao posted a wedding photo with Zhang Qiong Qiong in Moments.

467
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:00,470
Zhang Hao isn't that silly.

468
00:31:00,565 --> 00:31:02,525
He won't let us get the goods on him that easily.

469
00:31:03,255 --> 00:31:04,522
Try and think again.

470
00:31:04,637 --> 00:31:07,197
Did something happen when you guys were getting the certificate?

471
00:31:08,224 --> 00:31:10,122
We were about to take the marriage certificate.

472
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:11,748
But I realized that I was pregnant.

473
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:13,220
I had severe morning sickness.

474
00:31:13,429 --> 00:31:15,125
And, I face the possibility of a miscarriage.

475
00:31:15,149 --> 00:31:17,900
I had no way to return to my hometown and acquire the certificate.

476
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,509
After that, Zhang Hao told me

477
00:31:19,589 --> 00:31:21,486
he knew someone from the Civil Affairs Bureau in his hometown.

478
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:23,486
He said we could get the marriage certificate by providing him

479
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:24,859
with our ID cards and hukou.

480
00:31:24,991 --> 00:31:26,602
A friend of mine did the same before.

481
00:31:26,703 --> 00:31:28,202
That's why I believed his words.

482
00:31:28,526 --> 00:31:29,846
According to what you said,

483
00:31:29,934 --> 00:31:32,134
it's likely that he was already planning something else

484
00:31:32,236 --> 00:31:33,805
before you guys got the marriage certificate.

485
00:31:33,829 --> 00:31:35,049
Are you saying

486
00:31:35,726 --> 00:31:37,522
that they had an affair long ago

487
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:40,940
and Zhang Hao didn't wish to be with me when we got the certificate?

488
00:31:41,213 --> 00:31:43,242
If so, why did he get the certificate, then?

489
00:31:45,349 --> 00:31:48,762
I think he did it to get the down payment for the house.

490
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:50,731
I remember that he often

491
00:31:51,449 --> 00:31:54,679
told me about the financial issues he faced before buying a house.

492
00:31:55,187 --> 00:31:57,682
He gave me hints

493
00:31:57,767 --> 00:31:59,766
to borrow money from my family so that we could buy a house.

494
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:02,602
Back then, I thought he was worried about our future.

495
00:32:02,869 --> 00:32:03,870
Now that I look at it,

496
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,670
he was just trying to cheat me of my money

497
00:32:05,765 --> 00:32:07,554
since the beginning.

498
00:32:07,829 --> 00:32:10,922
Yao Yao, I remember that the law acknowledges marriages

499
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:13,579
but not the stability of cohabitation.

500
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:15,882
If Zhang Hao didn't marry me,

501
00:32:16,061 --> 00:32:19,132
does that mean the fidelity agreement is invalid?

502
00:32:19,552 --> 00:32:20,686
We can talk about it once the result is out.

503
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,150
Enough. Stop looking. Give it to me.

504
00:32:22,266 --> 00:32:27,059
(Y003, please head to Counter B30.)

505
00:32:27,339 --> 00:32:28,437
Are you Li Meng Ting?

506
00:32:28,564 --> 00:32:30,383
This is your marriage registration record.

507
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,282
(No marriage registration record was found.)

508
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,882
I shouldn't have trusted him.

509
00:32:43,229 --> 00:32:45,109
No wonder it took him so long

510
00:32:45,284 --> 00:32:47,002
to sign the fidelity agreement.

511
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:49,435
I'm sure he used those few days

512
00:32:49,516 --> 00:32:50,659
to inquire about the fidelity agreement

513
00:32:50,683 --> 00:32:52,059
to make sure that he won't face any legal responsibilities

514
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:53,402
before he signs it.

515
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,960
This is considered

516
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:58,445
forgery of state documents, right?

517
00:32:58,614 --> 00:32:59,964
It's a criminal offense.

518
00:33:00,085 --> 00:33:01,245
Can we send him to prison?

519
00:33:01,326 --> 00:33:02,362
We can't.

520
00:33:02,884 --> 00:33:05,125
Right now, we only have the fake marriage certificate.

521
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:07,526
And, you guys only communicated verbally before taking the certificate.

522
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,770
We don't have solid evidence.

523
00:33:09,191 --> 00:33:11,260
He could say that you didn't give this to him.

524
00:33:11,494 --> 00:33:12,882
What do you mean by that?

525
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,509
He could say that you guys were just a normal couple

526
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:18,495
and that he married Liang Qiong Qiong after breaking up with you.

527
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:21,562
He could say that you fabricated this to frame him.

528
00:33:27,773 --> 00:33:29,842
To think that I majored in law.

529
00:33:30,439 --> 00:33:35,259
- Meng Ting. - He actually played me like a fool.

530
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:38,150
I'm sure he prepared that for a long time.

531
00:33:39,639 --> 00:33:40,938
Try and think again.

532
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,819
How much did each of you pay when you two bought the house?

533
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,210
Back then,

534
00:33:48,238 --> 00:33:50,587
we bought the house after we got married.

535
00:33:52,744 --> 00:33:54,184
We spent four million yuan in total.

536
00:33:54,383 --> 00:33:55,880
My family forked out 1.5 million yuan.

537
00:33:55,904 --> 00:33:56,969
He forked out the rest.

538
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:58,131
He paid the majority of it.

539
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,779
How high is my success rate, then?

540
00:34:00,094 --> 00:34:01,814
House prices are getting higher and higher.

541
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,362
Even if he compensates me,

542
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,156
I can't afford to buy another house with that money.

543
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,358
What gives?

544
00:34:06,439 --> 00:34:08,407
My parents worked so hard to save up all that money.

545
00:34:08,431 --> 00:34:09,798
But in the end, I bought a house

546
00:34:09,908 --> 00:34:12,454
for that scum and his mistress instead of myself.

547
00:34:12,535 --> 00:34:14,066
I'll think of something for you. Don't panic.

548
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:15,310
I'll think of something.

549
00:34:24,189 --> 00:34:25,409
What's wrong?

550
00:34:25,775 --> 00:34:27,482
Zhang Hao's friend

551
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:29,558
said I owed him one million yuan.

552
00:34:29,645 --> 00:34:31,996
He's been urging me to pay up.

553
00:34:32,086 --> 00:34:33,557
Since when did you owe him money?

554
00:34:33,724 --> 00:34:35,914
We didn't have enough money to buy a house back then.

555
00:34:36,093 --> 00:34:38,482
Zhang Hao borrowed one million yuan from his friend.

556
00:34:38,563 --> 00:34:39,832
He said he would repay him in six months.

557
00:34:39,856 --> 00:34:41,253
Now, time's up.

558
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:43,709
He demanded Zhang Hao to repay him, but he ignored him.

559
00:34:43,845 --> 00:34:45,923
After that, he texted me like crazy.

560
00:34:46,004 --> 00:34:48,732
- Calm down. Listen to me. - And he said...

561
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:50,310
Your marriage certificate is fake.

562
00:34:50,459 --> 00:34:52,654
Therefore, you guys don't share the same debt, understood?

563
00:34:52,678 --> 00:34:53,918
You don't need to pay him back.

564
00:34:55,189 --> 00:34:58,802
But I was the one who signed the IOU.

565
00:34:59,414 --> 00:35:00,522
But why?

566
00:35:02,097 --> 00:35:04,082
That friend of his

567
00:35:04,783 --> 00:35:07,642
was from the same hometown.

568
00:35:07,798 --> 00:35:10,122
We don't get to see him usually.

569
00:35:10,322 --> 00:35:13,202
Back then, he came here on a business trip.

570
00:35:13,323 --> 00:35:15,762
He told us to write an IOU for him.

571
00:35:15,862 --> 00:35:18,119
But coincidentally, Zhang Hao was on a business trip too.

572
00:35:18,143 --> 00:35:20,194
I was home alone.

573
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:22,829
I bought him a meal

574
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,950
and signed the IOU for him.

575
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,590
The signature belonged to me.

576
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,334
I didn't overthink it back then.

577
00:35:28,415 --> 00:35:30,939
I thought Zhang Hao and I were family.

578
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:33,017
I don't have money to pay him back...

579
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:34,802
Calm down. Listen to me.

580
00:35:35,589 --> 00:35:37,642
Just stay at home and don't go outside.

581
00:35:37,732 --> 00:35:39,122
I'll figure out the rest for you.

582
00:35:39,327 --> 00:35:40,547
Don't panic.

583
00:35:56,534 --> 00:35:57,739
Morning, Bao.

584
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,162
Morning, Cheng Yao.

585
00:36:03,384 --> 00:36:04,642
What's going on?

586
00:36:04,902 --> 00:36:06,101
Why do you look so sleepy?

587
00:36:06,267 --> 00:36:07,522
What did you do last night?

588
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:09,180
Don't even talk about it.

589
00:36:09,414 --> 00:36:11,042
I encountered issues with my case.

590
00:36:11,123 --> 00:36:13,074
I studied about it extensively last night.

591
00:36:13,752 --> 00:36:15,122
Have you lost your mind?

592
00:36:15,463 --> 00:36:17,642
Your body will fall apart if you do this, you know?

593
00:36:24,471 --> 00:36:25,642
I just bought this coffee.

594
00:36:25,739 --> 00:36:27,939
I didn't take a sip at all. Perk yourself up with this.

595
00:36:28,726 --> 00:36:30,122
Bao, you're so nice.

596
00:36:31,149 --> 00:36:32,482
Everyone knows that.

597
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:43,230
Everyone tells me the same thing.

598
00:36:44,457 --> 00:36:45,690
I guess I'm nice.

599
00:36:48,342 --> 00:36:50,122
Cheng Yao, come to my office.

600
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,042
Come in.

601
00:37:04,607 --> 00:37:05,827
Boss, were you looking for me?

602
00:37:09,471 --> 00:37:10,511
What's wrong?

603
00:37:10,622 --> 00:37:11,982
Did you not sleep well last night?

604
00:37:12,435 --> 00:37:15,264
I encountered some troublesome issues regarding Meng Ting's case.

605
00:37:15,613 --> 00:37:18,202
I studied about it extensively last night.

606
00:37:19,913 --> 00:37:21,133
Show it to me.

607
00:37:25,222 --> 00:37:27,022
This is the current situation.

608
00:37:27,149 --> 00:37:29,430
Not only did Zhang Hao forge the marriage certificate,

609
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,762
but he also tricked Li Meng Ting

610
00:37:31,843 --> 00:37:34,190
into signing the IOU of a million yuan that he borrowed from his friend.

611
00:37:34,214 --> 00:37:36,559
And, Zhang Hao is not willing to pay up now.

612
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,711
Therefore, Zhang Hao's friend is urging Meng Ting to pay up.

613
00:37:42,071 --> 00:37:44,402
Right now, we have no choice but to be passive.

614
00:37:44,926 --> 00:37:47,482
But Meng Ting will give birth soon.

615
00:37:47,563 --> 00:37:49,322
She needs the house urgently.

616
00:37:50,304 --> 00:37:52,430
However, she didn't fork out the majority of the sum.

617
00:37:52,533 --> 00:37:54,163
And, she's in debt too.

618
00:37:54,533 --> 00:37:56,403
Who did he transfer the money to back then?

619
00:37:59,544 --> 00:38:00,584
What are you doing?

620
00:38:00,702 --> 00:38:02,042
I found the answer.

621
00:38:02,192 --> 00:38:05,046
We cannot avoid danger without taking risks, right?

622
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:06,770
Boss, now I know why you're successful.

623
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:08,091
I'll go and find Meng Ting now.

624
00:38:10,309 --> 00:38:11,529
Your document.

625
00:38:17,222 --> 00:38:18,282
Thank you, boss.

626
00:38:27,661 --> 00:38:30,082
Boss, was Cheng Yao too reckless just now?

627
00:38:30,167 --> 00:38:31,248
I know she's insensible.

628
00:38:31,336 --> 00:38:33,256
I'll remind her when I have the chance.

629
00:38:33,423 --> 00:38:34,582
That's not true.

630
00:38:34,663 --> 00:38:36,054
I think I taught her well.

631
00:38:37,984 --> 00:38:39,824
- All right then. - What are you doing here?

632
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:41,922
Here's the indictment.

633
00:38:42,573 --> 00:38:43,793
Are you done?

634
00:38:44,396 --> 00:38:46,722
Fine. I'll dock one month's worth of wage

635
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,362
for every word you type wrongly.

636
00:38:48,503 --> 00:38:49,722
Let me check it again.

637
00:38:58,653 --> 00:39:02,792
You want me to contact Zhang Hao's friend and make him sue me?

638
00:39:03,319 --> 00:39:05,059
And, we need to provide him with enough evidence

639
00:39:05,083 --> 00:39:06,590
to ensure that he can win the lawsuit.

640
00:39:06,614 --> 00:39:08,605
Are you serious?

641
00:39:08,777 --> 00:39:10,390
If we lose the lawsuit,

642
00:39:10,501 --> 00:39:13,171
I have to pay him one million yuan. I don't have the money.

643
00:39:13,321 --> 00:39:15,442
But you'll win by losing the lawsuit.

644
00:39:16,408 --> 00:39:17,628
Do you want some?

645
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,414
Yao Yao, explain yourself. I don't understand.

646
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,390
Back then, you told me that you won the right

647
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:25,165
to buy the house among a few hundred people

648
00:39:25,189 --> 00:39:26,762
by getting a number, right?

649
00:39:27,933 --> 00:39:29,059
You'll choose the house instead of money

650
00:39:29,083 --> 00:39:30,483
when the assets are divided, right?

651
00:39:30,749 --> 00:39:34,660
Yeah. And, I used my first-home eligibility to purchase this house.

652
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:37,899
If I give up now, it'll be difficult for me to purchase another house.

653
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:40,038
I can make money somehow,

654
00:39:40,191 --> 00:39:41,870
but I have to get this house.

655
00:39:41,973 --> 00:39:43,366
That's why I wasn't confident about

656
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:45,671
fighting for the house with Zhang Hao in the first place.

657
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:48,122
But Zhang Hao's action reminded me of something.

658
00:39:48,318 --> 00:39:51,738
As long as we make sure you lose the lawsuit for the loan,

659
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:54,604
the judge will deem the one million yuan in Zhang Hao's mortgage payment

660
00:39:54,628 --> 00:39:55,779
as your money.

661
00:39:55,974 --> 00:39:58,882
It means that the money was just transferred away from his account.

662
00:40:00,392 --> 00:40:03,542
So, that means

663
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:06,700
that once I lose the lawsuit,

664
00:40:06,832 --> 00:40:09,722
we'll be using the law to combat violence.

665
00:40:09,894 --> 00:40:11,790
And, it also helps me to confirm the evidence

666
00:40:11,878 --> 00:40:13,402
before the division of property.

667
00:40:13,629 --> 00:40:15,029
The 2.5 million yuan I forked out

668
00:40:15,144 --> 00:40:16,685
is more than what Zhang Hao had forked out.

669
00:40:16,709 --> 00:40:19,020
If so, that means I stand a chance to win back the house.

670
00:40:19,504 --> 00:40:21,882
At least you still remember some of the things you studied.

671
00:40:22,789 --> 00:40:23,922
Under such situations,

672
00:40:24,032 --> 00:40:26,252
the judge will usually reward you with the house.

673
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,327
And, you just need to repay him 1.5 million yuan.

674
00:40:28,351 --> 00:40:30,446
With the corresponding proportion of the appreciated portion,

675
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,699
you can pay back the one-million-yuan loan accordingly.

676
00:40:33,351 --> 00:40:35,077
Compared to the rate that house prices are rising,

677
00:40:35,101 --> 00:40:36,451
we have the advantage here.

678
00:40:37,109 --> 00:40:38,362
This is great.

679
00:40:38,471 --> 00:40:40,911
Yao Yao, luckily, you're here with me.

680
00:40:41,014 --> 00:40:43,173
I don't even know how to thank you for this.

681
00:40:43,269 --> 00:40:44,270
Without you, I...

682
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:46,220
Enough. Why are you thanking me?

683
00:40:46,589 --> 00:40:50,100
Right now, our priority is to bid our past farewell and start a new life.

684
00:40:51,279 --> 00:40:52,438
I gave it some thought.

685
00:40:52,536 --> 00:40:54,817
This house might sell for ten million yuan in the future.

686
00:40:54,935 --> 00:40:56,485
You might be rich in the future.

687
00:40:59,656 --> 00:41:00,876
Am I right?

688
00:41:10,423 --> 00:41:11,932
Here, have it while it's hot.

689
00:41:13,271 --> 00:41:14,602
I made some chicken porridge.

690
00:41:16,304 --> 00:41:17,304
Yao Yao,

691
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:20,962
do you still have the notes for the bar exam?

692
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:24,922
I was thinking that I'm pregnant.

693
00:41:25,695 --> 00:41:28,336
It's hard to get a job.

694
00:41:28,477 --> 00:41:30,476
Instead of doing nothing at home,

695
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:33,170
I should pick up where I have left off.

696
00:41:33,815 --> 00:41:35,950
I've straightened out my thoughts. I want to be like you.

697
00:41:35,974 --> 00:41:37,150
I want to be a lawyer like you.

698
00:41:37,174 --> 00:41:40,299
I can only protect myself and my loved ones

699
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:41,859
if I'm capable enough.

700
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,202
Okay.

701
00:41:44,283 --> 00:41:45,882
I'll bring the notes to you tomorrow.

702
00:41:50,918 --> 00:41:52,138
Have it slowly.

703
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:04,122
Time to eat.

704
00:42:46,862 --> 00:42:49,282
(Today's a day filled with a great sense of achievement.)
