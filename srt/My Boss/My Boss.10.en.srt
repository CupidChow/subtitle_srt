1
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,762
(My Boss)

2
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:41,506
(Episode 10)

3
00:01:41,587 --> 00:01:43,751
(Congratulations, you passed the test.)

4
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:46,682
(Boss, this is the first time you've praised me.)

5
00:01:51,463 --> 00:01:52,563
Come in.

6
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:56,002
- Boss. - As a lawyer, don't show your emotions.

7
00:01:56,862 --> 00:01:58,162
You are right.

8
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,040
Boss, I found out there's more to Dong Shan's case.

9
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:05,202
He wants a divorce not because he's sick.

10
00:02:05,287 --> 00:02:07,779
It's because he is having an affair, and they even have a child together.

11
00:02:07,803 --> 00:02:09,563
That's why he's in a hurry to get a divorce.

12
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,261
How did you find out?

13
00:02:12,342 --> 00:02:13,722
When I was talking to him,

14
00:02:13,808 --> 00:02:15,682
he said something that didn't match his age.

15
00:02:15,856 --> 00:02:17,577
I found it strange at the time.

16
00:02:17,687 --> 00:02:20,836
Later, I found out his assets included a private villa.

17
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:24,082
I thought I'd try my luck there.

18
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,280
I caught them on the scene.

19
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,320
Cheng Yao.

20
00:02:28,528 --> 00:02:30,208
You finally learned to think for yourself.

21
00:02:30,581 --> 00:02:31,642
I'm glad.

22
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,231
Why aren't you surprised?

23
00:02:34,838 --> 00:02:36,562
Or, did you already know?

24
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,122
No, I didn't.

25
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,191
I just know Dong Shan very well.

26
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,825
When I took on this case, I already had my doubts.

27
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,696
I just wanted to give you a chance to discover the truth for yourself.

28
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,322
Congratulations, you passed the test.

29
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:53,286
Boss, this is the first time you've praised me.

30
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,896
If you can't even figure out such a simple issue,

31
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,600
then there's no need for you to work here.

32
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,521
I know. If it were you, you would have noticed it at a glance.

33
00:03:03,765 --> 00:03:05,795
But, how can I compare to you?

34
00:03:06,981 --> 00:03:11,522
Every young lawyer grows from one simple case to another.

35
00:03:12,841 --> 00:03:13,911
Boss, don't worry.

36
00:03:14,001 --> 00:03:15,484
I will definitely give it my all.

37
00:03:15,565 --> 00:03:16,842
I will put in 100% effort.

38
00:03:16,981 --> 00:03:19,262
- I will definitely succeed. - You'll never surpass me.

39
00:03:23,382 --> 00:03:24,562
But boss,

40
00:03:25,036 --> 00:03:26,791
to celebrate your first time praising me,

41
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,180
what should we have for dinner?

42
00:03:28,381 --> 00:03:30,002
Seafood? Steak?

43
00:03:30,622 --> 00:03:32,062
Or, you can order whatever you want.

44
00:03:35,778 --> 00:03:37,741
No need. I have a client appointment.

45
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,240
I won't be home for dinner tonight.

46
00:03:39,771 --> 00:03:41,681
Okay. Then, I'll make it for you next time.

47
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,100
I go to work now.

48
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,394
Hello, I'm the administrator here.

49
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:04,278
Recently, there have been multiple cases of sexual harassment here.

50
00:04:04,614 --> 00:04:06,625
If there are any female residents in your household,

51
00:04:06,649 --> 00:04:08,039
please be extra cautious.

52
00:04:08,356 --> 00:04:11,455
Such illegal behavior in the neighborhood should not only be reminded.

53
00:04:11,536 --> 00:04:12,816
Why not report it to the police?

54
00:04:12,872 --> 00:04:16,184
We have already reported it. But, this suspect is a repeat offender.

55
00:04:16,328 --> 00:04:18,842
He is very familiar with the surroundings of the neighborhood.

56
00:04:19,303 --> 00:04:21,293
We have already organized a team to catch him.

57
00:04:21,381 --> 00:04:23,042
However, he has still managed to escape.

58
00:04:23,254 --> 00:04:24,768
Now, we have organized security guards

59
00:04:24,792 --> 00:04:26,722
to patrol 24 hours a day.

60
00:04:27,421 --> 00:04:30,131
The neighborhood is so big. Can you patrol every area?

61
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:31,698
You can rest assured about this.

62
00:04:31,722 --> 00:04:34,699
The public areas are all covered by cameras.

63
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,151
What about the non-public areas?

64
00:04:52,462 --> 00:04:53,637
Cheng Yao.

65
00:04:59,326 --> 00:05:00,966
She is quite diligent in walking her dog.

66
00:05:11,434 --> 00:05:14,195
(Recently, there have been multiple cases of sexual harassment here.)

67
00:05:14,261 --> 00:05:16,320
(If there are any female residents in your household, )

68
00:05:16,344 --> 00:05:17,744
(please be extra cautious.)

69
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,960
(She might just be accidentally walking too far while walking her dog.)

70
00:06:07,109 --> 00:06:11,020
(Sorry. The number you've dialed is currently unavailable.)

71
00:06:14,715 --> 00:06:16,397
(During the time when employees and the boss shared the rent, )

72
00:06:16,421 --> 00:06:19,762
(if a personal accident occurs, the boss can't avoid responsibility.)

73
00:06:20,527 --> 00:06:21,767
(As a lawyer, )

74
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,121
(one must have the awareness to proactively avoid risks.)

75
00:06:27,097 --> 00:06:29,005
She is about 1.66m tall,

76
00:06:29,086 --> 00:06:30,595
weighing around 40kg.

77
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,640
She has long black hair. She is very beautiful, especially her eyes.

78
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,722
Not extremely beautiful, but a bit pretty.

79
00:06:35,953 --> 00:06:37,253
Do you all remember?

80
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,242
Whoever finds her first, I'll pay them three months' salary.

81
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,405
Sir, you really care about your girlfriend.

82
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,921
She's just out walking the dog.

83
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,376
She's only been gone for two hours.

84
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,716
Maybe she returned to get a late-night snack.

85
00:06:48,797 --> 00:06:50,837
Why are you talking so much? Hurry up and find her.

86
00:06:51,334 --> 00:06:52,402
Cheng Yao!

87
00:06:54,888 --> 00:06:56,442
Look how excited you are.

88
00:06:56,523 --> 00:06:59,442
You must be going crazy being stuck at home all the time, right?

89
00:07:00,482 --> 00:07:01,924
Excuse me.

90
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,622
Do you know how to get to Building 5?

91
00:07:03,702 --> 00:07:06,037
Go straight from there until you reach the first intersection.

92
00:07:06,061 --> 00:07:07,517
Then, turn right and you'll be there.

93
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,409
- Okay, thanks. - You're welcome.

94
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,722
Wei Zhen Tian!

95
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,630
How can you eat rubbish?

96
00:07:15,093 --> 00:07:16,292
Wei Zhen Tian.

97
00:07:16,381 --> 00:07:18,296
I'm telling you. If anything happens to Cheng Yao,

98
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,720
I will sue your property management company into bankruptcy.

99
00:07:20,861 --> 00:07:22,682
Boss, help me catch it.

100
00:07:27,974 --> 00:07:29,202
No.

101
00:07:42,655 --> 00:07:43,762
Boss.

102
00:07:44,252 --> 00:07:45,442
I'm sorry.

103
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:55,842
What did it eat?

104
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,069
You wouldn't want to know.

105
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,140
Cheng Yao, hurry up.

106
00:08:10,381 --> 00:08:11,681
It'll be ready soon.

107
00:08:13,022 --> 00:08:14,639
Faster. If you keep dawdling,

108
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,722
I'll throw you and your stupid dog out together.

109
00:08:16,803 --> 00:08:18,722
Boss, I'm making foam.

110
00:08:19,002 --> 00:08:20,268
I know you're in a hurry,

111
00:08:20,358 --> 00:08:22,858
but if you can't wait, you can wash it first.

112
00:08:25,049 --> 00:08:26,369
I don't want to touch its saliva.

113
00:08:26,432 --> 00:08:28,338
If I wanted to touch it, I would have done it already.

114
00:08:28,362 --> 00:08:29,482
- Done. - It's too smelly.

115
00:08:29,563 --> 00:08:30,682
Come on.

116
00:08:32,943 --> 00:08:34,122
Hurry up.

117
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,023
- Where is it? - Here.

118
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,040
It's really smelly.

119
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,402
I told you!

120
00:08:47,302 --> 00:08:48,812
Hurry up and wash it.

121
00:08:55,283 --> 00:08:56,322
Boss.

122
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:59,202
I spent a few hundred yuan on this facial cleanser.

123
00:08:59,702 --> 00:09:01,202
I usually don't use it myself.

124
00:09:01,318 --> 00:09:04,122
Today, I happen to take it out to show my respect to you, boss.

125
00:09:11,302 --> 00:09:12,362
Is it better now?

126
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,480
Boss, I know Wei Zhen Tian made a big mistake today.

127
00:09:24,569 --> 00:09:26,562
I might even get punished for it.

128
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:30,222
Maybe, tomorrow I will be fired from the company

129
00:09:30,263 --> 00:09:32,942
for entering through the left or right foot first.

130
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,122
But, boss, I am already trying to fix it.

131
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,870
I will definitely not let your handsome face be tarnished.

132
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,980
Otherwise,

133
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:42,522
your male attractiveness will decrease by one level.

134
00:09:48,261 --> 00:09:49,561
Done.

135
00:09:51,071 --> 00:09:52,461
Let's wash up here too.

136
00:09:52,762 --> 00:09:53,917
No need for here.

137
00:10:01,582 --> 00:10:04,541
Boss, you don't need to worry so much next time.

138
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:05,941
I have Wei Zhen Tian with me.

139
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:08,202
In case something happens, it can bark.

140
00:10:10,062 --> 00:10:11,222
But, boss,

141
00:10:11,302 --> 00:10:13,682
the way you rushed over just now was really cool.

142
00:10:31,609 --> 00:10:32,882
Wei Zhen Tian.

143
00:10:34,761 --> 00:10:35,962
Silly dog.

144
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:40,095
You can't do this again next time. You almost got exiled.

145
00:10:40,176 --> 00:10:41,295
Do you know?

146
00:11:03,501 --> 00:11:04,812
Good morning, boss.

147
00:11:05,303 --> 00:11:06,520
To calm you down,

148
00:11:06,608 --> 00:11:09,407
today's breakfast has both Chinese and Western options.

149
00:11:09,488 --> 00:11:10,788
Which one do you prefer?

150
00:11:12,222 --> 00:11:15,322
Flattering me won't work unless you make Wei Zhen Tian disappear.

151
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,042
I know you were angry about what happened yesterday.

152
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,285
But, can you give Wei Zhen Tian,

153
00:11:21,366 --> 00:11:24,242
who is just a puppy, another chance to turn over a new leaf?

154
00:11:25,303 --> 00:11:27,092
So, this is how you apologize?

155
00:11:28,934 --> 00:11:34,191
Boss, not everyone can relive their old dreams.

156
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,576
Boss, were you also attacked by a dog when you were young?

157
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,004
Once bitten, twice shy, right?

158
00:11:38,085 --> 00:11:40,554
Reliving old dreams? Once bitten, twice shy?

159
00:11:42,513 --> 00:11:44,799
Boss, I will definitely take good care of Wei Zhen Tian.

160
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,496
No third time. There won't be a next time.

161
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,699
If it happens again, I'll take the punishment for it. Is that okay?

162
00:11:48,723 --> 00:11:50,162
Don't try to avoid making supper.

163
00:11:50,302 --> 00:11:51,482
How could I?

164
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,002
Your quality of sleep is the most important issue to me.

165
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:57,082
No matter what, I will ensure every supper is prepared well for you.

166
00:11:57,461 --> 00:11:59,402
Boss, I'll get my salary today.

167
00:11:59,582 --> 00:12:00,682
As an apology,

168
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,180
can I treat you to a meal?

169
00:12:03,027 --> 00:12:04,787
Is your salary enough for me to have a meal?

170
00:12:06,981 --> 00:12:08,462
Actually, it's not enough.

171
00:12:08,582 --> 00:12:10,762
I'm just a poor worker.

172
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:13,621
Do you want me to give you some extra bonus?

173
00:12:15,245 --> 00:12:18,442
Really? Boss, you have a big heart.

174
00:12:21,104 --> 00:12:23,004
Take a look at your bank account balance.

175
00:12:23,102 --> 00:12:24,452
Then, you'll be clear-headed.

176
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,909
What grudges do you have?

177
00:12:45,741 --> 00:12:47,612
The scenery outside is nice.

178
00:12:48,846 --> 00:12:50,287
Why did you invite me here?

179
00:12:50,421 --> 00:12:51,770
Here's my thought.

180
00:12:51,902 --> 00:12:53,360
Even if you're a public interest lawyer,

181
00:12:53,384 --> 00:12:56,002
you also need a fixed place to work, right?

182
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,040
This place is convenient and Junheng & Co is right next to it.

183
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,200
If you want to go see Cheng Yao, you can go anytime.

184
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:02,527
Perfect.

185
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:03,682
Indeed.

186
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,482
- Then, we'll put the desk here. - Okay.

187
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,189
The lighting is good here.

188
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,319
- I can put a sofa there to make it a guest area. - Okay.

189
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,754
Put some tea and fruit platters here.

190
00:13:14,901 --> 00:13:16,642
Then, it'll be a good place to relax.

191
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:19,539
I told you we have a good tacit understanding.

192
00:13:19,563 --> 00:13:20,762
Our thoughts are aligned.

193
00:13:20,887 --> 00:13:24,962
We can put a money tree at the entrance to attract wealth.

194
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,789
I've put one at Junheng & Co too.

195
00:13:29,104 --> 00:13:30,413
Wu Jun, thank you.

196
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,390
But I can't accept it.

197
00:13:32,581 --> 00:13:33,678
Wu Jun, you saw it on your own.

198
00:13:33,702 --> 00:13:36,663
The place where I usually work is either in the countryside or the suburbs.

199
00:13:36,687 --> 00:13:38,922
Or, it's a shanty town or a demolition area.

200
00:13:39,063 --> 00:13:40,652
I don't need this place.

201
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,909
But, thank you anyway.

202
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,922
It's like this.

203
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,202
I've run into some trouble and was hoping you could help.

204
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,122
I can't just come empty-handed, right?

205
00:13:54,673 --> 00:13:59,202
Our law firm received cases assigned by the Legal Aid Center.

206
00:13:59,308 --> 00:14:00,926
As you know, people at our law firm

207
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:02,608
either wear a grumpy face or exhibit a spoiled attitude.

208
00:14:02,632 --> 00:14:05,762
Having them do legal aid work would probably scare people away, right?

209
00:14:06,152 --> 00:14:07,202
I have no other choice.

210
00:14:07,283 --> 00:14:09,162
I need your help urgently.

211
00:14:09,379 --> 00:14:11,379
This influences our firm's chances of receiving the Golden Scale Award.

212
00:14:11,403 --> 00:14:12,737
All right? Can you do me a favor?

213
00:14:12,861 --> 00:14:15,522
No problem. You can come to me anytime.

214
00:14:15,744 --> 00:14:18,682
But, I really can't take this office. I don't need it either.

215
00:14:21,457 --> 00:14:22,809
Fine, you won't take the office.

216
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,440
Then, what about me?

217
00:14:25,138 --> 00:14:26,620
Yes, me.

218
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:28,434
How about I be your assistant?

219
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:31,323
This job was originally mine.

220
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:35,266
It was assigned to me. So, of course I have to do it well.

221
00:14:36,582 --> 00:14:37,974
But, being a public interest lawyer

222
00:14:37,998 --> 00:14:40,402
is different from the cases you usually handle.

223
00:14:40,483 --> 00:14:42,642
It's okay. I'm not afraid of hardship or tiredness.

224
00:14:42,765 --> 00:14:45,511
For our Golden Scale Award, I can endure anything.

225
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,629
So, starting today,

226
00:14:49,462 --> 00:14:51,011
I'll be your assistant.

227
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,442
Mrs. Zhang.

228
00:15:06,535 --> 00:15:08,242
Lawyer Cheng, you finally came back.

229
00:15:08,323 --> 00:15:09,602
My husband's case...

230
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,762
- Come inside and talk. - Okay.

231
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:24,319
Mrs. Zhang, take this.

232
00:15:24,462 --> 00:15:25,762
Drink it first.

233
00:15:28,775 --> 00:15:31,352
The place you live is always dark and damp.

234
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:34,082
It's easy to catch a cold and cross-infect here.

235
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,590
You must take care of your health.

236
00:15:37,342 --> 00:15:39,382
I have already submitted the evidence and documents

237
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,412
related to your husband's work injury to the court.

238
00:15:41,436 --> 00:15:43,675
The court hearing date is next month.

239
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:44,888
Everything is in order.

240
00:15:45,043 --> 00:15:46,244
Don't worry.

241
00:15:46,384 --> 00:15:49,322
The most important thing right now is to take care of your health.

242
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:51,202
Your husband still relies on you.

243
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:05,044
Mrs. Zhang, I have something to attend to outside.

244
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,206
Please wait for me here. I'll be back soon.

245
00:16:07,325 --> 00:16:08,565
Please continue with your work.

246
00:16:12,673 --> 00:16:13,762
Come out.

247
00:16:21,476 --> 00:16:22,556
Cheng Xi.

248
00:16:22,637 --> 00:16:24,457
I think this place of yours is really nice

249
00:16:24,653 --> 00:16:27,282
with the little flowers, trees, and birds.

250
00:16:27,482 --> 00:16:28,842
How did you know I live here?

251
00:16:28,965 --> 00:16:30,265
Have you investigated me?

252
00:16:30,542 --> 00:16:32,222
Look at how you're talking.

253
00:16:32,435 --> 00:16:34,011
I'm just concerned about you.

254
00:16:34,182 --> 00:16:36,061
My client is waiting for me in the house.

255
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,400
If you have something to say, say it quickly and leave.

256
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,624
Oh, right. It's about my safety box's password. I suddenly forgot it.

257
00:16:44,705 --> 00:16:46,322
I was worried, so I came to ask you.

258
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,282
But, on the way,

259
00:16:48,392 --> 00:16:50,861
the more I thought about it, the more upset I became.

260
00:16:53,822 --> 00:16:54,842
I feel

261
00:16:56,162 --> 00:16:58,427
that this home is not complete without you.

262
00:17:01,009 --> 00:17:02,522
The safety box's password

263
00:17:02,745 --> 00:17:04,856
is the date we got married.

264
00:17:05,381 --> 00:17:07,202
How could you forget that?

265
00:17:10,661 --> 00:17:11,762
Cheng Xi,

266
00:17:11,848 --> 00:17:14,359
I can tell you have me in your heart.

267
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:17,082
Actually, I have you in mine too.

268
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,242
How could I forget?

269
00:17:19,384 --> 00:17:20,864
You haven't changed in so many years.

270
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,619
You're still so beautiful.

271
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,750
If you have me in your heart,

272
00:17:25,877 --> 00:17:27,962
how could you forget

273
00:17:29,042 --> 00:17:30,722
we have already divorced.

274
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:33,340
No, it hurts.

275
00:17:33,421 --> 00:17:35,355
Lawyer Cheng, are you done?

276
00:17:35,436 --> 00:17:37,842
I'm in a hurry. I still have things to do later.

277
00:17:38,102 --> 00:17:39,282
Hurry.

278
00:17:39,363 --> 00:17:41,047
This time, I'll spare you.

279
00:17:41,145 --> 00:17:42,745
If you come again, I'll call the police.

280
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,482
No worries.

281
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,202
So cruel.

282
00:17:55,318 --> 00:17:56,698
I heard something was off,

283
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,140
so I purposely interrupted.

284
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:00,642
- Lawyer Cheng, are you okay? - I'm fine.

285
00:18:00,744 --> 00:18:02,682
- Mrs. Zhang, you sit first. - Okay.

286
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:11,416
(There's an authentic Brazilian restaurant near my house.)

287
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,602
(Let's try it out.)

288
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:31,602
Boss.

289
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,120
Boss. I have organized the information of Dong Shan's case.

290
00:18:38,215 --> 00:18:40,290
Take a look and see if there's anything that needs improvement.

291
00:18:40,314 --> 00:18:41,322
Cheng Yao.

292
00:18:42,157 --> 00:18:44,117
You don't need to continue with Dong Shan's case.

293
00:18:44,736 --> 00:18:45,962
Why?

294
00:18:46,262 --> 00:18:48,845
Is there something I didn't do well enough? You can tell me.

295
00:18:49,239 --> 00:18:50,294
No.

296
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:51,842
You did a great job.

297
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,350
It's not your fault.

298
00:18:53,727 --> 00:18:55,197
Then, what happened?

299
00:18:56,621 --> 00:18:58,131
Did Dong Shan withdraw the lawsuit?

300
00:19:04,472 --> 00:19:05,562
He's dead.

301
00:19:07,381 --> 00:19:08,722
How could this happen?

302
00:19:11,742 --> 00:19:13,602
Dong Shan's death was completely accidental.

303
00:19:14,093 --> 00:19:16,864
Early this morning, he was rushing to the airport for a business trip.

304
00:19:16,888 --> 00:19:19,362
A large truck, due to overloading, overturned

305
00:19:19,471 --> 00:19:20,750
and crushed his car.

306
00:19:20,995 --> 00:19:22,295
He died on the spot.

307
00:19:24,406 --> 00:19:27,006
This is the death certificate that his assistant just faxed over.

308
00:19:31,032 --> 00:19:32,361
During the divorce proceedings,

309
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:34,882
if one party dies, the lawsuit will be terminated.

310
00:19:35,263 --> 00:19:37,122
So, we don't need to continue with this case.

311
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,722
As for Dong Shan,

312
00:19:40,522 --> 00:19:43,642
at least half of his goal has been achieved.

313
00:19:44,221 --> 00:19:46,842
His marriage with Jiang Wen Xiu has indeed come to an end,

314
00:19:47,802 --> 00:19:49,511
but through death.

315
00:19:50,701 --> 00:19:54,042
He definitely didn't expect to end his marriage this way.

316
00:19:55,947 --> 00:19:57,158
Oh, by the way,

317
00:19:57,278 --> 00:19:59,588
Dong Shan's memorial service will be held in an hour.

318
00:19:59,812 --> 00:20:01,852
His assistant informed me of the time and location.

319
00:20:02,102 --> 00:20:04,762
As a lawyer, I want to send him off.

320
00:20:05,778 --> 00:20:07,162
According to tradition,

321
00:20:07,266 --> 00:20:09,802
isn't the memorial service supposed to be held in three days?

322
00:20:09,951 --> 00:20:11,461
Why is there such a hurry?

323
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:19,651
But boss, you'll have a meeting with a potential client in the morning

324
00:20:20,577 --> 00:20:22,937
to discuss representing them in an inheritance dispute case

325
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,400
with a value of 1 billion.

326
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:27,722
Cheng Yao, please communicate with the client and try to reschedule.

327
00:20:27,888 --> 00:20:30,602
If they don't agree, then cancel and apologize to them.

328
00:20:30,685 --> 00:20:33,243
But in that case, we might push the clients to another law firm.

329
00:20:33,267 --> 00:20:34,362
I know.

330
00:20:35,558 --> 00:20:37,357
Then, I'll call the client right away.

331
00:20:37,461 --> 00:20:38,562
Cheng Yao.

332
00:20:39,742 --> 00:20:41,442
Come with me to the memorial service.

333
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:51,762
(Resident Death Medical Certificate)

334
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:05,122
(In Our Memory)

335
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,802
Thank you.

336
00:21:46,421 --> 00:21:48,252
My father, Dong Shan,

337
00:21:49,022 --> 00:21:50,722
was a good father

338
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:53,922
and a good husband.

339
00:21:54,684 --> 00:21:56,315
When I was young,

340
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,151
he and my mother

341
00:21:58,394 --> 00:22:00,322
started the business from scratch.

342
00:22:00,474 --> 00:22:02,474
There was deep affection between husband and wife.

343
00:22:03,829 --> 00:22:07,602
They gave me the best life with their utmost efforts.

344
00:22:08,604 --> 00:22:09,904
Today,

345
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:13,482
with a heavy heart,

346
00:22:14,793 --> 00:22:16,882
I mourn my father here.

347
00:22:19,941 --> 00:22:21,731
He was my first client.

348
00:22:23,502 --> 00:22:24,882
At that time,

349
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,562
I was just a young lawyer

350
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,911
without experience or reputation.

351
00:22:31,022 --> 00:22:32,372
But, Dong Shan

352
00:22:32,987 --> 00:22:34,562
still chose to trust me.

353
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,002
My condolences.

354
00:22:46,318 --> 00:22:47,618
My condolences.

355
00:22:50,098 --> 00:22:51,398
Lawyer Qian.

356
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,109
Thank you for coming today to attend my father's funeral.

357
00:22:56,488 --> 00:22:57,928
Mr. Dong was my client.

358
00:22:58,014 --> 00:22:59,162
It's my duty.

359
00:23:00,944 --> 00:23:02,144
Lawyer Qian.

360
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:06,911
I would like to take a moment of your time. Is that okay?

361
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,439
Of course.

362
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,396
Good. Thank you.

363
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,402
Min.

364
00:23:12,669 --> 00:23:13,742
You can go out first.

365
00:23:13,822 --> 00:23:16,433
I have something to discuss with the two lawyers.

366
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:18,239
- Mom, you... - Listen to me.

367
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,482
Go out.

368
00:23:19,944 --> 00:23:21,042
Okay.

369
00:23:28,262 --> 00:23:29,402
Please.

370
00:23:31,692 --> 00:23:35,802
(In Our Memory)

371
00:23:36,461 --> 00:23:37,891
There are some things

372
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:40,386
I've been holding in my heart for a long time.

373
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,151
If I don't express it today,

374
00:23:43,536 --> 00:23:45,340
I'm uncertain whether I'll muster the courage

375
00:23:45,421 --> 00:23:46,981
to say those words again in the future.

376
00:23:49,404 --> 00:23:54,349
From the moment I met Dong to our marriage

377
00:23:54,837 --> 00:23:56,627
and the subsequent birth of Min,

378
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,631
our journey has been full of obstacles.

379
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,802
Back then, my family had good financial conditions,

380
00:24:06,966 --> 00:24:09,316
but Dong was penniless.

381
00:24:10,023 --> 00:24:12,144
Both of our parents didn't approve of us,

382
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,588
and we got married under pressure.

383
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,722
Our wedding

384
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,171
didn't receive any blessings from our elders.

385
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,682
I secretly ran away from home to marry him,

386
00:24:30,341 --> 00:24:32,770
without a single penny on me.

387
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,716
And, that's how we started from scratch,

388
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,431
working hard until now.

389
00:24:42,192 --> 00:24:44,802
I know Dong wants to divorce me.

390
00:24:46,502 --> 00:24:48,211
I was devastated.

391
00:24:51,428 --> 00:24:52,779
But,

392
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,209
I am clear in my heart

393
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,285
that the decade-long relationship between Dong and I

394
00:24:59,309 --> 00:25:00,658
over the past few decades

395
00:25:01,404 --> 00:25:03,524
has weathered many storms without fundamental issues.

396
00:25:03,553 --> 00:25:07,052
Any conflicts could be resolved.

397
00:25:07,762 --> 00:25:08,882
So,

398
00:25:08,971 --> 00:25:10,271
this marriage

399
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,510
cannot be ended.

400
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:17,642
I just

401
00:25:21,322 --> 00:25:23,242
didn't expect Dong

402
00:25:24,928 --> 00:25:26,162
to suddenly...

403
00:25:39,221 --> 00:25:40,602
Dear lawyers,

404
00:25:41,671 --> 00:25:43,322
apart from me,

405
00:25:44,402 --> 00:25:46,922
only Min and some close individuals in the company

406
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,282
know about the divorce proceedings.

407
00:25:51,102 --> 00:25:52,852
No one else is aware of it.

408
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,802
So

409
00:25:57,858 --> 00:25:59,082
Today,

410
00:26:00,582 --> 00:26:02,612
I would like to ask you two

411
00:26:03,176 --> 00:26:05,082
to keep this secret for us.

412
00:26:07,701 --> 00:26:09,772
Dong has already left.

413
00:26:10,742 --> 00:26:15,232
Could you please leave our family with a bit of dignity?

414
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,242
Is that okay?

415
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:22,240
Myself and every client

416
00:26:22,396 --> 00:26:24,225
are bound by confidentiality agreements.

417
00:26:25,381 --> 00:26:27,722
Even if the service appointment is no longer valid,

418
00:26:27,862 --> 00:26:30,161
the confidentiality agreement remains in effect permanently.

419
00:26:30,185 --> 00:26:31,442
You can rest assured.

420
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:34,242
Okay.

421
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,820
Okay.

422
00:26:37,982 --> 00:26:39,282
Thank you.

423
00:26:40,597 --> 00:26:41,897
Thank you.

424
00:26:52,381 --> 00:26:53,482
Boss.

425
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,670
Why do I feel like you don't like Jiang Wen Xiu?

426
00:26:57,701 --> 00:27:00,171
It's not that I don't like her. It's just business.

427
00:27:02,174 --> 00:27:06,282
All I can say is, this outcome might not be too bad for Jiang Wen Xiu.

428
00:27:06,701 --> 00:27:08,842
She doesn't know about Dong Shan's affair.

429
00:27:09,948 --> 00:27:13,059
Did you witness how devastated she was at the memorial service?

430
00:27:13,262 --> 00:27:15,742
It seems like she will never forget Dong Shan in her lifetime.

431
00:27:15,941 --> 00:27:17,241
She knows.

432
00:27:17,961 --> 00:27:19,042
Knows what?

433
00:27:19,123 --> 00:27:20,423
She knows everything.

434
00:27:21,076 --> 00:27:22,866
Does she know about Dong Shan's affair?

435
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:26,322
That's not right.

436
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,400
But, she looked so sad and distressed

437
00:27:28,567 --> 00:27:29,942
at the memorial service earlier.

438
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,830
Could it be an act?

439
00:27:32,782 --> 00:27:35,162
Jiang Wen Xiu and Dong Shan started from scratch together.

440
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:37,166
Even the public was unaware that the key figure

441
00:27:37,635 --> 00:27:40,442
in making Zhenwei Catering successful is not Dong Shan,

442
00:27:41,022 --> 00:27:43,482
but Jiang Wen Xiu.

443
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:46,362
She is a woman with great business acumen and courage.

444
00:27:46,661 --> 00:27:48,211
Her sadness is real.

445
00:27:49,164 --> 00:27:52,033
But, she also has plans for herself.

446
00:27:53,982 --> 00:27:55,812
Boss, why do you say so?

447
00:27:57,062 --> 00:27:59,541
She didn't even follow the custom of

448
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,682
keeping the body for three days before cremation.

449
00:28:02,572 --> 00:28:03,827
He passed away early in the morning

450
00:28:03,851 --> 00:28:06,318
and the memorial service was held in the afternoon, followed by cremation.

451
00:28:06,342 --> 00:28:08,390
- Why is that? - She knew everything.

452
00:28:08,471 --> 00:28:10,122
And she knew they had a child.

453
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:14,022
That's why she's in such a hurry to cremate the body

454
00:28:14,148 --> 00:28:16,098
in order to avoid assets division.

455
00:28:17,382 --> 00:28:19,162
Not bad. Not too stupid.

456
00:28:21,858 --> 00:28:23,902
Non-marital children and marital children

457
00:28:24,007 --> 00:28:25,742
have the same inheritance rights.

458
00:28:25,858 --> 00:28:28,334
But, in order to prove that this child has inheritance rights,

459
00:28:28,358 --> 00:28:30,726
it must be proven that he is related to Dong Shan.

460
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,642
A DNA test must be done.

461
00:28:33,355 --> 00:28:36,762
That's why Jiang Wen Xiu is in such a hurry to cremate Dong Shan's body.

462
00:28:37,921 --> 00:28:40,442
It's about destroying his body tissues and DNA, right?

463
00:28:41,055 --> 00:28:42,202
Yes.

464
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,480
In this way, that woman will have no way to claim for a paternity test.

465
00:28:45,941 --> 00:28:47,182
She wants to completely deny

466
00:28:47,262 --> 00:28:49,543
the existence of this illegitimate child from the source.

467
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,108
So, that's why

468
00:28:51,244 --> 00:28:52,324
she asked us to meet

469
00:28:52,451 --> 00:28:54,242
and also asked us to keep it a secret.

470
00:29:35,569 --> 00:29:37,057
(Have you finished reading the materials I sent you?)

471
00:29:37,081 --> 00:29:38,681
(Next week's meeting is very important.)

472
00:29:42,621 --> 00:29:45,171
(The case strategy has already been emailed to you.)

473
00:29:50,621 --> 00:29:52,341
(No need to take Wei Zhen Tian for a walk?)

474
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:57,122
(It has already been walked after dinner.)

475
00:30:09,154 --> 00:30:11,874
(Being diligent in observing the emotional pressure of subordinates)

476
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,910
(and then taking appropriate measures)

477
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,510
(is a normal part of being a boss to manage employees.)

478
00:30:29,102 --> 00:30:30,451
Wei Zhen Tian,

479
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:32,762
do you think that in the end,

480
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,162
marriage will always turn into a chess game?

481
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,030
Not surprising.

482
00:30:39,116 --> 00:30:40,476
The law only protects assets

483
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:42,082
but cannot protect feelings.

484
00:30:44,495 --> 00:30:46,776
These things are too distracting for me.

485
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,167
They have caused great disturbance to my working environment.

486
00:30:49,191 --> 00:30:50,442
I hope you can handle it.

487
00:30:56,342 --> 00:30:58,101
Has your question to Wei Zhen Tian just now

488
00:30:58,181 --> 00:30:59,502
been bothering you so much?

489
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:01,247
I thought you would have a deeper understanding

490
00:31:01,271 --> 00:31:02,511
after becoming a family lawyer.

491
00:31:09,181 --> 00:31:10,242
Right.

492
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,002
My sister used to have a good relationship with Deng Ming.

493
00:31:13,168 --> 00:31:15,728
But, they ended up breaking up and she even got deceived by him.

494
00:31:19,413 --> 00:31:21,053
There are still people who are different.

495
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:24,481
My parents are different.

496
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,242
There's no involvement of interests between them.

497
00:31:28,346 --> 00:31:31,626
I still haven't found out how they maintain the bond.

498
00:31:31,766 --> 00:31:33,486
Could it be you, boss?

499
00:31:33,694 --> 00:31:34,742
You're so outstanding.

500
00:31:34,884 --> 00:31:36,434
You must be their pride.

501
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,042
Maybe you're their common language.

502
00:31:39,686 --> 00:31:41,136
My dad thinks I'm not focused on my work.

503
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,680
He advises me to dissolve Junheng & Co

504
00:31:42,742 --> 00:31:44,142
and go home to inherit the company.

505
00:31:44,181 --> 00:31:45,702
How can that be, boss?

506
00:31:45,796 --> 00:31:47,541
You are Junheng & Co's top lawyer.

507
00:31:47,621 --> 00:31:49,092
What will we do if you leave?

508
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,840
You don't have to worry.

509
00:31:51,132 --> 00:31:52,702
Your probation period is almost over.

510
00:31:52,797 --> 00:31:55,157
You have a higher chance of leaving Junheng & Co before me.

511
00:31:58,342 --> 00:32:01,242
I really don't know if you are comforting me or criticizing me.

512
00:32:03,022 --> 00:32:05,563
But, you are very empathetic and know how to comfort others.

513
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,760
Perhaps, it was right for Wu Jun to hire you.

514
00:32:08,152 --> 00:32:10,922
If you work harder, you will surpass Bao Rui and Yu Fei.

515
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:26,642
(Lawyer Cheng, can we schedule a meeting after my dad's affair is settled?)

516
00:32:27,453 --> 00:32:28,496
Boss,

517
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,602
Dong Min asked if we could meet.

518
00:32:30,933 --> 00:32:32,202
Remember to record it down.

519
00:32:54,664 --> 00:32:57,922
Did I disturb your work for asking you out?

520
00:32:58,189 --> 00:32:59,430
Today is fine.

521
00:32:59,568 --> 00:33:01,562
How is your mom? Is she doing okay?

522
00:33:02,461 --> 00:33:04,630
I feel like she's pretending to be okay every day.

523
00:33:04,971 --> 00:33:06,842
She must be afraid that I'll be upset.

524
00:33:07,701 --> 00:33:09,222
But, the more she does this,

525
00:33:09,302 --> 00:33:11,362
the more I feel useless.

526
00:33:14,302 --> 00:33:15,861
The deceased has passed away.

527
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,591
Those who are left behind should live well.

528
00:33:19,118 --> 00:33:20,282
Yes.

529
00:33:21,229 --> 00:33:22,620
For the sake of my mother,

530
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:25,099
I have to pull myself together.

531
00:33:29,701 --> 00:33:33,082
Actually, I saw Qian Heng once half a month ago.

532
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:34,758
At that time,

533
00:33:34,901 --> 00:33:38,211
my father entrusted him to handle the divorce.

534
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,660
As lawyers, we have rules.

535
00:33:41,923 --> 00:33:44,163
We can't just reveal the client's privacy like that.

536
00:33:44,343 --> 00:33:45,643
I know.

537
00:33:47,149 --> 00:33:49,220
I know he's a great lawyer.

538
00:33:49,822 --> 00:33:51,742
He has his own principles when it comes to work.

539
00:33:52,561 --> 00:33:56,171
But, I always feel like he will explain something to me afterward.

540
00:33:56,679 --> 00:33:58,546
My boss is like that.

541
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:01,549
He keeps a lot of things to himself. He doesn't like to talk about them.

542
00:34:05,303 --> 00:34:06,984
I'm not afraid of you laughing at me.

543
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,470
Actually,

544
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,842
I've been chasing after him for over two years.

545
00:34:13,823 --> 00:34:17,474
I always thought that no matter what, he would at least

546
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:19,888
care a little bit

547
00:34:20,069 --> 00:34:21,541
about my feelings,

548
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,482
or feel a little bit of my presence.

549
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,371
But now, it turns out

550
00:34:28,141 --> 00:34:29,602
I was just being delusional.

551
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:38,397
I envy you.

552
00:34:40,152 --> 00:34:41,452
Do you know

553
00:34:41,669 --> 00:34:43,042
that someone as aloof as him

554
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:46,164
would actually send me a message when I went to see you,

555
00:34:46,282 --> 00:34:47,632
asking me not to bother you.

556
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:53,282
What kind of charm do you have

557
00:34:54,077 --> 00:34:55,240
to make him so infatuated?

558
00:34:55,406 --> 00:34:56,462
Not really.

559
00:34:56,542 --> 00:34:57,842
Not really.

560
00:34:59,502 --> 00:35:01,442
My boss is just a typical man who is too direct

561
00:35:01,523 --> 00:35:03,213
and he can be unintentionally hurtful at times.

562
00:35:03,237 --> 00:35:04,642
Don't be too upset.

563
00:35:05,527 --> 00:35:06,916
I was just teasing you.

564
00:35:09,542 --> 00:35:10,842
Wishing you both the best.

565
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,402
As for me,

566
00:35:18,695 --> 00:35:20,402
after being childish for so long,

567
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,482
it's time to become a grown-up.

568
00:35:25,502 --> 00:35:27,172
I wish myself the best.

569
00:35:50,718 --> 00:35:51,882
Don't move.

570
00:35:52,181 --> 00:35:53,262
I'm warning you.

571
00:35:53,343 --> 00:35:54,733
It's best to stay away from me.

572
00:35:55,249 --> 00:35:56,362
You...

573
00:36:10,392 --> 00:36:11,562
Don't move.

574
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,962
Don't move.

575
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,562
Close your eyes.

576
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,162
I must be crazy.

577
00:37:10,529 --> 00:37:12,710
Why does this dog look more and more like Cheng Yao?

578
00:37:48,812 --> 00:37:50,802
Boss, you're back?

579
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,399
Why is Wei Zhen Tian wearing an eye mask? Come here.

580
00:38:03,624 --> 00:38:06,402
Its expression is too silly. It's a mental pollution for me.

581
00:38:09,244 --> 00:38:10,675
Let's go. Get back to the room.

582
00:38:14,515 --> 00:38:16,282
Rest well. Don't move.

583
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,830
Is there anything Dong Min wants you to convey?

584
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:25,602
No.

585
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,962
We're just chatting casually.

586
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,390
Um, boss.

587
00:38:35,723 --> 00:38:37,240
You don't like Dong Min.

588
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:39,682
Just reject her directly. It's a good thing for her.

589
00:38:40,301 --> 00:38:42,398
But, now that the case has already ended

590
00:38:42,479 --> 00:38:44,082
and her father has passed away,

591
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:46,549
as a friend,

592
00:38:46,637 --> 00:38:48,278
have you considered telling her

593
00:38:48,382 --> 00:38:49,882
your reason for hiding it from her?

594
00:38:49,984 --> 00:38:51,495
Why do I have to explain?

595
00:38:51,707 --> 00:38:54,288
At least let her know that you didn't intentionally hurt her.

596
00:38:54,656 --> 00:38:55,878
The result has already been cast.

597
00:38:55,902 --> 00:38:57,962
Does it matter if I was intentional or not?

598
00:38:58,992 --> 00:39:00,292
Yes.

599
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,642
It's important to her.

600
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,281
Cheng Yao.

601
00:39:04,479 --> 00:39:07,042
Giving false hope is the biggest harm.

602
00:39:07,301 --> 00:39:09,757
If a person deludes herself and lives in her own world,

603
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:11,467
do I still have to add fuel to the fire?

604
00:39:14,244 --> 00:39:16,525
When are you going to treat me to a meal as you promised?

605
00:39:17,312 --> 00:39:19,028
I've been busy lately. So...

606
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:20,940
According to Article 472 of the Civil Code,

607
00:39:21,021 --> 00:39:24,172
- the offeree's acceptance is effective... - Fine. Let's go now.

608
00:39:25,261 --> 00:39:26,561
What do you want to eat?

609
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,970
Boss. How about we go to a different restaurant?

610
00:39:50,462 --> 00:39:53,342
This is already the best restaurant within my expected price range

611
00:39:53,423 --> 00:39:55,042
in terms of cost-effectiveness.

612
00:39:55,864 --> 00:39:58,438
To consider your budget, I actually used this word: cost-effectiveness.

613
00:39:58,462 --> 00:39:59,602
I...

614
00:40:02,712 --> 00:40:05,124
(It's quite a burden to be taken care of by you.)

615
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,740
Hurry up.

616
00:40:09,102 --> 00:40:10,652
What about you order instead?

617
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,700
What about this?

618
00:40:15,902 --> 00:40:17,483
This page and this page,

619
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,741
two portions for each dish.

620
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:21,710
Okay, sir.

621
00:40:21,862 --> 00:40:22,902
Can you finish eating?

622
00:40:22,997 --> 00:40:24,437
Just take away what we can't finish.

623
00:40:32,254 --> 00:40:34,277
Since it will take some time for the food to be served,

624
00:40:34,301 --> 00:40:36,451
why don't we memorize some legal codes?

625
00:40:41,155 --> 00:40:42,935
Or, we can talk about life.

626
00:40:43,056 --> 00:40:44,356
What do you want to talk about?

627
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:49,282
Why did you choose to study law?

628
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,202
Do you have faith in the law?

629
00:40:52,904 --> 00:40:54,204
Because I made a mistake.

630
00:40:54,512 --> 00:40:55,862
A mistake?

631
00:40:56,867 --> 00:40:57,979
On the day of filling out my college application,

632
00:40:58,003 --> 00:40:59,602
I stayed up all night playing games.

633
00:40:59,948 --> 00:41:01,497
In the morning, my eyes were a bit blurry.

634
00:41:01,521 --> 00:41:03,241
I thought I had applied for a French major.

635
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,411
When I registered,

636
00:41:04,532 --> 00:41:06,452
I realized that I had signed up for law studies.

637
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,422
Back then, I loved French art films. So, I wanted to learn French.

638
00:41:10,556 --> 00:41:13,876
But now, looking back, it was completely unnecessary to major in French.

639
00:41:14,007 --> 00:41:15,897
Why? Because there are limited job opportunities

640
00:41:15,921 --> 00:41:17,722
for people who specialize in less commonly spoken languages?

641
00:41:17,746 --> 00:41:18,746
No.

642
00:41:19,181 --> 00:41:21,341
It's because I've watched too many French films,

643
00:41:21,422 --> 00:41:23,782
so I remember all the lines and pronunciations.

644
00:41:23,952 --> 00:41:25,736
I passed C2 after studying for a year and a half only.

645
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,200
And now I can communicate with the French without any issues.

646
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,122
And, studying law has made me more practical.

647
00:41:31,439 --> 00:41:35,319
I now find being a lawyer and solving real-life issues quite interesting.

648
00:41:35,462 --> 00:41:36,971
So, it's a happy accident I guess.

649
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:38,612
You see,

650
00:41:38,827 --> 00:41:40,051
when we're young,

651
00:41:40,132 --> 00:41:41,612
we often can't see ourselves clearly.

652
00:41:42,073 --> 00:41:43,313
When I was choosing my major,

653
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,602
how would I know I was so smart?

654
00:41:57,332 --> 00:41:59,186
So, you also stayed up all night playing games.

655
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:00,370
Are you even listening to me?

656
00:42:00,463 --> 00:42:01,763
What game did you play?

657
00:42:03,343 --> 00:42:04,502
Honu God.

658
00:42:04,732 --> 00:42:06,002
I also played that.

659
00:42:06,144 --> 00:42:08,104
Tanoti. Do you know Tanoti?

660
00:42:08,232 --> 00:42:09,232
What did you use?

661
00:42:09,344 --> 00:42:10,644
I used a mage.

662
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,225
It's difficult using a mage.

663
00:42:12,413 --> 00:42:15,155
Of course. That's why it's interesting to beat the game with a mage.

664
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,084
In the early stages, it's definitely a solo fight.

665
00:42:17,108 --> 00:42:19,803
No matter how good your equipment is, you can be taken out with one move.

666
00:42:19,827 --> 00:42:22,770
But in the later stages, one area of effect attack can make you a god.

667
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,880
So, you're this competitive even at playing games.

668
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:31,042
Among the people I know, very few can beat the game with a mage.

669
00:42:31,374 --> 00:42:33,862
You really are the best gamer among lawyers

670
00:42:33,942 --> 00:42:35,602
and the best lawyer among gamers.

671
00:42:37,249 --> 00:42:39,862
By the way, the songs in it are also really good.

672
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,562
I even made a customized album.

673
00:42:42,273 --> 00:42:44,202
Do you know what is this genre called?

674
00:42:44,413 --> 00:42:45,522
Death metal, right?

675
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:48,108
For the first time,

676
00:42:48,189 --> 00:42:51,059
I feel like it's a bit of a fateful thing to become your assistant.

677
00:42:51,339 --> 00:42:52,739
It's worth having a drink for that.

678
00:42:55,129 --> 00:42:58,569
If you really like them, I have a few rare vinyl records in my villa.

679
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,980
I'll give them to you.

680
00:43:03,173 --> 00:43:04,894
I don't even have a decent record player.

681
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:06,582
If you give it to me, it's just a waste.

682
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:07,931
But, if you like it,

683
00:43:08,016 --> 00:43:09,442
it's not a waste.

684
00:43:12,121 --> 00:43:15,442
I didn't expect that sometimes you can be quite cute, boss.

685
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,671
How about we just memorize the law?

686
00:43:39,661 --> 00:43:40,762
The dish has been served.
