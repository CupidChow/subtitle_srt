1
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:38,882
(My Boss)

2
00:01:39,918 --> 00:01:42,316
(Episode 30)

3
00:01:42,462 --> 00:01:45,692
(Yao Yao, happy 100th-day anniversary.)

4
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:15,602
Senior.

5
00:02:15,683 --> 00:02:16,882
You're here.

6
00:02:17,026 --> 00:02:18,465
- Sorry for letting you wait.   - Sit.

7
00:02:18,546 --> 00:02:19,962
Why isn't Lawyer Qian here?

8
00:02:20,606 --> 00:02:21,881
Sit down and let's talk about it.

9
00:02:21,984 --> 00:02:23,204
Sure.

10
00:02:27,322 --> 00:02:31,302
Well, Qian ordered me to treat you to dinner.

11
00:02:32,249 --> 00:02:34,012
Oh, I bought you a bouquet.

12
00:02:34,093 --> 00:02:35,482
I don't know if you like it or not.

13
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:37,601
I do, it's very pretty. Thank you.

14
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,881
How was it?

15
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:41,198
Did Qian trouble you?

16
00:02:41,782 --> 00:02:42,982
No.

17
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:46,242
I was the one who didn't know his preferences and gave him the wrong gift.

18
00:02:46,353 --> 00:02:47,644
I became a laughing stock.

19
00:02:47,725 --> 00:02:49,753
Not at all. No one will laugh at you.

20
00:02:49,834 --> 00:02:51,545
He is just

21
00:02:51,735 --> 00:02:53,362
a dull guy who doesn't know anything.

22
00:02:54,488 --> 00:02:56,002
Let me tell you, Yi Ran.

23
00:02:56,272 --> 00:02:57,510
If you find a boyfriend in the future,

24
00:02:57,591 --> 00:02:59,021
you mustn't find someone like him.

25
00:02:59,386 --> 00:03:00,505
Got it.

26
00:03:00,633 --> 00:03:02,012
Lawyer Qian reminded me

27
00:03:02,093 --> 00:03:04,699
that Junheng & Co has a high requirement for its partner.

28
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,392
I need to put in all my effort in my work.

29
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:09,402
I don't have time to date anyone.

30
00:03:09,483 --> 00:03:11,161
I'm glad to hear you say that.

31
00:03:11,343 --> 00:03:14,042
Let me use water instead of wine

32
00:03:14,222 --> 00:03:15,842
and hope we can work well together.

33
00:03:16,006 --> 00:03:18,835
In the future, we will be Junheng & Co's iron triangle.

34
00:03:19,502 --> 00:03:21,402
- To a successful partnership.   - Do your best.

35
00:04:08,322 --> 00:04:09,542
(Qian Heng.)

36
00:04:09,894 --> 00:04:12,122
(I have finally come to be by your side.)

37
00:04:12,506 --> 00:04:14,026
(Why do you still not notice me?)

38
00:04:31,334 --> 00:04:32,554
Come in.

39
00:04:34,368 --> 00:04:35,588
Lawyer Qian,

40
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,569
I just got a few cases but I don't know Junheng & Co's style.

41
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:40,936
Do you have time? Let's discuss it together.

42
00:04:41,851 --> 00:04:42,998
I still need to go out and work later.

43
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,630
Find Wu Jun if you need anything.

44
00:04:45,788 --> 00:04:47,322
All right. I won't disturb you, then.

45
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:48,759
Remember to rest.

46
00:04:48,973 --> 00:04:51,004
You were so busy that you missed my welcome meal last night.

47
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,221
I was busy indeed.

48
00:05:09,121 --> 00:05:12,322
Hello. Can I do color photocopies here?

49
00:05:12,441 --> 00:05:14,042
Yes. Let me help you.

50
00:05:14,168 --> 00:05:15,388
Thank you.

51
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:20,882
Is it tough for you to work with Qian Heng?

52
00:05:21,048 --> 00:05:23,162
Not bad. It is good training for me.

53
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,712
It's fine. I've known him for many years.

54
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:27,621
He has been the same since university.

55
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:30,391
He is a very cold person and has a sharp tongue. Right?

56
00:05:30,661 --> 00:05:31,881
However, he's not a bad person.

57
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,746
He is capable

58
00:05:33,894 --> 00:05:35,524
but he has a stubborn personality.

59
00:05:35,605 --> 00:05:37,422
He doesn't know how to accommodate others.

60
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:38,832
He is too firm.

61
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,321
So, it's normal for young girls like you

62
00:05:40,402 --> 00:05:41,951
to not get used to his personality.

63
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,642
If he says anything blunt,

64
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:45,200
please forgive him and don't take it to heart.

65
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,282
Don't worry, Lawyer Liang. We are all professionals.

66
00:05:47,365 --> 00:05:48,585
There's no such problem.

67
00:05:49,441 --> 00:05:52,362
Qian Heng has trained you well. I was worrying about nothing.

68
00:05:52,917 --> 00:05:54,305
Do you know him well?

69
00:05:54,386 --> 00:05:56,172
For example, the restaurant he likes

70
00:05:56,253 --> 00:05:57,914
or the gym he frequents.

71
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:00,631
Why do you ask this question suddenly?

72
00:06:01,511 --> 00:06:04,162
Think of it as me wanting to assimilate into Junheng & Co.

73
00:06:04,472 --> 00:06:06,481
Why don't I treat the colleagues to dinner tonight

74
00:06:06,562 --> 00:06:08,002
to know everyone better?

75
00:06:09,292 --> 00:06:11,322
Lawyer Qian is simple.

76
00:06:11,558 --> 00:06:13,962
He has high requirements for his work

77
00:06:14,566 --> 00:06:15,657
and always forgets to eat when he's busy.

78
00:06:15,738 --> 00:06:18,600
(Cheng Yao, you better watch your boyfriend closely.)

79
00:06:18,705 --> 00:06:21,202
(Every time he came to our side, he would stop and stare for so long.)

80
00:06:21,328 --> 00:06:22,988
(I got PTSD from that.)

81
00:06:23,308 --> 00:06:26,442
(I am sad. I thought he was checking to see if I was doing a good job.)

82
00:06:26,574 --> 00:06:28,469
(You are excellent and capable.)

83
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,282
(I'm sure you can get along with him just fine.)

84
00:06:34,471 --> 00:06:35,691
It's done.

85
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,281
I still have work to do tonight so I can't join you.

86
00:06:39,392 --> 00:06:40,612
Let me treat you next time.

87
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,099
Sure.

88
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:44,803
Let's talk again.

89
00:06:56,963 --> 00:07:01,282
(Liang Yi Ran)

90
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,562
(Sneak shots of the boss' happy moments)

91
00:08:09,602 --> 00:08:12,242
Trying to compete with me when you are just a rookie lawyer?

92
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,322
Are you watching "Nothing But You"?

93
00:08:36,535 --> 00:08:37,755
Lawyer Liang?

94
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:40,122
It's all right. Just watch.

95
00:08:40,841 --> 00:08:42,906
I know the male lead of this drama.

96
00:08:42,987 --> 00:08:44,713
I have some autographed pictures of him at home.

97
00:08:44,794 --> 00:08:47,016
If you like him, I can give it to you next time.

98
00:08:47,184 --> 00:08:48,522
Thank you, Lawyer Liang.

99
00:08:49,335 --> 00:08:50,964
You are Wang Lu, right?

100
00:08:52,604 --> 00:08:54,721
Lawyer Liang, you are like a God.

101
00:08:54,854 --> 00:08:56,797
You can already remember all our names so soon.

102
00:08:56,878 --> 00:08:58,802
I'm not as great as you described.

103
00:08:58,949 --> 00:09:00,578
I do mix up your names sometimes.

104
00:09:00,754 --> 00:09:02,383
For example, I saw

105
00:09:02,464 --> 00:09:05,933
the young and pretty assistant lawyer in Qian Heng's group.

106
00:09:06,114 --> 00:09:07,562
She is...

107
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:09,788
Lawyer Liang, are you talking about Cheng Yao?

108
00:09:10,691 --> 00:09:12,332
She is quite pretty indeed.

109
00:09:12,445 --> 00:09:14,154
Otherwise, she wouldn't be so lucky.

110
00:09:14,612 --> 00:09:17,481
Yes. I remember now. Her name is Cheng Yao.

111
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,968
Qian Heng always tells me

112
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:22,002
to take care of his cute little girlfriend.

113
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:27,069
What? Cheng Yao and Lawyer Qian are in a relationship?

114
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:29,830
Don't you know that?

115
00:09:30,096 --> 00:09:32,327
Sorry. I didn't know they hadn't made it public yet.

116
00:09:32,408 --> 00:09:34,268
I didn't consider this enough.

117
00:09:34,349 --> 00:09:36,682
Help me keep a secret and don't tell anyone.

118
00:10:04,655 --> 00:10:06,565
Don't you think the atmosphere's weird today?

119
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:09,798
Someone called me the lady boss at the reception.

120
00:10:09,885 --> 00:10:11,072
That's weird.

121
00:10:11,192 --> 00:10:13,309
Reasonably speaking, both of you are quite reserved.

122
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,820
No one should find out.

123
00:10:15,307 --> 00:10:17,362
Even so, you are his girlfriend.

124
00:10:17,426 --> 00:10:18,786
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

125
00:10:20,402 --> 00:10:23,682
Wang Lu, do you think the rumor is true about Cheng Yao?

126
00:10:24,235 --> 00:10:26,561
Think about it. How long has it been since she joined?

127
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,272
However, she can take charge of such a big trust case.

128
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,534
Why do you think it is?

129
00:10:29,619 --> 00:10:32,187
But I heard that her sister is also a capable lawyer.

130
00:10:32,268 --> 00:10:34,000
Perhaps she is also capable.

131
00:10:34,182 --> 00:10:35,573
Capable?

132
00:10:36,241 --> 00:10:37,600
I heard her sister, Cheng Xi,

133
00:10:37,681 --> 00:10:39,791
is also in a relationship with Lawyer Wu.

134
00:10:40,136 --> 00:10:41,237
In my opinion,

135
00:10:41,318 --> 00:10:43,547
both of them must be doing the same thing.

136
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,046
Besides, her status is different

137
00:10:46,127 --> 00:10:47,802
from normal employees like us.

138
00:10:47,936 --> 00:10:49,325
She is different now.

139
00:10:50,015 --> 00:10:52,726
It's no use for people to work hard.

140
00:10:52,807 --> 00:10:54,642
You still need to look pretty.

141
00:10:55,841 --> 00:10:58,192
Cheng Yao, do you need an assistant?

142
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,521
Leave pouring water to me.

143
00:11:00,658 --> 00:11:02,722
Water? Cheng Yao likes to drink coffee.

144
00:11:02,817 --> 00:11:04,442
No need. I can do it myself.

145
00:11:05,807 --> 00:11:07,282
- Are you all right?   - Sorry.

146
00:11:07,364 --> 00:11:08,794
Sorry, Cheng Yao.

147
00:11:08,987 --> 00:11:11,722
You can't even do a good job flattering the lady boss.

148
00:11:11,908 --> 00:11:15,552
Everyone in Junheng & Co is lining up to flatter her.

149
00:11:15,752 --> 00:11:17,662
Interns like you two won't get a chance.

150
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,050
Are you done?

151
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:22,579
Lawyer Liang.

152
00:11:23,135 --> 00:11:25,525
Wang Lu, you should apologize to Cheng Yao.

153
00:11:27,432 --> 00:11:29,187
Although I just joined Junheng & Co,

154
00:11:29,268 --> 00:11:31,480
I know what I should do as a partner.

155
00:11:31,815 --> 00:11:33,761
I think the atmosphere at Junheng & Co should be harmonious.

156
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:36,171
I also believe Cheng Yao and Lawyer Qian's relationship

157
00:11:36,252 --> 00:11:38,202
won't affect her work and capability.

158
00:11:38,393 --> 00:11:40,982
The team's purpose is to face our enemies and not fight among ourselves.

159
00:11:41,229 --> 00:11:44,598
From now on, I don't want to hear anything that harms Lawyer Cheng.

160
00:11:47,757 --> 00:11:48,837
Cheng Yao.

161
00:11:48,918 --> 00:11:50,149
Come to the office with me.

162
00:12:00,081 --> 00:12:01,351
Sorry, Lawyer Liang.

163
00:12:01,432 --> 00:12:04,162
My personal matter has affected everyone's work.

164
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,722
Relax. Have some water.

165
00:12:06,947 --> 00:12:08,070
I'm not like Qian Heng

166
00:12:08,151 --> 00:12:10,322
who is a leader that only wants my staff to work.

167
00:12:12,542 --> 00:12:13,743
Sorry.

168
00:12:13,824 --> 00:12:15,843
Do you mind me describing your boyfriend like that?

169
00:12:18,961 --> 00:12:21,592
We wanted to make it public when our relationship had stabilized.

170
00:12:21,999 --> 00:12:24,653
I never expected the situation just now.

171
00:12:25,813 --> 00:12:27,254
My mind was blank.

172
00:12:27,335 --> 00:12:28,555
Thankfully, you were around.

173
00:12:30,471 --> 00:12:32,042
How did you two get together?

174
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,880
Don't you have many work

175
00:12:33,984 --> 00:12:35,374
as a rookie lawyer?

176
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:39,782
It's a long story.

177
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,802
I never expected to be in a relationship with Qian Heng.

178
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:45,322
Perhaps it's a situation of

179
00:12:45,996 --> 00:12:48,787
the more you hate a person, the more the person will get closer to you.

180
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:51,557
It's probably the Murphy's Law.

181
00:12:56,402 --> 00:12:57,622
But Lawyer Liang,

182
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,537
you are so much better than what others say.

183
00:12:59,618 --> 00:13:02,151
You are capable, forgiving, and understanding.

184
00:13:02,886 --> 00:13:05,780
I hope to learn from you if I have a chance in the future.

185
00:13:09,601 --> 00:13:12,151
What a coincidence. I just came to Junheng & Co.

186
00:13:12,328 --> 00:13:14,758
I'm lacking a capable assistant.

187
00:13:15,112 --> 00:13:17,382
If you sincerely want to learn from me,

188
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,282
why don't you come to my team?

189
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:22,391
Then, you and Qian Heng can avoid suspicions better.

190
00:13:22,574 --> 00:13:23,882
After all, this matter

191
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:25,442
has caused a stir in the company.

192
00:13:28,928 --> 00:13:30,148
I will consider it.

193
00:13:31,535 --> 00:13:32,755
I'm leaving first.

194
00:13:39,301 --> 00:13:40,521
Ridiculous.

195
00:13:56,318 --> 00:13:57,589
Why are you at my home?

196
00:13:57,776 --> 00:13:59,486
Why didn't you tell me beforehand?

197
00:13:59,567 --> 00:14:01,117
My phone ran out of battery.

198
00:14:02,111 --> 00:14:03,271
Let me get you a charger.

199
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,600
There's no need.

200
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,470
It gives me a moment of peace.

201
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:08,821
You don't know. There were so many bees

202
00:14:08,902 --> 00:14:10,533
buzzing around my ears today.

203
00:14:12,002 --> 00:14:13,222
Bees?

204
00:14:13,532 --> 00:14:16,962
Who noticed this pretty flower in our family?

205
00:14:17,676 --> 00:14:20,991
My relationship with Qian Heng has been found out by my colleagues.

206
00:14:25,976 --> 00:14:27,282
How did they find out?

207
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,598
- I don't know.   - What did they say?

208
00:14:30,882 --> 00:14:34,162
They called me the lady boss and some other things.

209
00:14:35,722 --> 00:14:38,151
That was what they used to call me.

210
00:14:38,518 --> 00:14:40,558
As long as they start calling you the lady boss,

211
00:14:40,685 --> 00:14:42,836
your capability will be stripped.

212
00:14:44,534 --> 00:14:45,754
Promise me.

213
00:14:45,913 --> 00:14:47,302
Don't give up on your work.

214
00:14:49,271 --> 00:14:51,142
I'm sure it's difficult for you right now

215
00:14:51,418 --> 00:14:53,561
but you must hold on. Understand?

216
00:14:53,697 --> 00:14:55,846
Don't worry, Cheng Xi. I won't give up.

217
00:14:57,135 --> 00:14:58,633
I think

218
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,482
that I might need to sacrifice something.

219
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,282
I'm wondering if I should go to another team

220
00:15:05,386 --> 00:15:06,802
and not stay at Lawyer Qian's anymore.

221
00:15:07,393 --> 00:15:09,587
However, doing this means

222
00:15:09,668 --> 00:15:12,082
I need to give up on the trust case that I spent a lot of time preparing.

223
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:13,438
Do you think this is a good decision?

224
00:15:16,561 --> 00:15:18,002
Is there

225
00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:20,462
a new female lawyer at Junheng & Co?

226
00:15:21,031 --> 00:15:22,251
Her name is Liang Yi Ran.

227
00:15:22,424 --> 00:15:23,774
I heard she is your junior.

228
00:15:24,574 --> 00:15:25,794
I know her.

229
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,580
She has become a partner at such a young age

230
00:15:28,912 --> 00:15:30,465
so she is capable.

231
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,200
Her style is also bold.

232
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:37,281
Forget about that. Let's talk about the trust case.

233
00:15:37,518 --> 00:15:39,082
I took a long time to prepare it.

234
00:15:39,407 --> 00:15:41,442
I feel reluctant to give it away to other people.

235
00:15:42,882 --> 00:15:45,517
Even if you lose the case, you still have your capability.

236
00:15:45,598 --> 00:15:46,962
We can just find other cases.

237
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:53,571
Can you lend me your computer?

238
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,881
I want to study Lawyer Liang's working style.

239
00:15:56,062 --> 00:15:57,293
Of course.

240
00:15:57,746 --> 00:16:00,712
My younger sister can make a killing anywhere she goes.

241
00:16:01,902 --> 00:16:03,132
Let me make some food for you.

242
00:16:05,623 --> 00:16:06,843
Where is Wei Zhen Tian?

243
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:13,521
Bao Rui, you've worked hard today.

244
00:16:13,602 --> 00:16:16,282
- It's all right.   - Rest early and don't go out having fun.

245
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:18,595
Boss.

246
00:16:20,369 --> 00:16:22,799
There's one thing that I'm not sure if I should tell you or not.

247
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:25,036
If it's something normal that you hesitate about, don't tell me.

248
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,549
Not even when it's about Cheng Yao?

249
00:16:31,316 --> 00:16:32,563
What happened to her?

250
00:16:33,848 --> 00:16:36,128
I don't know. The group sent a text.

251
00:16:36,215 --> 00:16:38,860
They said there were rumors in the company about you dating Cheng Yao.

252
00:16:40,002 --> 00:16:42,162
- Who spread it?   - I don't know.

253
00:16:42,277 --> 00:16:43,562
I, Tan Ying, and Yu Fei.

254
00:16:43,642 --> 00:16:44,915
The three of us will never do this.

255
00:16:44,996 --> 00:16:46,721
Who dares to spread it even if you allow us?

256
00:16:46,801 --> 00:16:48,654
If you let me spread it... If I...

257
00:16:48,735 --> 00:16:50,565
Anyway, I know about it now.

258
00:16:51,201 --> 00:16:52,911
I can't reach Cheng Yao as well.

259
00:16:57,961 --> 00:17:01,642
(Sorry, the number you are calling is engaged.)

260
00:17:01,738 --> 00:17:02,958
You can't call her, right?

261
00:17:03,472 --> 00:17:04,762
Actually, I can manage things here alone.

262
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,362
Why don't I book an early flight for you?

263
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:08,842
However, you'll only reach the firm earliest by tomorrow afternoon.

264
00:17:09,384 --> 00:17:11,134
Bao Rui, help me reserve a car.

265
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,380
All right.

266
00:17:16,782 --> 00:17:18,173
Who spread this rumor?

267
00:17:30,241 --> 00:17:32,642
Cheng Yao, are you all right?

268
00:17:33,795 --> 00:17:35,876
Some people can't see you achieving success.

269
00:17:35,957 --> 00:17:38,342
If you have something on your mind, don't keep it inside and tell us.

270
00:17:42,902 --> 00:17:44,722
- Come here.   - Why are you back?

271
00:17:44,842 --> 00:17:46,062
Come with me.

272
00:17:47,504 --> 00:17:48,724
Yu Fei.

273
00:17:49,512 --> 00:17:50,732
Everyone,

274
00:17:51,402 --> 00:17:52,922
since everyone already found out about it,

275
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,268
I don't have to hide it anymore.

276
00:17:54,882 --> 00:17:57,072
Cheng Yao and I are lovers.

277
00:17:57,488 --> 00:18:00,122
We didn't announce it because we haven't been together for a long time.

278
00:18:00,339 --> 00:18:01,962
However, I'll tell everyone now

279
00:18:02,102 --> 00:18:04,613
that Cheng Yao is my girlfriend.

280
00:18:07,601 --> 00:18:09,670
Oh, one more thing I want to tell everyone.

281
00:18:10,274 --> 00:18:11,634
She didn't pursue me.

282
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,042
I was the one who pursued her.

283
00:18:13,222 --> 00:18:15,881
There has been no favoritism between us.

284
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:17,961
She also hadn't done anything that oversteps her boundaries.

285
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:19,549
I like her first.

286
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:23,282
I spent a long time to obtain this luck.

287
00:18:25,247 --> 00:18:28,122
If anyone suspects me of biasing her,

288
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,682
you can come and verify with me anytime.

289
00:18:30,801 --> 00:18:32,106
But from today onwards,

290
00:18:32,215 --> 00:18:33,762
I don't want to see Cheng Yao

291
00:18:33,897 --> 00:18:35,607
bear any pressure from the rumors.

292
00:18:40,814 --> 00:18:41,895
Everyone, don't worry.

293
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:44,361
Since joining Junheng & Co, I've been putting work

294
00:18:44,441 --> 00:18:45,899
above my personal life.

295
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,246
I never thought about using this relationship

296
00:18:48,332 --> 00:18:49,802
to gain any benefit for myself.

297
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,120
I understand that all of you will have that idea.

298
00:18:52,293 --> 00:18:56,243
To avoid any suspicions, I will hand over my trust case to Bao.

299
00:18:57,607 --> 00:19:01,002
If you can come out with a tutorial about dating the boss,

300
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,340
it'll be better.

301
00:19:04,642 --> 00:19:06,002
Lawyer Qian, does it mean

302
00:19:06,082 --> 00:19:09,961
I can cancel that weird office romance talk?

303
00:19:10,113 --> 00:19:11,482
Of course. You can cancel it.

304
00:19:11,593 --> 00:19:13,143
However, it won't affect your work.

305
00:19:13,661 --> 00:19:15,602
- Thank you, boss.   - Don't worry!

306
00:19:16,402 --> 00:19:18,362
- Thank you, boss!   - Long live the boss!

307
00:19:21,872 --> 00:19:24,072
Oh, since we've announced our relationship,

308
00:19:24,191 --> 00:19:26,300
I want to transfer to Lawyer Liang's team.

309
00:19:26,882 --> 00:19:28,552
I will do my best to hand over my work.

310
00:19:29,193 --> 00:19:30,413
All right.

311
00:19:32,402 --> 00:19:34,090
From today onwards, Lawyer Qian's charm

312
00:19:34,171 --> 00:19:35,922
has achieved new heights in my opinion.

313
00:19:36,379 --> 00:19:38,482
If he doesn't have a sharp tongue usually

314
00:19:38,562 --> 00:19:40,242
and I just joined the company,

315
00:19:40,322 --> 00:19:42,471
who would be able to stop us?

316
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,276
I have to thank his sharp tongue.

317
00:19:45,222 --> 00:19:47,408
(Great. How moving.)

318
00:19:47,489 --> 00:19:49,161
Why are you crying? Look at Bao Rui.

319
00:19:49,282 --> 00:19:50,833
Why are you crying?

320
00:19:50,999 --> 00:19:52,389
Isn't this a good thing?

321
00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:55,629
(It was so suffering for me.)

322
00:19:56,567 --> 00:19:58,687
(I don't have to keep this a secret anymore!)

323
00:19:58,786 --> 00:20:01,270
You didn't see anything, right? Greet everyone, come.

324
00:20:17,823 --> 00:20:19,043
Lawyer Qian.

325
00:20:20,751 --> 00:20:23,221
Thank you for helping Cheng Yao yesterday.

326
00:20:24,172 --> 00:20:25,521
How rare is this?

327
00:20:25,687 --> 00:20:27,322
It's your first time thanking me.

328
00:20:27,472 --> 00:20:29,372
It seems like you quite like Cheng Yao.

329
00:20:32,281 --> 00:20:34,151
I see. This is your type.

330
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:38,060
Well, Cheng Yao is young and pretty.

331
00:20:39,782 --> 00:20:41,571
She is not just young and pretty.

332
00:20:42,295 --> 00:20:43,925
She is excellent in every aspect.

333
00:20:44,213 --> 00:20:46,413
I've never shown her any favoritism at work.

334
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:47,921
She has her current achievement

335
00:20:48,087 --> 00:20:49,598
because she worked hard for it.

336
00:20:50,671 --> 00:20:53,602
Junheng & Co is a large firm. Can no one be compared to her?

337
00:20:55,542 --> 00:20:56,762
In my heart,

338
00:20:57,077 --> 00:20:58,297
there is no one.

339
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,242
Lawyer Liang,

340
00:21:03,376 --> 00:21:05,836
- I came to you because...   - I understand.

341
00:21:06,155 --> 00:21:07,999
I already received Cheng Yao's letter.

342
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,552
I thought you wouldn't agree to it at first.

343
00:21:09,633 --> 00:21:10,762
(Work Transfer Request)

344
00:21:12,215 --> 00:21:14,242
I will support every decision she makes.

345
00:21:14,986 --> 00:21:17,465
Don't worry. I will take good care of her.

346
00:21:17,546 --> 00:21:20,201
I am also a female lawyer. I'll bring her along when I work outside.

347
00:21:20,281 --> 00:21:22,042
Then, you'll be at ease, right?

348
00:21:22,129 --> 00:21:23,349
Thank you so much.

349
00:21:37,889 --> 00:21:39,109
Cheng Yao.

350
00:21:39,648 --> 00:21:42,272
I was the one who led you in your first case, right?

351
00:21:43,691 --> 00:21:46,081
I feel reluctant to see you leave so suddenly.

352
00:21:46,641 --> 00:21:49,242
No matter where you go, remember that you are a part of Glory and Wealth.

353
00:21:49,921 --> 00:21:52,282
Do well. Don't embarrass Glory and Wealth.

354
00:21:52,418 --> 00:21:55,377
Yes. Cheng Yao has been on our team since he joined the company.

355
00:21:55,632 --> 00:21:57,842
Now that she is leaving, I feel a little reluctant.

356
00:21:58,046 --> 00:21:59,355
The firm is so big.

357
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,126
Where are you moving to? Can we still meet in the future?

358
00:22:02,207 --> 00:22:03,477
Where are you moving to?

359
00:22:08,362 --> 00:22:09,522
Stop measuring.

360
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:11,742
She will be moving 3.5 meters further at least.

361
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,180
I wondered where she would be moving to.

362
00:22:15,261 --> 00:22:16,722
Just 3.5 meters.

363
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:23,175
I feel that things are not what they seem like.

364
00:22:23,318 --> 00:22:27,258
Do you think this is all an act by Liang Yi Ran?

365
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:28,708
I don't think so.

366
00:22:29,395 --> 00:22:30,955
If that's the case, she is overestimating me.

367
00:22:31,663 --> 00:22:34,332
It's all right. I can go and study there.

368
00:22:42,215 --> 00:22:43,484
I'm here to report in, Lawyer Liang.

369
00:22:43,881 --> 00:22:45,101
Welcome.

370
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:48,921
They are two assistant lawyers I brought in from my previous team.

371
00:22:49,055 --> 00:22:50,495
They are slightly older than you.

372
00:22:50,576 --> 00:22:51,922
Don't feel pressured.

373
00:22:52,233 --> 00:22:55,073
This is Cheng Yao. She is a new member of our team.

374
00:22:55,202 --> 00:22:56,750
Both of you must take good care of her.

375
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:59,882
This is an order Lawyer Qian gave me in person.

376
00:23:06,431 --> 00:23:07,911
- Welcome.   - Hello, Lawyer Cheng.

377
00:23:07,992 --> 00:23:09,568
- Hello. - Hello.

378
00:23:09,687 --> 00:23:10,907
Hello.

379
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,762
- Wang, it's done.   - Thank you.

380
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,402
This is already done.

381
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:27,819
All right.

382
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,372
Lawyer Zhang,

383
00:23:46,621 --> 00:23:48,212
do you need any help?

384
00:23:48,953 --> 00:23:50,543
You can just call me Zhang.

385
00:23:50,742 --> 00:23:52,622
I'll be done with my work soon.

386
00:23:52,735 --> 00:23:53,955
Just take a break.

387
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:56,120
There's no need to be polite with me.

388
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,430
I was tortured in Lawyer Qian's team every day

389
00:23:58,511 --> 00:23:59,731
so I have high endurance.

390
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:04,997
Let me do these contracts for you.

391
00:24:05,173 --> 00:24:07,242
No need, Lawyer Cheng. I can do it myself.

392
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,360
Miss Cheng,

393
00:24:09,585 --> 00:24:11,015
you are our lady boss.

394
00:24:11,156 --> 00:24:13,911
Just leave these trivial matters to us.

395
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:17,520
It's really fine.

396
00:24:17,601 --> 00:24:19,962
I used to arrange hundreds of pages of evidence in the past.

397
00:24:20,534 --> 00:24:22,445
You arranged evidence yourself?

398
00:24:22,635 --> 00:24:24,016
I am also a lawyer.

399
00:24:24,935 --> 00:24:27,964
I hope all of you still treat me like a normal lawyer.

400
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,187
Miss Cheng,

401
00:24:33,392 --> 00:24:35,711
these are the legal opinions I just arranged.

402
00:24:35,792 --> 00:24:39,103
If you have time, can you give me some suggestions?

403
00:24:41,778 --> 00:24:43,768
The way you think is similar to Lawyer Qian.

404
00:24:43,957 --> 00:24:46,386
What Lawyer Qian thinks is the standard answer.

405
00:24:52,162 --> 00:24:53,671
Wang, you wrote it well.

406
00:24:54,673 --> 00:24:56,264
I should be learning from you instead.

407
00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:00,269
Gosh, I'm so happy

408
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:02,642
to receive your motivation and praise.

409
00:25:02,832 --> 00:25:04,052
Thank you.

410
00:25:24,882 --> 00:25:26,102
Come in.

411
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:28,830
Lawyer Liang,

412
00:25:29,132 --> 00:25:31,440
my colleagues are shy about asking me for help

413
00:25:31,632 --> 00:25:33,322
but I have adaptability.

414
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:36,639
So just let me know if you need any help.

415
00:25:38,791 --> 00:25:41,902
I do have many things that need help.

416
00:25:42,305 --> 00:25:44,058
However, I'm afraid of wasting your potential.

417
00:25:44,139 --> 00:25:45,442
No way.

418
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,340
Work is all the same to me.

419
00:25:50,229 --> 00:25:51,788
My assistant lawyers are busy.

420
00:25:51,908 --> 00:25:53,809
They have no time to gather evidence for me.

421
00:25:55,072 --> 00:25:56,292
Leave it to me.

422
00:25:56,675 --> 00:25:57,801
Thank you so much.

423
00:25:57,882 --> 00:25:59,631
I thought you wouldn't want to scan documents.

424
00:26:02,141 --> 00:26:03,702
Gathering evidence and scanning.

425
00:26:03,814 --> 00:26:05,284
Can you finish them in three days?

426
00:26:07,936 --> 00:26:09,325
I'll submit it tonight.

427
00:26:09,958 --> 00:26:11,178
Sure.

428
00:26:24,846 --> 00:26:27,197
Both of you, let's have a meeting in the meeting room.

429
00:26:27,402 --> 00:26:28,622
All right.

430
00:26:59,642 --> 00:27:01,082
- Come in.   - Boss.

431
00:27:05,074 --> 00:27:06,234
Stop looking.

432
00:27:06,315 --> 00:27:08,442
Cheng Yao is going to the State Administration for Market Regulation.

433
00:27:08,641 --> 00:27:09,861
I wasn't looking.

434
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:14,738
Tan Ying asked me to tell you that you shouldn't worry about Cheng Yao.

435
00:27:15,023 --> 00:27:16,256
Even if Lawyer Liang is exploiting her,

436
00:27:16,337 --> 00:27:17,836
she wouldn't be as bad as you previously.

437
00:27:17,964 --> 00:27:19,184
She has gotten used to it.

438
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:24,622
If there's nothing else, I'll be leaving.

439
00:27:25,368 --> 00:27:26,588
Wait.

440
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:31,278
Isn't it an intern's job to get files at

441
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:32,760
the State Administration for Market Regulation?

442
00:27:32,857 --> 00:27:35,992
- Why did she go?   - She said it was some key evidence.

443
00:27:36,343 --> 00:27:38,359
Maybe Lawyer Liang is afraid that an intern might make a mistake

444
00:27:38,447 --> 00:27:39,629
so she asked Cheng Yao instead.

445
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,840
(Cheng Yao, there's a document at Nancheng.)

446
00:28:03,922 --> 00:28:05,282
(Can you go and pick it up?)

447
00:28:05,362 --> 00:28:07,349
(On your way back, go to the color printing shop)

448
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:09,992
(and pick up the documents the company ordered to be distributed.)

449
00:28:10,073 --> 00:28:12,482
(Help buy some coffee for the team as well.)

450
00:28:24,358 --> 00:28:25,762
(Is it too troublesome?)

451
00:28:30,922 --> 00:28:32,142
(No problem.)

452
00:28:43,241 --> 00:28:44,602
What's that smell?

453
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,162
Are you back?

454
00:28:46,504 --> 00:28:48,984
The steak I was cooking got burnt.

455
00:28:49,065 --> 00:28:50,523
I couldn't move it at all.

456
00:28:50,674 --> 00:28:51,804
This is an expensive steak

457
00:28:51,885 --> 00:28:53,222
but the quality is bad.

458
00:28:53,303 --> 00:28:54,523
I won't buy it again.

459
00:28:56,326 --> 00:28:58,837
You need to defrost a steak before you cook it.

460
00:28:59,303 --> 00:29:00,523
What do you mean?

461
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,919
What? It means it has to be defrosted.

462
00:29:03,031 --> 00:29:04,932
All right. Put it there and let me do it.

463
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,098
I asked a restaurant to deliver our food.

464
00:29:07,595 --> 00:29:10,321
I heard that someone ran around the whole day.

465
00:29:10,402 --> 00:29:11,791
So, you need more rest.

466
00:29:11,872 --> 00:29:13,762
Come. Sit down. Let me massage your feet for you.

467
00:29:16,184 --> 00:29:17,933
I do feel a little tired.

468
00:29:18,271 --> 00:29:20,342
- Be careful.   - However,

469
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,199
it was much better than when I just joined someone's team.

470
00:29:23,338 --> 00:29:26,102
Have you forgotten about me running around in the rain?

471
00:29:27,635 --> 00:29:29,631
I sincerely apologize to you

472
00:29:29,846 --> 00:29:31,197
for my behavior in the past.

473
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:32,574
I'm willing to accept any punishment.

474
00:29:33,441 --> 00:29:35,058
What I mean is that

475
00:29:35,182 --> 00:29:37,252
I could even complete your tasks

476
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:39,164
so I can also complete Lawyer Liang's tasks.

477
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:41,226
I can't let others think

478
00:29:41,307 --> 00:29:43,739
I'm useless after I'm in a relationship with you.

479
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:48,402
Besides, aren't you going out to work tomorrow night?

480
00:29:49,001 --> 00:29:50,369
So, I want to do more work today

481
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:52,202
and have dinner with you tomorrow night.

482
00:29:53,338 --> 00:29:54,922
My girlfriend is too hardworking,

483
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,339
but you've worked too hard.

484
00:29:56,888 --> 00:29:59,638
I still need to work outstation often for a few different cases.

485
00:30:00,237 --> 00:30:02,482
Why don't I transfer you back from Liang Yi Ran's team

486
00:30:02,627 --> 00:30:04,361
- so we can go together?   - That won't do.

487
00:30:04,572 --> 00:30:06,360
I just joined Lawyer Liang's team today.

488
00:30:06,573 --> 00:30:07,803
I can't break my promise.

489
00:30:08,922 --> 00:30:11,601
All right. Tell me whenever you are facing problems.

490
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:13,162
Don't worry.

491
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,082
(100 days together with Qian Heng tomorrow)

492
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:22,570
100 days together with Qian Heng tomorrow.

493
00:30:22,651 --> 00:30:24,802
- What is that?   - What do you mean?

494
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:26,842
It's just a reminder alarm.

495
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,582
It's reminding us that we've been together for 100 days.

496
00:30:31,432 --> 00:30:33,572
How do you think I've performed?

497
00:30:35,924 --> 00:30:37,282
You did well.

498
00:30:37,654 --> 00:30:39,962
- 99 points.   - So high?

499
00:30:40,393 --> 00:30:42,401
Can you tell me why I'm missing a point?

500
00:30:42,606 --> 00:30:44,122
The perfect score is 2,000.

501
00:30:46,661 --> 00:30:48,051
2,000?

502
00:30:48,915 --> 00:30:50,895
How can I get 2,000 points?

503
00:30:53,263 --> 00:30:55,414
I want to drink orange juice right now.

504
00:30:55,734 --> 00:30:56,954
I'll get it immediately.

505
00:31:01,145 --> 00:31:02,365
Done.

506
00:31:13,798 --> 00:31:15,018
Here you go.

507
00:31:18,033 --> 00:31:19,128
How is it?

508
00:31:19,209 --> 00:31:21,002
You already know how to use the blender now.

509
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,011
Are you complaining about me now?

510
00:31:26,752 --> 00:31:27,972
Sorry.

511
00:31:29,295 --> 00:31:31,445
My work was scheduled previously.

512
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,101
However, I didn't forget about our 100th-day anniversary.

513
00:31:35,362 --> 00:31:37,309
We'll celebrate together while having dinner tomorrow.

514
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:38,610
All right?

515
00:31:48,094 --> 00:31:49,775
How is this nice? It's not clean at all.

516
00:31:49,856 --> 00:31:51,126
Why don't I blend it some more?

517
00:32:04,765 --> 00:32:05,985
(Do they look nice?)

518
00:32:08,277 --> 00:32:09,285
(Yes.)

519
00:32:09,541 --> 00:32:10,838
(They are simple and have great design sense.)

520
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,718
(They suit Lawyer Qian's temperament.)

521
00:32:20,761 --> 00:32:22,522
Are you choosing a gift for Lawyer Qian?

522
00:32:24,122 --> 00:32:25,452
Good morning, Lawyer Liang.

523
00:32:25,533 --> 00:32:27,270
It's fine. It's not working hours yet.

524
00:32:27,351 --> 00:32:28,571
Just be casual.

525
00:32:29,392 --> 00:32:32,117
Are you going to buy the necklace for Lawyer Qian?

526
00:32:35,239 --> 00:32:36,998
Today is our 100th day together

527
00:32:37,133 --> 00:32:38,724
so I want to choose a gift.

528
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:41,764
It's an important day indeed.

529
00:32:42,882 --> 00:32:46,141
But don't you think the price of that necklace is not suitable

530
00:32:46,222 --> 00:32:47,562
for an elite like Lawyer Qian?

531
00:32:50,041 --> 00:32:53,202
I'm sure the intention is more important than the price when giving a gift.

532
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,962
Did Qian Heng tell you that?

533
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,920
Are you a fool?

534
00:32:57,056 --> 00:32:59,510
He wouldn't say something honest to hurt you

535
00:32:59,591 --> 00:33:00,902
because you are his girlfriend.

536
00:33:01,632 --> 00:33:02,705
When you are a student,

537
00:33:02,786 --> 00:33:05,429
giving a small gift in this price range can show your sincerity

538
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:08,042
but after joining the society, it'll be too childish

539
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:09,842
if you still give such gifts.

540
00:33:11,151 --> 00:33:14,833
That is why men all love young women regardless of their age

541
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,469
because young women are naive and won't think too much.

542
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,790
Their thoughts can easily be grasped.

543
00:33:19,871 --> 00:33:22,121
However, a person will soon get bored of things

544
00:33:22,256 --> 00:33:23,476
that are too transparent.

545
00:33:23,655 --> 00:33:25,875
That is why young people need to grow.

546
00:33:29,621 --> 00:33:31,493
I'm not giving Qian Heng gifts to please him.

547
00:33:31,574 --> 00:33:35,042
I just want to make it a little ceremonious for this moment in our lives.

548
00:33:38,015 --> 00:33:40,086
Cheng Yao, come with me.

549
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,189
Do you like this handbag?

550
00:33:51,142 --> 00:33:53,102
After you use a real branded bag,

551
00:33:53,183 --> 00:33:54,322
you will realize

552
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,639
why the top brands are expensive.

553
00:33:57,027 --> 00:33:59,562
Whether you are working outside or socializing,

554
00:33:59,714 --> 00:34:01,322
you will feel its convenience.

555
00:34:01,488 --> 00:34:02,879
Just like the outfit you are wearing now.

556
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,802
If I were a client, I wouldn't choose you.

557
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,080
It's all right.

558
00:34:06,153 --> 00:34:10,042
You can use this occasion to ask Qian Heng to buy you one.

559
00:34:10,463 --> 00:34:11,903
I don't think it's necessary.

560
00:34:12,014 --> 00:34:14,004
You don't know. It is a marketing tactic.

561
00:34:14,292 --> 00:34:15,722
If you package yourself,

562
00:34:15,832 --> 00:34:18,722
those who want to buy it will still do so even if you are highly-priced.

563
00:34:19,011 --> 00:34:20,262
From what I know about Qian Heng,

564
00:34:20,386 --> 00:34:23,231
I'm sure he wants Junheng & Co's image to be classier.

565
00:34:23,464 --> 00:34:26,322
It's fine. It hasn't been long since you joined this industry.

566
00:34:26,403 --> 00:34:28,382
It's normal if you can't feel these things.

567
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,948
It hasn't been long since I joined this industry indeed

568
00:34:32,425 --> 00:34:34,027
but Qian Heng has been telling us

569
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,797
that Junheng & Co prioritizes one's capability

570
00:34:35,878 --> 00:34:37,361
and not meaningless packaging.

571
00:34:37,503 --> 00:34:39,781
You can ask him if you don't agree with it.

572
00:34:41,988 --> 00:34:43,428
I won't disagree with it.

573
00:34:43,509 --> 00:34:44,938
I was just testing you.

574
00:34:45,282 --> 00:34:47,282
It is very important for a young lawyer

575
00:34:47,425 --> 00:34:49,921
to resist temptation and his or her impulsive nature.

576
00:34:50,113 --> 00:34:51,762
After a few days of observation,

577
00:34:51,873 --> 00:34:54,182
I already have a basic recognition of your ability.

578
00:34:55,035 --> 00:34:56,961
I have an international trust contract here.

579
00:34:57,128 --> 00:35:00,002
Help me circle the parts that need to be amended. Can you do it?

580
00:35:00,319 --> 00:35:03,229
This will help you get familiar with the international trust field quickly.

581
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,080
Everything is in English.

582
00:35:05,161 --> 00:35:07,242
To wear the crown, one must first bear its responsibility.

583
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,298
I'm prioritizing you and giving you this opportunity to learn.

584
00:35:14,095 --> 00:35:15,606
No problem, I will work hard.

585
00:35:25,808 --> 00:35:29,882
(Qian Heng, Depart from Jiangcheng Airport)

586
00:36:10,322 --> 00:36:11,521
My dear, Cheng Yao.

587
00:36:11,601 --> 00:36:13,962
There's a delivery at the reception. I brought it here for you.

588
00:36:14,282 --> 00:36:15,762
Did you order all these?

589
00:36:15,925 --> 00:36:17,762
Can you eat so much?

590
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,561
You know your stuff. This dessert has gone viral recently.

591
00:36:20,641 --> 00:36:21,881
It's difficult to buy it.

592
00:36:22,011 --> 00:36:24,221
This restaurant too. It's very delicious.

593
00:36:25,007 --> 00:36:26,227
Let me take a look at this.

594
00:36:27,282 --> 00:36:30,002
Can you eat this alone? Not even four people can finish this.

595
00:36:30,077 --> 00:36:31,707
Fruits with imperial plating.

596
00:36:33,174 --> 00:36:34,239
You are living a good life.

597
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,019
Enough. Move aside.

598
00:36:39,362 --> 00:36:42,162
Even if you are busy until you have no time to reply to my texts,

599
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:44,299
I still can't let you starve.

600
00:36:44,686 --> 00:36:46,207
Do you need to attract people's attention?

601
00:36:46,347 --> 00:36:48,602
You are the girlfriend of Junheng & Co's boss.

602
00:36:48,744 --> 00:36:50,023
You can no longer keep a low profile.

603
00:36:53,481 --> 00:36:54,882
I feel a little too.

604
00:36:55,221 --> 00:36:56,451
I feel lonely and cold.

605
00:37:01,161 --> 00:37:02,401
Go back to work.

606
00:37:02,481 --> 00:37:04,072
We will celebrate when we get home.

607
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,620
Sure.

608
00:37:08,402 --> 00:37:09,660
Lawyer Qian is so romantic.

609
00:37:09,847 --> 00:37:11,067
Yu Fei, learn from him.

610
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,000
I won't order delivery for you.

611
00:37:13,166 --> 00:37:14,486
I will only cook for you.

612
00:37:14,575 --> 00:37:15,795
Come on.

613
00:37:17,644 --> 00:37:19,316
One is a refrigerator and the other is a freezer.

614
00:37:20,521 --> 00:37:22,351
All right. Give it to me.

615
00:37:22,935 --> 00:37:24,155
Go to work.

616
00:37:25,078 --> 00:37:26,828
Do you hear that? She's talking about all of you.

617
00:37:27,094 --> 00:37:28,314
Don't you have work to do?

618
00:37:29,765 --> 00:37:30,985
Don't you have work to do?

619
00:37:32,644 --> 00:37:33,722
Boss,

620
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:35,641
I don't want to disturb you two

621
00:37:35,941 --> 00:37:37,910
but tonight's flight has been booked.

622
00:37:38,146 --> 00:37:40,176
Should we discuss work first?

623
00:37:44,001 --> 00:37:45,482
It feels cold suddenly.

624
00:37:45,628 --> 00:37:46,937
Who turned on the air con?

625
00:37:52,889 --> 00:37:54,109
All right, I'm coming immediately.

626
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,911
I need to report on my work.

627
00:37:57,562 --> 00:37:58,782
Go.

628
00:38:06,477 --> 00:38:07,697
Lawyer Liang.

629
00:38:09,682 --> 00:38:12,341
The contract you gave me in the morning has 128 pages.

630
00:38:12,613 --> 00:38:13,762
Since it's all in English,

631
00:38:13,842 --> 00:38:16,362
I need to translate and label them.

632
00:38:16,792 --> 00:38:20,082
Do you think I can show you the first half?

633
00:38:20,183 --> 00:38:21,602
Next morning, the remaining half will be...

634
00:38:21,683 --> 00:38:23,002
The contract has a Chinese version.

635
00:38:23,278 --> 00:38:24,602
It doesn't need to be translated.

636
00:38:25,807 --> 00:38:27,122
You didn't tell me.

637
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,704
Why didn't you ask me?

638
00:38:30,785 --> 00:38:32,842
Professional international contracts have Chinese versions.

639
00:38:32,922 --> 00:38:34,142
Don't you know that?

640
00:38:36,734 --> 00:38:38,642
It's all right. I won't blame you for being inexperienced.

641
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,626
I will send you the digital version now.

642
00:38:40,707 --> 00:38:42,281
Verify it with the digital version.

643
00:38:42,449 --> 00:38:45,062
After that, send the digital version and the printed contract to me.

644
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,081
When you're done, hurry and get some clients.

645
00:38:48,262 --> 00:38:50,573
There's an event by the Family Law Association this afternoon.

646
00:38:51,206 --> 00:38:52,646
A law firm like Junheng & Co

647
00:38:52,727 --> 00:38:54,518
doesn't need to get clients, right?

648
00:38:54,927 --> 00:38:57,802
I'm worried that they won't be good enough for Junheng & Co.

649
00:38:58,315 --> 00:38:59,915
The firm's standard is one thing

650
00:38:59,996 --> 00:39:02,282
but it is another thing to train you with this.

651
00:39:02,613 --> 00:39:04,903
Finding clients is an important skill for a lawyer.

652
00:39:04,984 --> 00:39:06,143
It is a good cycle.

653
00:39:06,246 --> 00:39:07,722
It'll be a pity if you miss it.

654
00:39:09,441 --> 00:39:12,280
All right. I'll depart immediately after I'm done with the contract.

655
00:39:12,375 --> 00:39:13,595
All right.

656
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:08,602
(I have no choice but to give the present later.)

657
00:40:09,604 --> 00:40:11,195
(If I run faster,)

658
00:40:11,682 --> 00:40:13,722
(I might be able to arrive home for dinner.)

659
00:40:23,245 --> 00:40:24,492
First, let's talk about this.

660
00:40:24,573 --> 00:40:26,162
After the Civil Code is amended,

661
00:40:26,253 --> 00:40:29,001
everyone knows that the original Marriage Law becomes invalid.

662
00:40:29,081 --> 00:40:31,081
Today, we will also talk about

663
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:33,202
the marriage and family section of the Civil Code.

664
00:40:33,292 --> 00:40:37,242
I believe this question is on most of our audience members' minds.

665
00:40:37,386 --> 00:40:41,322
First of all, let's talk about the issue of the divorce cooling-off period.

666
00:41:34,144 --> 00:41:36,895
I heard some noise and guessed you were still here.

667
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,401
You still have a flight to catch later so don't tire yourself out.

668
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:40,779
Have a safe trip.

669
00:41:58,908 --> 00:42:01,041
All right. I'll see you later. I'll go and greet other people.

670
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:03,402
Our law firm is called Junheng & Co.

671
00:42:04,299 --> 00:42:06,402
Our firm has many ace lawyers

672
00:42:06,502 --> 00:42:08,202
like Qian Heng, Wu Jun, and Liang Yi Ran.

673
00:42:08,282 --> 00:42:11,362
Our firm is in charge of domestic proceedings.

674
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:16,631
If you want a divorce, inherit assets, or various...

675
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,680
Cheng Yao?

676
00:42:28,495 --> 00:42:29,715
Lawyer Li.

677
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:31,609
Is Junheng & Co having trouble recently?

678
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:33,912
Why do they let a girl find clients alone?

679
00:42:34,775 --> 00:42:37,566
Gender has nothing to do with finding clients.

680
00:42:38,456 --> 00:42:39,676
Sorry.

681
00:42:40,202 --> 00:42:42,702
Cheng Yao, if you are free, we can have a meal together.

682
00:42:42,783 --> 00:42:44,372
You can also visit Jincheng & Co.

683
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,389
I don't think today works.

684
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:49,002
Let's do it next time. Sorry.

685
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:59,260
Qian Heng!

686
00:43:41,287 --> 00:43:42,507
Happy 100th-day anniversary.
