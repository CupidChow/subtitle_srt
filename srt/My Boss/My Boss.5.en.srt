1
00:01:35,724 --> 00:01:38,802
(My Boss)

2
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:44,341
(Episode 5: It looks like she is a bit useful.)

3
00:01:44,898 --> 00:01:46,362
(Yes, just a bit.)

4
00:02:02,732 --> 00:02:04,002
500 yuan?

5
00:02:05,247 --> 00:02:06,876
Don't you think it's too little too?

6
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:09,977
No. I mean you're selling your body.

7
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:12,623
- But you haven't even hired her yet.   - Lower your voice.

8
00:02:13,975 --> 00:02:15,062
Can you keep it down?

9
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,000
Should I get you a megaphone?

10
00:02:18,146 --> 00:02:21,002
The most important thing is that you need to keep this a secret for me.

11
00:02:21,157 --> 00:02:24,282
You're my best friend. I only told you.

12
00:02:24,755 --> 00:02:26,282
What if this gets out?

13
00:02:26,572 --> 00:02:27,882
I'll be socially dead.

14
00:02:27,999 --> 00:02:29,665
How am I supposed to stay at Junheng?

15
00:02:35,973 --> 00:02:37,803
The most painful thing is

16
00:02:38,093 --> 00:02:40,362
I can't remember anything.

17
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,240
I mean how could I not remember anything?

18
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:45,642
And I can't ask her this.

19
00:02:46,957 --> 00:02:48,242
Don't laugh.

20
00:02:50,198 --> 00:02:51,398
I'm telling you, Qian.

21
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,621
Seriously.

22
00:02:53,093 --> 00:02:54,372
I'm warning you.

23
00:02:54,452 --> 00:02:57,162
Before I make any progress with Cheng Xi,

24
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:59,722
you should be nicer to Cheng Yao.

25
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:02,962
At this critical moment, don't give me any more trouble.

26
00:03:03,076 --> 00:03:05,282
It's a good time to cleanse your bad reputation in the industry too.

27
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:06,439
No.

28
00:03:07,052 --> 00:03:10,682
If I show favoritism to Cheng Yao, it really shows I look down on women.

29
00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:12,918
True respect is to treat everyone equally

30
00:03:13,007 --> 00:03:15,087
- and let her speak with her abilities.   - All right. Whatever.

31
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,360
Everything you said is right.

32
00:03:19,292 --> 00:03:20,602
How is your friend's progress?

33
00:03:20,973 --> 00:03:22,192
What does it have to do with you?

34
00:03:22,693 --> 00:03:24,162
I'm just caring about you.

35
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:25,642
So, who did you invite?

36
00:03:25,734 --> 00:03:27,054
Before your insomnia gets cured,

37
00:03:27,182 --> 00:03:28,522
you can't have her gone?

38
00:03:29,554 --> 00:03:31,405
- You...   - Don't make that face anymore.

39
00:03:31,486 --> 00:03:33,707
Besides me, do you have any other friends? Come on. Tell me.

40
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,840
Okay.

41
00:03:37,096 --> 00:03:39,402
Let me take a look at my WeChat Moments.

42
00:03:39,501 --> 00:03:40,662
I wonder how many of those wanting to know

43
00:03:40,743 --> 00:03:42,202
Wu Jun's embarrassing stories are there.

44
00:03:42,283 --> 00:03:44,746
We're in this situation, and you're still posting on WeChat Moments?

45
00:03:44,871 --> 00:03:45,881
Posting on WeChat Moments?

46
00:03:45,996 --> 00:03:49,625
- Wu Jun, 500 yuan.   - Don't post on WeChat Moments.

47
00:03:49,706 --> 00:03:51,586
- Don't pull me.   - Don't tap it.

48
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:53,835
Be careful. I may accidentally tap it.

49
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:54,916
No way!

50
00:04:04,572 --> 00:04:05,713
Tan Ying.

51
00:04:06,428 --> 00:04:10,194
Do these two bosses of us have any special quirks?

52
00:04:10,593 --> 00:04:12,187
I'm used to it. They love and hate each other at the same time.

53
00:04:12,268 --> 00:04:13,388
It's their daily routine.

54
00:04:13,532 --> 00:04:15,922
Do you know about Lawyer Qian's

55
00:04:16,351 --> 00:04:17,762
secrets or hobbies?

56
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:22,088
Why? Do you want to gossip about them?

57
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:25,842
Are you sure you want to gossip about the boss? It's dangerous.

58
00:04:28,693 --> 00:04:30,643
(I should seek wealth through risk.)

59
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,922
(I can't keep being manipulated by him.)

60
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,322
(His behavior is too suspicious.)

61
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,562
(If I can investigate him and get a hold of his embarrassing things,)

62
00:05:00,631 --> 00:05:02,482
(I can get out of his control earlier, right?)

63
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,922
It's been half an hour.

64
00:05:09,751 --> 00:05:11,541
Could it be constipation?

65
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,040
(Your remedy isn't working.)

66
00:05:24,233 --> 00:05:26,298
(I've been sitting on the toilet for half an hour already)

67
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:28,250
(and still no sign of sleep.)

68
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,551
(Maybe you should stay longer.)

69
00:05:39,771 --> 00:05:41,522
(Are you playing with me?)

70
00:06:00,766 --> 00:06:01,848
(Oh my.)

71
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:04,082
(It's 40 minutes already.)

72
00:06:04,502 --> 00:06:06,213
(It's almost pickled.)

73
00:06:06,838 --> 00:06:08,802
(It must be that he's usually too hot-tempered.)

74
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,362
(It turns out that even the seemingly all-powerful boss)

75
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:13,842
(has his own difficulties.)

76
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,722
(Come on, keep it up.)

77
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,722
What's the situation in this restroom?

78
00:06:45,803 --> 00:06:47,023
Do you like it?

79
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,215
I saw you stayed in there for a while.

80
00:06:49,296 --> 00:06:52,457
So, I got you a fluffy toilet seat cushion.

81
00:06:52,555 --> 00:06:53,635
It should be more comfortable.

82
00:06:53,778 --> 00:06:55,658
How about that? I'm very considerate, right?

83
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,570
Then, tell me what "Come on, keep it up" means.

84
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,861
These are the imported pills I asked someone to buy from abroad.

85
00:07:02,942 --> 00:07:04,182
It's useful for constipation.

86
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,340
Constipation?

87
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,721
Boss. You don't have to feel embarrassed about this matter.

88
00:07:09,802 --> 00:07:11,241
You work so hard all the time,

89
00:07:11,337 --> 00:07:13,086
plus your sleep is irregular.

90
00:07:13,635 --> 00:07:15,882
So having constipation occasionally is normal.

91
00:07:17,622 --> 00:07:19,762
Food and supplements will help.

92
00:07:20,882 --> 00:07:22,442
The price is 125 yuan.

93
00:07:22,578 --> 00:07:24,442
Well, you're so idle. Let's start working overtime this week.

94
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:25,977
And this one,

95
00:07:26,302 --> 00:07:27,651
not counted as repayment of debt.

96
00:07:42,238 --> 00:07:43,838
(I don't believe it.)

97
00:07:44,368 --> 00:07:45,962
(You caught me last time.)

98
00:07:46,058 --> 00:07:47,609
(This time, I'll catch you too.)

99
00:07:47,892 --> 00:07:50,642
(I want to see what other secrets you have.)

100
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,562
(It's so late)

101
00:08:41,643 --> 00:08:44,122
(and it doesn't look like his outfit is for working in the office.)

102
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:45,922
(He looks hurried.)

103
00:08:46,118 --> 00:08:47,988
(It looks like something's really up.)

104
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,002
No.

105
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,223
No way.

106
00:09:19,627 --> 00:09:20,768
Oh my gosh.

107
00:09:24,127 --> 00:09:25,676
I won't be discovered, right?

108
00:09:28,616 --> 00:09:29,864
I'm exhausted.

109
00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:40,482
Boss. What a coincidence.

110
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:41,676
What are you doing?

111
00:09:41,757 --> 00:09:43,645
I'm jogging. And you?

112
00:09:43,811 --> 00:09:45,642
Jogging in pajamas at night?

113
00:09:46,812 --> 00:09:48,322
Who said I can't?

114
00:09:50,311 --> 00:09:52,636
After all, exercise is life. I can't sleep.

115
00:09:52,756 --> 00:09:54,042
So, I came down to run a few laps.

116
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:57,362
All right. Then, I'll keep running for 10 km. Let's go together.

117
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,500
No need.

118
00:09:58,581 --> 00:10:00,122
I've already reached my exercise quota.

119
00:10:00,251 --> 00:10:02,162
You go ahead, boss. Be safe.

120
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,762
You should stop these behaviors immediately tomorrow.

121
00:10:05,941 --> 00:10:07,341
What behaviors?

122
00:10:07,468 --> 00:10:09,722
Decorating the toilet, stalking, and snooping into my privacy.

123
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,362
You make me sound like a pervert.

124
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,279
These are all my most sincere concerns.

125
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,402
I don't need them.

126
00:10:18,483 --> 00:10:20,402
Cheng Yao. No matter how long you can stay at Junheng,

127
00:10:20,488 --> 00:10:21,952
you are still Junheng's lawyer for now.

128
00:10:22,106 --> 00:10:23,389
Although your time isn't worth as much money as mine,

129
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,162
it isn't worthless either.

130
00:10:25,337 --> 00:10:26,842
Don't waste it on these things.

131
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,511
Boss, well...

132
00:10:28,888 --> 00:10:30,764
I'm doing this just to make you happy.

133
00:10:30,874 --> 00:10:33,522
After you're happy, maybe I can get involved in a case.

134
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,320
I've finished reviewing the case files.

135
00:10:35,418 --> 00:10:36,802
I've also collected all the information.

136
00:10:36,955 --> 00:10:39,504
I really want to do something more valuable.

137
00:10:44,532 --> 00:10:46,082
I'm going back, boss.

138
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,571
Meet the client at two o'clock tomorrow afternoon.

139
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:50,262
I can participate in the case now?

140
00:10:50,343 --> 00:10:52,762
It's better than seeing you wandering around in front of me.

141
00:10:54,015 --> 00:10:56,276
Thank you, boss. I'll definitely work hard.

142
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,324
Boss, if you have any work, you can go back to the office first.

143
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,015
When the client arrives, I'll notify you.

144
00:11:40,465 --> 00:11:42,517
No need. I never wait for people.

145
00:11:42,598 --> 00:11:45,242
If she's late once, she won't have a chance to work with me again.

146
00:11:45,717 --> 00:11:47,760
You haven't been to a good law firm before.

147
00:11:47,876 --> 00:11:49,562
You're used to pampering clients.

148
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:51,902
From now on, try to change those bad habits

149
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:53,634
you've picked up from other law firms.

150
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:56,009
Lawyer Qian, your client is here.

151
00:11:59,132 --> 00:12:01,642
Hi. Sorry for the delay. There was some traffic.

152
00:12:02,609 --> 00:12:04,507
This is my assistant, Cheng Yao.

153
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:05,835
She has already signed the NDA

154
00:12:05,921 --> 00:12:07,472
and will be working on this case with us.

155
00:12:07,757 --> 00:12:08,757
Please sit.

156
00:12:09,052 --> 00:12:10,052
Okay.

157
00:12:21,431 --> 00:12:22,803
(Bai Xing Meng?)

158
00:12:22,921 --> 00:12:24,392
That's Li Yan.

159
00:12:30,647 --> 00:12:34,037
This is all the information we have collected. You two can take a look.

160
00:12:36,448 --> 00:12:38,447
Based on the materials and the recordings you provided,

161
00:12:38,621 --> 00:12:41,393
there are still a few details we need to confirm with you.

162
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:43,725
After your ex-husband, Xu Jun, returned to China,

163
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:46,682
he founded Tuantuan Online on March 18, 2019.

164
00:12:46,896 --> 00:12:49,882
But, you two didn't register your marriage

165
00:12:50,049 --> 00:12:52,288
at the Civil Affairs Department until April 5, 2019, right?

166
00:12:52,484 --> 00:12:53,988
That's right.

167
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,882
So, Tuantuan Online belongs to Xu Jun as property before marriage.

168
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,122
Wait a minute.

169
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:04,647
We two got married on March 2, 2019 in Las Vegas, USA.

170
00:13:04,767 --> 00:13:06,248
For us who register our marriage overseas,

171
00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:07,638
does it have any effect domestically?

172
00:13:08,012 --> 00:13:09,092
I have evidence.

173
00:13:09,172 --> 00:13:11,029
We recorded the wedding day on video.

174
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:14,672
If you want the marriage status registered abroad to be effective in China,

175
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,562
it must first be notarized by a notary public,

176
00:13:16,643 --> 00:13:18,012
then certified by the Secretary of State,

177
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,362
and finally sent to the Chinese Embassy in the US for authentication.

178
00:13:20,468 --> 00:13:22,609
You just registered your marriage in Las Vegas.

179
00:13:22,731 --> 00:13:24,121
Even if you held a wedding,

180
00:13:24,492 --> 00:13:26,872
it won't be effective domestically without the authentication process.

181
00:13:27,297 --> 00:13:29,642
Why is it so complicated?

182
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:33,413
People like Xu Jun, who have lived in the US for more than 10 years,

183
00:13:33,493 --> 00:13:35,122
must know this, right?

184
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:37,816
Yes.

185
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,322
So, I was calculated after all.

186
00:13:50,878 --> 00:13:52,223
Before he and I knew each other,

187
00:13:52,359 --> 00:13:54,682
he had no connections in the entertainment industry.

188
00:13:54,888 --> 00:13:57,700
After we got married, Tuantuan Online was

189
00:13:57,812 --> 00:13:59,270
the crystallization of our love in my heart.

190
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:00,668
I really hope this company

191
00:14:00,749 --> 00:14:02,859
can be well-established in the entertainment industry.

192
00:14:03,173 --> 00:14:05,522
So, I used my resources

193
00:14:05,603 --> 00:14:08,322
to pull in a lot of investments and also promote many projects.

194
00:14:08,422 --> 00:14:09,742
You know that, right?

195
00:14:09,893 --> 00:14:11,869
Aren't the sales of film and television rights for adapting those novels

196
00:14:11,953 --> 00:14:13,341
all based on my connections?

197
00:14:13,421 --> 00:14:15,794
I ran around from one company to another and talked to each one.

198
00:14:15,883 --> 00:14:17,434
Now, you're telling me

199
00:14:17,905 --> 00:14:20,014
it has nothing to do with me?

200
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,882
Miss Bai. Do I need to remind you that I get paid by the hour?

201
00:14:28,797 --> 00:14:29,896
It's okay.

202
00:14:30,093 --> 00:14:32,002
We will pay for your time.

203
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:33,172
That's how it is.

204
00:14:33,364 --> 00:14:34,522
Money has a price.

205
00:14:34,622 --> 00:14:36,022
But, my time is priceless.

206
00:14:36,172 --> 00:14:39,802
Even if you get everyone's sympathy, it won't change any facts.

207
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:43,644
So now, I need you to focus on the case and extract useful information,

208
00:14:43,756 --> 00:14:46,042
so we can have ideas to trace his hidden assets.

209
00:14:48,845 --> 00:14:49,865
Good.

210
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:51,729
You're right.

211
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,042
Miss Bai, don't worry.

212
00:15:05,123 --> 00:15:06,625
Lawyer Qian is a very professional lawyer.

213
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:08,802
He will definitely help you get back the rights you deserve.

214
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,857
What I care about has never been these material things.

215
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,841
Although you have encountered some bad things,

216
00:15:15,939 --> 00:15:19,218
I believe your fans are all supporting you from behind.

217
00:15:19,855 --> 00:15:21,637
Your plays are getting more and more popular.

218
00:15:21,733 --> 00:15:24,162
Those who have wronged you will all regret it.

219
00:15:25,213 --> 00:15:26,882
Have you seen my drama?

220
00:15:27,172 --> 00:15:28,802
I watch Ling Yao Strategy every week.

221
00:15:28,883 --> 00:15:30,102
You act really well.

222
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,820
Thank you, Lawyer Cheng.

223
00:15:38,165 --> 00:15:39,605
Then, we'll see each other next time.

224
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:40,733
Goodbye.

225
00:15:43,362 --> 00:15:45,642
(Qian Heng)

226
00:15:45,765 --> 00:15:46,785
Boss.

227
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,015
Just now, Bai Xing Meng was so sad

228
00:15:49,111 --> 00:15:50,718
but we were still talking about your hourly fee.

229
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,760
Isn't that a bit insensitive?

230
00:15:52,874 --> 00:15:55,002
If being sensitive is useful, what do we need lawyers for?

231
00:15:57,574 --> 00:15:59,295
But, her personality is really good.

232
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,590
After what you've done, she didn't terminate your contract.

233
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:03,538
Instead, she wants to cooperate with you long-term.

234
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:07,283
Remember this. When you become irreplaceable in a certain field,

235
00:16:07,364 --> 00:16:08,975
and your professional skills are unparalleled,

236
00:16:09,092 --> 00:16:10,514
even if your attitude is bad,

237
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,082
others will have to adapt to you.

238
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,482
That makes sense.

239
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,470
But this time, it was just a lucky coincidence.

240
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:23,442
Your sharp tongue just saved her from self-destructing.

241
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:26,444
I saved her?

242
00:16:27,229 --> 00:16:30,362
You made her stop drowning in her feelings of failure and cheer up

243
00:16:30,464 --> 00:16:32,404
to give us more case information.

244
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,602
I collect a contingency fee from her.

245
00:16:35,821 --> 00:16:38,002
So the outcome of the case directly affects my income.

246
00:16:38,222 --> 00:16:39,581
I only care about my money

247
00:16:39,692 --> 00:16:41,962
not whether she cheers up or not.

248
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,101
Got it?

249
00:16:44,012 --> 00:16:47,482
May I know what the ratio is?

250
00:16:58,172 --> 00:16:59,922
Sorry, I asked too much.

251
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,882
(I haven't got a clue about Bai Xing Meng's case.)

252
00:18:27,426 --> 00:18:28,842
(What should I do?)

253
00:18:39,867 --> 00:18:41,428
My good boss.

254
00:18:41,552 --> 00:18:43,082
You've come home after work.

255
00:18:43,264 --> 00:18:45,162
Don't ask me those stupid questions.

256
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:46,989
How do you know?

257
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:48,602
I wish you could be more clear

258
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:50,642
that we are just co-renting.

259
00:18:50,849 --> 00:18:53,742
Outside working hours, don't bring up your work issues to me.

260
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:56,293
But I really don't know what to do with this case.

261
00:18:56,373 --> 00:18:58,277
Can you help me out and give me some guidance?

262
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,371
Who is the boss here?

263
00:18:59,452 --> 00:19:01,122
- You.   - Then, shut up.

264
00:19:04,684 --> 00:19:06,362
Take away all these annoying things.

265
00:19:06,842 --> 00:19:08,764
I bought these to decorate the house.

266
00:19:08,845 --> 00:19:12,042
Our rental house is too boring.

267
00:19:12,177 --> 00:19:14,772
In this unit, having one annoying thing, you, is enough.

268
00:20:19,942 --> 00:20:21,142
What song are you humming?

269
00:20:23,853 --> 00:20:26,202
You didn't say I can't hum when cooking.

270
00:20:26,571 --> 00:20:27,871
Hum it again.

271
00:20:28,463 --> 00:20:29,602
Come on. Hum it.

272
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,242
Hum while you're cooking.

273
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,179
You hum pretty well.

274
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,059
Okay, turn off the fire first.

275
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,482
Wait for half an hour. After I finish the material, you can hum again.

276
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,004
So, make sure the dish

277
00:21:01,085 --> 00:21:02,402
and the song are exactly the same.

278
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,199
But, I have to hurry and finish cooking

279
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,277
so I can review the Administration for Market Regulation's documents.

280
00:21:06,369 --> 00:21:08,489
After half an hour, you won't get anything important.

281
00:21:08,636 --> 00:21:10,322
Why do you always put me down?

282
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,682
For today's bill, you have paid double. That's it. No discussion.

283
00:21:21,078 --> 00:21:22,562
Who made you the boss?

284
00:21:50,483 --> 00:21:51,562
You may start now.

285
00:21:53,936 --> 00:21:56,442
(What? It's exploitation.)

286
00:23:23,643 --> 00:23:24,684
(Too bad.)

287
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,389
(I didn't manage to sleep until daybreak.)

288
00:23:49,578 --> 00:23:51,799
(Chef Cheng's Gold Preserved Egg and Lean Pork Congee)

289
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,139
(for 25 yuan, already deducted.)

290
00:23:54,527 --> 00:23:58,041
(Classic Cheng's Cuisine, Lotus Moonlit Night for 68 yuan,)

291
00:23:58,122 --> 00:23:59,593
(already deducted.)

292
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,042
(Specialty Dish, Chicken and Matsutake Mushroom Baked in a Clay Pot)

293
00:24:03,136 --> 00:24:05,738
(for 128 yuan, already deducted.)

294
00:24:54,692 --> 00:24:55,712
Cheng Yao.

295
00:24:57,013 --> 00:24:58,013
Cheng Yao.

296
00:24:59,637 --> 00:25:00,858
Come out.

297
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:16,480
Boss. Do you know

298
00:25:16,561 --> 00:25:20,196
waking up the employees at 3 am is against labor laws.

299
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:21,371
I know.

300
00:25:21,773 --> 00:25:22,773
You...

301
00:25:24,364 --> 00:25:26,122
Do you have a problem with me?

302
00:25:27,294 --> 00:25:29,042
You can ask those stupid questions now.

303
00:25:30,374 --> 00:25:31,474
Really?

304
00:25:33,246 --> 00:25:35,726
Boss, I know you are a kind boss who is willing to help others.

305
00:25:35,807 --> 00:25:37,282
You have already wasted 10 seconds.

306
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,017
I want ideas to trace Xu Jun's hidden assets.

307
00:25:39,606 --> 00:25:40,659
What I mean is

308
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,329
I don't know how to investigate Xu Jun's hidden assets.

309
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,200
What do you know about Xu Jun's planned listed company, Tuantuan Online?

310
00:25:48,281 --> 00:25:49,418
I took a look.

311
00:25:49,533 --> 00:25:52,722
Tuantuan Online hasn't had any unusual changes

312
00:25:52,838 --> 00:25:54,462
since Xu Jun got his marriage certificate in China.

313
00:25:54,573 --> 00:25:55,962
Did you even check properly?

314
00:25:56,086 --> 00:25:58,525
If Chinese Internet companies want to list overseas,

315
00:25:58,625 --> 00:26:00,532
they usually use the VIE model.

316
00:26:00,613 --> 00:26:02,363
What is VIE?

317
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:07,042
Variable Interest Entities, as translated directly from English.

318
00:26:07,212 --> 00:26:09,042
It is called agreement control in our country.

319
00:26:09,126 --> 00:26:11,282
It means that listed entities registered overseas

320
00:26:11,363 --> 00:26:13,322
are separated from domestic business operating entities.

321
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:14,482
Overseas listed entities

322
00:26:14,586 --> 00:26:16,890
control domestic business entities through agreements.

323
00:26:16,989 --> 00:26:19,202
The business entities are the VIEs of the listed entities.

324
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:23,042
Boss. Wait for me. I'm going to get my notepad.

325
00:26:31,086 --> 00:26:32,346
Let's get started, boss.

326
00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:34,762
But boss, isn't this VIE structure something

327
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,122
that lawyers involved in company listings and M&A need to learn?

328
00:26:37,203 --> 00:26:38,522
Do we need to learn it too?

329
00:26:39,093 --> 00:26:40,757
What do you think a family lawyer really does?

330
00:26:40,845 --> 00:26:43,306
Just mediating marital disputes and investigating infidelity?

331
00:26:44,579 --> 00:26:47,257
A top-notch family lawyer needs to be proficient in family law

332
00:26:47,338 --> 00:26:48,517
as well as securities law,

333
00:26:48,598 --> 00:26:50,479
corporate law, and laws related to taxation.

334
00:26:50,673 --> 00:26:52,595
Only in this way can you provide differentiated services

335
00:26:52,683 --> 00:26:54,682
that others can't replace for your clients

336
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,150
to expand your service market

337
00:26:56,253 --> 00:26:57,277
so that, like me,

338
00:26:57,358 --> 00:26:59,362
even if you have a bad temper, others have to pay the bill.

339
00:26:59,861 --> 00:27:02,603
(You are quite aware of yourself, huh?)

340
00:27:02,828 --> 00:27:04,013
So, do you know

341
00:27:04,172 --> 00:27:07,002
why Xu Jun chose to go public abroad instead of domestically?

342
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,659
I know this.

343
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:11,336
If Tuantuan Online wants to go public in China,

344
00:27:11,417 --> 00:27:13,839
they must meet the requirements in terms of revenue scale and profit.

345
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,200
However, Internet companies usually have losses in the early stages.

346
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,461
Moreover, the domestic listing review process is very long,

347
00:27:18,542 --> 00:27:20,882
so many companies will list overseas.

348
00:27:21,372 --> 00:27:22,762
Looks like you can still be saved.

349
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,873
But, boss, then what?

350
00:27:26,997 --> 00:27:30,516
Does the VIE structure have any effect on Xu Jun and Tuantuan Online?

351
00:27:30,629 --> 00:27:32,174
I have pointed out the direction to you.

352
00:27:32,286 --> 00:27:34,722
Can you look it up yourself? Stop thinking of being a freeloader.

353
00:27:39,446 --> 00:27:41,402
All right, I've said so much to you. I'm thirsty.

354
00:27:41,989 --> 00:27:43,108
I'm getting water for you, boss.

355
00:27:43,211 --> 00:27:44,331
Do you want to eat fruit?

356
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,242
Who eats fruit at three in the morning?

357
00:27:46,853 --> 00:27:49,002
Eating fruit can pay off the debt, right?

358
00:27:51,348 --> 00:27:52,520
I'm getting some water.

359
00:28:06,573 --> 00:28:07,722
Do you like it?

360
00:28:08,452 --> 00:28:10,362
Let me tell you. Don't underestimate it.

361
00:28:10,492 --> 00:28:12,882
This little thing has a pretty impressive name.

362
00:28:13,061 --> 00:28:14,650
It's called Wei Zhen Tian.

363
00:28:15,859 --> 00:28:18,576
It's so small, but the name is quite domineering.

364
00:28:18,657 --> 00:28:21,482
I know, right? At that time, I thought the name Wei Zhen Tian...

365
00:28:23,264 --> 00:28:25,322
I think it would be a good companion for you

366
00:28:25,813 --> 00:28:26,975
when you live alone,

367
00:28:27,056 --> 00:28:28,602
so you won't be lonely.

368
00:28:30,629 --> 00:28:32,522
I do like pets

369
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:36,122
but it looks quite expensive. I can't accept it.

370
00:28:36,223 --> 00:28:37,383
It's not an issue at all.

371
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:40,300
The owner went abroad, so he asked for adoption. It's free.

372
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,562
- Really?   - Really. I can give you his contact.

373
00:28:43,643 --> 00:28:44,743
You can ask him yourself.

374
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
It's okay.

375
00:28:47,554 --> 00:28:49,442
Thank you. I really like it.

376
00:28:50,077 --> 00:28:51,202
Wei Zhen Tian.

377
00:28:51,283 --> 00:28:52,994
From now on, I have you to accompany me.

378
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:54,299
You have me as well.

379
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:00,668
Cheng Xi, I have one more thing to do today.

380
00:29:00,765 --> 00:29:02,802
I just want to ask for some details.

381
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:05,922
Last time,

382
00:29:06,047 --> 00:29:07,722
we drank and had a meal together, right?

383
00:29:07,992 --> 00:29:10,143
And then...

384
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,748
What now?

385
00:29:17,984 --> 00:29:20,424
Wu, hurry! Come back to the office quickly.

386
00:29:20,668 --> 00:29:21,788
I'm busy.

387
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:23,282
I have something important to tell you.

388
00:29:23,377 --> 00:29:25,407
I also have something important.

389
00:29:26,228 --> 00:29:27,400
Okay, you don't want to come back, huh?

390
00:29:27,481 --> 00:29:29,563
Then, I'll ask Miss Wang to come to the firm for some tea.

391
00:29:29,698 --> 00:29:31,122
Okay, fine.

392
00:29:31,509 --> 00:29:33,295
I'll be back soon.

393
00:29:38,423 --> 00:29:40,013
Is there something urgent?

394
00:29:40,221 --> 00:29:41,399
Hurry back.

395
00:29:41,706 --> 00:29:43,202
Don't let people wait too long.

396
00:29:43,587 --> 00:29:44,722
It's Qian Heng.

397
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:46,922
I didn't say it wasn't Qian Heng.

398
00:29:47,878 --> 00:29:50,002
He said there was something urgent to settle at the firm. He...

399
00:29:50,349 --> 00:29:51,562
Lawyer Cheng.

400
00:29:52,204 --> 00:29:53,442
Hui?

401
00:29:53,627 --> 00:29:55,202
Last time, about my son...

402
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,682
Wait for me a bit, okay?

403
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,642
Sorry. That client of mine came to find me.

404
00:30:02,412 --> 00:30:03,883
Aren't you in a hurry?

405
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,322
Fine, then. You guys go ahead.

406
00:30:07,442 --> 00:30:08,681
I'll come back in two days.

407
00:30:08,838 --> 00:30:11,053
- Thank you for your dog.   - You're welcome.

408
00:30:11,972 --> 00:30:13,153
Goodbye.

409
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,202
- Bye.   - Okay.

410
00:30:18,645 --> 00:30:20,602
- Hui. Come in.   - Lawyer Cheng.

411
00:30:21,078 --> 00:30:22,640
I came early without saying hello.

412
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:23,762
It's fine. Sit down.

413
00:30:23,843 --> 00:30:25,426
About my son's case,

414
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,820
please help me take a look.

415
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,808
What happened? Why did you make me come back in such a hurry?

416
00:30:30,908 --> 00:30:34,162
Wu. I have a good news to tell you. I fell asleep yesterday.

417
00:30:36,652 --> 00:30:37,873
Congratulations.

418
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:48,077
Qian, I need to remind you.

419
00:30:48,212 --> 00:30:50,488
I'm just your business partner, not your pillow buddy.

420
00:30:50,569 --> 00:30:51,827
You don't have to be so excited

421
00:30:51,908 --> 00:30:53,884
and tell me about you sleeping in such a hurry.

422
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,522
Okay. You should go ahead.

423
00:30:57,863 --> 00:30:58,923
Boss.

424
00:30:59,798 --> 00:31:01,189
I found a breakthrough.

425
00:31:01,764 --> 00:31:02,903
You go first.

426
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,682
She just came in. Why are you making her leave?

427
00:31:05,761 --> 00:31:06,981
I'm talking about you.

428
00:31:12,212 --> 00:31:13,842
Is there something I shouldn't know?

429
00:31:16,869 --> 00:31:18,299
All right, you two talk first.

430
00:31:26,133 --> 00:31:27,133
Go ahead.

431
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,240
Since there are access restrictions in the Internet industry,

432
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:33,491
there must be a wholly domestic company wholly owned by Tuantuan Online

433
00:31:33,573 --> 00:31:35,493
that holds an Internet culture business license.

434
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,198
The licensed company has signed a comprehensive

435
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,400
technical support agreement to control with the foreign-funded company,

436
00:31:39,533 --> 00:31:42,253
thereby making it possible for the VIE to be listed overseas.

437
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:43,527
Novel business is one of the

438
00:31:43,608 --> 00:31:45,348
main businesses of Tuantuan Online at present.

439
00:31:45,429 --> 00:31:47,362
It is also a business favored by overseas investors.

440
00:31:47,527 --> 00:31:49,120
It can almost be determined this licensed company

441
00:31:49,201 --> 00:31:50,716
will greatly contribute to the overseas listing.

442
00:31:50,903 --> 00:31:51,972
Besides,

443
00:31:52,053 --> 00:31:54,922
the novel business was conducted during their marriage.

444
00:31:55,037 --> 00:31:56,558
This company that got the license

445
00:31:56,639 --> 00:31:58,479
was definitely established during their marriage.

446
00:31:58,652 --> 00:32:00,322
It was one of the 15 companies.

447
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:01,962
Wait.

448
00:32:02,781 --> 00:32:05,282
I'm not interested in your analysis process.

449
00:32:05,652 --> 00:32:07,275
I just want to get a result.

450
00:32:07,597 --> 00:32:09,562
Even if you researched for three days and three nights, it's no use.

451
00:32:09,642 --> 00:32:11,522
The process is meaningless to the client.

452
00:32:12,331 --> 00:32:14,425
I have already looked up the information and we can be sure that

453
00:32:14,513 --> 00:32:16,944
this company is Tuantuan Technology Network Co., Ltd.,

454
00:32:17,057 --> 00:32:19,017
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tuantuan Online.

455
00:32:19,214 --> 00:32:20,922
There must be something wrong with the company's losses.

456
00:32:21,077 --> 00:32:22,562
At least, during their divorce,

457
00:32:22,655 --> 00:32:24,475
their equity value was undervalued.

458
00:32:25,533 --> 00:32:27,002
Your performance is acceptable today.

459
00:32:27,332 --> 00:32:29,162
Thank you, boss. I will keep working hard.

460
00:32:44,783 --> 00:32:45,792
You can leave now.

461
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,349
How about it, Qian?

462
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:03,802
Have I found a capable assistant?

463
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:11,122
She's somewhat useful.

464
00:33:12,685 --> 00:33:14,605
Letting you, Lawyer Qian, feel that she's a bit useful

465
00:33:14,724 --> 00:33:16,555
is already quite an achievement, all right?

466
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:21,176
Is she a little bit like Cheng Xi in the past?

467
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,072
If you can hire Cheng Xi,

468
00:33:26,153 --> 00:33:27,802
we don't need to settle for this substitute.

469
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,242
You're a decent man, but what's wrong with your mouth?

470
00:33:43,123 --> 00:33:44,677
Don't gossip too much.

471
00:33:45,412 --> 00:33:46,593
Take care of yourself.

472
00:34:07,975 --> 00:34:10,211
(I don't think the boss is as bad as I imagined.)

473
00:34:10,292 --> 00:34:11,761
(He's actually quite nice.)

474
00:34:29,187 --> 00:34:30,817
(My pupils dilated!)

475
00:34:31,265 --> 00:34:32,975
(The boss transferred me to another case.)

476
00:34:33,128 --> 00:34:35,642
(Cheng Yao and him handle the Bai Xing Meng's case.)

477
00:34:36,973 --> 00:34:38,980
(The little girl is quite good.)

478
00:34:39,105 --> 00:34:40,872
(She just entered Lawyer Qian's office.)

479
00:34:40,992 --> 00:34:43,102
(Lawyer Qian kicked Lawyer Wu out right away.)

480
00:34:43,772 --> 00:34:46,082
(It looks like you're on to something.)

481
00:34:59,596 --> 00:35:01,986
We now have a direction for Xu Jun's hidden assets.

482
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:03,522
We can file the lawsuit anytime.

483
00:35:03,619 --> 00:35:04,842
It's up to you when to do it.

484
00:35:05,029 --> 00:35:06,842
Right now. Let's file the lawsuit immediately.

485
00:35:06,927 --> 00:35:08,856
We still have two months before the statute of limitations expires,

486
00:35:08,937 --> 00:35:11,997
but Xu Jun's company is now in the process of going public.

487
00:35:12,247 --> 00:35:13,888
It's very likely that they will successfully list on NASDAQ

488
00:35:13,969 --> 00:35:15,560
within the next month.

489
00:35:15,877 --> 00:35:17,023
If you file the lawsuit now,

490
00:35:17,152 --> 00:35:19,432
it will have a big negative impact on his business.

491
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,231
It could even affect the IPO.

492
00:35:21,395 --> 00:35:23,199
If you are willing to wait, then one month later,

493
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,442
once Tuantuan Online is listed on NASDAQ,

494
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:26,573
and you file the lawsuit then,

495
00:35:26,692 --> 00:35:29,082
you can multiply your gains.

496
00:35:29,414 --> 00:35:31,414
I hope you can make the best decision for yourself

497
00:35:31,536 --> 00:35:33,242
after fully understanding the situation.

498
00:35:37,172 --> 00:35:38,843
I want to file the lawsuit now.

499
00:35:39,736 --> 00:35:40,736
Okay.

500
00:35:40,941 --> 00:35:43,322
After that, I'll have a video conference. Cheng Yao.

501
00:35:43,732 --> 00:35:46,803
Next, you and Miss Bai can review the evidence list.

502
00:35:47,388 --> 00:35:49,202
Miss Bai. If you have any questions,

503
00:35:49,331 --> 00:35:51,042
you can communicate with Lawyer Cheng Yao.

504
00:35:51,172 --> 00:35:52,433
- Goodbye.   - No problem.

505
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,362
Miss Bai.

506
00:35:57,666 --> 00:35:59,362
So now, we can start with the review.

507
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,830
Let's chat for a while.

508
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,461
Lawyer Cheng.

509
00:36:07,973 --> 00:36:09,132
I don't have other intentions.

510
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,642
You're a girl, after all.

511
00:36:10,945 --> 00:36:14,135
I believe you can understand my feelings better.

512
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,202
I know you are lawyers, and time is precious for you.

513
00:36:17,283 --> 00:36:19,642
I'm willing to pay for the consultation fee.

514
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,524
But, right now,

515
00:36:24,043 --> 00:36:25,872
I don't want to talk about cold legal matters.

516
00:36:26,062 --> 00:36:27,531
I just want to chat a bit.

517
00:36:30,222 --> 00:36:32,102
Although I'm a celebrity,

518
00:36:32,404 --> 00:36:35,682
I can't talk to anyone about these private matters of mine,

519
00:36:35,807 --> 00:36:37,486
especially those in our industry.

520
00:36:37,714 --> 00:36:39,562
No one can make me open up.

521
00:36:40,374 --> 00:36:41,469
Tell me then.

522
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,021
I'll keep it a secret.

523
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:46,508
Of course, I believe you.

524
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,679
It was five years ago.

525
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,640
My costume drama was released.

526
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,980
It was very well received.

527
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,533
That's when I started to become famous

528
00:36:55,675 --> 00:36:57,042
and have fans.

529
00:36:58,221 --> 00:36:59,962
It was at the celebration party of that drama

530
00:37:00,043 --> 00:37:01,602
when I first met Xu Jun.

531
00:37:02,172 --> 00:37:04,602
At that time, he was still an unknown advertiser.

532
00:37:05,622 --> 00:37:08,280
I remember that drama was called "The Legend of the Golden House", right?

533
00:37:08,407 --> 00:37:10,266
- Yes.   - It was really hot at that time.

534
00:37:12,589 --> 00:37:14,299
He felt the same way.

535
00:37:14,619 --> 00:37:16,242
He said he was my fan.

536
00:37:18,838 --> 00:37:20,148
Excuse me for a moment.

537
00:37:25,812 --> 00:37:26,812
Hello.

538
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:29,130
You acted really well.

539
00:37:29,518 --> 00:37:31,977
- Thank you.   - My name is Xu Jun.

540
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:33,882
I'm your fan.

541
00:37:35,032 --> 00:37:36,072
Hello.

542
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:38,442
At that time, his career had just started,

543
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:40,042
and he didn't have much money.

544
00:37:40,407 --> 00:37:42,002
But, I still fell in love with him.

545
00:37:43,332 --> 00:37:44,592
Happy birthday.

546
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,303
How is it?

547
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,362
For his sake, I violated the contract.

548
00:38:13,383 --> 00:38:14,882
Within the contract period,

549
00:38:15,652 --> 00:38:17,323
I secretly got married.

550
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:44,442
What followed was the company's revenge.

551
00:38:45,511 --> 00:38:47,341
They even planned to stop engaging me in projects.

552
00:38:47,755 --> 00:38:50,602
Right after that, I paid a huge breach of contract fee.

553
00:38:50,721 --> 00:38:53,322
From then onward, my career plummeted.

554
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,870
I suffered a devastating blow to my career.

555
00:38:58,943 --> 00:39:01,035
(Xing Meng, what's wrong with you?)

556
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,360
(Yesterday, you just finished the new drama's press conference.)

557
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:05,362
(Your pairing with the male lead hasn't been heated up yet.)

558
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:07,518
(And, your date with Xu Jun was photographed again.)

559
00:39:07,692 --> 00:39:09,522
(Didn't I tell you to be careful?)

560
00:39:09,732 --> 00:39:11,373
(If you keep doing this, we can't help you.)

561
00:39:11,453 --> 00:39:12,453
I...

562
00:39:17,037 --> 00:39:21,162
The photos of me and Xing Meng watching a movie, were they all posted?

563
00:39:24,558 --> 00:39:26,308
I'm just asking if they were posted or not.

564
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,350
Can you make sure it will be on the top headline?

565
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:33,720
Okay, I got it.

566
00:39:35,904 --> 00:39:38,254
How can he do this? He's crossed the line.

567
00:39:39,375 --> 00:39:40,740
It's understandable.

568
00:39:40,941 --> 00:39:44,762
At that time, Tuantuan Online was just starting out. They needed traffic.

569
00:39:45,013 --> 00:39:46,602
Dating a female celebrity

570
00:39:46,768 --> 00:39:48,957
was more effective than any advertisement.

571
00:39:49,694 --> 00:39:51,494
Unfortunately, I understood it too late

572
00:39:51,678 --> 00:39:54,962
that this was the real purpose of him dating and marrying me.

573
00:39:55,252 --> 00:39:57,409
Miss Bai, please rest assured.

574
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:59,522
I will definitely help you fight for your rights.

575
00:40:02,524 --> 00:40:04,522
Thank you, Lawyer Cheng.

576
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,992
Thank you for being patient and listening to me.

577
00:40:17,872 --> 00:40:20,802
Cheng Xi. Why did you divorce your husband?

578
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,470
Weren't you two getting along well?

579
00:40:24,458 --> 00:40:25,652
He cheated.

580
00:40:25,817 --> 00:40:27,847
Wait. How could he do that?

581
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:29,322
It's just bad luck for me.

582
00:40:29,403 --> 00:40:30,953
Let's not mention him anymore.

583
00:41:06,592 --> 00:41:08,182
Yao Yao, what's up?

584
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:11,962
Nothing. I just miss you.

585
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,041
This weekend, shall we go to the amusement park?

586
00:41:15,131 --> 00:41:17,672
No problem. You buy the tickets and I'll go.

587
00:41:19,222 --> 00:41:20,442
I'll buy the tickets.

588
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,590
Why aren't you off work yet?

589
00:41:40,732 --> 00:41:42,562
I'm still looking up information.

590
00:41:43,252 --> 00:41:44,642
Oh, right, boss.

591
00:41:44,772 --> 00:41:46,412
I've already talked to Bai Xing Meng.

592
00:41:46,493 --> 00:41:48,522
Her decision is to file the lawsuit right away.

593
00:41:48,764 --> 00:41:51,922
Tomorrow, I can send you the first draft for you to review.

594
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:54,310
Then, I'm hoping to submit the case filing materials to the court

595
00:41:54,391 --> 00:41:55,571
by next Tuesday.

596
00:41:57,869 --> 00:41:59,411
Work needs to be balanced with rest.

597
00:41:59,492 --> 00:42:00,492
Let's get off work.

598
00:42:02,533 --> 00:42:03,552
Let's go.

599
00:42:24,613 --> 00:42:27,692
Boss. I didn't expect you to care about people.

600
00:42:27,872 --> 00:42:29,652
I mean I need to balance work and rest.

601
00:42:29,794 --> 00:42:31,161
Don't work too hard in the wrong direction.

602
00:42:31,242 --> 00:42:32,343
Go home and cook.

603
00:42:32,676 --> 00:42:35,362
Didn't you say that I can only prepare supper after 11 o'clock?

604
00:42:35,812 --> 00:42:37,895
Eating out affects my work efficiency.

605
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:39,882
Your cooking skills are acceptable.

606
00:42:39,966 --> 00:42:41,402
From now on, you'll be in charge of dinner.

607
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:45,642
But, does your work efficiency have anything to do with me?

608
00:42:45,776 --> 00:42:46,852
Not really.

609
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,949
But, one meal can be exchanged for two chances to ask silly questions.

610
00:42:51,451 --> 00:42:52,710
Really?

611
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:54,362
What do you want to eat then?

612
00:42:54,443 --> 00:42:55,762
Do you want me to sing while cooking?

613
00:42:55,964 --> 00:42:57,834
Or maybe have some music to accompany the meal?

614
00:42:58,292 --> 00:43:01,202
After all, you're the first one to praise my singing.

615
00:43:01,301 --> 00:43:02,891
You gave me a lot of confidence.

616
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,941
The 250th rule of the co-living agreement:

617
00:43:05,053 --> 00:43:06,772
no singing while cooking dinner.

618
00:43:06,852 --> 00:43:08,652
When making supper, you must sing.

619
00:43:10,698 --> 00:43:14,314
Boss, I've always been curious why you let me make supper,

620
00:43:14,395 --> 00:43:15,578
then I'm prohibited from doing that,

621
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:17,642
- and now, you're asking me to do that again.   - Shut up.
