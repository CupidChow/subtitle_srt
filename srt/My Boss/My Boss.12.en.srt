1
00:01:35,627 --> 00:01:38,762
(My Boss)

2
00:01:40,037 --> 00:01:43,098
(Episode 12)

3
00:01:43,179 --> 00:01:45,842
(Was I praising her just now?)

4
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,258
A kinship test is useless when it's done

5
00:01:51,282 --> 00:01:53,722
on children of different genders who share the same father.

6
00:01:54,174 --> 00:01:56,522
Didn't Chen Qing Mei say she was pregnant with a son?

7
00:01:56,796 --> 00:01:58,682
So, the kinship test can actually be done.

8
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,370
Dong Shan's father is still alive.

9
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,981
Although his health is not great,

10
00:02:02,062 --> 00:02:03,922
as long as he's alive, we can do it.

11
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,459
We can have Dong Shan's father

12
00:02:05,552 --> 00:02:08,009
take part in a kinship test with the child in Chen Qing Mei's belly.

13
00:02:08,033 --> 00:02:09,502
By comparing the Y chromosomes,

14
00:02:09,585 --> 00:02:12,545
we can determine if the child has come from the same paternal line as him.

15
00:02:12,726 --> 00:02:15,202
But, I remember that the effectiveness of kinship testing

16
00:02:15,288 --> 00:02:17,682
is weaker than paternity testing, right?

17
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,296
Yes. The effectiveness of kinship testing is indeed

18
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,280
weaker than paternity testing and it is also considered indirect evidence.

19
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,932
If we only have this single piece of evidence,

20
00:02:24,956 --> 00:02:26,436
we may not necessarily win this case.

21
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,670
But, if we combine it with other evidence

22
00:02:28,789 --> 00:02:31,126
to form a complete chain of evidence with no logical loopholes,

23
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,830
then the court will presume that the child in Chen Qing Mei's belly

24
00:02:33,909 --> 00:02:35,298
is of Dong Shan's bloodline.

25
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,318
So now, all we need to do is proving

26
00:02:40,399 --> 00:02:42,404
that the child in Chen Qing Mei's belly is not related by blood

27
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:45,242
to anyone in Dong Shan's paternal line, except for Dong Shan.

28
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:46,883
Dong Shan has no brothers.

29
00:02:46,988 --> 00:02:49,597
We just need to prove the child is not Dong Shan's father's. That's all.

30
00:02:49,621 --> 00:02:51,402
As for other chains of evidence,

31
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,920
we can go to Chen Qing Mei's prenatal hospital.

32
00:02:54,021 --> 00:02:55,370
There will be information input

33
00:02:55,771 --> 00:02:57,393
recording the situation of the child's parents.

34
00:02:57,417 --> 00:03:00,576
Dong Shan most likely will have some records there which are also signed.

35
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,709
Also, if the hospital can provide surveillance

36
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:04,597
to prove that Dong Shan accompanied Chen Qing Mei multiple times

37
00:03:04,621 --> 00:03:06,861
for prenatal check-ups, that would be even more perfect.

38
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,600
And, if Chen Qing Mei's apartment can also provide surveillance,

39
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,328
maybe we can extract the evidence to prove

40
00:03:14,352 --> 00:03:15,832
Dong Shan has visited multiple times.

41
00:03:23,197 --> 00:03:24,397
These are some of my thoughts.

42
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,960
If you feel there are any issues, please kindly point them out.

43
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,083
You have considered it very thoroughly.

44
00:03:29,107 --> 00:03:30,867
This suggestion is good. Let's go with this.

45
00:03:36,545 --> 00:03:37,642
Boss.

46
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,482
Were you just praising Cheng Yao?

47
00:03:44,288 --> 00:03:45,368
Was I praising her?

48
00:03:45,485 --> 00:03:46,785
Yes, you were.

49
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:51,788
What I meant was, Cheng Yao's suggestion requires a heavy workload.

50
00:03:51,812 --> 00:03:54,332
If you don't want to work overtime, make good use of your time.

51
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,180
Is this not called praise?

52
00:04:02,455 --> 00:04:04,204
It's so obvious that he's praising.

53
00:04:04,846 --> 00:04:08,436
I know if he's praising someone because he used to praise me a lot.

54
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,740
I'll go to the restroom first.

55
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:31,602
- I'll leave now. - See you tomorrow.

56
00:04:31,693 --> 00:04:32,762
Bye.

57
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,821
Cheng Yao, I'm not exaggerating when I say this.

58
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,339
It's the first time he praises someone like that.

59
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:41,843
If I were you, I would be so happy I'd scream when I get home.

60
00:04:42,068 --> 00:04:43,668
Maybe the boss praised me in hopes that

61
00:04:43,748 --> 00:04:45,268
I would work harder and stay overtime.

62
00:04:45,859 --> 00:04:47,159
That

63
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,620
makes sense.

64
00:04:50,065 --> 00:04:51,365
No wonder he didn't praise me.

65
00:04:52,055 --> 00:04:53,495
He doesn't want me to work overtime.

66
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,642
After all, I am Junheng's heir apparent.

67
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,480
I need to take care of my health.

68
00:04:58,142 --> 00:04:59,442
So, I'm going home to rest now.

69
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,166
No wonder he didn't praise me. So, he didn't want me to work overtime.

70
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,349
Goodbye, Bao.

71
00:05:05,448 --> 00:05:06,748
Bye.

72
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,006
Cheng Yao.

73
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,802
Are you going back today?

74
00:05:45,453 --> 00:05:46,482
I'm sorry, boss.

75
00:05:46,563 --> 00:05:48,402
I might not be going back for a while.

76
00:05:48,697 --> 00:05:50,459
I want to focus on this case.

77
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,642
I won't be able to cook for you either. I'm sorry.

78
00:05:54,223 --> 00:05:56,343
It's okay. It's not like I can't survive without you.

79
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,718
That's good. By the way, I've sent the case materials to your email.

80
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:03,599
If there's anything wrong, please let me know anytime. I'll leave now.

81
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,420
Poor her.

82
00:07:37,576 --> 00:07:39,510
(There's a paper copy of the case materials at home.)

83
00:07:39,534 --> 00:07:41,364
(Go back and get them. You'll need them.)

84
00:08:01,388 --> 00:08:04,122
(Hurry up. Otherwise, I won't catch the last bus.)

85
00:08:16,576 --> 00:08:18,402
(He didn't move out, right?)

86
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,598
(If you don't have money, don't pretend to be rich and stay in a hotel.)

87
00:08:31,622 --> 00:08:33,961
(It's better to think about how to improve work efficiency)

88
00:08:33,985 --> 00:08:35,442
(and keep your year-end bonus.)

89
00:08:36,748 --> 00:08:39,042
(I'll go back and stay at the villa. You stay here.)

90
00:08:39,748 --> 00:08:41,339
(I don't recommend silent dedication.)

91
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:42,682
(It's not efficient.)

92
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:45,962
(Did he leave because he wanted me to move back?)

93
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,871
No wonder he's the boss.

94
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,391
(He even helped me write such detailed footnotes.)

95
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:13,762
Cheng Xi.

96
00:10:14,176 --> 00:10:15,282
Cheng Xi.

97
00:10:15,736 --> 00:10:16,896
What are you doing?

98
00:10:17,001 --> 00:10:19,831
Didn't I tell you before? If you come here again, I'll call the police.

99
00:10:19,855 --> 00:10:21,365
Let me say a few words to you.

100
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,603
I'll leave after I say a few words.

101
00:10:23,627 --> 00:10:24,842
You...

102
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,591
You have no idea

103
00:10:47,941 --> 00:10:49,412
how I spent this year.

104
00:10:49,965 --> 00:10:51,082
She,

105
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,531
relying on her family's wealth,

106
00:10:53,988 --> 00:10:56,279
bullied me at home.

107
00:10:56,469 --> 00:10:59,579
You have no idea how much I have suffered this year.

108
00:11:00,372 --> 00:11:01,723
Can you please stop?

109
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,402
You are speaking ill of your current wife in front of your ex-wife.

110
00:11:05,549 --> 00:11:07,538
Don't you think you are despicable?

111
00:11:09,748 --> 00:11:11,562
Cheng Xi, let me tell you.

112
00:11:11,658 --> 00:11:12,969
I am doing well now.

113
00:11:14,116 --> 00:11:15,506
I have money.

114
00:11:17,412 --> 00:11:18,695
I have fame.

115
00:11:19,405 --> 00:11:20,705
I have wealth.

116
00:11:20,963 --> 00:11:23,922
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you.

117
00:11:24,285 --> 00:11:25,602
Cheng Xi, I love you.

118
00:11:26,302 --> 00:11:29,402
I don't believe you don't care at all about our past relationship.

119
00:11:33,238 --> 00:11:34,402
Yes.

120
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,242
I do care.

121
00:11:39,109 --> 00:11:40,482
Come on. Come here.

122
00:11:40,941 --> 00:11:43,197
- What for? - I've recorded your despicable behavior,

123
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:44,758
and I'll send it to your wife to see.

124
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,722
Do you think you are really amazing because someone is pursuing you?

125
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,566
Wu Jun is just pretending to like you.

126
00:11:54,358 --> 00:11:55,602
Only I...

127
00:11:56,652 --> 00:11:58,442
Only I am truly in love with you.

128
00:11:58,523 --> 00:11:59,992
Come on. Take a look.

129
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,520
You were secretly filming me?

130
00:12:05,601 --> 00:12:07,922
Wait. Cheng Xi. Do you know

131
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:11,545
Wu Jun's ex-girlfriends are all top-notch?

132
00:12:11,626 --> 00:12:15,802
Why would he want someone like you, a divorced woman?

133
00:12:16,685 --> 00:12:18,235
He's just playing around.

134
00:12:18,533 --> 00:12:19,642
Cheng Xi,

135
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:21,838
I'm afraid you'll get hurt.

136
00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:24,219
I'm afraid you'll get hurt.

137
00:12:24,822 --> 00:12:26,533
I'm afraid you'll get hurt.

138
00:12:26,934 --> 00:12:28,202
Cheng Xi.

139
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,030
Cheng Xi, I love you.

140
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,450
Are you sober now?

141
00:12:34,531 --> 00:12:35,961
If you're sober, leave now.

142
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:39,977
Okay. I'm leaving.

143
00:12:40,574 --> 00:12:41,802
I'm leaving.

144
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,522
Cheng Xi.

145
00:12:53,246 --> 00:12:55,922
Even if you treat me like this, I still love you.

146
00:13:27,871 --> 00:13:30,482
Your girlfriend said she put a chocolate bar in your pocket.

147
00:13:30,563 --> 00:13:32,723
So that you can have a few bites after getting up

148
00:13:32,804 --> 00:13:34,525
to replenish your sugar intake.

149
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,962
(Are you busy today? Why haven't you replied to my messages?)

150
00:14:33,596 --> 00:14:35,836
(Do you want to go rock climbing together this weekend?)

151
00:14:59,682 --> 00:15:01,179
The environment at this nursing home is really nice.

152
00:15:01,203 --> 00:15:02,443
It must be expensive for a day.

153
00:15:02,496 --> 00:15:03,926
Grandpa, I'll leave first.

154
00:15:04,388 --> 00:15:06,122
If you miss me, just give me a call.

155
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,694
- What are you doing? - I don't know.

156
00:15:11,718 --> 00:15:13,522
- Come here. - Okay.

157
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,760
What is it?

158
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:17,002
Dong Min.

159
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,680
You are indeed thoughtful. After all,

160
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,802
we're trying to convince the grandpa to betray his granddaughter.

161
00:15:24,926 --> 00:15:26,882
If this gets out, it will be hard to handle.

162
00:15:31,072 --> 00:15:32,456
(Grandpa Dong is very stubborn.)

163
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,849
(If you can't handle it, let me know immediately.)

164
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,184
- What's wrong? - Nothing.

165
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:40,002
The boss said to leave it to us. He trusts us.

166
00:15:41,103 --> 00:15:42,454
Hurry, Dong Min is leaving.

167
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,867
I heard that Dong Shan had been doing business outside and

168
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,707
Grandpa Dong has always been taken care of by Jiang Wen Xiu and Dong Min.

169
00:15:53,731 --> 00:15:55,482
The relationship between them is very good.

170
00:15:55,817 --> 00:15:57,997
It might be a bit difficult to convince him today.

171
00:15:58,456 --> 00:15:59,496
But, don't worry.

172
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,839
With me, Bao,

173
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,255
as long as it's for Junheng's good,

174
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,239
Grandpa Dong won't be able to run away from this.

175
00:16:11,174 --> 00:16:12,282
Mr. Dong.

176
00:16:12,465 --> 00:16:14,665
I know that you have a good relationship with Dong Min.

177
00:16:14,757 --> 00:16:16,762
Making this decision might be very difficult.

178
00:16:16,925 --> 00:16:18,225
But...

179
00:16:18,614 --> 00:16:19,722
But...

180
00:16:20,742 --> 00:16:22,733
Is it a boy or a girl?

181
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,722
A boy.

182
00:16:25,224 --> 00:16:26,402
Are you sure?

183
00:16:26,933 --> 00:16:28,562
If it's a girl,

184
00:16:28,767 --> 00:16:30,067
I won't do it.

185
00:16:30,688 --> 00:16:32,848
Having Min is enough for me.

186
00:16:32,988 --> 00:16:34,562
I don't want a stranger

187
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,530
to divide her inheritance.

188
00:16:39,597 --> 00:16:41,548
We're sure it's a boy.

189
00:16:41,812 --> 00:16:44,671
They went to Hong Kong to do a gender test.

190
00:16:49,584 --> 00:16:51,522
The B-ultrasound they did

191
00:16:51,727 --> 00:16:52,802
is not accurate.

192
00:16:52,988 --> 00:16:56,519
Sometimes, a boy is mistakenly identified as a girl.

193
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,121
They did a chromosomal test

194
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:02,970
and clearly saw the Y chromosome,

195
00:17:03,077 --> 00:17:04,610
confirming it's a boy.

196
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,202
And, we're going to do a kinship test.

197
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:10,002
If it was a girl, we couldn't do it.

198
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,081
If it's confirmed to be a boy,

199
00:17:13,162 --> 00:17:14,462
then I'll do it.

200
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,791
After all, it's about the Dong family's bloodline.

201
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,359
Mr. Dong, you can also...

202
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:25,041
You can take a look at this agreement.

203
00:17:25,193 --> 00:17:26,493
You can take a glance.

204
00:17:29,311 --> 00:17:32,201
Mr. Dong. If you are worried about the Dong family's assets,

205
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:34,659
there are professional managers who can act as your agents.

206
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,795
Or, you can set up a family trust.

207
00:17:36,876 --> 00:17:39,106
Regardless of gender, it will not affect your assets.

208
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,419
After all,

209
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:44,242
girls will eventually get married and have children.

210
00:17:44,323 --> 00:17:45,443
Yes.

211
00:17:45,628 --> 00:17:47,482
If we let her take care of the children

212
00:17:47,563 --> 00:17:48,993
while managing a company,

213
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,500
it'd be too tiring for her.

214
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,242
Your handwriting is really good.

215
00:18:04,724 --> 00:18:07,042
(Grandpa, get well soon! Your granddaughter, Dong Min)

216
00:18:16,357 --> 00:18:17,517
It's very smooth.

217
00:18:17,605 --> 00:18:19,005
I didn't expect it to be so smooth.

218
00:18:20,201 --> 00:18:22,601
Do you want to eat an orange? I just stole it from the room.

219
00:18:25,277 --> 00:18:26,988
I'm answering a call from a client.

220
00:18:32,456 --> 00:18:35,378
At such a young age, you don't understand the wife's situation.

221
00:18:35,506 --> 00:18:36,806
I can understand that.

222
00:18:36,981 --> 00:18:39,562
But, how can you help the mistress fight for the assets?

223
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,482
You're deceiving an old man with a confused mind to sign the papers.

224
00:18:42,662 --> 00:18:44,267
How can you lawyers do this?

225
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,630
To earn money, you're not even keeping your conscience?

226
00:18:47,232 --> 00:18:49,056
It's just pitiful for his daughter-in-law and granddaughter.

227
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,910
They took care of him for so long,

228
00:18:50,991 --> 00:18:53,071
but in the end, they're still being schemed against.

229
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,031
What kind of world is this?

230
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,820
And now, another big case.

231
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,482
What a day.

232
00:19:06,642 --> 00:19:07,922
Everything is going so smoothly.

233
00:19:08,334 --> 00:19:09,443
Let me treat you to some milk tea.

234
00:19:09,467 --> 00:19:11,351
No need. I want to go back to the firm first.

235
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,579
What's the rush? It's still early, isn't it?

236
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,512
I want to donate the lawyer fees to a charity organization.

237
00:19:19,977 --> 00:19:21,277
Donate?

238
00:19:21,717 --> 00:19:23,197
Then, aren't you working for nothing?

239
00:19:23,766 --> 00:19:25,066
Lawyer Cheng.

240
00:19:26,022 --> 00:19:28,091
Miss Chen, why are you here?

241
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,751
I'm worried sick.

242
00:19:30,957 --> 00:19:32,157
How did your discussion go?

243
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:33,538
Was it successful?

244
00:19:33,822 --> 00:19:35,372
He has agreed to do the test.

245
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,741
But, aren't you close to your due date?

246
00:19:37,841 --> 00:19:39,041
You only have two months left.

247
00:19:39,069 --> 00:19:41,508
You should rest well. About the evidence chain, we will prepare it.

248
00:19:41,532 --> 00:19:42,832
You can rest assured.

249
00:19:43,414 --> 00:19:45,614
No. I want to do it now,

250
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,020
immediately.

251
00:19:47,315 --> 00:19:48,842
I have consulted with the doctor.

252
00:19:48,953 --> 00:19:51,512
We can use cord blood for DNA testing.

253
00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:53,060
How can that be?

254
00:19:53,188 --> 00:19:54,762
There will be a risk of miscarriage.

255
00:19:54,935 --> 00:19:57,525
- Okay, how about you wait for us to... - I can't wait that long.

256
00:19:57,549 --> 00:20:01,181
Two months is enough time for Jiang Wen Xiu to transfer her assets.

257
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:03,002
When I give birth to this child,

258
00:20:03,156 --> 00:20:07,507
the money left for him will probably not be much.

259
00:20:09,903 --> 00:20:10,942
In that case,

260
00:20:11,093 --> 00:20:12,854
if they intentionally transfer assets,

261
00:20:12,949 --> 00:20:14,028
we can sue them.

262
00:20:14,109 --> 00:20:16,042
- So, you don't have to worry. - Exactly.

263
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,940
Sue them?

264
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,100
Is suing effective?

265
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,800
Lawyer Cheng. I believe you should know

266
00:20:22,881 --> 00:20:24,722
that even if we win some cases,

267
00:20:24,812 --> 00:20:26,372
it's difficult to enforce the judgment.

268
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,510
So, as a single woman, if I can't get the money,

269
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,000
how will I survive in the future?

270
00:20:32,081 --> 00:20:33,601
How will I be able to raise the child?

271
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,720
Lawyer Cheng. As a woman, I believe you will understand.

272
00:20:37,801 --> 00:20:38,962
Right?

273
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,470
I thought Chen Qing Mei, as a mother, would at least love her own child.

274
00:20:52,148 --> 00:20:53,613
When she was pregnant,

275
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,099
she probably had the idea of using the child

276
00:20:56,533 --> 00:20:58,335
to become rich

277
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,640
by turning herself from a mistress to the main wife.

278
00:21:02,093 --> 00:21:04,417
Unfortunately, Dong Shan has passed away.

279
00:21:04,498 --> 00:21:08,327
If he knew of Chen Qing Mei's true face, I wonder if he would regret it.

280
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:13,115
Cheng Yao, don't get too caught up in cases.

281
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,120
Think about it from a different perspective.

282
00:21:15,228 --> 00:21:18,379
For the law firm, this is a two billion yuan case.

283
00:21:18,494 --> 00:21:20,669
As long as Chen Qing Mei doesn't owe any legal fees,

284
00:21:20,749 --> 00:21:22,722
she is a high-quality client.

285
00:21:26,296 --> 00:21:29,097
Cheng Yao, you have only been a lawyer for less than two years.

286
00:21:29,269 --> 00:21:32,038
There are many things you don't understand. I understand that.

287
00:21:32,396 --> 00:21:33,637
Learn more from me.

288
00:21:33,718 --> 00:21:34,958
A case is a case.

289
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:36,562
You are yourself.

290
00:21:36,685 --> 00:21:38,114
Don't let yourself...

291
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,581
It's no big deal, all right? Even if you are upset,

292
00:21:41,129 --> 00:21:42,849
then let me treat you to a cup of milk tea.

293
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,749
The car is here. Maybe next time.

294
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,802
Today, you met with Grandpa Dong. How did it go?

295
00:22:20,431 --> 00:22:22,151
Very smoothly. When Grandpa Dong heard that

296
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:23,644
Chen Qing Mei is pregnant with a boy,

297
00:22:23,668 --> 00:22:25,669
he readily agreed to do a kinship test.

298
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,350
The results will be out in three days.

299
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,296
When you were in the nursing home, were you always with Cheng Yao?

300
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,361
Yes.

301
00:22:32,473 --> 00:22:34,633
- Are you sure? You've never been apart? - I'm sure.

302
00:22:37,072 --> 00:22:38,372
Well, I'm not really sure.

303
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:43,329
I received a call

304
00:22:43,991 --> 00:22:45,291
from a client.

305
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,740
It took less than a minute.

306
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,931
Maybe two minutes. Then, I went back to meet her again.

307
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,860
Is there a problem?

308
00:22:54,143 --> 00:22:55,355
Bao Rui, let me remind you.

309
00:22:55,505 --> 00:22:58,316
When you go out on a mission with your colleagues, don't separate easily.

310
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,562
If something happens, you can take care of each other.

311
00:23:03,223 --> 00:23:05,372
Boss, actually, I know

312
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,920
that every time I go on a mission,

313
00:23:06,966 --> 00:23:08,276
you are very worried about me.

314
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,270
Don't worry. I won't have any problems.

315
00:23:12,314 --> 00:23:13,722
Is there anything else?

316
00:23:13,813 --> 00:23:14,928
Just leave.

317
00:23:15,033 --> 00:23:16,162
Okay.

318
00:23:29,784 --> 00:23:31,095
Wait a moment.

319
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,590
(I had someone send a bouquet of peonies to you.)

320
00:23:44,821 --> 00:23:46,252
(I hope you like it.)

321
00:24:01,084 --> 00:24:02,242
Cheng Xi.

322
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,427
What's wrong?

323
00:24:06,508 --> 00:24:07,938
Why are you so angry?

324
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,780
Nothing.

325
00:24:10,758 --> 00:24:13,398
- Why did you come? - So, you didn't reply to my WeChat messages

326
00:24:13,464 --> 00:24:15,682
nor did you answer my calls.

327
00:24:15,878 --> 00:24:18,322
So, I came in person to apologize to you.

328
00:24:20,655 --> 00:24:21,955
Wu Jun.

329
00:24:22,255 --> 00:24:23,555
Let's not contact

330
00:24:24,493 --> 00:24:25,793
each other anymore.

331
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:29,569
Why? What did I do wrong?

332
00:24:32,183 --> 00:24:34,623
You didn't do anything wrong. The one with the problem is me.

333
00:24:34,776 --> 00:24:37,767
What problem do you have?

334
00:24:37,948 --> 00:24:40,468
Just tell me if you have any problems. Let's solve it together.

335
00:24:43,945 --> 00:24:46,602
It's Deng Ming. He came to see me a couple of days ago.

336
00:24:46,754 --> 00:24:48,585
Aren't you two divorced?

337
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:51,082
Is he here to cause trouble? Tell me.

338
00:24:51,226 --> 00:24:52,546
I'll warn him to leave you alone.

339
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,220
Wu Jun, don't interfere.

340
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,910
This is my business. I don't want you to get involved.

341
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,601
Cheng Xi. Did he threaten you again?

342
00:24:58,725 --> 00:25:00,764
Cheng Xi, don't worry about this at all.

343
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,358
Don't be afraid. I'm not afraid either.

344
00:25:02,382 --> 00:25:05,612
If he dares to come over and go against me, he will definitely suffer.

345
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:08,132
This is not

346
00:25:08,228 --> 00:25:10,239
a question of whether we are afraid or not.

347
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,880
If you get close to me,

348
00:25:11,948 --> 00:25:13,082
it won't do you any good.

349
00:25:13,163 --> 00:25:14,362
He will threaten you.

350
00:25:14,443 --> 00:25:17,362
If I back down because of this, am I still a man?

351
00:25:18,468 --> 00:25:20,788
Cheng Xi, don't worry. I will take responsibility for you.

352
00:25:21,247 --> 00:25:22,547
What kind of responsibility?

353
00:25:23,341 --> 00:25:24,821
So, back when we were at the hotel...

354
00:25:27,061 --> 00:25:28,690
Speak clearer!

355
00:25:31,262 --> 00:25:32,532
Back when we were at the hotel...

356
00:25:32,556 --> 00:25:33,762
What happened at the hotel?

357
00:25:34,121 --> 00:25:36,880
I drank too much, right? We did do something, right? And then, I...

358
00:25:36,982 --> 00:25:38,930
Although I don't remember clearly...

359
00:25:40,233 --> 00:25:43,162
- That... - Nothing happened between us that day.

360
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:46,962
Your phone ran out of battery. So, I left you some money to order a ride.

361
00:25:47,856 --> 00:25:48,976
So, what about my clothes...

362
00:25:49,046 --> 00:25:52,522
You threw up. Your clothes were all stained. I helped you take them off.

363
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,762
That's all.

364
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,050
We didn't do anything?

365
00:25:59,845 --> 00:26:02,062
It's okay. It's okay even if we didn't do anything.

366
00:26:02,214 --> 00:26:03,894
It doesn't matter to my affection for you.

367
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:07,253
How can you be so stubborn?

368
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:11,619
Are you made of toffee?

369
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:14,718
How do you know I'm made of toffee?

370
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,221
Yes. I just want to stick to you. I've always wanted to

371
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,940
stay by your side.

372
00:26:19,422 --> 00:26:20,652
Phone call.

373
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:23,482
- Not answering. - Miss Wang is looking for you.

374
00:26:28,228 --> 00:26:29,779
It's Qian Heng.

375
00:26:30,348 --> 00:26:33,096
- Speak. - (Come to the address I sent you. I need to ask you something.)

376
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,322
I'm busy.

377
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:38,750
- It's not Miss Wang. - Go. He needs to ask you something.

378
00:26:39,904 --> 00:26:41,263
Okay, I'll go handle it first.

379
00:26:41,344 --> 00:26:42,842
I'll see what's going on with him.

380
00:26:43,377 --> 00:26:44,565
I'll come find you in a few days.

381
00:26:44,589 --> 00:26:47,528
- Don't come find me anymore. - No. I'll put this here.

382
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:04,322
Come in.

383
00:27:08,351 --> 00:27:09,651
What are you doing?

384
00:27:09,901 --> 00:27:11,642
Isn't it obvious? Soaking my feet.

385
00:27:12,425 --> 00:27:15,353
Can you please get me a bucket of hot water? I also want to warm myself up.

386
00:27:15,377 --> 00:27:16,442
Okay.

387
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:19,139
Rejected again?

388
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,220
Is it that obvious?

389
00:27:24,967 --> 00:27:27,434
Hearing your voice, it's hard not to think about it.

390
00:27:30,031 --> 00:27:32,423
It's gone. Everything is gone, Qian.

391
00:27:33,076 --> 00:27:34,509
So, it was all just a misunderstanding.

392
00:27:34,533 --> 00:27:35,719
She has never been interested in me.

393
00:27:35,743 --> 00:27:38,363
She even told me not to contact her again in the future.

394
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:42,256
It's not the first time you're rejected. Practice makes perfect, right?

395
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,282
What do you know?

396
00:27:43,363 --> 00:27:46,105
When she rejected me before, we could still be good friends.

397
00:27:46,186 --> 00:27:48,585
But this time, she rejected me so firmly.

398
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,349
Maybe this time, you really don't have a chance.

399
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,220
That's not right, Qian.

400
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,550
Someone sent her flowers.

401
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:06,012
Do you think it could be someone else pursuing her?

402
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,019
- Isn't it too hot? - It is. It's a little too hot.

403
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,570
Oh, it's hot. Can you add cold water? Thank you.

404
00:28:12,594 --> 00:28:14,214
- Sure. - It's too hot.

405
00:28:15,072 --> 00:28:16,472
Forget it. Don't think about it.

406
00:28:16,552 --> 00:28:17,982
You can't figure it out.

407
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:21,639
I still can't give up.

408
00:28:22,248 --> 00:28:23,718
In my dictionary,

409
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,030
there's no "giving up."

410
00:28:26,953 --> 00:28:29,372
I need to recharge and prepare for tomorrow's battle.

411
00:28:32,352 --> 00:28:33,512
Wu,

412
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:34,922
I have a question to ask you.

413
00:28:35,328 --> 00:28:36,648
I have a friend...

414
00:28:36,752 --> 00:28:38,912
The one who thinks he's the sun, the crazy one, right?

415
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,300
No, another friend.

416
00:28:40,911 --> 00:28:41,953
This friend of mine

417
00:28:42,034 --> 00:28:43,631
was scolded by someone he considers important

418
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:45,929
for having no moral bottom line and only caring about money.

419
00:28:45,953 --> 00:28:47,232
What do you think he should do

420
00:28:47,348 --> 00:28:49,874
to improve his relationship with his friend?

421
00:28:50,016 --> 00:28:51,776
Isn't this simple?

422
00:28:51,926 --> 00:28:54,022
Ask your friend to meet with her more often and show more care.

423
00:28:54,046 --> 00:28:56,042
When she needs help, just be there for her.

424
00:28:56,123 --> 00:28:57,683
This question is so simple. Why ask me?

425
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,960
Think about it yourself. I need to rest and recharge.

426
00:29:02,193 --> 00:29:03,242
Sir,

427
00:29:04,168 --> 00:29:05,468
how do you feel?

428
00:29:05,736 --> 00:29:09,336
Many customers have said our environment is especially relaxing

429
00:29:09,485 --> 00:29:10,954
and also helps with sleep.

430
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,220
I don't think it's that great.

431
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,590
I think you should temporarily close for improvement.

432
00:29:17,614 --> 00:29:19,602
Sir, why are you saying this?

433
00:29:19,754 --> 00:29:21,842
Is there something that you're not satisfied with?

434
00:29:22,075 --> 00:29:24,312
Is it the water temperature or the herbs?

435
00:29:24,544 --> 00:29:27,173
Were the services you engaged before too high-end?

436
00:29:41,751 --> 00:29:45,282
In that case, please give us suggestions and we will make improvements.

437
00:29:45,399 --> 00:29:46,562
Never mind.

438
00:29:47,097 --> 00:29:48,457
It's just the person is not right.

439
00:31:07,381 --> 00:31:10,461
I haven't finished destressing yet.

440
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,082
But, your actions are really helpful to me. Just wait a little longer.

441
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:17,171
- You'll see the results. - Just wait a little longer? What results?

442
00:31:17,252 --> 00:31:19,562
Magic will happen soon.

443
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:21,679
You look pale.

444
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,922
Are you feeling unwell?

445
00:32:25,105 --> 00:32:27,375
No. Maybe I didn't sleep well. It's okay.

446
00:32:28,744 --> 00:32:31,294
(Number three, Chen Qing Mei.)

447
00:32:32,472 --> 00:32:33,772
They're calling your number.

448
00:32:38,072 --> 00:32:40,922
- Let me go. Bao, take care of my bag. - Okay.

449
00:32:52,552 --> 00:32:53,677
This is really great.

450
00:32:53,784 --> 00:32:55,282
Thank you, Lawyer Cheng.

451
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,012
How's the result?

452
00:33:01,093 --> 00:33:03,613
Dong Shan and the child are indeed from the same paternal line.

453
00:33:03,865 --> 00:33:05,122
The evidence is complete.

454
00:33:05,253 --> 00:33:06,602
We can prepare for the trial.

455
00:33:07,071 --> 00:33:08,462
Well done, Cheng Yao.

456
00:33:08,648 --> 00:33:10,425
You have made a great contribution this time.

457
00:33:10,449 --> 00:33:12,847
As long as we win, I promise you can surpass Yu Fei

458
00:33:12,928 --> 00:33:15,442
and become the top person under the boss after me.

459
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,150
Really.

460
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,362
Let's just drop Miss Chen off first.

461
00:33:19,472 --> 00:33:21,301
No need, I have someone coming to pick me up.

462
00:33:21,921 --> 00:33:23,042
Mei.

463
00:33:24,425 --> 00:33:26,191
How was it? Are you tired?

464
00:33:26,318 --> 00:33:27,402
Not tired.

465
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,242
But, Xie Ming,

466
00:33:29,338 --> 00:33:32,034
you have no idea the pressure I've been under these past few days.

467
00:33:32,184 --> 00:33:35,042
Everyone is calling me a home-wrecker, a seductress.

468
00:33:35,938 --> 00:33:39,122
Even my lawyer doesn't show a good attitude toward me.

469
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,502
Greetings, lawyers. Thank you very much for your assistance.

470
00:33:43,526 --> 00:33:45,489
However, I would like to clarify on behalf of Mei.

471
00:33:45,513 --> 00:33:46,961
She had a very difficult life before,

472
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:49,402
so she mistook Dong Shan's kindness for love.

473
00:33:50,024 --> 00:33:51,033
And, she didn't even know

474
00:33:51,114 --> 00:33:52,779
that Dong Shan's statement that he was single was a lie.

475
00:33:52,803 --> 00:33:53,810
I know Mei the best.

476
00:33:53,891 --> 00:33:55,925
She is so timid. How could she do such a thing?

477
00:33:56,166 --> 00:33:57,896
I hope you two won't discriminate against her

478
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,480
and will do your best to help her, winning this lawsuit for her.

479
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:04,274
Oh, we won't do that.

480
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,140
We're professional lawyers. We will definitely do our best

481
00:34:07,164 --> 00:34:08,882
to fight for the rights of our clients.

482
00:34:09,863 --> 00:34:12,002
That's good. Then, we'll be on our way.

483
00:34:13,944 --> 00:34:15,522
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

484
00:34:16,204 --> 00:34:17,999
If I had met you earlier, it would have been great.

485
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:19,323
It's not too late now.

486
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:24,023
This man... Is he her...

487
00:34:24,341 --> 00:34:25,482
Probably...

488
00:34:25,751 --> 00:34:27,377
She's a player,

489
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,962
killing two birds with one stone.

490
00:34:30,135 --> 00:34:31,527
Whoever sees this will be angry, right?

491
00:34:31,551 --> 00:34:33,971
Luckily, the boss isn't watching. Otherwise, he'd be fuming.

492
00:34:34,311 --> 00:34:35,631
I'm fuming on behalf of the boss.

493
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:40,562
Maybe in this world, people without limits live a little better.

494
00:34:40,706 --> 00:34:42,006
Let's go.

495
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:45,273
Yeah. I can't take it anymore.

496
00:34:45,353 --> 00:34:46,653
The plot twist was too sudden.

497
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,860
It's making me so angry.

498
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,430
This place is too remote.

499
00:34:55,592 --> 00:34:56,942
I can't even order a ride.

500
00:34:57,472 --> 00:34:59,811
I've been trying for so long. No one has been taking orders.

501
00:34:59,835 --> 00:35:01,746
What should we do? Walk back?

502
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,140
So sweet, huh?

503
00:35:27,361 --> 00:35:28,661
Very attentive, huh?

504
00:35:29,072 --> 00:35:31,072
Look. We're out here working on a case.

505
00:35:31,263 --> 00:35:33,402
But our boss is always concerned about us.

506
00:35:33,851 --> 00:35:35,762
Of course, he's mostly concerned about me.

507
00:35:36,672 --> 00:35:37,886
You see. This place is so remote,

508
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:40,070
and I was worried we wouldn't be able to catch a ride.

509
00:35:40,273 --> 00:35:41,873
But then, the boss showed up in his car.

510
00:35:43,112 --> 00:35:44,962
Sometimes I wonder

511
00:35:45,454 --> 00:35:46,889
if there's some kind of fate between us.

512
00:35:46,913 --> 00:35:48,082
Amazing.

513
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,402
Boss.

514
00:35:49,492 --> 00:35:51,722
You are always my god in my heart.

515
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,580
Just on the way.

516
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,880
Is it really on the way if it's so far off?

517
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:00,556
Then, it must be "on the way" wherever we go.

518
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,322
Cheng Yao.

519
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,701
Do you feel like we're in a special care car?

520
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,939
He takes care of you, all right?

521
00:36:11,033 --> 00:36:12,153
We can't say that.

522
00:36:12,233 --> 00:36:14,433
We can only say that he takes care of me more than you.

523
00:36:14,901 --> 00:36:16,322
He cares for his subordinates

524
00:36:16,692 --> 00:36:18,042
but is too shy to express it.

525
00:36:18,133 --> 00:36:20,124
After all, his position is high up.

526
00:36:22,133 --> 00:36:26,793
But, his actions and affection don't align. I understand.

527
00:36:27,017 --> 00:36:28,317
Bao Rui.

528
00:36:28,816 --> 00:36:30,360
If you say one more word,

529
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,871
I will throw you out of the window without stopping the car.

530
00:36:35,035 --> 00:36:36,919
He won't. He's just joking.

531
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,268
He's a lawyer. He knows the law.

532
00:36:38,292 --> 00:36:40,132
Throwing objects out of the window is illegal.

533
00:37:06,646 --> 00:37:08,326
This chair is made of real leather, right?

534
00:37:32,558 --> 00:37:34,410
Boss. Regarding Chen Qing Mei's case,

535
00:37:34,491 --> 00:37:37,051
I have already organized the evidence and sent it to your email.

536
00:37:37,112 --> 00:37:39,552
I don't know if there are any parts that need to be modified.

537
00:37:40,442 --> 00:37:42,042
I have checked them all on the way here.

538
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:43,566
The evidence is well-prepared.

539
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,880
You have considered it carefully. You've made progress.

540
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:48,053
Thank you, boss.

541
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,602
I was just following the steps

542
00:37:49,687 --> 00:37:51,687
and making changes according to your instructions.

543
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:59,405
Boss, where are you going?

544
00:37:59,824 --> 00:38:02,464
If it's not convenient for you, you can drop me off.

545
00:38:02,856 --> 00:38:04,156
I'm going back to the firm.

546
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,310
The firm is in the opposite direction of Bao Rui's residence.

547
00:38:10,008 --> 00:38:13,082
I suddenly remembered that an important document was left at the firm.

548
00:38:23,233 --> 00:38:24,322
Boss,

549
00:38:24,652 --> 00:38:26,212
have you been sleeping well these days?

550
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,202
Very well.

551
00:38:29,542 --> 00:38:31,051
I've had deep sleep every day.

552
00:38:32,929 --> 00:38:33,962
That's good.

553
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,696
At the same time, gender identification being conducted in Hong Kong

554
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,786
requires the submission of the parent's identity information

555
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:00,362
and the relevant persons' signatures.

556
00:39:00,527 --> 00:39:02,833
We have obtained the relevant evidence from Hong Kong

557
00:39:02,913 --> 00:39:05,213
as supporting evidence, forming a chain of evidence.

558
00:39:06,072 --> 00:39:07,482
We believe that...

559
00:39:09,346 --> 00:39:14,882
(Authorized Agent, Claimant)

560
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,442
(Judges, Presiding Judge, Secretary)

561
00:39:38,699 --> 00:39:41,642
(Defendant)

562
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:45,402
- The verdict will be announced now. - All rise.

563
00:39:47,236 --> 00:39:48,996
This court's judgment is as follows.

564
00:39:49,077 --> 00:39:51,398
It is determined that the fetus in Chen Qing Mei's abdomen

565
00:39:51,533 --> 00:39:54,522
has a biological relationship with Dong Shan.

566
00:39:55,121 --> 00:39:56,833
When dividing Dong Shan's inheritance,

567
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,749
the share of the fetus should be reserved.

568
00:40:00,126 --> 00:40:01,686
If you do not agree with this judgment,

569
00:40:01,763 --> 00:40:04,203
you may file an appeal with this court

570
00:40:04,313 --> 00:40:07,432
within 15 days from the date of delivery of the judgment

571
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,360
and provide copies according to the number of opposing parties.

572
00:40:10,653 --> 00:40:11,720
The appeal will be heard

573
00:40:11,833 --> 00:40:14,111
in the Intermediate People's Court of Jiangcheng City.

574
00:40:14,379 --> 00:40:16,370
The court is now adjourned.

575
00:40:30,672 --> 00:40:33,023
Bao, I'm going out for some fresh air.

576
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,060
Go ahead.

577
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:49,936
Make sure everything is packed.

578
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,260
Give it to me.

579
00:40:54,511 --> 00:40:55,811
Lawyer Qian.

580
00:40:58,712 --> 00:40:59,872
Lawyer Qian.

581
00:41:00,048 --> 00:41:01,728
I really want to thank you for this time.

582
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,046
If it weren't for you, I might have lost this lawsuit.

583
00:41:06,572 --> 00:41:09,322
If you have time, can I treat you to a meal?

584
00:41:09,447 --> 00:41:10,762
I don't think this is necessary.

585
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,522
Let's just treat the meal as commemorating Dong Shan together.

586
00:41:14,671 --> 00:41:15,842
Is that not allowed?

587
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:18,362
I'm sorry. My job is already done.

588
00:41:19,575 --> 00:41:21,802
I will send you the bill for the lawyer's fees.

589
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,202
Grandpa, is your heart made of stone?

590
00:41:28,269 --> 00:41:30,008
Mom has sacrificed so much for this family.

591
00:41:30,089 --> 00:41:31,468
When you were sick, she took care of you.

592
00:41:31,492 --> 00:41:34,151
But now, you're acknowledging an illegitimate child as your grandson.

593
00:41:34,175 --> 00:41:36,882
Min, he's not an illegitimate child.

594
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,322
He's your own younger brother.

595
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,842
I'm afraid that your father will have no heir

596
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,762
and the family business

597
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,882
will go to waste.

598
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,762
In the future, you need to take care of your brother.

599
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,800
No heir? Am I not your granddaughter?

600
00:41:52,144 --> 00:41:55,868
Okay. From today on, you are no longer my grandfather.

601
00:41:55,949 --> 00:41:58,249
From now on, the Dong family has no relationship with me whatsoever.

602
00:41:58,273 --> 00:41:59,793
You also have no relationship with me.

603
00:41:59,826 --> 00:42:02,642
- You stupid girl. - If you want to hit me, come and hit me.

604
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,042
Min, what are you doing?

605
00:42:05,433 --> 00:42:06,833
Dad, I'm sorry.

606
00:42:06,914 --> 00:42:08,682
Hurry and take him away.

607
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:11,353
- He is your grandfather. - Mom.

608
00:42:11,464 --> 00:42:13,134
What are you doing?

609
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,150
Thank you, Lawyer Cheng.

610
00:42:19,299 --> 00:42:21,991
Are lawyers all heartless?

611
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,762
Protecting the mistress

612
00:42:25,008 --> 00:42:26,517
but not the marriage?

613
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,562
I thought we were already friends.

614
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:30,922
Min.

615
00:42:31,127 --> 00:42:32,242
Miss Dong.

616
00:42:32,632 --> 00:42:34,342
Being a lawyer is just a profession.

617
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,664
Representing someone does not reflect the lawyer's personal stance.

618
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:40,528
The outcome of the case is not an excuse for you to insult my employee.

619
00:42:44,511 --> 00:42:45,682
Min,

620
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,710
don't blame Lawyer Qian and his employees.

621
00:42:47,889 --> 00:42:50,679
Blame it all on me.

622
00:42:51,803 --> 00:42:53,352
It's my carelessness.

623
00:42:53,526 --> 00:42:55,515
If only I had been more vigilant,

624
00:42:55,734 --> 00:42:56,962
the outcome

625
00:42:58,282 --> 00:43:00,082
wouldn't be like this today.

626
00:43:04,426 --> 00:43:06,074
I underestimated human nature

627
00:43:06,155 --> 00:43:07,955
and misjudged family ties.

628
00:43:09,161 --> 00:43:10,682
Remember this day.

629
00:43:10,828 --> 00:43:12,658
Remember this outcome.

630
00:43:13,158 --> 00:43:16,429
This is also an important lesson for your life.

631
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,962
You have to grow up.

632
00:43:19,253 --> 00:43:21,204
Mom can't accompany you forever.

633
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,082
All right. Let's go home with Mom.

634
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,042
Come on.

635
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,420
Did you get injured?

636
00:43:37,577 --> 00:43:38,682
No.

637
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:43,819
I'm really okay.
