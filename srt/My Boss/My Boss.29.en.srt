1
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,762
(My Boss)

2
00:01:39,812 --> 00:01:41,062
(Episode 29)

3
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:45,002
(Qian Heng, thank you for bringing me to your secret hideout.)

4
00:02:17,698 --> 00:02:18,918
Enough.

5
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:20,926
I suppose you guys are dying to know, huh?

6
00:02:26,308 --> 00:02:27,528
Hurry. To the pantry.

7
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:28,919
Let's go.

8
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,128
You had no idea. I sobered up immediately back then.

9
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:33,922
You were actually hugging and kissing Lawyer Qian.

10
00:02:35,351 --> 00:02:37,362
It was Lawyer Qian, you know? My goodness.

11
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,960
I turned around immediately.

12
00:02:42,768 --> 00:02:43,988
I didn't even dare to breathe in.

13
00:02:45,591 --> 00:02:48,762
I'm mainly curious about when you got together with our boss.

14
00:02:50,765 --> 00:02:52,537
Actually, Cheng Yao, when you first joined us,

15
00:02:52,632 --> 00:02:54,452
I thought you were someone with huge potential.

16
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,359
I didn't know you had this much potential.

17
00:02:56,726 --> 00:02:58,086
You actually became our lady boss.

18
00:03:04,104 --> 00:03:05,324
You think I have a point too, right?

19
00:03:05,414 --> 00:03:08,536
You see, our boss fired 13 female assistants in a row.

20
00:03:08,671 --> 00:03:10,202
But now, he's not firing you.

21
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,536
You tamed him successfully.

22
00:03:11,687 --> 00:03:12,898
Cheng Yao, I'm serious.

23
00:03:13,056 --> 00:03:14,602
You're truly impressive.

24
00:03:14,899 --> 00:03:17,060
You're amazing. You truly impressed me.

25
00:03:17,178 --> 00:03:19,177
Since he can fire 13 female assistants in a row,

26
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:21,300
I'm sure he can fire you now too.

27
00:03:24,227 --> 00:03:25,802
No.

28
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,522
He's joking.

29
00:03:27,899 --> 00:03:29,282
The joke is over.

30
00:03:29,899 --> 00:03:31,962
- Mainly, we...   - We didn't see anything.

31
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,882
All right. You guys can stop pretending since you already saw us.

32
00:03:37,387 --> 00:03:39,002
I'll treat you guys to lunch today.

33
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,522
You guys better keep it a secret.

34
00:03:41,339 --> 00:03:42,419
Thank you, boss.

35
00:03:42,499 --> 00:03:44,162
- Thank you, boss.   - Resume your work.

36
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,001
Yao Yao, my father wants me to go home tonight.

37
00:03:56,082 --> 00:03:57,760
He said there was an important event I needed to attend.

38
00:03:58,236 --> 00:03:59,395
I can't keep you company tonight.

39
00:03:59,483 --> 00:04:01,122
What would you like to have for lunch? I'll order them for you.

40
00:04:01,344 --> 00:04:02,482
Okay.

41
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:06,362
Let's eat.

42
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:11,339
There's actually fish-flavored shredded pork and sweet and sour pork ribs.

43
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,021
We craved them two days ago.

44
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,360
Thank you, boss.

45
00:04:19,147 --> 00:04:20,402
Boss, say,

46
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,020
am I no longer your beloved now?

47
00:04:23,516 --> 00:04:25,282
I suggest you don't get jealous of her.

48
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:26,599
You can't bear the consequences.

49
00:04:28,005 --> 00:04:30,725
I was joking. Don't tell me you guys believe in me?

50
00:04:31,314 --> 00:04:32,595
The love the boss shows me

51
00:04:32,676 --> 00:04:34,842
is a type of love that transcends all worldly desires.

52
00:04:35,267 --> 00:04:36,882
Boss, don't worry.

53
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,180
You can enjoy your relationship.

54
00:04:38,283 --> 00:04:41,322
I'm still here for Junheng & Co.

55
00:04:45,066 --> 00:04:46,286
Yu Fei, what are you doing?

56
00:04:47,165 --> 00:04:49,762
Boss is putting these dishes in front of Cheng Yao because she likes them.

57
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,499
Can't you read the air? Why are you shifting them away?

58
00:04:54,277 --> 00:04:55,842
Because Tan Ying loves them too.

59
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,720
He's so annoying.

60
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,962
You're so concerned about Tan Ying. Why don't you show me some concern?

61
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:04,282
They're an item, you know? Don't tell me you two are an item?

62
00:05:06,118 --> 00:05:07,762
Did you only realize that by now?

63
00:05:07,885 --> 00:05:09,105
Realize what?

64
00:05:12,325 --> 00:05:13,882
I didn't spill the beans.

65
00:05:15,219 --> 00:05:16,439
During our team-building event,

66
00:05:16,564 --> 00:05:18,242
Tan Ying pretended to have a sprained ankle

67
00:05:18,356 --> 00:05:20,415
so that she could spend more time with Yu Fei.

68
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:23,682
I think I sprained my ankle. I can't walk.

69
00:05:24,136 --> 00:05:25,522
The concern Yu Fei shows toward Tan Ying

70
00:05:25,603 --> 00:05:27,243
already exceeded the capacity of a normal colleague.

71
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,850
Last time, in front of the elevator,

72
00:05:28,964 --> 00:05:30,564
you were carrying her bag for her. Did you think I didn't see that?

73
00:05:30,645 --> 00:05:32,324
You're having hotpot again? Look at your pimples.

74
00:05:32,405 --> 00:05:33,625
Do I have pimples?

75
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:36,042
Boss, Cheng Yao.

76
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,480
I told you so.

77
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,902
Bao Rui, as a lawyer,

78
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,495
having a pair of keen eyes is very important.

79
00:05:47,576 --> 00:05:49,282
You still have plenty of space to improve.

80
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:53,199
Try this.

81
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,840
Cheng Yao,

82
00:05:56,972 --> 00:05:58,322
did you know about that?

83
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:00,879
I already told you before. You didn't believe in me.

84
00:06:02,356 --> 00:06:04,276
Yeah. We're dating each other now.

85
00:06:04,371 --> 00:06:05,611
Who are you trying to deceive?

86
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,589
Why don't you say that the four of us are dating each other?

87
00:06:08,353 --> 00:06:09,714
Enough. Let's eat.

88
00:06:24,954 --> 00:06:26,162
Dad.

89
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:27,522
(Yao Yao.)

90
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,140
Are you free tonight?

91
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,433
Yeah, I'm free tonight.

92
00:06:32,514 --> 00:06:35,019
- What's the matter?   - Your mother and I are in Jiangcheng today.

93
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:38,119
Come and have dinner with us tonight.

94
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:40,299
Why are you guys at Jiangcheng?

95
00:06:41,228 --> 00:06:43,308
Do you remember that eccentric classmate of mine?

96
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,860
(Yesterday was our class reunion.)

97
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,073
(We competed with each other the entire night.)

98
00:06:48,179 --> 00:06:49,602
But there wasn't a victor.

99
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:53,950
Today, I plan to ask him out and continue our contest.

100
00:06:54,031 --> 00:06:55,548
We'll compete with our kids.

101
00:06:56,843 --> 00:06:59,419
(I was thinking that I could win by numbers alone.)

102
00:06:59,796 --> 00:07:01,076
In the end, your sister was busy.

103
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:04,522
(So, please have dinner with us tonight.)

104
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,482
Put on the highest high heels you can find.

105
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,579
(I heard that his eccentric son)

106
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:11,339
was 186cm tall.

107
00:07:11,433 --> 00:07:13,693
We must be imposing enough and show them who's the boss.

108
00:07:15,004 --> 00:07:17,285
Put on your priciest outfit too.

109
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,259
If you don't have one, I'll transfer money to you.

110
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:21,559
Go and buy one now.

111
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:24,540
Anyway, tonight,

112
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,499
I must defeat him.

113
00:07:26,859 --> 00:07:28,079
Okay.

114
00:07:53,126 --> 00:07:54,346
Yao Yao?

115
00:07:55,773 --> 00:07:58,387
- What are you doing here?   - I only left for a short while.

116
00:07:58,468 --> 00:08:00,122
Who are you going to see in that fancy dress?

117
00:08:00,585 --> 00:08:02,585
No. I'm here to have dinner with my father.

118
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:04,122
I'm wearing my sister's outfit.

119
00:08:04,981 --> 00:08:06,322
You're here to see your father?

120
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:08,459
Don't tell me he arranged a blind date for you?

121
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:10,420
No. My father is having dinner with his friend.

122
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,940
He wants me to make him proud.

123
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,040
Don't be nervous.

124
00:08:15,572 --> 00:08:17,972
Who said I'm nervous? I was just asking.

125
00:08:19,043 --> 00:08:20,403
I'll go and find my father first.

126
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:21,759
You should go too.

127
00:08:26,428 --> 00:08:28,282
Yao Yao, you don't need to see me off.

128
00:08:28,795 --> 00:08:31,015
I'm already here. You should go and find your father.

129
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:35,442
My father's here too.

130
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,962
My son is a famous lawyer now. You know?

131
00:08:42,812 --> 00:08:46,333
Qian, stop bragging about your son wherever you go.

132
00:08:46,414 --> 00:08:47,481
Do you think he's outstanding?

133
00:08:47,563 --> 00:08:51,282
Listen, both of my daughters are lawyers.

134
00:08:51,413 --> 00:08:53,242
Both of your daughters are lawyers?

135
00:08:53,328 --> 00:08:56,158
Not only is my son a lawyer, but he's also the boss of a law firm.

136
00:08:56,239 --> 00:08:58,420
Both of your daughters can't compare to him.

137
00:08:58,523 --> 00:08:59,602
Listen.

138
00:08:59,729 --> 00:09:01,969
No matter how high his position is...

139
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:11,009
What are you doing here?

140
00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:12,789
Yao Yao,

141
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,938
didn't I tell you to break up

142
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:17,882
with this gigolo who cheated on you?

143
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:19,499
Who are you insulting here?

144
00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:20,699
He's my son.

145
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:22,819
Why would my son be a gigolo?

146
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:25,442
Didn't you see? He already has a girlfriend.

147
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:28,122
Mr. Qian.

148
00:09:30,452 --> 00:09:31,602
Yao Yao.

149
00:09:33,731 --> 00:09:34,951
Yao Yao.

150
00:09:35,204 --> 00:09:37,348
Didn't you tell me that he was poor

151
00:09:37,429 --> 00:09:38,660
and that he was working in another state?

152
00:09:38,754 --> 00:09:40,078
What's going on?

153
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,578
Did you say my son was working in another state?

154
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,459
This part of the plot is so exciting.

155
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:47,140
I think I saw this in a drama before.

156
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,282
Mom.

157
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,402
- Yao Yao.   - Mr. Qian.

158
00:09:50,484 --> 00:09:53,002
Are you truly his daughter?

159
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,976
Have you done a DNA test?

160
00:09:56,057 --> 00:09:57,579
- Dad!   - How could a person like you

161
00:09:57,659 --> 00:09:59,180
give birth to such a beautiful daughter?

162
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,579
Mind your words!

163
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:05,820
Listen. You're the one who should do a DNA test

164
00:10:06,292 --> 00:10:07,362
with this person.

165
00:10:07,443 --> 00:10:09,379
You guys look totally different.

166
00:10:09,469 --> 00:10:10,698
What a joke.

167
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:13,780
Everyone can tell that we're father and son.

168
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,244
Stop spouting nonsense.

169
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:17,068
You're the one spouting nonsense here.

170
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,065
Dad!

171
00:10:19,146 --> 00:10:20,922
Mr. Cheng, that's enough.

172
00:10:22,939 --> 00:10:24,020
Mr. Cheng and Mrs. Cheng.

173
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,979
Let me introduce myself again.

174
00:10:26,116 --> 00:10:28,722
I'm Qian Heng, a founding partner of Junheng & Co.

175
00:10:30,225 --> 00:10:31,586
I'm Cheng Yao's boss

176
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:32,935
and her boyfriend.

177
00:10:34,053 --> 00:10:35,802
There were some misunderstandings before this.

178
00:10:36,156 --> 00:10:37,722
However, Cheng Yao and I

179
00:10:37,952 --> 00:10:39,218
are serious about our relationship.

180
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,473
And, we have a great relationship.

181
00:10:40,554 --> 00:10:42,640
I hope we can receive recognition from both sides.

182
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,362
Yao Yao, look.

183
00:10:48,442 --> 00:10:50,247
You refused me when I gave it to you last time.

184
00:10:50,426 --> 00:10:52,979
This time, there's no way

185
00:10:53,204 --> 00:10:54,323
you can reject me.

186
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,642
You mustn't remove it, okay?

187
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,580
You're not allowed to remove it, okay?

188
00:11:04,941 --> 00:11:06,161
Qian Heng.

189
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:09,242
I bought this on my last trip.

190
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,458
Please don't mind the poor quality.

191
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:11,540
- Take it.   - No, I...

192
00:11:11,621 --> 00:11:13,442
Mrs. Cheng, this is too precious.

193
00:11:16,867 --> 00:11:18,148
- I won't stand on ceremony, then.   - Take it.

194
00:11:18,229 --> 00:11:19,402
Thank you.

195
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:23,699
All right. You guys should sit down first.

196
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:25,140
Yeah, sit down first.

197
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,700
We can sit down and talk.

198
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,859
Since it has already come to this,

199
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,521
let's not interfere

200
00:11:32,731 --> 00:11:35,132
with our children's relationship.

201
00:11:36,181 --> 00:11:37,341
Cheng Yao,

202
00:11:37,422 --> 00:11:39,661
although your father has bad taste,

203
00:11:39,742 --> 00:11:42,082
you have excellent taste.

204
00:11:42,193 --> 00:11:44,312
You took a liking to Heng immediately.

205
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:46,780
And, you even courted him.

206
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,460
You impress me.

207
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,339
You must be mistaken.

208
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,260
It's not that my daughter courted your son.

209
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,362
Your son was the one who courted my daughter.

210
00:11:56,443 --> 00:11:57,637
Listen.

211
00:11:57,816 --> 00:11:59,440
In order to court my daughter,

212
00:11:59,537 --> 00:12:01,457
your son rented the same unit as my daughter

213
00:12:01,539 --> 00:12:03,387
and tried to persuade her

214
00:12:03,504 --> 00:12:05,139
to join Junheng & Co.

215
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,500
Why?

216
00:12:06,786 --> 00:12:10,019
He did it so that he could make her fall in love with him.

217
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,895
What nonsense was that?

218
00:12:11,988 --> 00:12:13,922
Any normal people could tell

219
00:12:14,003 --> 00:12:15,842
that your daughter courted my son.

220
00:12:15,939 --> 00:12:18,300
Your son courted my daughter.

221
00:12:18,819 --> 00:12:20,090
No matter if your son courted my daughter

222
00:12:20,171 --> 00:12:22,090
- or the other way around...   - Enough.

223
00:12:22,196 --> 00:12:24,516
It doesn't matter who courted whom.

224
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,434
Most importantly, we're having dinner together today.

225
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:30,082
And, we might be in-laws in the future too.

226
00:12:30,231 --> 00:12:31,722
Here, Mrs. Cheng.

227
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,882
Thank you for raising such an outstanding daughter

228
00:12:33,981 --> 00:12:35,578
to be our daughter-in-law.

229
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:37,442
I like Cheng Yao a lot.

230
00:12:37,572 --> 00:12:38,771
Thank you. Come.

231
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:40,482
Thank you for the compliment.

232
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:42,420
Enough.

233
00:12:42,812 --> 00:12:44,892
Dear, that's enough of you.

234
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:48,002
Yeah. The children

235
00:12:48,381 --> 00:12:49,630
should be in charge of their relationship.

236
00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:52,482
I'm fine as long as the children are happy.

237
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:54,119
I have nothing to say.

238
00:12:54,939 --> 00:12:55,962
But Qian,

239
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,282
you still haven't learned

240
00:12:57,364 --> 00:12:59,060
how to be eloquent even after so long.

241
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:02,420
You should learn from your wife.

242
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,579
And, I never expected you

243
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,579
to end up like this one day.

244
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:08,940
Do you remember how you treated me when we were in school?

245
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,020
Look at you now.

246
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,682
After so many years,

247
00:13:11,763 --> 00:13:14,242
your son has to call me Dad too.

248
00:13:15,331 --> 00:13:16,618
Nonsense.

249
00:13:16,699 --> 00:13:19,002
How dare you talk about our school days?

250
00:13:19,126 --> 00:13:20,442
If you're that capable,

251
00:13:21,316 --> 00:13:22,562
drink up, then.

252
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,402
No one intimidates me when it comes to drinking.

253
00:13:25,578 --> 00:13:27,858
- Come on, then.   - Come on.

254
00:13:27,939 --> 00:13:29,202
Come.

255
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,602
Mr. Cheng, Mrs. Cheng.

256
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,922
Let me do it. My dad said he'd foot the bill.

257
00:13:51,003 --> 00:13:52,603
That's impossible.

258
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,729
Your father agreed to let us be together.

259
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,129
How could I let him foot the bill?

260
00:13:58,579 --> 00:13:59,799
All right, then.

261
00:14:00,253 --> 00:14:01,297
Mister, it's done.

262
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,402
Thank you.

263
00:14:03,128 --> 00:14:04,899
I intend to bring you to a special place.

264
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,200
Do you want to go there with me?

265
00:14:06,308 --> 00:14:07,482
Sure.

266
00:14:07,564 --> 00:14:08,784
But what about them?

267
00:14:09,907 --> 00:14:12,067
Do you wish to see them argue again?

268
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:13,642
Just let them drink by themselves.

269
00:14:14,147 --> 00:14:15,162
Let's go.

270
00:14:23,578 --> 00:14:25,944
Chen, long time no see.

271
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:31,042
Qian Heng?

272
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,320
This is?

273
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:37,460
You never brought a girl here before.

274
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:39,060
This is Cheng Yao, my girlfriend.

275
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,082
It's been so long since you came. I thought you died from overexhaustion.

276
00:14:47,182 --> 00:14:49,522
So you went and got yourself a girlfriend. Good for you.

277
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:51,642
Mind your words. Don't scare her.

278
00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:55,139
Mind my words?

279
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:57,674
Of all the people to tell me to mind my words,

280
00:14:57,755 --> 00:14:58,995
you're not one of them.

281
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,602
When you first came here,

282
00:15:00,698 --> 00:15:03,089
you said you wanted to teach me about law during our first conversation.

283
00:15:03,182 --> 00:15:05,579
You recited the law articles for five minutes straight.

284
00:15:05,659 --> 00:15:06,899
Did you mind your words back then?

285
00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:08,279
Enough.

286
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:12,402
He looks pretty good.

287
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:15,366
I guess he cured his insomnia.

288
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,842
And, I assume it's all thanks to you.

289
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,510
How did you know?

290
00:15:22,653 --> 00:15:25,294
I played such scenes before.

291
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:27,139
Are you an actor?

292
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,540
I did some idol dramas before.

293
00:15:34,299 --> 00:15:35,519
They weren't very popular.

294
00:15:37,698 --> 00:15:42,237
A cold and bossy CEO like him

295
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,020
is always conquered by a female lead like you.

296
00:15:46,939 --> 00:15:48,449
I played that role before.

297
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,490
Enough. Cut the chatter.

298
00:15:51,506 --> 00:15:54,466
This is my shop. Why should I shut up?

299
00:15:56,419 --> 00:15:57,579
By the way,

300
00:15:57,659 --> 00:16:00,140
regarding the vinyl records you bought from me,

301
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,619
an old man offered a high price for them.

302
00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:03,180
He said he wanted them at all costs.

303
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,779
Take them back. I'll split the profit with you.

304
00:16:05,987 --> 00:16:08,067
No. I've already gifted them away.

305
00:16:10,426 --> 00:16:12,386
You already gifted those treasures away?

306
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:14,840
Who did you gift it to? Does he understand how precious they are?

307
00:16:20,491 --> 00:16:22,451
You actually gave them away, huh?

308
00:16:22,757 --> 00:16:25,317
That person must be very special to you.

309
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,060
All right. Take your time.

310
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:33,802
I'll give you a discount if you see something you like.

311
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,419
- Thank you.   - A discount?

312
00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:36,779
You better give them to me for free.

313
00:16:36,859 --> 00:16:38,002
Let's go.

314
00:16:39,053 --> 00:16:40,162
Over here.

315
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,619
This place is really nice.

316
00:16:45,727 --> 00:16:48,663
Of course. This is my secret hideout.

317
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:49,999
Secret hideout?

318
00:16:52,468 --> 00:16:55,660
I wanted to bring you here after our date at the amusement park.

319
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,435
I would come here

320
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,059
whenever I couldn't sleep.

321
00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:03,162
Back then, I couldn't figure it out.

322
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:06,602
Although I didn't like to waste time,

323
00:17:06,763 --> 00:17:09,604
I like to do meaningless things together with you.

324
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,362
I feel very relaxed when I'm with you.

325
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,762
I never had this feeling before.

326
00:17:13,948 --> 00:17:16,362
Really? Am I that special?

327
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,922
Of course. Didn't Chen say so already?

328
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,660
That person must be very special to me.

329
00:17:36,204 --> 00:17:37,763
Yes, this is it.

330
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,882
I remember that you said you liked this band, right?

331
00:17:41,089 --> 00:17:42,445
You actually know that?

332
00:17:47,139 --> 00:17:48,900
I do like this band.

333
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:51,420
It's because I think their music is closely related to life.

334
00:17:51,819 --> 00:17:52,922
When I was young,

335
00:17:53,003 --> 00:17:55,403
I dreamt of being an outstanding lawyer.

336
00:17:55,539 --> 00:17:57,940
I could protect my sister and my family.

337
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,380
And, I can help those who need my help.

338
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:06,122
But after I joined this industry,

339
00:18:06,243 --> 00:18:08,864
I found out that it wasn't as simple as I thought.

340
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,779
But luckily, I joined Junheng & Co.

341
00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:12,079
I encountered you.

342
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:15,207
I'm getting closer and closer to my dream.

343
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:20,143
The equipment here is pretty good.

344
00:18:20,261 --> 00:18:21,444
Do you want to give it a try?

345
00:18:21,579 --> 00:18:22,602
Okay.

346
00:20:45,379 --> 00:20:46,562
Qian Heng.

347
00:20:47,315 --> 00:20:48,642
What do you need?

348
00:20:49,452 --> 00:20:50,672
(Cut to the chase.)

349
00:20:54,782 --> 00:20:58,444
I'm in huge trouble this time.

350
00:21:01,054 --> 00:21:02,682
Cheng Xi told me

351
00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:04,424
that her parents are here.

352
00:21:04,649 --> 00:21:06,049
And,

353
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,042
they insisted on having a meal with me.

354
00:21:09,619 --> 00:21:11,539
I couldn't turn them down.

355
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,842
(What should I do now?)

356
00:21:14,259 --> 00:21:16,419
I'm not mentally prepared yet.

357
00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:18,220
But now, I have to see her parents.

358
00:21:19,428 --> 00:21:20,916
Buddy, I never expected

359
00:21:21,027 --> 00:21:23,588
that I have to see her parents right now.

360
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,299
It's much faster than I expected.

361
00:21:32,869 --> 00:21:34,258
This is a huge deal indeed.

362
00:21:34,339 --> 00:21:35,962
Yeah.

363
00:21:36,982 --> 00:21:39,202
That's why I called you

364
00:21:39,347 --> 00:21:41,082
to ask for your opinion.

365
00:21:41,475 --> 00:21:42,882
(I have to meet her parents)

366
00:21:42,964 --> 00:21:44,082
and have a meal with them.

367
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:45,442
I can't go there empty-handed.

368
00:21:45,594 --> 00:21:47,074
It would be rude of me to do so.

369
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,160
What should I buy?

370
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:51,602
What about this? You can come and find me.

371
00:21:51,683 --> 00:21:53,842
I'm at the unit we rented when we started our business.

372
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,602
- Let's chat in person.   - All right.

373
00:21:57,259 --> 00:21:58,479
Wait for me.

374
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,420
We can discuss it in person.

375
00:22:22,579 --> 00:22:24,539
Qian Heng, you did a good job with the place.

376
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:28,754
Do you still remember? We worked

377
00:22:29,756 --> 00:22:31,877
at this living room here.

378
00:22:32,116 --> 00:22:34,030
Do you still remember the long desk we had?

379
00:22:34,111 --> 00:22:35,331
The working desk.

380
00:22:35,443 --> 00:22:36,842
We worked there every day.

381
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,580
I remember that you were a minimalist.

382
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,019
Look at you now.

383
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,624
This...

384
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:46,963
You've changed your style

385
00:22:48,139 --> 00:22:50,180
quite a lot, huh?

386
00:22:51,506 --> 00:22:53,008
You have the preference of a young girl now.

387
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,200
It's pretty good.

388
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:06,522
Why do you have a photo of Cheng Xi here?

389
00:23:07,925 --> 00:23:09,124
I know now.

390
00:23:09,243 --> 00:23:10,842
You left it there on purpose so that I could see it, right?

391
00:23:11,004 --> 00:23:13,642
You missed me. You want me to move back, huh?

392
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,442
Qian Heng, that's no longer possible.

393
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,682
According to my progress with Cheng Xi,

394
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,953
we'll get a marriage certificate

395
00:23:20,048 --> 00:23:22,082
after meeting her parents,

396
00:23:22,228 --> 00:23:23,448
you know?

397
00:23:23,685 --> 00:23:24,885
I'm not trying to criticize you here.

398
00:23:24,972 --> 00:23:26,291
But you're not young anymore.

399
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:29,719
You should stop thinking about work.

400
00:23:30,003 --> 00:23:31,242
You should consider your future.

401
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,642
I have no time to take care of single people like you after I get married.

402
00:23:34,756 --> 00:23:36,442
What will you do by then?

403
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,242
You're a sneaky brat indeed.

404
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,273
Qian Heng was always superior to me ever since we were in college.

405
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,780
He's always in first place while I'm in second place.

406
00:24:01,861 --> 00:24:03,447
After that, when we started working,

407
00:24:03,604 --> 00:24:04,820
he became famous

408
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:06,890
while I became the handyman of the company.

409
00:24:07,819 --> 00:24:09,860
I can only mock him

410
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,259
when it comes to having a relationship, you know?

411
00:24:12,794 --> 00:24:14,014
I never expected him to do this.

412
00:24:14,139 --> 00:24:16,460
Not only did he court my sister-in-law with the company's fund,

413
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,259
but he also met their parents one day earlier than me.

414
00:24:19,739 --> 00:24:21,180
I can't live with this.

415
00:24:22,579 --> 00:24:24,042
According to what I know,

416
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:26,019
he was more than one day earlier than you.

417
00:24:27,043 --> 00:24:28,402
Yao Yao told me

418
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,642
that he saw my parents before long ago.

419
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:33,299
If so, that means you knew about this too.

420
00:24:33,379 --> 00:24:35,940
I was the only one who was kept in the dark, huh?

421
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:37,279
Yeah, you're right.

422
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,302
I even bragged about it in front of him.

423
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,400
More than once.

424
00:24:47,891 --> 00:24:49,330
I'm such a clown.

425
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,979
They're even living in the same unit now.

426
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:53,460
To think that I was bragging about it.

427
00:24:53,763 --> 00:24:55,802
- Why was I bragging to him?   - Yeah.

428
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:04,420
You two are the founding partners of Junheng & Co, you know?

429
00:25:04,589 --> 00:25:06,988
Why are you guys acting like kids?

430
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:11,042
Although Qian Heng met my parents earlier than you,

431
00:25:11,283 --> 00:25:13,844
you're better than him

432
00:25:14,463 --> 00:25:16,282
when it comes to making the elderly happy.

433
00:25:16,579 --> 00:25:17,799
But of course.

434
00:25:18,109 --> 00:25:20,522
With that personality of his,

435
00:25:20,692 --> 00:25:23,372
I'll definitely get the chance to mock him in the future.

436
00:25:23,854 --> 00:25:26,242
Besides, he has to call me his brother-in-law too.

437
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:28,242
I feel happy thinking about it.

438
00:25:35,341 --> 00:25:36,739
(Lawyer Wu, your HR Department)

439
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,042
(has completed my recruitment procedure.)

440
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,860
(I'm looking forward to seeing you next Monday.)

441
00:25:44,653 --> 00:25:46,002
I'm done for this time.

442
00:25:59,708 --> 00:26:01,522
We have to be pragmatic. Don't get all theoretical.

443
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:03,610
We have to give our clients a clear result.

444
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,180
All right. File a lawsuit, then.

445
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,739
You have to see what the plaintiff is filing a lawsuit for.

446
00:26:12,819 --> 00:26:14,539
First, find appropriate evidence.

447
00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:16,842
Second, check their evidence chain to see if there are any loopholes.

448
00:26:16,925 --> 00:26:18,322
Attack them from both directions.

449
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,940
Are all these cases handled by the same court?

450
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,259
All right. I'll submit the cases by the end of this month.

451
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:34,079
Here.

452
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,440
Thank you.

453
00:26:36,613 --> 00:26:38,562
Lawyer Wu is busy this morning. He'll arrive later.

454
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,202
I'll print the material and distribute it to you guys later.

455
00:26:41,379 --> 00:26:42,779
- What?   - Thanks.

456
00:26:42,889 --> 00:26:44,210
Did Lawyer Wu apply for leave?

457
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:46,499
That shouldn't be.

458
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,901
I heard that he ordered a set of new suit lately.

459
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,100
He wouldn't miss out on a chance

460
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,579
to show off his new suit in front of all his colleagues.

461
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,660
I guess there's more to it than meets the eye.

462
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,779
We have a task that we're working on together with Lawyer Wu.

463
00:26:58,897 --> 00:27:00,577
But he switched off his phone.

464
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:02,039
He switched off his phone?

465
00:27:02,347 --> 00:27:03,642
What's wrong? Is someone collecting debt from him?

466
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:05,202
Cheng Yao, do you know what's going on?

467
00:27:05,917 --> 00:27:07,637
What debt?

468
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,979
Were you even listening?

469
00:27:10,059 --> 00:27:12,420
This is a modern show, not a period drama.

470
00:27:14,579 --> 00:27:16,882
But I did encounter a heroine at the elevator this morning.

471
00:27:17,028 --> 00:27:18,099
Her words were like daggers,

472
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,299
and she had a domineering aura.

473
00:27:19,379 --> 00:27:21,940
I've never seen a heroine before.

474
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,539
Words like daggers? Isn't that...

475
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,680
- It's Lawyer Qian.   - It's different.

476
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,682
She has a gentle air too.

477
00:27:29,859 --> 00:27:33,299
So, it's a gentle female version of Lawyer Qian.

478
00:27:38,461 --> 00:27:41,181
All right. I have two announcements to make.

479
00:27:41,379 --> 00:27:42,779
Lawyer Liang?

480
00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:46,799
First, Li Meng resigned as she failed the assessment.

481
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:48,851
I hope that can serve as a warning.

482
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,779
Don't forget to have expectations for yourself.

483
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,481
Second, Junheng has a new business partner now.

484
00:27:53,562 --> 00:27:55,522
Let's welcome Lawyer Liang Yi Ran.

485
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,900
Hello, everyone. I'm Liang Yi Ran.

486
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,341
I believe I don't need to introduce myself...

487
00:28:03,459 --> 00:28:06,218
Is she the person who courted Lawyer Qian in college?

488
00:28:06,579 --> 00:28:09,322
Lawyer Liang is excellent at handling domestic cases.

489
00:28:09,435 --> 00:28:11,875
Junheng & Co completed a project together with her before.

490
00:28:12,349 --> 00:28:14,388
From today onward, she's one of us.

491
00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:16,939
I hope everyone can learn from her.

492
00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:24,842
(She became a partner of Junheng & Co at such a young age.)

493
00:28:25,088 --> 00:28:26,308
(She's amazing.)

494
00:28:30,382 --> 00:28:31,482
Come.

495
00:28:31,642 --> 00:28:33,322
Put your work aside.

496
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,499
Take a look at the lawyer's weekly volume.

497
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,362
Come and take a look.

498
00:28:37,539 --> 00:28:39,162
Junheng is all over

499
00:28:39,307 --> 00:28:40,547
this week's lawyer volume.

500
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:42,219
Give me one book.

501
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:43,519
What is it?

502
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:46,140
I have to say something.

503
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,940
Lawyer Liang is second-best when it comes to knowing Lawyer Qian.

504
00:28:49,028 --> 00:28:51,820
She requires no time to integrate herself into Junheng & Co.

505
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,562
Do you know how professional and capable one must be to achieve that?

506
00:28:54,685 --> 00:28:55,802
Second best, huh?

507
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,581
That means Lawyer Liang is right behind Lawyer Wu.

508
00:28:57,661 --> 00:28:58,979
That means Lawyer Liang is amazing.

509
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,860
Junheng's heir apparent, you're being modest today.

510
00:29:01,962 --> 00:29:03,841
Lawyer Wu? It's me.

511
00:29:04,139 --> 00:29:05,962
Forget it. It doesn't matter.

512
00:29:06,235 --> 00:29:08,156
Actually, I don't care

513
00:29:08,579 --> 00:29:10,122
who knows Lawyer Qian the most.

514
00:29:10,429 --> 00:29:12,172
I'm fine as Lawyer Qian knows me the most.

515
00:29:12,323 --> 00:29:13,884
I started praying silently

516
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,722
when I first worked together with Lawyer Liang.

517
00:29:16,065 --> 00:29:19,025
I thought to myself it would be great if we could cooperate again.

518
00:29:19,379 --> 00:29:20,979
Lawyer Qian read my mind.

519
00:29:21,122 --> 00:29:23,062
He recruited Lawyer Liang directly.

520
00:29:23,483 --> 00:29:25,002
He must've spent a lot of effort in doing so.

521
00:29:29,423 --> 00:29:31,314
(So, she's the only person in college)

522
00:29:31,455 --> 00:29:33,459
(who can compete with Lawyer Qian.)

523
00:29:33,697 --> 00:29:34,739
It's our first meeting today.

524
00:29:34,819 --> 00:29:36,180
I'm buying you guys a drink.

525
00:29:36,273 --> 00:29:37,473
- Thank you, Lawyer Liang.   - Don't mention it.

526
00:29:37,579 --> 00:29:39,882
- Thank you, Lawyer Liang.   - Here.

527
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,380
- It's heavy.   - Thank you, Lawyer Liang.

528
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,802
- It's fine.   - It's okay.

529
00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:44,279
Lawyer Liang.

530
00:29:44,819 --> 00:29:47,202
We met before. Who am I?

531
00:29:47,299 --> 00:29:48,819
You're Lawyer Bao Rui.

532
00:29:51,531 --> 00:29:52,751
You're Tan Ying.

533
00:29:52,971 --> 00:29:54,570
Lawyer Liang, do you know me?

534
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,480
Tan Ying is the queen of Junheng & Co.

535
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,296
She looks strict and boring on the surface.

536
00:29:59,377 --> 00:30:02,145
But she delivers when she's at the court.

537
00:30:02,226 --> 00:30:03,259
Yu Fei.

538
00:30:03,339 --> 00:30:04,739
Lawyer Liang, you flatter me.

539
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:08,243
And, I heard that you two appear together often.

540
00:30:08,964 --> 00:30:10,184
Lawyer Liang,

541
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:12,233
I thought you would be strict in private.

542
00:30:12,331 --> 00:30:14,847
I didn't expect you to be so nosy.

543
00:30:14,928 --> 00:30:16,367
You're unlike Lawyer Qian.

544
00:30:18,252 --> 00:30:20,082
You must be Cheng Yao.

545
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:23,124
I thought you were cute when I saw you in front of the elevator.

546
00:30:23,227 --> 00:30:25,387
Many people in the industry said you were a rising star.

547
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,103
It's no wonder Lawyer Qian, who never hired female assistants,

548
00:30:28,184 --> 00:30:29,545
made an exception for you.

549
00:30:30,571 --> 00:30:33,072
We can indeed learn a lot from Lawyer Qian.

550
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,420
But Bao shared a lot of

551
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,059
your working concepts with us when he came back.

552
00:30:38,139 --> 00:30:40,165
Lawyer Liang, I still have a lot to learn from you in the future.

553
00:30:40,555 --> 00:30:41,951
- Thank you.   - Look at the cover.

554
00:30:42,032 --> 00:30:43,860
Lawyer Liang and Lawyer Qian look like a perfect match.

555
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,160
Precisely.

556
00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:49,979
There are actually Magazine A and B, and they're independent.

557
00:30:50,075 --> 00:30:51,402
But they cut their budget.

558
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,100
They tried something peculiar in order to attract potential lawyers.

559
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,682
To avoid misunderstanding, Bao Rui,

560
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:58,162
keep away all of the weekly lawyer volumes.

561
00:31:00,717 --> 00:31:01,937
Stop reading it.

562
00:31:02,204 --> 00:31:03,922
Stop reading them.

563
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:08,779
Indeed. The interview was a little bit hasty.

564
00:31:09,774 --> 00:31:11,341
Lawyer Liang, since you have already joined our law firm,

565
00:31:11,421 --> 00:31:13,082
I can ask you directly in the future

566
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:14,682
if I have any questions related to trust.

567
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,700
- No problem.   - Can't I answer your questions?

568
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:20,019
I should ask a trust expert for that.

569
00:31:22,392 --> 00:31:24,362
I think I have a question too.

570
00:31:24,506 --> 00:31:25,986
- What question?   - I have a question too.

571
00:31:26,067 --> 00:31:27,094
Me too.

572
00:31:27,175 --> 00:31:28,804
Me too.

573
00:31:28,924 --> 00:31:30,524
Okay. I'll answer you guys one by one.

574
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,420
How did you become this outstanding?

575
00:31:33,515 --> 00:31:35,195
Can you take a look for me?

576
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:36,682
I wish to ask you something.

577
00:31:37,299 --> 00:31:39,480
Boss, I have no questions for her.

578
00:31:39,819 --> 00:31:41,259
It's because I gave you all my heart.

579
00:31:41,715 --> 00:31:43,814
Give me the weekly lawyer volume.

580
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:48,890
Thank you, Lawyer Liang.

581
00:31:59,134 --> 00:32:00,574
You're creating trouble for yourself.

582
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,200
Come in.

583
00:32:05,517 --> 00:32:06,562
Senior.

584
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:08,810
- Lawyer Liang.   - I brought you a gift.

585
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,940
This is our college's 80th commemorative album.

586
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,960
Our professor told me to give it to you.

587
00:32:16,547 --> 00:32:17,767
Thank him on my behalf.

588
00:32:18,379 --> 00:32:19,599
Don't you want to take a look?

589
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,459
Everyone has a limited amount of memory.

590
00:32:23,572 --> 00:32:25,712
I only wish to remember the clients who pay me

591
00:32:25,793 --> 00:32:27,042
and the employees who work for me.

592
00:32:27,139 --> 00:32:28,340
I will attend the alumni dinner.

593
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,940
But I don't have time to remember all of their faces.

594
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,219
Indeed.

595
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:34,340
Since we can see them,

596
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,759
there's no need to waste any time remembering them.

597
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:40,299
However, this is the only gift of its kind in the world.

598
00:32:41,103 --> 00:32:42,282
I remember

599
00:32:42,363 --> 00:32:44,402
that you loved the Lady Justice statue in our college.

600
00:32:44,499 --> 00:32:45,719
You often go and take pictures there.

601
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,180
After that, the college changed its address.

602
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,980
I hired someone to get a piece of its base and turned it into this.

603
00:32:50,075 --> 00:32:51,554
I prepared it as a surprise for you.

604
00:32:52,932 --> 00:32:54,152
To be honest with you,

605
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:56,724
my mother donated the statue to our college.

606
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:58,340
The statue was built based on my grandmother's face.

607
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,900
She ordered me to go there once per week.

608
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,019
One day, she suddenly got terrified of the statue.

609
00:33:03,161 --> 00:33:04,381
She told someone to demolish it.

610
00:33:06,508 --> 00:33:07,728
Thanks for the gift.

611
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:09,379
But Lawyer Liang, I'm sorry.

612
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,802
I'll be meeting a client later.

613
00:33:10,892 --> 00:33:12,112
I can't keep you company.

614
00:33:14,819 --> 00:33:15,820
By the way,

615
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:18,319
I'll tell Bao Rui to dispose of this. You won't mind, right?

616
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,322
I just wish to promote my image

617
00:33:23,403 --> 00:33:25,162
since I'm new to the company.

618
00:33:25,251 --> 00:33:26,922
Senior, you don't mind bringing me around, right?

619
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:28,299
It's not your issue.

620
00:33:28,431 --> 00:33:30,779
It's just that the magazine firm didn't fulfill their promise.

621
00:33:30,859 --> 00:33:32,699
They even photoshopped our pictures and put them together.

622
00:33:32,822 --> 00:33:34,962
I will recommend you directly if there's any magazine shoot next time.

623
00:33:35,043 --> 00:33:36,219
You will represent the law firm.

624
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:37,519
I hate this type of activity the most.

625
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,700
Don't worry. I saw how hardworking you are.

626
00:33:41,059 --> 00:33:42,920
We'll hold a welcoming dinner for you tonight.

627
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,400
Thank you, Senior.

628
00:34:17,149 --> 00:34:18,242
Club leader,

629
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,700
does Senior Qian Heng have a girlfriend?

630
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,535
I heard that he won the contest several times in a row.

631
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,897
If I join the club,

632
00:34:24,978 --> 00:34:27,078
will I be able to train together with him?

633
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:29,842
I'm very happy to join the debate club.

634
00:34:29,948 --> 00:34:32,367
Senior Qian Heng, I will defeat you.

635
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,779
All right. I'll wait for you.

636
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:47,962
I saw the last contest. You did great.

637
00:34:49,059 --> 00:34:50,279
Thank you, Senior.

638
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:55,100
It's been so many years.

639
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:57,140
We're finally standing side by side.

640
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,162
(Yi Ran, I'll send you the address of the restaurant later.)

641
00:35:07,231 --> 00:35:08,451
(See you tonight.)

642
00:35:26,941 --> 00:35:28,161
What's on your mind?

643
00:35:32,034 --> 00:35:35,163
I was thinking that a female partner finally joined our law firm.

644
00:35:35,244 --> 00:35:36,763
I must learn from her.

645
00:35:38,739 --> 00:35:39,959
I have great taste, right?

646
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:43,799
But you can learn from me if you need to learn something.

647
00:35:44,628 --> 00:35:46,629
Although Liang Yi Ran is good at her job,

648
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:49,540
I'm at another level when it comes to teaching people.

649
00:35:50,204 --> 00:35:51,482
It's hard to say.

650
00:35:51,592 --> 00:35:53,593
Lawyer Liang is much more approachable.

651
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,059
And, she can answer deep questions in simple ways.

652
00:35:57,169 --> 00:35:58,922
- Can you do that?   - I...

653
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,160
If only I were as outstanding as Lawyer Liang.

654
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:07,315
Am I not superior to her?

655
00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:21,500
Why do I smell a hint of jealousy?

656
00:36:22,163 --> 00:36:23,383
Who said so?

657
00:36:25,546 --> 00:36:26,827
Stop getting jealous.

658
00:36:26,915 --> 00:36:30,115
I think Lawyer Qian didn't hire Lawyer Liang for the reason you think.

659
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,739
I'm not jealous.

660
00:36:33,297 --> 00:36:36,558
I did that to focus on work.

661
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:42,402
But I'm envious of Lawyer Liang's confidence.

662
00:36:43,219 --> 00:36:44,527
But what's the use of being jealous?

663
00:36:44,608 --> 00:36:46,562
Working hard is the most important thing.

664
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,539
Do you know who achieved top sales this month?

665
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:53,659
- Who is it?   - Who is it?

666
00:36:53,739 --> 00:36:54,959
I took a look just now.

667
00:36:55,659 --> 00:36:56,879
It was me.

668
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,520
Congratulations.

669
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:03,619
I believe that I'll be replacing Lawyer Liang

670
00:37:03,768 --> 00:37:05,968
on the magazine cover

671
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:07,477
in a few more years.

672
00:37:08,307 --> 00:37:09,626
Cheng Yao, I have confidence in you.

673
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:12,969
I'm sure you'll be on the magazine cover in ten years.

674
00:37:13,219 --> 00:37:14,602
To put it strictly, Lawyer Qian and Lawyer Liang

675
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:16,091
are on equal terms now.

676
00:37:16,219 --> 00:37:18,220
They're still equal in terms of ability after five years.

677
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,740
Five years?

678
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,242
Don't think that far yet.

679
00:37:21,427 --> 00:37:23,347
Just think about the present. Let's have a feast today.

680
00:37:23,435 --> 00:37:25,594
Bao Rui, you achieved top sales, right?

681
00:37:25,675 --> 00:37:27,562
- Treat us to dinner.   - No problem.

682
00:37:27,699 --> 00:37:30,100
Eat away. It's my treat.

683
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,600
But...

684
00:37:35,179 --> 00:37:37,162
Only the four of us, all right?

685
00:37:37,908 --> 00:37:39,442
Let's come back and work overtime after that.

686
00:37:41,444 --> 00:37:43,122
Come. Don't stand on ceremony.

687
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,916
Wait.

688
00:37:44,997 --> 00:37:46,117
Wait.

689
00:37:46,198 --> 00:37:48,122
Where's the shrimp paste I put?

690
00:37:50,317 --> 00:37:52,517
- Where is it?   - You didn't order shrimp paste.

691
00:37:54,013 --> 00:37:55,233
Didn't I?

692
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,200
I think I ordered it.

693
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:59,026
What about the tripe I put?

694
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:00,779
I think it's still unprocessed.

695
00:38:01,452 --> 00:38:02,652
Didn't I order tripe just now?

696
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,783
You only ordered the soup base for our boiled fish with pickled cabbage.

697
00:38:04,868 --> 00:38:06,468
You didn't order any other food.

698
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,242
Isn't pickled cabbage a kind of food?

699
00:38:11,619 --> 00:38:13,579
Can you order something normal for once?

700
00:38:13,659 --> 00:38:15,280
Like bamboo shoots, lotus roots, and baby Chinese cabbage.

701
00:38:15,361 --> 00:38:16,800
We should have a balanced diet.

702
00:38:19,385 --> 00:38:20,605
Great words.

703
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:22,666
Speaking of a balanced diet, I was reminded of something.

704
00:38:22,747 --> 00:38:25,386
Junheng & Co is finally balanced now.

705
00:38:27,249 --> 00:38:29,971
In the past, all of our partners are guys.

706
00:38:30,059 --> 00:38:31,220
Now, there's a female partner.

707
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,980
The gender count is finally balanced.

708
00:38:33,099 --> 00:38:34,602
And, in my heart, Lawyer Liang is...

709
00:38:34,683 --> 00:38:35,884
- Have some water.   - I'm not thirsty.

710
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,139
- You are.   - I'm not.

711
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,581
You are.

712
00:38:42,437 --> 00:38:43,957
I feel thirsty all of a sudden.

713
00:38:45,917 --> 00:38:47,642
Cheng Yao, you see,

714
00:38:47,739 --> 00:38:49,879
you're Lawyer Qian's girlfriend, right?

715
00:38:50,179 --> 00:38:51,659
Lawyer Liang is his partner.

716
00:38:51,777 --> 00:38:53,917
So, you guys aren't on the same track.

717
00:38:54,244 --> 00:38:55,464
That's right.

718
00:38:55,739 --> 00:38:57,100
Think about it this way.

719
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,899
He can only have you as his girlfriend.

720
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,019
But he can have plenty of female business partners.

721
00:39:03,099 --> 00:39:04,780
- I think you're thirsty.   - Yeah, I should drink.

722
00:39:04,944 --> 00:39:07,260
He's trying to say that work is just a minor part of life.

723
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,740
You can think about

724
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,786
the joy of dating Lawyer Qian outside of work.

725
00:39:12,241 --> 00:39:13,762
Yeah. That's what I mean.

726
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:15,851
It's fine.

727
00:39:15,938 --> 00:39:17,337
I'm not infatuated with love.

728
00:39:17,699 --> 00:39:19,482
I think I should strive to improve myself.

729
00:39:19,551 --> 00:39:21,030
I can't just focus solely on my relationship.

730
00:39:21,732 --> 00:39:22,812
You're not infatuated with love?

731
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,002
Yeah.

732
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,879
I wonder who was the person

733
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,099
who pestered Lawyer Qian and asked for kisses and hugs

734
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:31,819
during our team-building event?

735
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,928
Do you expect me to carry you around again

736
00:39:37,009 --> 00:39:39,042
if you get drunk tonight?

737
00:39:41,699 --> 00:39:42,860
Lawyer Qian, what a coincidence.

738
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,819
Are you here to have dinner too?

739
00:39:45,659 --> 00:39:47,020
Bao Rui is buying us a meal today.

740
00:39:47,539 --> 00:39:49,819
I think we'll opt out of the conversation now.

741
00:39:50,162 --> 00:39:52,203
- Yeah, let's go.   - You guys haven't eaten yet.

742
00:39:52,284 --> 00:39:54,122
- It's fine. We'll order food delivery.   - I'm not that hungry.

743
00:40:02,516 --> 00:40:03,736
Boss, it's like this.

744
00:40:03,918 --> 00:40:05,922
I'm buying them this meal.

745
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,740
Theoretically speaking, I already paid for it.

746
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,402
I think I can listen to your conversation.

747
00:40:09,483 --> 00:40:10,900
- Am I right?   - Leave.

748
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,200
Sorry for bothering you.

749
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,042
I didn't get to take a single bite.

750
00:40:16,489 --> 00:40:18,139
What are you doing? They haven't eaten yet.

751
00:40:18,219 --> 00:40:20,500
- They're full.   - But they haven't eaten yet.

752
00:40:24,106 --> 00:40:25,882
Is Lawyer Liang's welcoming dinner over?

753
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,420
The welcoming dinner is still ongoing.

754
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,720
But I don't necessarily need to go.

755
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,717
I heard that my girlfriend was working overtime.

756
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:34,018
I'm here to keep her company.

757
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:35,842
You want to keep me company?

758
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:40,379
Can you cook for me at home?

759
00:40:41,142 --> 00:40:43,482
We're having hotpot here. Why do you need me to cook?

760
00:40:46,187 --> 00:40:48,762
I didn't have lunch. I think I'm suffering from gastric.

761
00:40:48,996 --> 00:40:51,076
I want to eat the porridge you make.

762
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:53,442
What should we do about this, then?

763
00:40:53,796 --> 00:40:55,016
I want to have porridge.

764
00:40:57,612 --> 00:40:58,922
- Let's go back.   - Let's go.

765
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:06,220
Come on, hurry.

766
00:41:06,451 --> 00:41:08,410
What a waste.

767
00:41:08,659 --> 00:41:11,179
Eat up. You wanted vegetables, right?

768
00:41:11,259 --> 00:41:13,002
I ordered pickled cabbage. Free refill for pickled cabbage.

769
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,320
But not the fish.

770
00:41:17,797 --> 00:41:19,162
Let's leave after eating.

771
00:41:23,219 --> 00:41:24,979
Have the porridge by yourself once it's done.

772
00:41:25,059 --> 00:41:26,299
I have some materials to read.

773
00:41:26,741 --> 00:41:28,312
Why the rush?

774
00:41:28,693 --> 00:41:30,642
I was motivated by Lawyer Liang.

775
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:33,459
I want to be an outstanding lawyer like her as soon as possible.

776
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,000
Yao Yao,

777
00:41:39,292 --> 00:41:40,512
I'm sorry.

778
00:41:43,035 --> 00:41:44,035
As your boyfriend,

779
00:41:44,116 --> 00:41:45,638
I shouldn't have gone to a photoshoot

780
00:41:45,734 --> 00:41:47,682
with another girl without your permission.

781
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,299
I've made you angry and upset.

782
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,459
I didn't want to attend the photoshoot.

783
00:41:51,573 --> 00:41:54,260
That's why I had been in a bad mood after the photoshoot.

784
00:41:54,341 --> 00:41:55,420
I forgot to tell you about it.

785
00:41:55,539 --> 00:41:58,319
Of course, it's my fault for forgetting it.

786
00:41:58,732 --> 00:42:01,580
But I'm willing to do a photoshoot with you if you're willing.

787
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,539
If you're envious of her,

788
00:42:03,619 --> 00:42:04,940
I'll tell Wu Jun to contact them.

789
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:07,282
We'll do the photoshoot for the next volume, okay?

790
00:42:07,539 --> 00:42:10,139
That's why you were in a hurry to deal with the issue.

791
00:42:10,219 --> 00:42:11,739
You thought I was jealous, huh?

792
00:42:17,828 --> 00:42:19,322
Sorry about that.

793
00:42:19,563 --> 00:42:22,540
Are you a fool? Of course I won't get jealous because of that.

794
00:42:25,148 --> 00:42:27,362
The porridge will be burnt if you don't let go of me.

795
00:42:28,388 --> 00:42:29,427
Are you sure you're not jealous?

796
00:42:29,539 --> 00:42:30,859
Yeah.

797
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,000
All right, then.

798
00:42:33,236 --> 00:42:34,713
I just admire Lawyer Liang

799
00:42:34,968 --> 00:42:36,802
from a work perspective.

800
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,322
As for our relationship,

801
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,882
I think our personalities suit each other better.

802
00:42:45,339 --> 00:42:46,659
Have it yourself. Be careful. It's hot.

803
00:42:46,746 --> 00:42:48,282
I'll return to my room to read the materials now.

804
00:42:49,005 --> 00:42:50,307
Why are you returning to your room?

805
00:42:50,388 --> 00:42:51,909
You can read them beside me.

806
00:42:52,021 --> 00:42:53,602
No. You're too handsome.

807
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,475
I can't focus on my work with you by my side.

808
00:42:59,211 --> 00:43:01,602
Why was she so honest?

809
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:13,040
It's so hot.
