1
00:01:35,593 --> 00:01:38,802
(My Boss)

2
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:41,639
(Episode 27)

3
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,322
(Cheng Yao, happy birthday to you.)

4
00:01:51,046 --> 00:01:52,731
- Brother-in-law.   - Former brother-in-law.

5
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:54,032
Wipe your hands.

6
00:01:56,824 --> 00:01:58,464
I'm telling you to stop bothering me.

7
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,228
If you do so, I won't show you mercy in court.

8
00:02:00,309 --> 00:02:02,121
Okay. I just thought about it.

9
00:02:02,202 --> 00:02:03,562
My behavior did cross the line.

10
00:02:03,676 --> 00:02:04,844
Sorry about that.

11
00:02:04,935 --> 00:02:07,322
I bought two drinks, black tea and coffee.

12
00:02:07,403 --> 00:02:08,958
I don't know which one you like, so I bought both.

13
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,522
Please accept my apology.

14
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:12,922
Coffee, then. I don't drink red tea either.

15
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:15,224
You can have both. You can't drink inside the courtroom,

16
00:02:15,305 --> 00:02:16,602
you'll be thirsty when you come out.

17
00:02:17,726 --> 00:02:20,482
I also have some small cookies and compressed bread here.

18
00:02:22,136 --> 00:02:23,802
Remember to drink when you come out.

19
00:02:31,998 --> 00:02:34,031
(Court of First Instance)

20
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,641
This court hereby rules that

21
00:03:21,152 --> 00:03:24,095
the evidence submitted by plaintiff Lin Feng Juan

22
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,840
is not sufficient to prove the paternity

23
00:03:26,012 --> 00:03:29,016
between her son and the defendant Lu Jian.

24
00:03:29,238 --> 00:03:30,936
Lin Feng Juan's lawsuit request

25
00:03:31,017 --> 00:03:34,535
lacks corresponding evidence support and legal basis.

26
00:03:34,646 --> 00:03:36,842
This court rejects it.

27
00:03:37,081 --> 00:03:38,757
If you do not agree with this judgment,

28
00:03:38,866 --> 00:03:42,386
you may submit an appeal to this court within 15 days

29
00:03:42,467 --> 00:03:45,095
from the date of delivery of the judgment.

30
00:03:45,296 --> 00:03:48,857
Please provide copies corresponding to the number of litigants

31
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:52,336
appealing to the Intermediate People's Court of Jiangcheng.

32
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,837
Now, the court is adjourned.

33
00:03:56,976 --> 00:03:59,162
Congratulations, Mr. Lu.

34
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,562
You're amazing, Lawyer Deng.

35
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:03,002
It's nothing.

36
00:04:04,816 --> 00:04:06,036
It's going to be fine.

37
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,002
How about it, Mr. Lu?

38
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,442
I did what I said, right?

39
00:04:15,112 --> 00:04:17,962
Lawyer Deng, you're really amazing.

40
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,522
Oh, by the way, I have already booked a celebration banquet.

41
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:30,956
Please join us.

42
00:04:31,056 --> 00:04:33,522
Sure. Then, let's not drink soft drinks.

43
00:04:35,056 --> 00:04:37,055
You are so thoughtful, Lawyer Deng.

44
00:04:42,576 --> 00:04:43,935
If there's nothing to eat,

45
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,522
let's go to the celebration banquet together.

46
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,282
Ms. Lin.

47
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:55,762
As long as the information you provide is all true,

48
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,002
we still have a great chance to win in the second trial.

49
00:04:58,152 --> 00:04:59,372
Second trial?

50
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,762
Lawyer Deng, do you usually prefer white or red wine?

51
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:10,682
We will soon have a paternity test as new evidence.

52
00:05:11,223 --> 00:05:12,443
What's wrong, Lawyer Deng?

53
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,400
Cheng Yao, did you set me up?

54
00:05:22,944 --> 00:05:24,442
How is that considered setting you up?

55
00:05:24,694 --> 00:05:27,242
Everything your client has done is voluntary. No one is being coerced.

56
00:05:27,336 --> 00:05:29,717
I legally and reasonably obtained evidence. Is there a problem?

57
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,468
Obtaining evidence?

58
00:05:33,608 --> 00:05:35,128
Don't joke around, okay?

59
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:36,762
This is a court.

60
00:05:36,842 --> 00:05:38,202
There are so many people coming and going.

61
00:05:38,288 --> 00:05:40,882
How can you be sure that this bottle of drink was consumed by my client?

62
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,322
Right. This is a court.

63
00:05:43,415 --> 00:05:44,642
There are CCTVs everywhere.

64
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,200
The evidence was captured very clearly.

65
00:05:46,336 --> 00:05:48,523
Now, your concern should be how to explain the cryptorchidism

66
00:05:48,604 --> 00:05:51,648
if Lu Jian and Han do indeed share a biological relationship.

67
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:53,602
And I want to remind you

68
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:56,175
that forging evidence can result in criminal liability.

69
00:05:56,455 --> 00:05:57,975
You won't be in this courtroom then.

70
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,602
Lawyer Cheng, the paternity test report will be available in about a week.

71
00:06:04,713 --> 00:06:06,434
We will call you then.

72
00:06:06,576 --> 00:06:07,796
Thank you for your hard work.

73
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,600
Lawyer Deng, this...

74
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,342
What are you guys doing? I haven't finished my drink yet.

75
00:06:17,423 --> 00:06:19,783
This is my stuff. Why can't I have my own stuff?

76
00:06:19,871 --> 00:06:21,506
This is my stuff. I haven't finished my drink yet.

77
00:06:21,587 --> 00:06:23,762
- Sir, please calm down.   - This is my stuff.

78
00:06:23,856 --> 00:06:25,882
I haven't finished my drink yet.

79
00:06:25,977 --> 00:06:28,476
Ms. Lin, please calm down.

80
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,242
- Lin Feng Juan!   - Lu Jian!

81
00:06:39,014 --> 00:06:40,234
This is a court.

82
00:06:41,726 --> 00:06:45,109
That slap was on behalf of Han and myself.

83
00:06:46,256 --> 00:06:47,644
The law is just.

84
00:06:47,725 --> 00:06:50,204
The law won't let go of shameful people like you.

85
00:06:50,455 --> 00:06:51,816
Fine, Lin Feng Juan.

86
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:54,366
Just wait for me.

87
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,322
Lawyer Cheng, we'll leave first.

88
00:06:59,855 --> 00:07:01,075
Thank you for your hard work.

89
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,282
Cheng Yao, aren't you good, huh?

90
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,615
Yes. This time, you tricked me.

91
00:07:12,138 --> 00:07:13,545
But don't think that just because you won against me once,

92
00:07:13,626 --> 00:07:15,186
you can rest easy.

93
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,842
The road ahead is long.

94
00:07:17,775 --> 00:07:18,995
Let's wait and see.

95
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,419
Okay, Brother-in-law.

96
00:07:21,176 --> 00:07:22,396
I'll keep waiting.

97
00:07:23,335 --> 00:07:25,722
Waiting for the day when your true colors are exposed to everyone.

98
00:07:32,113 --> 00:07:33,333
Are you all right?

99
00:07:38,638 --> 00:07:39,682
Yao Yao.

100
00:07:40,787 --> 00:07:42,682
- Cheng Xi.   - How was it? Are you okay?

101
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:43,842
I'm fine.

102
00:07:44,305 --> 00:07:45,402
Congratulations.

103
00:07:45,775 --> 00:07:47,482
It's not time for congratulations yet.

104
00:07:48,095 --> 00:07:50,896
Deng Ming will probably push all the blame onto the litigant.

105
00:07:53,263 --> 00:07:54,464
Don't think too much about it.

106
00:07:54,576 --> 00:07:56,042
The most important thing is you won the case.

107
00:07:59,455 --> 00:08:00,522
Oh, by the way.

108
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,200
I'm sorry about earlier.

109
00:08:02,577 --> 00:08:04,133
I was afraid Deng Ming would see through it.

110
00:08:04,214 --> 00:08:05,722
So I didn't tell you in advance.

111
00:08:06,056 --> 00:08:07,482
You don't have to apologize to me.

112
00:08:07,576 --> 00:08:10,415
Lawyer Cheng, I should be the one thanking you.

113
00:08:11,056 --> 00:08:12,615
Thank you for not giving up on me.

114
00:08:13,936 --> 00:08:15,879
- Thank you for saving my child.   - Ms. Lin.

115
00:08:16,241 --> 00:08:17,762
Please don't say that.

116
00:08:18,256 --> 00:08:19,762
These are all things I should do.

117
00:08:20,702 --> 00:08:23,202
Since I took your case, I am responsible for you.

118
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:24,895
And we only have the evidence.

119
00:08:24,998 --> 00:08:26,398
We still have to see the final result.

120
00:08:27,727 --> 00:08:30,242
As I always say, we must trust the law.

121
00:08:30,496 --> 00:08:32,842
The law will protect the basic rights of every citizen.

122
00:08:35,695 --> 00:08:37,122
Lawyer Wu and Cheng Xi,

123
00:08:37,436 --> 00:08:39,762
I still have to prepare for the second trial and submit some materials.

124
00:08:39,881 --> 00:08:41,562
Can you help me send Ms. Lin back?

125
00:08:41,776 --> 00:08:43,362
Don't worry. You go do your work.

126
00:08:45,016 --> 00:08:46,442
Go back and rest early.

127
00:08:46,838 --> 00:08:47,962
Let's go.

128
00:08:48,775 --> 00:08:49,922
Thank you.

129
00:09:01,496 --> 00:09:02,996
Thank you, Lawyer Cheng and Lawyer Wu.

130
00:09:03,077 --> 00:09:04,095
- Slow down.   - Goodbye.

131
00:09:04,175 --> 00:09:05,202
Bye.

132
00:09:13,216 --> 00:09:15,282
- Are you upset?   - No.

133
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,120
You've never given me a dirty look like this before.

134
00:09:21,201 --> 00:09:23,482
I'm not showing you a dirty look now either.

135
00:09:27,072 --> 00:09:29,282
I just can't stand that Deng Ming.

136
00:09:30,256 --> 00:09:32,122
And I'm standing up for you.

137
00:09:32,584 --> 00:09:34,105
He used to slander you.

138
00:09:34,186 --> 00:09:35,746
How can you forgive him?

139
00:09:38,414 --> 00:09:41,162
I let him go before not because I'm soft-hearted.

140
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:45,296
I just wanted him to disappear from my life quickly.

141
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,442
Let's not talk about him, okay?

142
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,400
I just want to be with you.

143
00:09:59,415 --> 00:10:00,816
What did you say that person's name was?

144
00:10:02,807 --> 00:10:04,027
Deng Ming.

145
00:10:04,736 --> 00:10:07,095
Don't mention that unlucky name again.

146
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:11,785
And tell Cheng Yao not to call anyone else her brother-in-law.

147
00:10:11,866 --> 00:10:12,920
Her brother-in-law can only be me.

148
00:10:13,001 --> 00:10:14,281
Otherwise, I'll deduct her salary.

149
00:10:15,206 --> 00:10:16,256
I know.

150
00:10:16,336 --> 00:10:17,855
Don't be petty. Let's go.

151
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,560
Why are you back?

152
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,620
Have you finished your work?

153
00:10:37,382 --> 00:10:38,942
I handed my work over to Bao Rui.

154
00:10:40,504 --> 00:10:42,602
Yao Yao, don't be sad.

155
00:10:42,687 --> 00:10:44,048
It's just losing a case. It's okay.

156
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,082
You don't have to be strong in front of me.

157
00:10:48,257 --> 00:10:49,562
If you want to cry, just cry.

158
00:10:49,695 --> 00:10:50,915
I'll be here with you.

159
00:10:54,576 --> 00:10:56,516
I didn't expect to lose so badly.

160
00:10:57,376 --> 00:10:58,935
I'm sorry for disappointing you.

161
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,882
It's really okay. There's no winning without losing, right?

162
00:11:02,319 --> 00:11:03,319
I...

163
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,620
A moment, please.

164
00:11:07,193 --> 00:11:08,322
Hello.

165
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,722
Okay, I'll come over now.

166
00:11:11,752 --> 00:11:13,122
Do you have work to do?

167
00:11:13,327 --> 00:11:14,562
You can go. You don't have to accompany me.

168
00:11:14,678 --> 00:11:16,282
No, we got a table at the restaurant.

169
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,620
Let's go. Get in the car.

170
00:11:40,257 --> 00:11:42,256
Yao Yao, do you want to know

171
00:11:42,352 --> 00:11:44,932
what I learned from working on this joint case?

172
00:11:45,655 --> 00:11:47,176
What did you learn?

173
00:11:48,856 --> 00:11:50,245
The litigant in this case

174
00:11:50,326 --> 00:11:52,576
has a lover who has been with him for over 10 years.

175
00:11:53,164 --> 00:11:54,844
And I just found out recently

176
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,840
that his wife also has a lover.

177
00:12:00,747 --> 00:12:02,602
Isn't this a common thing?

178
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,575
The lover of his wife

179
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,776
is the younger brother of her husband's lover.

180
00:12:07,886 --> 00:12:09,106
Impressive, right?

181
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,940
It's so messy.

182
00:12:23,616 --> 00:12:24,836
I have another case.

183
00:12:25,616 --> 00:12:26,815
This case is like this:

184
00:12:26,895 --> 00:12:28,522
A couple from a blended family

185
00:12:28,695 --> 00:12:31,621
each have children from their previous relationships.

186
00:12:31,702 --> 00:12:33,191
And their children secretly fell in love.

187
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,722
The most impressive thing is that these parents

188
00:12:35,904 --> 00:12:38,522
decided to divorce for the sake of their two children.

189
00:12:38,694 --> 00:12:41,042
But in the end, when they were about to get divorced,

190
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:42,725
the daughter of the woman found out

191
00:12:42,806 --> 00:12:44,482
that the son of the man was cheating.

192
00:12:45,725 --> 00:12:48,282
- So, have they still got divorced?   - They have to.

193
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:50,918
Because the person the son cheated with

194
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:52,535
is the woman's longtime best friend.

195
00:12:52,631 --> 00:12:54,202
She is over 20 years older than him.

196
00:12:55,463 --> 00:12:57,562
I know you're making up stories to trick me.

197
00:12:58,432 --> 00:13:00,762
Lin Feng Juan's case hasn't ended yet.

198
00:13:01,088 --> 00:13:02,369
I'm confident about the second trial.

199
00:13:05,895 --> 00:13:07,416
I intentionally lost in the first trial.

200
00:13:12,109 --> 00:13:13,909
So you don't need to comfort me at all.

201
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,320
Are you kidding me?

202
00:13:15,543 --> 00:13:18,202
Don't you need a stage since you have such a strong desire to perform?

203
00:13:18,488 --> 00:13:20,242
Yao Yao, if you dare to tease me again next time, I tell you...

204
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,242
What will you do?

205
00:13:22,545 --> 00:13:23,922
I...

206
00:13:30,513 --> 00:13:32,482
If I really can win this,

207
00:13:33,216 --> 00:13:36,362
will you give me a small reward?

208
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,380
What do you want?

209
00:13:43,057 --> 00:13:44,562
What do I want?

210
00:13:48,815 --> 00:13:49,962
Look.

211
00:13:51,151 --> 00:13:53,202
Other couples have couple rings,

212
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:54,635
I want one too.

213
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,090
Well...

214
00:13:59,432 --> 00:14:02,282
- Well...   - But I can't wear it at the law firm, right?

215
00:14:05,736 --> 00:14:06,956
How about this?

216
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:08,639
Couple necklaces.

217
00:14:08,743 --> 00:14:09,984
Can we have couple necklaces?

218
00:14:10,256 --> 00:14:11,962
It will be hidden in clothing and therefore invisible.

219
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:14,962
- I want it.   - Yao Yao.

220
00:14:15,049 --> 00:14:16,888
As a grown man, why would I wear a couple's necklace?

221
00:14:16,977 --> 00:14:19,362
Don't you think it's like a dog with a name tag?

222
00:14:22,046 --> 00:14:25,007
No. I'm not saying you're a dog.

223
00:14:25,096 --> 00:14:26,316
What I mean is,

224
00:14:26,456 --> 00:14:30,320
you don't know what material these couple's necklaces are made of.

225
00:14:30,401 --> 00:14:32,995
What if you wear it and get metal poisoning

226
00:14:33,076 --> 00:14:34,242
or have an allergic reaction?

227
00:14:34,326 --> 00:14:35,562
Let's get something else.

228
00:14:35,953 --> 00:14:37,242
How about cooking?

229
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,596
Can you cook?

230
00:14:38,992 --> 00:14:40,071
You can make porridge.

231
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:41,758
I used to cook for you all the time.

232
00:14:43,154 --> 00:14:45,202
Cooking...

233
00:14:46,768 --> 00:14:49,064
Fine. How can your hands cook?

234
00:14:49,145 --> 00:14:51,042
They're so delicate. Right?

235
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,480
Not really.

236
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,100
Then, how about singing?

237
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,759
Singing love songs is also very romantic.

238
00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:04,975
I...

239
00:15:05,055 --> 00:15:06,482
Lately, I don't know what's wrong with me.

240
00:15:06,563 --> 00:15:09,082
My throat is a little uncomfortable.

241
00:15:09,354 --> 00:15:11,922
Singing love songs is something that even kids can do.

242
00:15:12,007 --> 00:15:13,442
But I really can't do it.

243
00:15:17,336 --> 00:15:18,556
I thought of something.

244
00:15:19,549 --> 00:15:21,602
I thought of something that you will definitely like.

245
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,202
I'll recite legal codes for you.

246
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,122
What kind of law do you want to hear?

247
00:15:35,878 --> 00:15:38,056
Suddenly, I feel like helping my client win the lawsuit

248
00:15:38,136 --> 00:15:40,362
is my responsibility and doesn't need any reward.

249
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,701
Right?

250
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:43,995
Come on. Let's eat.

251
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:52,322
My throat is really

252
00:15:53,016 --> 00:15:54,322
a little uncomfortable today.

253
00:15:59,135 --> 00:16:02,534
Did you skip meals and sleep poorly just to come back early?

254
00:16:02,935 --> 00:16:04,136
Yeah.

255
00:16:04,216 --> 00:16:06,026
I didn't eat well or sleep well outside.

256
00:16:06,456 --> 00:16:08,095
Next time, don't fly back and forth.

257
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,395
It will break my heart.

258
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:11,042
Really heartbreaking?

259
00:16:11,488 --> 00:16:12,689
Well,

260
00:16:12,856 --> 00:16:14,376
can I ask for a reward from you?

261
00:16:14,479 --> 00:16:15,699
What kind of reward?

262
00:16:17,128 --> 00:16:18,448
Many times before,

263
00:16:18,575 --> 00:16:21,015
either I was interrupted by Bao Rui, or there was an accident.

264
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,880
This time, can we...

265
00:16:53,136 --> 00:16:54,482
We finally kissed.

266
00:17:40,256 --> 00:17:41,402
Coming.

267
00:17:49,095 --> 00:17:50,562
Hello, your takeout is here.

268
00:17:50,992 --> 00:17:52,162
Thank you.

269
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,940
You bought this?

270
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:21,013
Why did you suddenly buy flowers and champagne?

271
00:18:22,095 --> 00:18:24,322
To celebrate your first time appearing in court independently.

272
00:18:25,048 --> 00:18:26,162
And also...

273
00:18:26,696 --> 00:18:27,916
What else?

274
00:18:29,032 --> 00:18:30,682
And I'm happy for the reward you gave me.

275
00:18:38,336 --> 00:18:39,432
Why...

276
00:18:43,335 --> 00:18:45,442
Why is your stomach suddenly hurting?

277
00:18:46,432 --> 00:18:47,652
Let me take you to the hospital.

278
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,562
Come on.

279
00:18:57,683 --> 00:18:59,282
It's just acute gastroenteritis.

280
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,660
It's not too serious.

281
00:19:00,815 --> 00:19:03,522
After finishing this drip bag, just take some medicine.

282
00:19:03,722 --> 00:19:05,002
Try to rest more.

283
00:19:05,256 --> 00:19:08,268
Drink more electrolyte drinks to prevent dehydration.

284
00:19:08,674 --> 00:19:11,682
It's better to have a light diet this half month.

285
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:15,153
- Eat something liquid or semi-liquid.   - Okay.

286
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:17,722
Qian, if you need anything, come to me.

287
00:19:18,135 --> 00:19:19,355
Thank you, Dr. Liu.

288
00:19:26,654 --> 00:19:29,002
The doctor said it's nothing serious.

289
00:19:30,496 --> 00:19:32,735
But your health is not a small matter to me.

290
00:19:37,392 --> 00:19:39,202
You seem to know the doctor well.

291
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,100
Dr. Liu

292
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,719
is a specialist in gastroenterology.

293
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,282
When I had stomach problems before, I always went to him.

294
00:19:46,896 --> 00:19:49,151
If I had met you earlier, it would have been great.

295
00:19:49,335 --> 00:19:51,282
I would have helped you take care of your stomach.

296
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,060
It's not too late now.

297
00:19:54,144 --> 00:19:56,104
All right, go to sleep for a while.

298
00:19:56,216 --> 00:19:57,775
I'll call you when the IV is done.

299
00:19:58,216 --> 00:19:59,962
But I can't sleep now.

300
00:20:01,656 --> 00:20:03,055
How about you sing for me?

301
00:20:10,095 --> 00:20:11,315
Just kidding.

302
00:20:11,696 --> 00:20:12,975
I know you can't sing.

303
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:24,762
(Happy birthday to you.)

304
00:20:25,264 --> 00:20:28,984
(Happy birthday to you.)

305
00:20:29,575 --> 00:20:31,896
(Happy birthday)

306
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,775
(to you.)

307
00:20:35,016 --> 00:20:38,535
(Happy birthday to you.)

308
00:21:43,016 --> 00:21:44,562
I tried my best. I really did.

309
00:21:44,689 --> 00:21:45,882
Cheng Yao.

310
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,522
Why didn't you tell me that you're hospitalized?

311
00:21:49,862 --> 00:21:52,122
If Dr. Liu didn't call me,

312
00:21:52,272 --> 00:21:54,562
I wouldn't have known what was going on.

313
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:59,799
You! Did you take Cheng to eat all sorts of things?

314
00:22:00,088 --> 00:22:02,042
It's one thing if your own stomach is messed up,

315
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:03,656
but you're also causing trouble to...

316
00:22:03,736 --> 00:22:05,002
I'm sorry.

317
00:22:05,105 --> 00:22:06,122
Cheng Yao.

318
00:22:06,203 --> 00:22:07,402
Do you have any shame?

319
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:10,762
My dad has some shares in this private hospital.

320
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:13,630
So, Dr. Liu is like our family doctor.

321
00:22:15,058 --> 00:22:16,458
- Cheng Yao.   - Mrs. Qian.

322
00:22:16,578 --> 00:22:18,322
You're hospitalized.

323
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:21,762
How am I supposed to explain to my in-laws?

324
00:22:24,111 --> 00:22:27,082
Oh, yeah. What do you want to eat or drink?

325
00:22:27,236 --> 00:22:28,376
Tell me.

326
00:22:28,486 --> 00:22:30,535
I'll have someone to make for you right away.

327
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:33,242
No, I'll do it myself.

328
00:22:33,367 --> 00:22:34,767
Mom, please don't.

329
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:36,322
She can't handle it.

330
00:22:36,456 --> 00:22:38,812
No, what I mean is the doctor told her to eat liquid food.

331
00:22:38,893 --> 00:22:40,113
She...

332
00:22:40,688 --> 00:22:42,922
Do I still need you to tell or teach me?

333
00:22:42,982 --> 00:22:44,202
Don't I know?

334
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:47,815
Liquid food also has a different category, right?

335
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,160
Do you think everyone is like you?

336
00:22:50,271 --> 00:22:51,951
Eating three meals a day randomly.

337
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,282
What a mess.

338
00:22:54,614 --> 00:22:57,522
Did you get sick because you were taking care of him?

339
00:22:57,739 --> 00:22:58,847
No, Mrs. Qian.

340
00:22:58,928 --> 00:23:01,242
It's because I ate too much. Don't blame Qian Heng.

341
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:04,202
Why not blame him? It's all his fault. Just blame him.

342
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:05,736
You aren't serving your role as a boyfriend, are you?

343
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:07,235
Do you know how to take care of someone?

344
00:23:07,617 --> 00:23:08,837
It must be his fault.

345
00:23:10,575 --> 00:23:12,015
I asked Dr. Liu.

346
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:14,255
He said resting for two days would be enough.

347
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,050
Don't worry.

348
00:23:18,256 --> 00:23:19,376
Just rest well.

349
00:23:19,533 --> 00:23:20,695
I'm still worried.

350
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:22,442
I'm going to have a meeting with the doctor.

351
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:23,979
Mom, no...

352
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:30,682
Rest well.

353
00:23:41,624 --> 00:23:43,122
Don't stress out. She's like this.

354
00:23:43,295 --> 00:23:46,974
No, I just wonder how such a lovely mother

355
00:23:47,086 --> 00:23:49,162
gave birth to such a different son?

356
00:23:51,037 --> 00:23:53,335
When I was young, I had the same question.

357
00:23:53,417 --> 00:23:56,057
So I took my mom's hair to do a paternity test.

358
00:23:56,271 --> 00:23:57,293
And then?

359
00:23:57,374 --> 00:23:58,594
And then,

360
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:01,303
I was scolded and beaten by my parents.

361
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,360
What's wrong?

362
00:24:57,535 --> 00:24:59,376
There's too little water.

363
00:24:59,544 --> 00:25:01,385
It's going to turn into rice.

364
00:25:01,688 --> 00:25:02,936
Why did you get up?

365
00:25:03,016 --> 00:25:04,495
Go back to bed. Go.

366
00:25:04,575 --> 00:25:05,735
There's really too little water.

367
00:25:05,815 --> 00:25:07,035
Okay, I know.

368
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,140
Water.

369
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,220
It's ready.

370
00:25:26,707 --> 00:25:27,927
Let me do it.

371
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,680
Be careful. It's hot.

372
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,701
- Is it too hot?   - It's sweet.

373
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:43,416
Since you're sick, your mouth can't really taste anything.

374
00:25:43,511 --> 00:25:45,510
So I added sugar and red dates for you.

375
00:25:46,335 --> 00:25:47,555
Take another sip.

376
00:25:53,016 --> 00:25:54,236
Is it good?

377
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,762
Take another sip.

378
00:26:13,216 --> 00:26:15,696
I never thought being in a relationship would be so sweet.

379
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:19,242
I think you're confused because of your illness.

380
00:26:21,511 --> 00:26:23,271
I used to think those storylines

381
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:25,936
where the man is strong and the woman is weak were outdated.

382
00:26:26,736 --> 00:26:29,642
But I never thought after getting sick,

383
00:26:29,723 --> 00:26:32,335
being taken care of would actually make me feel quite happy.

384
00:26:36,176 --> 00:26:37,396
You're blushing.

385
00:26:37,657 --> 00:26:39,256
No way.

386
00:26:40,775 --> 00:26:42,813
From now on, I'll treat you even better.

387
00:26:43,456 --> 00:26:44,676
Okay.

388
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,980
Who is it?

389
00:26:57,137 --> 00:26:58,442
Seafood porridge,

390
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:00,242
stewed fish maw soup,

391
00:27:00,985 --> 00:27:02,185
sliced fish,

392
00:27:02,266 --> 00:27:04,147
stewed baby bok choy with dried scallops.

393
00:27:04,446 --> 00:27:06,415
I made all of these especially for you.

394
00:27:06,496 --> 00:27:07,716
I made them myself.

395
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,920
Thank you, Mrs. Qian.

396
00:27:09,016 --> 00:27:10,202
Come and try it.

397
00:27:10,283 --> 00:27:12,009
See if it suits your taste.

398
00:27:13,976 --> 00:27:15,576
But I just ate.

399
00:27:15,656 --> 00:27:17,896
I can't eat anymore now.

400
00:27:19,011 --> 00:27:20,034
You already ate?

401
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:22,042
Yeah, Mom. I made it for her.

402
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:23,879
You made it?

403
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:27,522
I have to go check.

404
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,479
This is called porridge?

405
00:27:34,271 --> 00:27:36,072
There are just two red dates.

406
00:27:36,397 --> 00:27:37,962
So stingy.

407
00:27:38,263 --> 00:27:40,907
Qian Heng, are you living up to your surname?

408
00:27:41,017 --> 00:27:44,202
- I...   - We are running low on red dates.

409
00:27:44,711 --> 00:27:46,282
Don't bother explaining for him.

410
00:27:46,527 --> 00:27:49,322
Let me tell you. The men in the Qian family are like this.

411
00:27:49,485 --> 00:27:51,495
Give them an inch and they'll take a mile.

412
00:27:51,655 --> 00:27:53,054
You can't be soft-hearted.

413
00:27:53,243 --> 00:27:55,922
Otherwise, they'll easily take advantage of you.

414
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,220
Understand?

415
00:27:58,001 --> 00:27:59,009
Okay, Mom.

416
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:01,248
It's almost time. You should go back.

417
00:28:01,736 --> 00:28:02,956
I'm fine.

418
00:28:03,397 --> 00:28:04,557
I have plenty of time.

419
00:28:04,684 --> 00:28:05,965
I want to take care of Cheng Yao.

420
00:28:06,048 --> 00:28:07,522
Yes, you have nothing to do.

421
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,820
She needs to rest.

422
00:28:10,216 --> 00:28:11,336
That's right.

423
00:28:11,416 --> 00:28:13,136
Right, you need to rest too.

424
00:28:13,286 --> 00:28:15,206
Okay, I'll leave first.

425
00:28:15,615 --> 00:28:18,082
Remember to heat it up when you want to eat.

426
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:20,782
If it's too salty or too bland, just tell me.

427
00:28:20,863 --> 00:28:22,162
Enough, Mom. You should go back now.

428
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:23,564
- Okay.   - Go accompany Dad.

429
00:28:23,696 --> 00:28:26,947
- Hurry up.   - Don't rush me. I'm putting on my shoes.

430
00:28:27,028 --> 00:28:28,069
I know.

431
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,160
- Cheng Yao.   - Okay.

432
00:28:29,257 --> 00:28:31,077
- I'll wait for your call anytime.   - Okay.

433
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,960
Okay, Mom, hurry back. Be careful on the road.

434
00:28:33,055 --> 00:28:34,215
- Take care of yourself.   - Go.

435
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:36,096
- Take good care of her.   - I know.

436
00:28:36,183 --> 00:28:37,242
Goodbye.

437
00:28:37,575 --> 00:28:39,495
Why are you in such a hurry to send her away?

438
00:28:42,736 --> 00:28:43,956
What do you think?

439
00:28:46,428 --> 00:28:47,668
I'm going to rest in my room.

440
00:29:00,337 --> 00:29:02,442
Why are you running so fast?

441
00:29:02,652 --> 00:29:03,872
What are you thinking about?

442
00:29:06,367 --> 00:29:09,368
I'm just thinking about something you're thinking about.

443
00:29:10,775 --> 00:29:11,936
Is that so?

444
00:29:12,047 --> 00:29:14,526
I just want to work here.

445
00:29:18,896 --> 00:29:20,242
That's exactly what I was thinking.

446
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:21,678
What a coincidence.

447
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,640
Then, I'll just work here.

448
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:27,615
Just remember not to peek at me.

449
00:29:27,756 --> 00:29:29,322
Work seriously.

450
00:29:29,845 --> 00:29:31,684
Who's peeking at who is still uncertain.

451
00:29:32,532 --> 00:29:34,002
You also have to remember.

452
00:29:34,661 --> 00:29:35,881
Don't sneak a glance at me.

453
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:47,140
(This is my boyfriend's first time making breakfast for me.)

454
00:32:47,221 --> 00:32:48,991
(I can't discourage his enthusiasm.)

455
00:32:49,155 --> 00:32:51,122
(I must pretend I didn't see anything.)

456
00:32:51,232 --> 00:32:52,472
(No matter how it turns out,)

457
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:54,473
(I have to praise him and encourage him.)

458
00:32:58,416 --> 00:32:59,442
Good morning.

459
00:33:00,022 --> 00:33:02,167
- You are awake.   - So many dishes?

460
00:33:02,575 --> 00:33:03,795
How's your stomach feeling?

461
00:33:03,974 --> 00:33:05,194
Much better.

462
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:07,440
You came just in time.

463
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:11,570
Quick. Try it while it's hot.

464
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,508
What is this?

465
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,840
Spinach noodles. I made it myself.

466
00:33:14,921 --> 00:33:16,760
Why do they look like caterpillars?

467
00:33:17,485 --> 00:33:19,845
Is it? Try it while it's hot.

468
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,239
These pan-fried dumplings look good.

469
00:33:48,071 --> 00:33:49,442
Crispy skin and lots of filling.

470
00:33:50,216 --> 00:33:53,042
- Delicious.   - This is the takeout that I ordered.

471
00:33:53,661 --> 00:33:55,008
You try this.

472
00:33:55,103 --> 00:33:57,183
I made it myself. Eat it while it's hot.

473
00:33:57,295 --> 00:33:58,962
Otherwise, it will get cold, and it won't be as tasty later.

474
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:01,642
Try it.

475
00:34:09,735 --> 00:34:11,362
This is also really delicious.

476
00:34:12,301 --> 00:34:14,159
Yao Yao, everything on the table, except for this one,

477
00:34:14,254 --> 00:34:15,602
is takeout that I ordered.

478
00:34:15,744 --> 00:34:17,687
Really, you try it. I've been practicing and made it.

479
00:34:17,783 --> 00:34:19,344
I don't think there should be any problems.

480
00:34:20,896 --> 00:34:22,922
Hurry up and try it while it's hot.

481
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:39,755
Try it.

482
00:34:48,175 --> 00:34:50,216
(Praise. Encourage.)

483
00:35:00,456 --> 00:35:02,362
Delicious.

484
00:35:03,416 --> 00:35:05,095
- Then...   - I'll be late for work.

485
00:35:05,217 --> 00:35:06,522
I'll go to work first.

486
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,762
In such a hurry?

487
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,552
You're not lucky today.

488
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:33,950
Senior Wu Jun.

489
00:35:34,268 --> 00:35:35,375
Yi Ran.

490
00:35:35,456 --> 00:35:37,496
What a coincidence to meet you here.

491
00:35:38,456 --> 00:35:39,676
Not really.

492
00:35:40,896 --> 00:35:42,376
I heard your case is over.

493
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,722
I came here specifically to find you.

494
00:35:44,002 --> 00:35:45,655
Senior, you're such a busy person.

495
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,711
You wouldn't come to see me for no reason, right?

496
00:35:49,776 --> 00:35:51,221
I'm here to undercut.

497
00:35:52,711 --> 00:35:54,016
Are you interested in Junheng & Co?

498
00:35:54,305 --> 00:35:55,305
When you put it like that,

499
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:56,842
do you think I would dare to say I'm not interested?

500
00:35:57,024 --> 00:36:01,696
Well, Junheng & Co is in need of a female partner in the family law field.

501
00:36:01,886 --> 00:36:03,106
After thinking it over,

502
00:36:03,416 --> 00:36:04,636
I think you're suitable.

503
00:36:05,416 --> 00:36:08,056
I've been doing well at my current law firm.

504
00:36:08,253 --> 00:36:12,374
I've always admired Junheng & Co, the leading firm in the family field.

505
00:36:12,477 --> 00:36:14,188
It's an honor to work with you.

506
00:36:14,269 --> 00:36:15,271
However,

507
00:36:15,557 --> 00:36:18,984
did you get Qian Heng's permission to offer me a position?

508
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,015
I know he always has high demands.

509
00:36:21,164 --> 00:36:22,336
For me to come and invite you,

510
00:36:22,416 --> 00:36:24,495
it must have been discussed between me and Qian Heng.

511
00:36:24,575 --> 00:36:27,122
And he highly recognizes your professional abilities.

512
00:36:29,416 --> 00:36:30,655
Changing jobs is not a small matter.

513
00:36:30,735 --> 00:36:33,095
I can't make a decision in a short time.

514
00:36:33,175 --> 00:36:35,175
So, please give me more time to consider.

515
00:36:35,255 --> 00:36:37,482
There's no rush. I'll wait for your good news anytime.

516
00:36:37,799 --> 00:36:38,842
Okay.

517
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,939
You just received the pennant. Are you excited?

518
00:36:44,615 --> 00:36:46,975
I really didn't expect Lin Feng Juan to send me a pennant.

519
00:36:47,094 --> 00:36:49,367
You put so much effort into her case

520
00:36:49,453 --> 00:36:51,042
and even raised funds for her child at the firm.

521
00:36:51,123 --> 00:36:52,683
This pennant is well-deserved for you.

522
00:36:54,336 --> 00:36:56,416
Cheng Yao, this is a small step for you,

523
00:36:56,496 --> 00:36:58,682
but it's a big step for our Glory and Wealth group.

524
00:36:58,809 --> 00:37:01,249
Therefore, please allow me, on behalf of the boss,

525
00:37:01,461 --> 00:37:03,724
to thank you for everything you've done for Junheng

526
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:05,535
in securing the Golden Scale Award.

527
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:06,930
A thousand or ten thousand expressions of gratitude

528
00:37:07,011 --> 00:37:09,242
are not as meaningful as holding a pennant yourself.

529
00:37:09,337 --> 00:37:11,122
Right, Bao Rui?

530
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,322
This joke is very Bao Rui.

531
00:37:16,095 --> 00:37:18,634
All right, everyone, for today's meeting,

532
00:37:18,727 --> 00:37:20,376
I want to give special recognition to Cheng Yao.

533
00:37:20,532 --> 00:37:22,776
Since she joined the law firm, she has made great progress.

534
00:37:22,856 --> 00:37:24,376
Today, she also received her first pennant.

535
00:37:24,479 --> 00:37:25,699
Congratulations, Cheng Yao.

536
00:37:35,028 --> 00:37:36,127
All right.

537
00:37:36,215 --> 00:37:38,217
All the cases have been sent to the firm partners' emails

538
00:37:38,312 --> 00:37:39,962
and will be distributed by the firm partners themselves.

539
00:37:40,984 --> 00:37:42,185
Cheng Yao,

540
00:37:42,336 --> 00:37:43,762
due to your outstanding performance before,

541
00:37:43,843 --> 00:37:47,002
you will handle the Taicheng Group's family trust dispute.

542
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,482
Okay.

543
00:37:49,615 --> 00:37:50,835
Let's get started.

544
00:38:09,623 --> 00:38:11,624
All right, that's all for today.

545
00:38:12,453 --> 00:38:14,482
The retreat is coming up. I hope everyone has fun.

546
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:15,882
Dismiss.

547
00:38:19,456 --> 00:38:20,522
Cheng Yao.

548
00:38:20,687 --> 00:38:22,561
Don't forget your roots when you become successful.

549
00:38:22,936 --> 00:38:24,742
Cheng Yao, it's the first time I've heard our boss

550
00:38:24,823 --> 00:38:26,354
praise someone so much in a meeting.

551
00:38:26,456 --> 00:38:28,202
- Impressive.   - Really.

552
00:38:29,696 --> 00:38:31,882
Our boss must value you a lot.

553
00:38:32,093 --> 00:38:33,614
On the other hand,

554
00:38:33,754 --> 00:38:35,482
the person he loves the most should still be me.

555
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:39,216
Why did he choose to have our retreat in the country this time?

556
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,802
- Why?   - Because he knows I'm tired of going abroad.

557
00:38:43,376 --> 00:38:45,055
He is so attentive.

558
00:38:45,176 --> 00:38:47,177
I'm the apple of his eye.

559
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:50,015
If you put it that way, his heart must be a durian.

560
00:38:50,126 --> 00:38:52,122
- What do you mean?   - It's very sharp.

561
00:38:54,616 --> 00:38:57,042
Yu Fei, it will pierce you to death, all right? It'll pierce you to death.

562
00:39:08,816 --> 00:39:11,495
I've been so busy lately because of my child

563
00:39:11,575 --> 00:39:13,976
that I haven't had a chance to properly thank you.

564
00:39:14,228 --> 00:39:15,935
Even though we're already so close,

565
00:39:16,078 --> 00:39:21,917
I still want to thank you for keeping my house.

566
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,100
Hello?

567
00:39:29,535 --> 00:39:30,755
What's wrong?

568
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,122
What's up?

569
00:39:33,834 --> 00:39:36,754
Well, I heard from someone I know

570
00:39:36,912 --> 00:39:38,535
that Zhang Hao and Liang Qiong Qiong

571
00:39:38,615 --> 00:39:41,175
were so confident to get the house before.

572
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:44,015
But now, things took an unexpected turn.

573
00:39:44,141 --> 00:39:46,441
The two often argued because of this matter.

574
00:39:46,535 --> 00:39:49,696
And Liang Qiong Qiong's parents even went to trouble Zhang Hao,

575
00:39:49,809 --> 00:39:52,848
saying he cheated on his marriage and asking for compensation.

576
00:39:58,957 --> 00:40:00,277
Miss Cheng Yao,

577
00:40:00,453 --> 00:40:02,492
are you even listening to me?

578
00:40:03,695 --> 00:40:07,455
Ting Ting. I want to do a spa treatment for my whole body right now.

579
00:40:07,535 --> 00:40:08,755
Spa?

580
00:40:08,984 --> 00:40:11,423
Cheng Yao, you're acting strange.

581
00:40:11,816 --> 00:40:15,402
I've never seen you so concerned about skincare and beauty.

582
00:40:15,575 --> 00:40:17,416
Tell. Is it because of Qian Heng?

583
00:40:17,496 --> 00:40:18,522
No.

584
00:40:18,603 --> 00:40:21,084
It's because we're going on a trip in a few days. So I was thinking...

585
00:40:21,216 --> 00:40:23,311
Oh my god. You're good.

586
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,086
You finally figured it out.

587
00:40:25,254 --> 00:40:27,402
It's our company retreat. There are a lot of people.

588
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,575
What's the difference?

589
00:40:29,686 --> 00:40:31,736
Anyway, he's your boss.

590
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:33,735
If he wants to create a romantic atmosphere,

591
00:40:33,894 --> 00:40:35,522
it's an easy task.

592
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:37,455
You're right to do a spa treatment.

593
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,042
It's your first time after all. You have to leave a good impression.

594
00:40:40,217 --> 00:40:44,131
But I didn't expect that you two have been living together

595
00:40:44,212 --> 00:40:45,682
for such a long time

596
00:40:45,841 --> 00:40:47,522
and nothing has happened.

597
00:40:47,744 --> 00:40:49,482
That's too innocent.

598
00:40:53,134 --> 00:40:55,922
That's because we're both busy and don't have time.

599
00:40:56,003 --> 00:40:57,362
What nonsense are you talking?

600
00:40:58,005 --> 00:40:59,751
Haven't you heard the saying

601
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:02,162
that time is like water in a sponge?

602
00:41:02,257 --> 00:41:04,056
Squeeze it and it will come.

603
00:41:04,287 --> 00:41:06,095
You still have to make an effort.

604
00:41:06,175 --> 00:41:07,615
You not only need to have the desire,

605
00:41:07,695 --> 00:41:08,935
but also the courage.

606
00:41:09,742 --> 00:41:11,202
Don't talk nonsense.

607
00:41:11,976 --> 00:41:14,096
I'm only speaking the truth.

608
00:41:14,575 --> 00:41:18,067
Anyway, travel is the best way to increase the bond.

609
00:41:18,569 --> 00:41:22,809
In such a beautiful place, with the sunset as the backdrop,

610
00:41:22,936 --> 00:41:25,138
the atmosphere immediately becomes romantic.

611
00:41:25,256 --> 00:41:28,574
Then, get some sweet and delicious alcohol.

612
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:30,122
When the two of you look at each other...

613
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:32,522
Hello.

614
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,959
Go shopping in the supermarket now?

615
00:41:35,189 --> 00:41:36,710
I'm with Meng Ting.

616
00:41:37,321 --> 00:41:38,633
I'll leave soon.

617
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,879
I won't disturb you two.

618
00:41:42,696 --> 00:41:44,876
Where can you find such a good bestie like me?

619
00:41:45,335 --> 00:41:46,555
Enjoy yourselves.

620
00:41:48,695 --> 00:41:49,915
See you later.

621
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,940
Let's buy some face masks.

622
00:41:58,175 --> 00:41:59,536
We don't need face masks.

623
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,646
Then, let's get some sunscreen.

624
00:42:02,369 --> 00:42:03,442
Okay.

625
00:42:04,896 --> 00:42:06,295
And a facial mist.

626
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,521
That way, we can touch up anytime.

627
00:42:11,655 --> 00:42:14,135
Let's also get some toiletries. Portable ones.

628
00:42:14,215 --> 00:42:15,305
Sure.

629
00:42:27,215 --> 00:42:30,335
If you're indecisive, why don't we get one of each?

630
00:42:31,496 --> 00:42:34,536
We won't be able to use them all.

631
00:42:36,976 --> 00:42:39,256
Right. Then, take one.

632
00:42:41,776 --> 00:42:42,996
This will do.

633
00:42:47,296 --> 00:42:48,735
Let's get some snacks.
