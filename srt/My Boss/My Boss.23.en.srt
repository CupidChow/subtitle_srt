1
00:01:35,626 --> 00:01:39,002
(My Boss)

2
00:01:39,907 --> 00:01:41,896
(Episode 23)

3
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:44,670
(Qian Heng, you're under probation.)

4
00:01:44,751 --> 00:01:47,088
(I'll put you under love probation for one month.)

5
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:58,003
Don't you have anything to tell me?

6
00:02:03,216 --> 00:02:04,362
But I do.

7
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,100
How have you been considering the matter of my confession?

8
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,652
I was single for 30 years. I have no bad habits.

9
00:02:20,733 --> 00:02:22,476
I have a Master's Degree, a stable job,

10
00:02:22,557 --> 00:02:23,631
the Five Insurances and housing fund.

11
00:02:23,655 --> 00:02:25,233
I have a car, a house, and permanent assets.

12
00:02:25,257 --> 00:02:26,798
I know how to swim. My mother knows how to swim too.

13
00:02:26,822 --> 00:02:29,420
I'll definitely save you first if you and my mother fall into the river.

14
00:02:29,444 --> 00:02:31,293
Why are you saying that all of a sudden?

15
00:02:31,374 --> 00:02:33,407
I'll make you the second happiest person in the world.

16
00:02:33,431 --> 00:02:36,151
It's because I'm the happiest person in the world when I'm with you.

17
00:02:36,183 --> 00:02:37,403
The world...

18
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,010
The world...

19
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,980
The world is complete with you.

20
00:02:44,213 --> 00:02:46,044
My life is beautiful because of you.

21
00:02:46,151 --> 00:02:47,820
- With you... - Boss, your pick up lines are so outdated

22
00:02:47,844 --> 00:02:49,326
that my parents wouldn't even use them.

23
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,111
You should've been more professional if you intend to copy something.

24
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,290
How did you know I copied them?

25
00:03:05,671 --> 00:03:06,891
You...

26
00:03:08,808 --> 00:03:10,118
Do you truly like me?

27
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,741
(I'm so happy today.)

28
00:03:19,948 --> 00:03:21,024
(I'm so happy today.)

29
00:03:21,105 --> 00:03:22,928
(I'm so happy today.)

30
00:03:26,638 --> 00:03:28,039
(Today, today.)

31
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,522
(Today...)

32
00:03:29,671 --> 00:03:31,722
Boss, why are you still here?

33
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:35,127
I came back to take some documents after meeting my client.

34
00:03:35,151 --> 00:03:36,282
Why are you here?

35
00:03:36,454 --> 00:03:38,963
What a coincidence. I forgot to take my case files.

36
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:41,531
Great timing. I have a case to discuss with you.

37
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,430
I need to rest now. We can talk tomorrow.

38
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,322
- You're resting already? - That's right.

39
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,155
Boss, you never refused a case discussion with me

40
00:03:52,179 --> 00:03:53,501
just because you needed to rest.

41
00:03:54,253 --> 00:03:56,394
Did I do anything wrong lately?

42
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,621
No. You did a great job lately.

43
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,500
Go back now.

44
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,211
I'll make a move, then.

45
00:04:05,423 --> 00:04:06,643
What's wrong again?

46
00:04:07,551 --> 00:04:09,202
I thought Cheng Yao was here just now.

47
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,690
She left?

48
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,802
I saw her going downstairs just now.

49
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,762
- I'll make a move first, then. - Okay.

50
00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:20,499
What exactly do you want?

51
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,962
I haven't taken my case files yet.

52
00:04:24,627 --> 00:04:26,082
I came here to take them.

53
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,971
- Boss, I haven't taken the case files yet. - Just leave.

54
00:04:38,725 --> 00:04:40,750
(You don't look happy today.)

55
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,802
(You don't look happy today.)

56
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:57,322
You don't need to hide.

57
00:04:57,529 --> 00:04:58,799
Come out now.

58
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,362
Your legs must be numb.

59
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,362
You should exercise more in the future.

60
00:05:42,805 --> 00:05:44,608
Boss, I'm going home now.

61
00:07:09,751 --> 00:07:11,162
Calm down.

62
00:07:11,326 --> 00:07:12,802
Don't let your imagination run wild.

63
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:37,910
Cheng Yao.

64
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,962
- Morning, Bao. - Morning.

65
00:07:51,751 --> 00:07:53,282
Bao, did you catch a cold?

66
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,962
I feel light-headed.

67
00:07:57,471 --> 00:07:59,002
My nose is stuck too.

68
00:07:59,736 --> 00:08:00,820
You had no idea.

69
00:08:00,901 --> 00:08:03,670
Boss called me at 6am just now.

70
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:06,042
He told me to attend an important PR meeting.

71
00:08:06,591 --> 00:08:08,581
Lawyer Wu called me too.

72
00:08:09,511 --> 00:08:11,781
He told me to make an important disclaimer.

73
00:08:12,231 --> 00:08:14,202
I knew our boss needed me long ago.

74
00:08:14,631 --> 00:08:16,002
I didn't expect Lawyer Wu

75
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:17,802
to need me this badly too.

76
00:08:20,065 --> 00:08:22,642
What disclaimer? Is it related to Junheng & Co?

77
00:08:22,951 --> 00:08:24,261
Cheng Yao.

78
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,242
Look.

79
00:08:26,557 --> 00:08:27,970
Bai Xing Ming announced that she was pregnant.

80
00:08:27,994 --> 00:08:30,314
She even mentioned the name of a person called Richard Li.

81
00:08:32,271 --> 00:08:33,990
Our website has great timing.

82
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,473
We chose to make a disclaimer at this period,

83
00:08:35,497 --> 00:08:37,430
saying that we sued Bai Xing Meng

84
00:08:37,514 --> 00:08:40,395
for maligning us and winning the lawsuit.

85
00:08:40,476 --> 00:08:42,882
Those who scolded you have apologized to you.

86
00:08:43,391 --> 00:08:46,701
Bai Xing Meng received a tight slap in the face.

87
00:08:48,231 --> 00:08:50,331
Bao, were you dealing with this case this morning?

88
00:08:52,218 --> 00:08:54,301
To be honest,

89
00:08:54,391 --> 00:08:57,290
our boss was the one who drafted the disclaimer.

90
00:08:57,631 --> 00:08:59,042
But I have something to say.

91
00:08:59,242 --> 00:09:02,701
I'm indeed talented when it comes to doing PR.

92
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:05,331
I'm done for.

93
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:07,864
Lawyer Wu saw my potential.

94
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:09,962
He's going to steal me from our boss.

95
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,562
Who should I choose?

96
00:09:11,816 --> 00:09:13,202
Suit yourself.

97
00:09:14,365 --> 00:09:16,371
Anyway, Bai Xing Meng was unlucky

98
00:09:16,452 --> 00:09:18,082
that she went against Lawyer Qian.

99
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,994
Lawyer Qian remained dormant for a long time

100
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,230
just for this day to arrive.

101
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,590
He has avenged you too.

102
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,890
This is so satisfying.

103
00:09:25,954 --> 00:09:27,174
Who should I choose?

104
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,230
I think I have to reject Lawyer Wu.

105
00:09:33,992 --> 00:09:35,162
(I confessed to her before this, )

106
00:09:35,186 --> 00:09:36,456
(but it was pretty hasty.)

107
00:09:36,698 --> 00:09:38,431
(Now, I'm courting her again.)

108
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,191
(Do you guys have any suggestions?)

109
00:09:40,499 --> 00:09:42,020
(I might not take them.)

110
00:09:47,111 --> 00:09:50,042
(When you court someone, sincerity is the only important factor.)

111
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:52,093
(You can get a girlfriend)

112
00:09:52,222 --> 00:09:54,222
(as long as you can make her feel your sincerity.)

113
00:10:09,282 --> 00:10:11,323
(Disclaimer: Junheng & Co filed a lawsuit against Miss Bai Xing Meng)

114
00:10:11,347 --> 00:10:12,787
(for her false accusations and won.)

115
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:42,082
(Thank you for helping me.)

116
00:10:56,565 --> 00:10:58,402
- Hello. - (Come to my office.)

117
00:11:03,728 --> 00:11:06,482
(Oh no. Although I'm grateful to him, )

118
00:11:06,637 --> 00:11:08,986
(I'm not ready to face him yet.)

119
00:11:14,503 --> 00:11:15,602
Come in.

120
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,067
Boss, were you looking for me?

121
00:11:24,672 --> 00:11:26,750
This is the client's profile. Take a look.

122
00:11:26,892 --> 00:11:29,072
Try to revise the draft of the prenuptial agreement.

123
00:11:29,294 --> 00:11:30,514
Okay.

124
00:11:33,922 --> 00:11:35,322
(Li Ming)

125
00:11:37,424 --> 00:11:39,282
Isn't this the person Bai Xing Meng tagged?

126
00:11:40,439 --> 00:11:42,119
He's the actual controller of Kankan Novel

127
00:11:42,239 --> 00:11:44,350
and the biggest competitor of Tuantuan Online.

128
00:11:47,631 --> 00:11:50,374
So, Bai Xing Meng treated Xu Jun in that manner because of this guy?

129
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:55,435
Did she announce her pregnancy in public

130
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,650
because of her prenuptial agreement with Li Ming?

131
00:11:57,818 --> 00:11:58,922
That's right.

132
00:11:59,003 --> 00:12:00,605
But it isn't the prenuptial agreement with Bai Xing Meng.

133
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:02,322
Richard intends to marry

134
00:12:02,451 --> 00:12:03,870
the daughter of a media tycoon.

135
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,934
It's considered a marriage alliance between two equal families.

136
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,358
He never intended to marry Bai Xing Meng in the first place.

137
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,230
Bai Xing Meng wants to be his wife by announcing her pregnancy.

138
00:12:10,254 --> 00:12:12,185
But Richard never took her seriously.

139
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:17,682
So, Bai Xing Ming risked everything and announced her pregnancy

140
00:12:18,111 --> 00:12:19,980
to mess up Li Ming's engagement

141
00:12:20,111 --> 00:12:21,751
and force his fiancée to back off, right?

142
00:12:21,798 --> 00:12:24,028
- That's right. - Will she succeed, then?

143
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:25,495
That's impossible.

144
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:28,661
Richard's prenuptial agreement with the media tycoon's daughter is valid.

145
00:12:28,984 --> 00:12:30,847
They only compromised by adjusting certain parts of the agreement

146
00:12:30,871 --> 00:12:33,162
after Bai Xing Meng announced her pregnancy.

147
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,911
The media tycoon is prepared to hinder Bai Xing Meng's career

148
00:12:35,991 --> 00:12:37,322
with his resources.

149
00:12:37,471 --> 00:12:40,941
She has to think about how to survive as a single mother now.

150
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,990
This is the first case I took on since joining Junheng & Co.

151
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:46,768
I didn't expect it to end up like this.

152
00:12:46,869 --> 00:12:49,207
Bai Xing Meng can only blame herself for underestimating her foe.

153
00:12:49,231 --> 00:12:50,645
The benefits of a marriage alliance between two families

154
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:52,909
are far too great for a celebrity like her to influence.

155
00:12:57,334 --> 00:12:58,554
Boss,

156
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:03,557
did you stay silent all this while just so you could retaliate like this?

157
00:13:03,737 --> 00:13:04,749
I said so before.

158
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,290
Those who bully my employees will get what's coming to them.

159
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,082
Thank you, boss.

160
00:13:19,168 --> 00:13:20,642
It's not that difficult.

161
00:13:20,816 --> 00:13:22,036
I'm glad that you're happy.

162
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,571
I still have work to do. I'll resume my work now.

163
00:14:39,992 --> 00:14:41,212
This is great!

164
00:14:41,511 --> 00:14:42,967
I won a free voucher for mutton hotpot!

165
00:14:42,991 --> 00:14:45,071
Coincidentally, I don't need to work overtime today.

166
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,402
- Yu Fei. - I have a dinner appointment today.

167
00:14:47,968 --> 00:14:49,082
Tan Ying.

168
00:14:49,351 --> 00:14:50,631
I have a dinner appointment too.

169
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,522
What? You have a dinner appointment?

170
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,010
You too?

171
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:58,930
Are you two dating each other?

172
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,922
What time is it?

173
00:15:17,511 --> 00:15:19,620
Yeah, we're dating each other.

174
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,530
We're a couple now.

175
00:15:29,441 --> 00:15:30,522
Fine.

176
00:15:31,143 --> 00:15:32,363
You two are dating each other.

177
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,819
You two are a couple now, huh?

178
00:15:36,271 --> 00:15:37,491
Who are you trying to deceive?

179
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,190
Just tell me that you're not going.

180
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:43,127
There's no need to make up such a ridiculous lie. You two are a couple?

181
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:45,551
Why don't you say that the four of us are dating each other?

182
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,050
Just leave.

183
00:15:51,933 --> 00:15:53,153
He doesn't believe us.

184
00:15:55,176 --> 00:15:56,396
Cheng Yao,

185
00:15:56,727 --> 00:15:57,947
let's go.

186
00:15:59,534 --> 00:16:01,175
What do you think about a free meal?

187
00:16:01,256 --> 00:16:02,476
It's mutton hotpot, you know?

188
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,671
Bao Rui, I need you to retrieve a profile for me.

189
00:16:05,751 --> 00:16:06,971
I'll send you the address.

190
00:16:07,656 --> 00:16:08,876
Cheng Yao, stay here.

191
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,762
But I won a free voucher.

192
00:16:16,511 --> 00:16:17,731
It's fine.

193
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,870
No decent person will take free vouchers for a meal.

194
00:16:23,527 --> 00:16:24,882
Free vouchers?

195
00:16:25,225 --> 00:16:26,319
That means the food is worthless.

196
00:16:26,343 --> 00:16:27,563
There's no free lunch

197
00:16:27,669 --> 00:16:29,728
in the world anyway.

198
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,962
There goes my food voucher.

199
00:16:41,478 --> 00:16:42,478
Well...

200
00:16:43,297 --> 00:16:44,642
Can I send you home?

201
00:17:15,923 --> 00:17:17,366
Boss, I'll head back now.

202
00:17:30,984 --> 00:17:32,204
Cheng Yao,

203
00:17:34,007 --> 00:17:36,242
do you require housekeeping service?

204
00:17:44,952 --> 00:17:46,042
Thank you.

205
00:17:58,026 --> 00:17:59,246
So,

206
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:03,162
I made you cry when I told you to clean my villa.

207
00:18:03,302 --> 00:18:04,682
You can order me around now.

208
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,778
- Do you know how to do chores? - I don't.

209
00:18:08,415 --> 00:18:09,635
But I can learn.

210
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,010
Boss, what's wrong with you?

211
00:18:12,271 --> 00:18:13,491
It's nothing.

212
00:18:13,911 --> 00:18:15,282
This is your only chance.

213
00:18:15,478 --> 00:18:17,678
If you miss this time, you'll never get another chance.

214
00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:23,644
You can do it, then. The tools are in the washroom.

215
00:18:46,069 --> 00:18:48,682
- What's wrong? - It's nothing. This is...

216
00:18:49,722 --> 00:18:51,549
I didn't do it on purpose.

217
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,850
Be careful.

218
00:18:54,358 --> 00:18:56,578
You can clean the kitchen. Leave this place to me.

219
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,111
All right.

220
00:18:58,231 --> 00:18:59,451
Okay.

221
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:16,779
What's wrong?

222
00:19:21,311 --> 00:19:23,111
I think the quality of the plates is too low.

223
00:19:24,703 --> 00:19:25,962
Is your hand okay?

224
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,290
Yeah.

225
00:19:30,632 --> 00:19:32,910
Boss, my house looks super clean now.

226
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,621
Thank you for what you did today.

227
00:19:34,711 --> 00:19:36,162
You should head back and rest.

228
00:19:38,466 --> 00:19:39,647
I'll leave once I'm done cleaning here.

229
00:19:39,671 --> 00:19:40,874
It's okay. I'll clean them myself.

230
00:19:40,898 --> 00:19:42,118
I'll do it myself.

231
00:19:43,527 --> 00:19:44,747
Okay.

232
00:19:58,271 --> 00:19:59,491
Be careful.

233
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:14,974
(I need help.)

234
00:20:18,277 --> 00:20:20,560
(There's finally new progress here.)

235
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,799
(Brother, have you won the heart of your assistant?)

236
00:20:24,831 --> 00:20:27,580
(It seems like she dislikes how I'm courting her.)

237
00:20:29,151 --> 00:20:30,162
(What did you do?)

238
00:20:30,243 --> 00:20:32,005
(Did you do something inappropriate)

239
00:20:32,086 --> 00:20:33,430
(and made her unhappy?)

240
00:20:33,511 --> 00:20:36,722
(Did you rent a helicopter or set up a large screen and confess to her?)

241
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:39,585
(Don't tell me you tried to buy her off with money?)

242
00:20:40,901 --> 00:20:43,282
(I tried my best to make it up to her, )

243
00:20:43,671 --> 00:20:45,020
(but it backfired instead.)

244
00:20:51,442 --> 00:20:53,861
(Did you hit the wrong mark with your effort?)

245
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:57,402
(Maybe you bought her a cart of apples when she loved strawberries.)

246
00:21:01,145 --> 00:21:03,065
(All right. I'll buy her strawberries tomorrow.)

247
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,282
(That's not what I mean.)

248
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,310
(Brother, do you live in a 2G era?)

249
00:21:08,436 --> 00:21:10,082
(It was just a metaphor.)

250
00:21:10,229 --> 00:21:12,540
(Do you know what your assistant likes?)

251
00:21:14,401 --> 00:21:16,742
(Of course I do. She likes...)

252
00:21:32,215 --> 00:21:33,682
(Can you teach me)

253
00:21:33,777 --> 00:21:35,282
(what I should do?)

254
00:21:35,456 --> 00:21:36,802
(I want her)

255
00:21:36,883 --> 00:21:38,282
(to accept me.)

256
00:21:46,102 --> 00:21:47,702
What's inside a zoo?

257
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:48,990
- A tiger. - A lion.

258
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,606
- A lion. - Someone already said that.

259
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,126
- You said the same animal. - I meant lice.

260
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:54,030
No, you have to drink.

261
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,442
I'll get some ice cubes.

262
00:21:55,511 --> 00:21:57,470
- You're playing dirty. - Lice.

263
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,651
- It's different. - Please give me some ice cubes.

264
00:22:02,028 --> 00:22:03,682
(What's your Weibo account?)

265
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,522
What's my Weibo account?

266
00:22:08,271 --> 00:22:10,820
Do you like me that much?

267
00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:19,282
(You're still awake at this hour?)

268
00:22:20,681 --> 00:22:21,901
(I'm so honored.)

269
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:25,139
(But it's kind of embarrassing to type it out.)

270
00:22:25,406 --> 00:22:28,117
(It's Cutie Bao.)

271
00:22:41,934 --> 00:22:44,962
(Cutie Bao)

272
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,790
(Please let me strike the lottery.)

273
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:00,282
(This way, I don't need to work for my toxic boss.)

274
00:23:00,471 --> 00:23:02,500
(Toxic boss, please "go die.")

275
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,442
(What does go die mean?)

276
00:24:26,109 --> 00:24:27,616
(He's not here yet?)

277
00:24:28,077 --> 00:24:30,468
(Is he stuck in a jam? Or...)

278
00:24:35,947 --> 00:24:38,457
(I knew it. Men have no patience at all.)

279
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,656
Soup dumplings with crab roe.

280
00:24:58,814 --> 00:25:00,034
Have them while they're hot.

281
00:25:02,231 --> 00:25:05,971
Aren't these my favorite soup dumplings?

282
00:25:08,247 --> 00:25:09,467
I saw them on Weibo.

283
00:25:12,727 --> 00:25:14,202
You mean on my Weibo account?

284
00:25:16,517 --> 00:25:18,578
Boss, how did you find my Weibo account?

285
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:23,762
And, it's been a long time since I posted anything.

286
00:25:24,472 --> 00:25:26,072
I posted that so long ago.

287
00:25:26,153 --> 00:25:27,913
Did you read everything on my Weibo account?

288
00:25:30,751 --> 00:25:31,971
You posted this

289
00:25:33,385 --> 00:25:35,282
three months before

290
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:38,122
you posted the one where you told your vicious boss to "go die."

291
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:41,111
Boss, I posted that for fun.

292
00:25:41,231 --> 00:25:42,451
I didn't mean it.

293
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,730
It's fine. I thought it was pretty cute.

294
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,610
Is that so?

295
00:25:51,069 --> 00:25:53,910
So, are you okay with me shipping couples in novels

296
00:25:53,991 --> 00:25:56,580
and obsessing over handsome idols?

297
00:25:57,434 --> 00:25:58,633
Are you okay with that?

298
00:25:58,782 --> 00:26:01,110
Of course. This is your hobby.

299
00:26:01,191 --> 00:26:02,411
I respect you.

300
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:05,351
But in terms of personal charisma,

301
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:07,551
I don't think I'm inferior to any male celebrities you follow.

302
00:26:07,575 --> 00:26:09,322
You actually know the term "follow?"

303
00:26:10,007 --> 00:26:12,162
I have hands, you know? I can search for it online.

304
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,551
But let me make things clear.

305
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:14,859
You mustn't block me, okay?

306
00:26:16,944 --> 00:26:19,523
Boss, you learned quite a lot from the Internet, huh?

307
00:26:24,606 --> 00:26:25,698
Eat up.

308
00:26:29,511 --> 00:26:30,901
But this shop

309
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,267
is pretty famous online. It has a long queue.

310
00:26:33,348 --> 00:26:35,108
It should be quite far away from your villa.

311
00:26:36,063 --> 00:26:37,414
Don't tell me

312
00:26:37,711 --> 00:26:39,671
you went there and lined up early in the morning?

313
00:26:42,951 --> 00:26:45,359
It was already midnight when I finished reading your Weibo posts.

314
00:26:45,383 --> 00:26:46,602
I couldn't sleep anyway.

315
00:26:49,937 --> 00:26:51,157
Cheng Yao.

316
00:26:57,951 --> 00:26:59,171
Come with me.

317
00:27:01,097 --> 00:27:02,317
So...

318
00:27:05,431 --> 00:27:07,621
Cheng Yao, for the past two days,

319
00:27:07,812 --> 00:27:09,401
I...

320
00:27:10,176 --> 00:27:11,655
I want to make things clear.

321
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,671
No, I want to clarify something with you.

322
00:27:13,781 --> 00:27:16,370
Why does it seem like you're avoiding me

323
00:27:16,888 --> 00:27:18,362
after hearing what I said last time?

324
00:27:19,606 --> 00:27:21,087
Of course, I'm not forcing you here.

325
00:27:21,191 --> 00:27:22,500
What I wanted to say was...

326
00:27:24,723 --> 00:27:26,193
I guess that was it.

327
00:27:28,239 --> 00:27:30,242
Boss, I wasn't avoiding you.

328
00:27:30,471 --> 00:27:33,141
I just couldn't believe that you liked me.

329
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,922
After all, you're my boss.

330
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:38,431
What if you acted like how you did in the past?

331
00:27:38,511 --> 00:27:40,471
What if you tell me to scram when you're unhappy?

332
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,790
It'll be terrible for me.

333
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:42,990
That won't happen again.

334
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:45,671
I was strict with you before this.

335
00:27:45,751 --> 00:27:47,295
But it's because you were my subordinate.

336
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:49,101
I didn't want to lower my expectations of you.

337
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,145
And I hoped that you could grow faster.

338
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,090
But don't worry.

339
00:27:54,038 --> 00:27:55,602
From now on, I'll be there for you.

340
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,111
My professional guidance is yours.

341
00:27:58,238 --> 00:27:59,627
My time is yours.

342
00:28:03,031 --> 00:28:04,251
I'm yours too.

343
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:11,237
But your confession was too sudden.

344
00:28:12,031 --> 00:28:13,381
How could I know

345
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,487
if you were being serious or trying to fool around

346
00:28:15,511 --> 00:28:16,710
just for fun?

347
00:28:16,813 --> 00:28:18,444
Since when have I not been serious?

348
00:28:19,911 --> 00:28:23,020
You also said you liked your last blind date partner.

349
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:24,345
It's because...

350
00:28:26,197 --> 00:28:27,417
It's because

351
00:28:28,471 --> 00:28:29,820
I wanted you to be jealous.

352
00:28:36,295 --> 00:28:37,515
Cheng Yao,

353
00:28:38,424 --> 00:28:39,644
I truly like you.

354
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:41,610
I like you a lot.

355
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,090
I liked you long ago.

356
00:28:43,184 --> 00:28:45,973
Actually, I don't even know when I started liking you.

357
00:28:48,856 --> 00:28:51,671
I won't threaten or force the person I like

358
00:28:51,805 --> 00:28:53,025
nor will I give up on her.

359
00:28:56,511 --> 00:28:57,922
Are you willing

360
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,260
to give me this chance?

361
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,221
Cheng Yao, time for a meeting.

362
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,202
Time for a meeting, I guess.

363
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:48,020
Yeah. You should go now.

364
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,421
I'll go, then.

365
00:29:52,527 --> 00:29:54,237
Go ahead.

366
00:30:23,358 --> 00:30:25,788
Was that a yes? Or...

367
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:32,242
Yeah.

368
00:30:32,534 --> 00:30:33,962
I'm sure it's a yes.

369
00:30:40,967 --> 00:30:42,187
Bao Rui,

370
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:44,685
I need you to revise this for me.

371
00:30:51,444 --> 00:30:53,114
Didn't I tell you about this already?

372
00:31:05,704 --> 00:31:06,802
Boss,

373
00:31:07,464 --> 00:31:09,885
- there's no one inside. - You can go back now.

374
00:31:10,581 --> 00:31:11,801
That was terrifying.

375
00:31:53,784 --> 00:31:55,004
This is great!

376
00:31:55,207 --> 00:31:56,367
This is great!

377
00:31:56,471 --> 00:31:57,806
I finally discovered the trick to winning a free meal voucher!

378
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,050
Do you guys want to join me...

379
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,531
Why is the power out?

380
00:32:19,782 --> 00:32:21,002
I...

381
00:32:22,191 --> 00:32:24,510
You said you wanted spicy hotpot on Weibo. I bought them.

382
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,647
I even bought electric cookers to cook them for you.

383
00:32:26,671 --> 00:32:29,471
I switched on three of them together. And the circuit breaker tripped.

384
00:32:30,215 --> 00:32:32,053
So, you made me wait in the room until now

385
00:32:32,152 --> 00:32:33,562
so that you could cook them for me?

386
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,300
Why did you buy three of them, then?

387
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:39,207
One is mild, one is medium spicy, and one is super spicy.

388
00:32:39,231 --> 00:32:40,567
I don't know which flavor you like.

389
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:43,160
That's why I bought all of them, thinking that it would be a safe choice.

390
00:32:43,184 --> 00:32:44,984
I never expected the circuit breaker to trip.

391
00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:00,199
Boss, I still think that spicy hotpot

392
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,512
doesn't suit your style.

393
00:33:03,951 --> 00:33:06,141
I'm getting accustomed to my role as your boyfriend.

394
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,980
I'm also getting accustomed to the things you like.

395
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:11,871
And, in the future,

396
00:33:11,951 --> 00:33:13,260
don't treat me as your boss.

397
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,827
Stop calling me "boss" as well.

398
00:33:14,955 --> 00:33:16,464
But I'm already used to it.

399
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,282
You can change your habits, you know?

400
00:33:18,638 --> 00:33:20,678
I'll deduct your bonus if you call me "boss" again.

401
00:33:24,846 --> 00:33:26,066
I got it now.

402
00:33:26,655 --> 00:33:28,415
Regarding our relationship,

403
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:31,122
I need to put you on probation for a month.

404
00:33:31,428 --> 00:33:33,990
Why is there a probation period between a couple?

405
00:33:34,107 --> 00:33:36,391
I was under probation when I first joined Junheng & Co.

406
00:33:36,486 --> 00:33:37,762
And, it was a long period too.

407
00:33:38,061 --> 00:33:39,141
No bargaining allowed.

408
00:33:39,222 --> 00:33:41,291
If not, I'll extend your probation period.

409
00:33:42,991 --> 00:33:44,122
Question.

410
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:47,540
Will the probation period be shortened if I perform well?

411
00:33:49,841 --> 00:33:51,802
It depends on your performance.

412
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:55,461
Since I'm free tonight, I'll draft the terms later.

413
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:59,242
Cheng Yao, I suspect that you're getting back at me.

414
00:33:59,369 --> 00:34:00,589
You're right.

415
00:34:01,766 --> 00:34:03,006
However, my terms

416
00:34:03,087 --> 00:34:06,024
won't be as many as the terms you drafted when we were renting this unit.

417
00:34:06,391 --> 00:34:09,550
At most, it'll be something like: "Party B, Qian Heng,

418
00:34:09,678 --> 00:34:11,967
cannot coerce Party A into doing something with his status as her boss.

419
00:34:11,991 --> 00:34:14,571
He's not allowed to talk about deducting her wage for no reason

420
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:16,522
or act like a domineering boss."

421
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,490
Is that all?

422
00:34:21,175 --> 00:34:22,395
All right.

423
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:23,770
I agree to all of them.

424
00:34:24,055 --> 00:34:26,042
If so, does Party B have any rights?

425
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:28,487
For example, if he regrets his decision and wishes to move back here?

426
00:34:28,511 --> 00:34:30,310
Party B has no rights

427
00:34:30,397 --> 00:34:32,587
before the probation period is over.

428
00:34:33,791 --> 00:34:35,442
But tomorrow is the weekend.

429
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:38,651
What if Party B wants to go on a date with Party A?

430
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,628
If so, Party A will be there on time.

431
00:35:23,126 --> 00:35:24,922
I think...

432
00:35:25,303 --> 00:35:27,691
Party A thinks Party B can return home now.

433
00:35:28,712 --> 00:35:32,101
Party A will fix the circuit and enjoy all three pots of

434
00:35:32,627 --> 00:35:33,667
spicy hotpot later.

435
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,190
Let me fix this for you.

436
00:35:35,271 --> 00:35:37,802
It's fine. Party A thinks Party B can return home now.

437
00:35:37,905 --> 00:35:39,125
Go home now.

438
00:36:53,682 --> 00:36:56,633
- Boss, this is... - The window is dirty.

439
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:59,002
Get in the car.

440
00:37:57,117 --> 00:37:58,917
I'm just helping you to put on the seat belt.

441
00:37:58,951 --> 00:38:00,900
You don't need to look that surprised.

442
00:38:03,313 --> 00:38:05,682
Boss, do you know the term "moe gap?"

443
00:38:05,913 --> 00:38:07,182
In the past,

444
00:38:07,343 --> 00:38:08,882
you were my domineering boss.

445
00:38:09,976 --> 00:38:11,196
What about now?

446
00:38:22,302 --> 00:38:24,283
Did you smell something strange?

447
00:38:29,429 --> 00:38:31,458
No. You must be mistaken.

448
00:38:31,846 --> 00:38:33,066
No way.

449
00:38:37,062 --> 00:38:38,642
I have a keen sense of smell.

450
00:38:39,162 --> 00:38:42,340
It smells like weird shampoo with Chinese herbs in it.

451
00:38:44,391 --> 00:38:45,611
What?

452
00:38:45,692 --> 00:38:46,877
(Wu Jun)

453
00:38:46,964 --> 00:38:49,791
- What? - (How's the perfume I recommended to your friend?)

454
00:38:49,935 --> 00:38:52,416
(That's Aichi's Perfume No. 14.)

455
00:38:52,549 --> 00:38:54,198
(A mixture of lemon and cypress.)

456
00:38:54,279 --> 00:38:56,042
(It has a savory and moist smell.)

457
00:38:56,211 --> 00:38:57,562
(Isn't it sexy?)

458
00:38:58,944 --> 00:39:00,962
Have you lost your mind?

459
00:39:05,277 --> 00:39:06,882
Boss, where are we going?

460
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,922
Wait.

461
00:39:11,256 --> 00:39:12,486
I mean, Qian.

462
00:39:13,311 --> 00:39:14,762
Where are we going for our date?

463
00:39:15,471 --> 00:39:17,482
What kinds of places do you frequent in the past?

464
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,562
The kinds of places I frequented?

465
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,850
The office.

466
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,749
You should decide on the venue.

467
00:39:25,773 --> 00:39:27,674
Where did you go for your dates in the past?

468
00:39:28,471 --> 00:39:29,860
I've never been on a date before.

469
00:39:35,002 --> 00:39:36,832
Why don't we ask Lawyer Wu, then?

470
00:39:38,796 --> 00:39:40,722
No need for that. Why are we asking him?

471
00:39:40,997 --> 00:39:42,587
Dating isn't that hard.

472
00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:46,202
Everywhere is a date

473
00:39:46,486 --> 00:39:48,002
as long as I'm with you.

474
00:39:48,198 --> 00:39:49,589
Boss, are you nervous?

475
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:52,590
It's a little hot in here.

476
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,602
You're sweating so much.

477
00:40:18,622 --> 00:40:19,863
Mister, Miss, nice to meet you.

478
00:40:19,944 --> 00:40:22,166
We're doing a survey on adults and the pressure they face in life.

479
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:24,470
- Can you spare us a few minutes? - No thanks.

480
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,780
No thanks.

481
00:40:26,031 --> 00:40:28,391
You two look like a match in heaven.

482
00:40:28,472 --> 00:40:30,352
I'm sure you guys face no pressure as a couple.

483
00:40:33,016 --> 00:40:34,796
- Give me your pen. - Okay. Thank you.

484
00:40:36,786 --> 00:40:38,442
Yes. Write here.

485
00:40:44,654 --> 00:40:45,739
Okay. Thank you for your cooperation.

486
00:40:45,763 --> 00:40:47,922
This is our gift for you. Thank you.

487
00:40:48,209 --> 00:40:50,691
Why are you willing to do surveys now?

488
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:52,802
It's because I liked what she said.

489
00:40:57,322 --> 00:40:58,642
What did they give us?

490
00:40:58,848 --> 00:41:00,237
It's nothing. Let's go.

491
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:18,922
Why did you bring me to have pizza?

492
00:41:19,325 --> 00:41:22,145
I saw your Weibo post last week. You said you wanted pizza.
