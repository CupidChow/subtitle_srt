1
00:01:35,503 --> 00:01:38,762
(My Boss)

2
00:01:40,202 --> 00:01:43,213
(Episode 31: Must I leave Junheng & Co)

3
00:01:43,294 --> 00:01:46,042
(before my ability can be proven?)

4
00:02:10,466 --> 00:02:11,688
Happy 100th-day anniversary.

5
00:02:16,977 --> 00:02:18,287
Why are you still here?

6
00:02:19,586 --> 00:02:21,616
I thought you already left.

7
00:02:21,757 --> 00:02:23,802
I rushed back home just now.

8
00:02:23,883 --> 00:02:26,369
I thought I didn't make it in time when I didn't see your baggage.

9
00:02:26,506 --> 00:02:27,816
Luckily, you're still here.

10
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:31,882
Were you drenched when you were coming back? It was raining just now.

11
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:33,387
I'm fine.

12
00:02:34,338 --> 00:02:36,378
Okay. Everything's fine now.

13
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:37,678
Everything's fine.

14
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,949
I kept my baggage in the trunk.

15
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,242
But what about your flight?

16
00:02:46,338 --> 00:02:47,602
I delayed it.

17
00:02:47,906 --> 00:02:49,938
I'm flying tomorrow. I already promised you

18
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,762
that we were going to celebrate it together.

19
00:02:54,145 --> 00:02:55,365
You're so nice.

20
00:02:56,633 --> 00:02:58,442
- Thank you.   - Okay now.

21
00:02:58,637 --> 00:02:59,857
Stop crying, okay?

22
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:01,362
I have a present for you.

23
00:03:09,327 --> 00:03:11,077
How did you know that I desired this?

24
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,657
After you told me about it,

25
00:03:13,738 --> 00:03:15,698
I bribed Tan Ying as her boss.

26
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,270
I thought of buying this when you sent it to her.

27
00:03:20,903 --> 00:03:22,454
But didn't you say

28
00:03:22,938 --> 00:03:25,047
wearing a couple necklace wasn't classy at all?

29
00:03:25,226 --> 00:03:26,446
Silly girl.

30
00:03:26,697 --> 00:03:27,917
You chose it, you know?

31
00:03:29,657 --> 00:03:31,162
Come, let me put it on for you.

32
00:03:35,417 --> 00:03:36,637
Come.

33
00:03:52,417 --> 00:03:54,169
- Do you like it?   - I do.

34
00:03:57,614 --> 00:03:58,834
It looks nice.

35
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:36,461
That was ticklish.

36
00:05:07,423 --> 00:05:08,643
Is anyone in there?

37
00:05:10,549 --> 00:05:11,820
If not, I'll go in now.

38
00:05:52,742 --> 00:05:54,202
(I left as I was taking an early flight.)

39
00:05:54,418 --> 00:05:56,019
(I didn't wake you up since you were sound asleep.)

40
00:05:56,152 --> 00:06:00,007
(And, this is the true present I prepared for you.)

41
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:02,482
(The netizens said I should buy luxury items for you.)

42
00:06:02,621 --> 00:06:05,898
(But I think I'm more precious than any luxury items out there.)

43
00:06:06,128 --> 00:06:08,488
(He can keep you company when I'm not around.)

44
00:06:10,143 --> 00:06:11,363
Idiot.

45
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:59,129
(Be nicer to me.)

46
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,595
(Take good care of yourself when I'm not around.)

47
00:07:02,777 --> 00:07:04,848
(Don't worry about me. Take good care of yourself too.)

48
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,227
(Look after Cheng Yao when I'm not around.)

49
00:07:28,707 --> 00:07:30,577
(Don't worry. I know what to do.)

50
00:07:30,704 --> 00:07:33,453
(After all, you have the goods on Yu Fei.)

51
00:07:47,738 --> 00:07:50,778
Senior, aren't you supposed to be above the Asian-European continent now?

52
00:07:50,866 --> 00:07:52,736
What's wrong? Was the flight delayed?

53
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:54,068
Lawyer Liang,

54
00:07:54,495 --> 00:07:56,835
I think the law firm has taken on enough cases for now.

55
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,230
When I'm not around,

56
00:07:59,366 --> 00:08:01,346
I hope you can give Cheng Yao a chance to polish her skills.

57
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:05,016
I thought something happened to the law firm.

58
00:08:05,136 --> 00:08:06,725
So, it's just this, huh?

59
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,670
You never forget about your girlfriend even when you're on a business trip.

60
00:08:09,846 --> 00:08:11,802
You're indeed different from your college days.

61
00:08:12,782 --> 00:08:14,442
Not only is Cheng Yao my girlfriend,

62
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:16,762
but she's also an outstanding employee that I've nurtured.

63
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:19,218
I don't want her to receive any special treatments

64
00:08:19,393 --> 00:08:21,314
because of my relationship with her.

65
00:08:21,457 --> 00:08:24,362
(I believe in her ability. She won't disappoint you.)

66
00:08:24,636 --> 00:08:27,589
Don't worry. This is your first time making such an official request.

67
00:08:27,712 --> 00:08:29,042
I'll definitely keep it in mind.

68
00:08:30,938 --> 00:08:31,961
(By the way, Senior,)

69
00:08:32,042 --> 00:08:34,582
I have a personal favor to ask of you.

70
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,060
Go ahead.

71
00:08:36,961 --> 00:08:38,710
It does sound embarrassing.

72
00:08:39,497 --> 00:08:42,082
There's a new lipstick model that's only available overseas.

73
00:08:42,324 --> 00:08:44,419
(Can you buy it for me when you come back?)

74
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:45,798
No problem.

75
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:47,242
I'll leave Cheng Yao to you, then.

76
00:08:47,617 --> 00:08:49,382
Okay. Don't worry.

77
00:08:50,938 --> 00:08:51,938
Hello, Mr. Qian.

78
00:08:52,018 --> 00:08:53,777
Your flight will depart soon.

79
00:08:53,857 --> 00:08:55,017
Please follow me.

80
00:08:55,174 --> 00:08:56,282
Okay.

81
00:08:56,792 --> 00:08:58,218
Didn't I tell you this before?

82
00:08:58,298 --> 00:09:00,395
You must filter the cases you take on.

83
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:03,458
Elderly divorce cases like these are troublesome and unprofitable.

84
00:09:03,621 --> 00:09:05,098
Tell Mr. Li

85
00:09:05,302 --> 00:09:07,411
that I cannot take on this case.

86
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:11,036
Lawyer Liang.

87
00:09:12,606 --> 00:09:14,682
Have you verified the client's details?

88
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,031
The registered capital, shareholder structure, and actual controllers

89
00:09:17,112 --> 00:09:18,911
of the companies under the client's name

90
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:20,698
had been verified with

91
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:23,137
the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System

92
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,114
and a third-party query terminal.

93
00:09:25,195 --> 00:09:26,358
Everything is fine.

94
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:29,037
You even prepared the evidence material for the second instance court?

95
00:09:29,846 --> 00:09:30,926
These are the printed copies.

96
00:09:31,007 --> 00:09:32,218
I already uploaded the e-copy.

97
00:09:32,336 --> 00:09:33,821
I've made an appointment with the judge

98
00:09:33,902 --> 00:09:35,462
to proceed with the exchange of evidence tomorrow.

99
00:09:39,632 --> 00:09:42,162
You did a precise and thorough job.

100
00:09:42,867 --> 00:09:44,622
Before this, I made you an assistant

101
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:47,137
to know more about your personality and ability.

102
00:09:47,307 --> 00:09:49,617
Second, I wanted to train your patience.

103
00:09:49,751 --> 00:09:50,951
Third,

104
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,687
as everyone knows about your relationship with Qian Heng,

105
00:09:53,837 --> 00:09:55,946
the others will not be convinced of your ability

106
00:09:56,058 --> 00:09:57,562
if you handle a major case alone after joining my team.

107
00:09:57,758 --> 00:09:59,958
However, you've done a great job all this while.

108
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,259
It's time for you to be independent.

109
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,968
I have a divorce case on my hands.

110
00:10:05,543 --> 00:10:07,224
The amount is around five million yuan, which is not a lot.

111
00:10:07,338 --> 00:10:08,773
However, the client is a local elderly.

112
00:10:08,854 --> 00:10:10,377
If you do a good job with the elderly's case,

113
00:10:10,457 --> 00:10:12,518
you'll receive banners easily.

114
00:10:13,018 --> 00:10:14,058
No problem.

115
00:10:14,184 --> 00:10:15,888
Thank you, Lawyer Liang. I'll do my best.

116
00:10:16,463 --> 00:10:18,663
I started out taking on these kinds of cases too.

117
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,581
Do your best. Find me if you have any questions.

118
00:10:24,288 --> 00:10:26,202
Lawyer Liang, didn't you say

119
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:28,570
you wanted to return the case to Mr. Li?

120
00:10:29,138 --> 00:10:30,402
Lawyer Qian said before

121
00:10:30,507 --> 00:10:32,968
that Cheng Yao is a lawyer with extraordinary working capabilities.

122
00:10:33,463 --> 00:10:34,852
We must have confidence in her.

123
00:10:35,785 --> 00:10:37,005
Okay.

124
00:10:50,615 --> 00:10:52,886
Hello, is this Wu Jie's house?

125
00:10:53,593 --> 00:10:55,334
You must be from the law firm.

126
00:10:55,415 --> 00:10:56,635
Come in.

127
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:00,175
Bring that box inside for me.

128
00:11:05,418 --> 00:11:06,638
Here.

129
00:11:10,538 --> 00:11:12,248
All the valuable items are in here.

130
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,933
Lawyer Zhang, look at this.

131
00:11:15,457 --> 00:11:16,807
It's Hai-O.

132
00:11:18,432 --> 00:11:19,551
Jot it down for me.

133
00:11:19,632 --> 00:11:20,852
No problem.

134
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,998
Madam, I'm Lawyer Cheng.

135
00:11:24,406 --> 00:11:25,626
It doesn't matter.

136
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:28,341
It was expensive when I bought this back then.

137
00:11:31,097 --> 00:11:32,317
And this.

138
00:11:32,497 --> 00:11:34,777
This was the most expensive radio back then.

139
00:11:34,858 --> 00:11:37,497
I think it was over 200 yuan.

140
00:11:37,577 --> 00:11:39,837
- Jot it down.   - Okay.

141
00:11:40,686 --> 00:11:42,042
There's an old phone.

142
00:11:42,297 --> 00:11:44,247
And the 555 desk clock.

143
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,053
Jot all of them down.

144
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,426
Regarding this...

145
00:11:50,507 --> 00:11:54,338
Although we didn't spend money on this photo,

146
00:11:54,522 --> 00:11:57,218
it was because the photographer was my friend.

147
00:11:57,368 --> 00:11:59,678
After that, I gave him a hen.

148
00:12:00,534 --> 00:12:04,725
Nowadays, I think an old hen

149
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:06,343
costs over 100 yuan.

150
00:12:06,454 --> 00:12:08,164
I'll count it as 100 yuan. Jot it down.

151
00:12:09,778 --> 00:12:11,767
Oh yeah, and the two pots of orchids.

152
00:12:12,383 --> 00:12:14,024
That old fool bought them

153
00:12:14,194 --> 00:12:15,777
in an international orchid conference.

154
00:12:15,857 --> 00:12:17,035
It was so expensive.

155
00:12:17,116 --> 00:12:19,098
I told him not to buy it, but he bought it anyway.

156
00:12:19,248 --> 00:12:21,522
If he takes them away from me,

157
00:12:21,886 --> 00:12:23,887
I'll deduct the price. Jot it down.

158
00:12:23,968 --> 00:12:25,188
No problem.

159
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:27,925
Madam Wu,

160
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:29,989
should we go to a cafe or something?

161
00:12:33,728 --> 00:12:35,162
I bought this TV

162
00:12:35,646 --> 00:12:38,197
with vouchers back then.

163
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:39,527
Jot it down.

164
00:12:39,608 --> 00:12:42,659
I mustn't let that old fool earn an extra cent from me.

165
00:12:42,778 --> 00:12:45,047
No problem. I'll do my best to fight for your interest.

166
00:12:46,304 --> 00:12:47,668
One Americano. Thank you.

167
00:12:48,671 --> 00:12:52,221
Give me a cup of rose latte without sugar.

168
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:55,157
I want a caramel mousse.

169
00:12:55,887 --> 00:12:57,527
An Oreo and banana waffle,

170
00:12:57,608 --> 00:12:58,830
and a tiramisu.

171
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,033
Yes, a tiramisu.

172
00:13:00,114 --> 00:13:03,368
Give me mashed potatoes with ham.

173
00:13:04,372 --> 00:13:07,442
And a yogurt pudding. I love puddings.

174
00:13:07,863 --> 00:13:09,862
Give me a yogurt pudding.

175
00:13:10,537 --> 00:13:12,362
And a strawberry mango mousse.

176
00:13:13,122 --> 00:13:14,257
Lawyer Cheng,

177
00:13:14,434 --> 00:13:18,257
treating your clients to coffee is considered a business meal, right?

178
00:13:18,438 --> 00:13:19,748
You can be reimbursed for it, right?

179
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,048
That's right.

180
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,876
You should've told me earlier.

181
00:13:23,739 --> 00:13:27,657
I saw that you guys were selling classic gift boxes out there.

182
00:13:27,737 --> 00:13:29,178
Am I right? I want two boxes.

183
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,442
I'll take them when I'm leaving.

184
00:13:31,539 --> 00:13:32,759
All right. Please wait a moment.

185
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,896
Actually, a meal like this

186
00:13:43,101 --> 00:13:45,802
is nothing to your law firm, right?

187
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,138
After all, you guys charge a lot for your services.

188
00:13:52,968 --> 00:13:54,362
Cheng,

189
00:13:54,676 --> 00:13:58,328
you know about the condition of my family too.

190
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,217
After I get a divorce,

191
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:04,128
I won't have much left.

192
00:14:04,669 --> 00:14:05,869
So,

193
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,887
I wish to discuss this with you.

194
00:14:08,161 --> 00:14:10,007
Can you do a kind deed

195
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,700
and reduce my attorney fee?

196
00:14:15,128 --> 00:14:16,908
Madam, attorney fees are determined

197
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:19,179
based on the government's guidance and market regulation.

198
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:20,887
We follow a strict two-way rule.

199
00:14:21,144 --> 00:14:22,983
I cannot decide that myself.

200
00:14:23,075 --> 00:14:25,698
Moreover, your fee is already the lowest among all of our divorce cases.

201
00:14:25,856 --> 00:14:27,617
Stop your useless chatter.

202
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,551
It's just a lawsuit.

203
00:14:29,924 --> 00:14:32,073
What do you mean by a two-way rule?

204
00:14:33,232 --> 00:14:35,631
Young lawyers like you guys have it easy.

205
00:14:35,715 --> 00:14:38,287
You guys make a lot of money by just talking.

206
00:14:38,637 --> 00:14:40,337
Madam, your so-called "talking"

207
00:14:40,425 --> 00:14:42,724
requires a lot of time and professional experience too.

208
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:46,299
Cheng,

209
00:14:46,647 --> 00:14:47,957
what about this?

210
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:50,762
I'll help get you a boyfriend.

211
00:14:50,989 --> 00:14:52,896
I know a lot of people.

212
00:14:53,062 --> 00:14:55,342
Some of them have a great family background.

213
00:14:55,481 --> 00:14:57,242
I'll get you a boyfriend

214
00:14:57,389 --> 00:15:00,042
while you reduce my attorney fee.

215
00:15:00,911 --> 00:15:03,927
We'll be even, then. It's your gain.

216
00:15:05,017 --> 00:15:06,293
Madam, let's do the inventory count.

217
00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:07,808
After all, the time you spend chatting with me

218
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:09,482
is included in the consultation time.

219
00:15:10,429 --> 00:15:11,629
This doesn't make sense at all.

220
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,442
If so, I'll have to complain about you.

221
00:15:14,582 --> 00:15:16,497
You guys charge us money for everything you do.

222
00:15:16,577 --> 00:15:18,657
Even the time we eat and walk.

223
00:15:18,807 --> 00:15:20,102
You're charging me for that?

224
00:15:20,183 --> 00:15:21,733
That doesn't make sense at all.

225
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:23,618
What about this?

226
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:27,144
Let's treat our coffee time and travel time as 20 minutes.

227
00:15:27,238 --> 00:15:28,483
Do you think that's okay?

228
00:15:28,888 --> 00:15:30,678
Do you think 20 minutes are enough?

229
00:15:30,816 --> 00:15:33,488
It took at least 30 minutes, you know?

230
00:15:34,418 --> 00:15:35,638
All right.

231
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:45,737
Here. It's time for afternoon tea.

232
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,111
Have something sweet.

233
00:15:47,192 --> 00:15:49,022
No matter how busy you are, you have to rest somehow.

234
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,271
I thought you liked fruit-flavored desserts.

235
00:15:51,352 --> 00:15:52,861
Why did you buy chocolate-flavored ones?

236
00:15:53,616 --> 00:15:54,639
I bought it with my points.

237
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,190
Only your favorite flavor was available.

238
00:15:57,697 --> 00:15:59,316
Is there anything you cannot finish?

239
00:15:59,409 --> 00:16:01,137
You can leave them to me. I'm free today.

240
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,869
Qian Heng told you to look after me, right?

241
00:16:05,337 --> 00:16:08,017
He's holding Yu Fei hostage now.

242
00:16:08,198 --> 00:16:10,657
I'm doing this so that Yu Fei won't be bullied.

243
00:16:10,792 --> 00:16:11,853
It's a fair trade.

244
00:16:11,965 --> 00:16:14,718
I never expected you to bow down because of a man.

245
00:16:15,258 --> 00:16:17,767
I have to devote myself to the relationship somehow.

246
00:16:18,066 --> 00:16:19,858
What about you? Where did you get all this evidence?

247
00:16:20,007 --> 00:16:21,677
I thought you were dealing with a tycoon's divorce case.

248
00:16:24,535 --> 00:16:26,124
Two toilet brushes, 13 yuan 60 cents.

249
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,310
There's worse. Two screw caps for 80 cents.

250
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,078
You gave up on so many profitable trust cases

251
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,017
just to deal with an old lady's divorce case?

252
00:16:36,144 --> 00:16:37,991
Lawyer Qian will definitely be furious if he finds out.

253
00:16:39,617 --> 00:16:40,927
It's not that bad.

254
00:16:41,058 --> 00:16:43,098
If we take on local cases,

255
00:16:43,237 --> 00:16:45,698
it can help our firm to win the Golden Scale Award.

256
00:16:45,793 --> 00:16:48,842
This is more than just local. It's more like a mess.

257
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,469
Aren't you afraid that you might fear marriage after taking on such cases?

258
00:16:51,617 --> 00:16:54,047
Many tycoon divorce cases end up as a mess.

259
00:16:54,878 --> 00:16:56,818
I do think that if both parties

260
00:16:56,898 --> 00:16:58,538
understand each other in a marriage,

261
00:16:58,633 --> 00:17:00,143
they can clean the mess up together.

262
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:02,141
However, if one of them wishes to communicate

263
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:04,137
while the other wishes to idle around,

264
00:17:04,217 --> 00:17:05,882
that will be the end of their marriage.

265
00:17:06,499 --> 00:17:07,522
All right.

266
00:17:07,822 --> 00:17:10,520
Now, I think Lawyer Qian is lucky

267
00:17:10,601 --> 00:17:12,122
to get a philosophical girlfriend like you.

268
00:17:12,473 --> 00:17:13,633
All right, philosopher.

269
00:17:13,714 --> 00:17:15,617
These two feather dusters cost 7 yuan 90 cents.

270
00:17:15,728 --> 00:17:16,948
Jot them down.

271
00:17:17,184 --> 00:17:18,503
Call me if you need anything. Remember to have them.

272
00:17:18,584 --> 00:17:19,804
Thanks.

273
00:18:01,534 --> 00:18:03,746
Mr. Qian. It's been a great pleasure

274
00:18:03,886 --> 00:18:06,044
working with you and your team.

275
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:09,578
We appreciate your professionalism.

276
00:18:09,728 --> 00:18:11,717
It improved our efficiency tremendously.

277
00:18:12,183 --> 00:18:13,216
You're welcome.

278
00:18:13,362 --> 00:18:15,762
As you all know, efficiency is my principle.

279
00:18:17,378 --> 00:18:20,362
And, could you tell me where is the nearest coastline?

280
00:18:23,864 --> 00:18:26,249
(Yao Yao, are you still working in the firm?)

281
00:18:26,457 --> 00:18:28,528
Didn't Tan Ying tell you that already?

282
00:18:30,257 --> 00:18:32,322
(I heard that you took on a troublesome divorce case lately.)

283
00:18:32,672 --> 00:18:34,442
(How was it?)

284
00:18:36,217 --> 00:18:39,568
Why is your smile still in my mind even when you're not around?

285
00:18:39,865 --> 00:18:41,294
Do you really think I'm a kid?

286
00:18:42,231 --> 00:18:43,451
Don't worry.

287
00:18:43,605 --> 00:18:46,617
I'm a super lawyer who endured your torture.

288
00:18:46,698 --> 00:18:49,061
I can deal with all kinds of clients no matter how troublesome they are.

289
00:18:49,537 --> 00:18:50,629
(All right.)

290
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,934
(You always said that you wanted to admire the sea view abroad)

291
00:18:54,046 --> 00:18:56,077
(but you didn't have the chance, right?)

292
00:18:56,697 --> 00:18:57,917
(Look.)

293
00:19:03,206 --> 00:19:05,857
(My colleagues over here said the sea view in Southern France was amazing.)

294
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:07,446
(That's why I came here to take a look.)

295
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:10,399
I thought you went to Switzerland for the business trip.

296
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,551
Did you drive all the way to Southern France?

297
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,372
How long did you drive?

298
00:19:14,616 --> 00:19:16,755
Don't you need to rest after working?

299
00:19:17,349 --> 00:19:18,628
(Our case ended early.)

300
00:19:18,808 --> 00:19:22,002
(I told you that all my time was meant for you except for working hours.)

301
00:19:23,578 --> 00:19:26,288
Point the camera at yourself.

302
00:19:34,102 --> 00:19:35,732
All right, I'm going to work now.

303
00:19:37,129 --> 00:19:40,399
Let's admire the sea view together next time if we have the chance.

304
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,002
(Okay. Goodbye.)

305
00:20:01,042 --> 00:20:04,202
(Liang Yi Ran)

306
00:20:16,338 --> 00:20:17,882
You did great with the documents.

307
00:20:20,425 --> 00:20:22,306
By the way, I heard

308
00:20:22,418 --> 00:20:24,338
that this client of ours was hard to deal with.

309
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,282
I hope there wasn't any conflict between you two.

310
00:20:27,068 --> 00:20:29,242
Lawyer Wu said we must be empathetic to our clients,

311
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:30,749
especially those going through a divorce.

312
00:20:35,297 --> 00:20:36,911
All right, you can resume your work.

313
00:20:36,992 --> 00:20:38,261
I'll notify you if there's anything.

314
00:20:43,497 --> 00:20:44,717
Zhang,

315
00:20:44,903 --> 00:20:46,332
check it for her again.

316
00:20:46,687 --> 00:20:48,086
After all, she's inexperienced.

317
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,756
I don't want anything to go wrong.

318
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:52,216
Lawyer Liang, that's unnecessary. I've already checked it twice.

319
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:55,086
It's my first time seeing such a comprehensive evidence list.

320
00:20:56,527 --> 00:20:58,827
You do give Cheng Yao a high rating, huh?

321
00:20:59,248 --> 00:21:00,758
She's always been serious at work.

322
00:21:01,487 --> 00:21:04,276
It's no wonder Lawyer Qian admires her.

323
00:21:04,456 --> 00:21:07,362
Lawyer Liang, there's a case I can't handle. Why don't I pass it to her?

324
00:21:07,504 --> 00:21:10,174
Don't try to shift your work to someone else.

325
00:21:10,615 --> 00:21:13,777
Such a lazy display of work ethic shouldn't appear on my team.

326
00:21:13,858 --> 00:21:15,078
Go back.

327
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:16,909
I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

328
00:21:35,842 --> 00:21:38,717
(Lawyer Liang, how's the progress of Cheng Yao's case?)

329
00:21:43,858 --> 00:21:46,943
(She's doing great. Lawyer Qian, you were right about her indeed.)

330
00:21:50,787 --> 00:21:52,738
(Thank you. I knew it.)

331
00:21:53,122 --> 00:21:54,442
(She's special indeed.)

332
00:23:09,457 --> 00:23:12,082
She's just a normal law student who didn't graduate from a famous college.

333
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,442
What's so special about her?

334
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:52,778
Where did it go?

335
00:23:52,858 --> 00:23:54,162
Could it be that you left it at home?

336
00:23:54,263 --> 00:23:55,802
Impossible. I never took it with me.

337
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:58,242
I kept all the evidence in this drawer.

338
00:23:58,984 --> 00:24:01,533
You're just good for display, huh? You can't even keep a stack of IOUs.

339
00:24:03,977 --> 00:24:05,579
Shut up if you're not helping.

340
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:08,042
Aren't you afraid that you'll receive karma for gloating on her misery?

341
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:10,045
Did someone take it?

342
00:24:10,377 --> 00:24:13,097
But only those with access cards can gain access to our floor.

343
00:24:13,178 --> 00:24:14,967
And, we need to scan our thumbprint before coming in.

344
00:24:15,697 --> 00:24:17,738
Is there a spy? Should we retrieve the surveillance camera footage?

345
00:24:17,848 --> 00:24:19,078
There's no time.

346
00:24:19,961 --> 00:24:21,181
The trial will begin soon.

347
00:24:22,737 --> 00:24:24,368
What kind of lawyer are you?

348
00:24:25,337 --> 00:24:27,537
So what if you're pretty?

349
00:24:27,641 --> 00:24:28,841
You're so bad at your job.

350
00:24:28,922 --> 00:24:30,967
You just look good on the surface!

351
00:24:31,297 --> 00:24:35,204
How dare you lose such important evidence of mine?

352
00:24:35,297 --> 00:24:37,298
Your head must be filled with crap.

353
00:24:37,425 --> 00:24:38,645
I'm sorry, Madam Wu.

354
00:24:38,969 --> 00:24:40,538
This was indeed my negligence.

355
00:24:40,711 --> 00:24:41,931
But calm down.

356
00:24:42,338 --> 00:24:43,591
I can help you obtain the 100,000 yuan

357
00:24:43,672 --> 00:24:45,727
even if we don't have the original document.

358
00:24:45,967 --> 00:24:47,356
With what?

359
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:49,797
You already lost the IOU. How can you fight for it now?

360
00:24:49,938 --> 00:24:52,913
Madam Wu, photocopied evidence can be used as corroborative evidence too.

361
00:24:53,087 --> 00:24:54,578
What are you saying?

362
00:24:54,658 --> 00:24:57,277
Don't try to fool me with those fancy terms.

363
00:24:57,378 --> 00:24:59,295
Do you think I don't know what you're up to?

364
00:24:59,376 --> 00:25:01,982
Listen, if I lose the 100,000 yuan,

365
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,482
if the court doesn't award it to me,

366
00:25:03,563 --> 00:25:04,797
you have to compensate me for it.

367
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,098
No problem.

368
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:08,519
If you lose 100,000 yuan because of that,

369
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,922
I'll compensate you myself.

370
00:25:10,098 --> 00:25:12,368
- But Cheng Yao...   - Why should I trust you?

371
00:25:13,626 --> 00:25:16,407
What about this? Madam Wu, I'll write a letter of commitment.

372
00:25:16,911 --> 00:25:20,216
If you lose 100,000 yuan because I lost the original document,

373
00:25:20,344 --> 00:25:22,258
I, Cheng Yao, will pay you, Madam Wu Jie, personally.

374
00:25:22,393 --> 00:25:23,613
Is that okay?

375
00:25:28,953 --> 00:25:30,183
It's fine.

376
00:25:30,658 --> 00:25:32,177
Lawyers are humans too.

377
00:25:32,335 --> 00:25:34,285
It's normal for one to underperform sometimes.

378
00:25:37,471 --> 00:25:39,020
She's your junior at Junheng & Co, right?

379
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,900
Madam Wu, take a look.

380
00:25:46,647 --> 00:25:47,647
This is the copy.

381
00:25:47,728 --> 00:25:50,108
You can sign immediately if you have no issue with it.

382
00:25:51,295 --> 00:25:52,926
Let me say this first.

383
00:25:53,298 --> 00:25:55,778
If the court doesn't award me the 100,000 yuan,

384
00:25:55,935 --> 00:25:57,645
I'll get the money from you on that very day.

385
00:25:58,175 --> 00:25:59,395
No problem.

386
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,070
I'll give you the full sum.

387
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,018
It's still early anyway.

388
00:26:07,168 --> 00:26:08,638
Why don't we go and take a walk?

389
00:26:08,898 --> 00:26:11,008
Let's go. Maybe you'll get into the zone by then.

390
00:26:11,906 --> 00:26:13,126
Let's go.

391
00:26:14,481 --> 00:26:15,721
Wu Jie's attorney is making a claim that the defendant

392
00:26:15,802 --> 00:26:18,887
wrote a 100,000 yuan IOU to his wife before he got married.

393
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,467
The defendant and his attorney, do you guys

394
00:26:21,587 --> 00:26:23,288
have anything to say about the dispute in question?

395
00:26:24,205 --> 00:26:25,956
As it happened many years ago,

396
00:26:26,254 --> 00:26:28,334
my client cannot remember the details.

397
00:26:28,415 --> 00:26:30,724
Please tell the other party to show us the original document.

398
00:26:31,597 --> 00:26:32,717
Your Honor, I'm sorry.

399
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:34,268
We lost the original document.

400
00:26:40,216 --> 00:26:41,336
Madam, it's fine.

401
00:26:41,461 --> 00:26:42,891
We have plenty of evidence.

402
00:26:45,977 --> 00:26:47,058
Your Honor,

403
00:26:47,232 --> 00:26:48,432
I didn't borrow that sum from her.

404
00:26:48,611 --> 00:26:49,937
I've never signed any IOU as well.

405
00:26:50,105 --> 00:26:51,616
I didn't owe her any money.

406
00:26:51,837 --> 00:26:52,960
You old fool!

407
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:54,669
You wish to welch on your debt now?

408
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,522
You're full of crap!

409
00:26:57,578 --> 00:27:00,408
My family was richer than yours before we got married.

410
00:27:00,489 --> 00:27:02,362
Do you know that you only made money

411
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:04,707
after you married into our family?

412
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:06,030
Silence!

413
00:27:06,111 --> 00:27:08,018
Do you know how much of my money you spent?

414
00:27:08,098 --> 00:27:10,378
You want to welch your debt? No way in hell!

415
00:27:10,458 --> 00:27:11,887
You're not allowed to speak without permission!

416
00:27:11,977 --> 00:27:13,218
- Plaintiff, return to your seat!   - Madam!

417
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,808
Don't touch me!

418
00:27:34,127 --> 00:27:38,007
Your junior is truly unlucky to get a client like her.

419
00:27:38,088 --> 00:27:39,578
Why are you dragging me? I'm innocent!

420
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:40,744
She's such a drag.

421
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:43,216
Why are you guys arresting me?

422
00:27:43,297 --> 00:27:44,498
Comrade, please calm down.

423
00:27:44,578 --> 00:27:45,798
Sorry about that.

424
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,560
I'm innocent!

425
00:27:49,641 --> 00:27:50,990
Madam Wu, calm down.

426
00:27:51,939 --> 00:27:54,497
How can I calm down?

427
00:27:54,617 --> 00:27:56,206
There are rules you must obey in the court.

428
00:27:56,572 --> 00:27:58,189
Going against them won't help you resolve your issues.

429
00:27:58,358 --> 00:28:00,028
The trial has begun.

430
00:28:00,938 --> 00:28:03,140
If we stop now, it'll be detrimental to us.

431
00:28:03,221 --> 00:28:04,858
It's all because of you.

432
00:28:04,939 --> 00:28:06,858
You lost my main piece of evidence!

433
00:28:06,984 --> 00:28:08,693
But we still have other pieces of evidence.

434
00:28:10,068 --> 00:28:11,389
I organized the evidence myself.

435
00:28:11,472 --> 00:28:12,981
I know each of them very well.

436
00:28:14,257 --> 00:28:15,697
The trial has begun.

437
00:28:15,855 --> 00:28:17,602
I'm sure you don't want to lose to your ex-husband, right?

438
00:28:18,326 --> 00:28:21,122
I can't take back my money now!

439
00:28:22,287 --> 00:28:24,438
That scum!

440
00:28:41,769 --> 00:28:44,243
Your Honor, my client has calmed down.

441
00:28:44,324 --> 00:28:45,497
We're ready.

442
00:28:45,648 --> 00:28:49,122
We've submitted a copy of the original IOU. Please take a look.

443
00:28:49,965 --> 00:28:53,069
We think that your evidence was forged.

444
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,540
It lacks legal validity.

445
00:28:57,767 --> 00:28:59,522
This is the plaintiff's bank transaction record.

446
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:02,457
The cash flow, time, amount, and recipient of the record

447
00:29:02,537 --> 00:29:04,878
match the information on the IOU copy.

448
00:29:05,254 --> 00:29:08,618
That's Wu Jie returning the money she borrowed from my client.

449
00:29:08,752 --> 00:29:10,009
She didn't lend the money to him.

450
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:12,182
We've confirmed the proof of borrowing for the loan.

451
00:29:12,263 --> 00:29:13,873
Since you're making a claim

452
00:29:13,982 --> 00:29:17,909
that the plaintiff was the one returning the money to the defendant,

453
00:29:18,086 --> 00:29:20,546
please show us proof of the transaction.

454
00:29:21,775 --> 00:29:24,086
He gave her cash back then.

455
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:25,616
It was 100,000 yuan in cash.

456
00:29:25,766 --> 00:29:28,498
Your Honor, his attorney only expresses a verbal statement

457
00:29:28,617 --> 00:29:29,731
without showing any substantial proof.

458
00:29:29,812 --> 00:29:31,002
However, our evidence copy

459
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:33,325
and the various confirmations have formed a strong evidence chain.

460
00:29:33,406 --> 00:29:34,750
It proves that the defendant borrowed 100,000 yuan

461
00:29:34,831 --> 00:29:36,322
from the plaintiff before their marriage.

462
00:29:38,338 --> 00:29:41,008
Plaintiff, please submit the original evidence

463
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,468
to the court.

464
00:29:51,398 --> 00:29:52,485
Court is adjourned for now.

465
00:29:52,581 --> 00:29:54,531
The collegiate bench will proceed with the panel discussion.

466
00:30:06,582 --> 00:30:07,623
The trial will be resumed.

467
00:30:07,743 --> 00:30:11,122
Regarding the claim that the plaintiff had made toward the defendant

468
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,217
related to the 100,000 yuan IOU before marriage,

469
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:16,381
the plaintiff submitted a copy of the original evidence

470
00:30:16,616 --> 00:30:18,498
and its bank transaction record.

471
00:30:18,579 --> 00:30:20,842
Both pieces of evidence confirm the validity of the claim.

472
00:30:20,923 --> 00:30:23,740
And, the transaction happened before the marriage.

473
00:30:23,821 --> 00:30:25,578
We will acknowledge the claim.

474
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,927
The verdict is as below.

475
00:30:37,744 --> 00:30:40,562
Your junior is pretty good.

476
00:30:40,712 --> 00:30:42,142
Don't you know who her mentor is?

477
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,870
Madam Wu, we won.

478
00:30:46,968 --> 00:30:50,089
It's all because I kept the bank transaction records.

479
00:30:50,287 --> 00:30:51,516
If not,

480
00:30:51,807 --> 00:30:54,158
I won't get back the 100,000 yuan.

481
00:30:54,376 --> 00:30:56,360
I can only depend on myself during crucial moments.

482
00:30:56,493 --> 00:30:58,962
Attorneys like you all are practically useless.

483
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:01,814
I'm sorry. This time, it was my negligence.

484
00:31:03,353 --> 00:31:04,635
Enough.

485
00:31:04,716 --> 00:31:06,467
I need to go back and pack my things.

486
00:31:07,737 --> 00:31:09,456
These are the receipts for the rides I took.

487
00:31:09,537 --> 00:31:11,778
I asked the cab driver for a few more.

488
00:31:11,923 --> 00:31:13,498
The law firm will get reimbursed for this, right?

489
00:31:13,578 --> 00:31:14,897
Submit it to your law firm for me.

490
00:31:14,977 --> 00:31:16,578
I'll give you the receipts for my ride home later.

491
00:31:16,697 --> 00:31:17,926
Include them for me.

492
00:31:18,392 --> 00:31:19,612
No problem.

493
00:31:20,157 --> 00:31:21,787
Don't forget to give me the money.

494
00:31:26,457 --> 00:31:27,677
Cheng Yao,

495
00:31:27,818 --> 00:31:29,682
you shouldn't allow someone like her to get her way.

496
00:31:30,737 --> 00:31:33,162
It's fine. I live nearby.

497
00:31:33,321 --> 00:31:34,722
I can't finish my reimbursement quota anyway.

498
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:36,922
You can go and meet your client. I'll take a break.

499
00:31:37,807 --> 00:31:39,317
Congratulations, Lawyer Cheng.

500
00:31:51,961 --> 00:31:53,181
Cheng Yao.

501
00:31:53,776 --> 00:31:56,297
- Yao Yao.   - Senior, Lawyer Li.

502
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:57,926
You must be exhausted. Have a drink.

503
00:31:58,864 --> 00:32:01,374
Thanks. How much is it? I'll transfer the money to you.

504
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:03,962
Don't mention money in front of me.

505
00:32:04,287 --> 00:32:07,085
It reminds me of Qian Heng.

506
00:32:07,946 --> 00:32:10,225
Bei Qing won quite a few cases before this.

507
00:32:10,306 --> 00:32:11,577
He was doing great

508
00:32:11,752 --> 00:32:13,261
until he encountered Qian Heng.

509
00:32:13,488 --> 00:32:14,838
He never won a case against him.

510
00:32:17,297 --> 00:32:19,878
I think any lawyer who encounters him is unlucky.

511
00:32:20,144 --> 00:32:21,364
It's not just me.

512
00:32:22,017 --> 00:32:23,098
It's the same for Cheng Yao.

513
00:32:23,276 --> 00:32:24,738
The evidence vanished for no apparent reason.

514
00:32:24,849 --> 00:32:26,599
And, the client was so troublesome to deal with.

515
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,110
The vanishing evidence has nothing to do with Qian Heng.

516
00:32:29,497 --> 00:32:31,039
It was my own negligence.

517
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,088
- Maybe...   - Maybe you're not meant to be a lawyer?

518
00:32:34,456 --> 00:32:35,965
Listen, you're meant to be a lawyer.

519
00:32:36,198 --> 00:32:38,106
Qian Heng likes to deny other people's achievements.

520
00:32:38,187 --> 00:32:40,976
Due to that, the people around him will think that they're incompetent.

521
00:32:41,151 --> 00:32:42,647
I'm different from Qian Heng.

522
00:32:42,847 --> 00:32:45,177
I think you did great in that case.

523
00:32:45,378 --> 00:32:47,568
You were calm and collected. You have a bright future ahead of you.

524
00:32:47,807 --> 00:32:50,347
If you had enough of Qian Heng, you can join Jincheng & Co.

525
00:32:50,455 --> 00:32:53,032
Although we don't earn as much as Junheng & Co,

526
00:32:53,215 --> 00:32:56,044
our founding partners are definitely friendlier.

527
00:32:58,956 --> 00:33:01,608
You should consider it too. Maybe you can do better here.

528
00:33:18,762 --> 00:33:21,562
(Li Cheng Xuan)

529
00:33:22,297 --> 00:33:24,717
Li Cheng Xuan? Did you encounter him this afternoon?

530
00:33:25,495 --> 00:33:28,137
It's no wonder he kept praising in the sector's group chat.

531
00:33:28,268 --> 00:33:30,862
He said your case was the calmest counterattack

532
00:33:30,943 --> 00:33:33,515
he has ever witnessed.

533
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,417
You're exaggerating it.

534
00:33:35,497 --> 00:33:37,098
It's just a minor case.

535
00:33:37,285 --> 00:33:40,198
Wu Jie's a client that you'll only encounter once in a lifetime.

536
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:41,562
You think this is a minor case?

537
00:33:41,952 --> 00:33:44,032
All right. At least we won't need to see her again.

538
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,657
What about this? I'll organize a gathering tonight.

539
00:33:46,783 --> 00:33:48,924
We'll hold a celebration and wash away your bad luck.

540
00:33:49,418 --> 00:33:50,638
Sure.

541
00:33:51,261 --> 00:33:53,098
What kind of people are they?

542
00:33:53,178 --> 00:33:54,657
What kind of lousy law firm is this?

543
00:33:54,745 --> 00:33:56,034
There's nothing else I can say.

544
00:33:56,115 --> 00:33:57,646
What a terrible law firm!

545
00:33:57,727 --> 00:33:59,042
All of you, get out of the way!

546
00:33:59,175 --> 00:34:00,697
This is such a terrible law firm!

547
00:34:00,777 --> 00:34:02,122
There's nothing else to say about it!

548
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,537
There's nothing else to say!

549
00:34:03,729 --> 00:34:05,042
There's nothing else to say!

550
00:34:05,136 --> 00:34:07,258
- How dare you guys open a law firm?   - Cheng Yao!

551
00:34:07,456 --> 00:34:09,338
- What kind of people are they?   - Madam Wu.

552
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:10,739
Let's talk in the meeting room, okay?

553
00:34:10,819 --> 00:34:12,859
Don't call me that. Don't try to be close to me.

554
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,537
- How long has she been here?   - Why should I go to the meeting room?

555
00:34:14,617 --> 00:34:16,956
I'll speak here. I want everyone to be my judge.

556
00:34:17,112 --> 00:34:18,442
This is the person.

557
00:34:18,526 --> 00:34:22,287
She lost the most important piece of evidence, which is my IOU.

558
00:34:22,368 --> 00:34:23,672
She threw it away.

559
00:34:23,753 --> 00:34:26,297
Even so, she wants to charge me for her services.

560
00:34:26,378 --> 00:34:27,556
How do you wish to deal with this, then?

561
00:34:27,637 --> 00:34:29,708
Of course it's not to charge me for anything.

562
00:34:30,497 --> 00:34:32,757
Madam Wu,

563
00:34:33,094 --> 00:34:34,935
I apologize once again for losing your IOU.

564
00:34:35,026 --> 00:34:37,097
However, not charging you the attorney fee isn't what we do here.

565
00:34:37,177 --> 00:34:38,305
Listen up.

566
00:34:38,386 --> 00:34:39,875
Not only do you need to waive the attorney fee for me,

567
00:34:39,956 --> 00:34:42,662
but you also have to pay me for mental compensation.

568
00:34:42,964 --> 00:34:45,094
But I've already done my best to fight for your biggest interest.

569
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,430
And, according to the law,

570
00:34:46,511 --> 00:34:47,766
lawyers only have to compensate their clients

571
00:34:47,847 --> 00:34:49,658
if they practice illegal conducts

572
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,150
that lead to the client's loss.

573
00:34:52,936 --> 00:34:54,975
Don't try to scare me.

574
00:34:55,097 --> 00:34:56,445
I've been around for a long time.

575
00:34:56,526 --> 00:34:58,218
You won't scare me with that.

576
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:00,402
I have nothing to say to you.

577
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,470
Go and bring your boss here.

578
00:35:04,621 --> 00:35:06,541
- Madam Wu...   - Don't touch me.

579
00:35:06,645 --> 00:35:08,196
I don't want you touching me.

580
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:13,565
- Get lost!   - Madam Wu, I can call the cops on you for doing so.

581
00:35:13,729 --> 00:35:15,496
If you have any opinions regarding our services,

582
00:35:15,577 --> 00:35:17,097
you can file a complaint at the Law Association or file a lawsuit.

583
00:35:17,177 --> 00:35:19,078
You're welcome to do so. But if you try to default your payment like this,

584
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:20,351
we'll definitely file a lawsuit against you.

585
00:35:20,432 --> 00:35:21,641
Who are you?

586
00:35:21,722 --> 00:35:24,338
What gives you the right to talk to me like that?

587
00:35:24,542 --> 00:35:26,522
- Are you her boss?   - Is someone looking for me?

588
00:35:31,528 --> 00:35:32,748
Hello.

589
00:35:35,017 --> 00:35:36,258
You must be her boss.

590
00:35:36,398 --> 00:35:38,227
Yes, I'm Cheng Yao's boss.

591
00:35:38,308 --> 00:35:39,738
If you have any opinions, you can tell me.

592
00:35:39,857 --> 00:35:42,406
All right, I'll tell you, then.

593
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,202
(Tan Ying)

594
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:54,639
- Tan Ying?   - (Lawyer Wu, this is an emergency.)

595
00:35:54,737 --> 00:35:56,338
Come back and deal with the old lady, which is your forte,

596
00:35:56,441 --> 00:35:58,111
so that we can still win the Golden Scale Award.

597
00:35:59,111 --> 00:36:00,682
Got it. I'm coming back now.

598
00:36:06,751 --> 00:36:08,522
She's so bad at her job.

599
00:36:09,151 --> 00:36:12,647
How could I not doubt your law firm?

600
00:36:14,078 --> 00:36:15,799
She lost such an important piece of evidence,

601
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,522
which is my IOU.

602
00:36:18,072 --> 00:36:20,814
Even so, she still wants me to pay for her services?

603
00:36:20,895 --> 00:36:22,708
Guys, be my judge. Does this even make sense?

604
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:24,297
Madam Wu, I understand the situation now.

605
00:36:24,776 --> 00:36:26,455
However, Lawyer Cheng Yao won the lawsuit.

606
00:36:26,615 --> 00:36:28,271
You didn't incur any losses because of her.

607
00:36:28,357 --> 00:36:29,902
Logically speaking, we shouldn't give you any compensation

608
00:36:29,983 --> 00:36:31,892
or refund the attorney fee.

609
00:36:32,911 --> 00:36:35,300
It was our negligence that we lost the IOU.

610
00:36:35,687 --> 00:36:36,998
However, it wasn't Cheng Yao's fault.

611
00:36:37,681 --> 00:36:41,322
It's my fault. As her mentor, I didn't guide her well.

612
00:36:41,568 --> 00:36:43,035
That means Junheng & Co has flaws

613
00:36:43,115 --> 00:36:45,598
when it comes to dealing with evidence.

614
00:36:45,722 --> 00:36:46,722
To express our sincerity,

615
00:36:46,803 --> 00:36:49,642
I shall compensate you for the attorney fee.

616
00:36:50,153 --> 00:36:51,187
Look at her.

617
00:36:51,268 --> 00:36:52,537
A boss is a boss indeed.

618
00:36:52,617 --> 00:36:54,842
The way she speaks is different as well.

619
00:36:54,996 --> 00:36:58,002
Look at how classy she is.

620
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:01,442
Unlike someone else.

621
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:03,073
She looks pretty,

622
00:37:03,167 --> 00:37:04,962
but she's bad at her job.

623
00:37:05,344 --> 00:37:06,962
Please calm down.

624
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:10,362
This young girl is the girlfriend of our founding partner.

625
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:12,638
Please give her a chance to grow.

626
00:37:12,798 --> 00:37:13,882
Zhang,

627
00:37:13,987 --> 00:37:15,964
take Madam Wu to the counter to proceed with the refund.

628
00:37:16,081 --> 00:37:17,837
- Okay.   - Okay.

629
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,708
Thank you, boss.

630
00:37:19,796 --> 00:37:21,802
- All right, I'll follow him.   - Okay.

631
00:37:27,055 --> 00:37:28,055
No wonder.

632
00:37:28,182 --> 00:37:30,977
So, someone got the position by depending on her boyfriend.

633
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:33,178
She even wanted to be one of the executives, huh?

634
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:35,069
It's no wonder she's terrible at her job.

635
00:37:47,418 --> 00:37:48,638
Cheng Yao,

636
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,070
go and get changed.

637
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:52,947
Lawyer Liang,

638
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:55,762
I think you dealt with that situation poorly.

639
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,302
I know. Qian Heng is out on a business trip.

640
00:38:09,383 --> 00:38:10,722
That's why you're not in your best state.

641
00:38:10,858 --> 00:38:12,930
What about this? You should go back and rest first.

642
00:38:13,011 --> 00:38:14,398
We can talk about this later.

643
00:38:14,479 --> 00:38:16,069
This has nothing to do with Lawyer Qian.

644
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,501
I don't understand why you're doing this.

645
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:20,882
I don't think we should refund her for the attorney fee.

646
00:38:21,014 --> 00:38:22,234
We're lawyers.

647
00:38:22,503 --> 00:38:24,583
We work with contracts, pacts, the law, and principles.

648
00:38:24,742 --> 00:38:27,013
We shouldn't back away just because people might cause a ruckus.

649
00:38:28,881 --> 00:38:31,282
But you did lose the original document. You were the person in charge.

650
00:38:31,878 --> 00:38:33,738
I don't want Wu Jie to cause a ruckus in the law firm.

651
00:38:33,917 --> 00:38:37,738
This will affect your reputation and our colleagues from working.

652
00:38:37,972 --> 00:38:39,211
If this issue blows up,

653
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,485
according to the penalty system,

654
00:38:40,566 --> 00:38:41,818
you should be punished.

655
00:38:41,898 --> 00:38:43,118
Fine.

656
00:38:43,457 --> 00:38:45,282
I'll bear the responsibility for my mistake.

657
00:38:45,912 --> 00:38:47,653
However, I don't wish to be forced to admit that it's my mistake

658
00:38:47,734 --> 00:38:49,205
when it's not my fault.

659
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:52,126
And, the original document vanished for no apparent reason.

660
00:38:52,571 --> 00:38:54,812
If you wish to punish me, we should hold an investigation.

661
00:38:54,893 --> 00:38:56,081
Cheng Yao,

662
00:38:56,175 --> 00:38:58,812
if you attribute all of your mistakes to that,

663
00:38:58,893 --> 00:39:01,281
how should I know if you're trying to shirk your responsibilities or not?

664
00:39:01,362 --> 00:39:04,488
We're lawyers. We need to speak with evidence.

665
00:39:11,617 --> 00:39:14,568
An outstanding woman must achieve success by herself.

666
00:39:14,792 --> 00:39:16,088
An outstanding man

667
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:19,230
won't stay with a decorative figure forever, you know?

668
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:22,478
Here, take this.

669
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:28,366
Lawyer Wu, you're finally here.

670
00:39:33,029 --> 00:39:34,249
What's going on?

671
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:35,858
What's with the huge commotion?

672
00:39:38,938 --> 00:39:40,767
I met Zhang downstairs.

673
00:39:41,111 --> 00:39:43,031
He said you guys already refunded Wu Jie with the attorney fee.

674
00:39:43,229 --> 00:39:44,234
Lawyer Wu.

675
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:47,351
Lawyer Liang forked out her money to clean up the mess Cheng Yao made.

676
00:39:47,432 --> 00:39:50,298
But Cheng Yao didn't appreciate her favor. She wanted to cause trouble too.

677
00:39:50,408 --> 00:39:51,768
Will you die if you just shut up?

678
00:39:51,896 --> 00:39:53,642
- I...   - Fine, I got it.

679
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:55,057
I'll deal with this.

680
00:39:55,183 --> 00:39:56,403
You guys are dismissed.

681
00:39:58,298 --> 00:39:59,518
Lawyer Liang, thanks.

682
00:40:02,418 --> 00:40:03,638
Cheng Yao,

683
00:40:04,738 --> 00:40:06,242
I'll bring you back to get changed.

684
00:40:08,738 --> 00:40:09,897
Let's go.

685
00:40:10,047 --> 00:40:11,479
It's great to be a decorative figure like her.

686
00:40:11,631 --> 00:40:13,042
Even Lawyer Wu is siding with her.

687
00:40:24,024 --> 00:40:26,094
If you're that free, go and find someone to clean the mess.

688
00:40:32,977 --> 00:40:34,197
Proceed with your work.

689
00:40:36,776 --> 00:40:39,285
Remember, do not spread gossip.

690
00:41:03,446 --> 00:41:05,362
(Liang Yi Ran)

691
00:41:06,218 --> 00:41:07,438
Come in.

692
00:41:07,791 --> 00:41:09,399
- You're not busy, aren't you?   - Nope.

693
00:41:09,487 --> 00:41:11,282
- Let's have a chat.   - Sure.

694
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,242
Have you done with your work?

695
00:41:13,977 --> 00:41:15,658
Were you too strict with Cheng Yao?

696
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:17,486
Has she calmed down?

697
00:41:17,636 --> 00:41:19,358
She looked pretty agitated just now.

698
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,218
I heard from the other colleagues

699
00:41:21,298 --> 00:41:23,367
that you were the one who exempted the attorney fee for Wu Jie.

700
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:26,320
I'm a member of Junheng & Co after all.

701
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:29,598
To me, protecting the team comes before the firm's profit.

702
00:41:30,535 --> 00:41:31,755
That's right.

703
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,408
Regarding this mistake, I'll issue a penalty notice.

704
00:41:37,047 --> 00:41:38,506
I hope you can give us an account for this matter

705
00:41:38,587 --> 00:41:41,462
on the founding partners' meeting next time.

706
00:41:42,776 --> 00:41:43,996
Senior,

707
00:41:44,104 --> 00:41:45,402
what do you mean by this?

708
00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:46,909
Did I do the wrong thing by helping her out?

709
00:41:48,546 --> 00:41:51,137
Junheng & Co has never exempted anyone from their attorney fee.

710
00:41:51,273 --> 00:41:52,642
By doing so,

711
00:41:53,072 --> 00:41:54,943
you're telling the others

712
00:41:55,689 --> 00:41:57,002
that it's Cheng Yao's fault.

713
00:41:57,269 --> 00:41:58,270
As one of the founding partners,

714
00:41:58,359 --> 00:42:00,926
I cannot allow the law firm to set such a precedent.

715
00:42:01,368 --> 00:42:04,108
And, I won't allow people to misunderstand our colleague like this.

716
00:42:05,784 --> 00:42:06,943
I heard

717
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:09,554
that you were on good terms with Cheng Yao's sister in private.

718
00:42:09,664 --> 00:42:12,287
As a founding partner, I don't think you should be biased.

719
00:42:16,657 --> 00:42:19,528
I never talked about fighting for Cheng Yao's interest.

720
00:42:22,617 --> 00:42:23,837
Yi Ran,

721
00:42:24,231 --> 00:42:27,741
Qian Heng and I recruited you because of your ability.

722
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:30,622
I hope you won't make me regret my decision

723
00:42:31,277 --> 00:42:33,322
because of your personal issues, okay?

724
00:43:03,898 --> 00:43:05,042
Come in.

725
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:08,922
Cheng Yao? Have a seat.

726
00:43:13,177 --> 00:43:14,397
Coffee or tea?

727
00:43:15,057 --> 00:43:16,277
No thanks.

728
00:43:27,017 --> 00:43:28,482
Here, have some coffee.

729
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,860
What's wrong?

730
00:43:31,647 --> 00:43:33,202
I'm sorry about Wu Jie's case.

731
00:43:33,487 --> 00:43:34,958
It was all my fault.

732
00:43:36,296 --> 00:43:37,602
I'll resign as soon as possible.
