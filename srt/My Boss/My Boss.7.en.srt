1
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:38,762
(My Boss)

2
00:01:40,538 --> 00:01:42,241
(Episode 7: I asked you to keep a distance from the client)

3
00:01:42,265 --> 00:01:43,765
(not because I was afraid you'd mess up the case, )

4
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:45,562
(but that I wanted you to protect yourself.)

5
00:01:49,256 --> 00:01:51,936
Mr. Xu hopes to reach a settlement out of court.

6
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,960
This agreement is enough to prove our sincerity.

7
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,402
Furthermore, Miss Bai

8
00:01:55,631 --> 00:01:57,331
- is a celebrity in the entertainment industry. - Yes.

9
00:01:57,355 --> 00:01:59,698
Once the litigation process starts, she will be exposed to gossip.

10
00:01:59,722 --> 00:02:01,442
This is probably not a good thing

11
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,100
for her image.

12
00:02:04,853 --> 00:02:05,921
Perfect.

13
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,460
Really perfect.

14
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,470
Unfortunately, I don't accept it.

15
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,562
Lawyer Qian,

16
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,007
did you consult your client before refusing to accept it?

17
00:02:20,243 --> 00:02:22,576
Without communicating with your client,

18
00:02:22,657 --> 00:02:26,362
you rejected our settlement proposal for your own benefit.

19
00:02:26,928 --> 00:02:29,802
I refuse to accept this settlement agreement because I know

20
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,720
it is not the best settlement proposal.

21
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,220
You can offer more.

22
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,625
Mr. Xu, your company is in the key period of going public.

23
00:02:37,742 --> 00:02:40,282
How will a lawsuit affect an IPO? You should be very clear.

24
00:02:40,485 --> 00:02:43,839
After the IPO, your assets will fold multiple times.

25
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,960
Compared to that, the settlement amount you offered to your ex-wife

26
00:02:47,057 --> 00:02:48,338
is peanuts.

27
00:02:48,508 --> 00:02:50,737
So, who will benefit more from signing

28
00:02:50,817 --> 00:02:52,017
the settlement agreement?

29
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:53,962
Think it through and then come talk to me.

30
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,642
Let's talk again next time.

31
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,322
Thank you, Lawyer Qian.

32
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,990
Let's get together again.

33
00:03:17,777 --> 00:03:18,882
Goodbye.

34
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:26,967
Boss. We reject it before communicating with Bai Xing Meng.

35
00:03:27,057 --> 00:03:28,357
Is that acceptable?

36
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,058
Will there be any problems?

37
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,040
Before meeting them, I have already communicated with Bai Xing Meng.

38
00:03:34,193 --> 00:03:35,432
She doesn't accept the settlement,

39
00:03:35,456 --> 00:03:37,776
no matter what kind of settlement conditions Xu Jun gives.

40
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,664
Then, why did you still let Xu Jun go back and think again

41
00:03:40,745 --> 00:03:42,295
for a better solution?

42
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,602
In order to give them hope for a settlement.

43
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,442
Are you deliberately confusing them so they won't focus on preparing for

44
00:03:53,772 --> 00:03:57,002
- the lawsuit? - Do you think I can only win by confusing others?

45
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,480
No need for so many whys. This is what Bai Xing Meng wants.

46
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,119
As a lawyer, you just need to do what needs to be done

47
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,520
and don't try to probe into the inner world of the client.

48
00:04:08,492 --> 00:04:10,442
Also, I need to remind you

49
00:04:10,952 --> 00:04:12,256
not to be unprofessional with the case

50
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,857
just because you have a private relationship

51
00:04:13,881 --> 00:04:15,641
or feel good about the other party's lawyer.

52
00:04:16,538 --> 00:04:17,679
No such thing!

53
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,920
Do you think I didn't see you guys exchanging glances?

54
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:23,202
Boss, you misunderstood.

55
00:04:23,351 --> 00:04:25,434
He, Gu Bei Qing, is my senior in college.

56
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,269
When he was a first-year graduate student, I was a freshman.

57
00:04:27,293 --> 00:04:30,717
It was under his guidance that I passed my judicial exam.

58
00:04:31,116 --> 00:04:33,078
Later, he graduated and left the country.

59
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,879
We haven't been in contact for a long time.

60
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,519
Today is the first time we met after he returned.

61
00:04:37,607 --> 00:04:38,907
Believe me.

62
00:04:40,606 --> 00:04:42,362
It's not what you think.

63
00:04:43,906 --> 00:04:47,597
I promise. I won't affect my work because of personal relationships.

64
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,880
What score did you get on the judicial exam?

65
00:04:52,948 --> 00:04:55,482
Just passing the passing score line.

66
00:04:56,499 --> 00:04:58,257
Oh, so he tutored you on the judicial exam

67
00:04:58,337 --> 00:04:59,378
just to get such a result?

68
00:04:59,497 --> 00:05:00,797
His level is too poor.

69
00:05:03,162 --> 00:05:06,011
It must be because I cooked last night and disturbed you.

70
00:05:06,092 --> 00:05:07,722
So, you deliberately targeted me.

71
00:05:08,417 --> 00:05:09,726
You can do it tonight.

72
00:05:12,826 --> 00:05:14,762
- What are you doing? - I...

73
00:05:15,757 --> 00:05:17,056
I'm thinking about the menu for tonight.

74
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,380
What do you want to eat, boss?

75
00:05:18,768 --> 00:05:20,068
Focus on the work.

76
00:05:21,753 --> 00:05:23,053
Focus on the work?

77
00:05:24,088 --> 00:05:25,882
Cheng Xi. What are you doing here?

78
00:05:26,036 --> 00:05:27,121
Yao Yao.

79
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:30,079
My college friend had an accident. She's in another city.

80
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,616
And, there's no one to take care of her. I have to rush over.

81
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,162
- Take care of Wei Zhen Tian for a few days. - Me?

82
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,075
- I... But... - Take this.

83
00:05:37,156 --> 00:05:39,740
- But... - I have to catch the high-speed train. I'm in a hurry.

84
00:05:39,764 --> 00:05:41,704
- Please help. - But I...

85
00:05:42,351 --> 00:05:43,981
Don't forget to feed it.

86
00:06:02,646 --> 00:06:03,997
It's so cute.

87
00:06:08,164 --> 00:06:11,202
When the boss returns, you must not bark. Okay?

88
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,469
What's your name?

89
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:15,150
Wei Zhen Tian.

90
00:06:16,074 --> 00:06:17,202
Wei Zhen Tian.

91
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,682
Don't bark, no matter what. Don't bark.

92
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,082
Boss, you're back.

93
00:06:40,507 --> 00:06:42,177
Why does it smell like a dog is in here?

94
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:43,398
Really?

95
00:06:43,499 --> 00:06:45,589
It might be because I've just eaten stinky tofu.

96
00:06:46,601 --> 00:06:48,030
Don't eat stinky tofu at home.

97
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,469
This puppy is so cute.

98
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,080
Actually, I have always liked puppies.

99
00:06:53,161 --> 00:06:55,442
They are cute, lively, and affectionate.

100
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,720
Most importantly, they are man's best friends.

101
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,423
The relationship between dogs and humans

102
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:02,134
can be traced back thousands of years.

103
00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:05,771
This is the accessory that my client's daughter put here today.

104
00:07:07,753 --> 00:07:10,072
Don't assume I like dogs just because I have a dog-shaped accessory.

105
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,682
Having a dog at home is absolutely not allowed. Give up on that.

106
00:07:12,751 --> 00:07:15,042
Why? Dogs are man's best friend.

107
00:07:15,622 --> 00:07:17,742
There can be a dog without you, or you without a dog.

108
00:07:31,378 --> 00:07:33,115
Wei Zhen Tian, look.

109
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,242
This is your good friend, Ba Tian Hu.

110
00:07:37,442 --> 00:07:40,577
I'm telling you, if you want to stay here, you must never bark.

111
00:07:40,664 --> 00:07:41,722
Understood?

112
00:07:51,928 --> 00:07:53,278
Cheng Yao, what are you doing?

113
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,042
I'm learning how to bark.

114
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,060
Are you crazy?

115
00:08:05,337 --> 00:08:08,007
Don't bark. Otherwise, you'll be kicked out.

116
00:08:20,526 --> 00:08:21,826
No barking.

117
00:08:27,324 --> 00:08:28,522
Don't bark.

118
00:08:31,657 --> 00:08:34,847
- Boss. - Cheng Yao, I hope you don't make any strange noises.

119
00:08:41,537 --> 00:08:43,687
What... What is this?

120
00:08:44,413 --> 00:08:45,551
A dog.

121
00:08:45,688 --> 00:08:49,288
I know it's a dog. I mean how did it get here?

122
00:08:51,691 --> 00:08:53,282
Boss, are you afraid of dogs?

123
00:08:53,608 --> 00:08:54,800
Don't worry about it.

124
00:08:54,898 --> 00:08:57,282
Just move it away from me. Hurry up!

125
00:08:59,478 --> 00:09:01,002
Just move it away.

126
00:09:05,918 --> 00:09:07,638
Today, immediately, right away.

127
00:09:07,761 --> 00:09:08,922
Get it away from me.

128
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,000
Don't do it, boss.

129
00:09:11,103 --> 00:09:12,279
It's my sister's dog.

130
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,943
My sister is on a business trip. She wanted to leave it here for a while.

131
00:09:14,967 --> 00:09:16,898
Don't worry. I'll keep it in the room

132
00:09:16,978 --> 00:09:19,298
- and it won't come out to bother you. - No way.

133
00:09:19,534 --> 00:09:22,082
If you keep it, your year-end bonus will be gone for sure.

134
00:09:23,713 --> 00:09:25,401
Boss, think it through carefully.

135
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,212
Actually, there are many benefits to keeping a dog.

136
00:09:27,236 --> 00:09:30,042
For example, dogs are the most loyal friends of humans.

137
00:09:30,165 --> 00:09:32,325
They provide emotional value to humans.

138
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,400
And, since we sit in the office for a long time,

139
00:09:34,605 --> 00:09:37,235
taking the dog out for a walk can also be a way to exercise.

140
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:39,522
Keep your ability to argue for the court.

141
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:41,433
I said no pets. So, that's a no. You need to step back.

142
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:44,198
That doesn't mean just because you're the boss...

143
00:09:46,031 --> 00:09:49,460
I already said it. It will stay in the room and not disturb you.

144
00:09:50,567 --> 00:09:53,647
Plus, I make supper and dinner for you every day.

145
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,762
It takes a lot of time and energy.

146
00:09:55,863 --> 00:09:57,362
Isn't it to pay me back?

147
00:09:57,991 --> 00:10:00,322
Hasn't that cured your insomnia as well?

148
00:10:02,216 --> 00:10:03,602
I've read the document.

149
00:10:04,123 --> 00:10:07,655
You took a case from a psychologist with only five million as the target.

150
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:10,271
That doesn't fit your usual standards for taking cases.

151
00:10:10,462 --> 00:10:11,727
There must be something abnormal.

152
00:10:11,751 --> 00:10:12,882
Are you investigating me?

153
00:10:13,289 --> 00:10:14,699
I'm also a party involved, right?

154
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,322
I have the right to know, right?

155
00:10:17,028 --> 00:10:20,109
No matter who it is, they would be suspicious of this situation.

156
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,107
Boss, even psychologists can't cure your insomnia but I did.

157
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,778
Can you please take that into account and let the dog stay?

158
00:10:27,944 --> 00:10:30,504
Cheng Yao, don't decide things on your own.

159
00:10:30,643 --> 00:10:31,799
Don't act clever either.

160
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,882
Investigating without permission is a privacy violation. Take it away.

161
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,470
Why are you so mad?

162
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:42,519
If I don't get to the bottom of this,

163
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,203
won't I be exploited by you until there's nothing left of me?

164
00:11:12,289 --> 00:11:13,362
Forget it.

165
00:11:13,978 --> 00:11:15,577
This special skill

166
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,860
may get me extra points in the law firm's assessment.

167
00:11:57,699 --> 00:11:59,162
(Dogs can't go to the living room.)

168
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,560
Don't run. Cheng Yao. Don't worry.

169
00:12:32,657 --> 00:12:33,802
The boss isn't here.

170
00:12:34,201 --> 00:12:36,616
He had something urgent to do this morning, and he went to the airport.

171
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,720
That's good.

172
00:12:37,813 --> 00:12:39,484
I didn't want to see him so early either.

173
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,000
Actually, there's another reason.

174
00:12:42,098 --> 00:12:43,377
He knows you're late.

175
00:12:43,487 --> 00:12:44,546
So, being late by half an hour

176
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,450
isn't much different from being late for a day.

177
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,339
He came to find you early this morning but found you weren't here.

178
00:12:48,363 --> 00:12:49,962
So, he left you a note.

179
00:12:53,017 --> 00:12:54,977
(Bai Xing Meng will be visiting. Receive her.)

180
00:12:55,136 --> 00:12:57,976
(You are docked for full attendance bonus for being late this morning.)

181
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,700
Lawyer Cheng.

182
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:07,362
Can you help me?

183
00:13:09,069 --> 00:13:10,722
What's wrong, Miss Bai?

184
00:13:12,655 --> 00:13:13,922
Xu Jun

185
00:13:15,202 --> 00:13:17,042
knows I don't agree to the settlement.

186
00:13:17,123 --> 00:13:18,528
He sent someone to come to my door,

187
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:20,255
threatening and intimidating me,

188
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,520
making me agree to a settlement.

189
00:13:22,641 --> 00:13:24,522
I don't know what to do.

190
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,202
He asked me how much money I need. You know that.

191
00:13:27,646 --> 00:13:29,282
I'm filing a lawsuit at this point

192
00:13:29,614 --> 00:13:31,162
not to extort.

193
00:13:31,342 --> 00:13:33,002
I'm just asking for one thing, justice.

194
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,882
I want a fair judgment from the court.

195
00:13:35,055 --> 00:13:36,355
I understand.

196
00:13:36,826 --> 00:13:38,729
By the way, threatening and intimidating is illegal.

197
00:13:38,753 --> 00:13:40,053
Did you report it to the police?

198
00:13:40,262 --> 00:13:41,322
No.

199
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,522
I'm scared.

200
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,829
I don't want to go back to the past.

201
00:13:49,193 --> 00:13:51,742
Before we divorced, he was like this.

202
00:13:51,862 --> 00:13:53,613
If it didn't go his way,

203
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,654
he would keep grinding me down, forcing me, until I agreed.

204
00:13:58,116 --> 00:13:59,906
That's why I'm asking you for help

205
00:14:00,225 --> 00:14:02,385
because I've gone through so much pain

206
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,357
to get out of this painful past.

207
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:06,402
I don't want to go back to the way it was.

208
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:09,095
Lawyer Cheng,

209
00:14:09,447 --> 00:14:11,357
can you help me out?

210
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,700
Can I give him your contact information?

211
00:14:14,999 --> 00:14:17,406
Miss Bai. I really want to help you.

212
00:14:17,569 --> 00:14:21,058
But, I'm not high enough in rank to communicate with them directly.

213
00:14:21,138 --> 00:14:24,282
You may still need to find Lawyer Qian. Sorry.

214
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,898
If asking Lawyer Qian is useful, I would've done that.

215
00:14:27,978 --> 00:14:29,956
He said he's only responsible for matters

216
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:31,113
within the scope of legal services.

217
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:34,087
He won't deal with other things that waste his time.

218
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,800
You don't have to make decisions for me.

219
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,560
It has nothing to do with the case either.

220
00:14:39,584 --> 00:14:42,242
It's just that I don't have the courage to face him again.

221
00:14:42,717 --> 00:14:44,162
He's very manipulative

222
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:45,602
and he will follow me.

223
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,818
These days, I can't even shoot my scenes.

224
00:14:47,996 --> 00:14:50,396
I'm afraid that if I turn around, he will appear on the set.

225
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,440
So please, Lawyer Cheng.

226
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:56,658
Be the middleman, express my attitude

227
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:58,629
and make my intention clear.

228
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,193
For other matters, let's just wait for the court's verdict quietly.

229
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:03,722
Is that okay?

230
00:15:07,385 --> 00:15:08,562
Okay.

231
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,322
Thank you.

232
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:13,866
Let me send him your phone number.

233
00:15:20,105 --> 00:15:21,414
I sent it.

234
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,802
Please.

235
00:15:24,979 --> 00:15:26,409
Here he comes.

236
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:30,482
(Hello, Lawyer Cheng.)

237
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,631
(My ex-wife said I just need to contact you directly.)

238
00:15:36,297 --> 00:15:38,577
(She said as long as it's with your consent, )

239
00:15:38,658 --> 00:15:40,762
(she will agree to talk about)

240
00:15:41,223 --> 00:15:42,682
withdrawing the lawsuit with me.

241
00:15:46,591 --> 00:15:49,002
Mr. Xu. Just say what you have to say.

242
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,002
I really have great sincerity.

243
00:15:52,662 --> 00:15:54,322
(In this marriage, )

244
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,482
(I do have my own problems.)

245
00:15:57,297 --> 00:15:59,553
(I focused too much on my career, which led to our current...)

246
00:15:59,577 --> 00:16:02,418
Mr. Xu. Saying all this won't do you any good.

247
00:16:02,536 --> 00:16:04,682
Let's just leave everything to the law.

248
00:16:05,281 --> 00:16:08,242
I hope you don't disturb my client again.

249
00:16:08,405 --> 00:16:10,263
And, don't threaten or intimidate her.

250
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,423
I...

251
00:16:11,607 --> 00:16:12,898
I never threatened her.

252
00:16:13,024 --> 00:16:14,482
(I never did.)

253
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:22,602
Let's wait for the legal ruling. Goodbye.

254
00:16:27,602 --> 00:16:28,616
Thank you.

255
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:30,207
Thank you, Lawyer Cheng.

256
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,484
Otherwise, I really wouldn't know what to do.

257
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,171
It's okay. It will all be all right, Miss Bai.

258
00:16:38,616 --> 00:16:39,916
I believe in you.

259
00:16:46,321 --> 00:16:47,442
Lawyer Cheng.

260
00:16:47,669 --> 00:16:48,740
Hello.

261
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,991
I'm begging you,

262
00:16:52,183 --> 00:16:53,362
Can you

263
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,242
let me meet my ex-wife?

264
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,736
It's really urgent.

265
00:16:57,817 --> 00:17:00,058
I really hope we can sit down face-to-face

266
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:02,383
so we can figure out the current situation.

267
00:17:02,778 --> 00:17:05,048
Mr. Xu, I've said all I need to say.

268
00:17:05,336 --> 00:17:06,762
- Sorry. - Wait.

269
00:17:07,451 --> 00:17:09,918
Is it really that hard for you to arrange a meeting for us?

270
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,883
I'm going home. If there's anything,

271
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:14,736
let's talk about it during working hours.

272
00:17:19,357 --> 00:17:21,748
Lawyer Cheng, can you listen to me for a moment?

273
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:23,708
- Mr. Xu, what do you want? - Can you listen?

274
00:17:23,732 --> 00:17:25,279
Mr. Xu, what do you want to do?

275
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,962
I admit it. I shouldn't have emptied out the assets during the divorce.

276
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,882
In this marriage, I do have some responsibility.

277
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,920
But Bai Xing Meng also has some responsibility too, all right?

278
00:17:35,732 --> 00:17:37,800
I just hope we both can sit down

279
00:17:37,881 --> 00:17:39,441
and talk openly and honestly.

280
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:41,007
Let's both take a step back.

281
00:17:41,089 --> 00:17:43,308
There's no need to push me into a dead end.

282
00:17:43,852 --> 00:17:45,482
Mr. Xu, calm down.

283
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,031
Plus, things have already come to this point.

284
00:17:48,055 --> 00:17:49,922
Why are you still blaming Miss Bai?

285
00:17:50,341 --> 00:17:53,522
You should go back and think about what you did wrong.

286
00:17:53,984 --> 00:17:56,344
Don't follow me anymore. Otherwise, I'm calling the police.

287
00:18:20,371 --> 00:18:22,282
What's going on?

288
00:18:22,403 --> 00:18:24,202
It looks like someone jumped off a building.

289
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:26,716
Let's go. This is scary.

290
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,282
What's the situation on the scene?

291
00:18:28,747 --> 00:18:30,642
I'm not too sure. When I saw him,

292
00:18:30,723 --> 00:18:33,575
he had already jumped down from there.

293
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,050
Do you know him?

294
00:18:36,393 --> 00:18:37,602
No.

295
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,713
(Xu Jun, the CEO of Tuantuan Online, )

296
00:19:09,737 --> 00:19:12,177
(jumped to his death from the headquarters building earlier.)

297
00:19:12,247 --> 00:19:14,882
(The following is the Weibo he posted before committing suicide.)

298
00:19:15,677 --> 00:19:18,218
("I started from nothing and founded Tuantuan Online.)

299
00:19:18,298 --> 00:19:21,018
(Just before the listing, I encountered a lawsuit from my ex-wife.)

300
00:19:21,098 --> 00:19:22,536
(There was no way to settle.)

301
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:25,042
(My hard work was destroyed in an instant.)

302
00:19:25,138 --> 00:19:27,510
(My marriage with my ex-wife is full of painful memories.)

303
00:19:27,591 --> 00:19:30,738
(And, some people deliberately criticized me publicly.)

304
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:34,458
(These false rumors completely distorted my image.)

305
00:19:34,538 --> 00:19:37,962
(The defamation online has made many friends)

306
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:39,163
(doubt my character.)

307
00:19:39,298 --> 00:19:41,762
(My reputation plummeted to the bottom.)

308
00:19:41,843 --> 00:19:44,744
(The overwhelming insults were incessant.)

309
00:19:44,825 --> 00:19:46,893
(And, the last straw that broke me)

310
00:19:46,974 --> 00:19:49,842
(was that someone with malicious intent informed my investors)

311
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:53,496
(of the potential lawsuit that could not be settled.)

312
00:19:53,577 --> 00:19:56,137
(One by one, investors requested to withdraw their investments.)

313
00:19:56,217 --> 00:19:58,137
(Tuantuan Online had no hope of going public, )

314
00:19:58,217 --> 00:20:00,611
(while my competitors had smooth sailing.")

315
00:20:00,692 --> 00:20:01,953
I just heard the gossip yesterday.

316
00:20:01,977 --> 00:20:04,466
It turns out Xu Jun and Bai Xing Meng were really married.

317
00:20:04,552 --> 00:20:08,010
Before I fully understood the situation, I saw Xu Jun's suicide note.

318
00:20:08,091 --> 00:20:09,162
Yeah.

319
00:20:09,325 --> 00:20:11,606
Yesterday, the whole web was cursing Xu Jun as a scumbag.

320
00:20:11,657 --> 00:20:13,337
Now that Xu Jun is dead,

321
00:20:13,417 --> 00:20:16,486
his suicide note implies Bai Xing Meng is not that innocent either.

322
00:20:16,567 --> 00:20:18,778
He said he was tricked into marriage by Bai Xing Meng.

323
00:20:18,863 --> 00:20:22,127
But Bai Xing Meng looks so innocent.

324
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,356
She doesn't seem like she would do something like this.

325
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,439
It's hard to say.

326
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,281
What's real or fake in the entertainment industry isn't so clear cut.

327
00:20:28,737 --> 00:20:30,037
The bus is here.

328
00:20:54,098 --> 00:20:56,522
(Yao Yao. Hurry up and tell me what's going on.)

329
00:20:56,581 --> 00:20:58,137
(Why did Xu Jun die?)

330
00:20:58,217 --> 00:21:00,018
He's too fragile.

331
00:21:00,098 --> 00:21:01,877
It's just that the company couldn't go public!

332
00:21:01,901 --> 00:21:03,299
He even tried to tarnish Bai Xing Meng's name.

333
00:21:03,323 --> 00:21:05,722
Bai Xing Meng is really pitiful.

334
00:21:06,076 --> 00:21:07,562
Ting Ting, let's discuss this later.

335
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,088
(Sorry, the number you've dialed)

336
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:30,018
(cannot be reached at the moment.)

337
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,737
(Sorry, the number you've dialed)

338
00:21:34,818 --> 00:21:37,007
(cannot be reached at the moment.)

339
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,366
Let me tell you.

340
00:21:40,447 --> 00:21:41,997
About the case of Bai Xing Meng...

341
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,830
What happened to them, Tan Ying?

342
00:22:00,123 --> 00:22:02,738
Bai Xing Meng has found Deng Ming to be her lawyer.

343
00:22:02,935 --> 00:22:04,442
They just held a press conference.

344
00:22:07,888 --> 00:22:09,556
(May I ask if Mr. Xu Jun's suicide)

345
00:22:09,637 --> 00:22:12,162
(was related to Miss Bai's lawsuit for divorce?)

346
00:22:14,576 --> 00:22:16,842
Miss Bai Xing Meng sued Xu Jun

347
00:22:17,111 --> 00:22:19,402
for re-division of assets after divorce

348
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:22,563
out of Miss Bai Xing Meng's defense of her legal rights

349
00:22:22,648 --> 00:22:24,310
and interests in matrimonial assets.

350
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,621
Miss Bai Xing Meng, in accordance with the principle of parting as friends,

351
00:22:27,702 --> 00:22:29,101
accepted the settlement.

352
00:22:29,197 --> 00:22:31,377
However, out of trust in professionals,

353
00:22:31,572 --> 00:22:33,686
Miss Bai entrusted all communication matters

354
00:22:33,767 --> 00:22:36,687
to the professional lawyers at Junheng & Co.

355
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:40,362
Miss Bai has never communicated directly with Mr. Xu Jun.

356
00:22:40,642 --> 00:22:41,679
Nonetheless,

357
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,520
due to the lawyers' negligence in informing,

358
00:22:43,579 --> 00:22:45,311
Miss Bai Xing Meng didn't know

359
00:22:45,392 --> 00:22:46,704
that Mr. Xu had requested to communicate

360
00:22:46,728 --> 00:22:49,042
with Miss Bai multiple times before.

361
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,602
We are deeply saddened by the tragedy

362
00:22:53,887 --> 00:22:55,876
(caused by this.)

363
00:22:56,507 --> 00:22:58,202
Wait. How can he say that?

364
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:01,287
It was she who cried and asked me to communicate with Mr. Xu.

365
00:23:02,139 --> 00:23:04,242
How can she now put all the blame on Junheng?

366
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:07,202
This must be a strategy Deng Ming set for her.

367
00:23:07,384 --> 00:23:08,829
He's the best at manipulating public opinion.

368
00:23:08,853 --> 00:23:12,241
(What you mean is Mr. Xu Jun's death was largely caused)

369
00:23:12,322 --> 00:23:14,202
by Junheng & Co?

370
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,322
Miss Bai, how will you handle this matter?

371
00:23:18,118 --> 00:23:21,417
Regarding the false accusations Mr. Xu Jun made on Weibo,

372
00:23:21,611 --> 00:23:23,562
out of humanitarianism,

373
00:23:23,681 --> 00:23:27,778
Miss Bai Xing Meng decided to withdraw the lawsuit against him.

374
00:23:28,016 --> 00:23:31,137
But, for certain media, self-media, marketing accounts

375
00:23:31,217 --> 00:23:34,722
which distorted and fabricated facts, as well as spread rumors,

376
00:23:34,805 --> 00:23:35,833
and defamed her,

377
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,097
we will resolutely pursue their legal responsibility.

378
00:23:38,243 --> 00:23:41,458
As for Junheng & Co's failure to fulfill its duties,

379
00:23:41,538 --> 00:23:44,882
(Miss Bai will terminate the agency agreement according to law)

380
00:23:44,977 --> 00:23:47,337
(and reserve the right to pursue its legal responsibility.)

381
00:23:47,414 --> 00:23:50,253
(Her subsequent legal matters will be entrusted to Dewei & Co, )

382
00:23:50,334 --> 00:23:52,322
(which means I will act as her agent.)

383
00:23:54,497 --> 00:23:56,523
All right, don't watch anymore.

384
00:23:56,688 --> 00:23:57,922
Don't make yourself too upset.

385
00:23:59,742 --> 00:24:01,162
You should be careful too.

386
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,031
Qian Heng will be back from court soon.

387
00:24:03,055 --> 00:24:05,055
Think about how you're going to explain it to him.

388
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:07,258
I made such a big mistake.

389
00:24:07,338 --> 00:24:08,722
How am I going to explain it?

390
00:24:08,815 --> 00:24:10,322
Don't be so down.

391
00:24:10,744 --> 00:24:12,344
Deng Ming has hired his internet armies.

392
00:24:12,483 --> 00:24:14,793
We can do the same. Right?

393
00:24:15,007 --> 00:24:16,784
He's still not good enough to fight us.

394
00:24:17,031 --> 00:24:19,431
I'm going to contact the media now to do something about it.

395
00:24:35,504 --> 00:24:36,882
Lawyer Wu.

396
00:24:38,365 --> 00:24:39,402
What's wrong?

397
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,498
In terms of public relations, everyone trusts you a lot.

398
00:24:43,522 --> 00:24:45,225
But, when something like this happens, usually,

399
00:24:45,249 --> 00:24:47,249
Lawyer Qian will surely fire Cheng Yao right away.

400
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,740
Think of ways to deal with it.

401
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,162
Okay. I'll think of something. Let me think.

402
00:25:11,629 --> 00:25:13,882
Have something sweet to adjust your mood.

403
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,151
Believe in Lawyer Wu's public relations skills.

404
00:25:16,454 --> 00:25:17,882
Thank you, Tan Ying.

405
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,100
This is the material that Lawyer Qian mentioned. Send it to me.

406
00:25:25,254 --> 00:25:26,778
Has Lawyer Qian come back?

407
00:25:26,894 --> 00:25:28,047
Lawyer Qian is still in court.

408
00:25:28,071 --> 00:25:30,111
He asked me to come back and send her the material.

409
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:31,738
Is there any way to contact him?

410
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,349
When Lawyer Qian is in court, his phone is always turned off.

411
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:40,789
What should we do now?

412
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:43,122
It's all my fault.

413
00:25:43,237 --> 00:25:44,906
I caused trouble again.

414
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,461
To be precise, it's not entirely your fault. It's only half your fault.

415
00:25:49,707 --> 00:25:51,608
Stop being so meticulous about everything. okay?

416
00:25:51,632 --> 00:25:52,932
It's not the time to say this.

417
00:25:54,175 --> 00:25:55,475
I'll keep working.

418
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:57,558
Cheng Yao, that's not what he meant.

419
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,642
It's not all your fault. Think about it.

420
00:26:00,776 --> 00:26:03,456
Bai Xing Meng's acting is highly praised by everyone.

421
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:07,964
We can't just sit here and do nothing.

422
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,941
There must be a way.

423
00:26:10,417 --> 00:26:11,497
So, what do you want to do?

424
00:26:11,544 --> 00:26:13,759
You can't force Bai Xing Meng to apologize, right?

425
00:26:14,093 --> 00:26:15,213
Just eat something sweet

426
00:26:15,293 --> 00:26:16,593
and calm down.

427
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,592
- Where are you going? - To look for Bai Xing Meng.

428
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,682
Cheng Yao.

429
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,080
Miss Bai.

430
00:26:53,177 --> 00:26:55,105
It was you who asked me to communicate with Xu Jun.

431
00:26:55,129 --> 00:26:57,329
Why are you now shifting the responsibility to Junheng?

432
00:26:57,996 --> 00:26:59,556
I don't know what you're talking about.

433
00:27:01,966 --> 00:27:03,886
What do you mean?

434
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,042
What are you doing?

435
00:27:05,898 --> 00:27:07,687
Can you not cause unnecessary trouble here?

436
00:27:08,432 --> 00:27:09,444
I'm not causing trouble.

437
00:27:09,525 --> 00:27:11,245
Miss Bai. I hope you can clarify the facts.

438
00:27:11,306 --> 00:27:13,002
- Miss Bai. - What facts?

439
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,962
Are you saying

440
00:27:19,674 --> 00:27:21,315
you privately negotiated with Xu Jun

441
00:27:21,396 --> 00:27:23,146
according to Miss Bai's instructions?

442
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,640
All right. When Miss Bai informed you,

443
00:27:25,721 --> 00:27:27,402
did she send you a text or email?

444
00:27:27,932 --> 00:27:29,402
She verbally asked me to do that.

445
00:27:29,597 --> 00:27:30,836
Was there a recording?

446
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,082
Was there?

447
00:27:32,832 --> 00:27:33,842
No?

448
00:27:36,424 --> 00:27:39,064
So, regarding the "facts" you're referring to, can I understand it as

449
00:27:39,088 --> 00:27:40,361
you not wanting to take responsibility

450
00:27:40,385 --> 00:27:42,158
for the mistake you made by neglecting your duty

451
00:27:42,182 --> 00:27:43,522
and then coming up with a way

452
00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:45,376
- to frame my client as the culprit? - I didn't.

453
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,593
Provide evidence then to prove that my client was aware of your multiple

454
00:27:48,674 --> 00:27:50,567
malicious obstructions against Xu Jun's effort to communicate with her.

455
00:27:50,591 --> 00:27:52,122
I didn't obstruct maliciously.

456
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,318
I didn't! Miss Bai, say something.

457
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,202
Miss Bai, get in the car and rest first. I'll take care of this.

458
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,340
Let go.

459
00:28:07,082 --> 00:28:09,962
Yao Yao, let me tell you. Your brother-in-law is trying to help you.

460
00:28:10,043 --> 00:28:11,282
You're not my brother-in-law.

461
00:28:12,768 --> 00:28:14,336
Fine. Your ex-brother-in-law then.

462
00:28:14,586 --> 00:28:16,322
I was trying to help you.

463
00:28:17,002 --> 00:28:18,608
Didn't I just tell you?

464
00:28:18,917 --> 00:28:20,602
I said you should provide evidence.

465
00:28:20,862 --> 00:28:23,897
Providing evidence is the way to solve this. Right?

466
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,456
But, you can't provide any evidence.

467
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,482
All right?

468
00:28:28,618 --> 00:28:31,722
Okay. Yao Yao. Don't blame yourself too much.

469
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:36,682
I believe Xu Jun's death was definitely not because of you. Okay?

470
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,040
But, your behavior did make him desperate.

471
00:28:41,395 --> 00:28:43,224
You drove him to a dead end.

472
00:28:43,635 --> 00:28:45,496
That's your dereliction of duty. Is that right?

473
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,962
Cheng Yao is my employee.

474
00:28:47,179 --> 00:28:49,659
You don't have the right to accuse her of dereliction of duty.

475
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,791
Hey, isn't this Lawyer Qian?

476
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,402
We haven't seen each other in a long time.

477
00:28:56,885 --> 00:28:58,760
I've been wanting to contact you

478
00:28:58,956 --> 00:29:01,282
about the Golden Scale Award this year.

479
00:29:01,377 --> 00:29:04,118
I luckily won against you again by just a little bit.

480
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:07,642
I feel sorry for letting you accompany me in the race.

481
00:29:08,018 --> 00:29:10,002
So, I want to invite you to dinner.

482
00:29:10,127 --> 00:29:13,456
But you see, I've been doing shows and interviews lately.

483
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,802
I'm really busy.

484
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,540
Or how about this? Let's have a meal together these two days.

485
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:21,282
No need. If I were you,

486
00:29:21,363 --> 00:29:23,203
I wouldn't be thinking about eating right now.

487
00:29:23,245 --> 00:29:26,377
Rather, I'd return home earlier and look up the law.

488
00:29:26,457 --> 00:29:29,017
After all, you haven't won against me even once all these years.

489
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,300
Right.

490
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,202
Lawyer Qian, you have always been my role model.

491
00:29:36,402 --> 00:29:38,482
I'm trying my best to catch up from behind.

492
00:29:39,397 --> 00:29:40,562
Deng Ming.

493
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,002
Don't do any more tricks.

494
00:30:06,563 --> 00:30:08,042
Tricks?

495
00:30:09,364 --> 00:30:10,964
That's a really rustic way of saying it.

496
00:30:17,866 --> 00:30:20,082
Sorry, Miss Bai. It's been a while.

497
00:30:26,544 --> 00:30:28,254
You'd better not mess with Qian Heng.

498
00:30:28,822 --> 00:30:30,292
Don't complicate things.

499
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,362
Just handle the matter with Xu Jun.

500
00:30:35,757 --> 00:30:37,362
Get me out of this mess.

501
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:40,562
Don't worry.

502
00:30:41,796 --> 00:30:43,402
I still have a backup plan.

503
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:14,624
Do you especially like the feeling of being embarrassed?

504
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,601
I'm really stupid.

505
00:31:19,743 --> 00:31:21,132
Boss, please scold me.

506
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:25,109
My time is precious.

507
00:31:25,192 --> 00:31:28,152
If I have the time to scold you, I might as well take on a few more cases.

508
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,282
Get off.

509
00:31:42,569 --> 00:31:44,042
So, what's going on?

510
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,520
I didn't try to stop Xu Jun from meeting Bai Xing Meng.

511
00:31:47,702 --> 00:31:49,482
It was Bai Xing Meng's own request.

512
00:31:50,148 --> 00:31:52,213
I felt from the beginning that she was too miserable in the marriage.

513
00:31:52,237 --> 00:31:53,547
So, I wanted to help her.

514
00:31:54,017 --> 00:31:56,297
I reminded you not to get too close to your client.

515
00:31:56,601 --> 00:31:58,698
You are just a lawyer. She is just your client.

516
00:31:58,848 --> 00:32:01,129
Nobody asked you to be so open and kind with your client.

517
00:32:02,773 --> 00:32:05,320
Sorry, boss. I've tarnished Junheng's name.

518
00:32:05,408 --> 00:32:07,488
If you don't want to see me, I can leave right away.

519
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,950
Making such a big mess and wanting to leave just like that?

520
00:32:12,476 --> 00:32:14,421
I did something wrong. I'm willing to pay damages.

521
00:32:14,445 --> 00:32:15,682
Can you afford it?

522
00:32:16,591 --> 00:32:18,271
So, boss, what do you want me to do?

523
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:20,060
I'll listen to whatever you say.

524
00:32:21,164 --> 00:32:22,464
What do you think?

525
00:32:23,339 --> 00:32:24,602
I'm willing.

526
00:32:25,842 --> 00:32:28,069
- Willing to do what? - I'm willing to do whatever you ask me to do

527
00:32:28,093 --> 00:32:29,402
and be your assistant for life.

528
00:32:29,967 --> 00:32:32,402
Cheng Yao, what kind of grudge do you have against me?

529
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:37,410
All right. Let's talk about the case first.

530
00:32:37,612 --> 00:32:38,912
What did you do wrong?

531
00:32:40,054 --> 00:32:41,721
I was wrong to not listen to you

532
00:32:41,802 --> 00:32:43,471
and keeping a distance from the client.

533
00:32:44,327 --> 00:32:47,560
I shouldn't have been emotional and done irrational things at work.

534
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,224
That's it?

535
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,440
Oh, and

536
00:32:54,726 --> 00:32:57,202
I should've caused trouble with such a good boss around.

537
00:32:57,348 --> 00:32:59,202
I've pried into your privacy.

538
00:32:59,788 --> 00:33:00,882
Anything else?

539
00:33:01,793 --> 00:33:03,562
I can't think of anything else.

540
00:33:03,955 --> 00:33:05,882
Could it be because I have a dog?

541
00:33:07,499 --> 00:33:10,151
You said everything you did was all Bai Xing Meng's orders.

542
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:11,824
I really doubt it.

543
00:33:12,058 --> 00:33:13,937
Is it really not your own decision?

544
00:33:14,329 --> 00:33:16,042
Boss, don't you trust me?

545
00:33:16,804 --> 00:33:18,912
Nowadays, many lawyers have their own interests when handling cases.

546
00:33:18,936 --> 00:33:20,218
They profit from both parties.

547
00:33:20,445 --> 00:33:22,546
For example, you persuade Bai Xing Meng not to meet Xu Jun in person

548
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:23,858
and at the same time, contact Xu Jun

549
00:33:23,882 --> 00:33:25,442
to request a fee for doing him a favor.

550
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:28,983
After taking the money, you facilitate a settlement between both parties.

551
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,538
Originally, it was a win-win situation and nobody would know.

552
00:33:31,835 --> 00:33:33,718
Unfortunately, Xu Jun has poor psychological resilience.

553
00:33:33,742 --> 00:33:35,033
You made a mistake. He committed suicide.

554
00:33:35,057 --> 00:33:37,562
I didn't. I'm not that kind of person.

555
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:41,402
Boss, I promise I absolutely didn't make a penny from it.

556
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:42,522
Evidence?

557
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:47,722
I don't have any.

558
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,152
But boss, you're so smart.

559
00:33:52,493 --> 00:33:54,122
You'll definitely find out the truth.

560
00:33:55,382 --> 00:33:56,840
If you are willing,

561
00:33:56,921 --> 00:33:59,761
I'm willing to sign a contract with you, giving you a lifetime of work.

562
00:34:00,374 --> 00:34:01,734
And now, you even want to scam me?

563
00:34:04,607 --> 00:34:06,682
Now then, do you know what you did wrong?

564
00:34:11,012 --> 00:34:13,122
I asked you to keep a distance from the client

565
00:34:13,816 --> 00:34:15,664
not because I was afraid you would mess up the case,

566
00:34:15,688 --> 00:34:17,969
but because I wanted you to know how to protect yourself.

567
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,079
Being a lawyer has its own professional risks.

568
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,350
It's not enough to rely on enthusiasm and passion.

569
00:34:24,148 --> 00:34:25,413
Many lawyers in public welfare and rights protection cases

570
00:34:25,437 --> 00:34:28,191
ended up suspending their own licenses and going to prison.

571
00:34:28,338 --> 00:34:30,578
You need to learn to identify which clients carry risks.

572
00:34:30,658 --> 00:34:32,778
Keep these risks within a controllable range.

573
00:34:32,859 --> 00:34:34,714
Keep the evidence in the process of representation.

574
00:34:34,738 --> 00:34:37,322
Cheng Yao, you are a lawyer,

575
00:34:37,663 --> 00:34:39,498
so you should know where the boundaries of the law are

576
00:34:39,522 --> 00:34:40,962
and how to operate safely.

577
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,882
Take this lesson. Then, taking this case is not too bad for you.

578
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:51,606
Boss. Without evidence, why are you willing to help me?

579
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,470
I believe in you.

580
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,802
Why?

581
00:34:57,412 --> 00:34:59,052
Because you're not smart enough for this.

582
00:35:05,298 --> 00:35:07,298
As long as you have enough intelligence, I'm good.

583
00:35:08,016 --> 00:35:10,002
I still need to learn more from you, boss.

584
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:13,364
All right. Keep business and private matters separate.

585
00:35:13,388 --> 00:35:14,472
Regarding the lawyer fees for Bai Xing Meng's case,

586
00:35:14,496 --> 00:35:15,736
I'll collect every penny.

587
00:35:16,516 --> 00:35:19,487
In this world, there's nothing I can't solve.

588
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:43,362
For today's dinner, it's all fresh seafood. Please try it.

589
00:35:46,927 --> 00:35:49,166
Would it be better to drizzle some lemon juice

590
00:35:49,255 --> 00:35:50,975
on these oysters to remove the fishy smell?

591
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,362
I'll improve next time.

592
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,679
I like to have this cuttlefish grilled.

593
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,042
Then, I'll go buy an oven.

594
00:36:03,491 --> 00:36:05,721
The shell of the mantis shrimp is quite sharp.

595
00:36:06,405 --> 00:36:07,755
Let me help you peel it.

596
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,029
You worked extra hard today to pay off the debt.

597
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:19,613
Boss. Today's dinner is specially prepared to thank you.

598
00:36:19,701 --> 00:36:21,172
No need to include it in the bill.

599
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,082
Thank you, boss.

600
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,000
Thank you for taking the time

601
00:36:28,081 --> 00:36:29,681
to lay out the facts and reason with me.

602
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,062
Thank you for encouraging me.

603
00:36:33,645 --> 00:36:34,984
True friendship is revealed during hardship.

604
00:36:35,008 --> 00:36:36,968
You are now a monument on my life's journey,

605
00:36:37,057 --> 00:36:38,416
guiding me in the direction ahead.

606
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,482
Wait a minute.

607
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,391
Where did you copy this from?

608
00:36:42,298 --> 00:36:45,078
These are all my most genuine thoughts.

609
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,111
Oh, right, boss.

610
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,414
What do you like me to sing when I'm cooking?

611
00:36:53,615 --> 00:36:55,362
Give me a song list and I'll learn them.

612
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,280
I just have occasional insomnia. It's not like I'm always having it.

613
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,974
Even so, I should always be prepared.

614
00:37:02,071 --> 00:37:03,371
I can't be lazy.

615
00:37:06,661 --> 00:37:08,349
Okay. Since you're so sincere,

616
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,338
you should write a 10,000-word self-reflection report.

617
00:37:10,362 --> 00:37:11,400
That many words?

618
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,700
Handwritten. No plagiarism rate higher than 10%.

619
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,562
And, don't think that I'll let you off just because I ate your seafood.

620
00:37:18,763 --> 00:37:21,362
Mistakes at work should be punished accordingly.

621
00:37:22,755 --> 00:37:24,678
But, let's talk about these after I finish dealing with Bai Xing Meng.

622
00:37:24,702 --> 00:37:25,842
Let's eat.

623
00:37:28,047 --> 00:37:29,410
Boss, the shrimp is ready.

624
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,700
I just hope we can sit down and talk honestly and openly.

625
00:38:01,801 --> 00:38:03,151
Let's each take a step back.

626
00:38:03,488 --> 00:38:05,442
There's no need to push me into a dead end.

627
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,346
He came to me that day. Was he already out of options?

628
00:38:12,554 --> 00:38:14,842
Xu Jun's death definitely wasn't caused by you.

629
00:38:15,078 --> 00:38:18,718
But, your actions did make him desperate.

630
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,830
You made him go out of options.

631
00:38:21,255 --> 00:38:23,082
That's your dereliction of duty, right?

632
00:39:07,682 --> 00:39:10,322
(Weibo's notice: Xu Jun's family accepts interview, confirming...)

633
00:39:12,121 --> 00:39:14,819
(I'm Xu Jun's brother. Regarding my brother's unfortunate passing, )

634
00:39:14,843 --> 00:39:16,482
(my family and I are shocked.)

635
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:18,377
(We simply couldn't accept it.)

636
00:39:18,457 --> 00:39:21,194
(Actually, at that time, if my brother and his ex-wife Bai Xing Meng)

637
00:39:21,218 --> 00:39:22,282
(had communicated then, )

638
00:39:22,363 --> 00:39:24,309
(there would still be a chance for a settlement.)

639
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:26,522
(My brother wouldn't have been so desperate either.)

640
00:39:26,638 --> 00:39:28,402
(The tragedy wouldn't have happened.)

641
00:39:28,497 --> 00:39:30,678
(Now, I want to ask you, Lawyer Cheng, )

642
00:39:30,942 --> 00:39:32,478
(isn't your conscience affected?)

643
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:33,977
(What have you gained)

644
00:39:34,058 --> 00:39:36,658
(from preventing my brother from communicating with his ex-wife?)

645
00:39:41,517 --> 00:39:42,619
(You are an evil lawyer, )

646
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,473
(like a murderer eating human blood buns, Cheng Yao.)

647
00:39:44,497 --> 00:39:47,247
- (A black-hearted lawyer.) - (She's doing anything for money.)

648
00:39:47,388 --> 00:39:49,332
- (She's ruining lawyers' reputation.) - (She's evil.)

649
00:39:49,356 --> 00:39:50,736
(This person is simply disgusting.)

650
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,174
(I vomited at the sight of such a lawyer.)

651
00:39:52,198 --> 00:39:53,878
(Get out of the legal industry, murderer.)

652
00:40:12,976 --> 00:40:14,082
Hello.

653
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,681
(You murderer!)

654
00:40:15,774 --> 00:40:17,162
(You evil person!)

655
00:40:17,297 --> 00:40:18,442
Cheng Yao.

656
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,420
Don't answer the call anymore.

657
00:40:24,025 --> 00:40:25,922
How could they have my number?

658
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,428
There's no secret in the internet age.

659
00:40:28,975 --> 00:40:30,642
Just do a bit of people search

660
00:40:31,212 --> 00:40:33,162
and all the information will be transparent.

661
00:40:36,282 --> 00:40:37,582
Let's go out together.

662
00:41:06,762 --> 00:41:08,432
What do you need?

663
00:41:13,605 --> 00:41:14,802
I want that.

664
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:19,562
Get her a mocktail. I'll have that.

665
00:41:19,804 --> 00:41:21,104
A moment, please.

666
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,002
But boss, I want to drink alcohol.

667
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:26,039
Your tolerance is too low.

668
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:27,631
After you're drunk, you act strange.

669
00:41:27,784 --> 00:41:29,442
Isn't this a special occasion?

670
00:41:29,586 --> 00:41:31,346
What happened the last time you drank?

671
00:41:31,574 --> 00:41:32,874
Do you need me to remind you?

672
00:41:35,111 --> 00:41:36,672
Then, why not just stay at home?

673
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,162
Why come out?

674
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,362
At home, there's a dog.

675
00:41:51,999 --> 00:41:55,016
I thought you brought me out

676
00:41:55,308 --> 00:41:56,819
to relax and reset myself.

677
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,630
Hah, you're delusional.

678
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,282
Lawyer Qian, Yao Yao.

679
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,082
Senior? What a coincidence!

680
00:42:13,541 --> 00:42:15,091
Lawyer Qian, you invited me here.

681
00:42:15,495 --> 00:42:16,855
Is it because of Yao Yao's matter?

682
00:42:17,262 --> 00:42:19,862
If it weren't for Cheng Yao, would you think I'd want to see you?

683
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:24,918
I came to find you today hoping you tell Cheng Yao

684
00:42:25,096 --> 00:42:27,857
the information you have as Xu Jun's lawyer regarding their marriage.

685
00:42:28,151 --> 00:42:29,202
Of course.

686
00:42:29,283 --> 00:42:31,513
You don't have to mention the confidential parts of the case.

687
00:42:31,537 --> 00:42:33,282
Just analyze it from your own perspective.

688
00:42:39,137 --> 00:42:40,682
Actually, I didn't expect

689
00:42:40,828 --> 00:42:42,348
he couldn't hold on in the end either.

690
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:47,602
Xu Jun has actually been suffering from severe depression for a long time.

691
00:42:48,264 --> 00:42:49,682
He had been relying on medication

692
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:51,709
to barely keep his condition stable.

693
00:42:53,436 --> 00:42:55,722
But, I had no idea that he had depression.

694
00:42:56,504 --> 00:43:00,264
Yao Yao, I know that facing Xu Jun's death, be it about your conscience

695
00:43:00,346 --> 00:43:01,842
or the public opinion,

696
00:43:02,141 --> 00:43:03,682
it's stressful for you.

697
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,760
All these make you feel like it's your fault.

698
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,120
Actually, it's not.

699
00:43:07,301 --> 00:43:08,901
It's all Bai Xing Meng's responsibility.

700
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,300
Bai Xing Meng has always known about Xu Jun's depression.

701
00:43:14,395 --> 00:43:17,178
But, she said she was the victim in this marriage.

702
00:43:17,258 --> 00:43:19,178
Xu Jun coldly insulted and verbally abused her.

703
00:43:19,286 --> 00:43:20,522
He even physically abused her.

704
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:22,141
Has she shown you any evidence?

705
00:43:22,637 --> 00:43:25,298
I have Xu Jun's diagnosis of depression here,

706
00:43:25,518 --> 00:43:27,438
as well as their previous chat records.

707
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,417
When did Bai Xing Meng say

708
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,321
she was a victim of marriage?

709
00:43:31,391 --> 00:43:32,701
How come I didn't know?

710
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,589
There was a time,

711
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:37,658
after a meeting, she met me privately in the conference room

712
00:43:37,793 --> 00:43:39,713
and confirmed the evidence with me. That's when.

713
00:43:39,816 --> 00:43:41,737
No wonder she's a famous actress,

714
00:43:41,957 --> 00:43:44,183
able to twist what's true and false with her acting skills.

715
00:43:44,207 --> 00:43:46,985
The Weibo post Xu Jun posted before his death is true.
