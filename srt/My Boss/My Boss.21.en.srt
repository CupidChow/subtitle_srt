1
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:38,962
(My Boss)

2
00:01:40,034 --> 00:01:41,651
(Episode 21)

3
00:01:41,747 --> 00:01:45,842
(Cheng Yao, he's your boss. Stop imagining things.)

4
00:02:31,923 --> 00:02:34,442
If you have a sore throat, go get some medicine.

5
00:02:36,941 --> 00:02:38,161
Qian.

6
00:02:39,447 --> 00:02:42,198
I understand your love for me and you want to stay with me.

7
00:02:44,736 --> 00:02:46,651
But it's already one o'clock in the morning.

8
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,322
We have to go to work tomorrow.

9
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:50,270
Are you not considering going back earlier?

10
00:02:50,452 --> 00:02:52,082
Don't you often stay up late?

11
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:55,917
My joy of staying up late alone

12
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,595
and looking at your iceberg-like face while drinking here,

13
00:02:58,676 --> 00:02:59,916
can they be the same?

14
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:02,214
Plus, I'm in a really bad mood today.

15
00:03:02,832 --> 00:03:04,101
I want to be alone.

16
00:03:04,432 --> 00:03:05,680
We're both adults.

17
00:03:05,845 --> 00:03:07,098
We need space.

18
00:03:08,052 --> 00:03:09,272
Please leave.

19
00:03:11,127 --> 00:03:12,347
One more glass.

20
00:03:15,498 --> 00:03:18,362
Qian Heng, tell me the truth, did something happen to you?

21
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,928
You've been asking me to drink all night.

22
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,539
Come on, tell me.

23
00:03:24,765 --> 00:03:27,042
I'll help you with anything except lending money.

24
00:03:30,179 --> 00:03:31,579
Do you really want to borrow money?

25
00:03:34,731 --> 00:03:35,951
How much do you need?

26
00:03:37,123 --> 00:03:40,074
No, I have a relationship issue that I want to ask you about.

27
00:03:41,128 --> 00:03:42,348
Relationship issue?

28
00:03:43,516 --> 00:03:44,577
That's it?

29
00:03:46,718 --> 00:03:48,082
Qian.

30
00:03:48,178 --> 00:03:50,819
You've been hesitant to talk about such a small issue all night.

31
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,568
Not me.

32
00:03:53,918 --> 00:03:55,268
It's about a friend of mine.

33
00:03:58,458 --> 00:03:59,678
Your friend?

34
00:04:00,917 --> 00:04:02,466
It's really my friend.

35
00:04:04,194 --> 00:04:06,642
My friend is having some relationship issues.

36
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:08,366
He wanted to ask me about it. But you know

37
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,057
I'm not very good at this either.

38
00:04:10,191 --> 00:04:11,351
So, I wanted to ask you.

39
00:04:11,437 --> 00:04:12,954
After all, you have extensive experience, right?

40
00:04:12,978 --> 00:04:15,082
(You're finally anxious about not getting the girl.)

41
00:04:15,163 --> 00:04:16,842
(It serves you right.)

42
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:18,853
What's so funny?

43
00:04:20,444 --> 00:04:22,263
Nothing. Tell me, I'm all ears.

44
00:04:24,546 --> 00:04:27,759
My friend received a passionate confession from a girl.

45
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:31,496
This girl often works with him.

46
00:04:33,592 --> 00:04:36,482
(Could it be that Liang Yi Ran confessed to Qian Heng again?)

47
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,497
Is your friend also a lawyer by any chance?

48
00:04:39,601 --> 00:04:41,486
What's the matter with you? I already said it's not me.

49
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,962
Not me!

50
00:04:43,946 --> 00:04:45,442
You don't understand human language.

51
00:04:49,568 --> 00:04:50,788
You want to do this?

52
00:04:51,984 --> 00:04:53,833
Important matters should be emphasized four times.

53
00:04:53,857 --> 00:04:55,522
Fine.

54
00:04:55,782 --> 00:04:57,402
It's your friend. Fine.

55
00:04:57,663 --> 00:04:59,057
If he doesn't like her, just reject her.

56
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:01,311
He can't force himself when it comes to feelings.

57
00:05:03,508 --> 00:05:05,191
Well, it's not that he's forced.

58
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:06,791
That means he wants to accept her happily.

59
00:05:06,815 --> 00:05:08,231
I want to interview you then.

60
00:05:08,312 --> 00:05:10,180
If your friend wants to accept her,

61
00:05:10,261 --> 00:05:12,282
what's with your constipated expression?

62
00:05:13,266 --> 00:05:16,071
No, after that girl confessed, there has been no further development.

63
00:05:16,152 --> 00:05:17,372
No matter how much I...

64
00:05:18,946 --> 00:05:21,336
No matter how much my friend tried to hint, she had no reaction at all.

65
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,497
It's as though this never happened.

66
00:05:23,617 --> 00:05:25,482
Her mood was not affected at all.

67
00:05:25,578 --> 00:05:28,442
(Oh my gosh, Liang Yi Ran has progressed this time.)

68
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,282
(She's playing hard to get.)

69
00:05:31,938 --> 00:05:35,098
Could it be that when it comes to relationships, your friend is too

70
00:05:35,217 --> 00:05:36,437
stupid?

71
00:05:36,938 --> 00:05:41,078
He sent the wrong message and made the girl feel hopeless.

72
00:05:41,546 --> 00:05:43,975
In that case, she can only treat it as if nothing happened.

73
00:05:45,559 --> 00:05:46,821
That's impossible.

74
00:05:46,969 --> 00:05:49,508
My friend has made it very obvious.

75
00:05:49,623 --> 00:05:51,513
That's just what he thinks.

76
00:05:53,225 --> 00:05:54,394
Qian, let me tell you.

77
00:05:54,475 --> 00:05:57,201
This friend of yours is just too arrogant.

78
00:05:57,575 --> 00:06:02,964
He didn't respond promptly to the girl's feelings, and she felt rejected.

79
00:06:03,202 --> 00:06:05,967
If it were me, I would also regret confessing.

80
00:06:08,147 --> 00:06:09,152
Regret?

81
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:11,105
Why would she regret it? Come on.

82
00:06:11,186 --> 00:06:12,584
Because it hurts her self-esteem,

83
00:06:12,686 --> 00:06:15,397
she feels humiliated, and it's very embarrassing.

84
00:06:18,662 --> 00:06:19,670
So what?

85
00:06:19,751 --> 00:06:23,236
So, the man has to take the initiative to pursue her.

86
00:06:23,448 --> 00:06:24,668
You

87
00:06:27,817 --> 00:06:29,368
tell that friend of yours that

88
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,709
if he's interested in her and has feelings for her,

89
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:35,628
he shouldn't miss the opportunity. Just go for it.

90
00:06:36,577 --> 00:06:37,797
That's impossible.

91
00:06:38,537 --> 00:06:40,840
My friend has a strict rule of not pursuing people.

92
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:43,829
Pursuing people doesn't fit his style.

93
00:06:46,716 --> 00:06:47,936
Okay.

94
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:50,152
Then he should at least

95
00:06:50,582 --> 00:06:53,672
find a more direct way to hint at her.

96
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,199
When the atmosphere is right,

97
00:06:57,801 --> 00:07:00,300
ask your friend to tell the girl that

98
00:07:00,381 --> 00:07:03,413
he reluctantly accepts her confession.

99
00:07:04,522 --> 00:07:05,742
That should work, right?

100
00:07:09,998 --> 00:07:11,216
I'll tell him about it.

101
00:07:16,472 --> 00:07:17,692
Oh my goodness.

102
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:28,249
Hey, has the material for Lawyer Wang been prepared?

103
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,922
The Magic Blade?

104
00:07:34,697 --> 00:07:35,858
Why is it this one?

105
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:37,989
- It's not The Magic Blade. - Turn it off.

106
00:07:39,014 --> 00:07:40,233
Don't fool around during work hours.

107
00:07:40,257 --> 00:07:42,154
- Lawyer Wu. - No.

108
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:45,811
Do you know who recently confessed to Lawyer Qian?

109
00:07:46,662 --> 00:07:48,617
Is she from our firm? Is that true?

110
00:07:48,728 --> 00:07:49,948
Yes.

111
00:07:50,298 --> 00:07:52,177
- Who is it? - Me. I confess every day.

112
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:54,579
I think he's handsome and capable. He's indeed perfect.

113
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:56,087
He's talking about a girl.

114
00:07:56,357 --> 00:07:57,397
A girl?

115
00:07:57,478 --> 00:07:58,909
Do we have such heroin in our firm?

116
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:03,039
Who is it?

117
00:08:03,443 --> 00:08:04,609
I wouldn't have asked you two if I knew.

118
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:05,902
You don't even know about this.

119
00:08:06,121 --> 00:08:07,592
Losers. You're wasting my time.

120
00:08:10,652 --> 00:08:11,872
He knows who it is?

121
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,260
Who knows?

122
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,762
Have you heard of it?

123
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,750
The actress who recently became popular was cheated on by her boyfriend.

124
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,071
It was all over the news.

125
00:08:19,204 --> 00:08:22,428
- She has three words in her name. - I know, I saw the gossip.

126
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:25,177
This woman even said she wouldn't get married.

127
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:26,906
She's advocating singlehood and not going to date.

128
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,842
Was it just an impulsive statement?

129
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,266
It's hard to say. They have been together for seven or eight years.

130
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,490
And they were discussing getting married some time ago.

131
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:37,042
Suddenly, this guy cheated on her, and he's a habitual offender.

132
00:08:37,271 --> 00:08:40,248
She's such a good woman. He doesn't cherish her.

133
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,922
Men are the worst.

134
00:08:44,018 --> 00:08:48,317
No, Yu Fei, say a few words for the majority of male compatriots.

135
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,159
That's an imprecise statement.

136
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,865
Yes, the scope is too broad.

137
00:08:53,258 --> 00:08:54,728
There are plenty of good men.

138
00:08:55,011 --> 00:08:56,371
There's one right in front of you.

139
00:08:57,105 --> 00:08:58,202
Me.

140
00:09:02,311 --> 00:09:04,951
But if I were the female celebrity, I wouldn't get married either.

141
00:09:05,224 --> 00:09:07,318
She's rich and beautiful. She would do great being single.

142
00:09:07,342 --> 00:09:08,962
Yes, the key is...

143
00:09:09,326 --> 00:09:11,058
Let's discuss this case.

144
00:09:11,138 --> 00:09:13,235
- What case? - It's about the case where the boss is around.

145
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:14,479
The boss is around?

146
00:09:15,657 --> 00:09:17,377
That case...

147
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,082
Good morning, boss.

148
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,535
The bidding unit is currently facing asset issues, right?

149
00:09:23,336 --> 00:09:25,376
- Boss. - Lawyer Qian.

150
00:09:27,058 --> 00:09:28,762
It's that...

151
00:09:30,322 --> 00:09:31,431
Which case did you take?

152
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:32,949
That's the one.

153
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,890
Cheng Yao.

154
00:09:40,512 --> 00:09:42,816
The merchant just called me and said they made a mistake this time.

155
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,480
You might have gotten the wrong gift box.

156
00:09:45,513 --> 00:09:48,338
But I already gave it to Lawyer Qian. He didn't say anything.

157
00:09:48,423 --> 00:09:49,643
Didn't say anything?

158
00:09:50,309 --> 00:09:51,389
Has he opened the gift box?

159
00:09:51,502 --> 00:09:52,622
He must have.

160
00:09:52,703 --> 00:09:54,053
It's been so many days.

161
00:09:55,388 --> 00:09:57,656
They sent this batch of gifts to many people, and many were mixed up.

162
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,429
The confession gift box of a rich lady was missing,

163
00:09:59,453 --> 00:10:01,253
so he purposely called me and asked about it.

164
00:10:01,538 --> 00:10:04,298
But perhaps your gift box wasn't within their error range.

165
00:10:04,378 --> 00:10:07,165
Of course, if I had given the confession gift box to Lawyer Qian,

166
00:10:07,246 --> 00:10:09,106
he wouldn't have been so calm.

167
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:12,202
That makes sense. I'm glad it's fine.

168
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,556
It's definitely not the wrong one.

169
00:10:18,489 --> 00:10:21,208
(If he's interested in her and has feelings for her, )

170
00:10:21,473 --> 00:10:22,827
(he shouldn't miss the opportunity.)

171
00:10:22,851 --> 00:10:23,964
Just go for it.

172
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,839
Cheng Yao, come to my office.

173
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,282
Come in.

174
00:10:47,595 --> 00:10:48,815
Boss, you want to see me?

175
00:10:50,337 --> 00:10:51,557
Is there a problem?

176
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,882
I appreciate your gift and thoughts.

177
00:10:58,443 --> 00:11:00,322
Actually, we can discuss it.

178
00:11:02,347 --> 00:11:03,578
Really?

179
00:11:05,473 --> 00:11:06,678
Boss, don't worry.

180
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:08,989
I will work hard to live up to your expectations.

181
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,090
Don't get your hopes up just yet.

182
00:11:13,594 --> 00:11:15,242
I'm still considering it.

183
00:11:16,557 --> 00:11:17,962
It depends on your performance.

184
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:21,242
Don't worry. From now on, I will follow you closely.

185
00:11:21,388 --> 00:11:22,673
I'll follow your instructions diligently.

186
00:11:22,697 --> 00:11:24,246
I won't deviate from the assigned tasks.

187
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,742
I'll always prioritize your needs.

188
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,893
My mission is to make you happy.

189
00:11:29,883 --> 00:11:31,103
Anything else?

190
00:11:32,877 --> 00:11:34,037
And...

191
00:11:34,263 --> 00:11:35,912
And I want to be your right-hand man.

192
00:11:35,993 --> 00:11:38,692
I'll dedicate myself to solving your problems.

193
00:11:44,741 --> 00:11:45,860
Boss.

194
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,396
Can you disclose

195
00:11:49,205 --> 00:11:51,085
how much of a salary increase you're giving me?

196
00:11:52,539 --> 00:11:54,242
Salary increase?

197
00:11:55,223 --> 00:11:57,878
Don't worry. Regardless of the amount, it's a form of recognition from you.

198
00:11:57,902 --> 00:12:00,343
I will continue to work hard and not become arrogant.

199
00:12:00,577 --> 00:12:04,377
After you get a salary increase and make money, what's next?

200
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,282
- Boss. - Get out.

201
00:12:08,097 --> 00:12:10,508
I've looked into the business situation of the company

202
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:11,909
that you asked me to investigate.

203
00:12:12,673 --> 00:12:14,074
Analyze the case for me today.

204
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,523
Send it directly to my villa tomorrow.

205
00:12:15,547 --> 00:12:16,767
I'll send you the password.

206
00:12:18,561 --> 00:12:20,762
Tomorrow? Isn't it a bit of a rush?

207
00:12:20,894 --> 00:12:22,002
You can't finish it?

208
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:25,360
No, it depends on whether you prioritize quality or quantity.

209
00:12:25,527 --> 00:12:26,747
You both go out.

210
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,537
The salary...

211
00:12:28,686 --> 00:12:29,762
Get out.

212
00:12:51,043 --> 00:12:53,327
(The merchant just called me and said they made a mistake this time.)

213
00:12:53,351 --> 00:12:55,071
(You might have gotten the wrong gift box.)

214
00:12:56,015 --> 00:12:58,642
I appreciate your gift and thoughts.

215
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,220
Actually, we can discuss it.

216
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:04,049
(Boss has been acting weird lately.)

217
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,254
(He mentioned the gift just now.)

218
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,598
(Could it be that I sent the wrong gift?)

219
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,760
No way.

220
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,082
Come in.

221
00:13:28,585 --> 00:13:29,805
Anything else?

222
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:36,106
Boss, didn't you just talk about the gift?

223
00:13:36,704 --> 00:13:38,973
Do you like the gift I gave you?

224
00:13:40,932 --> 00:13:42,152
The gift?

225
00:13:43,001 --> 00:13:44,221
Not bad.

226
00:13:50,317 --> 00:13:53,946
About the words on the card, do you think there's any hope for it?

227
00:13:59,113 --> 00:14:01,264
(I love you. I want to have your baby.)

228
00:14:05,004 --> 00:14:07,194
I didn't expect you to be so direct.

229
00:14:09,817 --> 00:14:13,242
You can be more reserved when it comes to expressing your feelings.

230
00:14:28,495 --> 00:14:29,522
Bao.

231
00:14:30,118 --> 00:14:32,518
I'll help you send your information to Lawyer Qian tomorrow.

232
00:14:34,817 --> 00:14:37,045
Really? That's great.

233
00:14:37,147 --> 00:14:38,602
Tomorrow is the weekend.

234
00:14:38,683 --> 00:14:40,562
I need to accompany my girlfriend.

235
00:14:40,778 --> 00:14:41,998
You're doing me a big favor.

236
00:14:48,378 --> 00:14:51,202
(I should go to his villa and see if I sent the wrong gift.)

237
00:15:11,469 --> 00:15:13,939
Is it necessary to put it in such a prominent place?

238
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,416
(I love you. I want to have your baby.)

239
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,930
(So, the boss has been acting weird lately because of this gift.)

240
00:15:26,577 --> 00:15:29,900
(Where is the hole? I want to jump into it and never come out.)

241
00:15:29,986 --> 00:15:31,655
(How did such an awkward situation happen?)

242
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:32,762
Honey.

243
00:15:33,134 --> 00:15:36,407
We didn't even tell our son that we were coming.

244
00:15:36,632 --> 00:15:37,901
This is not good, right?

245
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,141
Wouldn't it be worse if you told him that we're coming?

246
00:15:41,911 --> 00:15:43,131
You don't understand.

247
00:15:49,138 --> 00:15:50,377
This is his study.

248
00:15:50,486 --> 00:15:54,423
It's surely the space where our son stays for the longest time.

249
00:15:54,573 --> 00:15:55,923
It must be here.

250
00:15:56,128 --> 00:15:58,479
Let me see where to put it.

251
00:15:59,577 --> 00:16:01,242
East, south, west...

252
00:16:01,626 --> 00:16:03,167
The west side should be here.

253
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:04,922
Honey, hurry up.

254
00:16:05,993 --> 00:16:07,433
It's just a bouquet of plastic flowers.

255
00:16:07,457 --> 00:16:08,886
Do you have to be so serious about it?

256
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,030
Silly you.

257
00:16:10,115 --> 00:16:12,475
You can't find real peach blossoms in this season.

258
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:13,722
It's just symbolic.

259
00:16:13,861 --> 00:16:15,865
Sincerity works wonders, you know.

260
00:16:15,946 --> 00:16:18,442
Your mind is full of feudal superstitions.

261
00:16:18,605 --> 00:16:20,350
I'm superstitious?

262
00:16:20,431 --> 00:16:22,488
You're trying to look scientific.

263
00:16:22,798 --> 00:16:23,993
Tell me then,

264
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:28,362
do you have any way to make your son start dating and get married sooner?

265
00:16:28,465 --> 00:16:30,242
- Tell me. - I don't have any.

266
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,797
(Even the boss can't escape being pressured to get married.)

267
00:16:32,821 --> 00:16:34,896
Expert advice must be effective.

268
00:16:35,023 --> 00:16:36,632
Shut up, seriously.

269
00:16:37,193 --> 00:16:40,122
The master said that this peach blossom array needs sufficient sunlight.

270
00:16:40,392 --> 00:16:41,608
Why are the curtains closed?

271
00:16:41,694 --> 00:16:43,882
Seriously, I don't want to talk to you.

272
00:16:46,853 --> 00:16:48,802
Madam, be careful.

273
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:50,162
You scared me.

274
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,042
Cheng Yao?

275
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:55,811
What are you doing here?

276
00:16:58,658 --> 00:16:59,878
I...

277
00:17:00,282 --> 00:17:02,793
I'm here to deliver documents to my boss.

278
00:17:02,945 --> 00:17:04,442
Deliver documents?

279
00:17:08,269 --> 00:17:11,088
The documents are so big and heavy.

280
00:17:13,193 --> 00:17:14,242
It's so heavy.

281
00:17:18,261 --> 00:17:19,481
I love you?

282
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,789
I want to have your baby?

283
00:17:36,954 --> 00:17:39,042
Dad, you said you have something urgent, what...

284
00:17:40,508 --> 00:17:41,638
Qian Heng.

285
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,548
Come and sit down. Don't just stand there.

286
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:44,940
Sit next to Cheng Yao.

287
00:17:47,282 --> 00:17:49,680
I was helping Bao deliver the documents.

288
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,279
Then your parent suddenly came in.

289
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,922
I got nervous as they came in, so I hid behind the curtains.

290
00:17:54,202 --> 00:17:56,242
I hid behind the curtain and they misunderstood.

291
00:17:56,641 --> 00:17:57,727
There's no misunderstanding.

292
00:17:57,751 --> 00:17:59,562
Qian Heng, there's no misunderstanding.

293
00:18:00,422 --> 00:18:04,328
Cheng Yao, we were once young. We've been in this situation.

294
00:18:04,485 --> 00:18:05,704
We understand.

295
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,500
Qian Heng, there's no misunderstanding.

296
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,842
I need to use the washroom.

297
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:11,858
Okay, it's over there.

298
00:18:18,754 --> 00:18:20,521
- Come here. - What's wrong?

299
00:18:21,737 --> 00:18:24,962
How long have you two been together?

300
00:18:25,097 --> 00:18:26,327
Who pursued whom?

301
00:18:28,967 --> 00:18:30,518
She pursued me.

302
00:18:31,718 --> 00:18:33,148
She pursued you?

303
00:18:35,074 --> 00:18:38,242
This girl is brave. She's good.

304
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:41,722
How did she confess?

305
00:18:42,766 --> 00:18:44,179
She probably secretly admired me for a long time.

306
00:18:44,203 --> 00:18:45,482
She just never confessed to me.

307
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:48,040
So when she confessed to me, I was not mentally prepared.

308
00:18:50,617 --> 00:18:52,042
Then what?

309
00:18:52,403 --> 00:18:55,114
So, she didn't make any big moves.

310
00:18:55,516 --> 00:18:57,738
Maybe my excellence puts her under some pressure.

311
00:18:57,954 --> 00:18:59,706
So, she adopted the strategy of subtle influence,

312
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,530
hoping for a connection to develop over time.

313
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,758
That's so romantic.

314
00:19:04,848 --> 00:19:06,882
You should learn from her.

315
00:19:08,246 --> 00:19:10,595
How did she subtly influence you?

316
00:19:11,858 --> 00:19:14,858
By making breakfast for me in the morning and cooking dinner at night.

317
00:19:14,969 --> 00:19:17,407
She would fix my water pipes and be available at any time.

318
00:19:17,547 --> 00:19:19,146
I had stomach problems before.

319
00:19:19,227 --> 00:19:20,984
She made porridge for me to nourish my stomach.

320
00:19:21,008 --> 00:19:23,762
When I was on a business trip, she reminded me to eat on time.

321
00:19:24,257 --> 00:19:26,202
She's always very supportive of me.

322
00:19:26,774 --> 00:19:28,019
Everyone says I'm a tumor in the industry,

323
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:29,202
but she doesn't think so.

324
00:19:29,537 --> 00:19:31,137
And we share the same hobbies.

325
00:19:31,217 --> 00:19:33,042
We like the same games and music.

326
00:19:33,227 --> 00:19:34,496
We have many common topics.

327
00:19:36,579 --> 00:19:38,657
Okay, they are progressing well.

328
00:19:38,775 --> 00:19:39,995
Things are moving fast.

329
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,740
So, who confessed in the end?

330
00:19:43,821 --> 00:19:45,508
Has Cheng Yao confessed?

331
00:19:45,589 --> 00:19:46,900
Of course it was her.

332
00:19:47,516 --> 00:19:49,718
She gave me a gift box on my birthday.

333
00:19:49,831 --> 00:19:51,741
There was a note in the gift box.

334
00:19:52,047 --> 00:19:53,717
She wrote about

335
00:19:54,436 --> 00:19:55,866
wanting to have my baby.

336
00:19:58,205 --> 00:19:59,956
There was also a bottle of wine and roses.

337
00:20:00,527 --> 00:20:02,522
Initially, I rejected her,

338
00:20:02,865 --> 00:20:04,494
but she didn't back down.

339
00:20:04,938 --> 00:20:06,329
She continued to stay by my side.

340
00:20:06,457 --> 00:20:09,042
So, I was moved by her persistence.

341
00:20:10,016 --> 00:20:11,193
I decided to give her a chance.

342
00:20:11,217 --> 00:20:12,238
I can give it a try.

343
00:20:13,418 --> 00:20:14,638
Good decision.

344
00:20:19,487 --> 00:20:20,707
Cheng Yao.

345
00:20:21,344 --> 00:20:22,722
I have a gift for you.

346
00:20:22,803 --> 00:20:24,897
- No need to give me a gift. - No.

347
00:20:24,977 --> 00:20:26,969
- This is my... - No...

348
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,250
Madam, this is too valuable.

349
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,510
Not valuable at all.

350
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,402
It's just a sincere blessing to both of you.

351
00:20:33,883 --> 00:20:35,880
Dad, Mom, we need to go now.

352
00:20:35,961 --> 00:20:37,024
Let's go, Cheng Yao.

353
00:20:37,105 --> 00:20:38,656
Go get busy.

354
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:40,382
It's okay, it's just for peace of mind.

355
00:20:41,052 --> 00:20:42,272
Stay safe.

356
00:20:44,749 --> 00:20:46,842
Our son is good.

357
00:20:47,352 --> 00:20:48,571
He's better than you.

358
00:20:48,652 --> 00:20:50,242
He's just like me.

359
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:07,602
After receiving the gift, I was conflicted for a long time.

360
00:21:08,985 --> 00:21:13,042
Although I'm your boss, after seeing your sincerity,

361
00:21:13,152 --> 00:21:15,002
I can accept it.

362
00:21:15,099 --> 00:21:18,562
(Oh my god, how should I explain the gift to him?)

363
00:21:19,349 --> 00:21:21,642
(He must have thought I was confessing my love to him.)

364
00:21:22,127 --> 00:21:24,282
(And his parent also knew about it now.)

365
00:21:24,542 --> 00:21:26,292
(This is so embarrassing.)

366
00:21:27,338 --> 00:21:30,328
(But what does he mean when he said he can accept it?)

367
00:21:31,112 --> 00:21:32,782
(He can't possibly like me.)

368
00:21:34,133 --> 00:21:37,577
(Is he getting back at me for embarrassing him on his birthday?)

369
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,030
(Is that why he's pranking me?)

370
00:21:39,077 --> 00:21:40,297
(What should I do?)

371
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,870
(Will he fire me?)

372
00:21:44,657 --> 00:21:45,877
Boss.

373
00:21:47,212 --> 00:21:49,680
About the gift, I need to explain to you.

374
00:21:49,782 --> 00:21:51,550
You don't need to explain, it doesn't matter.

375
00:21:51,574 --> 00:21:53,602
I actually admire your courage.

376
00:21:55,579 --> 00:21:58,377
And I know I have some personal charm.

377
00:21:58,464 --> 00:22:00,764
So, I can understand if you occasionally lose control.

378
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:02,988
Boss, actually the gift

379
00:22:04,207 --> 00:22:05,922
was a mistake made by the seller.

380
00:22:06,235 --> 00:22:10,608
The gift I gave you had a note saying, "Bring me wealth, make me fly".

381
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:15,442
Maybe there were too many gifts, so the seller mixed them up.

382
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,160
So...

383
00:22:18,747 --> 00:22:20,538
You didn't confess to me.

384
00:22:22,063 --> 00:22:23,263
Yes, it's all a misunderstanding.

385
00:22:23,287 --> 00:22:24,566
Boss, I have a high level of awareness.

386
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,202
I have no improper thoughts about you.

387
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,570
I mean it.

388
00:23:24,134 --> 00:23:26,802
(Hello, the number you dialed has been turned off.)

389
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:40,963
- Hello, Lawyer Wu. - Cheng Yao, where does your sister live now?

390
00:23:41,607 --> 00:23:43,198
I can't tell you.

391
00:23:43,553 --> 00:23:44,888
Someone is bothering her now,

392
00:23:44,969 --> 00:23:46,038
(and her phone is turned off.)

393
00:23:46,062 --> 00:23:47,674
(If you don't tell me, what if something happens to her?)

394
00:23:47,698 --> 00:23:49,009
Who is bothering my sister?

395
00:23:49,904 --> 00:23:53,533
My sister lives in Unit 509, Lane 398, Chunhui North Road.

396
00:23:53,707 --> 00:23:55,802
(But I don't know if my sister is at home now.)

397
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,177
I'll rush over right away. You should come over too.

398
00:23:58,303 --> 00:23:59,523
Okay.

399
00:24:00,004 --> 00:24:01,224
What's wrong?

400
00:24:01,618 --> 00:24:03,522
Lawyer Wu said someone is bothering my sister.

401
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,517
Don't worry, we'll be there right away.

402
00:25:05,923 --> 00:25:08,323
- Cheng Xi, what are you doing? - What are you doing here?

403
00:25:08,634 --> 00:25:11,383
- I'm here to visit you. - No.

404
00:25:14,328 --> 00:25:15,762
What are you doing?

405
00:25:19,015 --> 00:25:21,442
Why are you so scared?

406
00:25:22,056 --> 00:25:24,157
- Are you hiding someone inside? - Let go.

407
00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:25,449
- Let me see who's inside. - Let go.

408
00:25:25,473 --> 00:25:27,882
- Let me see who you are hiding. - Let me go.

409
00:25:30,057 --> 00:25:32,618
Deng Ming, you're breaking into my house.

410
00:25:32,712 --> 00:25:34,687
You're a lawyer, don't you know the law?

411
00:25:36,297 --> 00:25:37,402
What?

412
00:25:37,957 --> 00:25:39,177
I'm breaking the law?

413
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:46,977
I'm here to visit my ex-wife.

414
00:25:47,134 --> 00:25:49,094
I'm here to chat with you. Am I breaking the law?

415
00:25:50,666 --> 00:25:52,426
Cheng Xi, you don't have to be afraid of me.

416
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:55,811
I forgave you for setting me up last time.

417
00:25:56,618 --> 00:25:59,358
Let me tell you, because of this incident, I've figured things out.

418
00:25:59,528 --> 00:26:01,319
You resent me so much, hate me so much,

419
00:26:02,082 --> 00:26:04,082
it's because you have feelings for me, right?

420
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,082
I don't have feelings for you. Don't be delusional.

421
00:26:08,262 --> 00:26:10,822
If you don't have feelings for me, who do you have feelings for?

422
00:26:11,548 --> 00:26:13,457
Is it Wu Jun?

423
00:26:13,537 --> 00:26:15,314
- Let go! - Let me tell you, he can compare to me.

424
00:26:15,338 --> 00:26:17,562
- Let go! - He can't compare to me.

425
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:18,845
Let go!

426
00:26:23,857 --> 00:26:26,842
Deng Ming, I'm telling you not to do anything extreme.

427
00:26:26,899 --> 00:26:29,578
If you have a criminal record, your son will look down on you.

428
00:26:29,658 --> 00:26:30,898
What criminal record do I have?

429
00:26:30,938 --> 00:26:31,977
Listen,

430
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:34,977
this is nothing more than a romantic dispute, you know?

431
00:26:35,057 --> 00:26:36,594
We have both been divorced for over a year.

432
00:26:36,618 --> 00:26:38,162
What romantic disputes do we have?

433
00:26:38,352 --> 00:26:39,802
My neighbor is a police officer.

434
00:26:39,946 --> 00:26:42,288
If you don't leave, I'll call him right away.

435
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,590
Where are you going?

436
00:26:45,977 --> 00:26:48,398
Sweet talk won't work, huh?

437
00:26:49,204 --> 00:26:51,482
Cheng Xi, let me tell you,

438
00:26:51,782 --> 00:26:53,204
I've said nice things to you.

439
00:26:53,314 --> 00:26:55,282
Don't embarrass yourself.

440
00:27:04,017 --> 00:27:06,962
Let me tell you, it hurt so much when you hit me,

441
00:27:07,545 --> 00:27:09,322
but I really liked it.

442
00:27:09,537 --> 00:27:11,242
I like it when you treat me like that.

443
00:27:12,418 --> 00:27:14,377
Let go!

444
00:27:14,511 --> 00:27:15,722
Help!

445
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:29,750
Get up!

446
00:27:29,831 --> 00:27:31,102
Help!

447
00:27:37,433 --> 00:27:39,393
There's a fire! Run!

448
00:27:39,489 --> 00:27:40,850
There's a fire! Run!

449
00:27:40,938 --> 00:27:42,487
There's a fire! Run!

450
00:27:44,272 --> 00:27:45,762
So unlucky.

451
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:53,809
Cheng Xi.

452
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:57,802
Are you okay?

453
00:27:58,836 --> 00:28:00,082
Don't cry.

454
00:28:00,287 --> 00:28:02,242
It's okay. I'm here. Don't be afraid.

455
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,840
Wu Jun, you're shameless.

456
00:28:06,921 --> 00:28:08,242
Did you just ambush me?

457
00:28:08,418 --> 00:28:10,850
Let me tell you, I used to practice martial arts.

458
00:28:10,931 --> 00:28:12,608
Do you really think I can't beat you?

459
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:30,195
You hit me until I bleed.

460
00:28:33,497 --> 00:28:35,137
Hello everyone, I'm Lawyer Deng Ming...

461
00:28:35,217 --> 00:28:36,732
Look, I was beaten.

462
00:28:36,813 --> 00:28:38,338
Did you see this? This is a nosebleed.

463
00:28:38,457 --> 00:28:40,367
I'm at my ex-wife's house now.

464
00:28:40,923 --> 00:28:43,062
It's him! This guy named Wu Jun,

465
00:28:43,143 --> 00:28:45,414
he's a lawyer at Junheng & Co.

466
00:28:46,618 --> 00:28:47,738
I have proof right here.

467
00:28:47,818 --> 00:28:48,937
Listen up, just you wait.

468
00:28:49,055 --> 00:28:50,285
This is not over.

469
00:28:50,471 --> 00:28:52,002
I'm calling the police now.

470
00:28:53,777 --> 00:28:54,937
110?

471
00:28:55,017 --> 00:28:57,008
I was beaten just now.

472
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,181
I'm at my ex-wife's house now.

473
00:28:59,262 --> 00:29:01,122
I was beaten by her lover.

474
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,128
I'm bleeding.

475
00:29:03,209 --> 00:29:04,518
I feel dizzy now.

476
00:29:06,017 --> 00:29:07,882
I was really beaten.

477
00:29:07,993 --> 00:29:10,073
Just you wait. When this thing gets out, I tell you,

478
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:12,442
Junheng & Co will have a lot to deal with.

479
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,470
He hit me!

480
00:29:21,618 --> 00:29:23,207
Sorry, please wait a moment.

481
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,938
(Sir, are you still there?)

482
00:29:32,894 --> 00:29:34,002
I'm here.

483
00:29:34,467 --> 00:29:36,562
I feel better now.

484
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:39,562
I'm not dizzy anymore. Thank you.

485
00:29:42,751 --> 00:29:44,002
No. Where did you get this?

486
00:29:44,639 --> 00:29:45,678
Where did you get this?

487
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:49,042
I installed surveillance cameras in my living room to watch my dog.

488
00:29:49,123 --> 00:29:51,470
Everything you just did was recorded.

489
00:29:51,551 --> 00:29:53,142
Mind yourself.

490
00:29:54,657 --> 00:29:56,282
Cheng Xi, you're so shameless.

491
00:29:56,366 --> 00:29:58,162
Come, give it to me!

492
00:30:04,531 --> 00:30:05,722
Come again?

493
00:30:06,102 --> 00:30:08,510
It wasn't me. It was you.

494
00:30:10,869 --> 00:30:12,260
This is the third time.

495
00:30:12,578 --> 00:30:15,407
Why don't I hit you for the fourth time?

496
00:30:21,433 --> 00:30:22,653
That's enough.

497
00:30:22,932 --> 00:30:25,042
- Hurry up. - I can't walk faster.

498
00:30:25,898 --> 00:30:27,977
I'm leaving.

499
00:30:28,111 --> 00:30:30,002
What are you doing? What do you want?

500
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,282
Give me my jacket.

501
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:40,999
Listen up,

502
00:30:41,195 --> 00:30:43,732
I have your video and you have my video.

503
00:30:43,859 --> 00:30:46,759
Let's call it even today. No one can mess with anyone. Did you hear me?

504
00:30:54,272 --> 00:30:55,497
What's wrong with your leg?

505
00:30:55,578 --> 00:30:57,920
Don't worry about my leg. I sprained my legs a little. I'm fine.

506
00:30:57,944 --> 00:30:59,076
How are you?

507
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:00,377
Are you injured?

508
00:31:01,992 --> 00:31:03,301
Talk, Cheng Xi.

509
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,682
How about we go to the hospital, okay?

510
00:31:13,501 --> 00:31:14,931
Sorry, I came late.

511
00:31:15,977 --> 00:31:17,202
Don't be afraid.

512
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,562
Don't be afraid.

513
00:31:21,138 --> 00:31:22,217
I'm fine.

514
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,035
Wei Zhen Tian is still at the pet shop.

515
00:31:24,116 --> 00:31:25,562
We have to pick it up.

516
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:34,610
I was so scared.

517
00:31:41,178 --> 00:31:42,398
Cheng Xi.

518
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:44,297
Cheng Xi, are you okay?

519
00:31:45,212 --> 00:31:46,443
Where is Deng Ming?

520
00:31:46,757 --> 00:31:48,842
Deng Ming was kicked out by me. Don't be afraid.

521
00:31:49,098 --> 00:31:50,563
We must call the police and arrest him.

522
00:31:50,587 --> 00:31:51,659
We can't just settle this quietly.

523
00:31:51,683 --> 00:31:53,322
Yao Yao, I'm fine, don't worry about it.

524
00:31:55,106 --> 00:31:56,162
Cheng Yao,

525
00:31:56,384 --> 00:31:59,114
we have no evidence that Deng Ming caused substantial harm to your sister.

526
00:31:59,138 --> 00:32:01,899
Even if we call the police now, it won't lead to a severe punishment.

527
00:32:05,126 --> 00:32:06,686
Doesn't he like to be in the limelight?

528
00:32:06,775 --> 00:32:09,415
Let's steal a few more cases from him to vent your sister's anger.

529
00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:12,562
- What do you say? - You can use my name to steal his cases.

530
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,181
That's what you said. I'll be nasty then.

531
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,220
Why did you come here?

532
00:32:22,668 --> 00:32:24,388
You're in trouble. How can I not come over?

533
00:32:26,859 --> 00:32:28,079
Thank you.

534
00:32:28,755 --> 00:32:29,975
Are you really okay?

535
00:32:43,554 --> 00:32:44,774
Thank you, boss.

536
00:33:40,016 --> 00:33:41,017
Boss?

537
00:33:41,184 --> 00:33:42,404
Do you want to eat crayfish?

538
00:33:43,649 --> 00:33:45,282
I have no appetite.

539
00:33:45,751 --> 00:33:47,471
Something happened to my employee's family.

540
00:33:47,638 --> 00:33:49,398
As the boss, I need to check on my employee.

541
00:33:52,921 --> 00:33:54,141
Shut up and come here.

542
00:34:02,243 --> 00:34:03,322
Try it.

543
00:34:06,133 --> 00:34:07,642
Boss, I really have no appetite.

544
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,964
Don't bother.

545
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,221
Still thinking about Cheng Xi?

546
00:34:16,511 --> 00:34:18,101
I was just thinking,

547
00:34:18,317 --> 00:34:20,426
my sister suffered so much injustice,

548
00:34:20,813 --> 00:34:22,363
but there's nothing I can do.

549
00:34:22,646 --> 00:34:24,197
I think Wu Jun has a point.

550
00:34:24,546 --> 00:34:26,439
After all, Cheng Xi didn't suffer real harm.

551
00:34:26,707 --> 00:34:28,507
It's hard to find evidence against Deng Ming.

552
00:34:29,374 --> 00:34:32,602
The way to deal with such a person is to make him fail in his career.

553
00:34:34,646 --> 00:34:36,037
I understand everything.

554
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:40,580
But I was wondering why my sister never called the police.

555
00:34:40,976 --> 00:34:43,697
Is it because she feels she has no one to rely on,

556
00:34:43,801 --> 00:34:45,900
so she wants to downplay the matter?

557
00:34:46,529 --> 00:34:48,489
Because she doesn't want to cause trouble for us?

558
00:34:49,936 --> 00:34:51,205
If you say so,

559
00:34:51,786 --> 00:34:53,925
Wu Jun might faint in the toilet from crying.

560
00:34:54,352 --> 00:34:56,842
He got injured because of Cheng Xi.

561
00:34:57,911 --> 00:35:01,860
I think your sister didn't call the police because she had other plans.

562
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:05,389
She's a lawyer and knows the legal terms very well.

563
00:35:05,653 --> 00:35:07,524
Maybe she's holding back something big.

564
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:11,568
She can tell me about it. I'm her real sister.

565
00:35:11,938 --> 00:35:13,138
She's your sister.

566
00:35:13,234 --> 00:35:14,537
Regarding the case of Bai Xing Meng,

567
00:35:14,561 --> 00:35:16,215
why didn't you tell her what happened then?

568
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,630
How can that be the same?

569
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:21,739
What I mean is that,

570
00:35:21,961 --> 00:35:24,297
even sisters have their own lives.

571
00:35:24,495 --> 00:35:26,922
You can help each other, but you can't interfere too much.

572
00:35:33,315 --> 00:35:34,882
My sister is so smart.

573
00:35:35,087 --> 00:35:37,727
There must be something she's thinking that I haven't figured out.

574
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:39,865
You know yourself.

575
00:35:44,257 --> 00:35:46,886
You've successfully demotivated an employee.

576
00:35:48,977 --> 00:35:50,722
All right, don't think about it now.

577
00:35:51,738 --> 00:35:53,717
Otherwise, Cheng Xi will also feel sorry for you.

578
00:35:59,513 --> 00:36:00,733
Eat up.

579
00:36:00,976 --> 00:36:03,296
I peeled so much for you, you haven't eaten a single bite.

580
00:36:09,984 --> 00:36:13,562
It's getting late. Why don't you go home and rest?

581
00:36:14,087 --> 00:36:15,127
What do you mean?

582
00:36:15,231 --> 00:36:16,562
You're abandoning me now?

583
00:36:16,663 --> 00:36:18,936
I mean, you have to go to work tomorrow.

584
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,300
I'm afraid if you don't rest well tonight, it may affect your work.

585
00:36:25,656 --> 00:36:27,642
I didn't mean to kick you out.

586
00:36:27,755 --> 00:36:28,975
You are.

587
00:36:32,602 --> 00:36:33,822
Finish everything.

588
00:36:42,977 --> 00:36:44,647
At least eat the ones I peeled for you.

589
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,907
Cheng Yao, he's your boss.

590
00:37:00,993 --> 00:37:02,303
Stop imagining things.

591
00:38:05,648 --> 00:38:06,998
My god.

592
00:38:09,297 --> 00:38:12,162
If this breaks, I won't be able to afford it even if I sell my life.

593
00:38:13,078 --> 00:38:14,678
I'll give it back to Qian Heng tomorrow.

594
00:38:27,189 --> 00:38:29,642
(After receiving the gift, I was conflicted for a long time.)

595
00:38:31,085 --> 00:38:32,537
Although I'm your boss,

596
00:38:32,617 --> 00:38:35,082
after seeing your sincerity,

597
00:38:35,214 --> 00:38:37,045
I can accept it.

598
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:39,482
(This must be a prank.)

599
00:38:39,585 --> 00:38:41,470
(I don't fit his aesthetic either.)

600
00:38:42,861 --> 00:38:46,522
(Cheng Yao, if you take it seriously, you're a big fool.)

601
00:38:54,237 --> 00:38:55,507
So annoying.

602
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,535
Coming.

603
00:40:15,623 --> 00:40:16,762
Wait a minute.

604
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,482
Hello, are you Mr. Wu?

605
00:40:22,604 --> 00:40:24,802
This is sent to you by Mr. Qian. Please sign for it.

606
00:40:26,356 --> 00:40:27,682
We'll carry it in for you.

607
00:40:27,796 --> 00:40:29,162
Okay, thank you.

608
00:40:30,187 --> 00:40:31,802
What is this?

609
00:40:37,861 --> 00:40:39,840
Okay, thank you. Wishing you a speedy recovery.

610
00:40:46,059 --> 00:40:47,289
What is this?

611
00:40:49,732 --> 00:40:51,241
Such a big bow.

612
00:40:53,602 --> 00:40:57,722
(Specially designed for elderly people)

613
00:40:58,252 --> 00:40:59,602
Qian Heng!

614
00:41:01,137 --> 00:41:02,357
You're the old man!

615
00:41:03,077 --> 00:41:04,842
You're not really sorry about me.

616
00:41:04,939 --> 00:41:06,490
You're just cursing me.

617
00:41:07,176 --> 00:41:08,362
(It's an original import.)

618
00:41:08,523 --> 00:41:11,226
(To commend you for winning the Golden Scales Award for the firm.)

619
00:41:11,307 --> 00:41:12,802
Original import?

620
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:14,922
I'm so mad.

621
00:41:15,546 --> 00:41:16,577
Qian Heng, right?

622
00:41:16,735 --> 00:41:18,762
Are you doing this on purpose?

623
00:41:19,982 --> 00:41:21,202
Cheng Xi?

624
00:41:21,539 --> 00:41:22,619
What brings you here?

625
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,971
I'm here to visit you.

626
00:41:24,547 --> 00:41:25,767
Come in.

627
00:41:26,152 --> 00:41:27,762
You came with flowers.

628
00:41:29,818 --> 00:41:32,528
I just happened to pass by, and they were selling it downstairs.

629
00:41:34,198 --> 00:41:35,922
How do you know I like sunflowers?

630
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:38,642
- Really? - Yes, they are as beautiful as you.

631
00:41:39,537 --> 00:41:41,717
I'll get you slippers. Hold this.

632
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:46,602
I bought you new slippers.

633
00:41:46,683 --> 00:41:48,108
I bought your size.

634
00:41:48,189 --> 00:41:50,749
They are matching couple shoes. I haven't even cut off the tags.

635
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:53,122
Okay, here you go.

636
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:54,510
Put them on.

637
00:41:57,093 --> 00:41:58,313
Come, give me the flowers.

638
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:01,993
Don't worry about it, just leave it there.

639
00:42:02,017 --> 00:42:03,263
- It's okay. - Let's go.

640
00:42:03,344 --> 00:42:04,932
It's okay. Never mind. Let's go.

641
00:42:07,378 --> 00:42:08,802
Your legs...

642
00:42:15,097 --> 00:42:16,585
I'm not going to sit in this wheelchair.

643
00:42:16,609 --> 00:42:17,879
I can push you.

644
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:20,844
It would be a bit rude not to sit on it.

645
00:42:20,925 --> 00:42:22,086
- Sure. - Take it easy.

646
00:42:22,175 --> 00:42:23,202
Okay.

647
00:42:26,137 --> 00:42:27,138
This feels good.

648
00:42:27,218 --> 00:42:28,953
When I'm old, you can push me like this too,

649
00:42:28,977 --> 00:42:30,417
and we'll go wherever we want.

650
00:42:30,497 --> 00:42:31,717
How nice.

651
00:42:32,017 --> 00:42:34,658
Cheng Xi, why did you suddenly visit me today?

652
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:35,981
Do you miss me?

653
00:42:40,212 --> 00:42:41,322
Cheng Xi.

654
00:42:42,183 --> 00:42:44,333
You didn't purposely come to visit me today

655
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:48,282
just to reject me, right?

656
00:42:55,017 --> 00:42:56,698
You got hurt because of me.

657
00:42:56,778 --> 00:42:58,258
Of course I have to come and see you.

658
00:42:58,297 --> 00:43:01,206
This is just a minor injury.

659
00:43:01,899 --> 00:43:03,928
I purposely learned Sanda because of Deng Ming.

660
00:43:04,126 --> 00:43:06,846
That guy, whenever I see him in the future, I'll teach him a lesson.

661
00:43:08,696 --> 00:43:10,991
You don't need to worry anymore. I'll protect you wherever you go.

662
00:43:11,015 --> 00:43:12,375
We don't have to be afraid of him.

663
00:43:13,463 --> 00:43:15,693
I'm no longer afraid of Deng Ming.

664
00:43:16,688 --> 00:43:18,809
Nothing he does can hurt me.

665
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,190
That's great.

666
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,860
It's mainly you.

667
00:43:24,611 --> 00:43:26,921
Your kindness and what you've done for me

668
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,242
make me feel burdened.
