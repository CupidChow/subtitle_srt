1
00:01:35,602 --> 00:01:38,842
(My Boss)

2
00:01:40,082 --> 00:01:42,568
(Episode 4)

3
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:45,722
(Boss, why did you bring me home?)

4
00:01:59,354 --> 00:02:00,354
Evidence...

5
00:02:01,408 --> 00:02:02,562
Evidence.

6
00:02:14,297 --> 00:02:15,304
Get off.

7
00:02:16,905 --> 00:02:17,964
Get off.

8
00:02:21,515 --> 00:02:22,864
I can't move.

9
00:02:24,515 --> 00:02:26,482
Cheng Yao, I'm telling you. Don't challenge my bottom line.

10
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,624
Get off!

11
00:02:57,492 --> 00:02:58,642
Where to?

12
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:00,583
Go.

13
00:03:01,558 --> 00:03:02,722
That fast?

14
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,174
We're home already?

15
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:11,269
That's fast.

16
00:03:29,749 --> 00:03:31,179
This is video evidence.

17
00:03:32,065 --> 00:03:33,414
Cheng Yao, the party involved.

18
00:03:33,495 --> 00:03:36,636
Do you need Qian Heng to provide assistance services?

19
00:03:36,752 --> 00:03:40,198
If yes, you need to pay service fees to Qian Heng.

20
00:03:40,515 --> 00:03:42,906
Cheng Yao, the party involved. Do you agree?

21
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,954
Cheng Yao, the party involved. Do you need Qian Heng to send you home?

22
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:00,559
You can just nod or shake your head.

23
00:04:07,795 --> 00:04:09,105
Cheng Yao, the party involved.

24
00:04:10,057 --> 00:04:12,207
Do you agree to this

25
00:04:12,442 --> 00:04:14,311
no matter what method I use?

26
00:04:18,555 --> 00:04:19,555
Do you?

27
00:04:23,812 --> 00:04:25,483
All right. The video confirmation is complete.

28
00:04:29,034 --> 00:04:30,944
What happened?

29
00:04:31,075 --> 00:04:34,074
Hello. This is my last resort.

30
00:04:34,154 --> 00:04:36,594
Can you help me pack her up and follow me via the car?

31
00:04:36,674 --> 00:04:38,184
Together, let's take her back.

32
00:04:39,114 --> 00:04:40,414
Thank you. Sorry for the trouble.

33
00:04:48,408 --> 00:04:50,282
Why are you taking me home?

34
00:04:50,755 --> 00:04:52,042
To unclog the drains.

35
00:04:52,218 --> 00:04:53,318
Otherwise, what do you think?

36
00:04:58,195 --> 00:04:59,195
Get up.

37
00:05:06,012 --> 00:05:07,442
I can't get up.

38
00:05:09,786 --> 00:05:11,663
Can you pull me up, boss?

39
00:05:11,932 --> 00:05:13,403
I'm really impressed.

40
00:05:22,411 --> 00:05:23,522
What are you doing?

41
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:33,161
What's wrong with you?

42
00:05:33,713 --> 00:05:37,002
Such a beautiful young lady is in front of you

43
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,809
but in your eyes you only see drains?

44
00:05:41,755 --> 00:05:42,755
Cheng Yao,

45
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,350
you will pay for your actions today.

46
00:05:51,043 --> 00:05:52,304
But boss,

47
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:56,505
seeing you up close makes you look even more handsome.

48
00:05:58,602 --> 00:06:01,135
If it weren't for your face, I wouldn't be paying attention to you.

49
00:06:04,456 --> 00:06:06,166
But, you're so rich.

50
00:06:07,435 --> 00:06:09,225
Did you do any plastic surgery?

51
00:06:14,154 --> 00:06:15,624
Your nose is so straight.

52
00:06:16,195 --> 00:06:17,394
Is it padded?

53
00:06:17,497 --> 00:06:18,797
And, your eyelashes.

54
00:06:20,515 --> 00:06:21,515
Are they real?

55
00:06:29,674 --> 00:06:31,265
Tomorrow is your last day.

56
00:07:08,318 --> 00:07:09,788
My head hurts so much.

57
00:07:11,018 --> 00:07:12,039
You're awake?

58
00:07:17,457 --> 00:07:18,482
Boss.

59
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:24,282
(Help! Why is he looking at me like that?)

60
00:07:27,312 --> 00:07:30,722
(I drank too much last night. I didn't do anything bad, right?)

61
00:07:31,848 --> 00:07:33,322
Is my nose padded?

62
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,242
But, you're so rich.

63
00:07:38,106 --> 00:07:40,015
Did you do any plastic surgery?

64
00:07:41,697 --> 00:07:43,407
Your nose is so straight.

65
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:44,875
Is it padded?

66
00:07:45,017 --> 00:07:46,486
And, your eyelashes.

67
00:07:46,835 --> 00:07:47,962
Are they real?

68
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:50,082
(Oh no! What have I done?)

69
00:07:50,186 --> 00:07:51,246
You remember now?

70
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,800
Okay. Since we're in the same firm, I won't take the legal route.

71
00:07:54,995 --> 00:07:56,202
Let's settle it privately.

72
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:59,194
I have already made a list of the direct economic losses caused.

73
00:07:59,336 --> 00:08:00,437
Take a look.

74
00:08:05,555 --> 00:08:07,115
But, I drank too much last night.

75
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:10,785
Many of the actions were uncontrollable. It shouldn't count, right?

76
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,842
You are over the age of 18.

77
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:16,265
You are not a mentally ill person who cannot identify your own behavior.

78
00:08:16,465 --> 00:08:17,559
You do not meet the definition of

79
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,504
a person with limited capacity for civil conduct.

80
00:08:20,075 --> 00:08:22,274
So, you must be responsible for what you do.

81
00:08:22,354 --> 00:08:24,815
Drinking is not a legal excuse for evading responsibility.

82
00:08:29,527 --> 00:08:32,474
Vehicle cleaning fees, maintenance fees, deodorization fees...

83
00:08:35,754 --> 00:08:37,674
Boss. You went on a blind date yesterday, right?

84
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:38,835
The clothes are so expensive.

85
00:08:38,915 --> 00:08:39,955
These are my everyday clothes.

86
00:08:40,035 --> 00:08:41,934
You don't need to understand. Just pay the bill.

87
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:44,315
Oh, right.

88
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,362
Plus the freight fee, 2,050 yuan. I forgot to write it down.

89
00:08:48,496 --> 00:08:50,565
Freight fee? What's that about?

90
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,360
I delivered you home yesterday with an express box.

91
00:08:53,641 --> 00:08:55,122
The courier took 50 yuan from me,

92
00:08:55,257 --> 00:08:57,991
but I put you in and took you out again, which took two minutes in total.

93
00:08:58,087 --> 00:08:59,962
According to my night-time hourly rate, I'll round it off.

94
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:02,342
This is the video.

95
00:09:02,648 --> 00:09:03,648
Take a look and see.

96
00:09:07,328 --> 00:09:10,172
(Do you need Qian Heng to provide assistance services?)

97
00:09:10,253 --> 00:09:13,750
(If yes, you need to pay service fees to Qian Heng.)

98
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:15,780
(Cheng Yao, the party involved. Do you agree?)

99
00:09:28,312 --> 00:09:30,122
Boss. It's like this.

100
00:09:30,345 --> 00:09:33,366
Even if I put in all my savings, it won't be enough.

101
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,671
Can we discuss this over?

102
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,375
Can we pay in installments?

103
00:09:37,754 --> 00:09:38,754
No.

104
00:09:41,187 --> 00:09:42,896
If you really can't pay it,

105
00:09:43,394 --> 00:09:44,825
we can find a workaround.

106
00:09:47,275 --> 00:09:48,986
Co-rental Agreement?

107
00:09:49,267 --> 00:09:50,267
Right.

108
00:09:53,043 --> 00:09:54,303
Move back in?

109
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,562
Pay off the debt with labor?

110
00:09:55,749 --> 00:09:58,299
Right. These are all the rules and regulations.

111
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:00,378
There are two main points.

112
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:03,065
First, neither of us can enter the other's room.

113
00:10:03,675 --> 00:10:06,402
But, you must take responsibility for all the housework in the common area,

114
00:10:06,714 --> 00:10:08,144
including unclogging the drains.

115
00:10:08,466 --> 00:10:11,067
Secondly, I have priority in using the common area space.

116
00:10:11,148 --> 00:10:12,242
The kitchen is an exception.

117
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:14,532
You must make me a midnight snack every night.

118
00:10:14,643 --> 00:10:17,842
There are other rules, including no pets

119
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:19,722
and no inviting others over without permission, etc.

120
00:10:19,803 --> 00:10:22,274
There are over 200 rules. I hope you can read and memorize them.

121
00:10:23,067 --> 00:10:25,002
248 rules?

122
00:10:26,195 --> 00:10:28,482
Boss. Did you plan this early on?

123
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:30,867
Otherwise, how could you list 248 rules in one night?

124
00:10:31,002 --> 00:10:33,122
This is the basic ability as a lawyer.

125
00:10:33,443 --> 00:10:34,544
Do you have any questions?

126
00:10:35,955 --> 00:10:36,975
No questions.

127
00:10:39,275 --> 00:10:40,455
Oh, right, boss.

128
00:10:41,061 --> 00:10:43,562
Do you like watching idol dramas?

129
00:10:44,275 --> 00:10:45,945
You can also choose to pay the money.

130
00:10:47,955 --> 00:10:49,141
At the boss's command,

131
00:10:49,222 --> 00:10:51,452
I will work like oxen and horses without complaint.

132
00:11:17,075 --> 00:11:18,465
With these,

133
00:11:18,675 --> 00:11:20,634
even if a real freak comes knocking,

134
00:11:20,744 --> 00:11:22,534
we won't be defeated in one go.

135
00:11:29,562 --> 00:11:31,402
Come on, sir. Just put it there.

136
00:11:31,514 --> 00:11:32,514
All right.

137
00:11:32,594 --> 00:11:34,042
- Thank you.   - You're welcome.

138
00:11:36,075 --> 00:11:37,765
- Sorry for the trouble.   - No problem at all.

139
00:11:38,748 --> 00:11:42,082
A bottle of Kongyun, that's worth tens of yuan.

140
00:11:43,435 --> 00:11:45,984
Drinking this water is like burning money.

141
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,802
Actually, boiled tap water is also not harmful to health.

142
00:11:51,994 --> 00:11:53,434
It won't harm my health,

143
00:11:53,514 --> 00:11:55,425
but it will damage my style.

144
00:11:56,234 --> 00:11:57,794
As an employee benefit,

145
00:11:57,874 --> 00:11:59,624
I allow you to drink with me.

146
00:12:00,155 --> 00:12:01,705
Thank you very much, boss.

147
00:12:04,634 --> 00:12:05,814
Why did you buy this?

148
00:12:06,075 --> 00:12:07,634
Isn't the security here bad?

149
00:12:07,714 --> 00:12:08,715
I just have one prepared.

150
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:10,105
It's better to be prepared than sorry.

151
00:12:11,195 --> 00:12:12,495
Don't think too much.

152
00:12:13,505 --> 00:12:15,762
You're living with me, but I'm not interested in you.

153
00:12:19,369 --> 00:12:21,320
You... You brought durians home?

154
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:22,821
Can't I?

155
00:12:24,795 --> 00:12:27,225
Let's add one more rule. You can't eat durians indoors.

156
00:12:44,714 --> 00:12:47,174
I have to lower my head since I'm living under your reign.

157
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:49,054
I'll eat this outside.

158
00:12:53,754 --> 00:12:56,065
(Ling Yao, what do you think of Yilan Garden?)

159
00:12:56,874 --> 00:12:58,744
You're still chasing this bad drama.

160
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,030
It's noise pollution.

161
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,922
How can this be a bad drama?

162
00:13:02,084 --> 00:13:04,114
It's one of the hottest dramas recently.

163
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,279
The female lead is Bai Xing Meng.

164
00:13:09,195 --> 00:13:10,522
So what about Bai Xing Meng?

165
00:13:10,729 --> 00:13:12,798
Bai Xing Meng is beautiful outside,

166
00:13:13,795 --> 00:13:14,814
but not inside.

167
00:13:15,035 --> 00:13:18,384
How can Bai Xing Meng compare to our great boss?

168
00:13:20,331 --> 00:13:22,372
It's almost 11 o'clock. Go and cook.

169
00:13:23,572 --> 00:13:25,872
Boss, why do you like to eat supper so much?

170
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,674
(If he likes to eat supper so much,)

171
00:13:31,002 --> 00:13:33,122
(what if I order a luxury set meal?)

172
00:13:33,322 --> 00:13:37,386
(Will it move him and make him waive some of my debt?)

173
00:13:40,382 --> 00:13:41,962
I'm really smart.

174
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,600
(Why haven't I fallen asleep yet?)

175
00:14:09,838 --> 00:14:10,940
What does that mean?

176
00:14:11,119 --> 00:14:12,611
You try to cut corners with takeouts.

177
00:14:12,713 --> 00:14:14,482
How can this be cutting corners?

178
00:14:14,611 --> 00:14:17,682
I spent a lot of money ordering from a five-star hotel.

179
00:14:17,846 --> 00:14:19,645
Then, why do you use plates to serve it again?

180
00:14:20,002 --> 00:14:21,442
For the ceremonial feeling.

181
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:24,545
How can I let you eat from a takeout box?

182
00:14:27,675 --> 00:14:28,922
Boss, look.

183
00:14:29,371 --> 00:14:31,041
Papaya stewed with snow clam.

184
00:14:33,793 --> 00:14:34,924
Buddha's Temptation.

185
00:14:35,061 --> 00:14:36,361
Make the supper again.

186
00:14:37,941 --> 00:14:38,960
What?

187
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:46,162
What I mean is do you not like what I ordered, boss?

188
00:14:46,362 --> 00:14:48,294
If you like something else, I can order it again.

189
00:14:49,381 --> 00:14:50,890
I just want you to make it yourself.

190
00:14:53,548 --> 00:14:55,122
Oh, boss. You like home-cooked food.

191
00:15:15,568 --> 00:15:16,868
Let's eat, boss.

192
00:15:21,946 --> 00:15:22,972
Make it again.

193
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:25,138
What?

194
00:15:25,517 --> 00:15:28,294
Just cook what you cooked the other day you lived here.

195
00:15:29,325 --> 00:15:31,705
- What about these?   - You don't need to worry about that.

196
00:15:48,825 --> 00:15:50,273
Let's eat, boss.

197
00:15:50,963 --> 00:15:52,161
(She's done two rounds of cooking now.)

198
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:53,562
(Why haven't I fallen asleep yet?)

199
00:15:59,013 --> 00:16:00,650
Boss, supper is ready.

200
00:16:02,338 --> 00:16:04,234
(Did I do something wrong?)

201
00:16:04,518 --> 00:16:05,827
What are you up to?

202
00:16:06,254 --> 00:16:07,554
Are you asleep?

203
00:16:07,975 --> 00:16:09,442
(My foot!)

204
00:16:17,783 --> 00:16:20,504
I've been working for two hours and spent so much money.

205
00:16:58,063 --> 00:16:59,083
Boss.

206
00:16:59,533 --> 00:17:01,004
Can I ask you something?

207
00:17:01,085 --> 00:17:02,085
Go ahead.

208
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:05,153
You don't eat supper. Why do you want me to make them?

209
00:17:06,201 --> 00:17:07,762
Eating supper is not good for my health.

210
00:17:08,792 --> 00:17:11,183
Does that mean me eating them is good for my health?

211
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,222
What does your health have to do with me?

212
00:17:13,442 --> 00:17:15,682
Then, don't let me make it next time if you don't eat it.

213
00:17:15,762 --> 00:17:17,113
I was very full.

214
00:17:17,522 --> 00:17:19,712
Okay. You can also choose to pay for it.

215
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:26,108
You're annoying.

216
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,853
Wu Jun, when will you finally pursue Cheng Xi successfully?

217
00:17:43,934 --> 00:17:45,323
When will she leave?

218
00:17:45,742 --> 00:17:48,143
What's wrong? Did she offend you?

219
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,550
Or is it because of work?

220
00:17:49,709 --> 00:17:50,861
It's okay. Don't worry.

221
00:17:50,942 --> 00:17:52,782
If she can't deliver at work, I'll slowly teach her.

222
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:55,686
She's not that bad.

223
00:17:55,797 --> 00:17:58,437
Within her limited IQ range, she has delivered.

224
00:17:58,557 --> 00:17:59,627
Isn't that great?

225
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,148
Then, why are you targeting her?

226
00:18:01,317 --> 00:18:02,937
- But, she...   - But what?

227
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:05,781
Say it.

228
00:18:06,492 --> 00:18:07,762
Forget it.

229
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:11,602
Are you targeting me here?

230
00:18:12,203 --> 00:18:13,291
Not at all.

231
00:18:13,372 --> 00:18:14,432
Qian,

232
00:18:14,838 --> 00:18:17,522
can you accumulate some virtue for the sake of my love life?

233
00:18:17,845 --> 00:18:20,002
Let's take a step back. Let's not talk about me first.

234
00:18:20,329 --> 00:18:21,618
Regarding your reputation as a cancer of the industry,

235
00:18:21,699 --> 00:18:23,333
you must rely on me to relieve it, right?

236
00:18:23,637 --> 00:18:24,937
I don't care.

237
00:18:25,474 --> 00:18:27,574
How can you not care about such a big thing?

238
00:18:27,903 --> 00:18:30,697
Besides, where is this place? This is a law firm.

239
00:18:30,812 --> 00:18:32,884
What we emphasize is fairness and virtue.

240
00:18:32,965 --> 00:18:34,065
Okay. Fine.

241
00:18:34,387 --> 00:18:35,922
I shouldn't have asked you to come. Leave.

242
00:18:36,003 --> 00:18:37,023
I can't.

243
00:18:37,151 --> 00:18:40,282
Your thinking now has a serious problem. I have to talk to you properly.

244
00:19:02,996 --> 00:19:03,996
Cheng Yao.

245
00:19:05,922 --> 00:19:07,467
I heard you braved the storm

246
00:19:07,548 --> 00:19:09,322
and went to the Administration for Market Regulation to get something.

247
00:19:09,403 --> 00:19:10,928
You lost a set of clothes, a backpack,

248
00:19:11,009 --> 00:19:12,362
and a pair of shoes because of that, right?

249
00:19:12,462 --> 00:19:15,162
I particularly appreciate your contribution to Junheng,

250
00:19:15,603 --> 00:19:18,242
so I decided to reimburse you for everything.

251
00:19:18,722 --> 00:19:20,405
I'll also add more allowance for the transportation.

252
00:19:20,486 --> 00:19:21,486
Is that okay?

253
00:19:22,163 --> 00:19:25,522
It's confidential. The other interns don't get this kind of treatment.

254
00:19:26,812 --> 00:19:28,243
Thank you, Lawyer Wu.

255
00:19:28,588 --> 00:19:31,802
But, is it appropriate for you to do this?

256
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,020
It's fine.

257
00:19:34,957 --> 00:19:37,197
Qian Heng doesn't have a very good temper.

258
00:19:37,278 --> 00:19:39,708
So, in daily life, just be nice to him.

259
00:19:39,915 --> 00:19:41,682
This money can be considered

260
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:44,402
a small compensation for mental damage from me. Is that okay?

261
00:19:44,525 --> 00:19:46,764
If he makes you do something out of the ordinary in the future,

262
00:19:46,845 --> 00:19:47,845
just do it

263
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,802
as long as it's not illegal.

264
00:19:50,918 --> 00:19:51,918
Get busy.

265
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:03,994
I finally found you two.

266
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,242
Why is it you two again?

267
00:20:05,363 --> 00:20:07,124
Lawyer Qian. Please come back with us.

268
00:20:07,213 --> 00:20:08,263
I said I won't go back.

269
00:20:08,344 --> 00:20:09,505
This way, we can't finish our work.

270
00:20:09,586 --> 00:20:11,202
Is there really a psychopathic killer?

271
00:20:11,282 --> 00:20:12,723
- You must come back with us.   - What are you doing?

272
00:20:12,818 --> 00:20:13,942
My boss, I'm here to protect you.

273
00:20:14,023 --> 00:20:15,533
Boss, I'm here to save you.

274
00:20:17,573 --> 00:20:18,573
Run!

275
00:20:19,381 --> 00:20:20,582
Go! They're going to kill you.

276
00:20:20,663 --> 00:20:22,463
- Hurry! Otherwise, you won't...   - Are you insane?

277
00:20:22,544 --> 00:20:24,242
I'm just trying to save you.

278
00:20:24,381 --> 00:20:26,601
You used the anti-wolf spray to spray my mother's bodyguards?

279
00:20:32,135 --> 00:20:33,235
Sorry.

280
00:20:33,557 --> 00:20:34,637
Sorry.

281
00:20:34,718 --> 00:20:35,818
Please wipe it off.

282
00:20:45,923 --> 00:20:46,923
Dad.

283
00:21:08,532 --> 00:21:11,842
I'm afraid I won't make it.

284
00:21:18,439 --> 00:21:22,402
Enough already, Mom. I heard you.

285
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:24,259
What do you want me to do?

286
00:21:26,677 --> 00:21:28,066
My son.

287
00:21:29,332 --> 00:21:32,201
It looks like I won't have many days left.

288
00:21:32,315 --> 00:21:35,195
After I die, donate my body

289
00:21:35,276 --> 00:21:39,232
to the hospital for research.

290
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:42,194
My beautiful eyes,

291
00:21:42,579 --> 00:21:44,242
kind heart,

292
00:21:44,422 --> 00:21:45,602
and my liver...

293
00:21:45,788 --> 00:21:47,282
Give them all away if they can be used.

294
00:21:47,363 --> 00:21:49,802
Let's benefit as many people as we can.

295
00:21:51,323 --> 00:21:53,402
- I said this?   - You said it.

296
00:21:53,663 --> 00:21:54,842
Since I said it,

297
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,689
let's change the subject.

298
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:01,729
All of my heritage

299
00:22:01,858 --> 00:22:04,259
including all my movable and immovable property...

300
00:22:04,339 --> 00:22:06,122
Leave it all to me.

301
00:22:07,269 --> 00:22:08,482
I said this as well?

302
00:22:08,566 --> 00:22:09,707
Countless times.

303
00:22:11,624 --> 00:22:14,802
Mom. Skip all of this. Do you have any requests?

304
00:22:14,891 --> 00:22:15,991
Just say it directly.

305
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,315
I'm already like this.

306
00:22:19,396 --> 00:22:21,067
Why are you still behaving like this?

307
00:22:22,806 --> 00:22:25,287
My heart hurts so much.

308
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:26,375
Mom.

309
00:22:26,486 --> 00:22:28,362
In those 365 days a year,

310
00:22:28,443 --> 00:22:29,922
you spend 200 days staying in bed

311
00:22:30,055 --> 00:22:31,562
to have Dad accompany you to eat.

312
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:33,202
You spend 100 days having depression

313
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,922
to have me come back and talk to you.

314
00:22:35,069 --> 00:22:37,492
You also spend 65 days running away from home

315
00:22:37,657 --> 00:22:39,282
to have Dad and me run around to bring you back.

316
00:22:39,363 --> 00:22:41,322
You're torturing yourself every day. Aren't you tired?

317
00:22:42,155 --> 00:22:43,156
I'm tired.

318
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:45,282
Who am I suffering so much for?

319
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,230
It's all for you.

320
00:22:47,396 --> 00:22:49,116
I've read your medical report.

321
00:22:49,196 --> 00:22:51,316
You don't get enough rest and nutrition.

322
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:52,713
You are overworked.

323
00:22:54,883 --> 00:22:55,924
Qian Heng.

324
00:22:56,005 --> 00:22:59,552
I've worked so hard to raise you into an adult.

325
00:22:59,764 --> 00:23:04,122
You wouldn't make me attend your funeral, right?

326
00:23:04,207 --> 00:23:07,482
Mom. It's just that I don't sleep well.

327
00:23:07,774 --> 00:23:09,122
It's not a big deal.

328
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:11,542
Why do you plan to kidnap me to a sanatorium?

329
00:23:13,671 --> 00:23:15,082
Did you forget?

330
00:23:15,223 --> 00:23:16,842
When you were three,

331
00:23:16,923 --> 00:23:18,123
you said you wanted to eat fish.

332
00:23:18,269 --> 00:23:20,322
It was a day of heavy snow and wind.

333
00:23:20,462 --> 00:23:22,722
So, I went to the market to get you some fish.

334
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,110
But, there was really no fish in the market.

335
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,709
So, I went to the frozen lake to fish.

336
00:23:26,835 --> 00:23:29,185
I almost fell into the frozen lake.

337
00:23:29,364 --> 00:23:31,205
And then, another time, you said you wanted to go

338
00:23:31,308 --> 00:23:32,442
on a trip to the Tibetan Plateau.

339
00:23:32,595 --> 00:23:34,465
I had just been laid off then

340
00:23:34,604 --> 00:23:36,272
and didn't have much money.

341
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:41,103
So, I sold blood to get you the money for the trip.

342
00:23:41,215 --> 00:23:44,291
We almost died from altitude sickness.

343
00:23:44,379 --> 00:23:45,596
Do you remember?

344
00:23:45,677 --> 00:23:47,117
The way you behave today

345
00:23:47,213 --> 00:23:49,762
shows you really have no conscience.

346
00:23:50,112 --> 00:23:51,401
No, Mom. It's not that I have no conscience.

347
00:23:51,482 --> 00:23:53,027
You're talking about things when I was young.

348
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,322
Are you afraid I'll recall things after I grow up,

349
00:23:54,403 --> 00:23:55,922
and I'll expose you?

350
00:23:56,085 --> 00:23:58,406
I promise you. I will take good care of my body.

351
00:23:58,487 --> 00:24:00,556
Within three months, I'll be back to normal.

352
00:24:01,249 --> 00:24:02,762
- Really?   - Really.

353
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:07,747
Dad. Do you know what happened to Mom...

354
00:24:07,828 --> 00:24:09,242
You're leaving so soon?

355
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:10,912
Be careful on the road.

356
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:20,242
I only have a few minutes to read the news.

357
00:24:22,342 --> 00:24:24,642
Dad. Do you know what Mom said?

358
00:24:24,732 --> 00:24:26,811
She said she's been having bad luck since she married you.

359
00:24:26,892 --> 00:24:27,902
More than 20 years ago,

360
00:24:27,983 --> 00:24:29,903
she had no money to buy fish, so she had to go fish.

361
00:24:30,076 --> 00:24:31,962
We had no money to travel, so she had to sell blood.

362
00:24:32,043 --> 00:24:33,043
Do you know that?

363
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,570
Heng.

364
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:37,842
Our family's conditions have always been good.

365
00:24:38,006 --> 00:24:39,716
Do you believe what she said?

366
00:24:39,989 --> 00:24:41,049
How am I supposed to know?

367
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,190
Heng.

368
00:24:46,516 --> 00:24:48,322
Let me tell you something serious.

369
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:52,104
That law firm of yours, just close it.

370
00:24:52,293 --> 00:24:53,814
Come back and take over the family business

371
00:24:53,956 --> 00:24:55,746
and take care of your mom.

372
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:59,442
We'll take turns, one week each.

373
00:24:59,523 --> 00:25:00,642
How about that?

374
00:25:00,813 --> 00:25:03,934
For this kind of blessing, you should enjoy it yourself. I can't take it.

375
00:25:05,446 --> 00:25:08,282
- Heng...   - Hey, Dad. Please stop.

376
00:25:09,022 --> 00:25:11,852
It doesn't matter what you learn. Just don't learn Mom's acting.

377
00:25:12,139 --> 00:25:13,362
It's too bad.

378
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:18,185
Is my acting bad?

379
00:25:19,773 --> 00:25:21,164
My acting is bad?

380
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:25,512
Is it worse than your mom's?

381
00:25:32,467 --> 00:25:34,242
(Tomorrow afternoon, I have to go handle a case.)

382
00:25:34,396 --> 00:25:36,283
(After that, we can have a meal together.)

383
00:25:36,363 --> 00:25:38,122
(I'll send you the address.)

384
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,871
How did I end up here?

385
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:31,642
You're awake?

386
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:33,042
It's nothing serious.

387
00:27:33,155 --> 00:27:34,476
It's just a bit of hypoglycemia.

388
00:27:34,565 --> 00:27:35,762
Hey, buddy.

389
00:27:36,084 --> 00:27:37,924
Exercise moderately.

390
00:27:38,012 --> 00:27:39,322
If you don't have enough strength,

391
00:27:39,454 --> 00:27:40,842
don't push yourself too hard.

392
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,394
How far is it from the playground to the medical room?

393
00:27:44,524 --> 00:27:46,331
Your girlfriend carried you all the way here.

394
00:27:46,412 --> 00:27:47,613
She sweated a lot.

395
00:27:47,717 --> 00:27:48,936
It must have been tiring.

396
00:27:50,006 --> 00:27:51,962
Oh, right. Your girlfriend said

397
00:27:52,043 --> 00:27:53,882
she put a piece of chocolate in your pocket.

398
00:27:53,949 --> 00:27:55,242
After you wake up,

399
00:27:55,347 --> 00:27:57,962
you can have a few bites to replenish some sugar.

400
00:28:22,403 --> 00:28:23,502
Who?

401
00:28:24,962 --> 00:28:27,322
You're having another girlfriend who sells face masks?

402
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:28,663
I've told you so many times.

403
00:28:28,744 --> 00:28:30,121
I've changed my behavior now.

404
00:28:30,202 --> 00:28:32,162
If you bring up the past again, I'll quarrel with you.

405
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:33,362
Oh, will you?

406
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:43,061
Qian, I'm telling you. My new face mask is really good.

407
00:28:43,142 --> 00:28:45,042
I'll give you two boxes. Look. After I put this one on,

408
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:46,456
is my skin glowing now?

409
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:50,202
Let me tell you, in this world,

410
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:51,969
there are no ugly men, only lazy men.

411
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,427
Look at me, all dressed up like this.

412
00:28:53,522 --> 00:28:54,822
Not dressing up is better than this.

413
00:28:55,084 --> 00:28:56,673
What are you going to do?

414
00:28:58,171 --> 00:28:59,481
I'm going to fall in love.

415
00:29:08,706 --> 00:29:11,006
The goddess said yes to my date request.

416
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:14,122
You came just in time. Help me pick out some clothes, will you?

417
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:19,322
How about this white one? Is it good?

418
00:29:19,403 --> 00:29:20,913
It looks quite grand.

419
00:29:21,695 --> 00:29:23,044
It's a bit plain.

420
00:29:23,792 --> 00:29:25,082
This red one? This red one looks good.

421
00:29:25,186 --> 00:29:26,305
It's very festive.

422
00:29:26,442 --> 00:29:28,602
I'm looking at a peacock that has opened its wings.

423
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,162
And, it's facing its butt toward me.

424
00:29:31,295 --> 00:29:33,246
Why do you talk so harshly?

425
00:29:33,691 --> 00:29:36,452
People like you, who are boring, will never understand.

426
00:29:36,603 --> 00:29:38,980
Don't think that women don't care about a man's appearance.

427
00:29:39,083 --> 00:29:42,952
A man's neat and clean appearance is very important.

428
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:45,461
- Why don't you just not bother?   - Why?

429
00:29:45,587 --> 00:29:47,082
Why don't you just get plastic surgery?

430
00:29:47,163 --> 00:29:48,473
That's too expensive.

431
00:29:48,611 --> 00:29:49,611
You're right.

432
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,130
Why did you come to me?

433
00:29:55,718 --> 00:29:57,477
I have a friend.

434
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,138
I don't think you have friends.

435
00:29:59,473 --> 00:30:00,993
Well, just an old acquaintance.

436
00:30:01,213 --> 00:30:02,642
He's having some problems.

437
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,472
He once shared a house with someone

438
00:30:04,582 --> 00:30:06,302
and he complained about noise so he kicked her out.

439
00:30:06,491 --> 00:30:08,522
Now, for some reason, he has asked her to come back.

440
00:30:08,843 --> 00:30:09,867
It turns out it's not the reason.

441
00:30:09,948 --> 00:30:11,962
So, he wants to send her away again. Do you have any good ideas?

442
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:15,843
- Let her go by herself.   - She won't go.

443
00:30:17,266 --> 00:30:19,283
No. I'm here to find a solution with you.

444
00:30:19,363 --> 00:30:20,642
Let's not talk about solutions yet.

445
00:30:20,722 --> 00:30:21,723
Is your friend a normal person?

446
00:30:21,804 --> 00:30:24,047
- Of course.   - Can a normal person first send another away,

447
00:30:24,128 --> 00:30:25,962
then invite her back, and then kick her out again?

448
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,901
Is your friend the sun? Everyone has to revolve around him? Why? Who is he?

449
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:30,255
Is that right?

450
00:30:32,477 --> 00:30:33,602
Anything else?

451
00:30:33,771 --> 00:30:35,802
If there's nothing else, I'm going to have a calming tea

452
00:30:35,883 --> 00:30:36,962
and sleep a beauty sleep.

453
00:30:37,078 --> 00:30:39,162
Tomorrow, I'm going to go on a date with my goddess.

454
00:30:41,933 --> 00:30:44,453
Let me remind you. Stay away from friends like him.

455
00:30:44,573 --> 00:30:46,802
This kind of person is unreliable. He's so annoying.

456
00:31:04,573 --> 00:31:06,402
Why hasn't he come back yet?

457
00:31:07,803 --> 00:31:10,122
Could it be that he got scolded by his mom?

458
00:31:11,083 --> 00:31:12,922
His mom scolded him, and he scolded me.

459
00:31:13,387 --> 00:31:15,562
Then, because I'm in debt...

460
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,234
Boss. You're back.

461
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,682
Come on. I'll get you your slippers.

462
00:31:24,781 --> 00:31:27,361
The shoes are arranged according to your request, facing inward.

463
00:31:31,123 --> 00:31:32,402
Are you hungry?

464
00:31:32,498 --> 00:31:34,442
The supper is already prepared.

465
00:31:34,579 --> 00:31:36,042
All are organic.

466
00:31:36,211 --> 00:31:37,362
It's natural and healthy

467
00:31:37,477 --> 00:31:38,842
and easy to digest.

468
00:31:40,193 --> 00:31:41,562
Even home-cooked dishes need to be arranged.

469
00:31:41,643 --> 00:31:42,922
Are you too bored?

470
00:31:43,686 --> 00:31:45,482
Even though it's home-cooked food,

471
00:31:45,611 --> 00:31:47,562
we should be ceremonial.

472
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:49,842
Oh, right, boss.

473
00:31:50,013 --> 00:31:52,881
Your mom isn't mad because of the bodyguard thing, right?

474
00:31:52,962 --> 00:31:54,482
- No.   - That's good.

475
00:31:56,388 --> 00:31:57,388
Boss.

476
00:31:58,607 --> 00:32:01,428
Let's have some water. One cold, one hot.

477
00:32:01,584 --> 00:32:03,682
I've boiled the hot one with other mineral water.

478
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:05,909
If we use Kongyun, there will be mineral deposits.

479
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,362
I've prepared food in the fridge.

480
00:32:07,463 --> 00:32:08,783
I've removed all visible clutter too.

481
00:32:08,863 --> 00:32:11,442
I didn't touch your room. But, I wiped the door handle clean for you.

482
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:12,762
Take a look. Are there other requests?

483
00:32:12,861 --> 00:32:14,422
Cheng Yao. Why do you have to waste your time

484
00:32:14,506 --> 00:32:15,962
on something meaningless like this?

485
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:19,233
I have to think for you in every matter.

486
00:32:19,331 --> 00:32:22,042
I can't let you be distracted by such small matters.

487
00:32:22,131 --> 00:32:24,051
No need. Just keep your distance from me.

488
00:32:24,202 --> 00:32:26,762
Also, do only whatever I ask you to do in the future.

489
00:32:26,946 --> 00:32:28,202
Don't act clever.

490
00:32:28,692 --> 00:32:31,162
- And, you don't need to make supper anymore.   - Why?

491
00:32:31,257 --> 00:32:33,448
Is it because the supper I made is not tasty?

492
00:32:34,556 --> 00:32:36,626
No. You haven't even tried them.

493
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:40,639
Boss, if you have any other requests, you can just mention them.

494
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,402
I'm a particularly hardworking person.

495
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:44,722
Are you especially willing to suffer hardships?

496
00:32:45,442 --> 00:32:47,763
I'm a poor laborer, after all.

497
00:32:47,843 --> 00:32:50,042
Now, I'm also in debt for such a large amount.

498
00:32:50,272 --> 00:32:52,842
Every day, I'm so worried I can't eat or drink.

499
00:32:52,962 --> 00:32:54,913
At night, I toss and turn,

500
00:32:55,242 --> 00:32:56,882
afraid that if you're not happy,

501
00:32:56,962 --> 00:32:59,122
you'll double my debt.

502
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:01,227
Well, then I...

503
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:04,282
- Well, then I...   - Okay, I'm ordering you

504
00:33:04,426 --> 00:33:05,947
to disappear from my sight immediately.

505
00:33:06,043 --> 00:33:07,842
Don't appear in front of me except during work hours.

506
00:33:07,923 --> 00:33:09,162
Otherwise, the debt will double.

507
00:33:38,566 --> 00:33:39,842
Is this the place?

508
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,562
Come on. Let me through.

509
00:34:21,308 --> 00:34:22,699
Is this the place?

510
00:34:30,244 --> 00:34:31,484
What's wrong with you, young man?

511
00:34:31,617 --> 00:34:33,762
- You've bumped into me!   - Sorry.

512
00:34:35,713 --> 00:34:37,103
Thank you.

513
00:34:37,551 --> 00:34:39,442
- Thank you.   - Wu Jun.

514
00:35:12,828 --> 00:35:14,308
The suburbs are not like the city.

515
00:35:14,396 --> 00:35:16,722
But, their food is quite fresh. Have a taste.

516
00:35:16,911 --> 00:35:18,221
That's quite good.

517
00:35:18,802 --> 00:35:20,162
Don't you want to drink something?

518
00:35:20,767 --> 00:35:21,962
Let's have some wine then?

519
00:35:22,244 --> 00:35:23,305
Sure.

520
00:35:24,277 --> 00:35:25,277
Waiter.

521
00:35:25,588 --> 00:35:27,562
Bring a bottle of your most spirited wine.

522
00:35:27,643 --> 00:35:29,327
- Sure.   - Oh, you want to drink the most spirited one?

523
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,642
Let's have the most spirited wine.

524
00:35:30,723 --> 00:35:32,002
Noted. We'll serve you that.

525
00:35:32,083 --> 00:35:33,083
Thank you.

526
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:42,251
Have I changed a lot?

527
00:35:47,917 --> 00:35:49,835
No. You were at the market today, right?

528
00:35:49,916 --> 00:35:51,362
Weren't you wearing a hat?

529
00:35:51,492 --> 00:35:52,852
So, I didn't recognize you at first.

530
00:35:52,963 --> 00:35:54,142
Sorry about that.

531
00:35:54,967 --> 00:35:56,482
That grandma is over 80 years old.

532
00:35:56,563 --> 00:35:57,842
Her son doesn't support her.

533
00:35:58,123 --> 00:35:59,748
After I found out the situation,

534
00:35:59,829 --> 00:36:01,722
I helped her out by tidying up her things.

535
00:36:02,008 --> 00:36:03,042
You...

536
00:36:03,866 --> 00:36:05,012
Say it first.

537
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:07,191
- You go first.   - Okay, I'll say it.

538
00:36:08,631 --> 00:36:12,442
When we were in school, you really liked this chocolate brand, right?

539
00:36:12,523 --> 00:36:13,833
I just happened to buy it that day

540
00:36:14,013 --> 00:36:15,242
and brought it to you.

541
00:36:17,447 --> 00:36:18,722
Even though you weren't very strong,

542
00:36:18,862 --> 00:36:20,451
your memory was pretty good.

543
00:36:21,021 --> 00:36:22,402
I'm pretty strong.

544
00:36:22,966 --> 00:36:23,966
It's just that

545
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:26,413
it was too hot that day.

546
00:36:26,886 --> 00:36:27,886
Thank you.

547
00:36:30,407 --> 00:36:31,962
My memory is pretty good.

548
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:34,082
When it comes to you, I remember it all.

549
00:36:34,163 --> 00:36:35,602
I haven't forgotten a thing.

550
00:36:39,116 --> 00:36:40,866
Since you treated me to chocolate,

551
00:36:41,053 --> 00:36:42,763
I'll ask you to have a drink.

552
00:36:42,844 --> 00:36:43,844
Sure!

553
00:36:45,031 --> 00:36:46,031
Okay.

554
00:36:46,447 --> 00:36:48,282
This drink smells great.

555
00:36:48,363 --> 00:36:49,363
Really?

556
00:36:52,102 --> 00:36:53,642
Drink slowly.

557
00:36:53,749 --> 00:36:55,362
This is white wine.

558
00:36:57,612 --> 00:36:59,002
It's quite strong.

559
00:36:59,357 --> 00:37:00,496
What's the alcohol content?

560
00:37:06,132 --> 00:37:08,282
We haven't seen each other for so many years. Cheng Xi.

561
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:11,802
During all these years,

562
00:37:12,027 --> 00:37:14,402
you slowly faded out of the lawyer circle.

563
00:37:15,802 --> 00:37:18,793
I sent you emails. Have you seen them? Why don't you reply to me?

564
00:37:20,317 --> 00:37:21,516
Let me tell you, Cheng Xi.

565
00:37:21,659 --> 00:37:23,489
I'm doing quite well

566
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:25,059
at the law firm with Qian.

567
00:37:25,162 --> 00:37:27,358
Why don't you consider coming to join us?

568
00:37:27,439 --> 00:37:28,682
Let's work together.

569
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,569
But, I'm that kind of person.

570
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:33,338
With my bad reputation

571
00:37:33,847 --> 00:37:36,157
of cheating and fighting for property...

572
00:37:39,337 --> 00:37:44,404
Well, how many years have you, me, and Qian known each other?

573
00:37:44,485 --> 00:37:46,442
Can we not know the kind of character you have?

574
00:37:46,612 --> 00:37:48,762
We 100% believe in you.

575
00:37:49,241 --> 00:37:52,122
You would definitely not do things like cheating in marriage.

576
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:54,896
You definitely have your own unspeakable secrets.

577
00:37:54,977 --> 00:37:55,977
Right?

578
00:38:00,508 --> 00:38:03,967
So, when I see those malicious comments defaming you online,

579
00:38:04,076 --> 00:38:05,996
I will report them all. Every single one.

580
00:38:06,122 --> 00:38:10,393
Those people won't be able to comment online again. Yeah.

581
00:38:11,251 --> 00:38:12,402
Wu Jun.

582
00:38:12,755 --> 00:38:15,482
My life and work

583
00:38:15,603 --> 00:38:17,042
are quite peaceful now.

584
00:38:17,165 --> 00:38:18,835
I don't want anything to change.

585
00:38:21,326 --> 00:38:24,124
I'm still very thankful for the fact that you're helping Cheng Yao.

586
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:26,502
I'm helping Cheng Yao?

587
00:38:27,453 --> 00:38:28,453
No such thing!

588
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,211
How did you know about this?

589
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,696
Yao Yao is hardworking.

590
00:38:33,824 --> 00:38:35,984
- She has the potential to become a good lawyer.   - That's right.

591
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:37,842
But, she's as competitive as me.

592
00:38:37,947 --> 00:38:40,614
If she knew it was because of me that she got into Junheng,

593
00:38:40,786 --> 00:38:43,202
- she'd be sad.   - No. Wait a minute, Cheng Xi.

594
00:38:43,378 --> 00:38:45,482
I really think Cheng Yao is suitable to be a lawyer.

595
00:38:45,588 --> 00:38:48,222
Besides, didn't you just say that she has potential?

596
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,489
People with potential just need a good environment to grow, right?

597
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:53,162
That's what I mean.

598
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,811
Then, I'll toast to you on behalf of Cheng Yao.

599
00:38:57,339 --> 00:38:59,122
Thank you for giving her this good opportunity.

600
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:00,422
Cheers.

601
00:39:00,557 --> 00:39:01,557
Cheers.

602
00:39:05,022 --> 00:39:07,562
If you agree to come to Junheng, you can make any conditions you want.

603
00:39:07,663 --> 00:39:09,042
- All right.  - If you want to come...

604
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,402
Hurry up and eat. The dishes will get cold soon.

605
00:39:11,798 --> 00:39:13,197
- Okay.   - The meat is almost burnt.

606
00:39:13,278 --> 00:39:15,018
All right. I'll flip it now.

607
00:39:17,643 --> 00:39:18,902
Wait a minute.

608
00:39:20,105 --> 00:39:21,379
Turn on the light.

609
00:39:23,172 --> 00:39:24,522
Cheng Xi.

610
00:39:29,362 --> 00:39:31,162
Do you know that I regret it?

611
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,410
You don't know what I regret, right?

612
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,642
I...

613
00:39:36,723 --> 00:39:38,714
I regret that day...

614
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:44,453
Don't touch me.

615
00:39:44,534 --> 00:39:47,642
I'm dizzy. Sit down.

616
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:49,882
Sit down. Let me tell you.

617
00:39:53,501 --> 00:39:54,762
Tell you what?

618
00:39:54,843 --> 00:39:55,843
Tell you...

619
00:39:56,972 --> 00:39:58,162
That day...

620
00:39:58,341 --> 00:40:00,941
When I was running, if it wasn't so hot that I fainted,

621
00:40:01,022 --> 00:40:02,732
I would have confessed to you.

622
00:40:04,116 --> 00:40:05,796
At that time, if I had confessed to you,

623
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:08,162
that big fool Deng Ming would have nothing to do with you.

624
00:40:13,186 --> 00:40:14,362
Cheng Xi.

625
00:40:16,837 --> 00:40:18,882
You have always been in my heart.

626
00:40:19,296 --> 00:40:21,207
In my heart...

627
00:40:25,147 --> 00:40:28,378
When I saw Deng Ming bullying you online,

628
00:40:28,764 --> 00:40:30,242
I wanted to tear him apart.

629
00:40:30,397 --> 00:40:32,202
Do you know that? I want to tear him apart.

630
00:40:32,315 --> 00:40:34,242
How can he bully you?

631
00:40:35,764 --> 00:40:37,122
What gives him the right to do that?

632
00:40:38,556 --> 00:40:39,922
But, it's all right now.

633
00:40:40,549 --> 00:40:41,979
You don't have to be scared.

634
00:40:43,571 --> 00:40:45,682
I'm a capable person now.

635
00:40:46,234 --> 00:40:48,544
Junheng is established now.

636
00:40:49,669 --> 00:40:52,795
I have the confidence that I can protect you.

637
00:40:56,107 --> 00:40:57,778
I will avenge you.

638
00:40:57,964 --> 00:40:59,184
Believe me.

639
00:41:01,308 --> 00:41:03,538
I will avenge you.

640
00:41:04,885 --> 00:41:06,474
Do you believe me?

641
00:41:07,338 --> 00:41:08,962
I will avenge you.

642
00:41:09,763 --> 00:41:10,864
Wu Jun.

643
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,402
Thank you.

644
00:41:15,107 --> 00:41:16,362
You're welcome.

645
00:42:22,634 --> 00:42:24,304
What happened afterward?

646
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:42,322
That's the length of her hair.

647
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,581
The smell is right too.

648
00:42:54,837 --> 00:42:56,722
Oh, my Miss Right.

649
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,580
What's going on?

650
00:43:04,716 --> 00:43:06,522
This is such a happy and important moment.

651
00:43:06,603 --> 00:43:07,762
How dare you strike?

652
00:43:07,925 --> 00:43:09,658
I can't remember anything.

653
00:43:34,927 --> 00:43:36,482
What's the situation now?
