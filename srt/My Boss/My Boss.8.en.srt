1
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,762
(My Boss)

2
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,082
(Episode 8: Do I really look pretty when I cry?)

3
00:01:49,017 --> 00:01:50,642
No wonder she's a famous actress,

4
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:53,000
able to twist what's true and false with her acting skills.

5
00:01:53,024 --> 00:01:56,059
The Weibo post Xu Jun posted before his death is true.

6
00:01:58,173 --> 00:01:59,253
Director Zheng, thank you for letting me participate

7
00:01:59,277 --> 00:02:00,697
in The Legend of the Golden House.

8
00:02:00,778 --> 00:02:02,456
- No need to thank me. - I didn't expect

9
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,936
our viewership to exceed one billion.

10
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,414
And, also through Director Zheng, I got to know all of you.

11
00:02:06,495 --> 00:02:08,113
Thank you all, really. Thank you all.

12
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:10,042
- You're welcome. - Thank you.

13
00:02:10,134 --> 00:02:11,762
- Thank you. - Excuse me for a moment.

14
00:02:11,843 --> 00:02:13,482
- Okay. - You guys talk.

15
00:02:31,823 --> 00:02:33,969
At first, Bai Xing Meng disguised herself

16
00:02:34,066 --> 00:02:35,842
as gentle, virtuous, and generous.

17
00:02:36,207 --> 00:02:38,647
Xu Jun, as an engineering man with no love experience at all,

18
00:02:38,686 --> 00:02:40,442
quickly fell in love.

19
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:42,322
Xu Jun devoted himself to Bai Xing Meng.

20
00:02:42,856 --> 00:02:44,153
Xu Jun later found out

21
00:02:44,272 --> 00:02:45,879
that Bai Xing Meng was not interested in him,

22
00:02:45,903 --> 00:02:47,893
but his company, Tuantuan Online.

23
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,649
Bai Xing Meng didn't expect

24
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,250
that Xu Jun was not the only shareholder of Tuantuan Online.

25
00:02:52,351 --> 00:02:54,248
He was not as wealthy as she imagined.

26
00:02:54,337 --> 00:02:56,612
In the early stages of the business, the funds were tight.

27
00:02:56,636 --> 00:02:59,527
As the CEO, Xu Jun's life was also experiencing hardship.

28
00:02:59,682 --> 00:03:01,753
So, Bai Xing Meng revealed her true colors

29
00:03:01,943 --> 00:03:03,682
and changed her attitude toward Xu Jun.

30
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,280
She couldn't wait to get divorced.

31
00:03:06,448 --> 00:03:08,402
So, Bai Xing Meng's previous statement

32
00:03:08,483 --> 00:03:10,683
that Xu Jun was using her to hype up their relationship

33
00:03:10,831 --> 00:03:13,482
to help Tuantuan Online gain popularity was all lies.

34
00:03:13,563 --> 00:03:16,722
All these strategies were all planned by Bai Xing Meng.

35
00:03:17,023 --> 00:03:19,737
Xu Jun was still too naive in terms of relationships.

36
00:03:19,818 --> 00:03:22,242
Not naive, but too confident.

37
00:03:23,627 --> 00:03:26,082
Number 36.15 million.

38
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,495
He overestimated his own abilities

39
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:38,842
to use Bai Xing Meng's influence in getting Tuantuan Online listed

40
00:03:38,923 --> 00:03:41,002
while winning over her heart.

41
00:03:41,503 --> 00:03:46,529
If Bai Xing Meng scores an eight for using Xu Jun's depression,

42
00:03:46,784 --> 00:03:49,865
Xu Jun's calculations before and after marriage are worth seven and a half.

43
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:51,350
They are not much different.

44
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,262
Why did Bai Xing Meng do this?

45
00:03:53,343 --> 00:03:54,782
Of course, it's for her benefit.

46
00:03:55,095 --> 00:03:57,042
But she did not need to be so ruthless, right?

47
00:03:57,177 --> 00:03:58,857
If it's for money,

48
00:03:59,024 --> 00:04:01,562
Xu Jun had already promised to give her enough compensation.

49
00:04:01,993 --> 00:04:04,496
And, she could take advantage of Xu Jun wanting to get rid of

50
00:04:04,693 --> 00:04:06,242
the threat of going public

51
00:04:06,408 --> 00:04:08,893
to get more than what the court would've ruled.

52
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,608
Did she need to force him to death?

53
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,493
It's to help her new lover,

54
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,722
eliminate Tuantuan Online, his competitor.

55
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,339
If I publicly reveal the evidence I have,

56
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,190
it can restore the truth of the matter

57
00:04:21,023 --> 00:04:23,122
and help Yao Yao clear her name,

58
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:27,037
but I'm not their relative nor am I a party to this matter.

59
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,682
Based on my stance and professional ethics,

60
00:04:30,143 --> 00:04:31,943
- I... - Why do you want to make it public?

61
00:04:32,003 --> 00:04:33,474
What does it have to do with you?

62
00:04:34,561 --> 00:04:35,999
You asked me to be here.

63
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,361
Isn't it just to discuss this matter? To find a solution?

64
00:04:38,401 --> 00:04:39,894
Do I need to discuss it with you?

65
00:04:39,993 --> 00:04:42,282
Are you misunderstanding my professional ability?

66
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,280
The talk is done,

67
00:04:50,377 --> 00:04:51,537
and the drinks are finished.

68
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,900
You can go now.

69
00:04:58,646 --> 00:05:00,162
Why won't you be polite?

70
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,999
We are, after all, people in the same industry.

71
00:05:02,023 --> 00:05:03,682
There might be future collaborations.

72
00:05:03,818 --> 00:05:06,002
You need to maintain our relationships.

73
00:05:06,123 --> 00:05:08,882
What kind of relationships do I need to maintain with you?

74
00:05:11,035 --> 00:05:13,420
Okay. I'll buy the drinks.

75
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,722
Yao Yao. Let's go out without him next time.

76
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,020
I'm leaving first.

77
00:05:28,263 --> 00:05:30,522
- Bye. - Thank you, senior.

78
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,922
Thank you, boss.

79
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,120
- What are you thanking me for? - Thank you for letting me know

80
00:05:38,164 --> 00:05:39,764
that although I did something wrong,

81
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:41,479
it's not an unsolvable issue.

82
00:05:41,784 --> 00:05:43,144
Thank you for letting me know

83
00:05:43,225 --> 00:05:45,242
it wasn't me who pushed Xu Jun toward death.

84
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,922
I feel a bit better now.

85
00:05:50,376 --> 00:05:52,504
Do you really think that with a few harsh words,

86
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,385
you can force a young entrepreneur to death?

87
00:05:54,474 --> 00:05:56,074
You really think too highly of yourself.

88
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,659
But boss,

89
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,511
I actually think you have a warm heart.

90
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,720
You just talk harshly.

91
00:06:07,816 --> 00:06:10,256
You treasure your time and money.

92
00:06:10,424 --> 00:06:12,880
You even want to carve "ten-thousand hourly wage" on your forehead.

93
00:06:12,904 --> 00:06:15,048
But, you are willing to bring me here to help analyze the case

94
00:06:15,072 --> 00:06:16,273
and guide me.

95
00:06:16,354 --> 00:06:18,922
Although people outside say you are a tumor in the industry,

96
00:06:19,153 --> 00:06:22,602
actually, you just have higher standards for work, right?

97
00:06:27,184 --> 00:06:30,082
I remember the time when you became famous.

98
00:06:30,163 --> 00:06:32,882
You helped a cheating rich man win the lawsuit.

99
00:06:33,096 --> 00:06:34,791
So many people were cursing you at that time.

100
00:06:34,815 --> 00:06:37,486
Did you feel especially sympathetic toward me because of that?

101
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,322
Don't guess my intention.

102
00:06:39,544 --> 00:06:40,762
You are my employee.

103
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,130
If someone bullies you, it's like they are bullying me.

104
00:06:43,316 --> 00:06:45,202
When you leave, see if I still care about you.

105
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,802
- How did you get through it? - Get through it?

106
00:06:48,927 --> 00:06:51,520
That room was full of threatening letters and many people were cursing you.

107
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,723
Every time you wake up, don't you feel bad

108
00:06:53,804 --> 00:06:55,604
just thinking about the wrong things you did?

109
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,840
At that time, about the media reporting on that incident

110
00:06:58,904 --> 00:07:01,442
and those people who cursed me the most online,

111
00:07:02,184 --> 00:07:03,842
I collected evidence and sued them.

112
00:07:03,984 --> 00:07:05,122
Thanks to them,

113
00:07:05,304 --> 00:07:07,825
I was able to get more than 600,000 in settlement compensation.

114
00:07:07,906 --> 00:07:10,667
That's how Junheng got the capital in the early days of the business.

115
00:07:10,904 --> 00:07:13,364
Boss, you are worthy of the surname Qian.

116
00:07:13,445 --> 00:07:15,780
Qian Heng means "money is eternal."

117
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,282
Enough. No more flattery. Go and pay the bill.

118
00:07:23,683 --> 00:07:26,354
Weren't you the one who asked me out for drinks? Why am I paying?

119
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,439
I asked you out for drinks.

120
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:29,950
Did I say I'd treat you?

121
00:07:30,707 --> 00:07:32,162
I didn't even take a sip.

122
00:07:36,176 --> 00:07:38,402
As expected, there's no such thing as a free lunch.

123
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,633
I just talked to you for half an hour.

124
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,760
Including the round trip, that's an hour in total.

125
00:07:45,122 --> 00:07:46,562
Based on my hourly rate,

126
00:07:46,703 --> 00:07:48,747
to have you pay for the drinks is considered a 90% discount.

127
00:07:48,771 --> 00:07:50,071
Are you moved?

128
00:07:52,184 --> 00:07:53,962
- Do you have a driver's license? - Yes.

129
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,550
Do you want me to drive your luxury car, don't you?

130
00:07:58,856 --> 00:08:00,128
I haven't even driven on the road yet.

131
00:08:00,152 --> 00:08:01,711
Let's just call a driver. I'm scared.

132
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:02,842
A driver?

133
00:08:04,134 --> 00:08:05,267
At this time?

134
00:08:05,348 --> 00:08:07,111
It should take an hour to call a driver.

135
00:08:07,192 --> 00:08:09,682
Are you sure you want to pay for my hour?

136
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:25,641
Cheng Yao.

137
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:28,442
The one riding the electric motorcycle has surpassed us.

138
00:08:28,546 --> 00:08:29,722
Really?

139
00:08:30,735 --> 00:08:33,176
Electric motorcycles are quite powerful now.

140
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,162
They've already achieved acceleration in one second.

141
00:08:42,774 --> 00:08:45,034
The one riding the bicycle has already surpassed us.

142
00:08:45,594 --> 00:08:46,702
Boss,

143
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,362
people who ride bicycles all year round

144
00:08:49,575 --> 00:08:52,061
have muscles and explosive power at the highest level.

145
00:08:57,473 --> 00:08:59,002
Explain to me

146
00:08:59,576 --> 00:09:02,373
how this jogger has surpassed us.

147
00:09:04,606 --> 00:09:07,802
It is a 10-minute journey, and you have been driving for 20 minutes now.

148
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,882
Are you planning to sleep in the car with me?

149
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,669
Boss, aren't you going to check what kind of car this is?

150
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:16,602
Don't I need to be careful?

151
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,656
What if it gets scratched or bumps into something?

152
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,202
I can't afford to pay for it. Right?

153
00:09:22,376 --> 00:09:23,655
Plus, it's raining.

154
00:09:23,743 --> 00:09:24,832
Safety first.

155
00:09:24,924 --> 00:09:26,224
Safety first.

156
00:09:37,517 --> 00:09:38,642
Cheng Yao.

157
00:09:39,063 --> 00:09:40,762
What have you bought so much online?

158
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,562
- It's all mine? - It's all yours.

159
00:09:45,728 --> 00:09:47,282
I didn't buy anything.

160
00:09:47,528 --> 00:09:49,387
It's all written with your name.

161
00:09:49,504 --> 00:09:50,659
That's right. Your name is written on it.

162
00:09:50,683 --> 00:09:52,964
Cheng. You're the only one with this surname in the firm.

163
00:09:53,155 --> 00:09:54,545
You didn't buy anything?

164
00:09:54,626 --> 00:09:57,442
So, is someone secretly in love with you? Maybe he sent you a gift.

165
00:10:00,464 --> 00:10:01,789
- Is today Valentine's Day? - Let's open it and see.

166
00:10:01,813 --> 00:10:02,896
Let's open it.

167
00:10:14,473 --> 00:10:15,823
What is this?

168
00:10:16,013 --> 00:10:17,482
Who is so childish?

169
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,750
This scared me.

170
00:10:38,302 --> 00:10:40,282
Don't open it. It affects our mood.

171
00:10:40,363 --> 00:10:42,082
It's all a foolish, low-level trick.

172
00:10:43,707 --> 00:10:45,840
- Give it to me. I'll take care of it. - Throw it away.

173
00:10:45,864 --> 00:10:48,424
- I'll take care of it. The boss always gets these. - No need.

174
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:49,949
This is fine.

175
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,322
The boss has received even more outrageous things before.

176
00:10:53,466 --> 00:10:54,786
We have to keep them as evidence.

177
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:56,082
Oh, Cheng Yao.

178
00:10:56,201 --> 00:10:57,752
You sound a bit like Lawyer Qian now.

179
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,922
Don't look anymore. Leave it to us.

180
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,030
Don't worry. We have experience dealing with these.

181
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,670
I'm going to call my sister.

182
00:11:19,322 --> 00:11:21,638
(Sister)

183
00:11:27,218 --> 00:11:29,002
(Sister)

184
00:11:33,049 --> 00:11:34,174
Cheng Xi.

185
00:11:34,286 --> 00:11:35,676
Yao Yao, are you okay?

186
00:11:36,311 --> 00:11:38,162
(Have you received anything?)

187
00:11:38,424 --> 00:11:39,602
Nope.

188
00:11:39,743 --> 00:11:41,133
Did you send something to me?

189
00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:45,118
Then, why did you call me?

190
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,799
I'm fine now.

191
00:11:47,936 --> 00:11:49,487
My classmate fell asleep.

192
00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:51,575
I called you just to tell you this.

193
00:11:51,655 --> 00:11:53,562
You work late every day.

194
00:11:53,849 --> 00:11:55,503
(So, remember to eat breakfast, okay?)

195
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,263
(Otherwise, your health will be affected.)

196
00:11:58,223 --> 00:11:59,562
Don't worry, I already ate.

197
00:11:59,684 --> 00:12:00,922
Oh, right.

198
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,823
I bought tickets for a drama this weekend.

199
00:12:03,927 --> 00:12:05,482
After you return, let's go together.

200
00:12:06,471 --> 00:12:08,391
Why do we have activities every weekend?

201
00:12:08,606 --> 00:12:10,922
It's the weekend, so we have to have fun, right?

202
00:12:12,911 --> 00:12:14,414
And, about Wei Zhen Tian, it is very obedient.

203
00:12:14,438 --> 00:12:16,082
I'll send you a photo in a bit.

204
00:12:17,024 --> 00:12:18,185
Okay. You go ahead and work.

205
00:12:18,266 --> 00:12:19,322
I'm hanging up.

206
00:12:19,403 --> 00:12:20,703
(Yao Yao.)

207
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,522
If you have any difficulties at work, you must tell me, okay?

208
00:12:27,656 --> 00:12:28,722
(Got it?)

209
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,682
Got it.

210
00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:42,562
(Cheng Xi, don't worry.)

211
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:43,922
(I'll be strong.)

212
00:12:44,762 --> 00:12:46,130
(It's Lawyer Cheng that caused the death of Tuantuan Online's CEO.)

213
00:12:46,154 --> 00:12:47,834
(Her sister had a scandal before as well.)

214
00:12:48,792 --> 00:12:50,209
(Junheng & Co)

215
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,682
(Deng Ming)

216
00:13:02,855 --> 00:13:04,163
(I'm in the hospital.)

217
00:13:04,244 --> 00:13:05,595
(Mom wants to see you.)

218
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:11,317
(Deng Ming)

219
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:16,082
(Xi. Really, we're so in sync.)

220
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:17,690
(I was just talking to Mom about you)

221
00:13:17,817 --> 00:13:19,176
(and you called right away.)

222
00:13:19,287 --> 00:13:21,122
(Come, say hi to Mom. Come on.)

223
00:13:21,227 --> 00:13:22,527
(Xi.)

224
00:13:22,722 --> 00:13:25,105
(I heard from Ming that you're on a business trip.)

225
00:13:25,186 --> 00:13:26,602
(You must have worked hard.)

226
00:13:26,823 --> 00:13:28,983
(You should take good care of yourself.)

227
00:13:29,152 --> 00:13:30,322
Mom, I'm fine.

228
00:13:30,474 --> 00:13:31,903
How are you feeling?

229
00:13:32,703 --> 00:13:34,762
(Me? Just like this.)

230
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,162
(I'm just hoping that you and Ming can have a baby soon, )

231
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,802
(so I can hold it.)

232
00:13:40,896 --> 00:13:43,162
(Okay, Mom. Don't worry.)

233
00:13:43,652 --> 00:13:46,584
(Xi and I are already planning to have a baby.)

234
00:13:46,664 --> 00:13:47,964
(Take care of your health.)

235
00:13:48,082 --> 00:13:49,602
(I'll talk to Xi for a while.)

236
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:51,202
(Xi, how are you?)

237
00:13:51,301 --> 00:13:52,722
(Have you adapted well?)

238
00:13:52,943 --> 00:13:54,002
(Are you okay?)

239
00:13:54,152 --> 00:13:55,722
(Mom is missing you.)

240
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,722
Thank you. Really.

241
00:14:04,918 --> 00:14:07,074
Deng Ming, you've re-married for so long. Still hiding it from your mom?

242
00:14:07,098 --> 00:14:09,469
- Aren't you tired? - I have no choice.

243
00:14:09,605 --> 00:14:11,442
Mom loves you so much.

244
00:14:11,846 --> 00:14:13,159
(If I tell Mom now, )

245
00:14:13,255 --> 00:14:15,562
I'm afraid her body won't be able to take it.

246
00:14:16,766 --> 00:14:18,002
Xi,

247
00:14:18,455 --> 00:14:19,898
can you help me with one more thing?

248
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,482
Mom is having major surgery in two days.

249
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:24,792
Can you come over and see her?

250
00:14:24,873 --> 00:14:26,173
Give her some encouragement.

251
00:14:26,384 --> 00:14:28,824
Yao Yao was bullied online. Was it your doing?

252
00:14:29,072 --> 00:14:31,599
(Doing that, you still have the nerve to ask me for help?)

253
00:14:31,764 --> 00:14:32,943
Yao Yao was bullied online?

254
00:14:33,024 --> 00:14:34,534
(Who bullied Yao?)

255
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:36,328
This must be a misunderstanding.

256
00:14:36,441 --> 00:14:38,402
(It's like this. I'm suing Junheng.)

257
00:14:38,483 --> 00:14:43,242
But, I really don't know what's going on with Yao Yao and Qian Heng's team.

258
00:14:43,323 --> 00:14:44,825
I'll investigate it for you.

259
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,005
Will that be okay? Rest assured.

260
00:14:46,029 --> 00:14:47,342
(I'll definitely give you an explanation.)

261
00:14:47,366 --> 00:14:48,482
Deng Ming.

262
00:14:49,023 --> 00:14:50,583
I'll visit your mom before her surgery.

263
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,722
That's because she's been really nice to me.

264
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:55,233
As for you, reflect on yourself.

265
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:58,065
Alas, the old woman has a son like you. It's really pitiful.

266
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,562
I've prepared my mood. Why don't you let me act?

267
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,900
You do this every day.

268
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:16,442
Xi. No need for that. You...

269
00:15:16,569 --> 00:15:20,122
You just got your job transferred. You don't need to take leave.

270
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,131
What? The leave has been taken? All right then.

271
00:15:25,212 --> 00:15:26,802
Then, I'll tell you the address.

272
00:15:26,901 --> 00:15:27,922
Qian Heng.

273
00:15:28,864 --> 00:15:31,231
- Listen to me. - Be quiet. I have already decided on this.

274
00:15:31,255 --> 00:15:32,555
No room for discussion.

275
00:15:33,272 --> 00:15:34,352
I have never begged you before.

276
00:15:34,376 --> 00:15:36,905
This time, I'm begging you. Can you raise your margin of error?

277
00:15:37,042 --> 00:15:39,152
- Aren't you worried about your reputation? - I'm not.

278
00:15:39,176 --> 00:15:40,762
I can't bear this person.

279
00:15:42,312 --> 00:15:44,992
If you're doing this, how am I supposed to face Cheng Xi afterward?

280
00:15:45,504 --> 00:15:48,014
Wu Jun. Has your brain been eaten by zombies?

281
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,875
Is there anyone like you who loves and protects even her ex-husband?

282
00:15:51,424 --> 00:15:53,544
What ex-husband? Who wants to protect her ex-husband?

283
00:15:54,045 --> 00:15:56,605
You said you can't bear this person. Aren't you referring to Cheng Yao?

284
00:15:56,629 --> 00:15:58,842
Brother. I'm talking about Deng Ming.

285
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,561
Then, yes, you should have stopped me.

286
00:16:02,585 --> 00:16:03,945
I'll run faster than you from him.

287
00:16:06,743 --> 00:16:09,597
I have listened to all the recordings and read all the emails

288
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:10,959
between you and Bai Xing Meng.

289
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,931
She clearly stated

290
00:16:13,012 --> 00:16:15,812
that she would never settle and would reject Xu Jun's proposal. Right?

291
00:16:16,077 --> 00:16:17,617
But, if it is combined with other chains of evidence,

292
00:16:17,641 --> 00:16:19,409
it can completely prove that our firm's lawyers

293
00:16:19,433 --> 00:16:22,538
were just faithfully executing the client's agency request

294
00:16:22,619 --> 00:16:25,722
and not making decisions on our own.

295
00:16:26,896 --> 00:16:29,440
So, Bai Xing Meng's statement is not true.

296
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,991
But, she has affected our lawyers' reputation.

297
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,606
She must pay the lawyer's fee in full

298
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:37,042
and apologize for the impact she has caused us.

299
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:39,202
I've prepared the lawyer's letter. Take a look.

300
00:16:43,525 --> 00:16:44,842
I have also written one.

301
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,682
You are quite fast.

302
00:16:48,937 --> 00:16:51,257
So, you send out a statement first,

303
00:16:51,392 --> 00:16:54,322
saying Bai Xing Meng's case is all handled by me alone.

304
00:16:54,528 --> 00:16:57,117
I'm the one who makes the decisions about the case.

305
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,669
Other lawyers just carry out the orders

306
00:16:58,693 --> 00:17:00,282
and then start the litigation process.

307
00:17:00,824 --> 00:17:02,443
Qian, I must thank you for this.

308
00:17:02,524 --> 00:17:05,364
I'll definitely treat you to a drinking session when I have the chance.

309
00:17:06,887 --> 00:17:08,002
50,000 yuan.

310
00:17:10,649 --> 00:17:13,402
Wait. Why do I need to pay you after working for you?

311
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,420
I just don't want Junheng's reputation to be damaged.

312
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,081
Actually, firing Cheng Yao is also an option.

313
00:17:18,105 --> 00:17:20,458
We can say Cheng Yao acted on her own. It has nothing to do with Junheng.

314
00:17:20,482 --> 00:17:21,722
This plan is simpler.

315
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,956
Don't do this, brother.

316
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:26,151
It's all a misunderstanding.

317
00:17:26,263 --> 00:17:27,487
You're strong.

318
00:17:27,568 --> 00:17:28,800
You take the damage.

319
00:17:28,884 --> 00:17:30,354
I take the damage?

320
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:32,863
I be the bad guy?

321
00:17:32,943 --> 00:17:36,962
And you? You can face Dang Ming in court and help Cheng Xi vent her anger.

322
00:17:37,104 --> 00:17:38,499
At the same time, you can protect Cheng Yao,

323
00:17:38,523 --> 00:17:40,003
taking credit in front of her sister.

324
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:42,167
Taking 50,000 from you is already a big discount.

325
00:17:42,248 --> 00:17:44,402
Let's put the 50,000 aside for now.

326
00:17:47,629 --> 00:17:49,442
You should go check on Cheng Yao first.

327
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,917
This matter involves Cheng Xi.

328
00:17:51,044 --> 00:17:53,764
It must be more difficult for her than herself being bullied online.

329
00:17:54,263 --> 00:17:55,813
Why don't you go yourself?

330
00:17:55,978 --> 00:17:57,447
I have something to do.

331
00:17:57,971 --> 00:18:00,202
Besides, you're experienced in being bullied online.

332
00:18:00,283 --> 00:18:01,722
When you experienced that before,

333
00:18:01,794 --> 00:18:03,543
didn't I accompany you for a drink?

334
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,802
I'm really busy. I have to deliver this lawyer's letter in person.

335
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,800
Honey.

336
00:18:28,881 --> 00:18:31,762
This time, the hairpiece doesn't seem to be as natural as before.

337
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,640
Choose the one you chose before, all right?

338
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,263
Do you have an appointment? No appointment, no entry.

339
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,762
Our boss said he's very busy. Appointments are a must.

340
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,842
Wait. Don't make things difficult for me.

341
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:46,042
Uncle.

342
00:18:46,856 --> 00:18:47,882
Boss.

343
00:18:55,856 --> 00:18:58,029
I told you this painter is not good.

344
00:18:58,134 --> 00:18:59,614
He made you look fat in the painting.

345
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:05,282
Lawyer Wu, you came from far away just to see my portrait?

346
00:19:06,743 --> 00:19:08,181
(Lawyer's Letter)

347
00:19:08,262 --> 00:19:09,642
What do you want?

348
00:19:09,761 --> 00:19:12,165
I'm suing you for maliciously defaming Junheng

349
00:19:12,246 --> 00:19:13,722
and Junheng's employees.

350
00:19:13,935 --> 00:19:15,042
Sue me?

351
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,472
But, my client was just saying what she knows. That's all.

352
00:19:19,656 --> 00:19:23,402
What the spectators would think is not up to us.

353
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:25,745
It has nothing to do with my client.

354
00:19:25,841 --> 00:19:28,041
I know you are a master of manipulating public opinion.

355
00:19:28,736 --> 00:19:30,258
Is it malicious in the end?

356
00:19:30,353 --> 00:19:31,903
We'll know when we go to court, right?

357
00:19:33,395 --> 00:19:36,216
Lawyer Deng. You are the one with the Golden Scale Award.

358
00:19:36,424 --> 00:19:39,136
You won't be afraid and not show up in court, right?

359
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:41,733
I'm worried about you. I'm afraid you can't afford to lose.

360
00:19:42,286 --> 00:19:43,926
I really like your stubbornness.

361
00:19:44,007 --> 00:19:45,162
All right, I'm leaving.

362
00:19:49,864 --> 00:19:52,638
Although I'm really annoyed with you, I still want to tell you this.

363
00:19:54,456 --> 00:19:55,797
Don't always save money.

364
00:19:55,878 --> 00:19:57,270
The technology is very advanced now.

365
00:19:57,294 --> 00:19:58,883
Why don't you get a hair transplant?

366
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,070
That hairpiece looks so fake.

367
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,242
What a piece of junk. The color doesn't even match.

368
00:20:13,334 --> 00:20:14,362
Xi.

369
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:16,593
Xi.

370
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:17,802
Come here.

371
00:20:17,993 --> 00:20:19,020
Uncle.

372
00:20:19,101 --> 00:20:20,242
Who let him in?

373
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:21,897
I couldn't stop him.

374
00:20:24,633 --> 00:20:27,122
Wait. I dropped the hairpiece. You didn't remind me.

375
00:20:27,217 --> 00:20:28,846
I didn't notice.

376
00:20:29,816 --> 00:20:31,802
Oh, this is so annoying.

377
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,402
You do this every day.

378
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:38,162
Junheng wouldn't start a big fight with us for a small employee.

379
00:20:38,292 --> 00:20:40,082
It must be because of Aunt.

380
00:20:42,105 --> 00:20:43,427
No. I mean,

381
00:20:43,523 --> 00:20:44,682
Ex-aunt.

382
00:20:48,337 --> 00:20:49,722
Xi.

383
00:20:50,104 --> 00:20:53,380
I'm finding out more and more that you are really smart.

384
00:20:53,655 --> 00:20:55,002
Is that right?

385
00:20:56,209 --> 00:21:00,192
You're so smart that being my assistant is a bit of a waste.

386
00:21:00,503 --> 00:21:02,726
Oh, Uncle. I want to get promoted.

387
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:05,482
Is that right? So, do you want to ascend to heaven as well?

388
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:09,694
Are you too free?

389
00:21:10,391 --> 00:21:11,691
Go do some work.

390
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,020
You're ignorant.

391
00:21:17,145 --> 00:21:18,184
So,

392
00:21:18,287 --> 00:21:20,720
about me and your aunt, your grandma doesn't know, all right?

393
00:21:20,744 --> 00:21:22,044
Don't tell your parents.

394
00:21:22,584 --> 00:21:24,802
Don't worry, Uncle. I can keep secrets.

395
00:21:28,404 --> 00:21:29,842
(Lawyer's Letter)

396
00:21:38,058 --> 00:21:39,257
I'm leaving. It's time to get off work.

397
00:21:39,281 --> 00:21:40,522
- Bye. - Bye.

398
00:21:40,688 --> 00:21:41,988
What should we eat tonight?

399
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,436
(Evil Lawyer)

400
00:21:51,762 --> 00:21:53,197
I told you already.

401
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:55,482
Don't take this case. But you didn't listen to me.

402
00:21:58,609 --> 00:21:59,722
Look at the situation now.

403
00:21:59,864 --> 00:22:01,082
Before we could open the law firm,

404
00:22:01,106 --> 00:22:03,306
our name has already tarnished like rats on the street.

405
00:22:04,064 --> 00:22:05,842
Rats? What's wrong with rats?

406
00:22:06,087 --> 00:22:07,927
It's the rats' tenacity that keeps them alive.

407
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,550
I'm that indestructible little

408
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,142
rat.

409
00:22:13,223 --> 00:22:15,122
Qian Heng, are you childish or what?

410
00:22:15,295 --> 00:22:17,175
You have already been trending on the internet.

411
00:22:17,227 --> 00:22:19,179
Even if you have great tenacity, you are still a person.

412
00:22:19,203 --> 00:22:21,282
You will get vulnerable sometimes, understand?

413
00:22:21,824 --> 00:22:24,082
The law emphasizes procedural justice.

414
00:22:25,986 --> 00:22:28,709
When did it become public opinion judgment?

415
00:22:42,357 --> 00:22:45,282
(Bao Rui. Change tonight's consultation to tomorrow night.)

416
00:23:04,881 --> 00:23:05,922
Who is it?

417
00:23:07,391 --> 00:23:09,722
It's me. Who else did you think it was?

418
00:23:10,748 --> 00:23:12,097
You scared me.

419
00:23:12,361 --> 00:23:13,661
I thought...

420
00:23:17,256 --> 00:23:18,556
Thought what?

421
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,270
Weren't you going to meet the Austrian client?

422
00:23:25,305 --> 00:23:26,482
The client had to cancel.

423
00:23:26,563 --> 00:23:27,682
Go and cook.

424
00:23:28,231 --> 00:23:29,944
I thought you weren't coming back for dinner.

425
00:23:29,968 --> 00:23:31,368
I didn't buy groceries today.

426
00:23:32,264 --> 00:23:34,293
Okay. Let's go buy groceries.

427
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,322
Can we not cook today? Boss.

428
00:23:38,741 --> 00:23:40,442
There's no "discussion" in my dictionary.

429
00:23:40,523 --> 00:23:41,602
Let's go.

430
00:24:13,826 --> 00:24:15,963
Why are you causing troubles? I'm here to get groceries.

431
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:18,748
You just touched me four times. You have committed sexual harassment.

432
00:24:18,795 --> 00:24:21,141
Who touched you? You blocked the way and won't even let me get my things.

433
00:24:21,165 --> 00:24:24,358
Sorry. My friend often gets sexually harassed.

434
00:24:24,439 --> 00:24:25,802
Don't bother him.

435
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,402
Seriously?

436
00:24:30,483 --> 00:24:31,642
Sorry.

437
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,442
I always get sexually harassed?

438
00:24:37,784 --> 00:24:40,082
These aunties are really strong. Forget it.

439
00:24:40,242 --> 00:24:41,379
Are they stronger than me?

440
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,539
- Why snatch stuff? It's mine. - Who said it was yours?

441
00:24:43,563 --> 00:24:46,283
- You're twisting words and logic. - Whoever sees it is the owner.

442
00:24:56,819 --> 00:24:59,021
Unexpectedly, even the tumor in the legal industry

443
00:24:59,102 --> 00:25:00,689
will have a day of being defeated.

444
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,722
Do you have any snacks you like?

445
00:25:08,783 --> 00:25:10,602
I don't know what you like to eat.

446
00:25:10,841 --> 00:25:13,962
But I like mustard-flavored lotus root chips,

447
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:16,562
crab roe fish slices, and white peach flavored ginseng water,

448
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,722
and black garlic. They all taste great.

449
00:25:19,175 --> 00:25:21,080
What a coincidence. Let's get a bit of each then.

450
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:23,042
- All of them? - I coincidentally like them.

451
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,562
This guy looks rich.

452
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,829
That girl in front looks a bit crafty.

453
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,602
Let me do it.

454
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,580
Three more rainbow candies.

455
00:26:09,676 --> 00:26:10,802
Okay.

456
00:26:14,803 --> 00:26:16,403
(Why are his tastes so similar to mine?)

457
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,762
Thank you.

458
00:26:24,317 --> 00:26:25,617
Let me carry it.

459
00:26:25,766 --> 00:26:28,522
No need. I'm afraid you'll break my snacks.

460
00:26:38,384 --> 00:26:39,623
You don't need to cook.

461
00:26:39,703 --> 00:26:41,003
I don't want to eat.

462
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,242
Then, have some snacks and candied chestnuts.

463
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,700
I don't want to eat now.

464
00:27:00,403 --> 00:27:01,700
Then, I'll put them in the fridge.

465
00:27:01,724 --> 00:27:03,081
When you eat tomorrow morning,

466
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,751
I'll warm up the candied chestnuts.

467
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,802
I don't eat leftovers either. You can throw it away.

468
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,549
That would be such a waste.

469
00:27:11,537 --> 00:27:13,562
If you don't want it, I'll eat it.

470
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,620
Eat it all then.

471
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:22,282
If you don't like it, just throw it away.

472
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,280
It was bought with money. Throwing it away would be a waste.

473
00:27:27,006 --> 00:27:28,082
I don't mind.

474
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:36,681
If you want to cry, just cry.

475
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:47,042
The way you hold back your tears is ugly.

476
00:29:26,958 --> 00:29:28,848
I'm already so sad.

477
00:29:29,007 --> 00:29:30,602
You still say I'm ugly.

478
00:29:30,777 --> 00:29:32,107
Normally, at this time,

479
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,842
people would pretend to be polite and say something nice.

480
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,480
You already said that.

481
00:29:38,561 --> 00:29:39,861
That's what normal people do.

482
00:29:43,327 --> 00:29:45,162
How more vicious can you be?

483
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,242
Oh, sure I can.

484
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,722
This handkerchief is a limited edition I brought back from abroad,

485
00:29:50,842 --> 00:29:51,882
worth 8,000 yuan.

486
00:29:54,568 --> 00:29:56,768
You gave me this handkerchief, and I didn't ask for it.

487
00:29:58,362 --> 00:29:59,482
Why aren't you crying?

488
00:29:59,568 --> 00:30:01,482
If crying will cost me 8,000 yuan,

489
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,242
I'd rather not cry, all right?

490
00:30:09,132 --> 00:30:11,943
As my subordinate, you don't even have the ability to tell the difference.

491
00:30:11,967 --> 00:30:13,517
Can't you tell it's a knockoff?

492
00:30:21,722 --> 00:30:22,802
Cheng Yao.

493
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:25,834
Pretty.

494
00:30:25,915 --> 00:30:27,202
What does that mean?

495
00:30:27,303 --> 00:30:29,322
You should know your limits. I said you're pretty.

496
00:30:31,928 --> 00:30:33,210
What's the use of being pretty?

497
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:35,722
I've still been fooled by an even prettier woman.

498
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,629
As a lawyer, a big brain is better than a pretty face.

499
00:30:44,748 --> 00:30:47,562
But, having one is better than having none at all.

500
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,644
Are you

501
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:54,087
comforting me or mocking me?

502
00:30:58,841 --> 00:30:59,962
Forget it.

503
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,039
Thank you, boss. I'm going back to the room.

504
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,322
Wait a minute.

505
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:12,869
Thank you, boss.

506
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,882
(Forget it. Let's not disturb her.)

507
00:31:36,191 --> 00:31:37,682
(Let her vent it out.)

508
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:28,719
(Deal with the online bullying by Bai Xing Meng's fans now.)

509
00:32:28,743 --> 00:32:31,583
(Before work tomorrow morning, I don't want to see any traces of that.)

510
00:32:49,861 --> 00:32:52,642
(Lawyer's Letter)

511
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,362
Although his methods are a bit rough,

512
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,270
they're still very useful.

513
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,272
After crying today, tomorrow, I'll remain strong.

514
00:33:13,136 --> 00:33:14,656
Let me expel all the emotional toxins.

515
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,042
This movie is too touching.

516
00:33:36,173 --> 00:33:38,882
Let me cry a bit more and expel all the emotional toxins.

517
00:33:57,142 --> 00:33:59,438
Have you heard that the boss issued a statement

518
00:33:59,576 --> 00:34:00,816
bearing all the responsibility?

519
00:34:00,874 --> 00:34:04,042
And, he organized the public relations team to counter-attack overnight.

520
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,790
I have to say the boss is really nice to Cheng Yao.

521
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,698
Yu Fei's judgment is really good.

522
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,697
I just said the boss treats her differently.

523
00:34:10,721 --> 00:34:12,718
I didn't say in which way. I'm responsible for my words.

524
00:34:12,742 --> 00:34:14,615
I'm not responsible for your words. Understand?

525
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,350
It's really different.

526
00:34:17,063 --> 00:34:18,263
But, it doesn't look romantic.

527
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,640
It looks more like parental love.

528
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,686
Cheng Yao, good morning.

529
00:34:23,767 --> 00:34:24,926
Good morning.

530
00:34:26,347 --> 00:34:27,647
Have you checked your Weibo?

531
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,529
I'm afraid to. It's all people cursing me.

532
00:34:30,761 --> 00:34:32,382
It's okay. Let's take a look again.

533
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,882
Just look.

534
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,390
- Just take a look. - Just look.

535
00:34:47,496 --> 00:34:49,296
Why are they all apologizing to me?

536
00:34:49,428 --> 00:34:52,720
And, it's those Bai Xing Meng's fans who cursed you the most fervently.

537
00:34:52,801 --> 00:34:54,922
They publicly apologized to you as a group.

538
00:34:55,264 --> 00:34:57,538
This is a big slap in their face.

539
00:34:57,619 --> 00:34:59,762
What's their brain for if they just believe whatever they listen?

540
00:34:59,786 --> 00:35:00,906
Yeah.

541
00:35:01,135 --> 00:35:02,762
Why did they suddenly apologize?

542
00:35:02,904 --> 00:35:04,223
The boss took action himself.

543
00:35:04,343 --> 00:35:05,343
Haven't you heard?

544
00:35:05,423 --> 00:35:07,639
The boss is the law of the land. He can manage anything.

545
00:35:07,663 --> 00:35:09,743
Who would dare to rebel? That would take a lot of guts.

546
00:35:09,767 --> 00:35:11,739
We're suing Bai Xing Meng. The evidence has been gathered.

547
00:35:11,763 --> 00:35:14,723
It'll be submitted to the court this afternoon. Junheng must be respected!

548
00:35:15,278 --> 00:35:16,578
Wow, nice poem!

549
00:35:17,303 --> 00:35:18,779
The boss took action himself?

550
00:35:18,865 --> 00:35:20,922
This is the fastest case I've seen the boss handle.

551
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:23,032
Will you die from speaking properly?

552
00:35:23,137 --> 00:35:24,162
Single rhyme, wow.

553
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,908
So, the boss handled this case really quickly,

554
00:35:27,989 --> 00:35:29,869
faster than those cases worth billions of yuan.

555
00:35:30,131 --> 00:35:31,746
For those people who scolded you the most fervently,

556
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:33,758
the boss drafted the lawyer's letter overnight last night

557
00:35:33,782 --> 00:35:34,839
and sent an electronic version.

558
00:35:34,863 --> 00:35:37,353
The paper version was sent out this morning and delivered on the same day.

559
00:35:37,377 --> 00:35:38,457
They'll be scared to death.

560
00:35:38,538 --> 00:35:39,722
Do you not need to work?

561
00:35:44,326 --> 00:35:45,888
Boss, actually just now, we were praising you

562
00:35:45,912 --> 00:35:47,043
for being good to your subordinates.

563
00:35:47,067 --> 00:35:48,307
We want Cheng Yao to be able to

564
00:35:48,363 --> 00:35:50,203
dedicate herself to our law firm to her death.

565
00:35:50,263 --> 00:35:53,282
Oh, no need to die, just dedicate herself.

566
00:35:58,064 --> 00:35:59,364
Boss, good morning.

567
00:36:02,227 --> 00:36:04,414
Don't let me see you guys chatting again.

568
00:36:06,404 --> 00:36:08,886
(Cheng Yao, everyone is so concerned about you.)

569
00:36:09,077 --> 00:36:11,042
(You can't keep holding them back.)

570
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,522
(You have to pull yourself together and work hard.)

571
00:36:13,742 --> 00:36:14,842
(Come on.)

572
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,642
(How to comfort someone who is in a bad mood?)

573
00:36:54,924 --> 00:36:56,634
(She hides and cries secretly.)

574
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,762
(You care about her so much.)

575
00:37:02,863 --> 00:37:04,762
(Is she your girlfriend?)

576
00:37:08,371 --> 00:37:10,122
(I'm just her boss.)

577
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:19,533
(It's rare to find a generous and warm-hearted capitalist like you.)

578
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,440
(You really are a good boss who cares about your employees.)

579
00:37:27,355 --> 00:37:29,322
(That's right. A bad mood can affect)

580
00:37:29,403 --> 00:37:31,802
(the work atmosphere and efficiency of the company.)

581
00:37:36,863 --> 00:37:38,002
(God, please.)

582
00:37:38,135 --> 00:37:41,445
(Can someone give me a boss like the OP?)

583
00:37:45,328 --> 00:37:47,078
(What about me starting a poll)

584
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,469
(to see what are the greatest ways to destress?)

585
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,882
- Hello. - (Cheng Yao, come to my office.)

586
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,362
Okay.

587
00:38:15,198 --> 00:38:18,321
Boss, is there anything you need me to do?

588
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,762
These are the materials left after archiving.

589
00:38:21,071 --> 00:38:22,781
Take them to the shredder.

590
00:38:25,897 --> 00:38:29,006
It'll take a day to shred them all.

591
00:38:50,402 --> 00:38:52,242
(I can't do anything today, )

592
00:38:52,517 --> 00:38:53,906
(except shredding paper.)

593
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,946
(I wanted to look at the new case materials, )

594
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:57,490
(hoping to learn something from them.)

595
00:39:07,601 --> 00:39:09,042
You shredded too much at once.

596
00:39:09,878 --> 00:39:11,178
Leave after shredding.

597
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:36,741
What's the situation?

598
00:39:37,047 --> 00:39:39,517
Boss. Did someone break into our house?

599
00:39:40,343 --> 00:39:41,602
It's your dog.

600
00:39:42,078 --> 00:39:44,082
It made a mess in the living room.

601
00:39:44,671 --> 00:39:45,971
Remember to clean it up.

602
00:39:48,691 --> 00:39:50,922
Remember to make supper on time.

603
00:40:08,161 --> 00:40:10,212
(Develop a highly disciplined schedule.)

604
00:40:10,293 --> 00:40:12,366
(Find a sense of accomplishment in life.)

605
00:40:16,144 --> 00:40:17,202
(Beijing time.)

606
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:19,314
(9:12 am.)

607
00:40:19,448 --> 00:40:21,198
(Cheng Yao is late.)

608
00:40:25,491 --> 00:40:28,091
Looking at your outfit, you woke up late again today, didn't you?

609
00:40:28,266 --> 00:40:30,626
- You are the fifth one to be late today. - What is this?

610
00:40:30,725 --> 00:40:32,122
It's the new check-in system.

611
00:40:33,184 --> 00:40:35,309
This morning, the admin staff brought people here.

612
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:38,291
A facial recognition system was installed in this surveillance.

613
00:40:38,372 --> 00:40:40,447
Anyone who enters the law firm after nine o'clock

614
00:40:40,528 --> 00:40:42,311
will be automatically called out by the intelligent voice system.

615
00:40:42,335 --> 00:40:45,001
The time, the name of the latecomer, the check-in time, as well as

616
00:40:45,082 --> 00:40:48,042
the warning and punishment measures for different times will be announced.

617
00:40:48,544 --> 00:40:50,374
There's even a ladder of punishments.

618
00:40:50,762 --> 00:40:52,877
For me, who got in late within five minutes,

619
00:40:52,958 --> 00:40:54,078
I received a stern warning.

620
00:40:54,176 --> 00:40:56,566
For those more than 5 minutes and less than 15 minutes late,

621
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,666
deduct full attendance bonus for the month.

622
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:59,619
For those more than 15 minutes and less than 20 minutes late,

623
00:40:59,643 --> 00:41:01,083
deduct meal allowance for the month.

624
00:41:02,091 --> 00:41:03,391
That's sick.

625
00:41:03,944 --> 00:41:05,244
Good morning.

626
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:06,912
(Beijing time.)

627
00:41:06,993 --> 00:41:08,882
(9.16 am.)

628
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,562
(Bao Rui is late.)

629
00:41:10,779 --> 00:41:12,922
(The meal allowance will be deducted for the month.)

630
00:41:13,995 --> 00:41:15,295
What is this?

631
00:41:16,186 --> 00:41:17,307
What is this?

632
00:41:17,388 --> 00:41:19,682
We usually tolerate lateness, right?

633
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:23,282
As the future of Junheng, I help the boss with all the work.

634
00:41:23,497 --> 00:41:25,126
So what if I'm just a bit late?

635
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,802
Which stupid person came up with this policy? Is he jealous of me?

636
00:41:29,214 --> 00:41:31,454
- I'm that stupid person who came up with it. - You...

637
00:41:35,176 --> 00:41:37,499
From now on, everyone must come to work on time.

638
00:41:37,589 --> 00:41:39,989
The punishment system will be enforced very strictly.

639
00:41:40,381 --> 00:41:43,171
I hope everyone can be self-disciplined and can work efficiently.

640
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,602
No more meal allowance,

641
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,020
and I may be fired soon.

642
00:41:54,471 --> 00:41:56,071
The boss asked you to keep on shredding.

643
00:41:58,597 --> 00:41:59,717
All right.

644
00:41:59,863 --> 00:42:01,653
At least, there's only one box today.

645
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,711
I'm wasting my whole day here.

646
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,360
Miss Cheng.

647
00:42:45,601 --> 00:42:47,510
You shredded so many papers.

648
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,642
Madam, empty bottle.

649
00:42:49,743 --> 00:42:50,842
Thank you.

650
00:42:52,294 --> 00:42:55,851
Miss Cheng. Do you have other important things to do?

651
00:42:56,007 --> 00:42:58,882
Let me do the shredding. Leave these small things to me.

652
00:42:59,115 --> 00:43:00,475
How can I do this?

653
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,600
It's okay.

654
00:43:01,681 --> 00:43:03,136
You've been so nice to me all the time,

655
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,510
helping me collect empty bottles.

656
00:43:04,591 --> 00:43:05,677
I remember your kind gestures.

657
00:43:05,701 --> 00:43:08,362
(Is this what they call "good deeds will be rewarded"?)

658
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,880
Come on. Let me do it.

659
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,559
You go do the important stuff.

660
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,682
Let me do it.

661
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:15,282
Thank you, Madam.

662
00:43:15,434 --> 00:43:17,663
- Next time, I'll treat you to a cup of milk tea. - Okay.

663
00:43:17,687 --> 00:43:18,768
Go ahead and do your work.

664
00:43:19,044 --> 00:43:20,262
Thanks, Madam.
