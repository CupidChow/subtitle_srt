1
00:01:35,526 --> 00:01:38,808
(My Boss)

2
00:01:40,751 --> 00:01:44,257
(Episode 26: Cheng Yao, I miss you.)

3
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:46,825
(Qian Heng, I miss you.)

4
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,210
(Stop laughing.)

5
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,463
But you were really funny when you were being presumptuous.

6
00:01:54,563 --> 00:01:56,553
It's all because I cared about you, you know?

7
00:01:57,919 --> 00:01:59,350
I can feel it now.

8
00:02:01,396 --> 00:02:04,060
How do you plan to solve it?

9
00:02:04,344 --> 00:02:05,666
If you have trouble,

10
00:02:05,747 --> 00:02:07,494
you can apply to postpone the court session.

11
00:02:07,518 --> 00:02:09,082
I'll go back and deal with it for you.

12
00:02:10,504 --> 00:02:12,333
Shouldn't you say

13
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:15,082
"You should overcome all difficulties.

14
00:02:15,606 --> 00:02:16,887
I only want to see the result."?

15
00:02:16,968 --> 00:02:18,802
Something Qian Heng would say.

16
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,810
Well...

17
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,042
I'm not just your boss.

18
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:28,000
Although I miss you a little

19
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,002
when I'm facing difficulties,

20
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:32,340
(I still need to do it myself.)

21
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,802
(I can't ask for your help whenever I'm in trouble.)

22
00:02:35,109 --> 00:02:38,122
I want to go to the hospital that provided the diagnosis

23
00:02:38,203 --> 00:02:39,642
to see if there are any clues.

24
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:43,202
Ask Yu Fei to go with you.

25
00:02:43,614 --> 00:02:44,814
Isn't that weird?

26
00:02:44,895 --> 00:02:46,115
I'll fly back then.

27
00:02:46,535 --> 00:02:49,482
(No need. Focus on your work and don't trouble yourself.)

28
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:52,500
(Besides, )

29
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,904
(if the news spreads, )

30
00:02:53,985 --> 00:02:56,101
(they will say that not only is Qian Heng cancerous, )

31
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:59,522
(but he is also incapable of doing that.)

32
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:00,709
(It'll be weird.)

33
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:03,100
Cheng Yao, what are you thinking about?

34
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,002
You took a peek at me first.

35
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:08,169
Fine.

36
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:09,501
You need to guarantee

37
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,391
to not miss my call again.

38
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,163
Report your schedule to me every day. Otherwise, I'll still take a peek.

39
00:03:14,187 --> 00:03:15,442
(Yes, boss.)

40
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:18,322
(All right. I'll listen to you.)

41
00:03:18,525 --> 00:03:20,002
(I'm hanging up.)

42
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:38,391
It's difficult to guard against one of my own.

43
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:02,636
Lawyer Deng.

44
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:05,622
Didn't you say the young female lawyer

45
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,042
won't bug us again?

46
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:09,739
Why did my assistant tell me that she is still investigating?

47
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:12,482
Is she still going to proceed with the lawsuit?

48
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:15,316
Mr. Lu, calm down.

49
00:04:15,425 --> 00:04:16,705
Have a drink first.

50
00:04:19,687 --> 00:04:21,042
Lawyer Deng,

51
00:04:21,174 --> 00:04:23,442
It's not that I don't trust your ability

52
00:04:23,692 --> 00:04:25,363
but I asked someone to investigate her.

53
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,820
She has...

54
00:04:27,271 --> 00:04:29,324
She has Qian Heng to support her.

55
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,640
What's wrong with Qian Heng?

56
00:04:30,952 --> 00:04:32,172
Am I afraid of him?

57
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,030
Besides, I've started making preparations

58
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,941
after you tipped me off.

59
00:04:40,894 --> 00:04:43,718
On the name of the Golden Scale Award, I guarantee I'll win this case.

60
00:04:43,885 --> 00:04:45,082
All right?

61
00:04:46,928 --> 00:04:48,148
Boss.

62
00:04:48,636 --> 00:04:50,667
The follow-up press release and related pictures

63
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,905
have been posted using the title "Things in the Legal World".

64
00:04:52,929 --> 00:04:54,805
I predict it will cause a stir.

65
00:04:54,886 --> 00:04:56,686
We might even be trending on the top spot.

66
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:59,420
Great. Find a few influential accounts to share it.

67
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,339
We want it to be trending tonight.

68
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,562
All right.

69
00:05:08,263 --> 00:05:09,774
Wait, Lawyer Deng.

70
00:05:10,854 --> 00:05:15,030
Can you take down Junheng's lawyer with a few gossips?

71
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,139
This is a reverse move.

72
00:05:17,273 --> 00:05:20,940
We want to crush the opponent's client so she could back off.

73
00:05:26,776 --> 00:05:27,996
Mr. Lu.

74
00:05:28,727 --> 00:05:31,899
A good lawyer knows how to use law and public opinion.

75
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,060
I found you

76
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,049
because I want you to be ahead of the law.

77
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,386
Understand?

78
00:05:48,322 --> 00:05:51,842
(Pantry)

79
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,722
Cheng Yao.

80
00:05:59,091 --> 00:06:00,311
Cheng Yao.

81
00:06:02,249 --> 00:06:03,489
What did you two do?

82
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,330
- Throw the rubbish. - Pick up the parcel.

83
00:06:06,078 --> 00:06:07,838
- Pick up the parcel. - Throw the rubbish.

84
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,395
Enough. It's not your first date.

85
00:06:10,476 --> 00:06:11,990
There's no need to hide from me.

86
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,345
I don't want to do that but Yu Fei says

87
00:06:14,426 --> 00:06:16,217
we must keep a low profile in the office.

88
00:06:16,932 --> 00:06:18,152
Keep a low profile?

89
00:06:18,581 --> 00:06:21,361
You kissed in the pantry. How is that keeping a low profile?

90
00:06:24,109 --> 00:06:26,962
Oh. Can I borrow Fei for a while?

91
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,131
Take him. Just return him to me completely intact.

92
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,166
I want Fei to go to the hospital's male inpatient department

93
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,510
to take a testicular examination.

94
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:38,318
Cheng Yao.

95
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,961
What did Yu Fei do

96
00:06:40,042 --> 00:06:42,073
that makes you want to castrate him?

97
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,693
The opposition client in my case has forged evidence.

98
00:06:48,804 --> 00:06:50,844
He forged evidence that proves he has no testicles.

99
00:06:51,523 --> 00:06:55,000
I was wondering if Fei could accompany me to the hospital

100
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,561
to pretend as a DINK couple.

101
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,002
Perhaps we can get proof of them forging evidence.

102
00:06:59,578 --> 00:07:00,798
You scared me.

103
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:02,742
This will be difficult.

104
00:07:02,867 --> 00:07:04,427
Lu Jian is this hospital's shareholder.

105
00:07:04,515 --> 00:07:05,682
See?

106
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:10,309
(Lu Jian, Shareholding Percentage: 10%, Related Enterprises: 5)

107
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,170
No wonder.

108
00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:18,042
Why not ask Lawyer Qian and ask him to think of something?

109
00:07:18,546 --> 00:07:20,242
I can't always ask him for help.

110
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:21,915
I will think of something else.

111
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,042
Is your client Lin Feng Juan?

112
00:07:27,466 --> 00:07:28,802
Yes. How do you know?

113
00:07:29,013 --> 00:07:31,203
She's on the news. She's trending in the first place.

114
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:35,242
(Things in the Legal World)

115
00:07:49,771 --> 00:07:52,362
Why is Deng Ming using tricks from the last century?

116
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:55,304
Doesn't he know that the IP address can be checked on Weibo?

117
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,962
He even edited the pictures maliciously.

118
00:07:59,331 --> 00:08:01,081
What a disgusting move.

119
00:08:01,468 --> 00:08:03,937
Gosh, even Lin Feng Juan's family address has been exposed.

120
00:08:04,018 --> 00:08:05,648
That's so inhumane.

121
00:08:06,051 --> 00:08:08,322
Do they need to do that for a lawsuit?

122
00:08:10,273 --> 00:08:12,223
I've underestimated how despicable he is.

123
00:08:18,575 --> 00:08:19,842
Hello, Ms. Lin.

124
00:08:19,929 --> 00:08:23,158
(Lawyer Cheng, I won't engage in this lawsuit anymore.)

125
00:08:23,588 --> 00:08:24,938
I'm sorry.

126
00:08:25,478 --> 00:08:26,987
Help me drop the lawsuit.

127
00:08:27,085 --> 00:08:28,442
Wait.

128
00:08:28,695 --> 00:08:29,849
Why?

129
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,802
This is my karma.

130
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:38,162
I should not give birth to this child.

131
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,962
(I should not ask you to engage in this lawsuit for me.)

132
00:08:42,762 --> 00:08:46,100
(This is my life now. It is ruined.)

133
00:08:46,724 --> 00:08:49,362
But you are still young, Lawyer Cheng.

134
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,930
Stop wasting your time on me.

135
00:08:52,923 --> 00:08:54,792
Go and take other cases.

136
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,290
Ms. Lin?

137
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:07,133
- What are you doing? Find her? - Yes. I can't give up.

138
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:09,125
It's dangerous. I have a few muscular guys.

139
00:09:09,206 --> 00:09:11,386
Why don't you take them with you? How about Yu Fei?

140
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,629
Tan Ying, can you help me gather the evidence?

141
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:16,202
- Take a screenshot. - Sure.

142
00:09:16,892 --> 00:09:18,922
Fei, help me draft a lawyer's letter.

143
00:09:18,997 --> 00:09:20,282
- Sure. - Thank you.

144
00:09:20,591 --> 00:09:22,002
Stay safe.

145
00:09:23,388 --> 00:09:24,608
Slowly.

146
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:28,082
This is spoiled. Give that to me.

147
00:09:28,229 --> 00:09:29,659
I made you some tea.

148
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:32,041
Be careful.

149
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,402
(Deng Ming)

150
00:09:41,276 --> 00:09:42,496
Don't answer it.

151
00:09:43,229 --> 00:09:44,789
Why is this guy always clinging to you?

152
00:09:54,914 --> 00:09:57,484
(Cheng Xi, don't be too arrogant.)

153
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:00,522
(Don't touch my slice of the pie because you have found a new support.)

154
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:03,602
(You better take care of your sister before you feel arrogant.)

155
00:10:03,883 --> 00:10:06,179
What has Yao Yao been busy doing recently?

156
00:10:06,468 --> 00:10:09,770
I don't know. I think she accepted a legal aid case.

157
00:10:09,939 --> 00:10:11,159
What's wrong?

158
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:21,748
Yao Yao, what are you doing?

159
00:10:22,109 --> 00:10:23,282
(What's wrong?)

160
00:10:23,398 --> 00:10:25,918
(I just got out of the car and is preparing to meet my client.)

161
00:10:26,181 --> 00:10:27,722
Send me your location.

162
00:10:27,989 --> 00:10:29,362
It's so indecent!

163
00:10:33,711 --> 00:10:34,922
Come out!

164
00:10:35,109 --> 00:10:36,909
- Come out! - I dare you to come out!

165
00:10:36,989 --> 00:10:38,282
It's this woman!

166
00:10:39,124 --> 00:10:40,642
She even blackmailed other people!

167
00:10:40,752 --> 00:10:42,522
Why does our village have people like you?

168
00:10:42,927 --> 00:10:44,317
Everyone!

169
00:10:44,976 --> 00:10:46,350
I am Lin Feng Juan's lawyer.

170
00:10:46,468 --> 00:10:48,153
If you keep disturbing her, I'll call the police.

171
00:10:48,177 --> 00:10:49,926
- Are you trying to scare us? - Call the police?

172
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,126
Since you are defending her, you are also a bad person!

173
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,882
I'm the judge!

174
00:10:59,028 --> 00:11:00,248
Come inside.

175
00:11:02,109 --> 00:11:03,682
- Are you all right? - I'm fine.

176
00:11:03,766 --> 00:11:06,190
Lawyer Cheng, why did you still come here?

177
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,802
I don't want to involve you in this.

178
00:11:09,105 --> 00:11:10,456
What's happened to your face?

179
00:11:11,365 --> 00:11:13,002
Did Deng Ming send someone to hit you?

180
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,392
I don't know.

181
00:11:14,659 --> 00:11:16,002
The people who hit me

182
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:18,002
said he was avenging Min

183
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,990
but I know he didn't do it.

184
00:11:20,156 --> 00:11:22,162
Although we severed our ties,

185
00:11:22,587 --> 00:11:24,218
he won't do something like that.

186
00:11:25,093 --> 00:11:26,562
I think it was Deng Ming who did it.

187
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,699
He put the blame on your ex-husband

188
00:11:28,818 --> 00:11:30,209
so no one would suspect him.

189
00:11:32,195 --> 00:11:34,011
Do you have CCTV here? I'll go get the footage.

190
00:11:34,035 --> 00:11:36,777
I rented this place temporarily after leaving Min's place.

191
00:11:37,605 --> 00:11:39,034
There are no CCTVs here.

192
00:11:41,349 --> 00:11:42,642
Lawyer Cheng,

193
00:11:42,938 --> 00:11:44,458
Lu Jian's family runs many hospitals.

194
00:11:44,562 --> 00:11:45,962
He has a strong network.

195
00:11:46,116 --> 00:11:47,315
That Lawyer Deng as well.

196
00:11:47,396 --> 00:11:48,556
I found out

197
00:11:48,706 --> 00:11:50,562
that he is a very good lawyer.

198
00:11:50,683 --> 00:11:52,674
He is also friends with the judge.

199
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,252
Let's drop the case.

200
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:56,762
You shouldn't persuade me anymore.

201
00:11:57,778 --> 00:11:58,938
I've resigned myself to fate.

202
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,200
What about Han?

203
00:12:02,554 --> 00:12:03,669
Ms. Lin.

204
00:12:03,749 --> 00:12:04,961
As a mother,

205
00:12:05,051 --> 00:12:07,561
fighting for alimony is a right that the law gives you.

206
00:12:08,398 --> 00:12:10,110
The law protects every citizen.

207
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,870
It is not used to make moral judgments.

208
00:12:12,054 --> 00:12:14,234
You can't give up even if it's for Han.

209
00:12:14,671 --> 00:12:17,402
Don't worry. I'll arrange a hotel with good security for you.

210
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:18,990
The lawyer is here to scare us.

211
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,162
We are not afraid. What's so great about the lawyer?

212
00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:24,442
- Go and pack your bags. - Why should we be afraid of a lawyer?

213
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,269
Thank you, Lawyer Cheng.

214
00:12:26,349 --> 00:12:27,429
They are coming out!

215
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:28,950
Shameless! How dare you come out!

216
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,482
How shameless!

217
00:12:34,811 --> 00:12:36,202
You deserved it!

218
00:12:36,314 --> 00:12:37,534
Are you all right?

219
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,392
- What are you doing? - Stop!

220
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:40,656
- Stop! - What are you doing?

221
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,991
- Who poured it on you? - Wear this jacket.

222
00:12:44,015 --> 00:12:45,755
- Go inside first. - Go inside.

223
00:12:47,121 --> 00:12:48,341
Go and change.

224
00:12:51,173 --> 00:12:52,922
- Cheng Xi, do you have tissue? - Yes.

225
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:56,140
It's unavoidable for lawyers to face these confrontations.

226
00:12:56,445 --> 00:12:57,656
We are here to see what the trouble is.

227
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,568
- We don't know what happened. - Are you sure?

228
00:13:00,716 --> 00:13:02,919
- Officer, you can't falsely accuse me. - Falsely accuse you?

229
00:13:02,943 --> 00:13:04,973
- There's nothing in my hands. - Did you come here to buy groceries?

230
00:13:04,997 --> 00:13:07,320
Yao Yao, are you sure about this?

231
00:13:08,109 --> 00:13:11,388
- If you can't do it? I can take over. - No need.

232
00:13:11,469 --> 00:13:12,682
There's still a long way to go.

233
00:13:12,706 --> 00:13:13,926
I won't give up.

234
00:13:16,749 --> 00:13:18,890
We both know about Deng Ming's evil deeds.

235
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,801
What happened today

236
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:22,669
is nothing much for him.

237
00:13:22,771 --> 00:13:24,811
He will do more disgusting things alter.

238
00:13:24,978 --> 00:13:26,198
I know.

239
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:28,587
But I am a lawyer.

240
00:13:28,668 --> 00:13:30,442
I have a duty to protect justice.

241
00:13:30,699 --> 00:13:33,914
This case might also affect Lin Feng Juan's life.

242
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,802
I want to use my job to help her as much as I can.

243
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,042
She has been possessed by Qian Heng.

244
00:13:40,472 --> 00:13:42,350
What you are saying is exactly the same

245
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:43,927
as what Qian Heng said in university.

246
00:13:44,066 --> 00:13:46,909
The law protects everyone's basic rights and dignity,

247
00:13:46,989 --> 00:13:48,209
even the bad people's

248
00:13:48,933 --> 00:13:51,370
because the most important purpose of law is fairness.

249
00:13:51,668 --> 00:13:54,748
All right. I've told the police everything.

250
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:57,359
I'll bring Lin Feng Juan to the police station to do a report.

251
00:13:57,441 --> 00:13:58,682
Both of you should go and rest.

252
00:13:58,808 --> 00:14:00,424
I want to help Lin Feng Juan find a hotel.

253
00:14:00,448 --> 00:14:01,668
Let's meet at the hotel later.

254
00:14:01,826 --> 00:14:03,046
No problem.

255
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,370
Have some water.

256
00:14:19,749 --> 00:14:20,969
Lawyer Cheng,

257
00:14:21,562 --> 00:14:23,112
I've troubled you.

258
00:14:23,941 --> 00:14:25,161
Don't say that.

259
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,260
Although I'm not as experienced as Deng Ming,

260
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,501
I believe

261
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,774
the law will stand on the side of justice.

262
00:14:33,643 --> 00:14:34,863
Lawyer Cheng,

263
00:14:35,349 --> 00:14:36,698
you will be blessed.

264
00:14:41,197 --> 00:14:42,357
Oh,

265
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,209
you should ignore the discussion on the Internet.

266
00:14:45,701 --> 00:14:47,941
The marriage between you and Min is your private matter.

267
00:14:48,074 --> 00:14:50,093
No one else can judge you.

268
00:14:50,738 --> 00:14:53,879
You should rest well here and adjust your mood.

269
00:14:54,017 --> 00:14:56,117
Let's work together and win this case.

270
00:14:58,588 --> 00:15:00,522
I'm going back then, rest well.

271
00:15:01,604 --> 00:15:02,824
Lawyer Cheng,

272
00:15:03,172 --> 00:15:05,173
you should get a refund for this hotel.

273
00:15:05,254 --> 00:15:07,029
I can simply stay outside.

274
00:15:07,215 --> 00:15:10,220
I can't let you spend energy and money for my sake.

275
00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:13,619
Have you forgotten? Junheng has a special subsidy for legal aid cases.

276
00:15:13,732 --> 00:15:14,952
Don't feel stressed.

277
00:15:15,101 --> 00:15:16,321
Rest well.

278
00:15:22,196 --> 00:15:23,282
Are you done?

279
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,819
Cheng Yao is amazing now.

280
00:15:26,987 --> 00:15:29,707
I think she will look more like a lawyer compared to Qian Heng soon.

281
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,990
But I don't know anything about the subsidy you mentioned.

282
00:15:33,739 --> 00:15:35,929
Lawyer Qian said I could claim it.

283
00:15:36,725 --> 00:15:39,074
He is a stubborn person. When did he become so generous?

284
00:15:40,001 --> 00:15:42,002
Perhaps he has grown a conscience.

285
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:46,322
Oh, Cheng Xi. Thankfully, you called the police and arrived immediately.

286
00:15:48,071 --> 00:15:50,442
I didn't know when you called the police.

287
00:15:54,892 --> 00:15:56,112
Hello.

288
00:15:56,643 --> 00:15:57,863
Yes, speaking.

289
00:16:00,332 --> 00:16:02,241
Sure. I'll head over immediately.

290
00:16:02,415 --> 00:16:03,635
All right.

291
00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:06,402
The police station wants more details.

292
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:07,783
I'm going to send it to them now.

293
00:16:07,807 --> 00:16:09,619
I'll give the car to you so it's more convenient.

294
00:16:09,643 --> 00:16:10,863
I'm leaving.

295
00:16:15,124 --> 00:16:17,322
Cheng Xi, Lawyer Wu is quite reliable.

296
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,969
I can leave you to him with peace of mind.

297
00:16:23,644 --> 00:16:25,630
That means we will become people with firm support

298
00:16:25,654 --> 00:16:26,980
in Junheng & Co in the future.

299
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,310
We can do whatever we want.

300
00:16:28,437 --> 00:16:30,722
No. We must keep a low profile.

301
00:16:30,895 --> 00:16:32,922
Otherwise, Wu Jun will be arrogant.

302
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,149
Cheng Yao.

303
00:16:46,354 --> 00:16:49,126
This is Tan Ying's evidence, screenshots and the lawyer letter I drafted.

304
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,370
Take a look.

305
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:52,722
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

306
00:16:54,829 --> 00:16:56,990
Cheng Yao, you are back? How are you?

307
00:16:57,112 --> 00:17:00,459
- Did you get hurt? Show me. - I'm fine. It's not that bad.

308
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:03,151
Yu Fei, why didn't you call me as soon as she came back?

309
00:17:03,175 --> 00:17:04,539
You had been working overtime recently

310
00:17:04,563 --> 00:17:06,690
and finally got to sleep. I didn't want to wake you.

311
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:09,286
Get some rest. I was so scared when Lawyer Wu told me what happened.

312
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,002
No one would be able to deal with that.

313
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,590
Help me archive this.

314
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:14,593
This is the threatening letter

315
00:17:14,674 --> 00:17:17,194
sent by the opposition client of the family trust dispute case.

316
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:20,658
If Lawyer Qian is splashed with paint,

317
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,088
how will he deal with it?

318
00:17:29,075 --> 00:17:31,136
Let's summarize the case.

319
00:17:31,901 --> 00:17:32,965
According to the notice content,

320
00:17:32,989 --> 00:17:36,484
Mr. Chen Hua is the person in charge of Huateng Technology Co., Ltd.

321
00:17:36,565 --> 00:17:38,597
Prior to the 31st of December last year,

322
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:41,830
Mr. Chen Hua has 72.6% of the company's shares.

323
00:17:42,003 --> 00:17:45,030
He has a direct holding of 34.76% of the company's shares.

324
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:46,384
Lawyer Liang.

325
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,949
I think we are clear about this.

326
00:17:49,076 --> 00:17:50,296
There's no need to waste time.

327
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,162
- My habit is... - Understood.

328
00:17:58,433 --> 00:17:59,646
According to my client's information,

329
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,499
I've designed three insurance and trust models for my client

330
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,296
to help my client achieve a better return after tax,

331
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:06,727
stronger asset protection,

332
00:18:06,808 --> 00:18:09,276
better tax planning, reasonable wealth planning,

333
00:18:09,357 --> 00:18:11,276
and the protection of privacy

334
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:13,357
through simplifying the asset declaration process.

335
00:19:02,229 --> 00:19:03,949
All right. I think I understand everything.

336
00:19:04,029 --> 00:19:05,442
That's all for today.

337
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,762
All right.

338
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:11,186
I didn't expect it to end at 3pm.

339
00:19:11,347 --> 00:19:13,270
I thought our first meeting

340
00:19:13,351 --> 00:19:15,082
would run until tonight.

341
00:19:15,901 --> 00:19:18,290
Lawyer Liang, you are efficient indeed.

342
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,116
It's just a coincidence

343
00:19:20,197 --> 00:19:23,090
that my work habits and thought logic are similar to Lawyer Qian.

344
00:19:23,185 --> 00:19:25,948
Thanks to that, our progress rapidly.

345
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,189
I feel very happy to have the opportunity

346
00:19:28,284 --> 00:19:29,762
to learn from Lawyer Qian as well.

347
00:19:30,011 --> 00:19:31,402
Lawyer Liang, you are too humble.

348
00:19:31,714 --> 00:19:34,820
Bao Rui, use this opportunity to learn from Lawyer Liang.

349
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,482
I...

350
00:19:36,563 --> 00:19:38,922
Can I add you on WeChat?

351
00:19:39,062 --> 00:19:41,322
- Sure. - Let's exchange our contacts.

352
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,810
Here.

353
00:19:44,348 --> 00:19:46,899
- Here. - I want to learn from you. You can scan my code.

354
00:19:47,204 --> 00:19:48,802
Isn't this the QR code for payment?

355
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:50,442
Let me find it.

356
00:19:51,308 --> 00:19:52,949
Here it is.

357
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:55,322
- All right. - Can we have dinner together?

358
00:19:55,459 --> 00:19:57,202
Dinner? Sure. No problem.

359
00:20:03,933 --> 00:20:05,153
Bao Rui.

360
00:20:05,389 --> 00:20:06,802
The same "Bao" as Justice Bao.

361
00:20:06,979 --> 00:20:08,682
Sorry. I have urgent business.

362
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,137
Have dinner without me.

363
00:20:17,866 --> 00:20:19,086
Can I eat on his behalf?

364
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:40,642
(Yu Fei, are you around?)

365
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,770
(Tan Ying, are you around?)

366
00:20:55,765 --> 00:20:57,442
(Threatening Letters)

367
00:21:02,444 --> 00:21:03,882
(Tumor of the Legal World)

368
00:21:03,968 --> 00:21:08,149
(What I'm experiencing is what Qian Heng experienced before.)

369
00:21:08,632 --> 00:21:10,272
(He hasn't been defeated.)

370
00:21:10,449 --> 00:21:11,669
(Neither will I.)

371
00:21:13,067 --> 00:21:14,287
Cheng Yao, you are here?

372
00:21:14,739 --> 00:21:16,048
Milk tea. Do you want some?

373
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:17,729
No.

374
00:21:20,469 --> 00:21:21,689
Cheng Yao, you are here?

375
00:21:21,963 --> 00:21:23,963
Tan Ying and I have been looking all over for you.

376
00:21:24,004 --> 00:21:25,066
Well...

377
00:21:25,193 --> 00:21:26,602
Since our boss isn't around today

378
00:21:27,007 --> 00:21:28,188
and there aren't any urgent cases,

379
00:21:28,212 --> 00:21:29,812
let's go and play a murder mystery game.

380
00:21:30,161 --> 00:21:32,025
Won't you get tired memorizing the scripts?

381
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:35,491
How about tennis? You can sweat and vent your frustration.

382
00:21:35,589 --> 00:21:38,020
All right. I know all of you care about me

383
00:21:38,204 --> 00:21:40,474
but I have to face this on my own.

384
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,130
Are you really fine?

385
00:21:43,795 --> 00:21:45,575
Go. I want to be alone here.

386
00:21:45,864 --> 00:21:47,414
I'll leave the milk tea here.

387
00:21:48,229 --> 00:21:50,590
- Replenish your sugar level. - Let's go.

388
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,162
Don't split hairs.

389
00:21:53,092 --> 00:21:54,563
Enough. Let's go.

390
00:22:13,135 --> 00:22:15,282
What? Do you need help?

391
00:22:16,011 --> 00:22:17,802
You went and asked Tan Ying for help, right?

392
00:22:20,412 --> 00:22:22,682
Yes. But they didn't reply to me.

393
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:26,899
(Boss, what is it?)

394
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,200
(She replied to me now.)

395
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,161
Why do you have to do this?

396
00:22:32,668 --> 00:22:34,908
I was afraid that you wouldn't be happy if I called you.

397
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,050
But I'm worried about you.

398
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:39,940
I know.

399
00:22:40,106 --> 00:22:42,095
But I'm fine. Don't worry.

400
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,322
Cheng Yao.

401
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,620
The opposition lawyer in this case is Deng Ming.

402
00:22:48,029 --> 00:22:49,550
I know you hate him

403
00:22:49,653 --> 00:22:50,882
and want to win against him

404
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,214
but if you...

405
00:22:56,749 --> 00:22:57,969
Sorry.

406
00:22:58,509 --> 00:22:59,729
I spoke too much.

407
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:01,729
I couldn't help it.

408
00:23:02,796 --> 00:23:04,016
Don't need to worry about me.

409
00:23:04,709 --> 00:23:06,042
I will surely win.

410
00:23:06,269 --> 00:23:09,389
Cheng Yao, don't try to guess Deng Ming's intention as a normal lawyer.

411
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,710
Having confidence is not good enough to win against him.

412
00:23:12,137 --> 00:23:13,402
Don't simply believe

413
00:23:13,483 --> 00:23:16,253
bad motivational quotes like "I'm a lawyer with conscience and justice

414
00:23:16,277 --> 00:23:18,682
so I can defeat a powerful lawyer by working hard."

415
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:20,797
Why do feel like I'm hearing

416
00:23:20,878 --> 00:23:24,419
a motivational quote that says "I will win if I am Qian Heng's girlfriend?"

417
00:23:26,094 --> 00:23:28,282
It feels like I'm the boss' woman.

418
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:30,442
Cheng Yao, do you know what time it is now?

419
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,482
What is that brain of yours thinking about?

420
00:23:32,722 --> 00:23:33,962
(It's thinking about you.)

421
00:23:36,347 --> 00:23:37,669
(All right. I'm going to work.)

422
00:23:37,756 --> 00:23:39,122
(I'm hanging up.)

423
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:40,682
Bye.

424
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:59,082
Bao Rui, help me book the earliest flight back.

425
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:00,425
I want to go back.

426
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,562
- Help me find that document. - Sure.

427
00:24:10,662 --> 00:24:13,482
Sorry for keeping all of you from getting off work.

428
00:24:13,976 --> 00:24:15,170
The Golden Scale Award's judging team

429
00:24:15,194 --> 00:24:16,945
will soon come here and do an assessment.

430
00:24:17,324 --> 00:24:19,537
I'm here to check everyone's work notes.

431
00:24:19,628 --> 00:24:21,629
Take it all out and show them to me. Don't run.

432
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,081
I'm not done yet. Why are you running away?

433
00:24:25,389 --> 00:24:26,666
You didn't write anything, right?

434
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:28,759
- I did. - In that case, show it to me.

435
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:30,178
Quick.

436
00:24:30,449 --> 00:24:32,786
Everyone else, take out your work notes. I want to see them.

437
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,030
Cheng Yao,

438
00:24:34,198 --> 00:24:35,418
did you write your work notes?

439
00:24:43,901 --> 00:24:45,121
What are you doing?

440
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:47,596
I forgot to bring it, Lawyer Wu.

441
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,980
Don't use children's tricks on me.

442
00:24:49,043 --> 00:24:50,519
- Take it out. - I did write it.

443
00:24:50,613 --> 00:24:51,769
Let me repeat this again.

444
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,909
The review for this year's Golden Scale Award

445
00:24:53,989 --> 00:24:55,571
will soon begin.

446
00:24:55,652 --> 00:24:57,830
All of you must take it seriously. All right?

447
00:24:57,988 --> 00:25:00,149
If you have time for your petty tricks,

448
00:25:00,253 --> 00:25:01,753
you should learn from Cheng Yao instead.

449
00:25:01,777 --> 00:25:03,939
Let me show you Cheng Yao's notes.

450
00:25:04,267 --> 00:25:05,487
See for yourself.

451
00:25:07,611 --> 00:25:08,831
Take a look.

452
00:25:13,116 --> 00:25:15,776
Prepare it immediately. I'll check them again tomorrow.

453
00:25:18,052 --> 00:25:19,272
Cheng Yao.

454
00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:22,082
You are slowly becoming Qian Heng.

455
00:25:22,515 --> 00:25:24,106
I'm just learning from my boss.

456
00:25:25,338 --> 00:25:27,562
You must take care. Balance work and rest.

457
00:25:27,964 --> 00:25:29,429
How are you? Are you doing well?

458
00:25:29,509 --> 00:25:31,830
Should I find you a psychologist?

459
00:25:31,957 --> 00:25:33,177
There's no need.

460
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,860
I feel bad because everyone cares a lot about me.

461
00:25:38,586 --> 00:25:39,587
We will soon be a family.

462
00:25:39,668 --> 00:25:40,888
No need to be polite with me.

463
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:45,790
President Zhang.

464
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:47,769
Yes.

465
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,896
Calm down. I'll head over immediately.

466
00:25:52,977 --> 00:25:53,977
All right.

467
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:57,069
- Remember the notes! I'll check them again tomorrow. - Got it.

468
00:26:00,086 --> 00:26:01,770
I have a slight emergency here.

469
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:04,451
Order for me if you've arrived. I like to eat anything you order.

470
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,769
All right. I'm at the Law Association.

471
00:26:20,716 --> 00:26:21,936
Where are you going?

472
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:24,155
Can't I go to the toilet?

473
00:26:24,236 --> 00:26:26,162
No! Sit over there! I'm still holding it in.

474
00:26:26,474 --> 00:26:28,362
- No... - President Zhang!

475
00:26:29,251 --> 00:26:31,141
- Sorry for being late. - Wu Jun!

476
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:32,842
You are finally here.

477
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:35,280
Lawyer Qian wouldn't let me leave.

478
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:36,803
I couldn't even go to the toilet.

479
00:26:36,884 --> 00:26:38,110
No one does that.

480
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:40,852
Wu Jun, tell me how we can make a complaint about the Law Association.

481
00:26:40,876 --> 00:26:42,891
I came to complain about Deng Ming's false evidence

482
00:26:42,915 --> 00:26:45,338
but he asked me to leave a message with the call center.

483
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:46,420
Ridiculous!

484
00:26:46,501 --> 00:26:47,989
I'm getting off work.

485
00:26:48,069 --> 00:26:50,070
I know. President Zhang, you are getting off work.

486
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,482
You don't take complaints, right?

487
00:26:51,563 --> 00:26:53,482
- Yes. - I know.

488
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:56,001
Well, President Zhang,

489
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:58,244
since both of us are here,

490
00:26:58,353 --> 00:27:00,229
help us out tomorrow morning

491
00:27:00,363 --> 00:27:02,203
and deal with our complaint first. All right?

492
00:27:02,313 --> 00:27:03,925
This is nothing.

493
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:05,256
There's no problem.

494
00:27:05,337 --> 00:27:06,765
But why are you stopping me from leaving?

495
00:27:06,789 --> 00:27:08,270
Can you solve the problem? No.

496
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:10,989
Yes. I'm sure it's because he is anxious, right?

497
00:27:11,134 --> 00:27:13,725
- Are you anxious? - You can't do that even if you are anxious.

498
00:27:13,749 --> 00:27:15,629
He never complained in person.

499
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,397
You will know if you check the system.

500
00:27:17,478 --> 00:27:19,806
Besides, the Law Association's system

501
00:27:19,887 --> 00:27:21,358
will close automatically on time.

502
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:22,989
I can't solve it even if I want to.

503
00:27:23,069 --> 00:27:24,310
- Right? - I know, right?

504
00:27:24,439 --> 00:27:26,219
Do you hear that? He wants to help us.

505
00:27:26,332 --> 00:27:27,552
It's the system...

506
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:30,689
President Zhang, how about this?

507
00:27:30,981 --> 00:27:33,201
Junheng will help get sponsors

508
00:27:33,309 --> 00:27:35,682
to help the Law Association develop a 24-hour

509
00:27:35,763 --> 00:27:37,203
intelligent complaint system.

510
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,860
You can improve your efficiency

511
00:27:39,069 --> 00:27:40,569
and many things can be done online.

512
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:43,122
You won't have to see his gloomy face, right?

513
00:27:43,404 --> 00:27:45,164
Look. That's exactly what I'm talking about.

514
00:27:45,229 --> 00:27:47,503
There's no choice because he was born with this face.

515
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,212
I see it all the time. Don't take it to heart.

516
00:27:49,236 --> 00:27:50,527
I'm sorry about that.

517
00:27:50,608 --> 00:27:51,790
After all, the Law Association

518
00:27:51,814 --> 00:27:54,694
is supposed to solve disputes for our members.

519
00:27:54,775 --> 00:27:56,229
Right, Lawyer Qian?

520
00:27:56,309 --> 00:27:58,030
Don't be sorry about it.

521
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,406
If you think my suggestion is good,

522
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:01,373
I will call our IT manager now

523
00:28:01,454 --> 00:28:03,374
and ask him to give you an improvement proposal.

524
00:28:03,437 --> 00:28:04,538
How's that?

525
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:06,210
If you say that,

526
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,620
I'll accept your offer.

527
00:28:08,752 --> 00:28:10,071
Of course.

528
00:28:10,162 --> 00:28:11,693
Let me share my executive's contact.

529
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:13,657
- Great. Share it with me. - You can liaise with him.

530
00:28:13,681 --> 00:28:16,362
For the review assessment for next season's Golden Scale Award,

531
00:28:16,457 --> 00:28:20,009
please help us out when you bring the review team to Junheng & Co.

532
00:28:20,613 --> 00:28:21,973
Have you been waiting to say that?

533
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:25,229
I won't disturb you any longer. We'll be leaving.

534
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,370
Of course.

535
00:28:28,198 --> 00:28:29,418
Don't drag me!

536
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,479
- I'm leaving, President Zhang! - Bye.

537
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:34,962
Gosh.

538
00:28:36,355 --> 00:28:37,690
Weren't you away at work?

539
00:28:37,771 --> 00:28:39,162
Did you teleport here?

540
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,065
Deng Ming forged evidence to bully Cheng Yao.

541
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:42,515
Does anyone at Junheng care about it?

542
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:44,939
That might be the case, but can you solve it in this manner?

543
00:28:45,292 --> 00:28:46,506
The Golden Scale Award is awarded by them.

544
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,549
You went directly to them and made a complaint.

545
00:28:48,723 --> 00:28:49,992
How can they be happy about it?

546
00:28:50,244 --> 00:28:51,964
Call me if something like this happens again.

547
00:28:51,988 --> 00:28:53,938
I did. Your phone is engaged, all right?

548
00:28:54,373 --> 00:28:55,593
Oh, that's right.

549
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:59,170
I blocked you

550
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,202
because you might cause me trouble.

551
00:29:02,235 --> 00:29:05,042
Thanks for supporting my soon-to-be sister-in-law.

552
00:29:05,484 --> 00:29:07,284
I didn't expect you to help your subordinate.

553
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,802
Are you doing it for my happiness?

554
00:29:10,242 --> 00:29:11,344
You are overthinking.

555
00:29:11,425 --> 00:29:13,296
I can't accept Deng Ming doing such despicable acts

556
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,591
for the Golden Scale Award.

557
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:17,507
No matter what, I'm happy to see you put in the effort.

558
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:19,710
Also, allow some space for your subordinates.

559
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,171
I think Cheng Yao has done well.

560
00:29:22,068 --> 00:29:23,109
What?

561
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:24,691
Cheng Xi is waiting to eat with me!

562
00:29:26,614 --> 00:29:27,834
Are you crazy?

563
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:48,402
- Yao Yao. - Why did you return?

564
00:29:48,941 --> 00:29:51,010
With my efficiency, I got it done in a day.

565
00:29:52,892 --> 00:29:54,882
Yao Yao, you said you miss me.

566
00:29:54,974 --> 00:29:56,442
I miss you too.

567
00:29:57,989 --> 00:29:59,209
Let's go.

568
00:30:00,043 --> 00:30:01,263
Boss!

569
00:30:01,572 --> 00:30:02,792
Boss!

570
00:30:03,162 --> 00:30:04,382
Boss!

571
00:30:05,749 --> 00:30:08,070
I kept calling you. Didn't you hear me?

572
00:30:08,236 --> 00:30:09,745
I had a hard time catching up to you.

573
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:11,905
Cheng Yao, why are you here too?

574
00:30:12,238 --> 00:30:14,712
I'm going to the train station.

575
00:30:14,845 --> 00:30:17,802
It's all right. I can fetch you. It's along the way.

576
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,066
Great. I'm going in the same direction as Cheng Yao.

577
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:21,442
Send me there too.

578
00:30:24,548 --> 00:30:26,942
Bao Rui, don't you have work to do? Go back to the firm.

579
00:30:27,023 --> 00:30:28,522
I can also work at home.

580
00:30:28,834 --> 00:30:30,155
Cheng Yao, how is your case?

581
00:30:30,282 --> 00:30:31,766
Boss is worried that you can't handle it alone

582
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,682
so he flew back immediately. See?

583
00:30:35,727 --> 00:30:37,010
You haven't finished your case?

584
00:30:37,091 --> 00:30:38,522
How could he?

585
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:40,713
I wasn't sure why he felt anxious.

586
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:44,371
Thankfully, Lawyer Liang who is working with us

587
00:30:44,452 --> 00:30:45,892
is experienced and efficient.

588
00:30:46,032 --> 00:30:47,669
She is as efficient as the boss.

589
00:30:47,749 --> 00:30:50,240
She works quickly, and she is also pretty. It's true.

590
00:30:50,321 --> 00:30:52,842
Bao Rui, you should go back if you have nothing else to do.

591
00:30:52,961 --> 00:30:54,245
Cheng Yao has something to report to me.

592
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,263
We will have dinner together so I can't fetch you.

593
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:59,188
Dinner? It's not convenient since you are not heading home.

594
00:30:59,269 --> 00:31:01,739
- Yes. - Why don't I join you for dinner?

595
00:31:02,739 --> 00:31:04,122
What about hotpot?

596
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,440
Get in.

597
00:31:13,275 --> 00:31:15,544
Don't boil this fried meat.

598
00:31:15,774 --> 00:31:17,642
It's delicious if you eat it as is.

599
00:31:17,893 --> 00:31:20,053
It's true. I used to boil it

600
00:31:20,234 --> 00:31:21,664
but it's delicious without cooking.

601
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:24,729
It's a waste to boil it.

602
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,442
This is so delicious.

603
00:31:28,692 --> 00:31:30,722
I can finish another plate of this.

604
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,810
There's another plate.

605
00:32:17,851 --> 00:32:19,071
Who ordered it?

606
00:32:19,709 --> 00:32:20,869
I'm eating it.

607
00:32:21,087 --> 00:32:22,687
Can I take it home if I can't finish it?

608
00:32:25,037 --> 00:32:26,637
Thankfully, we are efficient.

609
00:32:26,718 --> 00:32:27,948
Otherwise, we can't eat here.

610
00:32:28,106 --> 00:32:30,937
Especially Lawyer Liang. She is so efficient.

611
00:32:32,314 --> 00:32:35,202
If she comes to our firm, can she become a partner directly?

612
00:32:38,154 --> 00:32:40,504
I hope I can also become a partner.

613
00:32:42,164 --> 00:32:43,384
Why are you in a rush?

614
00:32:43,982 --> 00:32:45,202
Didn't you just join recently?

615
00:32:46,692 --> 00:32:47,932
I've been here for three years.

616
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:58,322
I took a picture of her presentation today.

617
00:32:58,803 --> 00:33:00,023
Let's study it.

618
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,282
Let's see how she can be so efficient.

619
00:33:11,308 --> 00:33:12,528
I lost my wallet.

620
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,570
Where is my wallet?

621
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:22,030
Oh no! I dropped my wallet.

622
00:33:23,571 --> 00:33:24,791
I remember.

623
00:33:25,053 --> 00:33:27,259
I took out a folder when I was at the airport.

624
00:33:27,451 --> 00:33:28,940
I'm sure it fell out when I took out the folder.

625
00:33:28,964 --> 00:33:30,282
What? You...

626
00:33:33,099 --> 00:33:34,319
It's all right.

627
00:33:34,451 --> 00:33:35,909
All airports have CCTVs now.

628
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,882
I'll go to the airport and find it tomorrow.

629
00:33:39,028 --> 00:33:40,339
Eat. It's fine.

630
00:33:52,593 --> 00:33:54,904
CCTV! Why didn't I think about it?

631
00:33:55,318 --> 00:33:56,909
There are CCTVs everywhere.

632
00:33:57,044 --> 00:33:58,802
The cameras at court trials.

633
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,890
They record everything.

634
00:34:01,327 --> 00:34:03,807
Besides, videos from courts are the most authoritative videos.

635
00:34:05,122 --> 00:34:06,342
What?

636
00:34:07,224 --> 00:34:08,880
I have a new idea regarding Lin Feng Juan's case.

637
00:34:08,904 --> 00:34:10,613
I'll go back and arrange the information. Enjoy.

638
00:34:10,637 --> 00:34:11,806
Aren't you going to report to me?

639
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:13,602
I'll do it next time. Thank you, Bao Rui.

640
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:22,082
Thinking about her case's new idea and meeting...

641
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:26,002
Meeting me to discuss work.

642
00:34:26,098 --> 00:34:27,962
- Which is more important? - The case.

643
00:34:30,579 --> 00:34:32,282
The case is not as important

644
00:34:32,483 --> 00:34:34,153
as discussing work with you.

645
00:34:35,075 --> 00:34:36,675
You are the most important person to me.

646
00:34:39,847 --> 00:34:40,946
Cheng Yao is still a kid.

647
00:34:41,027 --> 00:34:43,082
She just joined the industry so she knows nothing.

648
00:34:44,058 --> 00:34:46,318
But she has really improved quickly.

649
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,242
She was a coward when she first joined.

650
00:34:48,366 --> 00:34:50,206
Right now, she can handle her work on her own.

651
00:34:50,835 --> 00:34:52,985
The younger generation is terrifying.

652
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:56,959
I have high hopes for her.

653
00:34:58,524 --> 00:34:59,964
This fried meat is really delicious.

654
00:35:00,272 --> 00:35:01,442
Try it.

655
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:03,010
Pay the bill.

656
00:35:07,259 --> 00:35:08,779
Can this be claimed as a work expense?

657
00:35:09,823 --> 00:35:11,362
I'll pay.

658
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:40,602
(Oh no, I forgot about my boyfriend.)

659
00:36:06,509 --> 00:36:07,729
Are you awake?

660
00:36:09,688 --> 00:36:11,734
You still remember the other living person in your house.

661
00:36:11,758 --> 00:36:12,978
I'm sorry.

662
00:36:15,787 --> 00:36:19,080
Shouldn't the boss be happy when his employee is focusing on her work?

663
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,682
I need to teach you something.

664
00:36:22,155 --> 00:36:24,402
Work and life should be separated.

665
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:30,010
Who was the one who got insomnia from working all day long?

666
00:36:32,164 --> 00:36:34,522
All right. Go to sleep. Quick.

667
00:36:35,303 --> 00:36:36,523
Let me ask you.

668
00:36:36,643 --> 00:36:37,863
When does the trial start?

669
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:41,162
Didn't you say work and life have to be separated?

670
00:36:41,243 --> 00:36:43,152
I'm asking you when the trial will start.

671
00:36:43,754 --> 00:36:45,505
Two more days. What is it?

672
00:36:46,888 --> 00:36:48,576
Since there's not much time left,

673
00:36:48,657 --> 00:36:50,162
I can forget about the past

674
00:36:50,277 --> 00:36:52,467
and let you consult me for free.

675
00:36:52,912 --> 00:36:55,109
No need. I can deal with it myself.

676
00:36:55,282 --> 00:36:56,673
You are making me feel awkward.

677
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:58,901
You are my girlfriend.

678
00:36:58,982 --> 00:37:01,182
I can help you out no matter how complicated a case is.

679
00:37:01,294 --> 00:37:03,162
I don't want you to feel stressed at work.

680
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:06,130
But I want to help you and not drag you down.

681
00:37:06,318 --> 00:37:09,429
It's all right. I have long legs. Drag them as much as you want.

682
00:37:09,509 --> 00:37:11,140
I have muscles too.

683
00:37:11,302 --> 00:37:12,686
Is that so? Let's have a competition.

684
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:14,190
All right. It's one in the morning.

685
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,080
You have a flight at 7am tomorrow.

686
00:37:16,589 --> 00:37:17,670
Hurry up.

687
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:19,074
Also, I'm telling you.

688
00:37:19,193 --> 00:37:22,442
Stop doing dangerous things like flying here and there.

689
00:37:22,895 --> 00:37:25,405
Although I'm touched, I feel bad about it.

690
00:37:27,928 --> 00:37:30,045
Go to sleep. I'll make breakfast for you when you wake up.

691
00:37:30,069 --> 00:37:31,289
All right.

692
00:37:35,502 --> 00:37:37,602
Come here.

693
00:37:39,918 --> 00:37:42,018
- All right. Good night. - Good night.

694
00:38:38,469 --> 00:38:39,762
Sorry, I'm late.

695
00:38:40,201 --> 00:38:41,989
It's all right. You are on time.

696
00:38:42,092 --> 00:38:44,602
I know that Lawyer Qian is never late.

697
00:38:51,469 --> 00:38:54,002
It's better to prepared when you are outside.

698
00:38:55,253 --> 00:38:56,642
How did you know I caught a cold?

699
00:38:57,647 --> 00:38:59,033
The temperature is fluctuating.

700
00:38:59,177 --> 00:39:00,540
Keep it for yourself. I have medicine.

701
00:39:00,564 --> 00:39:01,784
I appreciate your kindness.

702
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:03,961
Don't worry about me.

703
00:39:18,781 --> 00:39:20,001
Let's begin.

704
00:39:20,284 --> 00:39:21,642
We should speed up our progress.

705
00:39:21,971 --> 00:39:23,611
The meeting was supposed to be four days.

706
00:39:24,699 --> 00:39:25,940
Seven hours a day.

707
00:39:26,116 --> 00:39:28,909
I rescheduled the meeting to twelve hours a day.

708
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,955
It'll be done in less than two and a half days.

709
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,882
That's all for today.

710
00:39:51,251 --> 00:39:52,522
Lawyer Qian. Lawyer Bao.

711
00:39:52,655 --> 00:39:54,147
Since we are still working together tonight,

712
00:39:54,171 --> 00:39:55,589
why don't we have dinner together?

713
00:39:55,669 --> 00:39:56,889
Sure. What are we eating?

714
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,329
Sure.

715
00:40:12,937 --> 00:40:15,042
Out with it. I'm delivering something to Cheng Xi.

716
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:16,442
It's going well over here.

717
00:40:16,523 --> 00:40:18,287
(I think I can go back sooner than expected.)

718
00:40:18,311 --> 00:40:20,202
Are you telling me your schedule?

719
00:40:21,469 --> 00:40:24,282
I want to say thank you for helping Cheng Yao out last time.

720
00:40:24,405 --> 00:40:26,885
(Help me take care of her when I'm not around these two days.)

721
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,050
That's all?

722
00:40:29,641 --> 00:40:31,402
Qian, speaking of which,

723
00:40:32,052 --> 00:40:33,802
I want to thank Cheng Yao.

724
00:40:34,124 --> 00:40:37,583
Although I'm taking pleasure form someone else's pain,

725
00:40:37,687 --> 00:40:41,236
(I can finally show my ability as Cheng Xi's boyfriend)

726
00:40:41,323 --> 00:40:43,153
(because I was given the chance.)

727
00:40:43,658 --> 00:40:44,928
Congratulations.

728
00:40:46,413 --> 00:40:48,293
(Why has your personality changed recently?)

729
00:40:48,397 --> 00:40:49,957
You even care about your assistant now.

730
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:52,490
Am I?

731
00:40:53,107 --> 00:40:54,348
That's impossible.

732
00:40:54,429 --> 00:40:56,029
I'm doing it for the Golden Scale Award.

733
00:40:57,403 --> 00:40:59,033
This is so rare.

734
00:40:59,259 --> 00:41:02,442
(You finally know how to share my anxiety for the Golden Scale Award.)

735
00:41:03,134 --> 00:41:04,162
Lawyer Qian.

736
00:41:04,244 --> 00:41:06,004
(The dishes are getting cold. Come and eat.)

737
00:41:06,043 --> 00:41:07,263
I'll be done soon.

738
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:11,572
(Are you eating with Liang Yi Ran?)

739
00:41:11,653 --> 00:41:13,533
What do you think of the cooperation this time?

740
00:41:13,876 --> 00:41:15,202
(She is very professional.)

741
00:41:15,369 --> 00:41:16,913
If I invite her to join our firm,

742
00:41:16,994 --> 00:41:18,949
(will it make both our lives easier?)

743
00:41:19,075 --> 00:41:20,385
(Is that better for us?)

744
00:41:23,418 --> 00:41:25,298
Do you think you can invite her if you want to?

745
00:41:26,881 --> 00:41:28,711
Fine. I understand.

746
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,322
Golden Scale Award?

747
00:41:35,412 --> 00:41:37,202
I know what's on your mind,

748
00:41:37,324 --> 00:41:38,544
Qian.

749
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:49,922
Lawyer Deng, look at my watch.

750
00:41:51,669 --> 00:41:54,061
Mr. Lu, you have great aesthetics.

751
00:41:54,142 --> 00:41:55,230
Of course.

752
00:41:55,348 --> 00:41:56,897
I have watch shops under my name.

753
00:41:57,298 --> 00:41:59,069
- No wonder. - Lawyer Deng,

754
00:41:59,172 --> 00:42:00,682
your watch looks nice too.

755
00:42:01,115 --> 00:42:02,882
I'm just using it to see the time.

756
00:42:03,804 --> 00:42:05,863
Why don't you go to my shop?

757
00:42:06,484 --> 00:42:08,402
You can use my name over there.

758
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,162
You're too polite.

759
00:42:10,635 --> 00:42:12,602
Mr. Lu, I'm going to the toilet.

760
00:42:17,069 --> 00:42:18,289
I'm going out.

761
00:42:24,605 --> 00:42:25,825
Brother-in-law.

762
00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:30,478
Former brother-in-law.

763
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:32,980
- Yes. - Cheng Yao, what's the meaning of this?

764
00:42:33,365 --> 00:42:36,245
Didn't you ask me not to appear before the two of you?

765
00:42:36,341 --> 00:42:37,581
But you are looking for me now.

766
00:42:38,092 --> 00:42:40,065
- Do you want to apologize? - Yes.

767
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,870
It was my fault.

768
00:42:42,005 --> 00:42:43,402
Please forgive me.

769
00:42:43,578 --> 00:42:46,642
I thought about it and think you are so much better than Wu Jun.

770
00:42:48,664 --> 00:42:49,749
Brother-in-law.

771
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:51,670
Since we used to be a family,

772
00:42:51,773 --> 00:42:54,882
can you spare me later?

773
00:42:55,547 --> 00:42:58,267
You are so excellent. I'm afraid that I will suffer an utter defeat.

774
00:42:58,346 --> 00:42:59,545
Fine.

775
00:42:59,626 --> 00:43:01,322
Since you are so sincere,

776
00:43:01,484 --> 00:43:02,793
I accept your apology.

777
00:43:03,627 --> 00:43:05,409
You know I'm a kind person.

778
00:43:05,509 --> 00:43:07,501
I'm always willing to give people a second chance.

779
00:43:07,525 --> 00:43:09,790
However, it's different in court.

780
00:43:09,893 --> 00:43:12,122
You only have yourself to blame for being incapable.
