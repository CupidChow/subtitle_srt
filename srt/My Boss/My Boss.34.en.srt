1
00:01:35,613 --> 00:01:38,794
(My Boss)

2
00:01:40,145 --> 00:01:41,337
(Episode 34)

3
00:01:41,418 --> 00:01:44,704
(The issue between us didn't start today.)

4
00:01:55,028 --> 00:01:57,230
- I'm leaving now. Bye.   - I'll leave first, Cheng Yao.

5
00:01:57,311 --> 00:01:58,402
See you tomorrow.

6
00:02:02,741 --> 00:02:03,941
I'm leaving.

7
00:02:04,021 --> 00:02:05,420
- See you tomorrow.   - Bye.

8
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,710
Bye.

9
00:02:08,356 --> 00:02:09,396
See you tomorrow.

10
00:02:09,485 --> 00:02:10,494
Bye.

11
00:02:15,581 --> 00:02:17,602
(Yao Yao, I was wrong yesterday.)

12
00:02:17,697 --> 00:02:19,140
(Can you forgive me?)

13
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,340
(This alumni gathering is really a great opportunity.)

14
00:02:21,428 --> 00:02:23,230
(I still hope you can come with me.)

15
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,748
(I'll wait for you downstairs.)

16
00:02:26,806 --> 00:02:28,762
(After all, he's doing it for my own good.)

17
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,722
(Am I being too sensitive?)

18
00:02:40,407 --> 00:02:45,522
(Law Alumni Association)

19
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,641
No wonder it's a prestigious college.

20
00:02:55,722 --> 00:02:57,352
All the famous lawyers are here.

21
00:02:58,456 --> 00:02:59,922
Is my makeup too heavy?

22
00:03:00,062 --> 00:03:01,082
No, it's not.

23
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:06,510
But my lipstick seems too red.

24
00:03:06,627 --> 00:03:08,922
I'll go to the restroom real quick. You go in first.

25
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,882
I think it looks good.

26
00:03:17,026 --> 00:03:19,638
(It's such an important occasion. I can't let Qian Heng lose face.)

27
00:03:24,857 --> 00:03:26,067
Qian Heng.

28
00:03:29,555 --> 00:03:31,035
I'm leaving for overseas next week.

29
00:03:31,116 --> 00:03:32,722
I want to bid you farewell.

30
00:03:33,054 --> 00:03:35,242
I'm sorry for what happened before.

31
00:03:35,445 --> 00:03:37,402
Cheng Yao has forgiven you, but I haven't.

32
00:03:37,494 --> 00:03:39,002
So from now on, we don't need to see each other anymore.

33
00:03:39,692 --> 00:03:40,902
I understand.

34
00:03:41,641 --> 00:03:42,851
Just as I thought,

35
00:03:43,003 --> 00:03:45,123
you have eventually been conquered by Cheng Yao.

36
00:03:45,316 --> 00:03:46,666
On the day of your wedding,

37
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,291
please convey my congratulations.

38
00:03:49,868 --> 00:03:52,265
Qian Heng, you're in a relationship now.

39
00:03:52,363 --> 00:03:54,570
- Your girlfriend, could she also be a lawyer?   - Yes.

40
00:03:54,656 --> 00:03:56,155
Although she's still at Jincheng & Co,

41
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,476
I will definitely help her have a better future.

42
00:03:58,586 --> 00:04:00,066
I'll introduce her to you two later.

43
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:02,156
Young girls nowadays are really smart.

44
00:04:02,237 --> 00:04:03,478
They know how to choose the right person.

45
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:06,162
She is indeed very smart. So I want to help her as much as I can.

46
00:04:06,256 --> 00:04:07,442
If there are suitable cases,

47
00:04:07,555 --> 00:04:09,482
I hope you can look after her.

48
00:04:10,687 --> 00:04:12,437
With you around, there's no need for us to take care of her.

49
00:04:12,548 --> 00:04:14,242
She just needs to listen to you. Isn't that enough?

50
00:04:14,774 --> 00:04:16,191
Oh, you guys.

51
00:04:17,562 --> 00:04:18,772
Yao Yao.

52
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:19,922
Come.

53
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,237
His girlfriend?

54
00:04:23,767 --> 00:04:25,286
Let me introduce her to you.

55
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:27,617
- This is my girlfriend, Cheng Yao.   - She's really beautiful.

56
00:04:27,698 --> 00:04:29,282
When are you planning to get married?

57
00:04:29,466 --> 00:04:30,776
Why get married?

58
00:04:31,334 --> 00:04:33,322
Marriage only protects property, not relationships.

59
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:35,781
Only the insecure seek warmth in clinging together.

60
00:04:35,862 --> 00:04:38,309
This is something that every family law attorney should understand.

61
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,922
My girlfriend and I both think the same way.

62
00:04:40,763 --> 00:04:42,473
Would you both like some champagne?

63
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:44,601
This is chilled. She can't drink.

64
00:04:46,008 --> 00:04:47,218
No.

65
00:04:49,173 --> 00:04:50,602
She has a high alcohol tolerance.

66
00:04:51,668 --> 00:04:52,878
What's wrong?

67
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,989
Qian Heng.

68
00:04:56,076 --> 00:04:57,286
What case are you busy with lately?

69
00:04:59,756 --> 00:05:01,225
I'm still the same.

70
00:05:09,316 --> 00:05:10,526
That's good.

71
00:05:14,905 --> 00:05:17,202
Qian Heng, we should go now.

72
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,106
- Let's make plans for another day.   - See you later. Bye.

73
00:05:19,187 --> 00:05:20,722
- Goodbye.   - Bye.

74
00:05:21,515 --> 00:05:22,562
Bye.

75
00:05:26,998 --> 00:05:29,402
Are you upset?

76
00:05:30,282 --> 00:05:31,481
No.

77
00:05:31,829 --> 00:05:34,402
I just don't know how to resolve our differences.

78
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,351
When you say these things,

79
00:05:37,432 --> 00:05:39,147
have you ever considered discussing them with me?

80
00:05:39,404 --> 00:05:40,994
Are you referring to marriage?

81
00:05:41,859 --> 00:05:43,075
That day at the restaurant,

82
00:05:43,156 --> 00:05:44,915
when I heard you say you didn't want to get married

83
00:05:45,187 --> 00:05:46,282
and just wanted to focus on your career,

84
00:05:46,363 --> 00:05:49,427
I thought we were on the same page.

85
00:05:49,876 --> 00:05:51,002
Qian Heng,

86
00:05:52,356 --> 00:05:53,962
that's not what I meant.

87
00:05:54,441 --> 00:05:56,511
I mean, you always make decisions for me

88
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,362
regarding my career plans and even my views on marriage.

89
00:05:59,798 --> 00:06:01,313
You always think that what you do,

90
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:03,042
what you want, and what you insist on are right.

91
00:06:03,805 --> 00:06:05,575
Have you ever considered my thoughts?

92
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:08,128
Or do you think I don't need to have any thoughts at all?

93
00:06:08,396 --> 00:06:09,807
No. Of course not.

94
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:13,116
I simply want to care for you, look after you, protect you,

95
00:06:13,221 --> 00:06:14,572
and help you steer clear of mistakes.

96
00:06:14,684 --> 00:06:15,968
Don't be angry.

97
00:06:16,266 --> 00:06:18,202
What I want is understanding and respect,

98
00:06:18,524 --> 00:06:19,795
not this kind of care.

99
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:26,719
Forget it.

100
00:06:27,996 --> 00:06:29,842
I want to be alone. I'm going home.

101
00:08:12,989 --> 00:08:14,042
Here you go.

102
00:08:22,256 --> 00:08:24,087
So, last night,

103
00:08:25,277 --> 00:08:26,747
you went home alone?

104
00:08:31,214 --> 00:08:33,205
I had insomnia yesterday.

105
00:08:33,925 --> 00:08:35,794
I stared at the ceiling all night.

106
00:08:37,306 --> 00:08:39,216
So this is what it feels like to not be able to sleep.

107
00:08:41,556 --> 00:08:42,766
What's wrong?

108
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:45,387
Work is over. Why aren't you going home?

109
00:08:47,437 --> 00:08:48,907
Why go home so early?

110
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,730
Anyway, I can't sleep at night.

111
00:08:54,398 --> 00:08:55,787
What's going on?

112
00:08:59,261 --> 00:09:00,442
Cheng Yao

113
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:03,082
is mad at me.

114
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:05,647
Maybe I'm just mad at myself.

115
00:09:06,301 --> 00:09:07,850
I know I can't run away,

116
00:09:08,316 --> 00:09:10,626
but I didn't dare to face him, so I escaped to your place.

117
00:09:11,749 --> 00:09:13,642
I don't even know what I did wrong.

118
00:09:14,396 --> 00:09:15,722
Suddenly, we had an issue.

119
00:09:15,828 --> 00:09:17,298
Things were going so well before.

120
00:09:17,977 --> 00:09:20,096
I know. We were doing great.

121
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,509
As long as he's there,

122
00:09:21,658 --> 00:09:24,562
no matter what happened, I felt at ease.

123
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,557
But recently,

124
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,181
his thoughts and actions

125
00:09:31,884 --> 00:09:33,555
make me feel disrespected.

126
00:09:34,078 --> 00:09:35,395
I'm even being looked down upon.

127
00:09:35,476 --> 00:09:36,865
This makes no sense.

128
00:09:37,108 --> 00:09:38,627
I just wanted to care for her more.

129
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,442
Why does she feel that I don't respect her?

130
00:09:44,693 --> 00:09:45,903
Qian Heng,

131
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,882
this is love.

132
00:09:48,381 --> 00:09:49,622
It's not a debate.

133
00:09:49,703 --> 00:09:51,613
Where does all this logic and right or wrong come from?

134
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:55,099
Use your intelligence and move it toward emotional intelligence.

135
00:09:55,293 --> 00:09:56,973
Think about what she really wants

136
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:59,244
and try to understand her feelings.

137
00:10:00,927 --> 00:10:04,842
Do you still want to be with him now?

138
00:10:09,806 --> 00:10:11,602
Or do you want to break up with him?

139
00:10:11,956 --> 00:10:13,267
I don't want to break up.

140
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,990
Yao Yao,

141
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:25,242
some things don't have to be solved immediately.

142
00:10:25,661 --> 00:10:27,212
For this matter,

143
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,667
you can just keep him waiting. Don't bother him first.

144
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:34,522
Maybe he's anxious right now too.

145
00:10:36,076 --> 00:10:37,122
No.

146
00:10:37,642 --> 00:10:39,042
I have to go ask her right now.

147
00:10:39,124 --> 00:10:40,722
What exactly does she mean?

148
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:44,162
If you go to her like this, the situation will only get worse.

149
00:10:44,672 --> 00:10:45,852
You should give her some space.

150
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:47,091
You can move back to the villa, calm down,

151
00:10:47,172 --> 00:10:48,837
and think carefully about where the problem lies.

152
00:10:48,918 --> 00:10:49,968
Then, you can go talk to her.

153
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:51,439
It won't be too late, buddy.

154
00:10:52,796 --> 00:10:54,026
I think

155
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:57,379
you should give yourselves some time.

156
00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:00,179
Maybe there will be a turning point.

157
00:11:07,836 --> 00:11:09,046
You're right.

158
00:11:10,773 --> 00:11:13,204
Maybe she doesn't even want to see me right now.

159
00:11:26,356 --> 00:11:27,745
My little sister.

160
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:29,488
Really.

161
00:11:34,796 --> 00:11:36,006
Take it back and redo it.

162
00:11:47,846 --> 00:11:49,366
Got scolded by Lawyer Qian again?

163
00:11:52,316 --> 00:11:53,526
Yu Fei.

164
00:11:54,476 --> 00:11:56,426
I've already revised it 17 times.

165
00:11:57,186 --> 00:11:58,616
What's wrong with him?

166
00:12:00,421 --> 00:12:01,430
People from Jincheng & Co said

167
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:03,152
Cheng Yao has been working with Gu Bei Qing recently

168
00:12:03,233 --> 00:12:04,489
and they have won several cases.

169
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,287
But Lawyer Qian has been so irritable as if he's having menopause.

170
00:12:07,553 --> 00:12:09,362
People from Jincheng & Co are all asking

171
00:12:11,413 --> 00:12:13,453
if Cheng Yao is cheating on Lawyer Qian.

172
00:12:13,989 --> 00:12:15,110
Did she really cheat on him?

173
00:12:15,224 --> 00:12:18,041
What do you think? If it's true, wouldn't he have gone to Jincheng already?

174
00:12:18,122 --> 00:12:19,753
Why would he take it out on us?

175
00:12:19,876 --> 00:12:23,346
Besides, who would fall for Gu Bei Qing after seeing Lawyer Qian?

176
00:12:23,483 --> 00:12:25,553
What's the real reason?

177
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:28,713
When gods fight, mortals suffer.

178
00:12:29,972 --> 00:12:31,282
Where should I make changes?

179
00:12:31,716 --> 00:12:33,626
Can he give me a hint?

180
00:12:34,092 --> 00:12:35,302
Change fate.

181
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,122
Where should I go to change my fate?

182
00:12:40,546 --> 00:12:42,636
I never thought we would actually win this case.

183
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,282
My luck has improved.

184
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,266
The bracelet really works.

185
00:12:46,556 --> 00:12:48,199
It's because we did a good investigation.

186
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:49,816
But as long as you're happy, whatever.

187
00:12:49,897 --> 00:12:51,875
Cheng Yao from Jincheng & Co performed exceptionally well just now.

188
00:12:51,956 --> 00:12:53,466
Her thinking is clear and her logic is rigorous.

189
00:12:53,547 --> 00:12:55,796
- It seems she truly has some skills.   - Exactly.

190
00:12:55,882 --> 00:12:58,715
I heard that after her skills improved, she dumped Qian Heng.

191
00:12:58,796 --> 00:13:00,157
Looks like it's true.

192
00:13:00,236 --> 00:13:04,705
And Qian Heng, because of the breakup, has been miserable all day.

193
00:13:04,861 --> 00:13:06,071
Is that so?

194
00:13:08,196 --> 00:13:10,516
Yao Yao, are you okay?

195
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,962
- I'll explain to them.   - No need.

196
00:13:13,181 --> 00:13:14,802
The more we talk about it, the worse it gets.

197
00:13:15,276 --> 00:13:17,086
I'll treat you to a meal since we won the case.

198
00:13:17,356 --> 00:13:18,442
Okay.

199
00:13:19,236 --> 00:13:20,446
Are you okay?

200
00:13:21,693 --> 00:13:24,082
I'm fine. Just felt a little slippery under my feet.

201
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:27,138
It was fine during the court hearing just now.

202
00:13:33,739 --> 00:13:35,082
Qian Heng.

203
00:13:35,964 --> 00:13:39,882
- President Wang.   - My daughter always talks to me about you.

204
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:45,146
When do you have time to have a meal with her?

205
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,722
Sorry, President Wang.

206
00:13:49,813 --> 00:13:51,284
I have been really busy lately.

207
00:13:51,381 --> 00:13:52,482
Even if work is busy,

208
00:13:52,563 --> 00:13:54,518
personal matters should also be taken seriously.

209
00:13:54,657 --> 00:13:56,922
Look at you now. You're already single.

210
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,802
What's wrong with having a meal with my daughter?

211
00:13:59,955 --> 00:14:01,482
- Let's go.   - Go.

212
00:14:07,974 --> 00:14:09,202
President Wang.

213
00:14:10,203 --> 00:14:11,403
Those are all rumors.

214
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:14,242
My girlfriend and I have a good relationship.

215
00:14:14,445 --> 00:14:15,538
Qian Heng,

216
00:14:15,619 --> 00:14:17,522
I understand that heartbreak is painful.

217
00:14:17,661 --> 00:14:19,260
But you need to face reality.

218
00:14:19,356 --> 00:14:21,116
You can't indulge in fantasies.

219
00:14:21,415 --> 00:14:24,965
Even if you were dumped, you can't give up on yourself like this.

220
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:27,826
Yes.

221
00:14:29,996 --> 00:14:31,282
Take a look at this inheritance case.

222
00:14:31,363 --> 00:14:32,792
See if you have any ideas.

223
00:14:35,905 --> 00:14:37,430
The litigant is called Chen Lin Li.

224
00:14:37,517 --> 00:14:41,088
Many years ago, she co-founded Kaili Culture with her husband, Zhang Kai.

225
00:14:41,372 --> 00:14:42,483
Now in the PR industry,

226
00:14:42,564 --> 00:14:44,643
it is also one of the top dark horses,

227
00:14:45,116 --> 00:14:46,826
currently estimated at nearly 10 billion in worth.

228
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,088
A few months ago,

229
00:14:48,169 --> 00:14:50,802
Chen Lin Li took her husband, Zhang Kai, and their son, Zhang Ran,

230
00:14:51,018 --> 00:14:52,562
to go on vacation abroad.

231
00:14:52,656 --> 00:14:54,979
During a hot air balloon ride, an accident occurred.

232
00:14:55,091 --> 00:14:57,682
Her husband and son died despite rescue efforts.

233
00:14:58,673 --> 00:15:00,181
Chen Lin Li and her mother-in-law, Huang Ran,

234
00:15:00,262 --> 00:15:02,472
disagreed on how to divide the inheritance.

235
00:15:03,465 --> 00:15:05,545
Huang Ran wanted to divide the company's shares,

236
00:15:05,653 --> 00:15:07,725
but Chen Lin Li wanted to distribute the inheritance

237
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:09,282
to her mother-in-law in another form.

238
00:15:09,526 --> 00:15:12,407
But in the first trial, our litigant lost the case.

239
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:18,562
Although there was no public court record in the first trial,

240
00:15:18,654 --> 00:15:21,189
I speculate that the focus of their dispute was

241
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,482
the order of death of Zhang Kai and Zhang Ran.

242
00:15:25,618 --> 00:15:26,945
If the father died first,

243
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,892
then the inheritance would be evenly distributed among

244
00:15:28,973 --> 00:15:31,242
Chen Lin Li, Huang Ran, and the child who was alive at that time.

245
00:15:31,437 --> 00:15:34,467
When the child died, the inheritance belonged to Chen Lin Li.

246
00:15:35,473 --> 00:15:37,142
If the child died first,

247
00:15:37,275 --> 00:15:39,745
then the inheritance should be evenly distributed among the parents.

248
00:15:40,001 --> 00:15:41,197
When the father died,

249
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:43,875
the inheritance will be evenly distributed to Chen Lin Li and Huang Ran.

250
00:15:44,374 --> 00:15:45,584
Right.

251
00:15:47,486 --> 00:15:49,963
In simple terms, if the child died first,

252
00:15:50,044 --> 00:15:52,084
Chen Lin Li will receive less of the inheritance.

253
00:15:52,231 --> 00:15:54,140
If the father died first,

254
00:15:54,276 --> 00:15:56,036
Chen Lin Li will receive more of the inheritance.

255
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:58,185
The local authorities also determined

256
00:15:58,493 --> 00:16:00,442
that the weaker child suffered more severe injuries,

257
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:02,437
so they presumed the child passed away first.

258
00:16:02,814 --> 00:16:04,437
The decision of the first trial was also based on

259
00:16:04,516 --> 00:16:06,105
the fact that the child passed away first,

260
00:16:06,364 --> 00:16:08,604
resulting in an increased share of the inheritance for Huang Ran.

261
00:16:08,685 --> 00:16:10,426
Just the real estate and cash alone

262
00:16:10,507 --> 00:16:12,322
cannot fill Huang Ran's share of the inheritance.

263
00:16:12,436 --> 00:16:14,885
Splitting of Kaili Culture's shares is inevitable.

264
00:16:15,676 --> 00:16:16,886
But

265
00:16:17,556 --> 00:16:21,466
if it can be proven that the husband, Zhang Kai, died first,

266
00:16:21,896 --> 00:16:23,765
the outcome will be completely different.

267
00:16:23,898 --> 00:16:27,729
There is a high chance that Chen Lin Li can protect Kaili Culture's equity.

268
00:16:29,636 --> 00:16:31,068
For the distribution of inheritance,

269
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:34,922
it's really cruel to constantly infer the time of death of loved ones.

270
00:16:36,012 --> 00:16:37,222
Yes.

271
00:16:39,221 --> 00:16:40,490
But

272
00:16:42,116 --> 00:16:44,825
the litigant has appointed you as the attorney.

273
00:16:45,323 --> 00:16:46,523
The litigant knows me?

274
00:16:46,621 --> 00:16:48,402
Huang Ran's attorney is Qian Heng.

275
00:16:54,476 --> 00:16:56,060
The decision to take on this case is up to you.

276
00:16:56,145 --> 00:16:57,355
I'll respect your decision.

277
00:17:26,006 --> 00:17:27,216
Ms. Chen.

278
00:17:31,276 --> 00:17:33,482
- Hello, I'm Cheng Yao.   - Lawyer Cheng.

279
00:17:33,668 --> 00:17:35,162
- Please sit.   - Okay.

280
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,306
Would you like something to drink?

281
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,070
Anything is fine.

282
00:17:42,452 --> 00:17:43,852
- One hot cocoa, please.   - Thank you.

283
00:17:43,933 --> 00:17:45,143
Okay, please wait.

284
00:17:48,773 --> 00:17:49,983
Lawyer Cheng,

285
00:17:50,349 --> 00:17:52,739
I believe you have reviewed my information.

286
00:17:53,529 --> 00:17:55,776
Now, the progress of my case is as follows...

287
00:17:55,857 --> 00:17:57,513
The biggest dispute between you and your mother-in-law

288
00:17:57,594 --> 00:18:00,082
is the inheritance of shares in Kaili Culture. Am I right?

289
00:18:01,234 --> 00:18:03,112
You don't want Kaili Culture's shares to be divided.

290
00:18:03,193 --> 00:18:04,682
You hope to divide it in the form of cash or real estate

291
00:18:04,763 --> 00:18:06,882
and give it to your mother-in-law.

292
00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:09,030
You want to have full control of Kaili Culture.

293
00:18:10,142 --> 00:18:14,202
The biggest dispute now is the time of death of your son and husband.

294
00:18:15,172 --> 00:18:16,521
How did you find out?

295
00:18:17,571 --> 00:18:19,715
During the first trial,

296
00:18:19,942 --> 00:18:21,382
no one was allowed to attend the hearing.

297
00:18:21,471 --> 00:18:23,864
Although your case did not have a public trial,

298
00:18:24,067 --> 00:18:27,282
your mother-in-law, Ms. Huang Ran, has accepted some media interviews.

299
00:18:27,436 --> 00:18:28,866
I have done some research.

300
00:18:30,598 --> 00:18:33,078
- Hello, your hot cocoa.   - Thank you.

301
00:18:33,286 --> 00:18:36,010
I have learned that there are flaws

302
00:18:36,091 --> 00:18:37,952
in the local handling of your son and husband's time of death.

303
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:41,004
Therefore, there is controversy over the order of their deaths.

304
00:18:41,116 --> 00:18:42,326
Lawyer Cheng,

305
00:18:42,812 --> 00:18:45,032
you don't have to go to those reported cases.

306
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:47,803
I can provide you with firsthand information.

307
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,079
I understand that you have lost two loved ones at the same time.

308
00:18:51,184 --> 00:18:52,402
It must be very painful.

309
00:18:52,516 --> 00:18:53,842
I will reduce the number of times I ask you

310
00:18:54,015 --> 00:18:57,157
for details that are not relevant to the case unless necessary.

311
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,631
There are only a few key questions that I need your answers to.

312
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,240
I only want Kaili Culture.

313
00:19:03,436 --> 00:19:05,267
The rest, I can let go.

314
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:07,555
Can you help me fight for it?

315
00:19:07,891 --> 00:19:10,482
Since you have chosen me, I will do my best.

316
00:19:12,756 --> 00:19:14,602
Just one bold question.

317
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,418
Did you choose me as your attorney

318
00:19:19,236 --> 00:19:21,442
because I am Lawyer Qian Heng's girlfriend?

319
00:19:28,049 --> 00:19:29,598
I found out from the news

320
00:19:29,803 --> 00:19:32,406
that my mother-in-law's lawyer has been replaced by Qian Heng.

321
00:19:33,435 --> 00:19:35,225
I looked up his information online

322
00:19:35,462 --> 00:19:39,011
and found that he hardly ever loses a case.

323
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:40,689
So I am very worried.

324
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:42,803
Later on, I found out about your existence.

325
00:19:43,371 --> 00:19:44,581
I thought

326
00:19:45,099 --> 00:19:47,210
if you were to be my attorney,

327
00:19:47,676 --> 00:19:49,065
maybe things would be different.

328
00:19:50,316 --> 00:19:52,366
I am honored that you chose me.

329
00:19:52,885 --> 00:19:55,035
But there are some things I need to make clear to you.

330
00:19:56,252 --> 00:19:58,482
I can only use my professional abilities to serve you.

331
00:19:58,564 --> 00:19:59,882
As for anything else,

332
00:20:00,438 --> 00:20:03,035
I will not use my position to try and bypass the law

333
00:20:03,116 --> 00:20:05,516
or influence the opposing lawyer or the outcome of the case.

334
00:20:06,116 --> 00:20:08,602
Also, Lawyer Qian Heng is very professional.

335
00:20:08,884 --> 00:20:11,554
He will not go easy on me just because I am your attorney.

336
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,040
So I'm afraid I might disappoint you.

337
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,410
There's still some time before the court session.

338
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,459
You still have time to find another lawyer.

339
00:20:29,365 --> 00:20:30,755
I'm sorry, Lawyer Cheng.

340
00:20:30,888 --> 00:20:32,002
I apologize to you.

341
00:20:33,004 --> 00:20:34,273
I've changed my mind.

342
00:20:38,962 --> 00:20:40,602
From our conversation just now,

343
00:20:40,763 --> 00:20:43,924
I can sense your professionalism as a lawyer.

344
00:20:45,175 --> 00:20:46,805
You are serious and meticulous,

345
00:20:46,956 --> 00:20:48,149
gentle yet powerful,

346
00:20:48,642 --> 00:20:51,047
which is not something I see in other lawyers.

347
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:56,696
That's why I want you to stay as a lawyer.

348
00:20:57,636 --> 00:20:58,846
Lawyer Cheng,

349
00:20:59,011 --> 00:21:00,322
I want to work with you.

350
00:21:07,636 --> 00:21:08,846
Okay.

351
00:21:09,421 --> 00:21:11,050
Let me confirm the details with you again.

352
00:21:11,876 --> 00:21:13,086
Thank you.

353
00:21:22,734 --> 00:21:23,944
Hello.

354
00:21:25,316 --> 00:21:26,516
Mr. Chen.

355
00:21:27,099 --> 00:21:28,309
Are you alone?

356
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,202
What a coincidence.

357
00:22:19,612 --> 00:22:20,822
What coincidence?

358
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,080
What do you think?

359
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,585
Chen, where is she?

360
00:22:42,289 --> 00:22:43,879
If she's not here, it means she has left.

361
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:49,162
I give up on you.

362
00:23:11,437 --> 00:23:13,082
- Long time no see.   - Yao Yao.

363
00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:15,489
How have you been lately?

364
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,780
What do you need from me?

365
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:25,509
Can you not take the Chen Lin Li case?

366
00:23:25,796 --> 00:23:26,956
Why?

367
00:23:27,149 --> 00:23:28,922
Her mother-in-law, Huang Ran's lawyer is me.

368
00:23:29,068 --> 00:23:30,109
I know.

369
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,722
And I also know that if it wasn't for you,

370
00:23:32,925 --> 00:23:34,895
Chen Lin Li would never have noticed me.

371
00:23:35,521 --> 00:23:37,040
But I just joined Jincheng & Co

372
00:23:37,133 --> 00:23:38,802
and I don't plan on being picky about cases.

373
00:23:39,094 --> 00:23:40,771
If you're worried about your career at Jincheng & Co,

374
00:23:40,892 --> 00:23:42,722
I can recommend some higher-quality cases to you.

375
00:23:42,845 --> 00:23:44,722
I guarantee you'll win the lawsuit.

376
00:23:46,524 --> 00:23:48,724
The cases at Jincheng are indeed not as stable as Junheng's.

377
00:23:48,836 --> 00:23:50,316
But we are all working hard

378
00:23:50,461 --> 00:23:51,642
and don't need your help.

379
00:23:51,778 --> 00:23:55,737
And don't worry, I will treat Chen Lin Li's case fairly and objectively.

380
00:23:55,818 --> 00:23:58,220
I won't interfere with your work, just like in other cases.

381
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,040
But you have already interfered with mine.

382
00:24:00,292 --> 00:24:02,173
Now that I know you are the opposing lawyer,

383
00:24:02,254 --> 00:24:04,162
how can I not be concerned about this matter?

384
00:24:08,876 --> 00:24:10,886
Then, you will have to work hard to adjust yourself.

385
00:24:11,421 --> 00:24:13,171
This is work for both of us.

386
00:24:13,284 --> 00:24:14,494
Yao Yao,

387
00:24:14,638 --> 00:24:16,949
I don't want our relationship to be strained even further.

388
00:24:17,646 --> 00:24:19,362
I have let you have your way in many things before.

389
00:24:19,521 --> 00:24:21,544
But when it comes to a case, I won't mix in any personal feelings.

390
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:23,202
This is work. I can't let you have your way.

391
00:24:23,283 --> 00:24:24,753
Why do you have to let me have my way?

392
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:26,809
I am also a lawyer.

393
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,180
Or do you think I will use my identity as your girlfriend

394
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:30,471
to force you to compromise?

395
00:24:34,036 --> 00:24:35,122
Qian Heng,

396
00:24:35,762 --> 00:24:38,396
you have never treated me as a mature and independent lawyer.

397
00:24:38,507 --> 00:24:40,324
You don't respect the fact that we are opponents now.

398
00:24:40,414 --> 00:24:42,002
No. Absolutely not.

399
00:24:42,115 --> 00:24:43,666
I have never disrespected you.

400
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:45,716
And I have tried my best to accommodate you.

401
00:24:45,813 --> 00:24:47,896
But this case,

402
00:24:48,093 --> 00:24:49,922
it's not something we can't avoid.

403
00:24:50,653 --> 00:24:53,446
The last time I talked to you about respect, you didn't listen at all.

404
00:25:24,087 --> 00:25:25,202
Qian Heng,

405
00:25:25,651 --> 00:25:28,251
you have never treated me as a mature and independent lawyer.

406
00:25:28,501 --> 00:25:30,531
You don't respect the fact that we are opponents now.

407
00:25:55,574 --> 00:25:56,882
What's wrong, Bao Rui?

408
00:25:56,974 --> 00:25:58,602
Boss, I just found out

409
00:25:58,834 --> 00:26:00,635
that Chen Lin Li's attorney is Cheng Yao.

410
00:26:00,716 --> 00:26:02,325
(Then, should we not take this case?)

411
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:04,071
Why not take it?

412
00:26:04,676 --> 00:26:06,785
Why?

413
00:26:07,516 --> 00:26:09,082
Cheng Yao is your girlfriend.

414
00:26:09,195 --> 00:26:10,465
Don't you have to go easy on her?

415
00:26:11,581 --> 00:26:12,688
Go back to the law firm now

416
00:26:12,769 --> 00:26:13,979
and work overtime with me.

417
00:26:17,755 --> 00:26:18,965
I shouldn't have called you.

418
00:26:47,036 --> 00:26:48,682
But you have already interfered with mine.

419
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:50,682
Now that I know you are the opposing lawyer,

420
00:26:50,885 --> 00:26:52,596
how can I not be concerned about this matter?

421
00:26:52,676 --> 00:26:54,586
(Am I being too harsh on him?)

422
00:26:55,195 --> 00:26:56,791
(It's not easy for us to meet,)

423
00:26:56,933 --> 00:26:58,282
(but in the end...)

424
00:27:22,361 --> 00:27:23,611
On a weekend like this,

425
00:27:23,692 --> 00:27:26,682
you come to my house and sigh more than 10 times in half an hour.

426
00:27:27,116 --> 00:27:29,386
- Did I?   - Seriously.

427
00:27:32,076 --> 00:27:34,915
Actually, you don't have to take on Chen Lin Li's case.

428
00:27:34,996 --> 00:27:38,025
Why do you have to strain your relationship over one case?

429
00:27:38,278 --> 00:27:40,308
I know it's not necessary.

430
00:27:41,231 --> 00:27:43,020
I know it puts him in a difficult position,

431
00:27:43,156 --> 00:27:44,616
but I just can't help it.

432
00:27:45,115 --> 00:27:48,859
I want to compete with him in court, as a lawyer and opponent.

433
00:27:49,636 --> 00:27:51,945
You two have a unique relationship.

434
00:27:52,551 --> 00:27:54,377
Do you think I'm being too much?

435
00:27:54,458 --> 00:27:55,756
He's so good to me,

436
00:27:55,853 --> 00:27:57,763
but I seem to have hurt him.

437
00:27:58,436 --> 00:28:01,362
Actually, I always have moments of self-doubt in this relationship.

438
00:28:03,397 --> 00:28:05,347
I'm afraid I'll never catch up to him in my lifetime.

439
00:28:06,956 --> 00:28:09,002
But what I fear even more is being seen as just a trophy by his side,

440
00:28:09,341 --> 00:28:11,341
like Liang Yi Ran said.

441
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:14,546
The more I like him, the more unbalanced I feel.

442
00:28:18,222 --> 00:28:20,762
But Qian Heng loves you. I can see it.

443
00:28:20,862 --> 00:28:23,083
He takes this relationship seriously.

444
00:28:23,174 --> 00:28:25,220
I know he's serious about me.

445
00:28:26,228 --> 00:28:27,939
I'm serious about him too.

446
00:28:28,418 --> 00:28:31,202
Just because we're both so serious, it's easy to get hurt, isn't it?

447
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,630
Forget it.

448
00:28:36,557 --> 00:28:38,878
In the end, it's because I'm not good enough.

449
00:28:38,996 --> 00:28:40,745
That's why I'm so insecure.

450
00:28:40,998 --> 00:28:42,747
It was the same with Liang Yi Ran's matter.

451
00:28:42,966 --> 00:28:44,562
And Chen Lin Li's case too.

452
00:28:44,731 --> 00:28:47,585
If I were stronger, I wouldn't be like this now,

453
00:28:47,757 --> 00:28:49,242
so desperate to prove myself.

454
00:28:50,486 --> 00:28:53,882
I'm begging you to cheer up.

455
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:56,039
You're so smart and hardworking.

456
00:28:56,609 --> 00:29:00,038
Not long from now, you can also become a famous lawyer like Qian Heng.

457
00:29:00,163 --> 00:29:02,262
You don't need to prove yourself to anyone.

458
00:29:02,343 --> 00:29:03,892
You are unique.

459
00:29:05,221 --> 00:29:06,431
I hope so.

460
00:29:07,574 --> 00:29:09,284
He said I have influenced him.

461
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:12,772
I hope this influence is a positive one.

462
00:29:13,779 --> 00:29:14,989
Excuse me for a call.

463
00:29:15,285 --> 00:29:16,766
- Senior.   - (Cheng Yao.)

464
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,349
(Chen Lin Li attempted to commit suicide.)

465
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,350
Ms. Chen.

466
00:29:35,754 --> 00:29:36,795
How are you?

467
00:29:36,916 --> 00:29:38,126
Are you okay?

468
00:29:39,567 --> 00:29:40,777
I'm fine.

469
00:29:41,478 --> 00:29:42,722
Please sit.

470
00:29:50,766 --> 00:29:52,275
Is it because of the case?

471
00:29:52,975 --> 00:29:55,246
Ms. Chen, please believe me.

472
00:29:55,588 --> 00:29:58,099
I will do my best to help you get the justice you deserve.

473
00:30:01,061 --> 00:30:04,802
Today is Kai's birthday.

474
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,562
I have

475
00:30:10,532 --> 00:30:14,082
many shared online accounts with Kai.

476
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,780
When I woke up this morning,

477
00:30:18,166 --> 00:30:19,876
I received many

478
00:30:20,556 --> 00:30:22,362
birthday wishes for Kai.

479
00:30:22,813 --> 00:30:27,882
Then, I thought about getting him his favorite birthday cake

480
00:30:28,236 --> 00:30:29,985
at the bakery.

481
00:30:31,109 --> 00:30:32,319
But then

482
00:30:37,395 --> 00:30:39,265
it suddenly hit me

483
00:30:42,076 --> 00:30:43,426
that Kai is no longer here.

484
00:30:45,029 --> 00:30:46,882
And there are no more birthdays for him.

485
00:30:47,036 --> 00:30:48,627
Forever.

486
00:30:52,276 --> 00:30:53,625
I just feel like

487
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:56,002
what's the point

488
00:30:57,442 --> 00:30:59,522
of me being alive without him?

489
00:31:04,068 --> 00:31:05,278
Ms. Chen.

490
00:31:06,116 --> 00:31:08,026
I understand the pain of losing a loved one

491
00:31:09,012 --> 00:31:10,762
but life must go on.

492
00:31:10,885 --> 00:31:12,095
I know.

493
00:31:13,236 --> 00:31:15,482
But today, I really couldn't hold on.

494
00:31:17,673 --> 00:31:19,343
May I ask

495
00:31:19,989 --> 00:31:21,578
why you want Kaili?

496
00:31:22,565 --> 00:31:24,515
Kaili is the company that Kai and I

497
00:31:25,124 --> 00:31:26,682
built together,

498
00:31:27,226 --> 00:31:29,226
step by step.

499
00:31:29,877 --> 00:31:31,402
Now that Kai is gone

500
00:31:31,491 --> 00:31:32,800
and Ran is gone too,

501
00:31:33,436 --> 00:31:35,825
Kaili is my only memory.

502
00:31:36,166 --> 00:31:38,242
Then, why don't you want to give it to your mother-in-law?

503
00:31:39,436 --> 00:31:41,802
I actually have no ill will toward my mother-in-law.

504
00:31:42,098 --> 00:31:43,962
I also want to build a good relationship with her.

505
00:31:44,501 --> 00:31:46,002
But my mother-in-law

506
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:48,762
has no knowledge of business management.

507
00:31:49,012 --> 00:31:51,323
She also doesn't understand the significance of Kaili to me.

508
00:31:52,052 --> 00:31:53,133
She always thinks

509
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:55,580
that I am with Kai for money.

510
00:31:56,516 --> 00:31:59,145
If she gets the shares, she will definitely sell them off.

511
00:31:59,678 --> 00:32:01,802
She might even go against me

512
00:32:02,043 --> 00:32:03,632
and do everything in reverse.

513
00:32:03,991 --> 00:32:05,750
Plus, at this critical moment,

514
00:32:05,869 --> 00:32:09,299
there are many people wanting to take advantage of the situation.

515
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,700
If my mother-in-law gets the shares,

516
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:14,661
and those small shareholders turn against me,

517
00:32:14,756 --> 00:32:17,316
then it's very likely that I won't be able to control the company.

518
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,443
By then, Kaili will be like a fish on the chopping block.

519
00:32:20,548 --> 00:32:22,057
They will only think about

520
00:32:22,461 --> 00:32:25,797
raising Kaili's stock price and quickly selling it off,

521
00:32:25,891 --> 00:32:27,391
then leaving without hesitation.

522
00:32:27,508 --> 00:32:30,002
I have seen many instances where short-term manipulation

523
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:31,772
has destroyed numerous companies that had

524
00:32:31,852 --> 00:32:33,562
the potential for long-term development.

525
00:32:34,532 --> 00:32:37,941
So I absolutely won't allow such a thing to happen to Kaili.

526
00:32:39,133 --> 00:32:41,442
It is my and Kai's only hard work.

527
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:48,759
Don't worry.

528
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,922
(When the accident happened,)

529
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:56,162
(several of our compatriots stopped their journey)

530
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:58,468
(and especially accompanied me to the hospital.)

531
00:32:58,998 --> 00:33:00,588
(They even paid for my medical expenses.)

532
00:33:02,061 --> 00:33:04,050
(We asked all the lawyers we could find.)

533
00:33:04,715 --> 00:33:06,225
It was chaotic at the time.

534
00:33:07,013 --> 00:33:10,002
No one knew how Kai and Ran died.

535
00:33:11,896 --> 00:33:13,882
Were you at the scene of the accident that day?

536
00:33:13,964 --> 00:33:18,042
Yes, I was at the scene. I was traveling abroad with my wife.

537
00:33:18,195 --> 00:33:20,762
We were walking and taking photos.

538
00:33:20,956 --> 00:33:24,562
And then suddenly we saw something falling from the sky.

539
00:33:24,688 --> 00:33:26,407
You said you took some photos. Do you have the photos?

540
00:33:26,488 --> 00:33:29,094
My camera was broken. There were too many people that day.

541
00:33:43,453 --> 00:33:45,782
Okay, let's go. Let's go see the new office.

542
00:33:50,493 --> 00:33:51,703
Come here, Cheng Xi.

543
00:33:51,916 --> 00:33:53,306
This will be your office from now on.

544
00:33:53,387 --> 00:33:54,597
How do you like it?

545
00:33:57,473 --> 00:33:59,502
I personally decorated it.

546
00:34:02,364 --> 00:34:04,162
Do we have to use this wallpaper?

547
00:34:04,356 --> 00:34:06,118
It's so nice. You can see me smile every day.

548
00:34:06,199 --> 00:34:07,889
I really like this photo of us.

549
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:10,381
Today is your first day at work.

550
00:34:10,462 --> 00:34:13,962
If there's anything you need or any questions,

551
00:34:14,077 --> 00:34:15,282
just ask me anytime.

552
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:19,165
Try sitting in the chair I specially prepared for you.

553
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,091
- Okay.   - Is it comfortable and soft enough?

554
00:34:23,556 --> 00:34:25,001
- Very comfortable.   - Is it okay?

555
00:34:25,082 --> 00:34:26,111
Yes.

556
00:34:39,415 --> 00:34:41,045
Are they all afraid of Qian Heng?

557
00:34:43,804 --> 00:34:45,924
He became like this after the argument with Cheng Yao.

558
00:34:46,036 --> 00:34:49,016
He is in a bad mood every day.

559
00:34:49,181 --> 00:34:50,762
So my colleagues all keep their distance from him

560
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:52,500
to avoid being affected by his bad mood.

561
00:34:52,698 --> 00:34:54,522
Don't pay attention to him. He'll be fine in a couple of days.

562
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,642
Senior.

563
00:35:23,116 --> 00:35:24,242
Qian Heng.

564
00:35:24,499 --> 00:35:26,550
- Senior.   - Sorry to bother you.

565
00:35:27,092 --> 00:35:29,002
I just started working today

566
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:30,833
and Wu Jun arranged for me to go on a business trip.

567
00:35:31,413 --> 00:35:33,123
There's no one to take care of it.

568
00:35:33,261 --> 00:35:35,672
Can you please take care of it for me?

569
00:35:36,596 --> 00:35:38,990
I don't have much experience. I've never taken care of a dog before.

570
00:35:40,113 --> 00:35:43,635
It's quite presumptuous of me but I asked Wu Jun and Yao Yao

571
00:35:43,739 --> 00:35:45,328
and they're both really busy.

572
00:35:45,522 --> 00:35:46,993
I couldn't find anyone else.

573
00:35:47,232 --> 00:35:48,722
Then, I'll give it a try.

574
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,682
- Thank you.   - No problem.

575
00:35:50,936 --> 00:35:52,146
Come on.

576
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:56,122
- These are other things for it.   - Okay.

577
00:35:58,562 --> 00:36:00,042
Thank you for your help.

578
00:36:00,536 --> 00:36:01,746
Senior,

579
00:36:03,156 --> 00:36:05,506
how is Cheng Yao doing lately?

580
00:36:07,685 --> 00:36:09,402
She said she's doing pretty well.

581
00:36:09,564 --> 00:36:11,124
But whether she's really doing well or not,

582
00:36:11,219 --> 00:36:12,429
I don't know.

583
00:36:14,123 --> 00:36:16,563
Do I still have a chance to make things right?

584
00:36:18,636 --> 00:36:20,027
Let me tell you something.

585
00:36:20,521 --> 00:36:22,882
When I was younger, I had good grades.

586
00:36:23,461 --> 00:36:26,057
My parents told me to work harder

587
00:36:26,236 --> 00:36:27,996
so I could take good care of my younger sister.

588
00:36:28,134 --> 00:36:31,322
But one day, Yao Yao came to me and said she was very sad

589
00:36:31,403 --> 00:36:35,123
because our parents never told her to take good care of me.

590
00:36:36,256 --> 00:36:37,685
She told me before.

591
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,420
She hopes one day she can protect you.

592
00:36:40,725 --> 00:36:41,795
Yes.

593
00:36:42,106 --> 00:36:44,097
She's very strong and hardworking.

594
00:36:44,406 --> 00:36:47,275
So she cares even more about whether she's good enough.

595
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,830
Do you understand?

596
00:36:51,814 --> 00:36:53,402
So I'm counting on you for Wei Zhen Tian.

597
00:36:53,561 --> 00:36:55,762
If there's anything you don't understand, just call me.

598
00:36:55,988 --> 00:36:57,459
You can also call Yao Yao.

599
00:37:00,444 --> 00:37:01,654
Goodbye, Senior.

600
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:12,189
Wei Zhen Tian.

601
00:37:12,357 --> 00:37:14,240
You're not allowed to pee everywhere. Don't destroy my house.

602
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,722
Be a good listener.

603
00:37:15,821 --> 00:37:17,031
You...

604
00:37:26,436 --> 00:37:27,646
Meet up tonight, right?

605
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,760
I have time. Of course, I have time.

606
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:39,929
Wei Zhen Tian, you're my lucky star.

607
00:37:42,556 --> 00:37:43,596
You...

608
00:37:43,677 --> 00:37:45,802
Are you afraid of heights?

609
00:37:45,956 --> 00:37:47,522
It's okay. Don't be scared.

610
00:38:07,094 --> 00:38:08,304
Sorry.

611
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:09,882
I've been really busy lately.

612
00:38:10,156 --> 00:38:12,442
I haven't contacted you. Don't be mad.

613
00:38:12,607 --> 00:38:13,857
I asked you out because I wanted to talk to you

614
00:38:13,938 --> 00:38:15,568
about the case of Chen Lin Li and Huang Ran.

615
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:19,882
You... Did you ask me out to talk about the case?

616
00:38:20,014 --> 00:38:21,224
Otherwise?

617
00:38:21,636 --> 00:38:23,746
You agreed to meet me. Wasn't it to talk about the case?

618
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:30,042
Okay, here's the thing.

619
00:38:31,037 --> 00:38:33,002
I want to attempt to facilitate a meeting

620
00:38:33,149 --> 00:38:35,402
between the two litigants, Chen Lin Li and Huang Ran.

621
00:38:35,884 --> 00:38:39,633
I hope we can negotiate a pre-trial settlement before the second trial.

622
00:38:39,862 --> 00:38:40,982
That's impossible.

623
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,890
Huang Ran has no intention of seeing Chen Lin Li

624
00:38:43,078 --> 00:38:44,762
and there is absolutely no possibility of a settlement.

625
00:38:45,596 --> 00:38:47,021
That's because Huang Ran believes that

626
00:38:47,109 --> 00:38:49,002
Chen Lin Li was only with her son for the money.

627
00:38:49,837 --> 00:38:51,306
But that's not the truth.

628
00:38:52,245 --> 00:38:54,084
Chen Lin Li loves Zhang Kai very much,

629
00:38:54,275 --> 00:38:55,626
even more than herself.

630
00:38:58,997 --> 00:39:01,802
Her intention for wanting Kaili Culture is not to fight for inheritance.

631
00:39:01,933 --> 00:39:04,052
If Huang Ran could know this fact,

632
00:39:04,171 --> 00:39:05,482
there is a possibility of a settlement.

633
00:39:05,565 --> 00:39:07,642
Cheng Yao, I have taught you before

634
00:39:07,865 --> 00:39:09,202
to stay away from the litigants involved.

635
00:39:09,377 --> 00:39:11,482
Don't believe in their stories.

636
00:39:11,596 --> 00:39:13,845
Just focus on their demands.

637
00:39:14,698 --> 00:39:16,074
Besides, I have said before

638
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:17,842
that love can be pure

639
00:39:17,948 --> 00:39:19,442
but marriage is impossible.

640
00:39:19,645 --> 00:39:21,802
There are too many interests involved in marriage

641
00:39:21,883 --> 00:39:24,482
and it eventually turns into a war of interests under the guise of love.

642
00:39:24,724 --> 00:39:27,562
Think about it. If Chen Lin Li really doesn't care about the money,

643
00:39:27,643 --> 00:39:29,893
how come she still couldn't let go after the first trial?

644
00:39:31,093 --> 00:39:32,803
I will always remember your guidance.

645
00:39:35,192 --> 00:39:38,063
Likewise, I won't blindly believe the words of the litigant.

646
00:39:39,904 --> 00:39:42,218
But everything I do and any conclusions I draw

647
00:39:42,299 --> 00:39:43,730
are based on solid evidence.

648
00:39:43,942 --> 00:39:45,862
I won't make the same mistake twice.

649
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:51,521
No, that's not what I meant. What I mean is...

650
00:39:51,602 --> 00:39:53,427
A lawyer who only cares about the client's demands

651
00:39:53,508 --> 00:39:55,199
is safe and understandable.

652
00:39:55,349 --> 00:39:59,642
But, if he can understand the intentions behind the client's demands,

653
00:40:00,404 --> 00:40:02,873
I believe it will also greatly affect the outcome of the case.

654
00:40:08,782 --> 00:40:09,992
Qian Heng,

655
00:40:10,837 --> 00:40:12,402
a lawyer needs professionalism

656
00:40:12,798 --> 00:40:14,278
but also compassion.

657
00:40:19,129 --> 00:40:20,712
Here are the materials I've compiled.

658
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:23,255
There are witness testimonies inside. Take a look.

659
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:34,842
Chen Lin Li attempted suicide once.

660
00:40:35,488 --> 00:40:37,808
I know Huang Ran will definitely think she's just putting on a show.

661
00:40:39,355 --> 00:40:41,675
But this video came from a witness of the accident.

662
00:40:41,818 --> 00:40:43,075
It's not fake and there's no editing.

663
00:40:43,156 --> 00:40:45,242
If you don't believe it, you can go and verify it.

664
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:47,322
On the day of the accident, Chen Lin Li was also injured

665
00:40:47,443 --> 00:40:48,842
and suffered a concussion.

666
00:40:49,576 --> 00:40:51,709
I believe that most people in her situation

667
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:53,562
would ask for help for themselves first.

668
00:40:53,892 --> 00:40:55,404
But Chen Lin Li's first reaction was

669
00:40:55,485 --> 00:40:57,295
to ask for help for her husband and her son.

670
00:40:57,376 --> 00:40:59,447
(Save my husband and my son first.)

671
00:40:59,982 --> 00:41:01,192
Because of love,

672
00:41:01,932 --> 00:41:04,682
she has even overcome the most selfish instinct of self-preservation.

673
00:41:05,756 --> 00:41:08,276
Do you still believe that she only married Zhang Kai for her own benefit?

674
00:41:20,154 --> 00:41:21,784
I have always believed that

675
00:41:22,325 --> 00:41:24,442
the law is cold and neutral.

676
00:41:26,043 --> 00:41:27,713
But, as lawyers, I think we can consider

677
00:41:29,179 --> 00:41:32,449
a little more human touch beyond the rationality of the law.

678
00:41:33,596 --> 00:41:35,877
This will not only not affect professionalism,

679
00:41:36,005 --> 00:41:38,494
but it can even make a lawyer better.

680
00:41:43,197 --> 00:41:44,252
Of course,

681
00:41:44,333 --> 00:41:46,482
I admit that my abilities are not as good as yours.

682
00:41:46,708 --> 00:41:48,670
But many times, your understanding of the profession

683
00:41:48,751 --> 00:41:50,261
is not something I fully agree with.

684
00:41:51,556 --> 00:41:54,436
If we must use litigation to resolve this dispute,

685
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:56,067
my chances of winning are small.

686
00:41:56,334 --> 00:41:59,404
It's too difficult to overturn a cross-border death certificate.

687
00:42:02,134 --> 00:42:03,344
So I was thinking,

688
00:42:05,276 --> 00:42:09,676
can we consider using other methods to resolve this dispute?

689
00:42:10,156 --> 00:42:12,027
Lawyers are conflict resolvers.

690
00:42:12,586 --> 00:42:13,796
But

691
00:42:14,966 --> 00:42:17,355
the way to resolve conflicts is not limited to litigation.

692
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:21,176
Family disputes can also be resolved through reconciliation.

693
00:42:21,429 --> 00:42:22,607
Chen Lin Li loves Zhang Kai.

694
00:42:22,688 --> 00:42:23,888
Huang Ran also loves him.

695
00:42:24,379 --> 00:42:26,825
They are greatly affected by this accident.

696
00:42:27,036 --> 00:42:29,587
They both love the deceased. Why can't they reconcile?

697
00:42:30,806 --> 00:42:32,016
Cheng Yao.

698
00:42:32,365 --> 00:42:34,384
I have been fighting lawsuits for so many years.

699
00:42:34,495 --> 00:42:38,015
My principle is to help my litigant gain more benefits.

700
00:42:38,277 --> 00:42:40,458
When interests conflict between two litigants,

701
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,082
how can reconciliation be achieved?

702
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:43,722
It's just a strategy.

703
00:42:43,814 --> 00:42:44,893
Really.

704
00:42:44,974 --> 00:42:45,990
No,

705
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:49,682
what I want is a complete reconciliation.

706
00:42:51,853 --> 00:42:54,282
I want to prove that marriage not only protects property,

707
00:42:54,517 --> 00:42:56,148
but also protects love.

708
00:42:57,154 --> 00:42:59,766
Even if one party leaves, love will still exist.

709
00:43:00,886 --> 00:43:03,076
The love will never disappear.
