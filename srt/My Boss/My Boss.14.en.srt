1
00:01:35,589 --> 00:01:38,962
(My Boss)

2
00:01:39,987 --> 00:01:42,548
(Episode 14)

3
00:01:42,629 --> 00:01:46,242
(Cheng Yao. With me here, you don't need to tolerate anything.)

4
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:01,790
Boss.

5
00:02:05,194 --> 00:02:06,544
Boss.

6
00:02:08,602 --> 00:02:14,071
Boss, I will definitely control myself and not let you down.

7
00:02:15,113 --> 00:02:17,103
Really, I won't

8
00:02:18,422 --> 00:02:20,802
disappoint you.

9
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:25,991
Boss, what's wrong?

10
00:02:29,954 --> 00:02:31,136
Why aren't you sleeping in your own bed?

11
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,202
Why did you take my spot?

12
00:02:33,171 --> 00:02:34,600
I took your spot?

13
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,350
You don't even remember, do you?

14
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:42,161
Okay, let me help you remember.

15
00:02:43,008 --> 00:02:45,051
Last night, someone sneaked into my bed in the dark

16
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:46,469
and even took my blanket.

17
00:02:46,563 --> 00:02:47,848
It's one thing you took my blanket,

18
00:02:47,872 --> 00:02:50,452
but you also pushed me to the side.

19
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,985
I could only sleep on this side. That's not all.

20
00:02:53,094 --> 00:02:54,570
From this side, you still pushed me.

21
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,442
So, I could only sleep on this edge.

22
00:02:56,657 --> 00:02:59,261
The worst part is, you gave me an elbow strike and a knee strike.

23
00:02:59,342 --> 00:03:00,602
And, I ended up on your bed.

24
00:03:35,696 --> 00:03:36,996
Really?

25
00:03:37,809 --> 00:03:39,562
Why don't I remember anything?

26
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,336
It must not be my fault.

27
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:42,638
It's probably your fault.

28
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:44,030
My fault?

29
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,051
Right.

30
00:03:49,201 --> 00:03:50,642
It's my fault.

31
00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:54,162
My biggest mistake was letting you in my room.

32
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,642
What did I say last night?

33
00:03:55,864 --> 00:03:57,455
As expected, you turned against me.

34
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,322
Now, please leave my room.

35
00:03:59,431 --> 00:04:00,731
Get out.

36
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:03,282
Hurry up.

37
00:04:08,345 --> 00:04:09,645
It hurts so much.

38
00:04:27,477 --> 00:04:31,242
- Mr. Tang. - Lawyer Qian. I'm in a rush this time.

39
00:04:31,323 --> 00:04:32,839
I'm sorry to trouble you to make another trip.

40
00:04:32,863 --> 00:04:34,163
You're too polite.

41
00:04:38,555 --> 00:04:40,469
Lawyer Qian, I didn't expect you to bring

42
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,242
a female assistant on your business trip.

43
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,471
Mr. Tang.

44
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,786
Our firm doesn't differentiate between male and female assistants.

45
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,899
This is my colleague, Lawyer Cheng Yao.

46
00:04:49,086 --> 00:04:50,401
She is highly professional and fully capable

47
00:04:50,425 --> 00:04:52,042
of handling your company's case.

48
00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:55,129
I have thought too much about your relationship.

49
00:04:56,094 --> 00:04:58,797
- Hello, Lawyer Cheng. - Hello, Mr. Tang.

50
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,407
I am not good. I am only good when you both are here.

51
00:05:01,488 --> 00:05:03,242
Mr. Tang, let's save time.

52
00:05:05,385 --> 00:05:06,685
Let's go.

53
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:16,723
This time, I invited you not only to discuss the family trust matter,

54
00:05:16,868 --> 00:05:19,620
but also to ask you and Lawyer Cheng

55
00:05:20,113 --> 00:05:24,327
to help us plan the future ownership structure of the company.

56
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,802
All the documents you need are prepared and placed in the conference room.

57
00:05:27,923 --> 00:05:30,173
When we get to the conference room, we will thoroughly study and discuss.

58
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:31,482
Hello, Mr. Tang.

59
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,980
Keep it up.

60
00:05:35,975 --> 00:05:37,275
Tiffany.

61
00:05:37,507 --> 00:05:39,355
I really like your hairstyle design today.

62
00:05:39,436 --> 00:05:42,215
But, please change the shade of your lipstick to the one I gave you,

63
00:05:42,296 --> 00:05:43,922
which is Blue Enchantress Purple, okay?

64
00:05:44,002 --> 00:05:45,302
Thank you, Mr. Tang.

65
00:05:46,593 --> 00:05:48,642
Look. This is our company culture.

66
00:05:48,762 --> 00:05:51,313
It's just so harmonious. Come on, please.

67
00:05:53,897 --> 00:05:55,412
We've arrived at the conference room. Please.

68
00:05:55,436 --> 00:05:56,949
(Business Leader)

69
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,216
The steps are a bit high, let me help you.

70
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,402
No need. Thank you.

71
00:06:05,606 --> 00:06:07,079
Lawyer Qian, Lawyer Cheng.

72
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,082
Before you start handling the situation of our company,

73
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,149
let me introduce our four senior executives.

74
00:06:13,838 --> 00:06:15,079
Legal Director.

75
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,709
I hired him from France.

76
00:06:17,236 --> 00:06:18,476
Marketing Director.

77
00:06:18,581 --> 00:06:20,162
I hired him from the United Kingdom.

78
00:06:20,561 --> 00:06:21,641
Human Resources Director.

79
00:06:21,722 --> 00:06:23,322
I hired him from the United States.

80
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:24,974
Finance Director.

81
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,069
My wife brought her from her parents' home.

82
00:06:27,499 --> 00:06:29,628
There's no other way. If women don't control the money,

83
00:06:29,652 --> 00:06:30,802
they won't feel secure.

84
00:06:30,883 --> 00:06:32,066
But,

85
00:06:32,247 --> 00:06:33,877
she's already on my side now.

86
00:06:34,757 --> 00:06:36,722
Mr. Tang. Let's begin.

87
00:06:37,157 --> 00:06:39,137
Let's start. You four.

88
00:06:39,218 --> 00:06:40,602
Follow my example from earlier.

89
00:06:40,846 --> 00:06:43,275
Have no secrets and nothing left unsaid to the two lawyers.

90
00:06:43,423 --> 00:06:44,723
All right, let's begin.

91
00:07:22,674 --> 00:07:24,522
(If I knew there wouldn't be any food, )

92
00:07:24,609 --> 00:07:26,442
(I should have eaten more before leaving.)

93
00:07:26,841 --> 00:07:29,160
(Now, everyone is immersed in work.)

94
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,671
(And, I'm the only one feeling dizzy due to hunger.)

95
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,430
(It's so embarrassing.)

96
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,642
(Is he a robot?)

97
00:07:42,887 --> 00:07:45,247
(He can go a whole day without eating and not feel hungry.)

98
00:07:56,412 --> 00:07:57,613
Cheng Yao,

99
00:07:57,787 --> 00:07:59,226
call Bao Rui.

100
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,042
He has some documents in my bag.

101
00:08:01,198 --> 00:08:02,629
Read it to him.

102
00:08:03,057 --> 00:08:04,357
What materials?

103
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:07,054
He just sent me a WeChat message, saying it's urgent.

104
00:08:07,078 --> 00:08:08,562
- Go now. - Okay.

105
00:08:18,205 --> 00:08:21,510
(It's strange. What case materials have Bao not backed up?)

106
00:08:21,777 --> 00:08:23,577
(Why does he have to get them from the boss?)

107
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,951
(No need to call Bao Rui.)

108
00:08:37,018 --> 00:08:38,318
(I have chocolate in my bag.)

109
00:08:38,739 --> 00:08:40,039
(Eat outside.)

110
00:08:47,174 --> 00:08:48,737
(Boss, did you deliberately find an excuse)

111
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:50,272
(to let me eat outside?)

112
00:08:54,636 --> 00:08:56,682
(Your stomach growling is bothering me.)

113
00:09:12,163 --> 00:09:14,363
(Don't worry. Just eat it. It's not cilantro-flavored.)

114
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:47,562
(Later, I'll find an excuse to invite him to eat outside.)

115
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,762
Mr. Tang,

116
00:10:03,216 --> 00:10:05,799
I suggest gradually transitioning all natural person shares

117
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,202
to be held by a holding company.

118
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,236
In addition, from a reasonable tax avoidance perspective,

119
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,343
holding companies have greater room for development

120
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,120
in terms of equity dividends,

121
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,771
transfers and conversion of undistributed profits into equity capital.

122
00:10:16,795 --> 00:10:19,922
(His look when he works is really attractive.)

123
00:10:20,406 --> 00:10:23,562
(No wonder his previous dozens of assistants all fell for him.)

124
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:26,624
Cheng Yao.

125
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,229
Do you have anything to add?

126
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:32,070
I just took a closer look

127
00:10:32,151 --> 00:10:34,191
at the company's personnel and financial situation.

128
00:10:34,359 --> 00:10:37,302
I found that some employees' labor contract liability clauses are vague

129
00:10:37,435 --> 00:10:39,075
and can easily lead to misunderstandings.

130
00:10:39,351 --> 00:10:41,487
I suggest we revise them uniformly

131
00:10:41,751 --> 00:10:43,282
or sign supplementary agreements.

132
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,840
Anything else?

133
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:51,922
For example,

134
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,602
this type of labor contract

135
00:10:53,744 --> 00:10:58,922
is usually for temporary workers hired for a period of one to two months

136
00:10:59,163 --> 00:11:00,601
with the longest being six months.

137
00:11:00,718 --> 00:11:02,009
There is a high turnover rate for employees,

138
00:11:02,033 --> 00:11:05,362
which can indirectly increase the management burden for the HR department

139
00:11:05,442 --> 00:11:07,042
and workload for the finance department.

140
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,265
It is recommended to adjust this type of casual labor to

141
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,656
the labor dispatch model.

142
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:15,162
This can reduce the hidden costs of business operations,

143
00:11:15,235 --> 00:11:16,535
improving efficiency.

144
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,479
Every word of yours is a gem.

145
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,350
It's thought-provoking, everyone.

146
00:11:24,452 --> 00:11:25,562
Mr. Qian,

147
00:11:25,793 --> 00:11:28,704
this is called "no weak soldiers under a strong general."

148
00:11:28,937 --> 00:11:30,136
Look at these two individuals.

149
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,563
In just one afternoon,

150
00:11:31,675 --> 00:11:34,225
they have clearly sorted out our company.

151
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,719
Did you see that, everyone?

152
00:11:35,846 --> 00:11:37,596
This is what professionalism means.

153
00:11:37,942 --> 00:11:39,802
This is what ability means.

154
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:41,918
This is what "when people of opposite genders work together,

155
00:11:41,942 --> 00:11:43,125
it's not tiring at all" means.

156
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:44,679
They not only don't get tired,

157
00:11:44,814 --> 00:11:46,685
but everything they say is also on point.

158
00:11:47,697 --> 00:11:49,082
What are you waiting for?

159
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,540
Clap your hands!

160
00:11:52,443 --> 00:11:53,642
Great!

161
00:11:54,794 --> 00:11:56,105
Very good!

162
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,442
After hearing what you guys said,

163
00:12:01,575 --> 00:12:03,562
my mind is now clear.

164
00:12:04,643 --> 00:12:07,867
Lawyer Qian, I have something to take care of tonight.

165
00:12:07,984 --> 00:12:10,762
I won't accompany you guys. Let the driver take you back first.

166
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,109
Tomorrow, I'll treat you both to a meal.

167
00:12:13,249 --> 00:12:16,624
About the family trust matter, let's talk about it over the meal.

168
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,642
- See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow.

169
00:12:20,132 --> 00:12:21,559
Be careful of your head.

170
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,881
Thank you, Mr. Tang.

171
00:12:22,962 --> 00:12:24,262
You're welcome.

172
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:26,758
See you later.

173
00:12:26,878 --> 00:12:27,928
What's wrong?

174
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,340
It's nothing. Let's go.

175
00:12:49,165 --> 00:12:50,465
Boss, what's wrong?

176
00:12:52,695 --> 00:12:54,322
Is your stomach not feeling well?

177
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,137
You have chocolate in your bag. Do you want to eat some?

178
00:12:56,161 --> 00:12:57,682
It's nothing, just my old problem.

179
00:13:02,146 --> 00:13:03,682
I really don't understand.

180
00:13:03,913 --> 00:13:06,242
You're already the boss, but you're still so stressed out.

181
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:08,535
You have trouble sleeping and stomach pains.

182
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,120
Did you not care about your life at all before becoming the boss?

183
00:13:14,537 --> 00:13:16,042
This is an issue with work attitude.

184
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,920
It has nothing to do with me being the boss.

185
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:23,945
Do you really not need to eat some chocolate?

186
00:13:59,885 --> 00:14:03,642
(Boss, is Tang Group's financial statement with you?)

187
00:14:28,904 --> 00:14:30,762
(Boss?)

188
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,162
Have you fainted due to hunger?

189
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:41,642
Okay, fine.

190
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,382
Since you treated me to chocolate,

191
00:14:45,463 --> 00:14:47,183
I'll reluctantly show some concern for you.

192
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:08,002
Boss, are you in there?

193
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:15,642
- What's wrong? - I ordered some porridge for you.

194
00:15:16,009 --> 00:15:17,082
Okay.

195
00:15:19,303 --> 00:15:21,322
Boss. Wait a minute.

196
00:15:27,335 --> 00:15:28,518
What are you looking at?

197
00:15:29,124 --> 00:15:30,896
Don't even think about using last night's incident to blackmail me.

198
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,296
That's impossible.

199
00:15:32,382 --> 00:15:35,922
I just wanted to show my concern for you. What are you thinking?

200
00:15:36,046 --> 00:15:38,052
And, about last night, I didn't mean to do it on purpose.

201
00:15:38,076 --> 00:15:40,116
If it's a big deal, I'm the one taken advantage of.

202
00:15:44,904 --> 00:15:45,962
Fine.

203
00:15:46,288 --> 00:15:48,482
If you really think I took advantage of you,

204
00:15:48,733 --> 00:15:50,949
I can find a way to make it up to you.

205
00:15:51,203 --> 00:15:53,602
But, let's not mention this again in the future.

206
00:15:54,792 --> 00:15:56,282
Boss, please don't do this.

207
00:15:58,468 --> 00:15:59,842
I didn't mean that.

208
00:16:00,931 --> 00:16:03,362
Cheng Yao, don't be too much.

209
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,251
Boss, you're overthinking. I didn't mean that.

210
00:16:06,854 --> 00:16:08,282
Then, why did you come to my room?

211
00:16:08,514 --> 00:16:11,839
I'm afraid you'll just put the porridge aside and go to work.

212
00:16:11,935 --> 00:16:13,975
So, I wanted to watch you finish it before leaving.

213
00:16:17,526 --> 00:16:19,117
You eat. I won't eat.

214
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,519
Boss, eat a little bit.

215
00:16:22,632 --> 00:16:24,082
This is specially for you.

216
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:26,959
You can eat it. I'm not hungry.

217
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,430
I have a lot of work to do.

218
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,961
You're not hungry because you've already been too hungry.

219
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:33,681
If you're often too hungry till you avoid meals,

220
00:16:33,705 --> 00:16:35,042
this will ruin your stomach.

221
00:16:35,886 --> 00:16:37,186
That's my business.

222
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:43,166
How about this?

223
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:44,517
As long as you eat,

224
00:16:44,652 --> 00:16:46,415
I'll give up five days of paid leave.

225
00:16:46,496 --> 00:16:47,796
How does that sound?

226
00:16:51,716 --> 00:16:54,267
Plus one month of cleaning service.

227
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,780
It tastes terrible.

228
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,470
But, this is made by a five-star hotel.

229
00:17:15,671 --> 00:17:17,221
Top chef.

230
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,630
You cook better.

231
00:17:23,932 --> 00:17:26,749
Fine. Since you're my boss,

232
00:17:27,393 --> 00:17:29,802
I must personally cook for you.

233
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,180
Wait a moment.

234
00:18:39,204 --> 00:18:40,282
Done.

235
00:18:44,628 --> 00:18:46,178
Boss, you can eat now.

236
00:18:51,443 --> 00:18:53,602
I knew you wouldn't be able to eat.

237
00:19:14,627 --> 00:19:15,927
Thank you.

238
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,802
Boss, did I hear wrong just now?

239
00:19:23,282 --> 00:19:24,762
Don't push it too far.

240
00:19:25,155 --> 00:19:27,865
I mean I'm afraid I misunderstood your instructions.

241
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,162
- Did you just say... - Thank you.

242
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,344
In your dictionary, there is actually the phrase "thank you."

243
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:40,279
I just added it.

244
00:19:43,296 --> 00:19:45,496
Remember to eat it while it's hot. Be careful not to burn yourself.

245
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,820
I'm going to bed now.

246
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,080
I didn't expect the intensity of this business trip to be so high.

247
00:20:31,467 --> 00:20:33,108
I also have to take care of his stomach.

248
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,749
Luckily, I was prepared early.

249
00:20:37,452 --> 00:20:39,996
(I finished my porridge. Give up five days of paid annual leave.)

250
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,660
(And, the one month of cleaning service is effective immediately.)

251
00:20:57,081 --> 00:20:59,722
Boss, I just said that to make you drink the porridge.

252
00:20:59,874 --> 00:21:01,456
Drinking porridge is also for your own good.

253
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,962
Can you not count on it?

254
00:21:13,434 --> 00:21:15,154
(When we verbally agreed, )

255
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,292
(there was no coercion, and I did not deceive you.)

256
00:21:17,316 --> 00:21:19,096
(You are not a person without legal capacity)

257
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,772
(or a person with limited legal capacity.)

258
00:21:20,796 --> 00:21:23,796
(There're no conditions that would make the contract revocable or invalid.)

259
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,880
- Are you crazy? - (I have followed the terms...)

260
00:21:25,947 --> 00:21:29,767
If I show any pity toward you, I won't be surnamed Cheng!

261
00:21:34,715 --> 00:21:36,015
Please, both of you.

262
00:21:37,122 --> 00:21:38,162
Mr. Tang.

263
00:21:39,168 --> 00:21:41,304
Thank you for coming.

264
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,242
Lawyer Cheng.

265
00:21:43,425 --> 00:21:44,984
Today, you are the only lady among us.

266
00:21:45,135 --> 00:21:47,485
We are like two green leaves surrounding a red flower.

267
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:50,442
Lawyer Cheng, you sit in the middle.

268
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,509
Sure, then I'll be the red flower.

269
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,060
Lawyer Cheng. You sit...

270
00:22:01,239 --> 00:22:03,559
Sure. We coincidentally prefer the same seat.

271
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,722
Service.

272
00:22:08,008 --> 00:22:09,122
My guests.

273
00:22:10,217 --> 00:22:13,922
This is a wine I asked the Italian modern wine master, John, to make.

274
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:16,386
It is a newly brewed wine which combines grapes

275
00:22:16,467 --> 00:22:18,715
from China, America, England, France, and Russia.

276
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:20,394
One glass of wine brought together

277
00:22:20,475 --> 00:22:22,161
the five permanent members of the United Nations.

278
00:22:22,185 --> 00:22:23,319
What a grand perspective.

279
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,046
Let's taste it carefully.

280
00:22:25,249 --> 00:22:27,608
Mr. Tang, I don't drink while working.

281
00:22:27,689 --> 00:22:28,882
Understood.

282
00:22:29,171 --> 00:22:30,343
I respect you.

283
00:22:30,624 --> 00:22:33,385
Then, we can just talk about work while drinking, right? Lawyer Qian.

284
00:22:33,597 --> 00:22:35,117
For the sake of the grand perspective,

285
00:22:35,346 --> 00:22:36,479
let's make an exception.

286
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,830
Sorry, it's my rule.

287
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,042
You can be a bit stubborn.

288
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,282
What about you, Lawyer Cheng?

289
00:22:44,469 --> 00:22:46,568
Since Lawyer Qian doesn't want to drink, will you have a drink with me?

290
00:22:46,592 --> 00:22:47,922
There's an old saying,

291
00:22:48,054 --> 00:22:50,002
"good wine goes well with a beautiful woman."

292
00:22:50,248 --> 00:22:51,548
Don't think too much.

293
00:22:51,808 --> 00:22:53,808
What I mean is, after we finish this drink,

294
00:22:53,966 --> 00:22:55,637
we'll be like family.

295
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:01,962
(I never expected to encounter a situation like this even at Junheng & Co.)

296
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,110
(Boss just had stomach pain. He definitely can't drink alcohol.)

297
00:23:06,467 --> 00:23:08,666
(But, Tang Bing is a client worth billions.)

298
00:23:08,822 --> 00:23:10,242
(We can't not give him a face.)

299
00:23:10,982 --> 00:23:12,542
(The bigger picture is more important.)

300
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,370
Mr. Tang.

301
00:23:17,111 --> 00:23:18,319
I won't drink.

302
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,700
She can't drink either.

303
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,110
If you don't eat, she won't eat.

304
00:23:24,245 --> 00:23:25,965
If you don't sleep, she won't sleep, right?

305
00:23:28,446 --> 00:23:29,717
Just a little joke.

306
00:23:29,829 --> 00:23:31,353
This doesn't make sense.

307
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,362
Besides, Lawyer Cheng is an adult.

308
00:23:34,493 --> 00:23:37,439
You can't interfere with what she wants, right?

309
00:23:37,535 --> 00:23:38,835
Lawyer Cheng.

310
00:23:39,657 --> 00:23:41,536
If you can't handle alcohol, how can you work properly?

311
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,229
Serving our clients is our most basic duty.

312
00:23:47,477 --> 00:23:49,286
Mr. Tang, I am willing to...

313
00:23:49,367 --> 00:23:50,816
You can't do it even if you're willing.

314
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,002
My assistant lawyer is not allowed to drink.

315
00:23:56,994 --> 00:23:58,294
Lawyer Qian,

316
00:23:58,909 --> 00:24:00,419
you're being a bit

317
00:24:00,777 --> 00:24:02,162
too stubborn.

318
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:03,966
Mr. Tang.

319
00:24:05,018 --> 00:24:06,489
This is my work principle.

320
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,922
No one can make an exception.

321
00:24:16,183 --> 00:24:18,533
Okay, we won't drink.

322
00:24:19,694 --> 00:24:21,162
Let's not drink.

323
00:24:21,719 --> 00:24:22,921
Your aura is so strong.

324
00:24:23,002 --> 00:24:24,871
I don't know who between us is the boss.

325
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:27,722
What are you waiting here for?

326
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:29,816
Aren't you embarrassed by this situation?

327
00:24:30,089 --> 00:24:32,370
Let's replace the Wuchang red wine with Wuchang rice.

328
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:33,819
Let's just have a meal.

329
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,800
Boss.

330
00:24:45,934 --> 00:24:47,484
Thank you just now.

331
00:24:47,648 --> 00:24:48,762
Cheng Yao.

332
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,840
Don't bring your old habits and ulterior motives to Junheng & Co.

333
00:24:52,229 --> 00:24:53,529
What do you mean?

334
00:24:53,805 --> 00:24:56,000
Junheng's business relies on professionalism, not drinking parties.

335
00:24:56,024 --> 00:24:57,962
There's no need for you to accompany clients.

336
00:24:58,389 --> 00:25:01,282
- I was just trying to help you. - I don't need it.

337
00:25:01,461 --> 00:25:02,936
I don't need you to act like a fake good person.

338
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,429
This is an insult to my reputation.

339
00:25:05,684 --> 00:25:08,524
If I catch you with such intentions again, you'll be fired immediately.

340
00:25:09,073 --> 00:25:11,675
Also, I warn you. Don't go meet Tang Bing alone.

341
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,251
You speak so rudely.

342
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,522
I really don't understand Qian Heng.

343
00:25:19,883 --> 00:25:22,642
The client invited me for drinks. How could I refuse?

344
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,198
(You went drinking with the client?)

345
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,714
No, the client wanted to drink.

346
00:25:26,795 --> 00:25:28,115
But, Qian Heng wouldn't allow it.

347
00:25:28,201 --> 00:25:30,110
The situation was a bit unpleasant just now.

348
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:33,009
And also, I just got scolded by him.

349
00:25:34,035 --> 00:25:36,066
(Isn't he helping you?)

350
00:25:37,424 --> 00:25:39,328
I know he wants to help me.

351
00:25:39,409 --> 00:25:41,082
He meant well by telling me these things.

352
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:43,082
Every time he speaks, it's so hurtful.

353
00:25:43,171 --> 00:25:44,962
Doesn't he know?

354
00:25:47,227 --> 00:25:49,159
Wait. What about your client?

355
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,214
He wouldn't really have any bad thoughts about you, right?

356
00:25:51,238 --> 00:25:53,417
Be careful. Don't let him take advantage of you.

357
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,274
It does feel a little weird.

358
00:25:56,485 --> 00:25:59,120
But, don't worry. I'm not easy to bully.

359
00:26:00,633 --> 00:26:01,769
Anyway, as long as I listen to the boss

360
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:03,633
and don't meet the client alone, I'll be fine.

361
00:26:07,046 --> 00:26:09,066
Why are you playing games alone?

362
00:26:09,373 --> 00:26:11,512
- Where's Hao Zi? - (Don't mention him to me.)

363
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:14,259
What happened? Did you guys fight again?

364
00:26:17,259 --> 00:26:18,790
He's been so busy lately.

365
00:26:18,924 --> 00:26:20,753
He doesn't come home for days.

366
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,460
(It's driving me mad.)

367
00:26:24,024 --> 00:26:26,395
Ting Ting, you two are about to become parents.

368
00:26:26,476 --> 00:26:28,470
Isn't it normal for Hao Zi to feel more stressed?

369
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,096
Can't you understand him a little more?

370
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,360
(Stop defending him.)

371
00:26:31,429 --> 00:26:33,482
(Am I not suffering during this pregnancy?)

372
00:26:33,585 --> 00:26:34,644
I'm giving birth to his child.

373
00:26:34,668 --> 00:26:36,773
He is supposed to treat me well and take care of me.

374
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,336
A child is not something someone gives birth for someone else.

375
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,200
Ting Ting, relationships and families need continuous care, don't they?

376
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,860
You sound like you understand it very well.

377
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:51,368
(Lawyer Cheng, can you come to the hotel conference room?)

378
00:26:51,392 --> 00:26:53,524
(There are some materials that need your help to review)

379
00:26:53,548 --> 00:26:55,311
(so as not to delay the efficiency of the two bosses.)

380
00:26:55,335 --> 00:26:57,155
I won't chat with you for now. I have to work.

381
00:26:57,179 --> 00:26:59,042
- Goodbye. - (Goodbye.)

382
00:27:08,232 --> 00:27:10,776
(Mr. Tang's assistant called me to go to the hotel conference room)

383
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,320
(to help him organize some materials.)

384
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,569
(Also, I warn you not to meet Tang Bing alone.)

385
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:19,176
I'm meeting with his assistant, not Mr. Tang himself.

386
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,500
It should be fine.

387
00:27:24,761 --> 00:27:27,242
Forget it. I'm just a subordinate.

388
00:27:27,495 --> 00:27:29,162
I can't bother the boss with everything.

389
00:27:34,907 --> 00:27:36,079
(Is Mr. Tang coming over?)

390
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,070
(Do I need to inform Lawyer Qian?)

391
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,559
(No need. Mr. Tang still has to meet a client.)

392
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,940
(He'll be a little late.)

393
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:51,962
Miss Cheng, please come this way.

394
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,940
Lawyer Cheng is here.

395
00:27:56,202 --> 00:27:57,831
Isn't Mr. Tang in a meeting?

396
00:27:59,031 --> 00:28:01,060
Just a regular client, not important.

397
00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:05,430
In that case,

398
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,256
I'll invite Lawyer Qian to join our meeting.

399
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,562
Wait. No. Lawyer Cheng.

400
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,309
Lawyer Cheng, let me explain.

401
00:28:12,389 --> 00:28:13,510
Come here.

402
00:28:13,644 --> 00:28:14,683
This is what happened.

403
00:28:14,876 --> 00:28:16,876
I'm just temporarily returning to China this time.

404
00:28:17,009 --> 00:28:19,375
Lawyer Qian asked me to prepare a lot of materials. Take a look.

405
00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:20,962
They're all on my computer.

406
00:28:21,071 --> 00:28:23,508
I just had the receptionist print them out and send them over.

407
00:28:23,532 --> 00:28:24,776
If I ask Zhang to organize them,

408
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,081
I'm afraid he'll be clumsy and not organize them clearly.

409
00:28:27,149 --> 00:28:28,802
I thought you could come and help.

410
00:28:29,017 --> 00:28:30,959
Lawyer Qian's time is so precious.

411
00:28:31,087 --> 00:28:32,607
I don't want to disturb him with this.

412
00:28:33,001 --> 00:28:34,511
It's just a small matter.

413
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,120
Lawyer Cheng, you should have no problem, right?

414
00:28:41,349 --> 00:28:42,514
Of course.

415
00:28:42,795 --> 00:28:45,416
This is what I should do. Let's get started.

416
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,134
Zhang, I suddenly remembered

417
00:28:49,215 --> 00:28:51,775
that there are some new documents printed out at the front desk.

418
00:28:51,846 --> 00:28:53,197
Can you go get them for me?

419
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,930
Remember. Go and come back quickly.

420
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:57,467
No problem, Mr. Tang.

421
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:15,786
Lawyer Cheng.

422
00:29:16,163 --> 00:29:17,962
I have one more thing to trouble you with.

423
00:29:18,203 --> 00:29:21,907
Can you help me connect this power source?

424
00:29:22,032 --> 00:29:24,882
I might need that projector for some materials later.

425
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,629
I've been working hard for so many years,

426
00:29:26,653 --> 00:29:29,172
and now I've hurt my back.

427
00:29:29,292 --> 00:29:30,599
I can't bend down properly.

428
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,980
Can you please help me,

429
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,791
Lawyer Cheng?

430
00:29:37,287 --> 00:29:38,587
Lawyer Cheng.

431
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,722
Can you please lend a hand?

432
00:29:45,836 --> 00:29:47,775
Please continue working. I'll take a break.

433
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,362
Yes. You need to open it.

434
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:56,094
It's inside.

435
00:30:02,763 --> 00:30:04,095
Lawyer Cheng,

436
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:06,590
you must be tired

437
00:30:06,883 --> 00:30:08,183
working with Lawyer Qian.

438
00:30:08,529 --> 00:30:09,672
Not really.

439
00:30:09,926 --> 00:30:11,916
Following him can help me learn a lot.

440
00:30:12,287 --> 00:30:13,602
That's good.

441
00:30:13,734 --> 00:30:14,922
Mr. Tang.

442
00:30:15,468 --> 00:30:17,218
Lawyer Cheng, don't be nervous.

443
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:18,759
I just wanted to say this.

444
00:30:18,863 --> 00:30:21,254
I have also been trained by others.

445
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,642
Things change over time.

446
00:30:23,971 --> 00:30:25,962
After so many years, I have finally succeeded.

447
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:30,082
But, my heart is tired and cold.

448
00:30:31,049 --> 00:30:34,002
I feel like a little boy with a serious illness.

449
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:38,722
I long for and need a ray of light to warm me and heal me.

450
00:30:38,884 --> 00:30:41,785
For this ray of light, I have been searching for many years.

451
00:30:41,888 --> 00:30:43,188
And now,

452
00:30:43,754 --> 00:30:45,162
I feel like I have found it.

453
00:30:45,341 --> 00:30:46,732
You are that ray of light,

454
00:30:47,436 --> 00:30:48,677
my Miss Right.

455
00:30:48,836 --> 00:30:50,322
Lawyer Cheng.

456
00:30:50,467 --> 00:30:53,402
Shine your light on my heart without restraint.

457
00:30:53,511 --> 00:30:55,930
- Save this little boy. - Get away.

458
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:01,807
Let me tell you.

459
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,559
You're already harassing me.

460
00:31:03,686 --> 00:31:04,986
This is illegal.

461
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,370
You hit me.

462
00:31:10,389 --> 00:31:11,689
Exciting.

463
00:31:12,459 --> 00:31:14,249
I haven't experienced

464
00:31:14,546 --> 00:31:16,386
the feeling of being rejected for a long time.

465
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,580
Come on.

466
00:31:20,404 --> 00:31:22,473
Yao Yao, what about this?

467
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:24,842
Let's play a little game to liven things up.

468
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:26,283
From now on,

469
00:31:26,409 --> 00:31:28,082
every time you slap me,

470
00:31:28,364 --> 00:31:29,684
I'll give you a hundred thousand.

471
00:31:29,719 --> 00:31:31,229
After that, we'll settle together.

472
00:31:31,346 --> 00:31:32,682
Do your best,

473
00:31:32,903 --> 00:31:34,842
or else I'll use your incompetence

474
00:31:35,004 --> 00:31:37,042
as a reason to reject working with Lawyer Qian.

475
00:31:37,731 --> 00:31:38,852
Yao Yao.

476
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,207
Let's start the game.

477
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,620
Go away!

478
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:48,922
Wow, a new program, Little Pepper.

479
00:31:50,389 --> 00:31:51,780
I'm not afraid to tell you,

480
00:31:52,226 --> 00:31:55,722
your kick completely ignited me.

481
00:31:56,342 --> 00:31:58,842
All these years, I have encountered countless challenges.

482
00:31:59,086 --> 00:32:03,442
Every time, I burn myself out to overcome challenges

483
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,631
and stomp on them fiercely.

484
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,130
Now,

485
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:11,264
the surveillance is off

486
00:32:12,709 --> 00:32:14,009
and the door is locked.

487
00:32:14,487 --> 00:32:16,676
No one will disturb us.

488
00:32:17,171 --> 00:32:18,640
Come on, Little Pepper.

489
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,110
Let's burn together.

490
00:32:22,684 --> 00:32:25,750
- Wait. Lawyer Cheng. - Let's take a look at Mr. Tang Bing's true face.

491
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,648
- No. It's a misunderstanding. - He's openly harassing a female lawyer.

492
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,682
Lawyer Cheng, don't...

493
00:32:29,763 --> 00:32:32,323
Give me your phone. The closer you get, the clearer the picture.

494
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,437
- Lawyer Cheng. - No need to block yourself. I've recorded everything.

495
00:32:35,461 --> 00:32:37,722
Wait. It's a misunderstanding. Lawyer Cheng.

496
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,122
Lawyer Cheng.

497
00:32:52,542 --> 00:32:54,882
Hooligan, I'll expose you.

498
00:33:00,581 --> 00:33:02,722
- Who is it? - It's me.

499
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:19,375
I have some documents here. You need to take a look.

500
00:33:23,189 --> 00:33:25,082
- What's wrong? - I'm fine, boss.

501
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,200
Do you need something printed? Just give it to me.

502
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,162
Say it.

503
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,002
Why are your eyes red?

504
00:33:37,364 --> 00:33:39,659
If you don't tell me, don't bother coming to work after this.

505
00:33:39,683 --> 00:33:40,762
Nothing.

506
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:46,042
Didn't I say that if you want to cry, you need my approval?

507
00:33:46,311 --> 00:33:48,542
If you cry behind my back and don't tell me the truth,

508
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,520
I'll deduct all of your year-end bonus.

509
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:57,531
Has Tang Bing harassed you?

510
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:00,202
(I feel like a little boy with a serious illness.)

511
00:34:00,278 --> 00:34:02,019
- Boss, don't watch. It's disgusting. - Stand there.

512
00:34:02,043 --> 00:34:04,642
(I need a ray of light to warm me...)

513
00:34:04,802 --> 00:34:05,853
Stand there!

514
00:34:05,934 --> 00:34:08,552
(For this ray of light, I have been searching for many years.)

515
00:34:08,684 --> 00:34:12,282
- Turn around. - (I feel like I have found it.)

516
00:34:12,436 --> 00:34:13,922
(You are that ray of light, )

517
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:15,670
(my Miss Right.)

518
00:34:15,998 --> 00:34:17,348
(Lawyer Cheng.)

519
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:20,443
(Shine your light on my heart without restraint.)

520
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,910
(Now, the surveillance is off)

521
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:28,522
(and the door is locked.)

522
00:34:28,732 --> 00:34:30,841
(No one will disturb us.)

523
00:34:34,073 --> 00:34:35,602
(Come on, Little Pepper.)

524
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,627
(Let's burn together.)

525
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,870
Boss, stop watching. I won't post it then.

526
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:46,263
I know Tang Bing is worth billions as a client.

527
00:34:46,344 --> 00:34:49,279
I won't make things difficult for you. I just wanted to vent my anger.

528
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,869
I wasn't really prepared to post it.

529
00:34:52,858 --> 00:34:53,858
Actually,

530
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,202
I've suffered no substantial loss.

531
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:58,122
I just wanted to vent.

532
00:34:58,744 --> 00:35:02,522
Boss, whatever decision you make, I can understand you.

533
00:35:03,308 --> 00:35:06,242
If you want to downplay this matter, I also support you.

534
00:35:06,575 --> 00:35:11,060
This may be the most rational and best solution to solve this issue.

535
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,210
Do you really think so?

536
00:35:20,989 --> 00:35:24,002
Okay. Then, let's go find Mr. Tang and make up for it.

537
00:36:06,209 --> 00:36:07,322
Mr. Tang.

538
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,282
Mr. Qian. Why are you in such a hurry to see me?

539
00:36:12,399 --> 00:36:14,079
Is there any new progress in the case?

540
00:36:14,183 --> 00:36:15,642
Thank you for your hard work.

541
00:36:19,709 --> 00:36:20,789
Lawyer Qian.

542
00:36:20,974 --> 00:36:23,070
What do you mean?

543
00:36:23,251 --> 00:36:25,800
The surveillance is off and the door is locked.

544
00:36:26,255 --> 00:36:28,270
- Now, no one will disturb us. - Yeah.

545
00:36:28,351 --> 00:36:30,295
Wait. Why does this sound so familiar?

546
00:36:30,376 --> 00:36:31,676
It's good if it's familiar.

547
00:36:32,035 --> 00:36:34,802
I heard that you're a little boy who got seriously ill.

548
00:36:34,918 --> 00:36:36,682
Let me treat you now.

549
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,002
Boss.

550
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,522
Qian Heng, how dare you hit me?

551
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:44,162
I'll fight you.

552
00:36:45,022 --> 00:36:47,242
Ouch!

553
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,882
Which hand did he touch you with?

554
00:36:49,276 --> 00:36:50,402
Right hand.

555
00:36:51,933 --> 00:36:54,123
Qian Heng, it's dislocated.

556
00:36:56,308 --> 00:36:57,739
Qian Heng, what are you trying to do?

557
00:36:57,763 --> 00:36:59,252
I believe that, with your character,

558
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:01,483
not only did you touch her, but also looked at her inappropriately.

559
00:37:01,507 --> 00:37:03,682
I only took a quick glance.

560
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,002
Qian Heng, let me explain.

561
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:10,869
This is just my bad habit. I just teased Lawyer Cheng a little.

562
00:37:11,011 --> 00:37:13,311
- Thanks for the reminder. - Wait, no!

563
00:37:13,966 --> 00:37:15,801
I can see that you have a lot of tricks up your sleeve.

564
00:37:15,825 --> 00:37:16,899
You must have put in a lot of effort.

565
00:37:16,923 --> 00:37:19,362
Of course, Lawyer Cheng is not easy to tease.

566
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:21,762
I definitely have to put in some effort.

567
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,532
No. Lawyer Qian, listen to me.

568
00:37:29,355 --> 00:37:30,655
Lawyer Qian.

569
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,602
You're too domineering.

570
00:37:32,882 --> 00:37:34,672
Can't I have some thoughts?

571
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:38,110
You are not allowed to have any thoughts about her.

572
00:37:38,247 --> 00:37:39,547
What do you mean...

573
00:37:44,469 --> 00:37:45,562
Boss.

574
00:37:46,341 --> 00:37:47,877
Calm down. Otherwise,

575
00:37:47,958 --> 00:37:49,694
he might accuse us of intentionally hurting him.

576
00:37:49,718 --> 00:37:50,856
It will be difficult to handle.

577
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,190
Qian Heng,

578
00:37:52,317 --> 00:37:53,940
you are being unreasonable.

579
00:37:54,176 --> 00:37:55,576
Where is my phone?

580
00:37:55,757 --> 00:37:57,107
I'm going to call the police.

581
00:37:57,481 --> 00:37:58,575
I will make sure you go to jail

582
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:00,042
and have your license revoked.

583
00:38:00,231 --> 00:38:01,418
My actions have at most violated

584
00:38:01,442 --> 00:38:03,012
the Public Security Administration Punishment Law

585
00:38:03,036 --> 00:38:05,418
by physically assaulting or intentionally harming another person.

586
00:38:05,442 --> 00:38:07,517
I may face detention of more than 5 days but less than 10 days,

587
00:38:07,541 --> 00:38:09,922
and a fine of more than 200 yuan but less than 500 yuan.

588
00:38:10,278 --> 00:38:11,722
For less serious injuries,

589
00:38:11,803 --> 00:38:14,922
I may face detention of less than 5 days or a fine less than 500 yuan.

590
00:38:15,909 --> 00:38:17,562
The beating I just gave you?

591
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,242
I can earn it back in three minutes,

592
00:38:19,382 --> 00:38:21,642
and it won't affect my lawyer's license.

593
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:26,360
Cheng Yao.

594
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,927
I have never done anything that cannot be resolved in my life.

595
00:38:28,951 --> 00:38:30,559
Can you please study the law properly?

596
00:38:33,583 --> 00:38:34,663
Mr. Tang.

597
00:38:34,744 --> 00:38:35,825
How is my medical skill?

598
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,640
- Do you want me to give you another treatment? - No, Doctor Qian.

599
00:38:38,726 --> 00:38:40,265
Sorry. It's Lawyer Qian.

600
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,162
I have already fully recovered.

601
00:38:43,382 --> 00:38:46,731
Lawyer Qian, I don't know that she's your girlfriend.

602
00:38:47,138 --> 00:38:49,378
Otherwise, I wouldn't dare to have any crooked thoughts.

603
00:38:49,456 --> 00:38:51,725
It's just a misunderstanding.

604
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,130
Brother.

605
00:38:53,638 --> 00:38:54,762
Cheng Yao.

606
00:38:54,904 --> 00:38:56,694
Go get a piece of A4 paper and a pen.

607
00:39:07,399 --> 00:39:08,442
Sign it.

608
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:10,119
Sign what?

609
00:39:10,317 --> 00:39:11,790
I won't do your business anymore.

610
00:39:11,925 --> 00:39:14,035
Sign the termination of the agency agreement.

611
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,202
Okay.

612
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:27,610
Signed.

613
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:38,463
Done. Write a contract for the termination of the agency representation.

614
00:39:38,487 --> 00:39:39,787
Then, archive the file.

615
00:39:41,154 --> 00:39:42,195
Wait.

616
00:39:42,285 --> 00:39:43,882
I have a video of you in my hands.

617
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:46,042
If you dare to make any moves against Lawyer Qian,

618
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:47,429
I will post your video online.

619
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,878
I'll make you a social outcast first, and then let the law punish you.

620
00:39:49,902 --> 00:39:52,103
Let me educate you that your actions are crossing

621
00:39:52,184 --> 00:39:54,722
the boundaries of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China.

622
00:39:54,746 --> 00:39:56,551
Violating the law can land you in jail.

623
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:59,371
I'll keep an eye on you from now on. See if you dare to violate others.

624
00:39:59,395 --> 00:40:00,461
Wait. Do what you want.

625
00:40:00,542 --> 00:40:03,005
At least give me those videos.

626
00:40:03,487 --> 00:40:05,717
If you want to retaliate, come at me.

627
00:40:06,754 --> 00:40:08,096
No one has been able to defeat me in court.

628
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,282
Of course not.

629
00:41:35,859 --> 00:41:37,159
Thank you, boss.

630
00:41:43,474 --> 00:41:45,042
Don't you have anything to say?

631
00:41:48,528 --> 00:41:49,962
Boss, you were amazing just now.

632
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,402
I used to think you were just good at talking.

633
00:41:52,613 --> 00:41:54,416
I didn't realize you were also skilled in martial arts.

634
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,639
Just this?

635
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,191
I'm sorry, boss.

636
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,409
I'm causing trouble for you and the law firm again.

637
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:05,461
Cheng Yao, let me ask you. If I hadn't found out about this,

638
00:42:05,485 --> 00:42:07,282
were you not planning on telling me at all?

639
00:42:07,551 --> 00:42:09,423
No, boss. I don't want to make things difficult for you.

640
00:42:09,447 --> 00:42:11,327
You don't want to make things difficult for me?

641
00:42:12,043 --> 00:42:13,526
You get bullied, and I should turn a blind eye?

642
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:15,482
What do you take me for? A pimp?

643
00:42:15,671 --> 00:42:16,722
No.

644
00:42:18,866 --> 00:42:21,872
My ex-supervising lawyer always made us go out

645
00:42:21,953 --> 00:42:23,233
to accompany clients for drinks.

646
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:24,750
He said it's normal to do so.

647
00:42:24,831 --> 00:42:25,871
So, I thought...

648
00:42:25,952 --> 00:42:28,665
Cheng Yao, no matter where you learned these rules from before,

649
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:30,043
it won't work with me.

650
00:42:30,128 --> 00:42:31,930
With me, you never have to tolerate anything.

651
00:42:32,011 --> 00:42:33,784
If someone harasses you again, just slap him.

652
00:42:33,808 --> 00:42:36,083
His net worth, whether hundreds of millions or billions, doesn't matter.

653
00:42:36,107 --> 00:42:39,002
- But what if I can't beat him? - Tell me, and I'll help you fight.

654
00:42:45,597 --> 00:42:47,322
Hone your professional skills

655
00:42:47,415 --> 00:42:49,616
so you never have to comply with the client's unreasonable demands.

656
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,031
This market is huge,

657
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,940
and you can always find the right client for yourself.

658
00:42:54,376 --> 00:42:56,282
Remember. It's we who choose the clients,

659
00:42:56,354 --> 00:42:57,744
not the other way around.

660
00:42:58,964 --> 00:43:00,922
Also, don't always think about the big picture.

661
00:43:01,142 --> 00:43:02,242
I know,

662
00:43:02,537 --> 00:43:04,337
you don't tell me because you don't trust me.

663
00:43:04,547 --> 00:43:06,667
You think that, just like your ex-supervising lawyer,

664
00:43:06,782 --> 00:43:09,102
I'd choose money over my subordinates' self-esteem, right?

665
00:43:09,258 --> 00:43:10,808
No, boss.

666
00:43:11,097 --> 00:43:12,847
I really didn't want to bother you.

667
00:43:14,185 --> 00:43:16,042
Do you know how dangerous your actions are?

668
00:43:16,946 --> 00:43:18,145
He's a man.

669
00:43:18,286 --> 00:43:20,426
If he takes it a step further, can you handle it?

670
00:43:21,235 --> 00:43:24,159
If he snatches your phone and deletes the video, can you handle it?

671
00:43:24,399 --> 00:43:26,409
If he turns around and threatens you with a scandalous video,

672
00:43:26,433 --> 00:43:27,733
can you handle it?
