1
00:01:35,526 --> 00:01:38,842
(My Boss)

2
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:42,146
(Episode 25)

3
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,520
(Your girlfriend tied your necktie for you, huh?)

4
00:01:44,715 --> 00:01:46,675
(So what? My girlfriend did the same for me too.)

5
00:02:13,736 --> 00:02:14,819
(Have you come back?)

6
00:02:14,954 --> 00:02:16,802
(Let's have lunch near the firm.)

7
00:02:21,761 --> 00:02:22,921
(I'm still busy.)

8
00:02:23,002 --> 00:02:24,222
(Eat without me.)

9
00:02:32,146 --> 00:02:33,226
(Bao Rui, )

10
00:02:33,337 --> 00:02:35,967
(did any of your colleagues seek your help today?)

11
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,722
(Boss, are you trying to improve my performance rating?)

12
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,375
(Does yesterday's work count?)

13
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:49,602
(I delivered some materials to Yu Fei yesterday.)

14
00:03:11,606 --> 00:03:13,762
(Mental stress and high level of anxiety)

15
00:03:13,864 --> 00:03:16,681
(are signs of sub-optimal health.)

16
00:03:16,844 --> 00:03:18,606
(Being in that state for a long period of time)

17
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,762
(brings no benefit to both parties.)

18
00:03:21,028 --> 00:03:23,482
(One may use incense to soothe their nerves)

19
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,842
(or listen to Zen music to shift their attention.)

20
00:03:27,154 --> 00:03:29,966
(At the same time, it produces a desireless image.)

21
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,290
(It can help reduce the mental stress of)

22
00:03:32,371 --> 00:03:34,571
(being worried about the exposure of the relationship.)

23
00:03:37,488 --> 00:03:39,402
What the heck is this?

24
00:03:39,655 --> 00:03:40,925
This must be a scam.

25
00:03:45,385 --> 00:03:47,216
So, what exactly happened?

26
00:03:47,947 --> 00:03:49,167
I...

27
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:52,560
Min and I had a great relationship.

28
00:03:53,753 --> 00:03:55,242
We knew each other at the workplace.

29
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,954
We got married after dating each other for three years.

30
00:03:58,978 --> 00:04:01,128
He has a great temper. He's nice to me too.

31
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,962
It all fell apart because of that class reunion.

32
00:04:06,568 --> 00:04:08,238
On that class reunion,

33
00:04:09,025 --> 00:04:10,482
I met Lu Jian.

34
00:04:11,354 --> 00:04:12,574
Be careful.

35
00:04:14,002 --> 00:04:15,962
Back then, I just got married not long ago.

36
00:04:16,593 --> 00:04:19,301
Everyone was congratulating me on it.

37
00:04:19,382 --> 00:04:21,969
- They offered me toast after toast. - Do you know?

38
00:04:22,317 --> 00:04:23,747
I drank a lot.

39
00:04:23,882 --> 00:04:25,362
In the end, I got drunk.

40
00:04:25,505 --> 00:04:27,605
I liked you ever since we were in high school.

41
00:04:28,763 --> 00:04:29,983
Look at you.

42
00:04:30,096 --> 00:04:32,602
You're just as beautiful even though it's been so long.

43
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,387
Back then, I couldn't think clearly.

44
00:04:35,553 --> 00:04:37,242
I don't know what's wrong with me.

45
00:04:38,193 --> 00:04:39,424
I...

46
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:45,005
Min and I always wanted a child.

47
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:47,057
But I couldn't get pregnant.

48
00:04:47,922 --> 00:04:50,232
But one month after the class reunion,

49
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,042
I found out that I was pregnant.

50
00:04:58,616 --> 00:05:01,486
How did your ex-husband know that the child wasn't his?

51
00:05:01,986 --> 00:05:03,642
After the child was born,

52
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,422
he did a checkup in the hospital.

53
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,812
He found out that the child had a different blood type from him.

54
00:05:08,836 --> 00:05:10,642
He did a DNA test.

55
00:05:11,324 --> 00:05:13,544
After that, he never returned home.

56
00:05:14,168 --> 00:05:16,877
I received the divorce agreement not long after that.

57
00:05:17,892 --> 00:05:19,522
I felt guilty to him.

58
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:21,630
I agreed with the divorce.

59
00:05:22,784 --> 00:05:24,895
My parents severed their ties with me out of spite

60
00:05:25,562 --> 00:05:27,122
when they found out.

61
00:05:29,721 --> 00:05:32,471
But my child was diagnosed with congenital heart disease.

62
00:05:33,694 --> 00:05:36,482
The fees for his surgeries and treatments,

63
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:38,537
I can't afford them at all.

64
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:41,388
I...

65
00:05:41,927 --> 00:05:43,567
If so, have you contacted Lu Jian before?

66
00:05:44,473 --> 00:05:46,493
- I have. - What did he think about it?

67
00:05:48,096 --> 00:05:49,922
He blocked me on WeChat.

68
00:05:50,515 --> 00:05:52,082
His family is pretty well-off.

69
00:05:52,153 --> 00:05:53,642
I can only depend on him.

70
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:55,481
I called him, but he didn't pick up.

71
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:56,993
I couldn't reach him at all.

72
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:01,070
I have no choice but to file a lawsuit.

73
00:06:02,857 --> 00:06:05,017
If not, I can only end my life together with my child.

74
00:06:05,793 --> 00:06:07,022
Please calm down.

75
00:06:07,721 --> 00:06:08,941
You see,

76
00:06:09,676 --> 00:06:12,402
a lawsuit requires time and energy.

77
00:06:13,033 --> 00:06:15,502
The procedures themselves might take up to one year.

78
00:06:16,177 --> 00:06:17,857
Your child can't afford to wait that long.

79
00:06:19,926 --> 00:06:22,676
Under such circumstances, negotiating a deal is your only way out.

80
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:26,007
Can you please give me Lu Jian's contact number?

81
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,242
Okay.

82
00:06:28,499 --> 00:06:29,827
But will this work?

83
00:06:30,063 --> 00:06:31,383
We'll know once we give it a try.

84
00:06:50,388 --> 00:06:53,188
Bao, did you hear any strange noise?

85
00:06:53,351 --> 00:06:54,528
I pulled an all-nighter last night.

86
00:06:54,552 --> 00:06:56,522
When I hear rhythmic sounds like these,

87
00:06:56,754 --> 00:06:57,974
it makes me sleepy.

88
00:07:02,536 --> 00:07:04,207
Did you smell incense?

89
00:07:06,745 --> 00:07:09,801
Say, did someone get triggered after losing a lawsuit?

90
00:07:10,906 --> 00:07:12,126
No.

91
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,040
I think our boss is ascending to deityhood.

92
00:07:17,155 --> 00:07:19,520
What happened to him? Shouldn't we show him some concern?

93
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:21,809
No. Maybe this is his new hobby.

94
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,177
As if. I think he's trying to be a monk.

95
00:07:25,384 --> 00:07:26,682
He's trying to be a monk?

96
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:29,722
If that's the case, do I have to take over this firm?

97
00:07:30,091 --> 00:07:31,482
But I'm not ready yet.

98
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,042
Boss, are you okay?

99
00:07:41,577 --> 00:07:43,508
Yeah. Do you guys need anything?

100
00:07:43,593 --> 00:07:45,068
- Nope. - Nope.

101
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:47,322
Good. Come and join me.

102
00:07:48,585 --> 00:07:50,162
He wants me to join him...

103
00:07:50,714 --> 00:07:51,793
Listen,

104
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:54,057
if you feel anxious or worried

105
00:07:54,609 --> 00:07:56,388
in the office,

106
00:07:56,499 --> 00:07:58,959
you should try to focus your attention.

107
00:07:59,929 --> 00:08:02,413
When you're anxious and flustered,

108
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:04,042
those are signs of...

109
00:08:07,857 --> 00:08:09,077
That's him.

110
00:08:12,947 --> 00:08:13,987
Lawyer Cheng,

111
00:08:14,124 --> 00:08:16,647
you didn't say that she was here when you called me.

112
00:08:17,487 --> 00:08:19,036
I'm going to get married soon.

113
00:08:19,117 --> 00:08:21,482
I don't want my fiancée to know that I'm meeting her again.

114
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:24,393
And you, Lin Feng Juan,

115
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:26,030
how many times have I told you

116
00:08:26,369 --> 00:08:28,602
not to pester me?

117
00:08:29,768 --> 00:08:31,608
I'll call the cops on you if you keep this up.

118
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,980
Mr. Lu,

119
00:08:35,218 --> 00:08:37,418
if you don't cooperate with us,

120
00:08:37,508 --> 00:08:39,084
I have the right to send a lawyer letter

121
00:08:39,108 --> 00:08:41,903
to the HR and Legal Department of your company on my client's behalf.

122
00:08:42,249 --> 00:08:43,657
By then, you'll know

123
00:08:43,843 --> 00:08:45,043
if it's intentional harassment

124
00:08:45,162 --> 00:08:46,431
or legitimate right protection.

125
00:08:52,593 --> 00:08:53,614
Fine.

126
00:08:53,695 --> 00:08:56,058
Let me make this clear. I only have ten minutes.

127
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,741
Lu Jian, what do you mean by this?

128
00:09:01,482 --> 00:09:04,350
Han is your child. Now, he's in the hospital.

129
00:09:04,431 --> 00:09:06,301
Is he only worth ten minutes of your time?

130
00:09:06,763 --> 00:09:08,242
Let's make things clear.

131
00:09:08,702 --> 00:09:11,362
Who can prove that he's my child?

132
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,977
If he's not my ex-husband's child, he must be your child!

133
00:09:14,001 --> 00:09:15,601
The timing is too much of a coincidence.

134
00:09:15,867 --> 00:09:17,242
Are you out of your mind?

135
00:09:17,452 --> 00:09:19,467
Yes, I did sleep with you.

136
00:09:19,632 --> 00:09:21,232
But who knows what other men you've slept with?

137
00:09:21,256 --> 00:09:22,476
Am I right?

138
00:09:25,388 --> 00:09:26,608
I know now.

139
00:09:27,504 --> 00:09:28,724
Lawyer Cheng,

140
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,242
she's trying to scam me

141
00:09:30,353 --> 00:09:31,744
because my family is wealthy.

142
00:09:32,351 --> 00:09:34,227
You have to uphold justice for me.

143
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:35,527
Fine.

144
00:09:35,815 --> 00:09:37,965
Since you think I'm a scammer,

145
00:09:38,282 --> 00:09:40,992
let's go to the hospital and do a DNA test.

146
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:44,362
If the child isn't yours, I'll apologize to you immediately.

147
00:09:44,507 --> 00:09:45,642
Do you dare to do so?

148
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,070
I don't.

149
00:09:49,933 --> 00:09:51,153
Lawyer Cheng,

150
00:09:51,234 --> 00:09:52,452
even if the court is at play here,

151
00:09:52,476 --> 00:09:54,682
they can't force me to do a DNA test, right?

152
00:09:56,249 --> 00:09:58,507
Besides, if I did the test,

153
00:09:58,687 --> 00:10:00,268
even if the child wasn't mine,

154
00:10:00,437 --> 00:10:01,848
the child would become mine

155
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:03,433
if you spread gossip to the outside world.

156
00:10:03,457 --> 00:10:04,882
Of course I dare not do it.

157
00:10:06,497 --> 00:10:07,717
What about this?

158
00:10:08,873 --> 00:10:10,322
You can have this

159
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,136
as compensation.

160
00:10:12,592 --> 00:10:14,382
From now on, we're even.

161
00:10:20,194 --> 00:10:22,234
You better take it when I'm giving you an out here.

162
00:10:33,655 --> 00:10:35,046
Don't feel embarrassed.

163
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:37,761
You can use this money to save your son's life.

164
00:10:42,628 --> 00:10:44,857
Don't be scared. You're not alone.

165
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,459
Lawyer Cheng,

166
00:10:58,345 --> 00:11:00,055
was he speaking the truth?

167
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,391
Even the court can't request him to do a DNA test?

168
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:09,337
At least he admitted that he slept with you.

169
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:12,518
That means it's likely that Han is his child.

170
00:11:12,867 --> 00:11:14,627
If he doesn't do a DNA test,

171
00:11:14,747 --> 00:11:17,046
he has the bear the consequences of failure to provide evidence.

172
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,467
And, if we can obtain other evidence,

173
00:11:19,656 --> 00:11:21,642
we can form a strong evidence chain.

174
00:11:22,046 --> 00:11:24,086
By then, even if he's not willing to do a DNA test,

175
00:11:24,249 --> 00:11:26,958
the court can infer the relationship.

176
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:30,399
Lawyer Cheng,

177
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:33,460
thank you.

178
00:11:33,743 --> 00:11:34,963
I'm just doing my job.

179
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,167
By the way,

180
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:42,106
Junheng & Co provides allowances to public welfare cases.

181
00:11:42,312 --> 00:11:44,162
Your child is young. He needs milk.

182
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:48,137
You have to take care of yourself to protect him better.

183
00:12:00,314 --> 00:12:02,224
Take the money. Take it for your child's sake.

184
00:12:06,007 --> 00:12:07,227
Thank you.

185
00:12:17,307 --> 00:12:18,657
Thank you, Lawyer Cheng.

186
00:12:25,521 --> 00:12:26,865
I had no time to sleep last night.

187
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:28,109
I'm serious.

188
00:12:28,523 --> 00:12:30,563
Do you have something that can help me to sober up?

189
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:31,960
Try and use this on your head.

190
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,142
- Is this effective? - It's super effective.

191
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,642
- Are you sure? - Just try it.

192
00:12:38,616 --> 00:12:40,456
Cheng Yao, where did you go this morning?

193
00:12:40,537 --> 00:12:41,664
You're quite late today.

194
00:12:41,745 --> 00:12:43,335
You even bought a cup of coffee, huh?

195
00:12:43,803 --> 00:12:45,641
I met my client for the public welfare case.

196
00:12:45,752 --> 00:12:47,546
How was it? Is the case difficult to handle?

197
00:12:47,795 --> 00:12:49,506
It's more difficult than I imagine.

198
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:52,377
But I think it's quite challenging. And, I know what to do.

199
00:12:53,152 --> 00:12:55,533
You're this confident when this is your first case, huh?

200
00:12:56,624 --> 00:12:57,865
I have confidence in you too.

201
00:12:57,992 --> 00:13:00,058
I'm nothing compared to you, Bao.

202
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,507
This is why I'm confident in her.

203
00:13:03,719 --> 00:13:04,939
She's very eloquent now.

204
00:13:08,547 --> 00:13:09,767
(Come to my office.)

205
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,492
Boss called for her right after she came back.

206
00:13:21,943 --> 00:13:23,163
Is there an issue with that?

207
00:13:26,648 --> 00:13:28,768
Boss won't tell her to join the monastery too, right?

208
00:13:29,362 --> 00:13:31,643
If so, we'll lose two important members at the same time.

209
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:37,390
What's wrong?

210
00:13:40,388 --> 00:13:41,608
Nothing.

211
00:13:42,241 --> 00:13:43,992
Are you that worried about my capabilities?

212
00:13:44,977 --> 00:13:46,197
That's not it.

213
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm just worried that the progress might be too slow.

214
00:13:49,131 --> 00:13:50,658
After all, I got into a relationship at an old age.

215
00:13:50,682 --> 00:13:52,362
I'm in a hurry to reveal our relationship.

216
00:13:54,217 --> 00:13:55,987
I know you care about me.

217
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:59,162
But every new lawyer has to handle a case independently.

218
00:13:59,498 --> 00:14:01,028
Just treat this as a trial for me.

219
00:14:01,178 --> 00:14:02,538
Just let me do my own thing, okay?

220
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:08,479
The amount isn't high at all. I'm uninterested in those kinds of cases.

221
00:14:11,457 --> 00:14:12,677
What are you laughing at?

222
00:14:14,256 --> 00:14:15,806
I saw you laughing just now.

223
00:14:17,288 --> 00:14:19,928
Forget it. I'm in a great mood today. I won't hold it against you.

224
00:14:20,108 --> 00:14:21,148
By the way,

225
00:14:21,334 --> 00:14:24,148
my family has a gathering tonight. I have to attend it.

226
00:14:24,311 --> 00:14:25,923
I'll head back and get changed before I go there.

227
00:14:25,947 --> 00:14:27,267
I can't keep you company tonight.

228
00:14:27,357 --> 00:14:28,577
Okay.

229
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:32,120
Are you telling me about your schedule?

230
00:14:33,818 --> 00:14:36,938
No. I'm just telling you that you don't need to wait for my call tonight.

231
00:14:40,271 --> 00:14:41,987
- Is there anything else? - No.

232
00:14:42,137 --> 00:14:43,357
If so, I'll head out now.

233
00:14:43,477 --> 00:14:45,466
Do you have anything to tell me?

234
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:46,821
Nope.

235
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:50,322
If so...

236
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,362
(I can't sleep well lately.)

237
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,260
(Do you need me to sing you a lullaby, then?)

238
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,802
Who switched off the air-conditioner? It's hot in here.

239
00:15:33,346 --> 00:15:35,162
(Classic family cases in the last 10 years)

240
00:17:01,506 --> 00:17:02,802
Let me read for a while.

241
00:17:27,127 --> 00:17:29,722
(Can I borrow some books from your book rack?)

242
00:17:36,474 --> 00:17:37,724
(Sure.)

243

(How to be in a relationship at the office)

244
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:16,010
(How to be in a relationship at the office)

245
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,989
Yao Yao, I'm back.

246
00:18:26,311 --> 00:18:27,531
You're back.

247
00:18:28,522 --> 00:18:30,322
Wait a moment. I made something nice for you.

248
00:18:30,391 --> 00:18:31,611
Really?

249
00:18:35,273 --> 00:18:37,104
What have you made? They smell great.

250
00:18:37,954 --> 00:18:39,265
You'll know it later.

251
00:18:39,736 --> 00:18:40,956
Did you drink?

252
00:18:41,178 --> 00:18:42,398
You reek of alcohol.

253
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:45,647
I'll take a bath, then. I do reel of alcohol.

254
00:19:20,707 --> 00:19:21,927
What are you looking for?

255
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,832
Nothing. It's just a book.

256
00:19:26,507 --> 00:19:27,727
Do you need my help?

257
00:19:27,994 --> 00:19:30,114
No need for that. You can resume what you were doing.

258
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:32,802
I baked some cookies. Try them.

259
00:19:33,012 --> 00:19:35,088
All right, leave them there. I'll try them later.

260
00:19:35,249 --> 00:19:37,129
I spent the entire night making them, you know?

261
00:19:37,353 --> 00:19:38,743
What exactly are you looking for?

262
00:19:39,651 --> 00:19:41,200
It's just a book.

263
00:19:43,376 --> 00:19:45,175
What book is that important

264
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:48,231
for you to ignore the cookies I made with all my heart?

265
00:19:50,073 --> 00:19:51,384
That's not it.

266
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,002
Yao Yao, don't be angry.

267
00:19:54,348 --> 00:19:56,882
It's just a compilation of classic cases since ten years ago.

268
00:19:57,215 --> 00:19:58,627
It's nothing important.

269
00:19:58,707 --> 00:20:01,818
I just feel like studying some of the cases as they looked interesting.

270
00:20:02,178 --> 00:20:03,487
Don't be angry, okay?

271
00:20:10,345 --> 00:20:12,842
Cheng Yao, did you hide my book?

272
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,082
You texted me that you wanted to borrow some books. Did you see it?

273
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,362
What book?

274
00:20:19,569 --> 00:20:20,882
Don't you trust me?

275
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,047
What about the basic trust between a couple?

276
00:20:25,385 --> 00:20:29,268
Fine. I'll call Zhu and tell everyone to return to the firm

277
00:20:29,348 --> 00:20:31,002
and find the book for me.

278
00:20:32,256 --> 00:20:34,242
Fine.

279
00:20:35,226 --> 00:20:36,682
I didn't call her.

280
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:41,336
"How to be in a relationship at the office".

281
00:20:41,792 --> 00:20:43,562
I knew it was you.

282
00:20:44,027 --> 00:20:45,818
Tell me what you've learned.

283
00:20:49,423 --> 00:20:51,242
I changed the name for you.

285
00:20:57,108 --> 00:20:58,328
Cheng Yao.

286
00:20:58,947 --> 00:21:00,442
What did you say again?

287
00:21:00,825 --> 00:21:02,722
What about the basic trust between a couple?

288
00:21:02,864 --> 00:21:04,178
Tell me. What kind of punishment do you want?

289
00:21:04,202 --> 00:21:05,422
I know my fault now.

290
00:21:05,778 --> 00:21:08,002
- Stop it! I know my fault now! - Tell me!

291
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:09,202
Stop running!

292
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:32,215
(Are you busy today?)

293
00:21:32,296 --> 00:21:34,496
(Why don't we go to the famous hotpot shop after work?)

294
00:22:06,707 --> 00:22:08,018
Why is she in the suburbs?

295
00:22:10,936 --> 00:22:12,522
(Don't tell me it's Deng Ming again?)

296
00:22:22,243 --> 00:22:23,514
Mr. Wang, it's me.

297
00:22:23,595 --> 00:22:25,378
I have an emergency to attend to. I need to head out.

298
00:22:25,402 --> 00:22:26,882
Come and pick me up.

299
00:22:27,218 --> 00:22:28,657
Yes, right now.

300
00:22:28,753 --> 00:22:30,743
Bring your repair tools with you.

301
00:22:31,261 --> 00:22:32,722
That's right. Okay.

302
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:54,562
(Sorry. The number you have dialed is unavailable.)

303
00:22:54,643 --> 00:22:56,842
(Please try again later. Sorry.)

304
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:03,722
Mr. Wang, drive faster.

305
00:23:27,403 --> 00:23:29,993
Mr. Wang, if I'm not back in an hour,

306
00:23:31,267 --> 00:23:32,882
- call the cops. - Okay, Lawyer Wu.

307
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,259
Be careful out there.

308
00:23:55,947 --> 00:23:57,167
Cheng Xi?

309
00:23:57,628 --> 00:23:58,848
Cheng Xi?

310
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:09,562
Don't come here! Help!

311
00:24:10,516 --> 00:24:12,395
- Cheng Xi! I'm coming! - Don't come here!

312
00:24:12,507 --> 00:24:13,583
- What's wrong? - Help!

313
00:24:13,684 --> 00:24:14,898
Cheng Xi!

314
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:16,402
Don't be scared!

315
00:24:17,604 --> 00:24:18,982
- What are you doing? - Don't be scared.

316
00:24:19,006 --> 00:24:20,522
Don't scare my client away.

317
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:23,978
- Your client? - Yeah. This is Madam Zhang.

318
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:25,213
Hello.

319
00:24:25,426 --> 00:24:26,986
I'm here to provide her with legal aid.

320
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,402
I thought you were kidnapped by Deng Ming.

321
00:24:31,249 --> 00:24:33,162
Since when was I kidnapped by Deng Ming?

322
00:24:33,329 --> 00:24:34,929
If so, why didn't you reply to my texts?

323
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:38,842
Sorry. I've put my phone on silent.

324
00:24:39,348 --> 00:24:40,824
Cheng Xi, I was so worried, you know?

325
00:24:40,848 --> 00:24:42,402
I thought someone was bullying you.

326
00:24:43,308 --> 00:24:44,762
Why were you shouting just now?

327
00:24:45,832 --> 00:24:47,202
It's because of that!

328
00:24:54,148 --> 00:24:55,602
Sorry for the embarrassment.

329
00:24:56,967 --> 00:25:00,067
You did look funny when the rat was chasing you.

330
00:25:00,225 --> 00:25:01,465
The rat was so fast.

331
00:25:01,546 --> 00:25:03,667
What if it bumps into you and hurts you?

332
00:25:03,747 --> 00:25:05,738
I was just trying to protect you.

333
00:25:06,761 --> 00:25:08,592
By standing behind me?

334
00:25:11,649 --> 00:25:12,879
Do you detest me now?

335
00:25:13,355 --> 00:25:15,682
Do you think I'm timid and unreliable?

336
00:25:16,756 --> 00:25:18,322
You're so timid.

337
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:20,880
Even so, you braved through the darkness just to save me.

338
00:25:21,613 --> 00:25:23,793
That means I'm very important to you.

339
00:25:23,874 --> 00:25:25,202
Of course.

340
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:26,686
Isn't that obvious?

341
00:25:30,314 --> 00:25:31,534
Wu Jun,

342
00:25:33,634 --> 00:25:35,522
thank you for always helping me out.

343
00:25:35,913 --> 00:25:37,383
I feel relieved

344
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,202
with you by my side.

345
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:45,896
- That's why I think we... - Wait. Don't say it first.

346
00:25:47,507 --> 00:25:49,162
This is too sudden.

347
00:25:49,953 --> 00:25:51,842
I feel nervous and shy.

348
00:25:52,675 --> 00:25:54,802
- If so, I... - Don't say it.

349
00:25:57,881 --> 00:26:00,682
First, this place isn't the most elegant.

350
00:26:00,912 --> 00:26:02,152
We're in the middle of nowhere.

351
00:26:02,256 --> 00:26:04,508
Let's find a better place before we talk about this.

352
00:26:04,658 --> 00:26:07,522
Second, I don't want to force you to return the favor.

353
00:26:07,971 --> 00:26:09,322
I didn't come here to save you

354
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:12,562
so that you could agree to date me.

355
00:26:14,017 --> 00:26:15,562
Don't be stressed out over that.

356
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,642
And, since we're adults,

357
00:26:17,723 --> 00:26:20,162
I hope our relationship consists of mutual feelings.

358
00:26:20,317 --> 00:26:23,067
It's best if both of us are into each other.

359
00:26:23,218 --> 00:26:25,442
I don't want to go on a roller coaster ride

360
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,722
just to find out that everything was false.

361
00:26:32,218 --> 00:26:33,438
All right.

362
00:26:34,014 --> 00:26:35,548
I'll reconsider it, then.

363
00:26:35,628 --> 00:26:36,667
No.

364
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:39,144
Why are you reconsidering it? I'm just saying

365
00:26:39,225 --> 00:26:41,065
that we should talk about this somewhere else.

366
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:44,698
I just want

367
00:26:45,095 --> 00:26:46,315
to follow your will, you know?

368
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,680
You don't need to follow my will for everything.

369
00:26:51,308 --> 00:26:54,648
Listen, I already have an excellent restaurant in mind.

370
00:26:54,749 --> 00:26:56,611
- What restaurant? - They serve excellent Shanghai cuisine.

371
00:26:56,635 --> 00:26:59,162
- I don't want that. - What about Spanish cuisine?

372
00:26:59,389 --> 00:27:01,268
Italian cuisine? What about French cuisine?

373
00:27:01,363 --> 00:27:02,583
I don't like that.

374
00:27:20,021 --> 00:27:21,962
I took on an international trust case.

375
00:27:22,573 --> 00:27:25,362
I hired a trust case expert to be your partner for the case.

376
00:27:26,507 --> 00:27:27,947
Why aren't you handling it yourself?

377
00:27:28,342 --> 00:27:30,122
I don't have the time. I'm busy.

378
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:31,469
Are you busy dating?

379
00:27:33,387 --> 00:27:35,107
I've served Junheng & Co for so many years.

380
00:27:35,148 --> 00:27:37,722
And now, I've finally made some progress in my relationship.

381
00:27:37,803 --> 00:27:39,308
Why are you mocking me for that?

382
00:27:39,546 --> 00:27:42,018
I've served Junheng & Co for many years too.

383
00:27:42,512 --> 00:27:44,334
Don't I need to get into a relationship and enjoy life?

384
00:27:44,358 --> 00:27:46,308
You? Getting into a relationship?

385
00:27:46,395 --> 00:27:47,615
You...

386
00:27:48,983 --> 00:27:52,217
I mean, how's the progress of your "friend?"

387
00:27:55,027 --> 00:27:56,482
Let me read the case.

388
00:27:56,874 --> 00:27:58,554
Don't tell me he didn't make any progress?

389
00:27:59,186 --> 00:28:00,988
Your friend is pretty bad at this.

390
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,468
Say another word,

391
00:28:02,594 --> 00:28:04,074
and you can handle the case yourself.

392
00:28:05,187 --> 00:28:06,407
Qian,

393
00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:10,640
don't you have anything to say to me today?

394
00:28:12,088 --> 00:28:13,308
What do I have to say to you?

395
00:28:13,577 --> 00:28:15,328
Don't you feel like

396
00:28:15,673 --> 00:28:17,044
there's something different about me today?

397
00:28:17,068 --> 00:28:18,602
Yeah. Go on.

398
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:20,202
Are you sick in the head?

399
00:28:20,458 --> 00:28:22,418
Is it serious? Do you need to go to the hospital?

400
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:34,682
Look at my necktie.

401
00:28:35,097 --> 00:28:36,317
Look at it.

402
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:38,190
What's wrong with it?

403
00:28:40,106 --> 00:28:41,975
Don't you think

404
00:28:42,497 --> 00:28:44,202
it looks exquisite

405
00:28:44,336 --> 00:28:45,556
and different?

406
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:47,303
And?

407
00:28:48,747 --> 00:28:50,362
Cheng Xi tied it for me.

408
00:28:50,913 --> 00:28:53,103
Are you sick in the head?

409
00:28:53,428 --> 00:28:55,488
This is my office, not your Moments on WeChat.

410
00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:57,089
You're showing off at the wrong place.

411
00:28:58,277 --> 00:29:00,122
You sound so jealous.

412
00:29:01,927 --> 00:29:03,526
Tell your friend to work harder.

413
00:29:03,631 --> 00:29:05,617
If not, I'll surpass him soon.

414
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:07,691
Forget it.

415
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,649
Why don't I lend you a hand

416
00:29:09,733 --> 00:29:11,897
and give you some support?

417
00:29:12,967 --> 00:29:15,353
When it comes to love, you're just like a kindergartner...

418
00:29:15,434 --> 00:29:16,654
What did you say?

419
00:29:18,752 --> 00:29:19,972
I said you were smart.

420
00:29:44,276 --> 00:29:45,344
Get in.

421
00:29:45,425 --> 00:29:47,580
What are you doing here? Where's Mr. Wang?

422
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:50,584
I told Mr. Wang that I was going to bring my boyfriend out for a meal.

423
00:29:50,665 --> 00:29:52,054
He passed the car keys to me.

424
00:30:02,537 --> 00:30:03,888
What did you call me again?

425
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,001
What did I call you?

426
00:30:08,858 --> 00:30:11,578
It's that...

427
00:30:11,791 --> 00:30:13,181
It's that term.

428
00:30:15,908 --> 00:30:17,282
Mr. Wang?

429
00:30:17,694 --> 00:30:19,937
No, the other term.

430
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,247
Car keys.

431
00:30:22,339 --> 00:30:23,762
No.

432
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,522
Stop teasing me. Come on.

433
00:30:25,823 --> 00:30:27,682
All right. Boyfriend.

434
00:30:28,397 --> 00:30:31,228
Your girlfriend is starving now. She wants to have lunch.

435
00:30:31,354 --> 00:30:32,574
Are we leaving or not?

436
00:30:32,801 --> 00:30:34,042
Let's go.

437
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:50,442
Bao Rui, send me the flight details.

438
00:30:50,686 --> 00:30:53,322
We'll talk about the case details on the plane tomorrow.

439
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:54,522
Okay.

440
00:30:55,776 --> 00:30:57,096
Are you going on a business trip?

441
00:30:57,567 --> 00:30:58,787
Why is it so sudden?

442
00:31:01,189 --> 00:31:04,020
Mainly, it's because I don't know where I stand now.

443
00:31:04,312 --> 00:31:06,482
You see, as one of the law firm's partners,

444
00:31:06,897 --> 00:31:08,697
I can't interfere with my subordinates' work.

445
00:31:08,753 --> 00:31:10,023
As a boyfriend,

446
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:12,719
I cannot go on a date with my girlfriend in public.

447
00:31:13,217 --> 00:31:15,657
I feel like my existence itself is extra.

448
00:31:16,203 --> 00:31:18,373
That's why I have no choice but to go on a business trip.

449
00:31:18,397 --> 00:31:19,852
That's pretty good. This way,

450
00:31:19,933 --> 00:31:22,173
I don't need to share the living room with someone else.

451
00:31:22,337 --> 00:31:23,557
I don't believe you.

452
00:31:23,791 --> 00:31:25,391
I'm sure you can't bear to part with me.

453
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,215
Let me see if there's anything you forgot to bring.

454
00:31:28,726 --> 00:31:29,946
That's unnecessary.

455
00:31:30,034 --> 00:31:32,154
I can buy them at the local store if I lack anything.

456
00:31:32,284 --> 00:31:36,294
It seems like there's nothing you miss here, huh?

457
00:31:38,714 --> 00:31:40,242
That's not true.

458
00:31:40,484 --> 00:31:42,124
I'm not used to the world out there.

459
00:31:42,281 --> 00:31:43,619
That's why I have to come back as soon as possible.

460
00:31:43,643 --> 00:31:44,722
Really?

461
00:31:48,312 --> 00:31:49,762
When will you come back, then?

462
00:31:50,017 --> 00:31:51,537
Very soon. I'll come back in one week.

463
00:31:52,682 --> 00:31:54,187
I'll wait for you at home, then.

464
00:31:54,298 --> 00:31:55,518
Focus on your work.

465
00:31:56,891 --> 00:31:58,531
If you do miss me,

466
00:31:58,612 --> 00:32:01,907
I'll allow you to check the living room's surveillance camera.

467
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:03,433
But you can't spy on me when I sleep.

468
00:32:03,457 --> 00:32:04,562
Okay.

469
00:32:07,202 --> 00:32:08,493
Your hair isn't dry.

470
00:32:08,574 --> 00:32:10,134
That won't do. I'll get the blow dryer.

471
00:32:10,186 --> 00:32:11,322
Okay.

472
00:32:44,957 --> 00:32:48,082
(VIP Lounge)

473
00:32:52,123 --> 00:32:54,482
Boss, here's your coffee.

474
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,482
You look great today.

475
00:33:01,218 --> 00:33:02,642
Did something good happen?

476
00:33:03,533 --> 00:33:05,442
I'm happy as long as you're happy.

477
00:33:05,707 --> 00:33:07,075
You should share the occasion with me.

478
00:33:07,099 --> 00:33:09,899
Give me the name list of the lawyers who will participate in the case.

479
00:33:11,831 --> 00:33:13,051
Lawyer Qian.

480
00:33:28,403 --> 00:33:29,762
Lawyer Qian, Lawyer Bao.

481
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:31,988
I'm Liang Yi Ran, your partner for the case.

482
00:33:32,138 --> 00:33:35,427
We have around 35 minutes before the flight.

483
00:33:35,537 --> 00:33:37,042
We can discuss the case first.

484
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:39,116
I'm used to getting an initial direction of

485
00:33:39,197 --> 00:33:41,122
the case before meeting my clients.

486
00:33:42,427 --> 00:33:45,338
Boss, she's just like the female version of you.

487
00:33:48,457 --> 00:33:50,337
No problem. May we have a pleasant cooperation.

488
00:33:50,618 --> 00:33:52,018
May we have a pleasant cooperation.

489
00:33:59,254 --> 00:34:00,474
(Guys!)

490
00:34:00,937 --> 00:34:03,207
(I think Lawyer Liang will win our boss's heart.)

491
00:34:04,364 --> 00:34:05,584
Lawyer Qian,

492
00:34:06,122 --> 00:34:08,002
this is the client's foreign asset profile.

493
00:34:08,083 --> 00:34:09,992
I already told our firm to translate

494
00:34:10,073 --> 00:34:11,903
and organize them.

495
00:34:12,099 --> 00:34:15,177
Lawyer Qian, I wish to hear your opinion on it.

496
00:34:15,968 --> 00:34:17,041
Okay.

497
00:34:20,104 --> 00:34:21,324
Bao Rui,

498
00:34:21,945 --> 00:34:24,385
why didn't you send the client's foreign asset profile to me?

499
00:34:27,627 --> 00:34:29,147
- Come and see. - That's impossible.

500
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:34,227
I didn't even receive this email.

501
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:35,839
It's not Lawyer Bao's fault.

502
00:34:36,021 --> 00:34:38,200
The documents sent by our client's overseas corporate email

503
00:34:38,224 --> 00:34:40,236
will end up in the Junk folder most of the time.

504
00:34:40,388 --> 00:34:42,442
Even I would miss out on them sometimes.

505
00:34:42,523 --> 00:34:43,743
That's right.

506
00:34:45,348 --> 00:34:47,108
Sorry about this. We were negligent.

507
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,423
Thanks for the help.

508
00:34:48,745 --> 00:34:51,685
I'm looking forward to cooperating with Junheng & Co as well.

509
00:34:57,317 --> 00:34:58,336
(You're welcome.)

510
00:34:58,417 --> 00:34:59,967
(May you get a date soon.)

511
00:35:07,889 --> 00:35:09,278
(You're mistaken.)

512
00:35:19,387 --> 00:35:20,522
Boss,

513
00:35:21,198 --> 00:35:22,243
are you tired?

514
00:35:22,324 --> 00:35:23,762
Just now, I...

515
00:35:23,882 --> 00:35:25,711
I know my fault now.

516
00:35:45,587 --> 00:35:46,788
Lin Feng Juan,

517
00:35:46,993 --> 00:35:48,393
I suggest you withdraw the lawsuit.

518
00:35:49,409 --> 00:35:51,082
I feel disgusted for my lawyer

519
00:35:51,331 --> 00:35:53,651
that he has to engage in a lawsuit with a person like you.

520
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:02,682
Don't worry. The lawsuit you filed was logical and reasonable.

521
00:36:02,825 --> 00:36:04,402
And, we have complete evidence too.

522
00:36:04,624 --> 00:36:05,844
Let's go.

523
00:36:10,761 --> 00:36:13,002
Judge Meng, we meet again.

524
00:36:13,906 --> 00:36:17,175
I heard that your daughter, Lan, was going to have her teeth corrected.

525
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:20,667
A friend of mine just opened a high-class dental clinic.

526
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,370
I'll share his WeChat profile with you.

527
00:36:22,649 --> 00:36:24,362
- Sure. - Okay.

528
00:36:30,106 --> 00:36:33,937
Lawyer Cheng, is Lu Jian's lawyer friends with the judge?

529
00:36:34,121 --> 00:36:35,922
The judge won't cover up for them, right?

530
00:36:36,105 --> 00:36:38,136
She won't. We must trust the law.

531
00:36:40,081 --> 00:36:41,301
Yao Yao.

532
00:36:42,227 --> 00:36:45,282
No, I should address you as Lawyer Cheng.

533
00:36:45,528 --> 00:36:47,108
I've never expected us

534
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,640
to see each other in the court one day.

535
00:36:50,021 --> 00:36:51,882
Say, should I be happy for you?

536
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:53,508
Or should I be worried for you?

537
00:36:55,052 --> 00:36:57,346
Lawyer Deng, I never expected you to take on such cases.

538
00:36:57,482 --> 00:36:58,591
No choice.

539
00:36:58,672 --> 00:36:59,892
I'm soft-hearted.

540
00:37:00,349 --> 00:37:02,787
I have to help uphold justice for men

541
00:37:02,907 --> 00:37:04,227
who are scammed by devious women.

542
00:37:05,193 --> 00:37:06,408
When it comes to being devious,

543
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,742
you're second to none.

544
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:10,070
Yeah.

545
00:37:10,754 --> 00:37:12,714
Being devious is better than lacking discernment.

546
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:19,467
Lin Feng Juan filed a lawsuit against Lu Jian

547
00:37:19,591 --> 00:37:21,974
for the father-son relationship conflict.

548
00:37:22,107 --> 00:37:23,947
The evidence that the plaintiff had submitted

549
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:26,716
has been sent to the defendant in court.

550
00:37:26,797 --> 00:37:29,562
Does the defendant have any evidence to submit?

551
00:37:29,703 --> 00:37:31,654
Yes, Your Honor.

552
00:37:46,908 --> 00:37:48,128
Shen.

553
00:37:52,306 --> 00:37:55,255
Both parties, please present your evidence.

554
00:37:55,577 --> 00:37:56,797
Plaintiff?

555
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,784
Our evidence is in line with our objective of evidence

556
00:38:00,808 --> 00:38:02,357
and the list of evidence.

557
00:38:03,953 --> 00:38:05,173
Defendant?

558
00:38:06,067 --> 00:38:07,228
Judge Meng,

559
00:38:07,435 --> 00:38:09,188
unfortunately, my client, Mr. Lu,

560
00:38:09,411 --> 00:38:15,282
was deemed by the hospital to be azoospermic long ago.

561
00:38:15,392 --> 00:38:17,762
And, he has congenital anorchia,

562
00:38:17,843 --> 00:38:19,522
which can never be cured.

563
00:38:21,127 --> 00:38:23,042
That's impossible.

564
00:38:23,161 --> 00:38:25,242
- Ms. Lin? - I gave birth to Han.

565
00:38:25,828 --> 00:38:28,322
How could he be azoospermic?

566
00:38:28,536 --> 00:38:29,668
- Calm down. - Ms. Lin.

567
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:32,327
I don't know if your lawyer has ever told you this or not.

568
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,026
This is the court.

569
00:38:34,223 --> 00:38:35,876
Just because you raise your voice

570
00:38:35,957 --> 00:38:37,437
doesn't mean that you hold the truth.

571
00:38:37,512 --> 00:38:39,031
The evidence we showed is true.

572
00:38:39,112 --> 00:38:40,332
You may take a look.

573
00:38:40,708 --> 00:38:42,987
It's fake. This is fake!

574
00:38:43,082 --> 00:38:44,455
- Ms. Lin! - This is fake!

575
00:38:44,536 --> 00:38:46,202
Han is still in the hospital!

576
00:38:46,364 --> 00:38:48,217
You're his biological father.

577
00:38:49,395 --> 00:38:51,105
Judge Meng, just like what my client had said,

578
00:38:51,129 --> 00:38:52,762
not only did the plaintiff

579
00:38:52,879 --> 00:38:54,628
lack moral values that women should have,

580
00:38:54,738 --> 00:38:56,458
but she's also guilty of contempt of court.

581
00:38:56,489 --> 00:38:59,297
She tore the copy of our evidence we submitted to the court.

582
00:38:59,658 --> 00:39:00,978
According to civil procedure law,

583
00:39:01,004 --> 00:39:02,507
she destroyed important evidence

584
00:39:02,629 --> 00:39:04,682
and obstructed the court in handling a lawsuit.

585
00:39:06,627 --> 00:39:07,748
Judge Meng,

586
00:39:07,903 --> 00:39:10,538
I believe that you will punish her accordingly.

587
00:39:10,989 --> 00:39:12,042
Plaintiff, Ms. Lin,

588
00:39:12,153 --> 00:39:13,373
mind your conduct.

589
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,367
Sorry.

590
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:22,631
I deserve this.

591
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,332
This must be my retribution.

592
00:39:24,356 --> 00:39:25,576
Ms. Lin!

593
00:39:31,748 --> 00:39:33,961
Not only does the plaintiff lack moral values,

594
00:39:34,064 --> 00:39:35,813
but I think she's also a bit mental.

595
00:39:38,066 --> 00:39:39,577
But I can understand why.

596
00:39:40,023 --> 00:39:41,708
I would suffer from a mental breakdown too

597
00:39:41,922 --> 00:39:44,386
if the lawyer I hired just stood there

598
00:39:44,592 --> 00:39:46,312
like a piece of log without doing anything.

599
00:39:48,035 --> 00:39:50,220
All right. I guess we can't proceed with the case today.

600
00:39:50,244 --> 00:39:51,464
If so, farewell.

601
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:54,122
Judge Meng, sorry for the embarrassment.

602
00:40:13,403 --> 00:40:16,627
Lawyer Cheng, this kind of occurrence is common in the court.

603
00:40:16,796 --> 00:40:19,066
If your plaintiff intends to give up,

604
00:40:19,224 --> 00:40:22,378
please withdraw the lawsuit on her behalf.

605
00:40:23,547 --> 00:40:24,817
Sorry, Judge Meng.

606
00:40:29,497 --> 00:40:31,326
But my client belongs to the weaker side.

607
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,551
I wish to fight for her.

608
00:40:33,707 --> 00:40:36,107
All right. As long as you can continue

609
00:40:36,188 --> 00:40:37,919
to provide us with the complete evidence chain,

610
00:40:37,943 --> 00:40:39,697
the court won't side with either side.

611
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:41,322
Thank you.

612
00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:44,682
Shen.

613
00:40:59,689 --> 00:41:01,762
(What the heck is anorchia?)

614
00:41:36,701 --> 00:41:40,322
(Hello. The number you have dialed is busy.)

615
00:41:40,412 --> 00:41:41,883
(Please try again later.)

616
00:41:54,951 --> 00:41:57,108
(Will this condition affect one's virility?)

617
00:41:57,349 --> 00:42:00,962
(I mean, will it affect the individual if he consummates with someone?)

618
00:42:01,988 --> 00:42:05,018
(If so, is there any medicine that one can take)

619
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:06,979
(to restore his virility just for the session?)

620
00:42:07,028 --> 00:42:08,037
Cheng Yao!

621
00:42:08,169 --> 00:42:09,442
(What are you doing?)

622
00:42:10,627 --> 00:42:12,498
Sorry about that. I'll call you again later.

623
00:42:13,084 --> 00:42:14,842
(You scared me.)

624
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,545
You said I could check the surveillance camera.

625
00:42:16,569 --> 00:42:17,669
I would have no idea that you were doing this

626
00:42:17,693 --> 00:42:19,297
behind my back had I not checked it.

627
00:42:19,443 --> 00:42:20,732
What have I done?

628
00:42:20,818 --> 00:42:23,088
Shouldn't I be the one questioning you here?

629
00:42:24,337 --> 00:42:25,557
Let me clarify myself.

630
00:42:26,018 --> 00:42:27,378
I only found out

631
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:29,734
that I was working with the female lawyer in Bao Rui's picture

632
00:42:29,758 --> 00:42:31,162
(after coming here.)

633
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:33,686
What picture?

634
00:42:33,912 --> 00:42:35,222
(I haven't seen it yet.)

635
00:42:37,339 --> 00:42:38,538
It's nothing.

636
00:42:38,641 --> 00:42:40,152
I mean,

637
00:42:40,512 --> 00:42:42,832
if you don't like me working together with female lawyers,

638
00:42:43,044 --> 00:42:44,204
(I can choose not to take on)

639
00:42:44,247 --> 00:42:46,317
(cases that feature other female lawyers next time.)

640
00:42:46,341 --> 00:42:49,722
You can tell me directly if you wish to speed up

641
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:51,202
the progress of our relationship.

642
00:42:51,293 --> 00:42:54,353
(However, you must never doubt my ability, especially in that area.)

643
00:42:58,563 --> 00:42:59,783
You mustn't doubt me.

644
00:43:01,349 --> 00:43:03,298
What were you thinking?

645
00:43:04,947 --> 00:43:06,167
What are you laughing at?

646
00:43:08,392 --> 00:43:10,591
(Wait. I'll give you a video call.)

647
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:12,143
(I need to see you too.)

648
00:43:16,912 --> 00:43:18,132
(Stop laughing.)

649
00:43:18,746 --> 00:43:21,282
But you were really funny when you were being presumptuous.

650
00:43:21,423 --> 00:43:23,522
It's all because I cared about you, you know?
