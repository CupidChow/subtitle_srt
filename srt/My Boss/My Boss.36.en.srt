1
00:01:35,567 --> 00:01:38,842
(My Boss)

2
00:01:39,772 --> 00:01:42,214
(Episode 36)

3
00:01:42,295 --> 00:01:45,202
(You're the only irresistible force in my life)

4
00:02:18,093 --> 00:02:19,682
It's great to be on holiday.

5
00:02:30,372 --> 00:02:31,592
You're awake.

6
00:02:32,108 --> 00:02:33,934
Do you want to have Western food with tea,

7
00:02:34,014 --> 00:02:35,482
dim sum, or fruit salad?

8
00:02:35,563 --> 00:02:36,723
I prepared all three of them.

9
00:02:36,827 --> 00:02:38,562
Don't you need to work today?

10
00:02:38,773 --> 00:02:41,934
I plan to take a long break and enjoy our time together.

11
00:02:43,138 --> 00:02:45,322
Today is the template for the coming days.

12
00:02:48,973 --> 00:02:50,082
Good girl.

13
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:55,235
We can clean up the house after our meal.

14
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,199
I plan to organize the books in our house

15
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,934
according to Dewey Decimal Classification.

16
00:03:00,122 --> 00:03:01,442
I'll wax the floor

17
00:03:01,577 --> 00:03:03,397
and sanitize everything.

18
00:03:03,801 --> 00:03:05,241
Are you sure about that?

19
00:03:06,002 --> 00:03:08,202
I was just kidding. Go and wash up.

20
00:03:08,285 --> 00:03:09,505
Time to eat.

21
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:15,778
I never expected Qian Heng to do chores with you.

22
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:18,882
It's more than that. It's military training.

23
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,502
What's going on?

24
00:03:20,761 --> 00:03:23,162
Qian Heng has become a househusband?

25
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,921
Cheng Yao, let me remind you of this.

26
00:03:25,242 --> 00:03:27,482
Qian Heng doesn't know how to use a gas stove.

27
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,016
Don't let him burn your house down.

28
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,440
- That was terrifying. - Cheng Yao.

29
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:35,001
Cheng Yao, what happened?

30
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:36,606
- Is Qian Heng still around? - What's going on?

31
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,909
(Do you need me to call the emergency hotline?)

32
00:03:39,056 --> 00:03:41,576
Don't worry. The popcorn is ready.

33
00:03:42,283 --> 00:03:43,721
I made some popcorn for Cheng Yao.

34
00:03:43,802 --> 00:03:45,922
(Do you guys want some? I'll keep some for you guys.)

35
00:03:46,282 --> 00:03:47,502
No thanks.

36
00:03:48,442 --> 00:03:49,662
It's chocolate-flavored?

37
00:03:50,562 --> 00:03:52,442
Will I gain weight after having this?

38
00:03:52,782 --> 00:03:54,962
It's fine. We can do one set of HIIT later.

39
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:56,457
It's high-intensity interval training.

40
00:03:56,481 --> 00:03:57,762
After that, we'll run 10km.

41
00:03:59,722 --> 00:04:01,521
Cheng Xi, I'll hang up first.

42
00:04:03,601 --> 00:04:06,121
Are we on holiday? Or is this military training?

43
00:04:06,522 --> 00:04:08,922
- This is our life. - Stop that.

44
00:04:11,162 --> 00:04:13,882
I never expected Qian Heng to be like this even in his relationship.

45
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,141
He's sick in the head.

46
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:18,361
- Did you queue up just to buy this? - Of course.

47
00:04:18,441 --> 00:04:20,642
I'm surely better than him, right?

48
00:04:22,587 --> 00:04:24,482
He may be a boss, but I'm a boss too.

49
00:04:25,206 --> 00:04:26,726
If he can give himself a break,

50
00:04:27,425 --> 00:04:28,645
I can do the same.

51
00:04:29,322 --> 00:04:30,542
Let's go.

52
00:04:31,202 --> 00:04:33,182
Let's travel.

53
00:04:34,776 --> 00:04:35,996
President Zhang,

54
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,402
you complained about the PCs in the Law Association, right?

55
00:04:40,243 --> 00:04:43,362
Our law firm is upgrading our system now.

56
00:04:43,506 --> 00:04:45,802
I've replaced the PCs here with new ones.

57
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:47,561
They'll be installed by tomorrow.

58
00:04:49,082 --> 00:04:50,281
Lawyer Deng,

59
00:04:50,446 --> 00:04:53,362
last time, you provided our members with a tooth treatment program.

60
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:55,201
Now, you're buying us a new batch of PCs.

61
00:04:55,946 --> 00:04:58,802
It must've been expensive. You're truly a generous sponsor.

62
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,881
- It's my duty. - Come, let's have some tea.

63
00:05:02,121 --> 00:05:05,681
Dewei & Co is able to develop well

64
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:08,938
all thanks to your guidance, President Zhang.

65
00:05:09,322 --> 00:05:10,401
You mustn't say that.

66
00:05:10,481 --> 00:05:13,122
I was just giving suggestions

67
00:05:13,202 --> 00:05:15,454
within my scope.

68
00:05:15,535 --> 00:05:17,816
- That's all. - That's right.

69
00:05:19,756 --> 00:05:20,976
President Zhang,

70
00:05:21,601 --> 00:05:24,341
the Golden Scale Award will be held soon.

71
00:05:24,481 --> 00:05:27,402
Which law firm do you think will win the award?

72
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,361
Lawyer Deng, the selection

73
00:05:31,441 --> 00:05:32,921
is decided by the Law Association.

74
00:05:33,001 --> 00:05:35,102
My opinion doesn't matter.

75
00:05:39,322 --> 00:05:40,542
However, I heard

76
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,321
that there was a dark horse this year.

77
00:05:43,642 --> 00:05:44,862
It's Junheng & Co.

78
00:05:46,642 --> 00:05:47,897
- Junheng & Co? - That's right.

79
00:05:47,921 --> 00:05:48,962
No.

80
00:05:49,522 --> 00:05:51,642
President Zhang, you must be kidding me.

81
00:05:51,722 --> 00:05:53,841
Didn't you say Qian Heng only had eyes for money

82
00:05:53,998 --> 00:05:55,519
- and that he was unreliable? - Yes.

83
00:05:55,673 --> 00:05:57,442
That was what I said before.

84
00:05:57,601 --> 00:06:00,241
But Junheng & Co changed a lot this year.

85
00:06:00,842 --> 00:06:03,282
Before this, they were aggressive.

86
00:06:03,432 --> 00:06:05,632
This year, they're much gentler.

87
00:06:06,402 --> 00:06:09,682
After Lawyer Cheng Xi joined them,

88
00:06:09,863 --> 00:06:12,022
they also established a Public Welfare Department.

89
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,503
Lawyer Deng,

90
00:06:14,584 --> 00:06:17,704
this might be a huge challenge for you as well.

91
00:06:21,626 --> 00:06:22,907
It is.

92
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:31,002
Are you not done with Wanli Group's contract yet?

93
00:06:31,082 --> 00:06:32,844
Wanli Group just called

94
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:34,672
and told us that they're not using our services this year.

95
00:06:34,696 --> 00:06:36,536
They're hiring Junheng & Co to do it for them.

96
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,261
Junheng & Co again?

97
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:50,102
I don't know if Junheng & Co is the jinx or you.

98
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,402
It's my fault again?

99
00:07:23,762 --> 00:07:25,082
Reporter Shen.

100
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,561
Are you busy? Let's have a chat.

101
00:07:29,561 --> 00:07:31,362
I have some shocking news for you.

102
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:33,306
I wonder if you'll be interested in it or not.

103
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,920
This year's Golden Scale Award's winner had been decided internally.

104
00:07:40,842 --> 00:07:42,041
Why should I lie to you?

105
00:07:42,121 --> 00:07:43,341
It's true.

106
00:07:44,078 --> 00:07:48,202
That's not it. I'll tell you the details when we meet, okay?

107
00:07:48,481 --> 00:07:51,521
Director Li, the director of Lawyers' Debate,

108
00:07:51,601 --> 00:07:52,881
you should invite him too.

109
00:07:53,336 --> 00:07:56,202
You see, this is huge news.

110
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,642
We have to cooperate.

111
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:00,328
Not only will you uphold justice for Dewei & Co,

112
00:08:00,601 --> 00:08:02,161
but it'll also generate a hot topic.

113
00:08:02,241 --> 00:08:03,481
Isn't that a win-win situation?

114
00:08:04,801 --> 00:08:06,021
Okay.

115
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,679
Okay. See you.

116
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,840
I only went out for the afternoon.

117
00:08:16,961 --> 00:08:18,441
Why is everyone talking about us now?

118
00:08:18,481 --> 00:08:21,442
People outside are saying that Lawyer Qian is caught in a car accident

119
00:08:21,522 --> 00:08:23,866
or plans to retire since he's taking a long break after so long.

120
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,682
And, people are saying that he's going on a strike

121
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,060
because he fell out with you.

122
00:08:31,738 --> 00:08:32,958
Lawyer Wu.

123
00:08:33,882 --> 00:08:35,322
Why did you two come back so early?

124
00:08:35,402 --> 00:08:37,098
Didn't you two attend the Law Association's meeting on Qian Heng's behalf?

125
00:08:37,122 --> 00:08:38,482
We did. It was lively there.

126
00:08:38,616 --> 00:08:40,935
All of them said that Lawyer Qian was retiring.

127
00:08:41,359 --> 00:08:43,882
If Lawyer Qian is retiring, I'll retire too.

128
00:08:44,054 --> 00:08:45,082
As if.

129
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,770
They were even saying that Lawyer Qian

130
00:08:46,801 --> 00:08:48,226
went into hiding after committing a crime.

131
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,969
It's just that you suppressed the news.

132
00:08:56,441 --> 00:08:57,661
Don't make a sound.

133
00:09:00,002 --> 00:09:01,002
Hello?

134
00:09:01,595 --> 00:09:03,722
Hello, Mr. Chen.

135
00:09:04,681 --> 00:09:05,901
What?

136
00:09:06,103 --> 00:09:09,943
Qian Heng was penalized due to his manipulation of the Golden Scale Award?

137
00:09:11,841 --> 00:09:13,841
Impossible. This is definitely a misunderstanding.

138
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:17,721
Mr. Chen, calm down.

139
00:09:17,801 --> 00:09:19,498
Give me some time. I'll get to the bottom of this.

140
00:09:19,522 --> 00:09:21,299
After that, I'll give you an accurate answer.

141
00:09:21,323 --> 00:09:22,543
Okay?

142
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:24,641
Okay, then.

143
00:09:28,841 --> 00:09:31,761
Our new client, which hired Dewei & Co before this, has hired them again.

144
00:09:31,801 --> 00:09:33,481
That means Deng Ming is behind this.

145
00:09:33,623 --> 00:09:34,843
Look at this.

146
00:09:35,455 --> 00:09:36,855
(As a lawyer, )

147
00:09:37,022 --> 00:09:38,609
(I have zero tolerance)

148
00:09:38,721 --> 00:09:41,482
(for people who try to manipulate the Golden Scale Award)

149
00:09:41,762 --> 00:09:43,922
(and break the rules of the industry.)

150
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,590
Deng Ming?

151
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,335
Stop frowning.

152
00:09:56,831 --> 00:09:57,910
It's not a huge deal.

153
00:09:57,991 --> 00:09:59,311
It's just Deng Ming.

154
00:09:59,491 --> 00:10:01,042
I'll deal with him.

155
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:12,082
Don't you guys trust my ability?

156
00:10:14,801 --> 00:10:15,961
(After a long wait, )

157
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,121
(we've finally managed to invite)

158
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,602
(Deng Ming, a two-time winner of the Golden Scale Award, to our show.)

159
00:10:21,762 --> 00:10:25,162
(Hello, I'm everyone's professional lawyer)

160
00:10:25,265 --> 00:10:27,042
(and your friend, Deng Ming.)

161
00:10:27,522 --> 00:10:29,281
(Actually, I feel pretty ashamed.)

162
00:10:29,402 --> 00:10:31,343
(I try to avoid mentioning the fact that I won)

163
00:10:31,443 --> 00:10:33,443
(the Golden Scale Award twice in a row in public.)

164
00:10:33,561 --> 00:10:34,601
(After all, )

165
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,080
(this award no longer has the same amount of gold content.)

166
00:10:38,201 --> 00:10:40,001
(And, it's no longer fair either.)

167
00:10:40,081 --> 00:10:41,121
(I even think)

168
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:43,580
(that this show, Lawyers' Debate, is better than the award itself.)

169
00:10:43,604 --> 00:10:47,024
(Am I right? I can provide the audience with basic legal education.)

170
00:10:47,282 --> 00:10:48,682
(This is very meaningful.)

171
00:10:48,793 --> 00:10:51,233
(Indeed. There are many candidates who have been nominated, )

172
00:10:51,321 --> 00:10:54,121
(even the lawyer who's known as)

173
00:10:54,304 --> 00:10:56,721
(the tumor of the industry.)

174
00:10:56,801 --> 00:10:59,077
(Lawyer Deng Ming, we're very thankful that you chose to speak up)

175
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:01,082
(and support our show.)

176
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:02,962
(As a lawyer, I support public welfare shows)

177
00:11:03,056 --> 00:11:05,602
(like yours unconditionally.)

178
00:11:06,122 --> 00:11:07,442
(Am I right? A lawyer...)

179
00:11:08,359 --> 00:11:10,039
What was that all about?

180
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,482
It's fine. Why don't we watch a movie?

181
00:11:13,561 --> 00:11:15,578
Why did their program team invite a guest like him?

182
00:11:15,602 --> 00:11:16,641
He was slandering you.

183
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,650
It's fine. He doesn't have any evidence anyway.

184
00:11:20,801 --> 00:11:22,521
I'm going to file a complaint against them.

185
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,911
I think your complaint is useless.

186
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:31,657
Deng Ming is a regular guest on law-themed variety shows.

187
00:11:31,681 --> 00:11:33,441
He's the best at instigating public emotion.

188
00:11:33,921 --> 00:11:36,402
You should defeat him in court and make him fear you.

189
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:39,110
But I'm angry that he's doing this to you.

190
00:11:45,681 --> 00:11:47,082
Have you ever thought of

191
00:11:47,163 --> 00:11:49,503
clarifying things by showing up on the show?

192
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,122
The law information you provided to me before this

193
00:11:54,234 --> 00:11:56,722
is also suitable for the audience there,

194
00:11:56,961 --> 00:11:58,042
am I right?

195
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,537
You'll be doing your part to construct the country's law environment.

196
00:12:00,561 --> 00:12:01,841
Don't you think it's meaningful?

197
00:12:05,282 --> 00:12:06,481
That won't do.

198
00:12:06,584 --> 00:12:07,944
I only work for money.

199
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:09,442
And now, I only work for you.

200
00:12:09,665 --> 00:12:10,946
Stop that.

201
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,780
I'll get you some water.

202
00:12:13,561 --> 00:12:14,781
Have them while they're hot.

203
00:12:17,097 --> 00:12:19,976
(No, I can't just let Deng Ming subvert the truth.)

204
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:25,218
I know this has caused you a lot of trouble.

205
00:12:25,242 --> 00:12:26,817
Hello. I'm here to look for Director Li,

206
00:12:26,841 --> 00:12:28,161
- the director of Lawyers' Debate. - That's why I...

207
00:12:28,185 --> 00:12:30,204
Director Li, someone else is looking for you.

208
00:12:30,602 --> 00:12:32,822
Cheng Yao? Were you looking for me?

209
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:35,119
- Thank you. - Give me a moment.

210
00:12:36,112 --> 00:12:37,633
I haven't finished my words yet.

211
00:12:38,242 --> 00:12:40,761
Junheng & Co is a law firm co-founded by Qian Heng and I.

212
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:42,715
However, we have different job scopes.

213
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:44,881
I leave most of the frontline work to Qian Heng.

214
00:12:44,961 --> 00:12:48,522
However, I do have certificates and awards from competitions as well.

215
00:12:48,703 --> 00:12:50,502
I can deal with Deng Ming just fine.

216
00:12:50,681 --> 00:12:52,202
Hello, Director Li. I'm Cheng Yao.

217
00:12:52,282 --> 00:12:53,722
I defeated Deng Ming in court before.

218
00:12:53,746 --> 00:12:54,966
I hope you can consider me.

219
00:12:56,135 --> 00:12:57,322
I wish to give it a try too.

220
00:12:57,441 --> 00:12:59,762
I know both of you are outstanding lawyers.

221
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,580
I'm not doubting your abilities by any means.

222
00:13:02,762 --> 00:13:05,030
But Lawyer Wu, you didn't make an appearance for a long time.

223
00:13:05,054 --> 00:13:07,261
And Lawyer Cheng, you're a newbie.

224
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,562
This is a variety show after all.

225
00:13:09,642 --> 00:13:10,841
You know what we want.

226
00:13:10,921 --> 00:13:11,961
We want hot topics.

227
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,321
We want to be on the search bar.

228
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,055
However,

229
00:13:16,561 --> 00:13:18,722
if Qian Heng can make an appearance.

230
00:13:19,081 --> 00:13:20,602
That'll be great.

231
00:13:23,482 --> 00:13:25,442
Do you think I'm inferior to him?

232
00:13:25,522 --> 00:13:26,641
That's not it.

233
00:13:26,721 --> 00:13:28,161
You're inferior to me.

234
00:13:50,522 --> 00:13:52,601
I might not be able

235
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:54,481
to control myself when I defeat Deng Ming.

236
00:13:54,647 --> 00:13:56,568
I can only show you

237
00:13:56,681 --> 00:13:57,901
total dominance.

238
00:14:02,872 --> 00:14:05,312
That's great! That's the line I want.

239
00:14:08,362 --> 00:14:10,479
It's great that you're willing to clarify things yourself.

240
00:14:10,503 --> 00:14:11,982
This way, we won't need to worry.

241
00:14:12,553 --> 00:14:14,553
I didn't say I would attend that show necessarily.

242
00:14:14,827 --> 00:14:16,602
You just signed a contract, you know?

243
00:14:16,683 --> 00:14:18,843
You're a lawyer. You should know what's at stake here.

244
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:22,121
Do you think I can't afford the penalty for breaching the contract?

245
00:14:23,608 --> 00:14:25,881
What about this? If you attend the show,

246
00:14:25,961 --> 00:14:28,562
I'll stay at home and work overtime with you for one month.

247
00:14:28,696 --> 00:14:30,200
Yao Yao, let me remind you of something.

248
00:14:30,224 --> 00:14:31,464
I'm on leave right now.

249
00:14:31,545 --> 00:14:33,522
And, I've decided to focus on family.

250
00:14:33,648 --> 00:14:36,508
What if I prepare supper for you for one month?

251
00:14:36,992 --> 00:14:38,432
Supper?

252
00:14:38,871 --> 00:14:40,191
That's unhealthy.

253
00:14:40,801 --> 00:14:42,021
What do you want, then?

254
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,338
You want me to make an appearance?

255
00:14:46,362 --> 00:14:48,421
Fine. But I have several conditions.

256
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:53,113
To realize the goal of a healthy life,

257
00:14:53,201 --> 00:14:55,601
Qian Heng and Cheng Yao need to fulfill the following terms.

258
00:14:56,561 --> 00:14:59,362
First, intermittent fasting has to be practiced once per week.

259
00:14:59,681 --> 00:15:01,742
And, sugar intake must be controlled.

260
00:15:01,952 --> 00:15:05,032
Second, at least three gym or swimming sessions are required per week.

261
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:06,389
I'll be your personal trainer.

262
00:15:06,483 --> 00:15:09,442
Third, at least one book on economics must be read per month.

263
00:15:09,522 --> 00:15:11,282
And, you must attempt to learn philosophy.

264
00:15:11,362 --> 00:15:12,682
- Fourth... - I know now.

265
00:15:12,783 --> 00:15:15,162
You want to join a girl group, right?

266
00:15:16,122 --> 00:15:17,342
Fine, then.

267
00:15:17,673 --> 00:15:18,978
I won't make an appearance on the show.

268
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:20,242
Go and tell the director.

269
00:15:20,324 --> 00:15:22,442
They'll get compensated for it anyway.

270
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:24,482
I don't think they'll disagree with it.

271
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,841
Fine. I'll be your personal assistant

272
00:15:26,921 --> 00:15:29,030
if you're willing to make an appearance.

273
00:15:29,111 --> 00:15:30,331
Remember your promise.

274
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:36,421
Hello?

275
00:15:37,242 --> 00:15:38,722
Yes. It's me, Qian Heng.

276
00:15:40,402 --> 00:15:42,161
You want me to do a short clip?

277
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,722
All right, I'll pass the phone to my assistant.

278
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:52,421
Hello?

279
00:15:53,216 --> 00:15:54,817
A short clip, right?

280
00:15:55,216 --> 00:15:56,897
Let me confirm Lawyer Qian's schedule first.

281
00:15:56,921 --> 00:15:58,001
I'll get back to you later.

282
00:15:58,081 --> 00:15:59,301
Thank you.

283
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:02,882
- You're such a professional. - You're getting ahead of yourself here.

284
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,261
Let's go.

285
00:16:19,704 --> 00:16:21,177
Excuse me. Only staff is allowed here.

286
00:16:21,201 --> 00:16:22,602
She's my assistant.

287
00:16:23,321 --> 00:16:24,541
Okay.

288
00:16:26,921 --> 00:16:29,202
Get me the beauty blender.

289
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,842
She's my personal assistant.

290
00:16:32,976 --> 00:16:34,196
She only serves me.

291
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,804
Sorry about that.

292
00:16:40,135 --> 00:16:43,162
This makeup doesn't look good on me.

293
00:16:43,425 --> 00:16:44,745
It doesn't fit my style.

294
00:16:45,219 --> 00:16:46,858
What's wrong with it?

295
00:16:46,961 --> 00:16:48,001
Let me rectify it for you.

296
00:16:48,104 --> 00:16:49,384
It's fine. Please give it to me.

297
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,079
It's not your fault. He's just hard to handle.

298
00:16:52,362 --> 00:16:53,582
Okay.

299
00:16:57,402 --> 00:16:58,722
Who said I was hard to handle?

300
00:16:58,831 --> 00:17:00,051
Let me trim your eyebrows.

301
00:17:01,162 --> 00:17:02,242
Here.

302
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:03,602
Don't!

303
00:17:03,761 --> 00:17:05,682
I...

304
00:17:05,771 --> 00:17:07,657
- You're not getting back at me, right? - Of course I'm not.

305
00:17:07,681 --> 00:17:09,542
- I'm your personal assistant. - Wait.

306
00:17:09,787 --> 00:17:11,922
I suddenly feel like my makeup is perfect.

307
00:17:12,003 --> 00:17:13,842
Look at my eyebrows. They look alive.

308
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,081
They look alive?

309
00:17:15,162 --> 00:17:16,882
- That's not your style. - No!

310
00:17:16,963 --> 00:17:18,443
It's totally my style.

311
00:17:19,051 --> 00:17:21,425
You've been standing for some time. Have a seat.

312
00:17:21,506 --> 00:17:22,741
- Are you giving up? - Lawyer Qian.

313
00:17:22,765 --> 00:17:24,504
The set is ready. Please follow me.

314
00:17:25,917 --> 00:17:27,137
Okay.

315
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:28,922
Don't fall behind.

316
00:17:29,145 --> 00:17:31,385
I can only show you total dominance.

317
00:17:31,872 --> 00:17:32,953
Cut!

318
00:17:33,042 --> 00:17:35,282
Lawyer Qian, you're such a pro.

319
00:17:35,369 --> 00:17:36,928
Change the camera position.

320
00:17:38,441 --> 00:17:40,521
How is it? Is it fun being a celebrity?

321
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,783
Of course. Was I cool just now?

322
00:17:45,322 --> 00:17:46,818
The shooting exceeded the estimated time by eight minutes.

323
00:17:46,842 --> 00:17:48,739
Talk to the director about the overtime fee.

324
00:17:48,843 --> 00:17:51,922
Enough already. The director went bankrupt from hiring you alone.

325
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,170
Stop joking around. Let's go.

326
00:17:53,282 --> 00:17:54,642
I was just joking with you.

327
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:57,671
Qian Heng,

328
00:17:58,521 --> 00:18:00,602
this time, I'll show you the real deal.

329
00:18:08,073 --> 00:18:10,793
(I might not be able to control myself when I defeat Deng Ming.)

330
00:18:10,905 --> 00:18:12,802
(I can only show you total dominance.)

331
00:18:15,035 --> 00:18:16,411
- Did you see that? - Play it again.

332
00:18:16,435 --> 00:18:17,976
- Play it again. - Yeah.

333
00:18:19,402 --> 00:18:22,242
(I might not be able to control myself when I defeat Deng Ming.)

334
00:18:22,322 --> 00:18:24,201
(I can only show you total dominance.)

335
00:18:26,347 --> 00:18:28,153
What are you guys laughing at? You guys look happy.

336
00:18:28,177 --> 00:18:30,397
- Total dominance! - What are you talking about?

337
00:18:31,642 --> 00:18:34,102
I can only show you

338
00:18:34,761 --> 00:18:36,257
- total dominance. - Total dominance!

339
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,362
Farewell.

340
00:18:37,485 --> 00:18:38,885
Wait!

341
00:18:39,013 --> 00:18:40,482
Total dominance. Don't leave yet.

342
00:18:42,681 --> 00:18:45,082
Our law firm became popular after he attended the show.

343
00:18:45,194 --> 00:18:46,414
Am I right?

344
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,922
Do you know what they're calling you right now?

345
00:18:50,098 --> 00:18:52,138
They're calling you Tony Leung of the law industry.

346
00:18:53,302 --> 00:18:54,364
We have to strike while the iron is hot.

347
00:18:54,388 --> 00:18:57,974
Let me contact that reporter friend of mine and arrange an interview.

348
00:18:58,055 --> 00:19:00,676
I must show your charisma to the world.

349
00:19:01,122 --> 00:19:02,966
Are you too free? Or do you think I'm too free?

350
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,912
I'm very busy. I'm going to be your manager.

351
00:19:04,993 --> 00:19:06,593
I have to deal with your business deals.

352
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:08,481
Manager, I wish to speak with my buddy...

353
00:19:08,562 --> 00:19:10,083
Sorry.

354
00:19:10,163 --> 00:19:11,201
He's busy.

355
00:19:11,281 --> 00:19:12,560
How long has he been like this?

356
00:19:12,641 --> 00:19:13,779
He's busy. Don't take photos of him.

357
00:19:13,803 --> 00:19:15,527
After he watched your promotional clip.

358
00:19:15,608 --> 00:19:17,902
Now, it's spreading from person to person.

359
00:19:21,001 --> 00:19:22,681
- Total dominance. - Total dominance.

360
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,020
Dominance.

361
00:19:24,281 --> 00:19:25,282
Did he turn like this?

362
00:19:25,385 --> 00:19:27,682
He's the seller. We're buying into it.

363
00:19:28,921 --> 00:19:30,257
Go and see a doctor if you're sick, okay?

364
00:19:30,281 --> 00:19:31,862
- Dismissed! - Wait! Don't go yet.

365
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:33,489
You should practice your signature.

366
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,003
Later, plenty of fans will ask for your signature.

367
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,681
Look at how crazy your fans are.

368
00:19:38,961 --> 00:19:41,202
I'll see your name on Hot Search later.

369
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:44,402
My partner is becoming a celebrity!

370
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:45,722
My goodness.

371
00:19:46,206 --> 00:19:47,761
- Stop messing around. - Let's take advantage of his popularity.

372
00:19:47,785 --> 00:19:49,105
His name is on Hot Search indeed.

373
00:19:49,162 --> 00:19:50,382
That quickly?

374
00:19:50,562 --> 00:19:52,722
I knew it. Your name is on Hot Search now, Tony Leung.

375
00:19:52,903 --> 00:19:54,299
- Your name is on Hot Search. - Total dominance.

376
00:19:54,323 --> 00:19:55,443
Whose name is on Hot Search?

377
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,442
Why is my name on it? I'm not on the show.

378
00:20:08,681 --> 00:20:10,441
I'll go and look for Cheng Xi.

379
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,562
- As for the law firm... - Lawyer Wu, I'm here.

380
00:20:12,643 --> 00:20:14,202
- Me too. - Me too.

381
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,900
Go now.

382
00:20:23,546 --> 00:20:29,042
(Qian Heng)

383
00:20:31,644 --> 00:20:32,864
What's on your mind?

384
00:20:36,262 --> 00:20:37,362
Don't worry.

385
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:39,242
He's done for.

386
00:20:41,138 --> 00:20:43,499
Deng Ming is just like a flea.

387
00:20:44,112 --> 00:20:46,792
He did this for so many years. He has no new tricks up his sleeves.

388
00:20:47,595 --> 00:20:49,042
If only I can beat him up

389
00:20:49,362 --> 00:20:51,202
or splash his house with paint.

390
00:20:51,882 --> 00:20:53,102
No.

391
00:20:53,469 --> 00:20:54,629
I should beat him up first.

392
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,967
After that, I'll splash his house with paint.

393
00:20:55,991 --> 00:20:58,162
I'll record the process and humiliate him.

394
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,521
How are you so cute?

395
00:21:00,671 --> 00:21:01,891
This isn't cute at all.

396
00:21:02,122 --> 00:21:03,579
He's bullying Cheng Xi. That means he's bullying you.

397
00:21:03,603 --> 00:21:05,042
That means he's bullying me.

398
00:21:05,122 --> 00:21:06,342
Don't worry.

399
00:21:06,423 --> 00:21:08,103
My sister and I aren't that weak.

400
00:21:11,721 --> 00:21:13,921
He failed so many times with the same trick.

401
00:21:14,048 --> 00:21:15,448
Even so, he's still using it.

402
00:21:16,322 --> 00:21:17,542
I assume he's out of tricks.

403
00:21:21,122 --> 00:21:23,042
By the way, how's Lawyer Wu?

404
00:21:24,162 --> 00:21:25,382
He's fine.

405
00:21:26,681 --> 00:21:29,181
He won't miss out on such a good sadfishing opportunity.

406
00:21:31,441 --> 00:21:32,762
I'll call Cheng Xi.

407
00:21:37,044 --> 00:21:38,939
- Thank you, Lawyer Cheng. - Don't mention it.

408
00:21:38,963 --> 00:21:41,202
Take care. Thank you.

409
00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:43,719
How did you know that I was just done with my meeting?

410
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,401
You came at the right time.

411
00:21:50,201 --> 00:21:52,322
You saw the news online?

412
00:21:52,496 --> 00:21:53,716
I did.

413
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,560
Don't worry about me.

414
00:21:55,721 --> 00:21:57,282
Nothing matters to me

415
00:21:57,795 --> 00:21:59,082
as long as you're by my side.

416
00:21:59,842 --> 00:22:01,601
I know. It's nothing major.

417
00:22:01,681 --> 00:22:02,961
I'm not worried about it at all.

418
00:22:04,891 --> 00:22:06,482
Just tell me if there's any issue.

419
00:22:07,209 --> 00:22:08,522
There's an issue now.

420
00:22:08,905 --> 00:22:11,186
You didn't give me the chance to answer Cheng Yao's call.

421
00:22:13,602 --> 00:22:14,802
Yao Yao.

422
00:22:14,944 --> 00:22:16,762
Did Wu Jun keep hanging up on Yao Yao?

423
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:18,922
(Cheng Xi, how are you?)

424
00:22:19,481 --> 00:22:20,701
I'm fine.

425
00:22:20,782 --> 00:22:22,922
I know what to do next.

426
00:22:24,001 --> 00:22:26,082
Deng Ming has been bullying me all these years.

427
00:22:26,602 --> 00:22:30,602
(I tolerated him because I was alone.)

428
00:22:30,761 --> 00:22:32,881
(I couldn't stop him myself.)

429
00:22:33,042 --> 00:22:34,722
(But now, I have you guys.)

430
00:22:35,802 --> 00:22:38,562
And, I have my beloved with me too.

431
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:40,935
This time, I won't let him off.

432
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:43,369
Don't worry. I won't be scared again.

433
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:45,040
We'll stand by you.

434
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,640
Don't worry about it.

435
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,056
I've already decided what to do.

436
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,961
I'll contact Bao Rui and Yu Fei and tell them to gather evidence.

437
00:22:51,042 --> 00:22:52,591
Tan Ying will deal with the media.

438
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,762
Qian, your mission is more difficult.

439
00:22:54,912 --> 00:22:56,751
Don't worry. This time,

440
00:22:57,015 --> 00:22:58,816
I'll expose his true colors entirely.

441
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:04,322
Yao Yao, I'm done.

442
00:23:04,642 --> 00:23:05,862
Let me see.

443
00:23:06,201 --> 00:23:07,842
- Do I look good? - Yeah.

444
00:23:08,241 --> 00:23:09,882
- Am I handsome? - Yeah.

445
00:23:10,721 --> 00:23:13,441
You're betting everything on me this time. Are you nervous?

446
00:23:13,521 --> 00:23:14,802
Of course not.

447
00:23:14,922 --> 00:23:16,522
My husband is invincible after all.

448
00:23:17,419 --> 00:23:18,639
What did you say just now?

449
00:23:19,201 --> 00:23:20,881
I said my husband is invincible after all.

450
00:23:21,042 --> 00:23:22,299
- Say it again. - We don't have time for that.

451
00:23:22,323 --> 00:23:23,721
Say that again seriously.

452
00:23:24,481 --> 00:23:26,802
Hello, everyone. Welcome to Lawyers' Debate.

453
00:23:26,883 --> 00:23:28,684
I'm your host for today.

454
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:33,042
We're very honored to be able to invite two outstanding lawyers to our set.

455
00:23:33,122 --> 00:23:36,482
They'll solve real cases from a professional view.

456
00:23:36,562 --> 00:23:38,002
First, let's welcome

457
00:23:38,082 --> 00:23:40,242
Deng Ming from Dewei & Co.

458
00:23:40,322 --> 00:23:41,542
Let's welcome him.

459
00:23:45,322 --> 00:23:47,641
Lawyer Deng, welcome. Please say hi to the audience.

460
00:23:47,856 --> 00:23:51,375
Hello, I'm everyone's professional lawyer

461
00:23:51,456 --> 00:23:53,097
and your friend, Deng Ming.

462
00:23:53,241 --> 00:23:55,201
Welcome, Deng Ming.

463
00:23:55,696 --> 00:23:57,416
At the same time, let's welcome

464
00:23:57,497 --> 00:23:59,802
Qian Heng from Junheng & Co.

465
00:23:59,882 --> 00:24:01,102
Let's welcome him.

466
00:24:05,441 --> 00:24:07,002
Lawyer Qian, welcome.

467
00:24:07,082 --> 00:24:08,282
Please say hi to the audience.

468
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:09,542
Lawyer Qian!

469
00:24:18,602 --> 00:24:20,699
Lawyer Qian doesn't make his appearance on such shows often.

470
00:24:20,723 --> 00:24:22,482
- That's why... - Although that's true,

471
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:24,882
I do make my appearance on the court often.

472
00:24:26,052 --> 00:24:28,522
That's right. We're old rivals and friends.

473
00:24:29,281 --> 00:24:32,082
It's fine. Lawyer Qian might be a little introverted.

474
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,790
Guys, please take your seats.

475
00:24:35,314 --> 00:24:37,600
The two parties involved today, which are Ms. Sun and Mr. Shi,

476
00:24:37,624 --> 00:24:39,457
had been in a relationship for five years. They were married for one year.

477
00:24:39,481 --> 00:24:41,922
Now, Ms. Sun insists on getting a divorce.

478
00:24:42,082 --> 00:24:44,138
Both of our lawyers will provide them with the best solution

479
00:24:44,162 --> 00:24:46,201
from a professional view.

480
00:24:47,449 --> 00:24:49,649
My relationship with him is already cracked.

481
00:24:49,761 --> 00:24:51,641
What do you mean by that?

482
00:24:51,842 --> 00:24:53,378
Both of us are each other's first love.

483
00:24:53,402 --> 00:24:55,362
What about the pleasant moments we had together?

484
00:24:55,511 --> 00:24:57,431
How could our relationship crack just like that?

485
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,242
Ms. Sun,

486
00:25:00,521 --> 00:25:02,562
can you tell us

487
00:25:02,643 --> 00:25:05,682
what caused the crack in your marriage?

488
00:25:07,802 --> 00:25:09,842
We didn't live together before we got married.

489
00:25:10,402 --> 00:25:12,403
- After we got married, I realized... - Enough.

490
00:25:12,484 --> 00:25:14,947
There were just small conflicts between us.

491
00:25:15,241 --> 00:25:16,881
It wasn't anything major at all.

492
00:25:28,241 --> 00:25:29,802
In this case,

493
00:25:30,376 --> 00:25:32,175
I choose to side with

494
00:25:33,441 --> 00:25:34,802
Mr. Shi.

495
00:25:35,481 --> 00:25:37,242
First, Ms. Sun,

496
00:25:37,322 --> 00:25:38,542
I have some advice for you.

497
00:25:38,642 --> 00:25:40,882
Marriage and love are different in nature.

498
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:44,641
Marriage is filled with trivial conflicts.

499
00:25:44,744 --> 00:25:47,244
So, how can we resolve those conflicts?

500
00:25:47,521 --> 00:25:51,242
We have to be more tolerating toward each other

501
00:25:51,322 --> 00:25:52,681
and try to understand each other.

502
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:54,881
This way, we can get to know each other better.

503
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,259
Am I right, Mr. Shi?

504
00:25:58,618 --> 00:25:59,838
Ms. Sun,

505
00:26:00,512 --> 00:26:03,562
has Mr. Shi committed any fundamental errors in the marriage?

506
00:26:03,642 --> 00:26:04,793
For example, committing adultery.

507
00:26:04,817 --> 00:26:06,037
No.

508
00:26:07,362 --> 00:26:09,401
He would never commit adultery.

509
00:26:20,681 --> 00:26:21,901
Ms. Sun,

510
00:26:22,882 --> 00:26:25,161
everyone has the right to express their demand.

511
00:26:25,521 --> 00:26:26,681
As your attorney,

512
00:26:26,807 --> 00:26:28,488
I'll stand by you resolutely

513
00:26:28,649 --> 00:26:30,362
and fight for the rights you deserve.

514
00:26:30,481 --> 00:26:31,824
Therefore, you can tell me about your demand bravely.

515
00:26:31,848 --> 00:26:33,068
There's no need to be afraid.

516
00:26:34,803 --> 00:26:36,443
I just want to divorce him.

517
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,642
- We... - Ms. Sun.

518
00:26:39,226 --> 00:26:41,243
It's like this. First, Mr. Shi didn't commit adultery.

519
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:43,106
Second, he doesn't have any bad habits.

520
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,840
The court finds it hard to support

521
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,602
your divorce request.

522
00:26:47,241 --> 00:26:48,461
Ms. Sun,

523
00:26:48,842 --> 00:26:50,962
have you two been leading a normal life?

524
00:26:51,465 --> 00:26:52,657
What are you trying to say here?

525
00:26:52,681 --> 00:26:54,155
What do you mean by that? Are you trying to malign me?

526
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:55,327
Mr. Shi, please don't do this.

527
00:26:55,351 --> 00:26:56,602
- But he... - Calm down.

528
00:26:56,723 --> 00:26:58,683
The recording is in progress. Please have a seat.

529
00:26:58,763 --> 00:26:59,983
Please sit down.

530
00:27:00,635 --> 00:27:01,855
Calm down.

531
00:27:03,146 --> 00:27:04,547
If my guess is correct,

532
00:27:05,481 --> 00:27:06,920
it's likely that Ms. Sun is requesting a divorce

533
00:27:06,944 --> 00:27:10,164
due to some hidden factors that she's not willing to divulge.

534
00:27:11,902 --> 00:27:14,018
- He hit the nail on the head. - Ms. Sun, it's fine.

535
00:27:14,042 --> 00:27:16,362
You don't need to be afraid. Don't feel ashamed.

536
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:19,522
You must trust the law. The law will protect everyone's basic rights.

537
00:27:19,913 --> 00:27:21,593
And, judging from what happened just now,

538
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:24,002
I suspect him of showing violent tendencies toward you.

539
00:27:27,298 --> 00:27:30,402
I thought we could face the situation together after discovering it.

540
00:27:30,626 --> 00:27:32,027
I even contacted a doctor

541
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,919
and wanted to send him for treatment.

542
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:36,219
In the end, he strongly opposed it.

543
00:27:36,361 --> 00:27:39,481
He insulted me and said that I was a wretch.

544
00:27:39,569 --> 00:27:40,888
He even hit me.

545
00:27:41,362 --> 00:27:44,362
Since then, I never dared to bring up the matter again.

546
00:27:44,882 --> 00:27:47,282
Even so, he still loses his temper all the time.

547
00:27:48,562 --> 00:27:50,139
I don't want to lead such a life anymore.

548
00:27:50,163 --> 00:27:52,784
- Shut up! I'll slap you! - Mr. Shi!

549
00:28:00,755 --> 00:28:02,355
Shameless woman, how could you say that?

550
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:03,601
Mr. Shi,

551
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:05,922
are you trying to threaten my client with violence?

552
00:28:06,067 --> 00:28:08,042
Ms. Sun's divorce request makes perfect sense.

553
00:28:08,296 --> 00:28:09,617
If you don't cooperate with us,

554
00:28:09,704 --> 00:28:11,344
we'll file a divorce lawsuit.

555
00:28:11,897 --> 00:28:14,362
You show obvious violent tendencies and abusive behavior.

556
00:28:14,738 --> 00:28:16,754
I'm sure you know what the court verdict will be.

557
00:28:16,835 --> 00:28:19,136
Lawyer Qian, you see,

558
00:28:20,046 --> 00:28:23,287
this is Mr. Shi's first time joining a show like this.

559
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:27,162
And, we talked about issues related to male dignity.

560
00:28:27,371 --> 00:28:28,962
He's a little nervous and agitated.

561
00:28:29,088 --> 00:28:30,304
His behaviors are understandable.

562
00:28:30,328 --> 00:28:31,362
Am I right?

563
00:28:33,013 --> 00:28:36,453
Fine. Mr. Shi, even if you do have such issues...

564
00:28:38,652 --> 00:28:40,773
Mr. Shi, have a seat first.

565
00:28:44,493 --> 00:28:47,213
Even if Mr. Shi does have such issues,

566
00:28:47,965 --> 00:28:50,602
it might not be his fault entirely.

567
00:28:50,882 --> 00:28:53,682
After all, it takes two to tango.

568
00:28:53,925 --> 00:28:58,205
It's likely that his wife is the cause of his issues.

569
00:28:58,739 --> 00:28:59,915
And, according to what I know,

570
00:28:59,939 --> 00:29:01,842
such occurrences are common too.

571
00:29:02,581 --> 00:29:03,801
Lawyer Qian.

572
00:29:05,795 --> 00:29:08,995
Their relationship lasted for a long time.

573
00:29:09,294 --> 00:29:12,162
You're suggesting them to get a divorce

574
00:29:12,497 --> 00:29:14,018
just because of his flaws?

575
00:29:14,864 --> 00:29:18,401
Don't you think you're being too irresponsible and childish here?

576
00:29:18,481 --> 00:29:19,641
Deng Ming,

577
00:29:19,752 --> 00:29:21,393
can you be a man for once?

578
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,721
Even now, you wish to push the blame on Ms. Sun?

579
00:29:23,921 --> 00:29:26,177
She already did everything she could, but you're still guilt-tripping her.

580
00:29:26,201 --> 00:29:28,921
You want her to waste her life in an unhealthy relationship as such.

581
00:29:29,192 --> 00:29:30,882
Some conflicts cannot be resolved.

582
00:29:31,882 --> 00:29:34,537
The domestic cases you take on may have the highest settlement rate,

583
00:29:34,561 --> 00:29:36,001
but have you calculated the ratio of

584
00:29:36,057 --> 00:29:39,977
reconciled marriages against broken relationships in the end?

585
00:29:40,401 --> 00:29:42,001
- Qian Heng, have you... - Deng Ming,

586
00:29:42,082 --> 00:29:44,002
a good marriage should be protected.

587
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:46,681
However, in a marriage where the wife gets abused,

588
00:29:46,761 --> 00:29:48,098
we should encourage the female party

589
00:29:48,122 --> 00:29:50,002
to protect herself and stop her loss in time.

590
00:29:50,162 --> 00:29:52,602
As a lawyer, you should do your part.

591
00:29:53,122 --> 00:29:55,697
Stop trying to persuade my client to make concessions to avoid trouble.

592
00:29:55,721 --> 00:29:57,441
Now, you should think about

593
00:29:57,521 --> 00:30:00,642
how to fight for your client's best interest during the trial.

594
00:30:00,723 --> 00:30:01,963
There's no need for that.

595
00:30:02,961 --> 00:30:04,721
They have a long-lasting relationship.

596
00:30:04,961 --> 00:30:06,201
They won't get a divorce.

597
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:08,519
You don't get to say whether they get a divorce or not.

598
00:30:12,921 --> 00:30:15,962
My goodness. Lawyer Qian is so cool.

599
00:30:16,042 --> 00:30:17,401
Deng Meng is no match for him.

600
00:30:17,481 --> 00:30:19,681
Precisely. What was he saying?

601
00:30:19,761 --> 00:30:21,642
He actually tried to force a mediation.

602
00:30:21,721 --> 00:30:23,082
He's out of his mind.

603
00:30:23,162 --> 00:30:24,322
Precisely.

604
00:30:24,402 --> 00:30:25,722
Lawyer Qian is right.

605
00:30:25,802 --> 00:30:26,962
Lawyer Qian, excellent words!

606
00:30:27,042 --> 00:30:29,401
- Yeah! - Lawyer Qian is right!

607
00:30:29,481 --> 00:30:30,701
You can do it!

608
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:34,082
- He was so cool. - All right, thank you.

609
00:30:34,163 --> 00:30:36,241
Let's thank Lawyer Qian for his amazing defense.

610
00:30:36,322 --> 00:30:38,522
Let's thank Lawyer Deng too. Thank you.

611
00:30:38,602 --> 00:30:40,762
- Now, we'll take a short break. - Wait.

612
00:30:41,416 --> 00:30:42,775
Just now,

613
00:30:42,871 --> 00:30:46,831
Lawyer Cheng Xi posted an announcement on her social media.

614
00:30:53,046 --> 00:30:55,367
(Hello, everyone. I'm Cheng Xi.)

615
00:30:55,595 --> 00:30:57,082
(I'm Deng Ming's ex-wife.)

616
00:30:57,927 --> 00:31:00,727
(There are many false rumors about me online.)

617
00:31:00,979 --> 00:31:01,979
(Today, )

618
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,159
(I shall answer all of them.)

619
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:06,682
(Deng Ming committed adultery.)

620
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:09,998
(After that, he fabricated rumors of me committing adultery.)

621
00:31:10,184 --> 00:31:11,404
(That's the first fact.)

622
00:31:12,201 --> 00:31:13,842
(After we got a divorce, )

623
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,030
(he kept harassing me.)

624
00:31:16,294 --> 00:31:19,562
(He blackmailed me with my family and forced me to be his secret lover.)

625
00:31:19,721 --> 00:31:20,941
(That's the second fact.)

626
00:31:22,689 --> 00:31:23,842
(After Deng Ming failed, )

627
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:26,522
(he slandered my current boyfriend, Wu Jun, on purpose.)

628
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:28,972
(He even resorted to dirty tricks)

629
00:31:29,068 --> 00:31:30,507
(to compete with Junheng & Co.)

630
00:31:31,327 --> 00:31:33,168
(He colluded with crooks)

631
00:31:33,322 --> 00:31:34,858
(to beat up the plaintiff and forge fake evidence.)

632
00:31:34,882 --> 00:31:36,102
(That's the third fact.)

633
00:31:36,642 --> 00:31:38,161
(As a law practitioner, )

634
00:31:38,961 --> 00:31:41,401
(I cannot tolerate Deng Ming)

635
00:31:41,496 --> 00:31:43,676
(for standing above the law for his own interests.)

636
00:31:46,991 --> 00:31:49,152
(I'm accountable for what I said in this clip.)

637
00:31:49,444 --> 00:31:51,564
(And, I have evidence to prove it.)

638
00:31:51,992 --> 00:31:54,672
(Related departments can verify them anytime.)

639
00:31:56,731 --> 00:31:58,762
That's slander!

640
00:31:58,889 --> 00:32:00,688
Listen! That's fake!

641
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:02,642
Leave!

642
00:32:03,647 --> 00:32:06,206
- Leave the stage! - Yeah! You were getting on my nerves!

643
00:32:07,804 --> 00:32:09,402
Leave the stage!

644
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:11,961
Just you wait.

645
00:32:14,201 --> 00:32:15,562
Leave the stage!

646
00:32:31,402 --> 00:32:32,802
I have to say something about that.

647
00:32:32,999 --> 00:32:34,640
That was truly satisfying.

648
00:32:35,082 --> 00:32:37,121
And, Cheng Xi revealed the truth.

649
00:32:37,201 --> 00:32:38,442
I'm happy for her.

650
00:32:38,562 --> 00:32:39,681
She's very brave.

651
00:32:39,761 --> 00:32:41,762
You two will celebrate this alone, right?

652
00:32:41,842 --> 00:32:43,202
If so, we won't interrupt you two.

653
00:32:44,681 --> 00:32:46,417
Actually, there's nothing for us to celebrate.

654
00:32:46,441 --> 00:32:48,540
You guys can go. I'll keep her company.

655
00:32:49,322 --> 00:32:51,862
- I can stay and keep her company. - Come on.

656
00:32:54,162 --> 00:32:55,401
- He's here. - Lawyer Qian.

657
00:32:55,481 --> 00:32:56,802
Lawyer Qian.

658
00:32:56,882 --> 00:32:58,869
Many netizens said you were the tumor of the law industry.

659
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:00,189
You never cared to explain yourself.

660
00:33:00,213 --> 00:33:02,477
Why are you willing to make an appearance on this show

661
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:05,362
and expose the true colors of certain lawyers in public?

662
00:33:08,001 --> 00:33:10,202
In the past, I felt the same as you guys.

663
00:33:10,439 --> 00:33:11,919
I didn't care about any false rumors.

664
00:33:11,983 --> 00:33:13,303
No matter how people insulted me,

665
00:33:13,346 --> 00:33:14,722
it wouldn't affect my sales.

666
00:33:14,802 --> 00:33:16,121
It wouldn't affect my work too.

667
00:33:16,552 --> 00:33:19,893
There was no need to explain myself to people with no legal knowledge.

668
00:33:20,921 --> 00:33:22,082
But after that,

669
00:33:22,221 --> 00:33:24,042
someone changed how I thought.

670
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:25,482
She told me

671
00:33:25,612 --> 00:33:28,482
that a lawyer should be more than just responsible for their clients

672
00:33:28,577 --> 00:33:29,976
and their work.

673
00:33:30,162 --> 00:33:32,497
A lawyer also has the responsibility to spread faith in the law.

674
00:33:32,521 --> 00:33:35,921
Lawyer Qian, who was the one who changed your thoughts?

675
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,200
Is that person the most important person in your life?

676
00:33:41,761 --> 00:33:42,981
Yes.

677
00:33:44,633 --> 00:33:46,325
Actually, I thought about it for a long time.

678
00:33:46,349 --> 00:33:48,602
But now, I have to admit that she's right.

679
00:33:50,424 --> 00:33:52,304
We sculpt our own image.

680
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:55,162
We should also spread faith in the law with our actions.

681
00:33:55,768 --> 00:33:57,641
I respect my occupation, the law,

682
00:33:57,721 --> 00:33:59,002
and have faith in the law too.

683
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:02,198
I wish to correct the misconceptions people have toward law and lawyers.

684
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:04,762
That's why I have to act.

685
00:34:05,822 --> 00:34:07,782
At the same time, I believe in the media's power.

686
00:34:07,841 --> 00:34:10,681
I believe one of the valuable points about media is to reveal the truth

687
00:34:10,737 --> 00:34:12,281
instead of becoming a weapon of crime.

688
00:34:12,431 --> 00:34:14,978
The cooperation between the legal industry and the media industry

689
00:34:15,002 --> 00:34:16,842
will surely benefit the masses.

690
00:34:17,043 --> 00:34:18,082
Thank you, Lawyer Qian.

691
00:34:18,168 --> 00:34:21,008
Lawyer Qian, since you intend to help the masses with this cooperation,

692
00:34:21,065 --> 00:34:24,225
- do you intend to participate in... - Sorry. That's all for today.

693
00:34:24,306 --> 00:34:26,642
- Thank you. - Lawyer Qian, please answer us.

694
00:34:28,241 --> 00:34:30,561
That was satisfying. I wanted to do that for a long time.

695
00:34:31,962 --> 00:34:33,861
That was so satisfying. If only I could do it again.

696
00:34:33,885 --> 00:34:36,608
You should've told me earlier. I'll put Deng Ming's photo on a target.

697
00:34:36,632 --> 00:34:38,913
You can do target practice on him at any time of the day.

698
00:35:41,758 --> 00:35:43,681
You have to pay copyright fees

699
00:35:43,769 --> 00:35:46,089
for using other people's statements without changing them.

700
00:35:46,576 --> 00:35:47,896
I've already written something...

701
00:35:48,152 --> 00:35:49,592
I mean, I found a way to pay for it.

702
00:35:50,841 --> 00:35:52,061
Give me a moment.

703
00:35:55,841 --> 00:35:57,061
Cheng Yao,

704
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,824
I thought I wouldn't get married for the rest of my life,

705
00:35:59,848 --> 00:36:01,088
until I met you.

706
00:36:02,082 --> 00:36:04,082
You're my every right and responsibility.

707
00:36:04,344 --> 00:36:06,665
You're the only irresistible force in my world.

708
00:36:07,201 --> 00:36:08,421
Facing you,

709
00:36:08,642 --> 00:36:09,881
I have no chance of winning.

710
00:36:14,602 --> 00:36:15,881
Is it too...

711
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:18,682
Actually, I just want to tell you

712
00:36:18,922 --> 00:36:20,912
that I wish to spend the rest of my days with you.

713
00:36:20,936 --> 00:36:23,496
I want to be the most important person in your life.

714
00:36:30,794 --> 00:36:32,014
Cheng Yao,

715
00:36:33,962 --> 00:36:35,762
I hereby stand at the humblest position,

716
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:39,385
using the right to control my time as my bargaining chip, I beg you

717
00:36:40,577 --> 00:36:42,257
to be the partner of my life.

718
00:40:39,201 --> 00:40:42,081
Cheng Xiao He, you don't have parents. You're an orphan.

719
00:40:42,162 --> 00:40:44,241
Cheng Xiao He is an orphan.

720
00:40:44,321 --> 00:40:45,761
Orphans refer to minors

721
00:40:45,841 --> 00:40:49,921
under the age of 18 who have lost or unable to locate their parents.

722
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,560
I have biological parents.

723
00:40:51,641 --> 00:40:53,842
- Therefore, I'm not an orphan. - You're an orphan.

724
00:40:53,922 --> 00:40:55,801
Your parents are not married.

725
00:40:55,881 --> 00:40:58,442
I don't know if my parents are married or not.

726
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:02,562
But I'm sure I'm not an orphan even if I was born outside of marriage.

727
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:04,198
You nerd.

728
00:41:04,279 --> 00:41:05,800
We don't want to play with you.

729
00:41:09,922 --> 00:41:11,522
Give me the book.

730
00:41:12,422 --> 00:41:13,441
According to Article 2

731
00:41:13,522 --> 00:41:14,578
of the Public Security Administration Punishment Law,

732
00:41:14,602 --> 00:41:16,458
for those who infringe on personal and property rights,

733
00:41:16,482 --> 00:41:17,641
according to the provisions

734
00:41:17,721 --> 00:41:19,777
of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China,

735
00:41:19,801 --> 00:41:21,458
are to be pursued for criminal responsibility in accordance with law;

736
00:41:21,482 --> 00:41:23,138
where such acts are not serious enough for criminal punishment,

737
00:41:23,162 --> 00:41:24,838
the public security organs shall impose

738
00:41:24,919 --> 00:41:26,377
public security administration punishments in accordance with this Law.

739
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:27,697
You guys stole Cheng Xiao He's book.

740
00:41:27,721 --> 00:41:30,241
That means you infringed on his property rights, understood?

741
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,802
I memorized that article.

742
00:41:31,962 --> 00:41:33,642
Where persons who are not yet 14 years old

743
00:41:33,721 --> 00:41:36,562
violate public security administration, they are not punished,

744
00:41:36,642 --> 00:41:40,294
but their guardians shall be instructed to more strictly control them.

745
00:41:40,402 --> 00:41:42,202
What does "guardians" mean?

746
00:41:42,672 --> 00:41:44,111
It means parents.

747
00:41:44,363 --> 00:41:47,242
To put it simply, I'm going to call your parents.

748
00:41:51,325 --> 00:41:52,401
Sorry, miss.

749
00:41:52,482 --> 00:41:54,602
I forgot to tell my husband that the kids

750
00:41:54,693 --> 00:41:56,242
were rehearsing for a law play.

751
00:41:56,642 --> 00:41:58,961
Both of Xiao He's parents are lawyers.

752
00:41:59,042 --> 00:42:02,362
I can understand why he wants to play a role here.

753
00:42:02,841 --> 00:42:05,041
But this is a kindergarten after all.

754
00:42:05,201 --> 00:42:06,681
The imagination of a child

755
00:42:06,761 --> 00:42:08,922
might not be as creative as you think.

756
00:42:09,122 --> 00:42:11,392
It's hard to achieve the effect that Xiao He wishes to achieve.

757
00:42:11,416 --> 00:42:14,616
No problem. We'll discuss it and see if there's another way to present it.

758
00:42:21,901 --> 00:42:23,722
Why did you scare the kids just now?

759
00:42:26,278 --> 00:42:28,238
We must educate the public about law since young.

760
00:42:28,886 --> 00:42:31,427
Isn't it good to educate them starting from kindergarten?

761
00:42:31,602 --> 00:42:32,851
Cheng Xiao He,

762
00:42:33,002 --> 00:42:34,692
your parents had been married for a long time,

763
00:42:34,716 --> 00:42:36,737
yet you were rehearsing for such a play behind their backs.

764
00:42:36,761 --> 00:42:38,098
Did you write the script yourself?

765
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:40,842
Who told them to go on a trip and leave me behind?

766
00:42:40,922 --> 00:42:43,922
But Dad told me to learn more from you, Uncle.

767
00:42:44,002 --> 00:42:46,182
I'll be a better lawyer than you

768
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:49,082
once I memorize all of the articles.

769
00:42:49,893 --> 00:42:51,613
That's just your father's wishful thinking.

770
00:42:51,662 --> 00:42:54,402
Aunt, when will you get married to Uncle?

771
00:42:54,751 --> 00:42:57,153
There are plenty of things we need to do before getting married.

772
00:42:57,177 --> 00:42:58,777
We need to book wedding dresses, a hotel,

773
00:42:58,801 --> 00:43:00,030
and invite guests to our wedding.

774
00:43:00,054 --> 00:43:01,974
Your uncle makes 10,000 yuan per hour, you know?

775
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,341
He doesn't have time for that.

776
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:06,402
I'm sure it's because Uncle is incompetent.

777
00:43:06,434 --> 00:43:08,206
But you like him anyway.

778
00:43:08,287 --> 00:43:10,018
That's why you aren't willing to get married.

779
00:43:10,042 --> 00:43:11,262
You brat.

780
00:43:12,637 --> 00:43:14,761
I've proposed to her many times.

781
00:43:14,841 --> 00:43:18,122
She's too busy trying to get promoted. She has no time for me.

782
00:43:18,203 --> 00:43:19,245
That's not true.

783
00:43:19,326 --> 00:43:21,889
I'm sure it's because Aunt held a grudge against you

784
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:23,490
for refusing to marry her before this.

785
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:25,310
That's why she doesn't want to get married.

786
00:43:25,961 --> 00:43:27,962
Why don't we hold a wedding today?

787
00:43:28,299 --> 00:43:30,539
We already have a ring bearer here. We can do it easily.

788
00:43:30,909 --> 00:43:33,149
Today? Stop joking around.

789
00:43:33,442 --> 00:43:36,961
It'll take a century to prepare for the wedding you dream of.

790
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:39,442
All right.

791
00:43:41,622 --> 00:43:44,042
- What are you doing? - Stop in front.

792
00:43:51,825 --> 00:43:54,362
- Here comes the car. - Here comes the car.

793
00:43:57,278 --> 00:43:59,479
Yao Yao, what do you mean by this?

794
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:01,739
You called me to head to the kindergarten

795
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:03,784
and direct Xiao He's play so that you could lure me out?

796
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:06,528
I can't just let this brat who loves to memorize law articles

797
00:44:06,911 --> 00:44:08,631
ask me about why I'm not married every day.

798
00:44:09,006 --> 00:44:12,349
Aunt, I've already memorized plenty of law articles.

799
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:15,082
I'm an adult now. I don't want to be a ring bearer.

800
00:44:15,162 --> 00:44:16,880
Can I be your groomsman?

801
00:44:16,961 --> 00:44:20,123
Brat, we already have a groomsman.

802
00:44:20,583 --> 00:44:21,803
Let's go.

803
00:44:21,998 --> 00:44:23,439
Boss, mind your head.

804
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:34,560
Let's get married.

805
00:44:41,319 --> 00:44:43,482
Sure. Let's get married today.
