1
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:38,962
(My Boss)

2
00:01:40,275 --> 00:01:42,827
(Episode 2: I'll give you a chance. Join the case.)

3
00:01:44,168 --> 00:01:47,027
(I know my effort will be seen by my boss!)

4
00:01:58,981 --> 00:02:00,562
(Storeroom)

5
00:02:02,429 --> 00:02:04,802
(Surely, there won't be anyone coming here, right?)

6
00:02:13,272 --> 00:02:14,942
There's even camping equipment.

7
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:18,482
I guess I have no choice

8
00:02:18,561 --> 00:02:20,271
but to camp in the firm for a few days.

9
00:02:46,105 --> 00:02:47,245
Oh my god.

10
00:02:48,339 --> 00:02:50,162
This person must be so toxic

11
00:02:50,801 --> 00:02:52,990
to be so hated by everyone.

12
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:55,970
Scary.

13
00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:20,922
Out of sight, out of mind.

14
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,370
(Qian.)

15
00:03:53,451 --> 00:03:55,010
(Have a good dream tonight too.)

16
00:03:55,091 --> 00:03:57,559
(Don't forget your appointment with the psychologist tomorrow.)

17
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,162
(Wish you a speedy recovery.)

18
00:05:17,165 --> 00:05:19,290
If you don't withdraw the lawsuit, I'll kill you!

19
00:05:19,688 --> 00:05:21,120
Don't look for me. Look for Qian Heng.

20
00:05:21,144 --> 00:05:24,562
I'll kill his assistant first to sharpen my knife.

21
00:05:29,782 --> 00:05:30,842
Oh, this is scary.

22
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,202
This is scary.

23
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:37,979
It must be this urn.

24
00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:41,109
How did it come to this? I'm sleeping with an urn now.

25
00:05:56,755 --> 00:05:58,064
Is there still someone here?

26
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,610
Qian Heng.

27
00:06:01,098 --> 00:06:04,018
(Wait. Why does this person come to the firm in the middle of the night?)

28
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,381
(If I'm discovered, I'm dead.)

29
00:07:06,547 --> 00:07:08,002
(He's so harsh.)

30
00:07:09,281 --> 00:07:10,293
(No way.)

31
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,922
(I can't be controlled by my boss.)

32
00:07:12,109 --> 00:07:13,473
(I must work seriously during work hours)

33
00:07:13,497 --> 00:07:15,042
(and sleep seriously after work.)

34
00:07:15,138 --> 00:07:17,362
(I must be a good youth who is healthy and positive.)

35
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:19,376
Sleep.

36
00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:24,042
Sleep is good.

37
00:07:42,201 --> 00:07:44,450
(It's hard to make an appointment with this psychologist.)

38
00:07:44,474 --> 00:07:47,194
(I took his divorce case for you. That's why I could cut the queue.)

39
00:07:49,285 --> 00:07:51,155
(He doesn't look very professional.)

40
00:07:52,502 --> 00:07:55,362
(Control your temper and show respect to him.)

41
00:07:55,469 --> 00:07:58,255
(Otherwise, I'll tell all the clients about your insomnia.)

42
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,068
(When they question your mental state and change lawyer, )

43
00:08:01,156 --> 00:08:02,336
(I won't be responsible.)

44
00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:08,502
The foreign theology is not connected to the domestic one.

45
00:08:08,596 --> 00:08:10,179
In fact, it's not really useful.

46
00:08:10,671 --> 00:08:12,220
We should still believe in science.

47
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:13,802
We must not be idealistic.

48
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,859
Right. Everything you said is right.

49
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:17,263
Right?

50
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,242
I also heard Lawyer Wu say

51
00:08:19,447 --> 00:08:21,002
that your firm has not obtained

52
00:08:21,127 --> 00:08:24,460
the Golden Scale Award for many years.

53
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:26,322
It must be because of your obsession

54
00:08:26,387 --> 00:08:27,882
that caused too much pressure,

55
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,270
leading to insomnia in the end.

56
00:08:29,869 --> 00:08:31,739
My abilities are already top of the industry.

57
00:08:32,072 --> 00:08:33,870
I don't need any awards to recognize them.

58
00:08:34,018 --> 00:08:36,571
Rather, the Golden Scale Award didn't get my recognition.

59
00:08:37,247 --> 00:08:38,486
Isn't this award

60
00:08:38,629 --> 00:08:40,682
the highest honor in your industry?

61
00:08:41,205 --> 00:08:45,379
If you can't get it, how can you prove that you are the best lawyer?

62
00:08:45,573 --> 00:08:46,753
I'm kind-hearted.

63
00:08:46,908 --> 00:08:49,242
I pushed cases worth millions and took yours.

64
00:08:49,323 --> 00:08:50,343
Isn't that enough?

65
00:09:00,244 --> 00:09:01,764
- Bao, good morning. - Good morning.

66
00:09:02,706 --> 00:09:03,727
Bao, good morning.

67
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,020
Good morning.

68
00:09:05,374 --> 00:09:06,642
Good morning.

69
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,802
You all came pretty early.

70
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,299
Cheng Yao. What's wrong? Your face looks pale, just like a ghost.

71
00:09:15,702 --> 00:09:17,522
I didn't sleep well last night.

72
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:20,402
Cheng Yao. Relax.

73
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,525
It's normal to get eliminated at Junheng.

74
00:09:27,586 --> 00:09:28,606
Yu Fei,

75
00:09:29,109 --> 00:09:30,994
what are you busy with so early in the morning?

76
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:34,301
The case in the United States. The documents have been faxed over.

77
00:09:35,439 --> 00:09:37,556
The other side has agreed to sign the settlement agreement.

78
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,565
Lawyer Qian solved it during the phone conference last night.

79
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:40,749
He has written the documents.

80
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:43,069
I have to hurry and proofread them before he comes back.

81
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,521
You're incredibly fast!

82
00:09:46,104 --> 00:09:47,284
No way.

83
00:09:48,229 --> 00:09:50,136
How did this case get assigned to you instead of me?

84
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,762
"Relax. It's normal to get eliminated at Junheng."

85
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,909
How could that be?

86
00:09:56,055 --> 00:09:57,474
I'm Junheng's heir apparent.

87
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,362
I think you're getting really confused.

88
00:10:01,604 --> 00:10:04,483
I've always heard that the boss is very strict with his assistants.

89
00:10:04,564 --> 00:10:06,524
I didn't expect him to be so strict with himself.

90
00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:08,282
That's Lawyer Qian's style.

91
00:10:08,363 --> 00:10:10,775
Things that can be solved in one day will be solved in one day.

92
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:12,629
Every time he goes to battle, everyone suffers.

93
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,192
Lawyer Qian would rather compete to death

94
00:10:14,216 --> 00:10:15,522
than seeing you all demotivated.

95
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:17,616
But, does he not need to sleep?

96
00:10:18,377 --> 00:10:19,913
Only those with low efficiency stay up late.

97
00:10:19,937 --> 00:10:21,002
It's an effort in vain.

98
00:10:24,171 --> 00:10:25,171
Boss.

99
00:10:26,177 --> 00:10:29,162
You're here. Although this time the task wasn't given to me,

100
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:32,412
I guarantee I will assist Yu Fei in completing the proofreading job.

101
00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:34,232
Actually, as the founder,

102
00:10:34,313 --> 00:10:36,432
you don't have to work so hard, right?

103
00:10:38,499 --> 00:10:39,640
Take care of yourself.

104
00:10:39,749 --> 00:10:40,870
Did you get enough sleep?

105
00:10:40,981 --> 00:10:42,290
What are you trying to say?

106
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,233
Actually, nothing.

107
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,260
Boss,

108
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,412
I heard you move to a new house. Is it okay living there?

109
00:10:49,591 --> 00:10:51,991
It's okay. It's just that the neighbor is not very sensible.

110
00:10:52,713 --> 00:10:53,834
Not only is she noisy,

111
00:10:53,977 --> 00:10:55,286
she also breaks things.

112
00:10:56,724 --> 00:10:58,762
How can that be? Tell me the address.

113
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:01,460
- I'll complain to the management and make her move out. - She's gone.

114
00:11:01,484 --> 00:11:02,484
Out of my way.

115
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,922
Isn't he living in a detached villa?

116
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:08,304
How can there be neighbors?

117
00:11:13,868 --> 00:11:14,868
Hello.

118
00:11:17,685 --> 00:11:18,745
Tan Ying.

119
00:11:18,927 --> 00:11:21,482
Do I look better now?

120
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:23,870
Not bad. The dark circles look

121
00:11:23,972 --> 00:11:25,692
quite like someone from Lawyer Qian's team.

122
00:11:43,224 --> 00:11:44,700
Is it any better this way?

123
00:11:45,195 --> 00:11:46,482
Will it be too red?

124
00:11:47,865 --> 00:11:48,919
Don't worry.

125
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,481
From what I know of your boss,

126
00:11:50,562 --> 00:11:53,421
he can't distinguish lipstick colors at all.

127
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,310
All right.

128
00:12:10,317 --> 00:12:13,157
Being later than the boss to the meeting room is considered being late.

129
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,889
He's talking about you.

130
00:12:23,482 --> 00:12:25,490
Regarding a couple, the man has a business.

131
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:28,362
After they got married for half a year, they divorced.

132
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,402
Due to the prenuptial agreement,

133
00:12:30,566 --> 00:12:33,373
the property she got from the divorce wasn't much. But now,

134
00:12:33,454 --> 00:12:36,130
she found out the man's company was about to get financing and go public.

135
00:12:36,154 --> 00:12:37,925
She believes the man committed fraud

136
00:12:38,006 --> 00:12:40,470
and withheld information during their divorce.

137
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:44,362
So, she hopes that we can investigate and get her more property.

138
00:12:44,552 --> 00:12:48,190
As usual, I will take an assistant lawyer to work on this case.

139
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:50,870
Yu Fei has another case to handle now.

140
00:12:51,068 --> 00:12:53,809
So, this case, Bao Rui and Cheng Yao, you two compete for it.

141
00:12:54,045 --> 00:12:56,525
I will choose one of you to follow up on this case in the end.

142
00:12:56,825 --> 00:12:58,222
Time is very important for this case.

143
00:12:58,246 --> 00:13:01,645
After the divorce, the claim to re-divide the property has a time limit.

144
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:04,107
- How long have they been divorced? - Two years and ten months.

145
00:13:04,131 --> 00:13:06,131
So, it's still within the statute of limitations.

146
00:13:06,212 --> 00:13:08,252
If one spouse hides, transfers, sells off,

147
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,732
destroys common property

148
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,183
or forges debts, or attempts to misappropriate property,

149
00:13:12,264 --> 00:13:13,440
and the other spouse discovers it

150
00:13:13,464 --> 00:13:15,386
and provides clues about the property within three years,

151
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,775
he or she can sue in court

152
00:13:16,856 --> 00:13:19,540
to initiate post-divorce property disputes.

153
00:13:19,856 --> 00:13:22,932
Since this man has a business, the case is very simple.

154
00:13:23,013 --> 00:13:24,375
Start the investigation with his business.

155
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,033
Before the divorce, did he establish subsidiaries

156
00:13:26,057 --> 00:13:27,339
with his company as a shareholder?

157
00:13:27,363 --> 00:13:30,389
If so, have these companies increased their capital?

158
00:13:30,469 --> 00:13:33,099
Once these actions are taken, we can sue him for money.

159
00:13:34,268 --> 00:13:35,989
Is this company going to be listed now?

160
00:13:37,332 --> 00:13:39,315
If that's the case, the valuation won't be the same.

161
00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:40,729
If this case succeeds,

162
00:13:41,883 --> 00:13:43,683
the down payment for my house will be ready.

163
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,628
The investigation and evidence collection time is a bit short.

164
00:13:46,652 --> 00:13:48,652
We have to complete the lawsuit within two months.

165
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,220
Yes.

166
00:13:51,524 --> 00:13:52,602
Anything else?

167
00:13:56,882 --> 00:13:59,922
Cheng Yao. I asked you to come to the meeting, not to be a stenographer.

168
00:14:02,468 --> 00:14:06,230
Yu Fei and Bao's points are already comprehensive and detailed.

169
00:14:06,427 --> 00:14:08,777
So, you have no contribution whatsoever, right?

170
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:13,602
Do you usually spend your time on makeup and dressing up?

171
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:18,830
No. I just wanted to make myself look more energetic and professional.

172
00:14:19,062 --> 00:14:21,352
You use appearances to cover up the fact that you're not a good lawyer.

173
00:14:21,376 --> 00:14:23,722
Is this your understanding of the legal profession?

174
00:14:24,806 --> 00:14:26,767
Got it. I won't do it again. Sorry.

175
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:31,940
Okay. If you're still like this in the next month, please leave Junheng.

176
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,250
Got scolded?

177
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,149
Don't be sad. It's not all your fault.

178
00:15:04,546 --> 00:15:06,895
What can I do for everyone?

179
00:15:09,869 --> 00:15:12,180
Never mind. In case there's a handover later.

180
00:15:14,842 --> 00:15:16,513
Yu Fei, why do you talk like this?

181
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,310
Cheng Yao, don't worry.

182
00:15:20,468 --> 00:15:21,829
Even if you only stay for one day,

183
00:15:21,957 --> 00:15:23,387
I will still look after you.

184
00:15:25,565 --> 00:15:27,045
Who asked me to be the heir apparent?

185
00:15:27,348 --> 00:15:29,442
My master's awareness is really strong.

186
00:15:36,014 --> 00:15:37,042
(Let's make a bet.)

187
00:15:37,347 --> 00:15:39,096
(How long will this one stay?)

188
00:15:41,428 --> 00:15:43,307
(Bao Rui, don't get too carried away.)

189
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,562
(It's easy to leave a stain on your career this way.)

190
00:15:47,796 --> 00:15:50,242
(I'm just confident about the boss's "care.")

191
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,602
(I always feel that Cheng Yao is a bit special.)

192
00:16:01,134 --> 00:16:02,134
(Why?)

193
00:16:02,989 --> 00:16:05,459
(The assistant who couldn't answer the boss's question last time)

194
00:16:05,483 --> 00:16:07,082
(left on the spot.)

195
00:16:30,726 --> 00:16:32,110
Now, this will affect

196
00:16:32,195 --> 00:16:34,562
the tax treatment under U.S. tax law.

197
00:16:34,734 --> 00:16:37,350
We'd better get their confirmation

198
00:16:37,461 --> 00:16:39,442
before replying to the client.

199
00:16:41,954 --> 00:16:43,344
Is it time for work?

200
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,340
It's just five o'clock. Who is this?

201
00:17:00,606 --> 00:17:02,436
Sure. As soon as possible.

202
00:17:02,549 --> 00:17:03,722
Okay, bye.

203
00:17:09,366 --> 00:17:10,666
What are you doing here?

204
00:17:16,177 --> 00:17:17,442
Good morning, boss.

205
00:17:17,914 --> 00:17:20,162
I came to work.

206
00:17:20,343 --> 00:17:21,463
I just went to the restroom.

207
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:23,562
When I came back, I found you here too.

208
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:27,282
You came to work at 5:30?

209
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,670
The stupid bird should fly first.

210
00:17:30,989 --> 00:17:31,989
Boss.

211
00:17:32,178 --> 00:17:33,928
Your dark circles are so heavy.

212
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,229
Did you work an all-nighter?

213
00:17:37,309 --> 00:17:38,369
I just got here too.

214
00:17:40,431 --> 00:17:43,299
The stupid bird I just mentioned is me.

215
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:48,890
I thought bosses just had to snap their fingers to make us go to work.

216
00:17:49,015 --> 00:17:50,962
I'm surprised that you're working so hard, boss.

217
00:17:54,814 --> 00:17:56,002
You're making coffee?

218
00:17:56,336 --> 00:17:59,092
Let me make it for you. You can go to the office and take a break.

219
00:17:59,173 --> 00:18:00,962
No need. You should fly first.

220
00:18:32,438 --> 00:18:33,948
Glad I wasn't discovered.

221
00:18:48,223 --> 00:18:49,223
Boss.

222
00:18:50,434 --> 00:18:51,642
Boss.

223
00:18:51,989 --> 00:18:54,614
Ever since I heard your heroic story of outsmarting the intimidator,

224
00:18:54,638 --> 00:18:56,877
I come here to study before work every day.

225
00:18:57,111 --> 00:18:58,337
I try to be influenced by you

226
00:18:58,455 --> 00:19:00,860
and strive to be a good lawyer.

227
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:06,888
The sun is really strong outside.

228
00:19:10,756 --> 00:19:12,016
I'm going to work.

229
00:19:23,623 --> 00:19:24,842
Oh no.

230
00:19:25,481 --> 00:19:28,774
- Oh no. - You've been saying "Oh no" all morning. What's wrong?

231
00:19:28,923 --> 00:19:30,042
The boss went crazy.

232
00:19:30,221 --> 00:19:32,166
I didn't sleep all night to revise the documents.

233
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,670
If I keep doing this, I'll be dead.

234
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,202
Why did I have to be born in the Ox year?

235
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,640
I'm stuck working overtime for life like a cow or horse.

236
00:19:38,908 --> 00:19:40,310
Bao, you're born in the Ox year?

237
00:19:40,405 --> 00:19:41,494
What's wrong?

238
00:19:41,629 --> 00:19:43,962
I always thought that you were my senior.

239
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,882
I didn't expect us to be the same age.

240
00:19:46,275 --> 00:19:47,579
The same age? Isn't that a coincidence?

241
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,842
Isn't it a coincidence? He's 12 years older than you.

242
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,170
Why did you have to point it out?

243
00:19:52,194 --> 00:19:54,034
You're putting so much pressure on the newbie.

244
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,709
Cheng Yao. Why do I see you so tired too?

245
00:19:59,796 --> 00:20:01,956
Did you get assigned tasks by the boss last night too?

246
00:20:02,193 --> 00:20:03,962
Will I have this honor?

247
00:20:04,063 --> 00:20:05,102
See?

248
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:06,322
The boss only loves me.

249
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,482
Disgusting.

250
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,642
Hey, colleagues.

251
00:20:13,977 --> 00:20:15,029
Good morning.

252
00:20:15,202 --> 00:20:17,082
Good morning, Lawyer Wu.

253
00:20:17,163 --> 00:20:18,834
Good morning.

254
00:20:21,442 --> 00:20:23,945
- Good morning. - This is Junheng's "Jun"?

255
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,602
It's so different from Lawyer Qian.

256
00:20:26,752 --> 00:20:28,252
One handles external and the other handles internal.

257
00:20:28,276 --> 00:20:29,602
The skill points are different.

258
00:20:33,822 --> 00:20:36,692
Don't think he's unreliable. Our team also handles litigation.

259
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,460
You must be the new Cheng Yao.

260
00:20:41,495 --> 00:20:43,322
- Hello, Lawyer Wu. - Hello.

261
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:45,008
You look pretty.

262
00:20:45,991 --> 00:20:47,562
Lawyer Wu, what are you doing?

263
00:20:47,715 --> 00:20:49,585
Rabbits don't eat grass from their own nest.

264
00:20:49,989 --> 00:20:50,989
What are you thinking?

265
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:53,228
I'm only thinking about getting the Golden Scale Award now.

266
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,052
Who has the mind to think about these things?

267
00:20:57,627 --> 00:20:58,927
Just work hard.

268
00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:06,930
Good morning, Lawyer Wu.

269
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:11,943
Tan Ying is really tough.

270
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:14,192
When she gets tough, even the boss gets scolded.

271
00:21:41,068 --> 00:21:43,109
Why can't you just accept

272
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:45,380
the treatment from the psychologist?

273
00:21:52,252 --> 00:21:53,932
You didn't sleep well last night, did you?

274
00:21:54,069 --> 00:21:55,790
Look at your dark circles.

275
00:21:55,967 --> 00:21:57,469
Their color even matches your sunglasses.

276
00:21:57,493 --> 00:22:00,002
Lawyer Wu. I'm working.

277
00:22:00,116 --> 00:22:02,042
I'm just looking out for you.

278
00:22:02,224 --> 00:22:03,722
Look at your current state of mind.

279
00:22:03,811 --> 00:22:05,811
If you don't sleep soon, you'll die of exhaustion.

280
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,630
What about I give you a day off?

281
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:08,870
Adjust yourself.

282
00:22:08,973 --> 00:22:09,993
Rest a bit.

283
00:22:10,983 --> 00:22:12,042
I don't mind.

284
00:22:12,222 --> 00:22:14,062
I'm just afraid your income will not be enough

285
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,483
to pay for your girlfriends as beautiful as flowers and jades.

286
00:22:16,507 --> 00:22:17,819
Stop it right now.

287
00:22:18,749 --> 00:22:22,482
I'm trying to be a better person now. I'm a model youth now.

288
00:22:23,316 --> 00:22:25,876
Why are you still bringing up the past? Why don't you let it go?

289
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:27,878
Gossiping is not a good habit.

290
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,230
You should change this bad habit.

291
00:22:29,858 --> 00:22:32,758
Besides, you still have that notorious reputation in the industry, right?

292
00:22:32,782 --> 00:22:35,102
Did you see me talking about that all the time? No, right?

293
00:22:35,175 --> 00:22:36,242
Qian.

294
00:22:36,642 --> 00:22:39,658
I'm serious about improving your team's reputation for being unsympathetic

295
00:22:39,739 --> 00:22:41,597
to lower your complaint rate.

296
00:22:42,307 --> 00:22:44,709
If I don't intervene now, with this kind of atmosphere,

297
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:47,730
it's only a matter of time before the client comes and paints the door.

298
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,242
I'm the only one

299
00:22:51,415 --> 00:22:55,082
who is endlessly tolerant and forgiving toward you for so many years.

300
00:22:56,026 --> 00:22:57,722
You never cared

301
00:22:58,697 --> 00:23:00,682
or asked about my well-being.

302
00:23:01,752 --> 00:23:02,989
So, let me ask you.

303
00:23:03,146 --> 00:23:04,697
Why does it have to be her?

304
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,562
I have investigated Cheng Yao.

305
00:23:08,706 --> 00:23:11,922
Although she is not the best, she meets Junheng's standards.

306
00:23:12,086 --> 00:23:13,726
The most important thing is

307
00:23:13,963 --> 00:23:16,510
she has a good personality and strong empathy.

308
00:23:16,638 --> 00:23:19,682
She can effectively reduce the friction between clients and us.

309
00:23:20,115 --> 00:23:21,475
I have already thought it through.

310
00:23:21,714 --> 00:23:23,282
Starting from today,

311
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:25,620
I will keep an eye on you guys.

312
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,223
Once the complaint rate drops low enough,

313
00:23:28,247 --> 00:23:29,638
that Golden Scale Award

314
00:23:30,297 --> 00:23:32,162
will be within reach, right?

315
00:23:34,338 --> 00:23:35,926
Are you really aiming for the Golden Scale Award?

316
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,846
Or do you want to fulfill your selfish desires? You know it in your heart.

317
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,070
What selfish desires?

318
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,962
- Explain it clearly. - Cheng Yao's older sister is Cheng Xi, right?

319
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:44,590
When you were in college,

320
00:23:44,671 --> 00:23:46,579
you didn't manage to pursue Cheng Xi, so you got angry,

321
00:23:46,603 --> 00:23:47,747
and got yourself a lot of girlfriends.

322
00:23:47,771 --> 00:23:49,439
Do you need me to recall the whole story?

323
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:52,502
Cheng Xi is an expert in property trusts.

324
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:55,223
If I can hire her, wouldn't it make up for your shortcomings? All right?

325
00:23:55,247 --> 00:23:56,682
So, did you hire her?

326
00:23:56,998 --> 00:23:59,706
I'm trying my best. You don't even have her phone number.

327
00:23:59,816 --> 00:24:02,161
You're adding to my burden with all your effort. Do you know that?

328
00:24:02,185 --> 00:24:03,802
How can that be a burden?

329
00:24:04,453 --> 00:24:05,773
I think Cheng Yao is pretty good.

330
00:24:05,846 --> 00:24:07,709
Give her some time and patience.

331
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,180
She'll grow in no time, all right?

332
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,350
Okay.

333
00:24:15,406 --> 00:24:18,178
Then, I need to hire a professional accountant to do the calculations.

334
00:24:18,202 --> 00:24:20,879
From the moment Cheng Yao entered the firm until she left,

335
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,122
I had to count the cost for every minute and every second.

336
00:24:23,146 --> 00:24:24,577
My time is very valuable.

337
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:32,019
You can't sleep but you're pretty good at counting money.

338
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,949
(Who can tell this big lawyer)

339
00:25:16,029 --> 00:25:18,070
(that money is never enough.)

340
00:25:18,337 --> 00:25:20,202
(Not sleeping will cost lives.)

341
00:25:42,132 --> 00:25:43,212
(Boss, I'm begging you.)

342
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:45,402
(Please go. I need to sleep.)

343
00:26:10,965 --> 00:26:11,965
Bye.

344
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,089
Boss, goodbye.

345
00:26:23,111 --> 00:26:25,021
I'm so sleepy.

346
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,442
Just working and not sleeping,

347
00:26:44,663 --> 00:26:47,693
even the smart kids will become stupid.

348
00:26:51,281 --> 00:26:52,882
Time to sleep.

349
00:28:02,069 --> 00:28:03,069
Cheng Yao.

350
00:28:04,972 --> 00:28:05,972
Cheng Yao.

351
00:28:07,322 --> 00:28:09,802
Don't make noise. I'm sleeping.

352
00:28:13,331 --> 00:28:14,722
Time to get up for the meeting.

353
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,242
What meeting?

354
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:18,117
Did you give me a case?

355
00:28:19,289 --> 00:28:20,682
Are you dreaming?

356
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:34,882
Boss.

357
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,140
I can explain.

358
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:41,750
Why are you staying here?

359
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,189
Since you kicked me out,

360
00:28:43,269 --> 00:28:44,830
I can't find a place to stay.

361
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:48,202
So, I wanted to stay at the firm for two days.

362
00:28:48,692 --> 00:28:49,762
But

363
00:28:50,121 --> 00:28:52,642
why don't you sleep late at night and come to the firm instead?

364
00:28:52,762 --> 00:28:54,546
- Are you not able to sleep? - I'm warning you

365
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:56,747
not to talk recklessly, or you'll be held responsible by the law.

366
00:28:56,771 --> 00:28:58,242
You're reacting so strongly.

367
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:05,082
I understand. You're here to work overtime, right?

368
00:29:06,048 --> 00:29:07,448
So, that morning...

369
00:29:07,529 --> 00:29:10,671
When I met you, you were going out instead of coming to work?

370
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,042
And one night,

371
00:29:13,605 --> 00:29:16,205
I suddenly heard Chinese for a while, and then English for a while.

372
00:29:16,229 --> 00:29:17,949
I thought I was dreaming.

373
00:29:18,162 --> 00:29:19,482
That was you too, right?

374
00:29:23,266 --> 00:29:26,430
So, I thought, there's no one in this world who's such a genius.

375
00:29:28,215 --> 00:29:30,499
Even you can't finish so much work without staying up late.

376
00:29:30,523 --> 00:29:31,783
I'm a genius.

377
00:29:32,394 --> 00:29:33,962
Even geniuses need time to solve cases.

378
00:29:36,662 --> 00:29:37,762
Boss, don't worry.

379
00:29:37,941 --> 00:29:40,322
I won't tell anyone about you working overtime secretly.

380
00:29:40,652 --> 00:29:42,922
I know you want to set a good example for us.

381
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,762
So, hard work does pay off.

382
00:29:45,843 --> 00:29:47,202
All right, just go.

383
00:29:47,283 --> 00:29:48,443
I still have something to do.

384
00:29:48,566 --> 00:29:50,282
- Do you need my help? - No.

385
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,562
- Boss. - I said no.

386
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:58,762
I just wanted to ask if I could stay here for two more days?

387
00:29:59,017 --> 00:30:00,842
Once I find a place, I will move out.

388
00:30:02,229 --> 00:30:03,970
Whatever. Just leave.

389
00:30:06,229 --> 00:30:07,369
Good night, boss.

390
00:30:07,851 --> 00:30:08,851
Wait.

391
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,002
Anything else you want me to do?

392
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:19,954
How can you sleep

393
00:30:20,681 --> 00:30:21,761
in such a bad environment?

394
00:30:21,842 --> 00:30:23,513
I just close my eyes and I'm asleep.

395
00:30:24,029 --> 00:30:25,282
My adaptability is strong.

396
00:30:25,363 --> 00:30:27,073
I can fall asleep anywhere.

397
00:30:27,871 --> 00:30:30,031
Do you want me to show you?

398
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,429
Just go.

399
00:30:34,709 --> 00:30:35,709
Leave already!

400
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,410
Don't work too hard.

401
00:30:41,016 --> 00:30:42,016
Just go.

402
00:30:42,567 --> 00:30:43,587
Good night, boss.

403
00:30:47,926 --> 00:30:49,755
"I just close my eyes and I'm asleep."

404
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:51,970
Are there people like that?

405
00:31:18,029 --> 00:31:20,019
(The wind and rain force me to become stronger.)

406
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:22,012
Time to get up.

407
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,890
The wish to wake up from a 500-square-meter large flat has been realized.

408
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,602
How nice.

409
00:32:22,863 --> 00:32:25,142
Article 1,076.

410
00:32:25,245 --> 00:32:27,442
If both spouses voluntarily divorce,

411
00:32:27,523 --> 00:32:29,722
they must sign a written divorce agreement

412
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,864
and apply for divorce registration in person

413
00:32:31,945 --> 00:32:33,762
at the divorce registration authority.

414
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:36,087
Article 1,076.

415
00:32:36,213 --> 00:32:38,254
If both spouses voluntarily divorce,

416
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,180
they must sign...

417
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,450
What are you doing?

418
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:46,049
Memorizing the law.

419
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,442
Why are you so happy for memorizing the law?

420
00:32:49,032 --> 00:32:51,329
My mentor said to love what you do.

421
00:33:00,892 --> 00:33:04,002
(He actually went to the office early without hesitation.)

422
00:33:04,353 --> 00:33:06,802
(Such an incredible person is being so strict with himself.)

423
00:33:07,064 --> 00:33:09,602
(So, being a bit harsher on me is acceptable, right?)

424
00:33:25,549 --> 00:33:27,709
Boss. You work late and overtime every day.

425
00:33:27,813 --> 00:33:31,042
You've worked too hard. I made you a cup of coffee to give you a boost.

426
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:34,435
Making coffee isn't something you need to do.

427
00:33:34,985 --> 00:33:36,002
It's okay.

428
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:39,423
I used to help my lawyer colleagues make coffee at my last firm.

429
00:33:40,003 --> 00:33:41,082
Cheng Yao.

430
00:33:41,251 --> 00:33:43,171
I don't think this is a job for a female lawyer.

431
00:33:43,329 --> 00:33:45,482
You are a lawyer, not an administrator.

432
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:47,029
I don't want you to think

433
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:50,322
that making coffee for colleagues or bosses makes you more friendly.

434
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:53,631
Have you ever seen a male lawyer making coffee for someone else?

435
00:33:54,212 --> 00:33:56,924
In the legal profession, women and men are equal.

436
00:33:57,431 --> 00:34:01,070
No gender is born to make coffee, book flights,

437
00:34:01,235 --> 00:34:03,329
print and photocopy documents, et cetera.

438
00:34:03,571 --> 00:34:04,882
I hope you can remember this.

439
00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:15,459
You're right. I won't do meaningless things like this again.

440
00:34:17,858 --> 00:34:18,858
So, tell me.

441
00:34:18,958 --> 00:34:20,388
What do you think is meaningful?

442
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:24,802
Boss. Can I join the case we discussed two days ago?

443
00:34:25,766 --> 00:34:27,069
I don't need a share.

444
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:31,419
I just want a chance to learn more from my boss and colleagues.

445
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,630
These are some ideas I have organized.

446
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:36,100
Boss, take a look.

447
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:45,790
Boss.

448
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:47,482
If you really

449
00:34:48,852 --> 00:34:50,079
can't agree to it,

450
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:54,189
then I can only share the news with our colleagues

451
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:57,626
that you stay late and work overtime at the office every day.

452
00:34:57,707 --> 00:34:58,707
Okay.

453
00:35:00,451 --> 00:35:01,602
Really?

454
00:35:02,837 --> 00:35:04,512
I'm talking about participating in the case.

455
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:05,722
Really?

456
00:35:07,451 --> 00:35:10,611
I knew it. I knew my efforts would be seen by you.

457
00:35:10,726 --> 00:35:12,076
I really didn't see it.

458
00:35:13,556 --> 00:35:16,024
I've let you participate but don't feel too good about yourself.

459
00:35:16,048 --> 00:35:17,926
In the firm, your foundation is relatively poor.

460
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,430
You also have little work experience.

461
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:22,202
You interned at another firm for a year,

462
00:35:22,283 --> 00:35:23,774
but you haven't handled a case independently.

463
00:35:23,798 --> 00:35:25,640
Yesterday night, you just looked at the case files for a bit.

464
00:35:25,664 --> 00:35:28,240
So, don't you say you worked hard, okay?

465
00:35:33,091 --> 00:35:35,042
Bao Rui fell down

466
00:35:35,246 --> 00:35:36,265
and twisted his foot.

467
00:35:39,459 --> 00:35:41,329
Should I express my concern for him?

468
00:35:42,732 --> 00:35:43,794
Because of the foot injury,

469
00:35:43,818 --> 00:35:45,778
he can't go to the Administration for Market Regulation

470
00:35:45,802 --> 00:35:47,736
to look up the company's records and equity situation,

471
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,351
so you'll do it for him.

472
00:35:49,788 --> 00:35:50,788
No problem.

473
00:35:51,396 --> 00:35:53,549
Also, I want to thank you on behalf of Bao Rui.

474
00:35:53,787 --> 00:35:54,865
No need to thank me.

475
00:35:54,946 --> 00:35:57,186
It's only natural for colleagues to help each other out.

476
00:35:57,232 --> 00:35:59,282
Thank you for giving up your share

477
00:35:59,638 --> 00:36:02,282
so he doesn't have to give you part of his share.

478
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:07,642
Okay. No problem.

479
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:10,299
I'll definitely try my best, follow your footsteps,

480
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,870
and allow you to sleep more and sleep better.

481
00:36:14,958 --> 00:36:16,190
All right, you should go now.

482
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:17,989
Don't do meaningless stuff. Okay.

483
00:36:18,069 --> 00:36:19,289
Thank you, boss.

484
00:36:35,565 --> 00:36:37,002
This is my ride.

485
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,540
What would happen if he found out about this?

486
00:36:58,593 --> 00:37:00,335
- Are you okay? - What are you talking about?

487
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:02,708
- Look at your leg. - You look happy.

488
00:37:03,951 --> 00:37:05,989
I just saw Cheng Yao run out in the rain.

489
00:37:06,154 --> 00:37:08,815
Should you get a cup of milk tea to reward her?

490
00:37:08,896 --> 00:37:12,230
Why? Running errands like this isn't rewarding.

491
00:37:12,458 --> 00:37:15,326
Even after running errands a hundred times, the boss may still not notice.

492
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:16,350
Right?

493
00:37:16,685 --> 00:37:19,922
But, this is the assignment the boss gave her this morning.

494
00:37:20,314 --> 00:37:21,354
That's good.

495
00:37:21,435 --> 00:37:23,781
He said it's because your foot is injured and can't fight for him now

496
00:37:23,805 --> 00:37:25,845
that he has reassigned the case he gave you to her.

497
00:37:30,896 --> 00:37:32,270
I can't stand,

498
00:37:32,568 --> 00:37:34,162
but I can still fight.

499
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,710
So, I,

500
00:37:38,957 --> 00:37:40,707
as Junheng's heir apparent,

501
00:37:41,172 --> 00:37:44,092
must definitely take care of every colleague.

502
00:37:44,334 --> 00:37:45,614
Cheng Yao...

503
00:37:45,765 --> 00:37:47,139
I'll just get some milk tea.

504
00:37:49,154 --> 00:37:50,922
Don't stand up anymore.

505
00:37:51,541 --> 00:37:52,541
You...

506
00:37:53,582 --> 00:37:54,922
Let's order takeout.

507
00:37:55,038 --> 00:37:56,242
Order takeout.

508
00:37:56,684 --> 00:37:57,994
Milk tea, right?

509
00:37:58,333 --> 00:37:59,512
Milk tea.

510
00:37:59,948 --> 00:38:01,147
Add pearls.

511
00:38:01,367 --> 00:38:02,660
Add boba.

512
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:03,962
Add coconut.

513
00:38:04,218 --> 00:38:06,195
Add sago and purple rice.

514
00:38:06,276 --> 00:38:08,156
You should just order an eight-treasure congee.

515
00:38:09,189 --> 00:38:10,250
Yeah.

516
00:38:11,086 --> 00:38:12,286
Eight-treasure congee with milk tea.

517
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:14,020
That's a bit gross.

518
00:38:14,524 --> 00:38:16,503
I'm not sure if you've hurt your leg or brain.

519
00:38:32,335 --> 00:38:33,434
The power is out?

520
00:38:50,069 --> 00:38:51,442
No way.

521
00:38:52,665 --> 00:38:54,495
The power and water are both out.

522
00:38:59,943 --> 00:39:02,002
- Colleague, can you... - I can't.

523
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:03,669
Boss.

524
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,882
It's too dark. I didn't see it was you.

525
00:39:06,211 --> 00:39:08,922
Can you fix the circuit? The circuit is broken.

526
00:39:09,024 --> 00:39:11,935
- For this kind of thing, you should ask Wu Jun. - Boss.

527
00:39:13,443 --> 00:39:15,992
Can I get in your car for a ride?

528
00:39:16,546 --> 00:39:18,617
I remember there is a hotel across the street from your house.

529
00:39:18,641 --> 00:39:21,482
I want to stay there for one night and take a hot bath.

530
00:39:22,028 --> 00:39:23,089
It's not on the way.

531
00:39:24,932 --> 00:39:26,282
Goodbye then.

532
00:40:08,627 --> 00:40:12,509
Article 1,076 of the Civil Code.

533
00:40:12,648 --> 00:40:16,482
If both spouses voluntarily divorce,

534
00:40:16,617 --> 00:40:19,259
they must sign a written...

535
00:40:19,499 --> 00:40:20,682
Who is that?

536
00:40:20,811 --> 00:40:21,870
Me.

537
00:40:23,301 --> 00:40:24,810
You scared me, boss.

538
00:40:25,036 --> 00:40:26,586
You're the one who's scarier.

539
00:40:26,781 --> 00:40:29,421
After all, not many people can do such a funny dance at the office

540
00:40:29,483 --> 00:40:30,703
this late at night.

541
00:40:31,186 --> 00:40:33,486
I'm not dancing. I'm doing calisthenics.

542
00:40:33,769 --> 00:40:35,722
It's too cold. I need to warm up.

543
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:38,469
All right.

544
00:40:38,589 --> 00:40:40,910
I'll let you use my bathroom for half an hour.

545
00:40:43,084 --> 00:40:44,965
You don't want that? Forget it.

546
00:40:45,992 --> 00:40:48,328
I knew it. You do care about your employees.

547
00:40:48,437 --> 00:40:50,162
I'll definitely work hard for you.

548
00:41:39,877 --> 00:41:41,922
(Thank you boss for lending me the bathroom.)

549
00:41:47,426 --> 00:41:49,376
(It's the same as when I left.)

550
00:41:49,803 --> 00:41:51,442
(Has the boss never cooked before?)

551
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:57,242
(Considering he lent me the bathroom, I'll make him something to eat.)

552
00:41:57,683 --> 00:42:00,605
(After all, he won't be like those third-rate idol dramas)

553
00:42:00,742 --> 00:42:02,968
(where he can't help but fall in love with me)

554
00:42:03,064 --> 00:42:04,537
(after tasting my cooking.)

555
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,482
What should I make?

556
00:43:24,879 --> 00:43:26,310
(I fell asleep again?)
