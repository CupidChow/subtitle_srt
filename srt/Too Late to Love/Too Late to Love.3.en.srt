1
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,200
I'm innocent. I'm innocent.

2
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,080
I killed Mr. Fang.

3
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,520
Why?

4
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:50,840
Come closer.

5
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,920
That day,

6
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,320
I went to talk to Mr. Fang about the salary.

7
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,200
He failed to negotiate.

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,640
He even fired me.

9
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,320
I shot him out of anger.

10
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,440
You brought a gun when talking about salary.

11
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,360
It's not mine

12
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:18,480
It's Mr. Fang.

13
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,800
My father never touches guns.

14
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,240
I said,

15
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,680
I want to take revenge on you.

16
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,960
Who asked you to marry Xia Duoduo?

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,280
I really don’t understand

18
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,039
How is she better than me?

19
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,759
She won't be as cruel as you.

20
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,680
just like you.

21
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,920
You're so cunning.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,520
Let's go. Let's go.

23
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:54,920
Are you crazy?

24
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,440
Hug me.

25
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,360
I'll tell you where the bloody clothes and guns are.

26
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,640
I can find them within half a day.

27
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,960
Do you believe me?

28
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,280
You're right. You're right.

29
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,680
You're smart, aren't you? You're smart.

30
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,680
You're smart.

31
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,840
But you did three wrong things.

32
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:07,920
First,

33
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,920
When I mentioned the key this morning,

34
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,800
you subconsciously saw my shirt pocket.

35
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,600
That means that's your goal.

36
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,240
Second,

37
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,400
When a pickpocket is stealing,

38
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,200
it will create a fierce physical conflict.

39
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,760
to distract them.

40
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,560
Third,

41
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,200
You said you love me,

42
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,520
but your body was stiff when you hugged me.

43
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,760
I told you.

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,960
You can't do that. You can't do this. You can't do this. You can't do this.

45
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,520
I found the evidence.

46
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,440
Director Jiang is really good at acting.

47
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,920
The same goes for you.

48
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,640
If I say

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,480
It's not mine.

50
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,840
Do you believe it?

51
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,960
[I'll be back soon.] [I'll be back soon.]

52
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,960
It's been two years.

53
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,360
I didn't expect you to be so stupid now.

54
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,320
You can't even tell such a simple game.

55
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,800
You wrongly accused a good person to help the real murderer.

56
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,920
I really want to thank you on behalf of Mr. Fang.

57
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,160
You are really his good son.

58
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,680
Lin Xingyuan.

59
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,640
Do you want to die?

60
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,880
What?

61
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,080
Will killing me

62
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,480
can change your stupid fact?

63
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,200
Do you think the honey trap will work on me?

64
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,680
Save it.

65
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,280
In my eyes,

66
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,000
you're no different from a corpse.

67
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:51,960
Lin Xingyuan.

68
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,440
What are you up to?

69
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,680
Take a guess.

70
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,480
I’m allergic to this kind of silk.

71
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,240
How could I wear this?

72
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,920
Did I wrong her?

73
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,560
Beichen!

74
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,560
Brother Beichen!

75
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,920
What happened to Xingyuan?

76
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,120
She’s allergic to silk.

77
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,200
She's not allergic to silk? What?

78
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,080
What?

79
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,400
We grew up together.

80
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,640
How could I not know if she was allergic?

81
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,560
I found this in the garden.

82
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,760
Please take it in for me.

83
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,560
Penicillin?

84
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,360
It's like this.

85
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,880
She's allergic to Penicillin.

86
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,920
She has rashes when touching it.

87
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,560
The poison inside

88
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,840
One milligram can kill 2,000 rats.

89
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,040
Just give up.

90
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,320
I won't do anything wrong to the Fang family.

91
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,440
Lin Xingyuan, you'll die a horrible death!

92
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,000
Lin Xingyuan.

93
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,920
Mrs. Wang, it’s OK.

94
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,440
Lin Xingyuan.

95
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,040
I underestimated you.

96
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,480
I didn't expect you to be so crazy.

97
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,680
Young Master.

98
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,680
This woman forced me to change my statement.

99
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,960
She wanted to poison me if I didn't obey.

100
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,680
You lied first.

101
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,440
I didn't kill Master Fang.

102
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,920
Why did you frame me?

103
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,640
Young Master.

104
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,000
I didn't. Don't believe her.

105
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,480
This evil woman is evil.

106
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,120
I didn't force her to change her statement.

107
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,320
I just want to ask the truth.

108
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,880
This method is really special.

109
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,560
If you can't get the truth you want,

110
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,920
if you can't get the truth you want.

111
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,080
I admit I lied to you.

112
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,159
But I didn't kill Master Fang.

113
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,000
Lin Xingyuan.

114
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,080
Is there a truth in your mouth?

115
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,360
I was telling the truth.

116
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,120
That day,

117
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,640
I heard Mrs. Wang shouting that Mr. Fang had an accident.

118
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,320
I thought he had an emergency.

119
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,760
so I rushed to the study.

120
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,560
On the way,

121
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,680
I found that I didn't take the medicine box.

122
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,000
So I came back to get the medicine box.

123
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,160
When I came in,

124
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,600
I found something wrong.

125
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,800
Someone must have come in.

126
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,920
Someone is trying to frame me.

127
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,360
I can't sit back and do nothing.

128
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,440
You can tell me directly.

129
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,200
Will you believe me?

130
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,200
I ran out in a mess

131
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,240
and bury my bloody clothes.

132
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,680
I want to find clues

133
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,000
to find clues.

134
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,720
Unexpectedly,

135
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,400
the murderer got a double insurance.

136
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,960
The bloody clothes are not enough.

137
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,840
Even Mrs. Wang insists that I killed Mr. Fang.

138
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,920
So you mean

139
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,920
Mrs. Wang was ordered

140
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,280
No way.

141
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,400
I know Mrs. Wang the best.

142
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,640
She likes to make things worse.

143
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,720
but she won’t make things up.

144
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,240
Chief Jiang,

145
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,560
why I killed Mr. Fang?

146
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,640
Maybe you were born to be a murderer.

147
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,120
Maybe you were instigated.

148
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,840
Maybe...

149
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,840
Did you seduce my father?

150
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,200
and got angry.

151
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,120
Mr. Fang and I are not in that kind of relationship.

152
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,840
I said that last time

153
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,360
just to piss you off.

154
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,120
In my life,

155
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,440
in my life.
