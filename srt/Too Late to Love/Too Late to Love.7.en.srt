1
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,160
OK.

2
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,480
It's not that serious.

3
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,560
I just have insomnia sometimes.

4
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,880
I don't need it.

5
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,280
You don't have to do that. I'll do it. I'll do it. Okay.

6
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,239
Don't worry, Miss.

7
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,880
The lock is of good quality.

8
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,280
The windows are nailed.

9
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,160
I guarantee no fly can fly out.

10
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,920
Bloody firewood.

11
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,320
We can't burn them. Let's go.

12
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:27,840
Dr. Lin.

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,080
I feel

14
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,479
It's so hot.

15
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:33,960
And then...

16
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,280
Pull yourself together. Okay.

17
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,360
What is this?

18
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,400
Director Jiang.

19
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,680
Are you done?

20
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,880
I was talking about me.

21
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,759
Why are you acting?

22
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:14,680
You...

23
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,160
I didn’t expect

24
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,400
Mr. Fang is so fierce.

25
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,440
Don’t come over.

26
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,000
You're

27
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,960
more and more beautiful now?

28
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,080
Your eyes are bright

29
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,800
with high nose.

30
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,680
All you know is fighting and killing.

31
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,640
Have you ever thought about me?

32
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,600
How did we end up like this?

33
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,000
Come on!

34
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,760
Done

35
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,240
Go get Brother Beichen.

36
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,200
Hurry up.

37
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,040
Give me the key.

38
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,120
Miss.

39
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,079
Young Master is not here.

40
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,959
He’s in bed.

41
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,720
Young Master.

42
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,120
Are you tired? No.

43
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:24,960
Impossible.

44
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,800
Brother Beichen won't lose his mind

45
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,000
so easily.

46
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,760
Tell me.

47
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:32,960
Do you two

48
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,520
have that?

49
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:36,960
What do you think?

50
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,720
Brother Beichen is a gentleman.

51
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,920
He's a decent man.

52
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,400
He won't fall in love with a woman like you.

53
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,800
He must

54
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,560
he wouldn't obey

55
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,360
and knocked himself out.

56
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,720
A gentleman.

57
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,120
What Director Jiang did just now

58
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,280
has nothing to do with these words.

59
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,560
So,

60
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,320
Young Master is really tired.

61
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,480
You bitch!

62
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,960
I can have a happy time with Chief Jiang.

63
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,200
I should thank you for your matchmaking.

64
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,920
What are you talking about?

65
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,760
This medicine is not common.

66
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,520
Find out the source.

67
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,400
we'll know who did it.

68
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,840
Fine.

69
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,960
It has nothing to do with me.

70
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,480
Let's go.

71
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,600
Miss, are you okay?

72
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,920
Who is so immoral to gossip here?

73
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,640
Jiang Beichen.

74
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,200
Since you chose Xia Duoduo,

75
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,640
why did you mess with me?

76
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,920
How could you do that?

77
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:36,720
Let go!

78
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,200
You're getting married next month.

79
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,920
Why are you bullying Dr. Lin?

80
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,960
Are you a human?

81
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,960
Let me explain.

82
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,760
You bastard!

83
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,640
Who are you to defend yourself?

84
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,720
You bastard!

85
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,480
Shut up!

86
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,760
Listen to me.

87
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,680
Shut up!

88
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,440
Dr. Lin.

89
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,600
I'll be responsible for you.

90
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:04,960
Responsibility?

91
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,200
If you're pregnant with my brother's baby,

92
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,240
I will take good care of you.

93
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,760
There's a misunderstanding.

94
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,440
The two of us...

95
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,080
Nothing like that happened.

96
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,200
Really.

97
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,760
Yes.

98
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,120
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

99
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,320
Did you give me a chance?

100
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,160
You should have told me earlier.

101
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,440
By the way,

102
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,400
Director Jiang,

103
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,720
Take care of your fiancee.

104
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,200
I don't want to go through this every time.

105
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,000
I...

106
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,720
What happened?

107
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Leave me alone!

108
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,320
Brother.

109
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,360
Can you stay away from Dr. Lin?

110
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,160
Are you still in love with her?

111
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,720
That's impossible. I'll go with you. I'll go with you.
