1
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,200
The two families will be together. That's right.

2
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,400
and get married.

3
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,160
May you be together forever.

4
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,400
The same name.

5
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,880
Look at this day.

6
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,040
The peach blossom is blazing.

7
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,320
A good family for a good family.

8
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,480
May you have another year.

9
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,720
Sweet melon.

10
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,120
and prosperous.

11
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,240
I'll make a promise to grow old together.

12
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,720
[I'll write to Honghu]

13
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,000
so that the alliance of red leaves

14
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,720
and show them the matchmaker.

15
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,880
Brides and grooms.

16
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,120
Let's hold a son's hand.

17
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,720
Sign the marriage agreement. Yes.

18
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,320
The ceremony is complete.

19
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,680
Mrs. Wang.

20
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,560
I want to make a toast

21
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,680
Cheers.

22
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,920
It's not appropriate.

23
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,720
It's against the rules.

24
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,840
It's okay, Mrs. Wang.

25
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,400
From now on,

26
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,600
is the rule.

27
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,280
Okay.

28
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,840
Uncle Yu.

29
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,320
Let's sit down.

30
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:07,840
Okay.

31
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,160
Please take a seat.

32
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,160
Uncle Yu.

33
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,720
I'll find a way to deal with Xiao Man.

34
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,480
Uncle Yu trusts you.

35
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,520
Sit down, everyone.

36
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,280
Okay.

37
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,360
Today is

38
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,040
Beichen.

39
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,000
It's the big day of Xingyuan.

40
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,480
Let's

41
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,640
to them.

42
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,800
I wish you

43
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,360
to love each other

44
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,600
in the long life

45
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,520
and grow old together.

46
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,720
and be happy forever.

47
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,200
Thank you, Uncle Yu.

48
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,440
Thank you, Uncle Yu.

49
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,720
Thank you.

50
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,640
Have a seat.

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,920
Sit.

52
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:25,720
Let's go.

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,360
Here.

54
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,160
Uncle Yu.

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,560
From now on,

56
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,680
I may not go back often.

57
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,920
I have to trouble you

58
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,320
please

59
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,480
to visit my mother.

60
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,760
and burn some incense for me.

61
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,360
Don't worry.

62
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,360
It's my duty.

63
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,040
I wish you

64
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,960
happy wedding.

65
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,040
Thank you.

66
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,320
Yilin.

67
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:23,720
Yi Lin.

68
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,520
From now on,

69
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,560
in the future.

70
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,880
Don't worry.

71
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,640
He will.

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,560
Of course.

73
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,640
It's my duty.

74
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,440
Here.

75
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,120
I wish you

76
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,800
be united

77
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,040
and grow old together.

78
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,840
Wish you two

79
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,440
and be together forever.

80
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,640
and grow old together.

81
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,160
Beichen, Xingyuan.

82
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,320
I'm so clumsy.

83
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,200
Xingyuan, let me take you to clean up.

84
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,040
I should go.

85
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,320
It's inappropriate for you to go.

86
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,040
Mrs. Wang, you go.

87
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,680
It's okay.

88
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,040
I can go alone.

89
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,080
Go on.

90
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,560
Uncle Yu, have a seat.

91
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:30,800
Come on.

92
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,400
It's okay.

93
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,200
Have a seat.

94
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,080
Come on.

95
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,640
Drink more on your wedding day.

96
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,280
Come on drink more

97
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,400
Come on, bro.

98
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,320
Here's to you.

99
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,720
No more words, it's all in the wine.

100
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,200
My stomach hurts.

101
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,240
I need to go to the toilet.

102
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,520
Take your time.

103
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,080
It's okay. Enjoy your meal.

104
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,240
What's wrong with Lawyer Yu today?

105
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,280
You look flustered.

106
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,200
Come on.

107
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,120
Let's drink.

108
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,360
Let me.

109
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,200
Let me.

110
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,000
Xingyuan.

111
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,720
Open the door!

112
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,080
I know who the murderer is.

113
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,920
His tone and rhythm are the same.

114
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,280
It must be him.

115
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,880
Lin Xingyuan.

116
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,200
Cherish your last time.

117
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,320
After tonight,

118
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,640
Where did you go?

119
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,120
To the bathroom.

120
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,080
What are you doing here?

121
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,160
I have to ask you something in person.

122
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,640
Do you believe that my brother is innocent?

123
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,920
He is the murderer?

124
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,200
Then why did you marry him?

125
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,800
I'd rather believe that he loves me.

126
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,080
He won't kill me.

127
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,200
and marry me.

128
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,600
and get the inheritance.

129
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,920
why not?

130
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,240
What if you lose?

131
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,560
What if he does it tonight?

132
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,440
Stop talking.

133
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,600
I've made up my mind.

134
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,080
Do you know how long I waited for this day?

135
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,560
I can finally call you

136
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,720
Madam.

137
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,840
Madam.

138
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,480
You're so beautiful.

139
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,480
Wait.

140
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,720
I have a gift for you.
