1
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,280
It's here. It's here.

2
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,720
Have a look

3
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,360
Is it made here?

4
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,240
Excuse me.

5
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,360
Is there a problem with the clothes?

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,400
Just tell me if it's made here.

7
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,480
Judging from the material,

8
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,080
Look at the line

9
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,200
It was me. It was me.

10
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,000
Do you remember

11
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,200
the person who came here to make this?

12
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,200
She was wearing a veil. I didn't see her clearly.

13
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,760
But when I measured her size,

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,560
I saw a red mole on her left chest.

15
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,360
It's red.

16
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,360
It's dazzling.

17
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,840
Dr. Lin, this way please.

18
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,800
Director is waiting for you in the screen.

19
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,320
Mrs. Wang.

20
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,759
Dr. Lin, take off your clothes.

21
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,120
Why should I take off my clothes?

22
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,960
Just take it off.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,200
Mrs. Wang, I apologize for what happened last time.

24
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,240
But I didn't really stab you.

25
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,040
You don't have to...

26
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,000
Young Master asked me to do it. It's none of my business.

27
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,120
Jiang Beichen!

28
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,840
Jiang Beichen!

29
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,560
Jiang Beichen, come out!

30
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,600
Jiang Beichen!

31
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:15,920
Jiang Beichen

32
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,240
Jiang Beichen!

33
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,800
Jiang Beichen, come out!

34
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:28,680
Mrs. Wang, stop!

35
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,160
Eldest Young Master.

36
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,120
She has it! She has it!

37
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,320
She has it in her chest.

38
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,240
I told you it was you.

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,120
Lin Xingyuan.

40
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,560
You always bring me surprises.

41
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,760
Jiang Beichen.

42
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,880
I'm not interested in being mad with you.

43
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,200
The evidence is clear.

44
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,079
You want to leave?

45
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,000
Mrs. Wang has bad eyesight.

46
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,280
It's a rose petal.

47
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,720
You can go now.

48
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,040
Seriously,

49
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,200
If you have a brain problem, go and see him.

50
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,000
It won't be easy to cure at the terminal stage.

51
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,280
You can go in.

52
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,320
What are you doing inside?

53
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,240
He told me not to tell you.

54
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,400
I treated you for nothing.

55
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,040
I don't know the details.

56
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,400
I just went in and pulled my collar open.

57
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,680
Show your chest

58
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,560
I don't know what to look at.

59
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,000
Miss Yu.

60
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,000
Where are you going?

61
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,920
I'm going to the bathroom. I'll be right back.

62
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,040
The chief ordered us

63
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,519
Don't go anywhere.

64
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,959
Please bear with it.

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,880
What's going on?

66
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,120
Miss Xia.

67
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,240
I advise you not to go in.

68
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,760
What's wrong?

69
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,360
I'm not sure.

70
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,080
Forget it. I'll check it myself.

71
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,320
Miss Xia.

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,880
You can't tell Brother Beichen that I told you.

73
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,360
Look at the maids at the door.

74
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,920
Brother Beichen has gone too far this time.

75
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,640
You haven't married yet.

76
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,960
Pick a concubine first

77
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,240
I heard you have to open your clothes and look at your chest.

78
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,240
It's a slap in your face.

79
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,440
Miss Xia.

80
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,320
Get in! Get out of here!

81
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:29,960
You can't go in.

82
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,720
Let me in.

83
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,800
You can't go in.

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,480
Go away.

85
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,800
Miss Xia.

86
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,560
Get out!

87
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:37,800
Brother Beichen.

88
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,200
Miss Xia.

89
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,159
Calm down.

90
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:39,840
Go away.

91
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:40,960
Chief.

92
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,680
I can't stop him.

93
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,320
Brother Beichen.

94
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,200
What's wrong with those women?

95
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,760
I'm investigating a case.

96
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,920
What kind of case do you need to strip people's clothes?

97
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,240
I don't care.

98
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,240
Kick them out!

99
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,200
I'm investigating the murderer who killed my father.

100
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,440
Do I have to report this to you?

101
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,159
That's not what I meant.

102
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,200
If you don't want to get married, don't.

103
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,760
It's all because of Ms. Oh.

104
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,440
He insisted on stopping me.

105
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,360
I misunderstood you.

106
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,720
Miss Xia,

107
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,360
I misunderstood Brother Beichen.

108
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,160
I'm really sorry.

109
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,520
Where are you going, Miss Xia?

110
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,000
To the mourning hall.

111
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,560
to visit Uncle Fang.

112
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,640
Unfortunately, Uncle Fang

113
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,320
will never see your wedding with Brother Beichen again.

114
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,280
When I catch the murderer,

115
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,400
I will ask my father to cut him into pieces

116
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,560
and chop him into pieces.

117
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,760
Miss Xia,

118
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,360
Don't listen to the servants.

119
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,240
Xingyuan has nothing to do with this.

120
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,520
Xingyuan.

121
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,440
It's the doctor.

122
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,680
Mrs. Wang insisted that Xingyuan killed Uncle Fang.

123
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,920
But Brother Beichen still let her go.

124
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,000
In the end,

125
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,600
because of lack of evidence.

126
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,880
has nothing to do with their past.

127
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,360
Wait a minute.

128
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,320
They used to

129
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,560
have something to do.

130
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,440
Don't worry.

131
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,760
They will never reconcile.

132
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,600
I heard

133
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,920
Xingyuan hurt Brother Beichen deeply.

134
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,560
He won't forgive her.

135
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,520
What is it?

136
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,840
It's her.

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,480
Brother Beichen.

138
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,680
Yes.

139
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,360
Otherwise, how can you be with Brother Beichen?

140
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,720
So,

141
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,280
I should thank that bitch.

142
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,320
That's not what I meant.

143
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,880
Miss Xia.

144
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,560
Miss Xia, please don't mind.

145
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,480
It's all my fault.

146
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,480
Murderer!

147
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,120
How dare you be here?

148
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,600
Miss Xia.

149
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,280
You need evidence.

150
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,280
A dead person?

151
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,960
What are you doing? Catch her!

152
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,040
Stop!

153
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,560
Brother Beichen!

154
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,280
Are you going to protect her?

155
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,640
What happened?

156
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,960
She hit me.

157
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,680
Look.

158
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,960
She's glaring at me.

159
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,200
She's already acting up.

160
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,840
Looks like you still want to stay inside.

161
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,680
Don’t say that.

162
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,360
If you're going to be imprisoned for worshipping the elders,

163
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,080
That's a slander.

164
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,600
for slandering others

165
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,520
How many years should he be sentenced?

166
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,640
Her father is Mr. Xia.

167
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,800
Don't talk nonsense.

168
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,680
So you only care about power

169
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,040
you only care about power.

170
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,160
Cut the crap.

171
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,120
I'll tell my father

172
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,600
to catch the murderer.

173
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,360
Duoduo,

174
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,520
You shouldn’t torture me.

175
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,600
Leave it to me.

176
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,240
Don't get your hands dirty.
