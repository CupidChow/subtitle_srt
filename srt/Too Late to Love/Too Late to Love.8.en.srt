1
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,200
Let's go! Let's go!

2
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,200
Brother Beichen.

3
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,160
Will he break off the engagement with me?

4
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,200
Don't worry. I'll be back soon.

5
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,600
I went out to buy medicine.

6
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,840
when I went out to buy medicine.

7
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,040
Look at this. Look at this.

8
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,040
That's good. That's good.

9
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,480
Miss Xia.

10
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,720
"Look, look, look, look, look." "Look, look, look."

11
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,440
Please help me.

12
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,360
Now everyone in Fang's mansion knows that she and Brother Beichen had an accident.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,400
Brother Beichen will be doomed if he doesn't marry her.

14
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,320
Everyone in the Fang Mansion

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,520
They're here. They're here. They're here. They're here.

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,080
By the way,

17
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,840
You can do it. You can do it.

18
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,720
Just be a good man to the end.

19
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,760
Be careful. Be careful.

20
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:15,760
Put it down. Put it down.

21
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:16,680
You can't do it. You can't do it.

22
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,760
I caught the adulterer.

23
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,280
You know it too?

24
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,640
Mr. Wang next door knows it.

25
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:23,640
It must be Lin Xingqi.

26
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,480
Miss Xia.

27
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,480
Don't blame her.

28
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:28,200
She suffered so much.

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,400
She just wanted to complain.

30
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,560
She just wants to force Brother Beichen to break off the engagement with me.

31
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,520
to marry her.

32
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,600
You misunderstood me.

33
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:36,039
She is not that kind of person.

34
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:38,720
When Brother Beichen marries her,

35
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,080
and marry you.

36
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,160
What?

37
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,360
You want me to be your concubine?

38
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,840
That's not what I meant, Miss Xia.

39
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,320
I'm not.

40
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,479
Stop it.

41
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,280
Miss!

42
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,200
Hello. Hello.

43
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,600
Hello.

44
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,160
What would you like to order?

45
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,560
Anything.

46
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,840
Can I try it, boss?

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,640
Sure.

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,520
Here you go.

49
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,960
One sugar cream.

50
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:25,440
Okay.

51
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,960
I want to make new clothes.

52
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,640
Pick a special button.

53
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,560
Do you know

54
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,680
where there is a factory that makes buttons?

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,120
There's one nearby.

56
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:39,840
I'll take you there.

57
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,440
Sir, your sugar cream.

58
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,360
Thank you.

59
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:48,920
Don't move.

60
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,800
Brother, Miss Xia.

61
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,280
Are you here to buy wedding candies?

62
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,720
Yes.

63
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,280
Miss Lin is knowledgeable.

64
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,040
How about

65
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,280
pick out wedding candies for me and Brother Beichen?

66
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,960
I'll choose the wedding candies myself. Is it sweet?

67
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,880
I think Dr. Lin

68
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,440
to help others.

69
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,440
Chief Jiang must like this candy.

70
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,600
My mind is empty.

71
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,040
It's better to use it as a decoration.

72
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,680
Brother Beichen.

73
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,880
The candy looks good.

74
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,400
It's better than this candy.

75
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,120
It looks sweet

76
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,600
If you eat too much,

77
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,600
I'm afraid I'll die young.

78
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,200
Delicious.

79
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,440
I'll take the risk.

80
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,720
With me here,

81
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,480
Mr. Fang will live a long life.

82
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,520
Brother Beichen.

83
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,160
Do you still want the candy?

84
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,520
Brother.

85
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,720
Brother.

86
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,440
Brother Beichen.

87
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,360
Don't go.

88
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,240
Let's go.

89
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,079
Xingyuan.

90
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,320
The button factory is on the street ahead.

91
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,440
Stop!

92
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:27,920
Stop!

93
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,760
Leave this little beauty here.

94
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,960
Dr. Lin, run!

95
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,640
Yilin.

96
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,320
Yilin.

97
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,200
Let's go.

98
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,159
Yilin.

99
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,280
Let go of me!

100
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,520
Pretty.

101
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,640
Stop struggling.

102
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,120
Let me take it out for you.

103
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,000
Sure.

104
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,400
Not bad.

105
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,360
When the towel is stuck in your mouth,

106
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,680
the tongue naturally rolls up.

107
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,920
It's not full at all.

108
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,720
You can spit it out if you're a human.

109
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,000
As soon as I join the gang, I'm the middle level.

110
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,720
I really don't know the basic operation.

111
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,720
Is that so?

112
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,800
I think so.

113
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,960
Why didn't you tell me?

114
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,760
Tell me.

115
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,000
What are you doing?

116
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,720
Hey!

117
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,840
Taking money to get rid of misfortune.

118
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,560
They will never let you go back to Rong City.

119
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,720
But now,

120
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,960
change my mind.

121
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,400
How much did Xia Duoduo give you?

122
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,320
Did I say it was her?

123
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,600
You said it now.

124
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,640
I think she found out.

125
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,400
No matter how much she gives you,

126
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,600
I'll pay double.

127
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,560
Just pretend to be attacked by me.

128
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,720
and let me go.

129
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,400
Am I that greedy man?

130
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,120
Five times.

131
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Pretty,

132
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,560
Just accept your fate.

133
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,960
I'm a soldier.

134
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,680
I'll never give up on money.

135
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:51,960
Brother.

136
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,200
Didn't you come here as a deserter?

137
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,120
You know nothing.

138
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,200
That's called strategic retreat.

139
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,560
I won't fight a battle that I'm not sure of.

140
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,040
Ten times.

141
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,640
You're insulting me.

142
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,480
20 times.

143
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,000
Deal.

144
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,800
Boss,

145
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,520
Our reputation is important.

146
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,280
If your peers know about this,

147
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,880
if you let your colleagues know?

148
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,440
Right, brother, didn't you say

149
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,920
we can't break the rules because of small losses.

150
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,080
Pretty,

151
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,680
give up those unrealistic fantasies.

152
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,520
Marry me

153
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,280
is your only choice.

154
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,880
Let me go.

155
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,200
You can get the money

156
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,040
and Chief Jiang.

157
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,560
You dare not fight such a confident battle.

158
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,320
You really are a deserter.

159
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,320
Brother.

160
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,960
I'll take her to wash up

161
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,360
and get you some new clothes.

162
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,560
How is it?

163
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,040
Haven't you read dialogue novels?

164
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,600
That's how you

165
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,040
is caused by you.

166
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,120
I want to get married now.

167
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,440
Get out.

168
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,640
Yes.

169
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,360
Pretty, let's go.

170
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:05,960
Yilin.

171
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:06,920
Yilin.

172
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,240
Wake up.

173
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,840
What's going on?

174
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:14,960
Brother!

175
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,720
Save Dr. Lin! She was taken away!

176
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,600
Don't worry.

177
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,320
Where did she go?

178
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,960
I don't know.

179
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,800
It's okay.

180
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,400
Pretty.

181
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,560
I'm here.

182
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,080
Don't come over.

183
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:42,800
Pretty.

184
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,880
Don't come over.

185
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,159
Darn it.

186
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,960
Come on.

187
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,240
Let go of me!

188
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,840
Let go of me!

189
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,800
Keep an eye on him. I need to pee.

190
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,840
Who is it?

191
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:29,920
What's going on?

192
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:37,799
What's going on?

193
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,720
Hand him over.

194
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,080
Or should I beat you up?

195
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,920
Give it back.

196
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,000
Brother.

197
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,360
He seems to be the director of the police station, Jiang Beichen.

198
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,360
I’m not blind.

199
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,760
I can see that.

200
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,440
Why don't we retreat strategically first?

201
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,160
We are from Shark Gang.

202
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,840
and the president.

203
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,880
Don’t be afraid.

204
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,600
I'm in a good mood today.

205
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,520
I'll give you a chance.

206
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,640
Let's have a duel.

207
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,000
As long as you defeat all of my brothers,

208
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,080
Take them away.

209
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,280
What do you think?

210
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,480
What are you looking at? Get up!

211
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,160
Get up!

212
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:23,880
Get up!

213
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,120
Get up.

214
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,680
You're good at fighting.

215
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,000
I suggest

216
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,920
let's have another duel.

217
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,200
Are you sure?

218
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,760
I'm sure you'll die faster.

219
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,360
Wen Dou.

220
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,080
I'm afraid you'd rather die.

221
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,920
Lin Xingyuan.

222
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,680
It hurts.

223
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,720
Lin Xingyuan.

224
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,720
Lin Xingyuan.

225
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,120
Lin Xingyuan.

226
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,040
Lin Xingyuan.

227
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,440
It's none of your business.

228
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,080
I can block this shot myself.

229
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,400
I went to save you

230
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,680
to keep you safe.

231
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,360
Look at you.

232
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,320
lying here

233
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,880
You're causing me trouble.

234
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,200
You're afraid of pain,

235
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,160
why did you rush over?

236
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,200
If you didn't shoot,

237
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,640
What if someone shot you?

238
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,520
I'm not afraid.

239
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,000
You'll protect me.

240
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,840
What if

241
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,160
someone shot me?

242
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,320
I'll hide away.

243
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,880
You're so good.

244
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,680
You'll be fine.
