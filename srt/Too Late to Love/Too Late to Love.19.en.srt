1
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,519
It's for you. It's for you.

2
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,080
I have a gift for you.

3
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,000
Your Ladyship.

4
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,520
You're here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

5
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,560
Don't call me madam.

6
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,880
The murderer who killed my mother.

7
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,120
How dare you call me Madam?

8
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,360
I didn't kill her.

9
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,840
How did you manage to work in Rong City

10
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,280
while buying cakes in Mengzhou?

11
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:42,680
And that button.

12
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,640
You like that coat so much?

13
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,720
Do you have to sew it?

14
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,320
Isn't it good to lose it?

15
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,200
I did go to your mother

16
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,520
and asked about your whereabouts.

17
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,120
But before I left,

18
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,920
she was fine.

19
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,120
Why did you hide it from me? I didn't mean it.

20
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,400
We had a misunderstanding. We had a misunderstanding.

21
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,360
because of a misunderstanding.

22
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,240
for two years.

23
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,760
I don't want to make the same mistake.

24
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,000
So you did all this

25
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,040
because you love me so much.

26
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,079
I'm so touched.

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,440
What are you trying to say?

28
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,520
Tomorrow is the tenth day.

29
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,280
When Mr. Xia kills me,

30
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,280
you can take all the inheritance of the Fang family.

31
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,320
right?

32
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,280
So you think I did it for money

33
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,120
I did it to protect you.

34
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,280
If you weren't my wife,

35
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,680
Mr. Xia wouldn't be afraid of you.

36
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,520
Also,

37
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,800
if I hadn't found

38
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,720
the murderer,

39
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,280
or get married in a hurry.

40
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,960
So you know who the murderer is?

41
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,760
Fang Yilin,

42
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,520
Are you trying to frame everyone in the Fang family?

43
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,400
He has been pretending to be sick.

44
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:46,560
He pretended to be a pig and cheated all of us.

45
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,480
Have you forgotten what I do?

46
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,240
I can tell if he's really sick or not.

47
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,560
He took medicine that will damage his body.

48
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,360
Enough!

49
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,960
Who would be so crazy?

50
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,360
with his own life?

51
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,960
Look at you.

52
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,840
You're disgusting.

53
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,280
Disgusting.

54
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,480
If you think I'm disgusting,

55
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,440
why did you marry me?

56
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,600
Just to

57
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,240
to be able to

58
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,520
in a room like this,

59
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,520
kill me.

60
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,840
Lin Xingyuan!

61
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,080
Do you really

62
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,680
have no feelings for me?

63
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,920
No.

64
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,680
In that case,

65
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,840
Shoot me.

66
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,520
Shoot!

67
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,960
Why is there a gunshot?

68
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,360
It's okay.

69
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,080
My brother and Xingyuan are having fun inside.

70
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,040
Go back.

71
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,760
Don't disturb them.

72
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,080
Let's go.

73
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:35,960
Let's go back.

74
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,360
They're having fun.

75
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,760
Xingyuan.

76
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,800
Why are you so foolish?

77
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,440
I finally avenged my parents.

78
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,840
A life for a life.

79
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,560
It's all my fault.

80
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,160
I didn't stop you earlier.

81
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,200
I'm useless as your brother.

82
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,880
Xingyuan, hurry!

83
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,080
Give me the gun.

84
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,080
I killed him.

85
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,600
It has nothing to do with you.

86
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,640
I'll take the responsibility.

87
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,560
Be good.

88
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,200
Give it to me.

89
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,480
My body

90
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,200
for many years.

91
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,480
It's perfect for me to take the blame.

92
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,520
If the Fang family doesn't have you,

93
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,320
it's over.

94
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,880
Come on. Come on.

95
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,880
Give it to me.

96
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,480
I'll kneel down, okay?

97
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,000
Hurry.

98
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,400
Give it to me.

99
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,159
Why?

100
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,640
Why?

101
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,360
Your eyes now

102
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,440
are exactly the same

103
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,680
when your mother died.

104
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,680
You killed my mother.

105
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,360
You killed my mother.

106
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,560
Why did you kill her? You killed her!

107
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,600
It's simple.

108
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,840
She wants to marry into the Fang family.

109
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Does she deserve it?

110
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,680
Why?

111
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,400
Why did you do that?

112
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,200
You all missed it 20 years ago.

113
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,320
Why don't you believe in fate?

114
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,520
Why?

115
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,200
If you don't believe in fate,

116
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,600
I wish you

117
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,679
be united

118
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,680
and grow old together.

119
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,480
Underground.

120
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,040
You killed my father.

121
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,440
You're a beast.

122
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,080
You even killed your own father.

123
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,040
He doesn't deserve to be my father.

124
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:35,920
Yes.

125
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,040
All my assets

126
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,840
to Lin Xingyuan.

127
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,360
OK.

128
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,240
Why?

129
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,240
Because she's that bitch's daughter?

130
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,120
Bastard!

131
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,520
I knew it was you.

132
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,560
You killed Ru Meng.

133
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,640
So what?

134
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,880
You little... You little...

135
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,440
You...

136
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,840
turn yourself in tomorrow.

137
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,520
I'm your son.

138
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,120
How could you watch me die?

139
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,760
I don't have a son like you.

140
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,040
You're just like your mother.

141
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,560
as your mother.

142
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,800
I shouldn't have given birth to you in the first place. I'm sorry.
