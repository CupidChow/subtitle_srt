1
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,800
That shameless mother of yours is to blame. I'll go out for a while. Okay.

2
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:48,840
I'll go out for a while.

3
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:49,840
Stop!

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,520
Are you going to find that bitch again?

5
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,280
If you dare to go out today,

6
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,480
don't come back again.

7
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:58,920
Rascal!

8
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,200
You are unreasonable

9
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,280
Let's go. Let's go.

10
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,160
Mother.

11
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,160
If your mother hadn't seduced my father,

12
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,840
and made my father distracted,

13
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,920
He didn't go home every day.

14
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,560
my mother wouldn't have hung herself.

15
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,920
She made me lose the person I love the most.

16
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:50,560
I'll let her experience the pain of losing you.

17
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,560
That's right.

18
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,960
That day,

19
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,560
I told Zhou Fu where you were.

20
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,240
It's a pity that you're lucky.

21
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,520
You ran away.

22
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,280
God is on my side.

23
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,000
I saw you running out of the church.

24
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,000
The light was dim that day.

25
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,320
and he was unconscious.

26
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,120
and mistook me for you.

27
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,480
Great.

28
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,640
Isn’t it better for you to kill each other?

29
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,760
Why did you kill Master Fang and Xia Duoduo?

30
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,800
If you kill Master Fang,

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,120
will only make Brother Beichen hate you more.

32
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,440
As for Xia Duoduo,

33
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,480
she was just unlucky.

34
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,200
Mother! Mother! Mother!

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,880
Mother! Mother! Mother!

36
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,640
Your mother deserves to die.

37
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,560
My mother never gets close to other men for me.

38
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,720
let alone Uncle Yu.

39
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,800
She always treats Uncle Yu as her elder brother.

40
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,040
Even if Uncle Yu has any thoughts,

41
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,560
it has nothing to do with my mother.

42
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,480
And this one.

43
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,720
And me.

44
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,280
who treats you as my sister.

45
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,640
Don't you feel sad

46
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,040
feel sad?

47
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,760
Lock her up in the wood room.

48
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:04,920
Okay.

49
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,160
Over there.

50
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,360
Okay.

51
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,520
Don't keep thinking in your room.

52
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,080
I'll find you something to do.

53
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,000
Come on.

54
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,680
Fill this up.

55
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,720
Is there no servant in Fang's mansion?

56
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,200
Yes.

57
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,720
But...

58
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,880
I prefer the happiness I pick myself.

59
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,120
And

60
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,240
the romance I picked with you.

61
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,400
You must have misunderstood romance.

62
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,720
Are you okay?

63
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,200
What are you doing?

64
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,160
I'll stop the bleeding.

65
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,640
Such a small wound.

66
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,360
Press the blood vessels at the root of the finger.

67
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,960
The bleeding will stop in two seconds.

68
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,160
Besides,

69
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,680
Even if I leave it alone,

70
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,120
five minutes will do.

71
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,200
Your mouth is full of bacteria, you know?

72
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,280
Your wound

73
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,160
are infected by you.

74
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,040
I know.

75
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,880
Does it still hurt?

76
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,600
Of course it hurts.

77
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,360
I thought

78
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,440
you only know how to send weapons.

79
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,840
It's pretty.

80
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,920
Delicious.

81
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,680
It's unique.

82
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,040
What do you think?

83
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,560
Do you like it?

84
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,640
What a feast!

85
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,080
Where are my flowers?

86
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,480
In the pot.

87
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,200
What about my feelings?

88
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,760
Okay.

89
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,240
You're ruining my feelings.

90
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,960
Take it back.

91
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,200
Not enough.

92
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,440
Enough?

93
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,280
She's a wicked woman! She's a wicked woman! She's a wicked woman! She's a wicked woman!

94
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,400
Didn't you say she's a vicious woman?

95
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,679
who will be killed?

96
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,680
Didn't you say you don't like her?

97
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,000
What did you tell me before?

98
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,640
Why did you break your promise?

99
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,280
Let him have some tea and calm down.

100
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,480
You know I like her.

101
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,960
but you still want to steal it from me.

102
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,640
What kind of brother are you?

103
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,560
What are you talking about?

104
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,760
Aren't you going to talk to him?

105
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,080
Listen to me.

106
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,800
It'll be awkward if I go.

107
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,400
It's better to embarrass them alone.

108
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,840
Calm down.

109
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,040
Okay.

110
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,960
Listen to me.

111
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,200
We fell in love two years ago.

112
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,640
We parted because of some misunderstanding.

113
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,160
Then you fall behind too.

114
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,520
You need to line up, you know?

115
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,800
Sorry.

116
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,040
I'm sorry.

117
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,520
But...

118
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,560
I can't change.

119
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,880
Hit me.

120
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,800
I won't hide anymore.

121
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:45,840
I promise.

122
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,640
I won't answer it.

123
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,760
I'm not hiding.

124
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,080
You...

125
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,920
I...

126
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,520
Forget it this time.

127
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,600
If you dare to treat Dr. Lin badly,

128
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,160
I'll kill you.

129
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,840
Nothing I like.

130
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,920
I've informed Mr. Xia.

131
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,760
the murderer has been caught.

132
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,360
Okay.

133
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,960
Take her to the police station now.

134
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,200
I’ll take her there.

135
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,440
Chief Jiang.

136
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,040
Xiao Man is not the murderer.

137
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,080
Uncle Yu.

138
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,200
Why are you here?

139
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,160
Let's talk about it later.

140
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,280
Xingyuan, listen to me.

141
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,360
Xiao Man has been fond of her uncle Fang since she was young.

142
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,240
It's impossible to kill him.

143
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,120
Xiaoman can't kill him like a dream.

144
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,160
Mr. Yu,

145
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,840
I understand how you feel.

146
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,600
But you can't

147
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,800
as evidence.

148
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,840
Am I right?

149
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,400
I'm not defending Xiao Man.

150
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,400
On the Dragon Boat Festival,

151
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,680
I went to deliver rice dumplings to Rumeng.

152
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,000
I heard a man talking through the door

153
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,560
A guest

154
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,920
That man...

155
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,480
is the real murderer.
