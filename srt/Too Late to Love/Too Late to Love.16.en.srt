1
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,680
He's here! He's here!

2
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,600
He's here! He's here! He's here! He's here! He's here!

3
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:55,960
It's him! It's him!

4
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,000
He's here. He's here. He's here. He's here.

5
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,239
How did you know?

6
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,920
I knew something was wrong with you when I sent you cakes.

7
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,039
And I saw you coming out of my brother's room.

8
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,480
Xingyuan.

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,720
Is there any misunderstanding?

10
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,320
I hope it's a misunderstanding too.

11
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,840
Then why did he go to Mengzhou

12
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,039
but lied to me that he didn’t.

13
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,039
and told Min Ja to lie that she didn't see him.

14
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,640
And

15
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,039
When my mother died,

16
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,160
when my mother died?

17
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,680
But he had no reason to hurt Auntie Lin.

18
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,479
He hated me so much.

19
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,560
and asked about my whereabouts.

20
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,520
And my mother

21
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,320
would never tell me.

22
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,280
It doesn't explain why he wanted to kill my father.

23
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,960
My brother and dad

24
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,840
than me and dad.

25
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,000
How could he be so cruel?

26
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,560
The inheritance

27
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,760
is not a small amount.

28
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,040
Don't worry.

29
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,160
My brother said he won't take a penny.

30
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,400
You can't say it like that. You can't do it.

31
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,680
Good.

32
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,840
Even if he's a hypocrite,

33
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,000
why didn't we just ask Mr. Xia to take you away?

34
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,120
At least he could get half of his inheritance.

35
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,280
What if half is too little for him?

36
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,680
You're right. You're right.

37
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,480
[you'll be together.] [You'll be together.]

38
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,520
"To be with you, to be with you." "To be with you."

39
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,400
and kill me.

40
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,280
he will get all his inheritance.

41
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,040
To be honest,

42
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,480
I still don't believe you would do that

43
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,480
But just in case.

44
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,560
Xingyuan.

45
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,200
No matter what you do,

46
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,800
you must protect yourself.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,640
You are my only family in this world.

48
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,360
You're my only family in this world.

49
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:57,920
[Three days later.] [Three days later.]

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,080
Three days later.

51
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,440
Already?

52
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,600
A lot has happened at home recently.

53
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,880
I think

54
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,560
we shouldn't hold a grand event.

55
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,560
Just let the family witness it.

56
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,880
I'm sorry.

57
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,360
Can't you wait?

58
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,720
Of course.

59
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,960
What if you run away?

60
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,160
No way.

61
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,720
Didn't we agree

62
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,920
until death separates us?

63
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,280
Although time is limited,

64
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,640
but we'll have everything we need.

65
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,120
All my money

66
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,480
belongs to you.

67
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,680
What a big sum.

68
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,000
Of course.

69
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,920
I don't want to leave my child.

70
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,160
There's no wolf in it.

71
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,120
The wolf will bite you.

72
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,960
I'm not afraid.

73
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,600
I regret it every day.

74
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,480
Regret?

75
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,920
I let you take the risk alone in the church.

76
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,760
I regret that I didn't dig three feet when I couldn't find you.

77
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,520
I regret seeing you again.

78
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,840
I'll shoot you with a gun.

79
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,560
I decided

80
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,400
for the rest of my life.

81
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,400
I'll cook for you

82
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,440
I'll cook for you.

83
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:53,880
I'm sick.

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,960
I'll be infected by you. Okay? Okay.

85
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,440
I'm old.

86
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,760
I'm your wheelchair.

87
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,720
I only have one thought now.

88
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,000
This is the rest of my life.

89
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,720
as soon as possible.

90
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,800
I've married you many times in my dream.

91
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,760
It's finally coming true.

92
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,880
If only my mother could see it.

93
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,360
if my mother could see it.

94
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,120
Director.

95
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,600
I've thought about it.

96
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,080
You have to tell Dr. Lin the truth.

97
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,040
Am I right?

98
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,960
Teach me then.

99
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,440
what I should say.

100
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,840
Xingyuan.

101
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,040
I did go to your mother's house that day.

102
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,480
I did have some misunderstandings with her.

103
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,840
I'll ask you one last time.

104
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,760
Where is Lin Xingyuan?

105
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,440
I'll answer you one last time.

106
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,320
I don't know.

107
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,880
Are you okay?

108
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,240
Let me take you to the hospital.

109
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,000
What a coincidence.

110
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,960
She fell down.

111
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,080
What a coincidence. She pulled my button off.

112
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,120
What a coincidence!

113
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,000
she broke her head and hit the wall.

114
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,600
What a coincidence.

115
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,159
the murderer must have killed her

116
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,960
by hitting the wall.

117
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,800
and catch the murderer.

118
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,159
I'll tell you everything.

119
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,280
Boss.

120
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,560
Did you get this medicine at your home?

121
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:26,920
No.

122
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,840
Now

123
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,120
Who are you?

124
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,559
Mr. Fang?

125
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,480
Does it have anything to do with you?

126
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,039
I tried to persuade Mr. Fang.

127
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,760
If you take the medicine, you’ll lose both your energy and blood.

128
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,120
I won't listen.

129
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,440
Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look

130
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,800
You can't afford to offend him.

131
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,760
Mr. Fang pretended to be sick for so many years.

132
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,080
Tell me.

133
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,160
What does he want?

134
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,160
You're here.

135
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,120
This is the key I secretly made.

136
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,920
When no one is around,

137
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,840
open it yourself.

138
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,200
You've suffered.

139
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,040
I'm fine.

140
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,240
Mother.

141
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,080
Yilin.

142
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,000
My mother is gone.

143
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,400
My father

144
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,160
on other women.

145
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,520
I don't have a home.

146
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,880
What should I do?

147
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,320
I was already like this.

148
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,640
I'm still alive.

149
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,840
Xiaoman.

150
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,560
Don't be afraid.

151
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,520
I'm here.

152
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,680
my home will be your home.

153
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,440
But I can't accept it.

154
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,400
Me too.

155
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,880
Xiao Man.

156
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,240
Help me.

157
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,920
Let's take back everything that belongs to us.

158
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,400
Wherever you go,

159
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,800
or what you do,

160
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,360
I'll be with you.

161
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,200
with you.

162
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,200
Lin Xingyuan is following you.

163
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,320
Go find Jiang Beichen.

164
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,640
You fought with her very passionately.

165
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,960
Have you forgotten that she's your sister?

166
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,840
If they get back together,

167
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,320
our plan may fail.

168
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,680
I think

169
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,520
Jiang Beichen wouldn't have

170
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,440
steal a woman from his brother.

171
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,600
No matter where you go,

172
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,760
or what you do,

173
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,280
I'll be with you.

174
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,640
I told you

175
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,680
no matter where you go,

176
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,440
wherever you go.

177
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,480
I'll be with you.
