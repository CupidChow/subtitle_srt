1
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,760
He's here! He's here! He's here!

2
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,240
He’s here. He’s here.

3
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,480
Xia Duoduo died in Fang’s Mansion.

4
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,800
I should give you an explanation.

5
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,760
But Xingyuan,

6
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,880
She is not the murderer.

7
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,480
There must be something wrong.

8
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,600
Jiang Beichen!

9
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,760
You just abandoned my daughter.

10
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,519
How dare you indulge that bitch?

11
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,240
Where is she? Where is she? She's here!

12
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,400
President.

13
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,000
This is sodium chloride.

14
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,360
a chronic poison.

15
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,320
If you don't inject the antidote within ten days,

16
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,120
You'll die! You'll die!

17
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,760
Come on. Come on.

18
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,520
Go! Go! Go!

19
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,640
No murderer

20
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,360
would kill someone with his own hairpin.

21
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,160
Then he called someone else to the crime scene.

22
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:33,759
Someone obviously framed him.

23
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,240
Xia Duoduo had a pneumothorax attack.

24
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:40,520
Dr. Lin had no choice but to puncture her with a hairpin.

25
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,280
Unexpectedly,

26
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,440
the murderer took advantage of it.

27
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,039
Ten days. Ten days.

28
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,200
Ten days. Ten days.

29
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,840
[I'll kill you in ten days.] [I'll kill you in ten days.]

30
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,759
I will catch the murderer.

31
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,600
and revenge for Xia Duoduo.

32
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,400
The president doesn’t want

33
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,400
the real culprit will be at large.

34
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,240
If we can't hand over the murderer,

35
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,520
I'll destroy the Fang family.

36
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,400
What is sodium chloride?

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,040
I've never heard of it.

38
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,640
Neither have I.

39
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,800
Just some insulin.

40
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,320
to reduce his blood sugar.

41
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,200
Just have a meal.

42
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,840
I have an idea.

43
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,760
But you need to be the bait.

44
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,720
It's not filial to say this,

45
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,200
but my father

46
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
diabetes.

47
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,280
I'm glad you're fine.

48
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,080
Didn't you apply the medicine?

49
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,920
Your medicine

50
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,680
doesn't seem to work.

51
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,560
How about this?

52
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,279
Not bad.

53
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,600
What about this?

54
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,360
I love you.

55
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,280
I love you to bicker with me.

56
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,560
I love your tenderness

57
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,159
Love you.

58
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,440
You're saving people with a scalpel.

59
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,040
Loving you is obviously taking the bullet for me.

60
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,480
You still won't admit it.

61
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:54,840
Even if

62
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,000
when I hate you the most,

63
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,160
I love you too.

64
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,240
What are you thinking

65
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,680
What are you thinking?

66
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,680
Who shot him?

67
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,800
He was with me two years ago.

68
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,640
and now in Fang Mansion.

69
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,840
who looks like me?

70
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,240
Could it be her?

71
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,280
[Yu Xiaoman?]

72
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,960
Yu Xiaoman?

73
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,800
We

74
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,280
to the tailor shop.

75
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,760
The boss said

76
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,920
the murderer had a red mole

77
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,840
on his left chest.

78
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,600
Don't worry.

79
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,520
I've asked someone to check it.

80
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,720
Yu Xiaoman's left chest.

81
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,240
No red mole.

82
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,800
Xiaoman is good at makeup.

83
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,840
It's too easy for her

84
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,000
is too easy for her.

85
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,280
Let me help you.

86
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,440
Do you remember when we were seven?

87
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,920
The fatty next door came to me again.

88
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,680
He said I was born to a dancer.

89
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,840
You rushed up without saying anything.

90
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,440
and broke an arm.

91
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:53,920
Later,

92
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,480
I made braids for you for three months.

93
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,720
How can you not remember?

94
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,680
That was your first fight.

95
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,640
There are many first times.

96
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:06,920
First time?

97
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,720
you took me to eat western food.

98
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,520
At that time,

99
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,080
We were like one person.

100
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,360
Oh.

101
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,280
Oh, right. And...

102
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,560
my first time abroad.

103
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,880
At that time,

104
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,480
my mother used stitches for others

105
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,760
to do laundry.

106
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,440
I saved up all my savings

107
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,440
I didn't get any change.

108
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,840
Uncle Yu sent the money here without blinking.

109
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,200
And you.

110
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,600
took two tickets

111
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,400
to go with me.

112
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:51,840
I'll go with you.

113
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,200
Don't you want to go to Shanghai the most?

114
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,280
But there are so many bad people abroad.

115
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,840
What if you get bullied?

116
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,680
At that time, I thought

117
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,520
no matter what happens in the future,

118
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,880
I will never betray you.

119
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:15,920
Me too.

120
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,880
Then why did you frame me?

121
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,280
Frame me?

122
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,560
You want to kill me?

123
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:24,960
Xingyuan.

124
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,120
Are you still blaming me for telling Mr. Xia

125
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,320
that you were in the eastern suburbs?

126
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,040
I was forced.

127
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,760
Stop pretending.

128
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,280
You shot Beichen two years ago.

129
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,880
It was you who killed Master Fang and Xia Duoduo.

130
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,000
The evidence is

131
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,640
the mole on your chest.

132
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,480
I just don't understand, Xiaoman.

133
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,000
Why?

134
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,240
Blame

135
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,840
your shameless mother
