1
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:39,920
Brother! Brother!

2
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,160
Brother!

3
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,720
Brother, you can't take Dr. Lin away.

4
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,880
She just recovered.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,720
She can't stand a cell.

6
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,560
Don't you like her?

7
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,560
How could you watch her die?

8
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,680
You finally came in handy.

9
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,000
Brother,

10
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,400
I think it’s the same person who killed Xia Duoduo and Master Fang.

11
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,480
They wanted to frame me

12
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,720
to kill me.

13
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,800
From the moment I went to get the medicine box to the garden,

14
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,000
it won't take more than five minutes.

15
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,280
If he could kill him in such a short time,

16
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,000
the murderer must be in the Fang family.

17
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,960
He has been watching me closely.

18
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,680
Yes.

19
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,200
Look at it. Look at it.

20
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,120
Right.

21
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,000
Why would Chief Jiang believe me?

22
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,759
It doesn't matter whether I believe you or not.

23
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,480
What matters is what Mr. Xia thinks.

24
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,760
Trust me.

25
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,400
Come on. Come on.

26
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,120
Get off the car! Get off the car!

27
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,400
Leave Rong City.

28
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,840
If this case is not closed,

29
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,440
don't come back.

30
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,360
I'm not leaving.

31
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,960
I can't run away because I'm afraid of punishment.

32
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,079
I must find out who is trying to kill me.

33
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,200
I'll handle this case.

34
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,640
Take care of yourself.

35
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,120
Put me down.

36
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,720
If the murderer can hurt you twice, he can hurt you for the third time.

37
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,920
Do you think you're always so lucky?

38
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,000
None of your business.

39
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,440
You have to die, right?

40
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,640
The police station is not surnamed Xia.

41
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,240
Even the president has to follow the rules.

42
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,800
Lin Xingyuan.

43
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,680
Don't be so naive.

44
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,920
Not only the police,

45
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,400
The Shark Gang belongs to him.

46
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,640
He wants to kill you

47
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,800
There are 10,000 ways.

48
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,480
to avenge my mother.

49
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,000
The person who framed me

50
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,960
must be the one who killed my mother.

51
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,640
Besides,

52
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,440
I'm leaving.

53
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,240
What will you do?

54
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,520
Jiang Beichen!

55
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,480
Jiang Beichen, let me out!

56
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,360
When the murderer is caught,

57
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,840
I'll let you out.

58
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,760
I'm hungry. I want to eat.

59
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,520
Why are they all Yuan Yun?

60
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,120
What's wrong? You don't like it?

61
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,800
I want meat.

62
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,120
Okay.

63
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,520
I'll borrow you a chicken next door.

64
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,160
I don't eat chicken.

65
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,920
At times like this,

66
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,640
where can I get you another meat?

67
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,120
Okay.

68
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,760
Wait

69
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,000
Can we eat now?

70
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,200
Your tea leaves are all wet.

71
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,520
I'll buy a new one tomorrow.

72
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,760
I like bed.

73
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm not used to the bed here.

74
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200
Lin Xingyuan.

75
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,840
Are you done?

76
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,800
Just let me go.

77
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,560
Don't you dare! I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

78
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,800
Okay.

79
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,640
Go upstairs and take down Dr. Lin's quilt.

80
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,600
I'll send it to you myself.

81
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,760
Be careful.

82
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:18,720
Okay.

83
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,880
Where are they?

84
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,720
Don't worry.

85
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,960
The old house in the eastern suburbs.

86
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:26,680
Let's go.

87
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,360
Where are we going?

88
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,200
I'll give you a ride.

89
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,960
To the dessert shop.

90
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,960
Snacks

91
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,640
Put some snacks in the quilt.

92
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,240
So creative.

93
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:38,920
No.

94
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,120
Go to the cloth store.

95
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:40,800
Cloth store?

96
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,640
This is Fang Mansion,

97
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,920
not the police station.

98
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,200
Do you want to die?

99
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,520
Not bad.

100
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,080
Of course.

101
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,040
You

102
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,560
stay here.

103
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,680
I'll cook for you every day.

104
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,680
Beat him!

105
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,760
It won't last long.

106
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,480
Ten minutes.

107
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,400
Hand me over! You're dead! You're dead!

108
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,880
you can still live.

109
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,760
Mr. Xia,

110
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,120
brought the Shark Gang.

111
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,040
He didn't plan to let anyone leave.

112
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,080
Anyway,

113
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm going to die.

114
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,720
Let me ask you a question.

115
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,240
Answer me honestly.

116
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,520
What do you mean?

117
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,680
Two years ago,

118
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,160
Why did you betray me?

119
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,960
I can only stop the bleeding.

120
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,440
This won't do.

121
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,080
My classmate lives nearby.

122
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,560
I'll go get a medical kit and be right back.

123
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:55,760
No.

124
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,520
Don't go! Don't go!

125
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,720
It's dangerous outside.

126
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,640
We need to get the bullet out.

127
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,240
Or the wound will get infected.

128
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,000
Don't worry.

129
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,080
Wait for me.

130
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,600
Xingyuan.

131
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,240
You're back.

132
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,800
I...

133
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,800
I betrayed you.

134
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,120
What a thief!

135
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,840
I went back when I borrowed the medicine box.

136
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,400
Who knows?

137
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,880
near the church.

138
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,680
near the church.

139
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,560
I lied that you were somewhere else

140
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,800
I lied that you were somewhere else and distracted him.

141
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,960
So...

142
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,720
You didn't shoot me.

143
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,160
Then who shot me?

144
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,360
Anyway,

145
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,800
Luckily someone passed by.

146
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,720
I survived.

147
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,560
And then?

148
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,080
I couldn't find you anywhere.

149
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,160
Where did you go?

150
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,360
I lied to them. How could they let me go?

151
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,880
I stayed in the interrogation room for a whole month.

152
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,440
I couldn't hold on any longer.

153
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,760
But they suddenly let me go.

154
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,320
They said I was useless.

155
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,400
You abandoned me

156
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,960
and went back to get engaged.

157
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,000
An engagement?

158
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,480
was my father's idea.

159
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,160
After you left,

160
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,960
I was disappointed.

161
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,440
so I let it be.

162
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,560
Open the door.

163
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,240
Open the door!

164
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,360
Open the door.

165
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,800
Are you scared?

166
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,560
Open the door.

167
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,840
Open it.

168
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,680
I'm not scared now.

169
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,520
Open the door.
