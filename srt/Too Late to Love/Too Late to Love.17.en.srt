1
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,400
You've suffered a lot.

2
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,040
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

3
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,720
I said I'll go wherever you go.

4
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,440
No matter where you go, I'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be there soon. I'll be there soon.

5
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,400
wherever you go.

6
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,360
I'll be with you. Okay.

7
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,920
What's wrong?

8
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,360
Xiao Man, you know what?

9
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,080
My father didn't like me since I was young.

10
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,200
My mother thought I was useless.

11
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,720
and scolded me.

12
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,479
I remember when I was six,

13
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,960
she pushed me into the pond

14
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,880
she pushed me into the pond.

15
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,960
I can't swim.

16
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,039
I almost drowned.

17
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,240
After being saved,

18
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,200
I had a fever for three days.

19
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,680
My father finally came to see me.

20
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,800
Do you know how happy I was?

21
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,880
So, whenever I was sick,

22
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,960
he would care about me.

23
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,200
Since that day,

24
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,480
I often pretended to be sick.

25
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,280
Pretend to be sick.

26
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,680
It becomes a habit.

27
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,079
But today I realized

28
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,280
no matter how hard I try,

29
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,680
I can't get their love.

30
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,960
But at least,

31
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,720
I want his money.

32
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,640
Xiao Man.

33
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,120
If I say I want to kill him,

34
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,520
will you blame me?

35
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,760
Do you think I'm crazy?

36
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,960
Do you think I'm useless?

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,960
I think

38
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,360
your illness

39
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,880
is your best protection color.

40
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,280
Wherever you go,

41
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,240
wherever you go.

42
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,360
I'll be with you.

43
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,360
Don't worry.

44
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,080
Tomorrow,

45
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,840
I'll get everything back to us.

46
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,400
Director.

47
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,440
What are you doing?

48
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,280
Why did you carve a chicken on such a happy day?

49
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,760
This is mandarin duck

50
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,320
It's like this. It's like this.

51
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,960
It's like a chicken. It's like a chicken.

52
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Look at the wings.

53
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,560
It's like this.

54
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,440
The feathers

55
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,560
is so vivid.

56
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,760
It's so vivid.

57
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,800
Young Master, have some snacks.

58
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,560
Come on. Come on.

59
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,080
It's here.

60
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,840
It's like this.

61
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,800
It is

62
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,520
It's here.

63
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,320
"Look at your eyes."

64
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,480
"Look at your eyes." "Look at your eyes."

65
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,440
It's not your fault.

66
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,080
Young Master.

67
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,040
I can't see clearly from this distance.

68
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,720
I must be blind.

69
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,040
Tell me where you bought it.

70
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,080
I'll scold him for you.

71
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:56,440
It's so ugly.

72
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,840
How dare you sell it?

73
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,159
If I were Dr. Lin,

74
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,800
I wouldn't want to marry him.

75
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,520
I made it.

76
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,720
This one

77
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,960
At first glance,

78
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,120
It's a chicken

79
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,800
Take a closer look

80
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,920
They are mandarin ducks. Yes, they are.

81
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:15,920
Director Jiang.

82
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,040
Congratulations.

83
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,520
Mr. Yu.

84
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,240
Can I help you

85
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,440
Can I help you?

86
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,240
By the way,

87
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,480
Mr. Yu,

88
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,720
Look at this.

89
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,360
I'm old.

90
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,600
I don't understand you young people.

91
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,440
What?

92
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,760
Getting married now

93
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,240
Is it popular to use chicken

94
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,080
Yes.

95
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:51,800
Xingyuan.

96
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,480
Look.

97
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,720
What is this?

98
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,360
Mandarin ducks.

99
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,640
Do you really think this is mandarin ducks?

100
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,360
Not mandarin ducks.

101
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,840
Is it chicken?

102
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,200
You're right.

103
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:06,920
It's good. It's good.

104
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,160
Touch it.

105
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,720
I carved this myself.

106
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,400
I heard it from someone. It's a new one.

107
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,080
Newbies

108
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,040
Just carve the mandarin ducks

109
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,400
you can

110
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,560
forever.

111
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,560
The mandarin ducks only stay together during the mating period.

112
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,520
After the matching,

113
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,840
The male bird turned around and left.

114
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,080
Actually, I carved a chicken.

115
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,280
The dragon and the phoenix are auspicious, okay?

116
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:38,720
No need.

117
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,760
Everything is the same.

118
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,560
It's all superstition.

119
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,840
How is this feudal superstition?

120
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,240
This is faith.

121
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:52,800
You

122
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,240
is my faith.

123
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:33,520
Here.

124
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:44,680
Brother.

125
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,240
It's your wedding tomorrow.

126
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,200
You're still up?

127
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,480
It'll be ready soon.

128
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,800
Xingyuan.

129
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,560
Lucky.

130
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,360
I'm the lucky one.

131
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,480
Yilin,

132
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,200
Do you have anything to tell me?

133
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,400
Tell me now.

134
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,040
It's not too late.

135
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,680
Here.

136
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,600
I wish you

137
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,800
can always be so lucky.

138
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,640
Thank you.

139
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,240
Thank you.

140
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,080
Dr. Lin.

141
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,760
It's time.
