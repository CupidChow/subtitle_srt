1
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,040
Why did you go up?

2
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,000
Come down.

3
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,039
I don't understand.

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,480
Be good.

5
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,480
Let's go. Let's go.

6
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,400
No.

7
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:18,920
I don't want to think about it.

8
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,680
Think for me. Okay.

9
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:23,800
Okay.

10
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,120
Let's go. Let's go.

11
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:25,800
Come on.

12
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:26,880
Let's get down first.

13
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,080
If you don't think it right,

14
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,840
I won't go down.

15
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:36,920
I promise you.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Xiao Man said

17
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,560
[It's a button.] [It's a button.]

18
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,800
It's a button.

19
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,360
It was on your black coat.

20
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,800
But I saw it.

21
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,400
your coat doesn't lack a button.

22
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,640
What's going on?

23
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,920
Maybe she saw this button

24
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:59,080
on my clothes.

25
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,240
Did you say that on purpose?

26
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,680
Isn't this kind of button

27
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,880
is common.

28
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,120
Where were you

29
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:10,840
Where are you?

30
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,520
I'm here. I'm here.

31
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,760
I'm working on a case.

32
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,320
There was a murder in the east suburb.

33
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,560
Really?

34
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,480
Really.

35
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,640
Come on, let's get down first.

36
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,320
They hold it steadily.

37
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,000
Turn around and put it down.

38
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,360
Why are you on the floor?

39
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,240
Am I too heavy?

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,680
In operas, you jump from three to four meters high.

41
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,160
Find a high place to get drunk.

42
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,960
You just think I'm heavy.

43
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,960
I'm not.

44
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,240
Hold me. Okay.

45
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:55,400
Be good.

46
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,000
Come on. Come on.

47
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,520
Let's go.

48
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,560
The moon is nice.

49
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,840
I want to see the moon.

50
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,880
Go home first.

51
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,480
There's no moonlight.

52
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,320
You can go back now.

53
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,800
Why are you so silly?

54
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,720
I'm fine.

55
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,360
Beichen.

56
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,320
I believe you won't lie to me.

57
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,920
Be careful.

58
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,440
Be careful.

59
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,280
Don't open your eyes.

60
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:17,920
Okay.

61
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,520
Do you want to try?

62
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,720
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,240
I've never worn it before.

64
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,040
Is it pretty?

65
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,880
Yes.

66
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,880
Marry me.

67
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,520
You don't even have a ring.

68
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,360
I won't marry him.

69
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,720
Bronze.

70
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,200
You're so poor.

71
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,200
Take a closer look.

72
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,240
This is...

73
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,400
A bullet!

74
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,840
It's the bullet you took for me.

75
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,480
Xingyuan.

76
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,360
I swear

77
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,120
I will never let a bullet pass me.

78
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,640
I'll hit you.

79
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,760
I haven't said I'm willing.

80
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,680
I've been waiting for two years.

81
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,600
I don't want to wait anymore.

82
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,200
Xingyuan.

83
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,360
Will you marry me?

84
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,159
Yes.

85
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,800
Yilin.

86
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,200
The world changes so fast.

87
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,280
I was sad about you and my brother.

88
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,440
Then you became my sister.

89
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,560
Now you're my sister-in-law.

90
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,040
Are you okay?

91
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,600
I'm fine. I'm fine.

92
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,160
From now on,

93
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,920
I'll be your brother.

94
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,400
You are my sister-in-law.

95
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,360
By the way,

96
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,320
I heard you like green bean cakes.

97
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,680
Isn't this my hometown's specialty?

98
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,200
Did you go to Mengzhou?

99
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,240
No.

100
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,400
My brother brought it back from Mengzhou a while ago.

101
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,200
When did he go to Mengzhou?

102
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
On the Dragon Boat Festival.

103
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,960
The color is different.

104
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,400
It was stitched from behind.

105
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,520
I've frightened Aunt Zhao.

106
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,800
Miss Lin won't see her again.

107
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,200
And that Yu Xiaoman.

108
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,720
Watch carefully.

109
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,840
Don't let her talk nonsense.

110
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:35,720
Don't worry, Director.

111
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,080
If she leaks a word,

112
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,520
you'll break my head too.

113
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,440
What are you talking about?

114
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,960
Wait for the car.

115
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,000
I'll come after I get changed.

116
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,120
If she leaks a word,

117
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,120
you'll break my head too.

118
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,440
and my head.
