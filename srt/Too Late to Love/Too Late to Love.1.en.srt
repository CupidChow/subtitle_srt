1
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,240
It smells like a bug.

2
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,680
Miss Xia, do you like it too?

3
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,120
A boar can't eat fine glutinous rice.

4
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:58,720
Give it to me.

5
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,360
Yuan Yun!

6
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,360
Let go of my father.

7
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,600
Put down your gun first.

8
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,480
Xingyuan.

9
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,039
You are back.

10
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:36,000
Mr. Jiang.

11
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,320
Long time no see.

12
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,520
This is the lower artery of the collarbone.

13
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,320
It only takes 3.5 seconds.

14
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,120
I'll send you to hell.

15
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,759
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

16
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,600
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

17
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:02,720
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

18
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,480
You brat.

19
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,560
Don't you dare touch Dr. Lin! I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

20
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,400
I'm not done with you!

21
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,840
She wants to harm you.

22
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,080
There's a poison in my chest.

23
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,600
Dr. Lin is taking care of it for me.

24
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,480
Look at you.

25
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,800
You just came in.

26
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,960
Apologize to Dr. Lin.

27
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,360
Apologize to her.

28
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,760
I'm afraid she can't accept it.

29
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,079
You...

30
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:30,800
It's okay.

31
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,960
I understand.

32
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,160
Mr. Jiang is worried about you.

33
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,960
Brat.

34
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,360
You're a police chief.

35
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,280
Get out.

36
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,960
Get out! Get out!

37
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,079
Go.

38
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,200
Go. Go.

39
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,760
Come on. Come on.

40
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,680
Let's go. Okay.

41
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,960
It's okay.

42
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,320
The poison has been taken care of.

43
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,400
Don't get wet these days.

44
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,480
Don't eat spicy and spicy food.

45
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,360
Dr. Lin.

46
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,240
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

47
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,440
As long as I'm here,

48
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,720
No one will bully you again.

49
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,880
Master Fang.

50
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,640
I don’t need your protection.

51
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,560
Lin Xingyuan.

52
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,640
Do you really think I dare not kill you?

53
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,400
Murder is illegal.

54
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,280
The law of Rong City

55
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,960
is not surnamed Jiang.

56
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,960
What's your relationship with my father?

57
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,400
As you can see,

58
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,360
Family doctors and patients

59
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,519
That simple?

60
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,800
What do you think?

61
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,720
I’m asking you now.

62
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,240
To be honest,

63
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,800
To be honest,

64
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,000
it's none of your business.

65
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,240
Let go of me!

66
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,560
You hurt me.

67
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,800
Your father will be sad.

68
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,760
Lin Xingyuan.

69
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,800
I want to fill my father's room.

70
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,200
Dream on!

71
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,240
It's none of your business.

72
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,000
Why did you...

73
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:47,960
Brother, let go!

74
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,560
Brother, what are you doing?

75
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,440
Young Master.

76
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,280
Chief Jiang is really sick.

77
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,120
I'll check on him for you next time.

78
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,040
Next time.

79
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,440
You won't be so lucky next time.

80
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,960
Let's go.

81
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,200
I'll use it.

82
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,040
I'll do it myself.

83
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,600
This one

84
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,720
It's under the armpit.

85
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,040
Under the armpit

86
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,320
Come on.

87
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,720
Your cough is weak.

88
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,360
but it's not as bad as pneumonia.

89
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,680
Then why doesn't the medicine

90
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,880
doesn't work on you?

91
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,760
It's an old problem.

92
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,000
It's not easy to recover.

93
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,160
Besides, it's much better

94
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,600
I'm much better now.

95
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,760
Dr. Lin.

96
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,600
Did something happen

97
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,400
Did something happen before?

98
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,440
Hurry!

99
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,120
Stop! Hurry!

100
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:44,920
You...

101
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,600
Did you see a guy in black?

102
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
in black?

103
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,400
Get out of the way!

104
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,280
Get him! Get him! Get him!

105
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:51,920
Go after them!

106
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,560
Yes.

107
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,240
Wait.

108
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,760
Help me.

109
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,240
Help me!

110
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,520
Otherwise,

111
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,040
you can't leave.

112
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,360
He owes me a life.

113
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,520
Just kidding.

114
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,280
Just kidding.

115
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:37,800
Bothermometer.

116
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,000
Dr. Lin.

117
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,840
You're still here at this hour?

118
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,760
Why are you still here at this hour?

119
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,720
What are you doing, Dr. Lin?

120
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,400
Master.

121
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:22,760
Murder!

122
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,120
Murder!

123
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,360
Murder!

124
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,080
Master!

125
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,840
Father.

126
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,720
Secretary Wu.

127
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,760
Send Yilin back to her room.

128
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:54,840
Yes.

129
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,760
Don't worry.

130
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,120
I will make the murderer pay with his blood.
