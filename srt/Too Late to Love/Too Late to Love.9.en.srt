1
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,560
Brother Beichen

2
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,760
Why did you bring me here?

3
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,360
You hurt me.

4
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,440
Who is this?

5
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,760
I don't know her.

6
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,640
Lock her up!

7
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,880
Brother Beichen.

8
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,120
Can you stop making such jokes?

9
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,800
I'm scared.

10
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,080
It's not good.

11
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,920
She's Mr. Xia's daughter.

12
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,800
and your fiancée.

13
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,200
Not anymore.

14
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,160
You'd better pray

15
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,200
Lin Xingyuan is fine.

16
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,080
I said,

17
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm putting the ointment on you.

18
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,720
Do you believe me?

19
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,320
It's done. It's done.

20
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,560
Yes.

21
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,280
Can I get up now?

22
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,800
Why did you save me?

23
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,440
No.

24
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,480
I wanted to push you away,

25
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,520
but I made a mistake.

26
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,960
You can lie to me.

27
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,640
I still owe you one.

28
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,200
Do you want to owe me a favor?

29
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,200
What about you?

30
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,520
Why did you come to save me?

31
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,720
He kidnapped me in my territory.

32
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,200
I have to take care of him.

33
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,640
You can lie to me too.

34
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,920
and let me owe you a favor.

35
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,520
But what I want

36
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,280
is never a favor.

37
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:30,960
You must be hungry.

38
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,680
I'll get you something to eat.

39
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,840
Let me do it.

40
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,160
I'll do it.

41
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,079
Don't you need to go to the police station?

42
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,720
I'll take care of Dr. Lin.

43
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,160
Yilin,

44
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,160
You're not feeling well.

45
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,960
Don't work too hard.

46
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,960
Go back and rest.

47
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,640
Leave it to me.

48
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,800
I'm fine.

49
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,480
If you're tired,

50
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,600
go back and rest.

51
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,400
I'm injured.

52
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,640
I'm not disabled.

53
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,880
I can do it myself.

54
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,520
Eat up.

55
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,760
A thank you for taking my bullet.

56
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,880
Are you sure this is repaying me?

57
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,560
It's not revenge.

58
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:50,800
Director.

59
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,640
I told you you have bad taste.

60
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,200
You don't believe me?

61
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,440
It's just a hairpin.

62
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,880
Why do you need it?

63
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,960
I don't want to look good.

64
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,400
Is it to show off?

65
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,680
No.

66
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,160
Those good-looking things in the market

67
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,280
are all shackles.

68
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,960
This one.

69
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,520
It's a secret.

70
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,280
That's more suitable.

71
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,680
I knew it.

72
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,560
you wouldn't have

73
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,200
in these days.

74
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,000
Ms. Oh.

75
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,120
Hello.

76
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,560
Have you finished the case? Yes.

77
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,000
No.

78
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,760
What are you doing here?

79
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,840
Got it.

80
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,920
I’ll leave now.

81
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,440
If you don't like it, I'll leave it to you. Okay.

82
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,320
then forget it.

83
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,840
Since you've done it,

84
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,080
I'll

85
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,080
accept it.

86
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,840
No.

87
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,280
Let me put it on you.

88
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,320
It's pretty.

89
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,680
It suits you.

90
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,240
Lin Xingyuan.

91
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,640
Wait and see.

92
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,680
Lin Xingyuan, you bitch!

93
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,520
Tell me.

94
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,800
Did you force Brother Beichen to break off the engagement with me?

95
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,000
You can do it on your own.

96
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,600
Do I have to do it?

97
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,080
Don't get cocky too soon.

98
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,760
When Brother Beichen gets tired of you,

99
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,240
he will come back to me.

100
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:36,960
Okay.

101
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,400
Just wait at home.

102
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,840
Why are you here?

103
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,159
You...

104
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,760
I can give Brother Beichen everything he wants.

105
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,159
What can you give him?

106
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,400
I'm everything he wants.

107
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,280
You're shameless.

108
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,240
Speaking of which, I should thank Miss Xia

109
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,320
Otherwise, Beichen and I wouldn't have reunited so soon.

110
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,600
You must come on our wedding day.

111
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,000
I'll arrange for you to take a seat.

112
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,600
Just like your mother,

113
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,080
You're all marinated.

114
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,800
What a sin!

115
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,000
Eldest Young Master and Second Young Master

116
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,360
are interested in Dr. Lin.

117
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,480
Dr. Lin and Miss Xia

118
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,240
both like Eldest Young Master.

119
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,280
Miss Xia wants Dr. Lin and Young Master

120
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,680
to be mature

121
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,400
to help her and Young Master.

122
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,880
In the end,

123
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,560
Dr. Lin and Young Master got familiar with each other.

124
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,560
It's too messy. I need to sort it out.

125
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,960
The melons in our mansion are mainly about a large quantity.

126
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,840
It depends on how it ends.

127
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,080
Say it again.

128
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,960
I won’t say it.

129
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,280
Xia Duoduo.

130
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,560
Xia Duoduo, what’s wrong?

131
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,600
Xia Duoduo.

132
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,080
Help me.

133
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:51,960
Don't worry.

134
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,920
I will save you.

135
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,760
Oh my god! Someone is dead!

136
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,120
Wait for me. I'll get the medicine kit.

137
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,040
Miss.

138
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,160
Miss, wake up!

139
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,240
Please wake up.

140
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:42,840
It's her.

141
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,280
She killed Miss Xia.

142
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,840
I saw it clearly.

143
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,040
They saw it too.

144
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,720
That's right.

145
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,680
She had a tense pneumothorax.

146
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,360
I used a hairpin

147
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,400
I'm sure she's fine now.

148
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,680
What's going on?

149
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,920
I know.

150
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,040
Someone must have mended the knife after I left.

151
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,680
It must be like this.

152
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,080
Stop pretending.

153
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,480
You two were so fierce.

154
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,000
We heard you fighting and killing each other.

155
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,480
My lady

156
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,600
wants you to return Chief Jiang to her.

157
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,760
Why did you do that?

158
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,480
We have witness and evidence.

159
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,240
What are you waiting for?

160
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,240
Are you protecting the murderer?
