1
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,840
Mr. Fang and I are not like that.

2
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,600
I said that last time

3
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,120
just to piss you off.

4
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,880
In my life,

5
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,200
in my life.

6
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,800
Try it.

7
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,920
I don't mean to hurt anyone.

8
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,320
I don't need a gun.

9
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,640
I hope you're holding flowers.

10
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,640
not a gun.

11
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,039
It's rouge in your bag.

12
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,640
not bullets.

13
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,200
We're in chaos.

14
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,160
We are innocent.

15
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,200
If you didn't shoot,

16
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,720
What if someone shot you?

17
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,640
I'm not afraid.

18
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,280
You'll protect me.

19
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,080
What if

20
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,560
someone shot me?

21
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:37,640
Then...

22
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,640
I'll stay away.

23
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,200
You're so good.

24
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,479
You'll be fine.

25
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:47,520
Come on.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,680
Try it.

27
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,880
Here.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,200
Adjust your breathing.

29
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,960
Aim at the target.

30
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,960
Count.

31
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,560
How is it?

32
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,720
Easy, right?

33
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,160
Try it yourself.

34
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,720
Isn't this...

35
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,560
It hurts.

36
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,200
It hurts.

37
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,720
Of course it hurts.

38
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,560
Does it still hurt?

39
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,360
Jiang Beichen.

40
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,680
I beg you.

41
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,280
Please trust me.

42
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,320
The person who tripped twice by a stone

43
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,920
is a fool.

44
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,400
You don't eat it when it's soft.

45
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,640
You haven't changed at all.

46
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,760
Mrs. Wang.

47
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,680
Kill ten chickens.

48
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,720
Ten chickens.

49
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,519
Young Master.

50
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,200
Is there a guest coming?

51
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,760
I want chicken head soup.

52
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,080
Okay.

53
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,920
I'll kill the chicken for you.

54
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,400
Young Master, why are you here?

55
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,159
Director.

56
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,159
I told you.

57
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,159
Mrs. Wang's eyes

58
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,760
in her eyes.

59
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,440
Secretary Oh.

60
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,280
Young Master.

61
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,360
I have poor eyesight.

62
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,560
But it doesn't hinder my work.

63
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,560
Don't kick me out.

64
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,680
Get up.

65
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,560
Your turn.

66
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,680
I just want the truth.

67
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,880
On the day my father was killed,

68
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,640
did you really see the murderer was Lin Xingyuan?

69
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,480
He looks exactly like her.

70
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,880
It's just that...

71
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,480
I didn't see her face.

72
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,240
So,

73
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,280
you suspect someone is pretending to be you?

74
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,240
No.

75
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,080
I'm sure.

76
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:30,920
This guy

77
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,280
He's like me.

78
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,760
And

79
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,880
you know a lot about my living habits.

80
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,240
No.

81
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,040
It's you, isn't it?

82
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,200
That's right.

83
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,120
It's me.

84
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,240
All right, Xiao Man.

85
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,360
I'll stop messing with you.

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,920
You are the closest person in the world.

87
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,960
I don't doubt myself.

88
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,160
I know.

89
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,560
But there's one thing

90
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,320
I have to admit to you.

91
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,600
that you killed Uncle Fang.

92
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,640
Because you told me before

93
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,600
you would take Auntie Lin abroad to enjoy her life.

94
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,720
But you abandoned your great future abroad

95
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,560
to introduce you to Fang Mansion

96
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,880
to be an ordinary family doctor.

97
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,040
Don't tell me it's because of me.

98
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,920
I don't believe it.

99
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,360
I didn't kill Master Fang.

100
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:34,920
But

101
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,360
I came for him.

102
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,159
Two months ago,

103
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,000
I went back to Mengzhou to pick up my mother.

104
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:45,880
[I'm here to pick my mother up.] I'm here.

105
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,000
Mother!

106
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,040
Mother!

107
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,760
Mother.

108
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,040
What does this have to do with you entering Fang Mansion?

109
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,800
I asked someone to investigate.

110
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,640
Before my mother passed away,

111
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,680
Master Fang often came to see her.

112
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,080
On the day of my mother's funeral,

113
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,200
he came too.

114
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,960
He cried so sadly.

115
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,560
It's not normal to be sad.

116
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,400
So,

117
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,880
you suspect Uncle Fang killed Aunt Lin?

118
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,080
I don't know.

119
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,520
I just started investigating.

120
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,600
he died.

121
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,800
Then the clues are all gone.

122
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,360
My mother left me another clue.

123
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,720
Before my mother died,

124
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,960
she was holding this button tightly.

125
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,240
It must be left by the murderer.

126
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,720
But it's too hard to find the murderer

127
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,120
It's too hard.

128
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,600
No matter how hard it is,

129
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,640
I must find the murderer

130
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,640
and avenge my mother.

131
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,480
You're free.

132
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,679
You believe I'm innocent.

133
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,440
I see.

134
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,440
If I go out,

135
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,559
the murderer will definitely target me.

136
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,840
By then,

137
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,520
the mantis will catch the turtle.

138
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,640
Director Jiang, you're really something.

139
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,440
So are you leaving or not?

140
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,560
I hope we can work well together.
