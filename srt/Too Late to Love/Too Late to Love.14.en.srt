1
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:12,600
Come here. Come here.

2
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,680
Are you okay?

3
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,720
I'm fine.

4
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:15,880
Let's go. Let's go.

5
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,560
I'll do it myself.

6
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,280
Who let you out?

7
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,160
I miss you so much. I miss you so much.

8
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,400
I miss you so much. I miss you so much.

9
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,680
Secretary Wu,

10
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,280
I've already blamed Uncle Fang and Xia Duoduo's death

11
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,759
the death of Uncle Fang and Xia Duoduo.

12
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,200
The Fang family's property

13
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,880
It should belong to you.

14
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,880
Xiao Man.

15
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,360
Are you crazy? Are you crazy? Yes.

16
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,000
Brother Beichen.

17
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,160
Are you still mad at me for what happened two years ago?

18
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,560
I love you so much.

19
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,560
because I love you so much.

20
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,240
That's why I acted on impulse.

21
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,800
I almost killed you.

22
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,880
I'm sorry, Brother Beichen.

23
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,960
Please forgive me.

24
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,880
You're crazy.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,280
I killed people for you

26
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,680
and took the blame for you.

27
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,840
I'll risk my life for you

28
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,880
Can't you show your sincerity?

29
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,480
Brother Beichen.

30
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,600
You really let me down.

31
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,800
Aren't you afraid

32
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,200
I'll tell Lin Xingyuan

33
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,640
you killed her parents.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,880
Do you think

35
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,160
Lin Xingyuan will believe you?

36
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,120
I have evidence.

37
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,000
The button she was holding when her mother died

38
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,480
was on the black coat that Uncle Fang gave you.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,840
You want to die?

40
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,240
Don't slander me.

41
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,000
Wait and see.

42
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,880
Beichen, time to eat.

43
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,720
Wait in the restaurant.

44
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,920
I'll be there soon.

45
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,360
Hurry up.

46
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,600
What are you doing?

47
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,760
It's your birthday soon.

48
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,000
I want to make you a new dress.

49
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,480
comparing your old clothes.

50
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,720
I wanted to give you a surprise.

51
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,120
I didn't expect that

52
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,400
I'm here. I'm here.

53
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,160
Then I'll just...

54
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,920
Pretend you didn't see me.

55
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,480
I don't like to cover up.

56
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,480
He's right here.

57
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,560
What clothes are you measuring?

58
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:15,960
Come here.

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,120
Just measure me.

60
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,200
Even if the button is the same,

61
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,720
it can't prove that it's on this shirt.

62
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,120
You seem

63
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,120
interested in my clothes.

64
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,680
Is it

65
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,680
It's not on this shirt.

66
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,080
What do you think?

67
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,200
Is it nice?

68
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,160
Yes.

69
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,520
Beichen.

70
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,040
Will you blame me?

71
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,760
It's your fault.

72
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,840
Why?

73
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,800
Father left all his inheritance to me.

74
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,080
I heard

75
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,880
Father values you the most.

76
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,360
and wants you to inherit the Fang family.

77
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,520
But why did he suddenly change his mind

78
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,560
He didn't leave you any money.

79
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,360
Why else?

80
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,640
I brought it up myself.

81
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,520
I can make money myself.

82
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,320
Why should I fight for inheritance?

83
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,720
What are you going to do with Xiaoman?

84
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,480
Lock her

85
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,440
Lock her up!

86
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,120
What should we do?

87
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,360
Mr. Xia is still waiting.

88
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,200
You're asking her to die.

89
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,680
If we leave her here,

90
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,960
to catch the big fish behind the scenes.

91
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,760
If I could, I would have.

92
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,800
Why are you in such a hurry?

93
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,120
Yu Xiaoman

94
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,560
is a crazy woman.

95
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,880
She might bite people randomly.

96
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,400
You haven't seen my mother, have you?

97
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,640
I'll ask you one last time.

98
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,560
Where is Lin Xingyuan?

99
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,360
I'll answer you one last time.

100
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,840
I don't know.

101
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,120
It's a pity that

102
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,080
You've been looking for me for two years.

103
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,680
Don't you want to ask my mother?

104
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,760
She wouldn't tell me even if I went to her.

105
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,840
Why should I give her a hard time?

106
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,160
My mother died miserably.

107
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,720
The skull was broken.

108
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,800
and bled.

109
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,760
What kind of beast

110
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,400
would do such a cruel thing?

111
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,040
Don't worry.

112
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,440
I'll catch the murderer.

113
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,000
When you catch the murderer,

114
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,600
I will make him pay ten times the price

115
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:47,360
to vent my hatred.

116
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,280
Xingyuan.

117
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,200
Auntie Zhao.

118
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,560
Why are you here?

119
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,000
Your mother was quite lonely after she left.

120
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,240
I came to accompany my son.

121
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,400
By the way, I remember something.

122
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,640
On the night your mother was killed,

123
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,760
there was a man

124
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,840
asked me

125
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,040
where your mother lives.

126
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,680
He smells like a bug that just exploded.

127
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,240
He's not a good person.

128
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,920
It could be the culprit.

129
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,440
the smell of bugs.

130
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,560
Yuan Yun.

131
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,560
Auntie Zhao.

132
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,880
Can you do me a favor?

133
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,640
Sure.

134
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,039
This way, please.

135
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,320
Ms. Jo.

136
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,840
Please take a good look.

137
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,559
Okay.

138
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,200
Beichen.

139
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,800
My mother's neighbor, Ms. Zhao.

140
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,120
to visit me.

141
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,120
Have a good chat

142
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,640
I'll ask the kitchen to cook something delicious

143
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,400
I'll leave you to it.

144
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,400
I'll carry this basket in for you.

145
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:58,880
Okay.

146
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,520
It's him.

147
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,560
It's him. It's him. It's him. It's him.

148
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,280
Are you sure?

149
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,240
Don’t you trust Min Ja?

150
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,320
It’s definitely not him.

151
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,160
The stink you mentioned

152
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,080
the smell of Yuan Yun?

153
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,360
They all stink,

154
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,080
but not the same.

155
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,120
Xingyuan.

156
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,800
That must be your man.

157
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,960
I can tell from his eyes.

158
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,040
Such a handsome man.

159
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,840
You should seize it.

160
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,280
Stop being paranoid.

161
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,640
Min Ja.

162
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,120
I told you everything.

163
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,480
Please let me go.

164
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,640
Why did you go up there?

165
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,600
Come down.

166
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,120
There's something I don't understand.
