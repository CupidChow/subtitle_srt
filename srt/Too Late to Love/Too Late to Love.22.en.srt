1
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,880
It's like this. It's like this.

2
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,080
From the beginning,

3
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,880
You're using me.

4
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,360
But I don't care.

5
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,920
You shouldn't have killed my father.

6
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,240
kill my father.

7
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,400
He is the only family

8
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,240
in this world.

9
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,040
You know?

10
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,440
From beginning to end,

11
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,840
I just want to see him

12
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,960
in our wedding.

13
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,040
Kill him!

14
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,040
Kill him! Kill him!

15
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,840
[Why?]

16
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,440
I'm sorry.

17
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,840
[I'm sorry.] [I'm sorry.]

18
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,120
[I've never used you.] [I've never used you.]

19
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,440
[I've never used you.] [I've never used you before.]

20
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,760
I told you. I'm not going anywhere.

21
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,080
[No matter where you go, I'll go with you.] [I'll go with you.]

22
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,440
wherever you go.

23
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,120
I'll go with you. Okay.

24
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,320
[Xiao Man.]

25
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,360
Xiaoman.

26
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,200
Xiaoman.

27
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,240
Xiao Man, don't sleep.

28
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,079
I can save you.

29
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,160
Xiao Man.

30
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,200
Xiao Man.

31
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,720
It's in the study.

32
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,480
In the study.

33
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,720
Thirty-six Tactics.

34
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,000
Next to it.

35
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,120
Xingyuan.

36
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,480
In the next life,

37
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,600
in the next life.

38
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,120
[Don't meet me.]

39
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,880
[Xiao Man.]

40
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,640
Xiao Man.

41
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,320
Xiao Man.

42
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,160
Xiao Man.

43
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
Why are you back?

44
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,760
I'm here to save you.

45
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,600
Come on!

46
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,360
Go!

47
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:22,840
Lin Xingyuan!

48
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,640
Lin Xingyuan.

49
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,960
Mr. Xia.

50
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,840
Come out!

51
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,520
Mr. Xia.

52
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,560
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

53
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,320
Kill me.

54
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,920
You'll regret it.

55
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,640
I want to know how you make me regret.

56
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,600
Fang Yilin did kill Miss Xia.

57
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,120
The record with evidence does exist.

58
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,360
But someone switched it.

59
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,960
Ms. Oh went to get it.

60
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,960
I'll be right there.

61
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,040
How long is it?

62
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,640
Ten minutes at most.

63
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,680
Ten minutes.

64
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,360
We can't escape anyway.

65
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,280
Wait for ten more minutes.

66
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,920
for the president,

67
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,480
to the president.

68
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,120
Are you sure just ten minutes?

69
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,120
One more minute,

70
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,480
you'll shoot us.

71
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,320
Anything new?

72
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,160
You dragged me for more than ten days last time.

73
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,640
Not even a second this time.

74
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,440
Why did you kill Xia Duoduo?

75
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,520
I didn’t want to kill her.

76
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,360
Blame her. Blame her.

77
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,400
Jiang Beichen is to blame.

78
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,480
for not punishing you.

79
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,440
I had to use Mr. Xia to get rid of you.

80
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Fang Yilin, that bastard.

81
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,680
Let’s go.

82
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,200
Okay.

83
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,080
I told you.

84
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,920
I won't let any bullet

85
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,760
get past me.

86
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,600
Hit you!

87
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,720
Hang in there.

88
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,120
I'll get the medicine kit.

89
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,880
Don't go.

90
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,760
Every time you take the medicine box,

91
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,560
bad things will happen.

92
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,320
I want to live a little longer.

93
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,320
Don't cry.

94
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,760
What's wrong?

95
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,760
Does it hurt?

96
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,000
Does it hurt?

97
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:58,960
Yes.

98
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,640
Of course it hurts.

99
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,880
Does it still hurt?

100
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:07,840
Yes.

101
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,000
Are you okay?

102
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,360
What are you doing?

103
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,040
I'll stop the bleeding.

104
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,440
Your mouth is full of bacteria, you know?

105
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,680
Your wound

106
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,640
are infected by you.

107
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,680
Got it.

108
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,640
Does it still hurt?

109
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,080
Of course it hurts.

110
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,040
No.

111
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,400
It doesn't hurt at all.

112
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,440
Liar.

113
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,960
You're afraid of pain.

114
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,600
I know.

115
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,520
I'm sorry.

116
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,880
I failed to protect you.

117
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,320
Jiang Beichen!

118
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,680
Jiang Beichen!

119
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,960
Jiang Beichen! Wake up!

120
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,240
Jiang Beichen.

121
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,440
Touch it.

122
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,160
I carved this myself.

123
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,760
I heard that

124
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,640
as long as the new couple is carved by themselves,

125
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,120
they can grow old together.

126
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,840
Jiang Beichen.

127
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,520
The Fang family is fine.

128
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,800
Don't worry.

129
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,320
I thought I couldn't do it alone.

130
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,960
So,

131
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,000
I wasn't forced to do that.

132
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,840
But...

133
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,560
I'm really tired.

134
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,920
So can you manage Beichen?

135
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,400
Tell him not to slack off.

136
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,800
It's been half a year.

137
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,360
Time to get up and work.

138
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,840
Madam, bad news.

139
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,600
Eldest Young Master is missing.

140
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,240
Look carefully.

141
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,280
I touched it with my hands.

142
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,760
Not in bed.

143
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,040
Xingyuan.
