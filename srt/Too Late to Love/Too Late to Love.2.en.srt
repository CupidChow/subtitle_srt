1
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,080
It was him. It was him. It was him.

2
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,680
I saw it with my own eyes.

3
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,160
It's here. It's here. It's here.

4
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,840
I found a shell.

5
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,440
Do you want to do a test?

6
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,120
The diagram is 6.3.

7
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,520
[Happy Birthday] [Happy Birthday]

8
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,280
Look at this. Look at this.

9
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,440
[I can only save you.] [I can only save you.]

10
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,960
I'll save you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.

11
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,320
I won't kill anyone.

12
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,520
It's a gun. It's a gun. It's a gun.

13
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,039
A gun.

14
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,080
is for saving yourself.

15
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,039
It's for you.

16
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,880
It's here. It's here.

17
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,360
I like it.

18
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,440
Where is Lin Xingyuan?

19
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,880
I'm asking you. Where is Lin Xingyuan?

20
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,360
Where is she?

21
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,520
No.

22
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,360
I don't have it here either. I don't have it here.

23
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,480
Even if we turn Rong City upside down,

24
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,800
find her.

25
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,200
Where did she go?

26
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,680
I'm hungry.

27
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,480
I went out to buy some red bean cakes.

28
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,079
Would you like some?

29
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,520
Which one?

30
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,640
Ma's

31
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,520
There is only one way

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,400
All rocks

33
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,040
Where did you get the mud on your shoes

34
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,840
I stepped on the hill in the afternoon.

35
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,320
What about the mud on your nails?

36
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,920
I fell down.

37
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,520
What happened?

38
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,600
Stop pretending.

39
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,960
You killed Master!

40
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,640
Master Fang is dead?

41
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,079
How is that possible?

42
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,000
Let me have a look.

43
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,920
Where's the gun I gave you?

44
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,640
Two years ago,

45
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,240
It was left on the bridge of dependence. It was left on the bridge of El. It was left behind by Director Jiang.

46
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,400
Director Jiang forgot it.

47
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,440
I don't know where it is.

48
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:09,840
Cracking

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,440
"Throw".

50
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,600
What does it mean?

51
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,520
What a coincidence.

52
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,720
The gun killed my father.

53
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,800
Even if I picked up the gun,

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,680
it can't prove that I'm the murderer.

55
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,000
I saw you kill Old Master.

56
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,079
Was it my left hand or right hand?

57
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,440
Where did you shoot?

58
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,680
How many shots did you shoot?

59
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,360
Mrs. Wang.

60
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,079
Don't be afraid.

61
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,360
Just say what you see.

62
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,200
I saw Dr. Lin covered in blood.

63
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,320
and walked out of Master's study.

64
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,720
You usually look at people with eyes narrowed.

65
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,600
You're either short-sighted or old-fashioned.

66
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,320
Can Director Jiang believe

67
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,079
Can Director Jiang believe it? Yes.

68
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:53,880
Mrs. Wang,

69
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,760
Why do you think she is the murderer?

70
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,960
That person was wearing a white dress.

71
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,480
wearing a white tie leather shoes.

72
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,400
Only Dr. Lin likes to wear them like this.

73
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,400
Oh, right.

74
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,720
She's wearing a pearl hairpin.

75
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,720
This is it.

76
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,360
And Young Master.

77
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,400
I have a good nose.

78
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,600
You know that.

79
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,280
At that time,

80
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,519
I also smelled

81
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,240
the fragrance of rose.

82
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,959
Twins.

83
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,720
What else do you want to say?

84
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,600
Mrs. Wang has no grudge against you. She won't wrong you, right?

85
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,960
She's not the murderer.

86
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,600
Brother Beichen.

87
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,480
Xingyuan can't be the murderer.

88
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,560
She was with me.

89
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,400
Where are you?

90
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,680
My room.

91
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,760
What are you doing?

92
00:04:59,480 --> 00:04:59,880
Have some tea.

93
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,440
What tea?

94
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:02,880
Pu.

95
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,600
Yilin told me

96
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,280
you can't drink this kind of tea.

97
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,000
I got it wrong.

98
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,000
It's Yunhong.

99
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,760
The Red Team's Mansion has long been gone.

100
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,720
That's Nine Songs of Red plum.

101
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,360
Xiao Man, you're here. You're here. Let's go.

102
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,800
Stop it.

103
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,240
Brother Beichen.

104
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,320
Xingyuan can't be the murderer.

105
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,800
Take her away!

106
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:26,920
Brother Beichen.

107
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,240
Let's go.

108
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,920
Brother Beichen.

109
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,680
Xingyuan was wronged.

110
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,200
I've been reading in the study.

111
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,880
I went out to buy snacks when I was hungry.

112
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,480
I wasn't with Xiao Man.

113
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,120
But I believe

114
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,200
Mr. Jiang won’t wrong a good man.

115
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:44,880
Of course,

116
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,000
Look at this. Look at this. Look at this. Look at this.

117
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:54,680
Search.

118
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,680
Search carefully.

119
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,040
Dr. Lin.

120
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,600
Why did you kill my father?

121
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,600
It wasn't me.

122
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,520
But he said

123
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,600
As you know,

124
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,960
Chief Jiang and I

125
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,200
with Director Jiang.

126
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,320
If I want to kill Master Fang,

127
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,800
I have plenty of opportunities.

128
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,480
Why do you have to do it when Chief Jiang is here?

129
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,080
and leave so many flaws?

130
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,720
Do you think

131
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,960
I’m that stupid?

132
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,480
Oh, no.

133
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,920
Dr. Lin is the smartest woman

134
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,480
I've ever met.

135
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,600
Can you let me go

136
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,840
Let me find the truth

137
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
and clear my name.

138
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,280
You don't believe me?

139
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,760
That's how the dialogue novel opens.

140
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,440
What's wrong?

141
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,000
You...

142
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,159
try this?

143
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,840
If you didn't take me in,

144
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,080
and treated me like his own son,

145
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,200
I wouldn't have become who I am today.

146
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:51,800
Get lost!

147
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,520
So dirty.

148
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,440
Come on. Come on.

149
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,040
Take it.

150
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,440
Beichen.

151
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,200
Let me ask you.

152
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,000
what do you want to do when you grow up?

153
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,920
I want to be a police officer to protect my father.

154
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,720
That's great.

155
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,160
Then my life

156
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,200
to you.

157
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,360
Father.

158
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,200
I will avenge you.

159
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:15,840
I think

160
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,000
you think your life is too long.

161
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,840
That woman is a venomous snake.

162
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,080
Whoever gets hurt will die.

163
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,799
If I see you approach her again,

164
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,480
I'll break your legs.

165
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,240
Understand?

166
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,400
Yes.

167
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,040
Don't waste your energy.

168
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,360
There's no key.

169
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,520
You can't open it.

170
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:37,880
Wait.

171
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,400
I plead guilty.

172
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,160
I killed Master Fang.
