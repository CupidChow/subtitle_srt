1
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,880
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

2
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,600
You even killed your own father.

3
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,480
He doesn't deserve to be my father.

4
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,960
[But he didn't expect me to be his father.] [He didn't expect me to be his father.]

5
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,560
It's me.

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,400
I sent him off.

7
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,840
What about Xia Duoduo?

8
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,319
I didn’t want to kill her.

9
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,280
Blame

10
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,920
Jiang Beichen should be blamed.

11
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,160
for not punishing you.

12
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:13,920
I had to use Mr. Xia's help to get rid of you.

13
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,160
So,

14
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,000
You two killed her.

15
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,640
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,280
Sorry.

17
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,200
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey!

18
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,479
I'm not blaming you.

19
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,520
He's so nice to you.

20
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,680
He almost dug out his heart for you.

21
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,920
How could you do that?

22
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,720
But it's okay.

23
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,320
I'll send you down right away.

24
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,200
Go downstairs and coax him.

25
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,040
and apologize to him.

26
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:18,520
Maybe that fool

27
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,079
will accept you.

28
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,800
I've already figured out the headlines for you tomorrow.

29
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,720
The police chief and his wife killed each other.

30
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,960
No.

31
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,760
alive.

32
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,560
Get up.

33
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:55,920
The curtain call.

34
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,600
I know the murderer is Fang Yilin.

35
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,320
But

36
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,720
I need you to act with me.

37
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:52,680
Okay.

38
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,079
You two are acting to fool me.

39
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,600
I've thought about the headlines tomorrow.

40
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,760
What do you think?

41
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,840
The son of the richest man. He killed his father.

42
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,080
revealed his father's death

43
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,280
and framed his brother and sister.

44
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,480
and kill each other.

45
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,519
When did you know?

46
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,000
Uncle Yu told me.

47
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,040
Impossible. He has...

48
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,240
He was killed by you.

49
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,240
You didn't know, did you? You didn't, did you?

50
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,360
You don't know, do you? It's a dead body.

51
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,760
The body can also talk.

52
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,080
Uncle Yu told me

53
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,920
on the night my mother was killed,

54
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,840
he heard the murderer's voice.

55
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,600
I guess

56
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,880
he knew it was you.

57
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,800
so you killed him.

58
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,640
It can't prove that I killed my father.

59
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,720
That gun

60
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,520
is a birthday gift from Beichen.

61
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,880
Two years ago,

62
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,880
[two years ago.]

63
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,160
Yu Xiaoman picked it up

64
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,040
and got to you.

65
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,560
You killed my father

66
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,600
for the inheritance.

67
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,360
I underestimated you.

68
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,000
You two are not as stupid as I thought.

69
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,320
You're hopeless.

70
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:39,120
I'm just taking back what belongs to me.

71
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,320
Is that wrong?

72
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,840
If you don't kill the woman I love the most,

73
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,440
those things were yours.

74
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,520
He's dead anyway.

75
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,159
Everything you say is right.

76
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,920
Your mother

77
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,720
pushed you into the pond.

78
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,640
I risked my life to save you.

79
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,760
But he can't swim either.

80
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,600
You two almost didn't come back.

81
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,560
What you're doing now

82
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,640
Jiang Beichen.

83
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,400
Don't just stand there and talk.

84
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,560
Since young,

85
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,520
I only care about you.

86
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,600
Every time I cook, I cook the dishes you like.

87
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,400
He loves you more than me.

88
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,920
What about me?

89
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,200
I'm his biological son.

90
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,080
I studied abroad when I was young.

91
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:36,960
I joined the army.

92
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,600
Fight! Fight!

93
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,480
Finally, I came back to Rong City to be a policeman.

94
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,320
because I didn't want to compete with you for anything related to the Fang family.

95
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,000
I didn't want to deal with you.

96
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,400
But you investigated me.

97
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,000
You want me to die too?

98
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,400
It's not like that, Yilin.

99
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,480
If you made a mistake,

100
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,400
you should be punished.

101
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,800
That's my father's dog.

102
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,960
You are as heartless as him.

103
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,120
Beichen.

104
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,080
Hang in there.

105
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,520
I'll take you to bandage your wound.

106
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,400
Let's go.

107
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,040
What's wrong?

108
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:20,960
Just kidding.

109
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,760
I'm fine.

110
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,640
It's all my fault.

111
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,200
But

112
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,440
you have to tell me

113
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,520
what I did wrong.

114
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,720
Ever since I met you,

115
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,840
since I met you.

116
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,040
If you get hurt again,

117
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,160
hide somewhere I can't see.

118
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,080
I don't care.

119
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,040
You're my wife.

120
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,000
Who cares about me if you don’t?

121
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,880
Zhang Duoduo.

122
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,000
Li Duoduo.

123
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,080
Wang Duoduo.

124
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,720
But none

125
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,440
is not you.

126
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,200
Now I know.

127
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,000
I always know.

128
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,640
You said

129
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,960
If we knew each other since childhood,

130
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,040
we grew up together,

131
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,360
We'll confirm each other's feelings at some point.

132
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,360
sooner or later,

133
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,160
so many things wouldn't have happened.

134
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,200
Then it's a deal.

135
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,480
No matter what happens,

136
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,000
no matter what happens.

137
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,000
Even if it's for my own good,

138
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,840
I have to make my own decision.

139
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,200
At least in the future,

140
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,640
in the future,

141
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,760
on each other.

142
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,120
Okay?

143
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,240
Okay.

144
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,560
Don't go out these days.

145
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,280
I'll ask Secretary Oh

146
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,120
24 hours a day.

147
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,880
Don't worry.

148
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,440
I'll find Yilin as soon as possible.

149
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,800
Alright.

150
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,320
Don't think too much.

151
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,760
Have a good rest.

152
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,600
What's wrong?

153
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,920
Yu Xiaoman ran away.

154
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,360
What?

155
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,360
He ran away.

156
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,640
Keep an eye on Beichen.
