1
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,800
I'm not defending Xiao Man. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not.

2
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,800
On the Dragon Boat Festival,

3
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,040
I went to deliver rice dumplings to Rumeng.

4
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,400
I heard a man talking through the door.

5
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,480
That man

6
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,040
was the one who killed Like A Dream.

7
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,400
What time did you go there?

8
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,720
At 9:15 p.m., I heard you were there. I heard you.

9
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,040
I heard someone inside.

10
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:53,880
I went back.

11
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,080
It matches the time of the crime.

12
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,720
Why didn't you tell me

13
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,240
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,760
You know my relationship with Ru Meng.

15
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,959
I'm afraid I can't explain it and get myself into trouble.

16
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,160
I was hesitating for a while.

17
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,440
I was going to tell you

18
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,320
I didn't expect you to leave Mengzhou.

19
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,560
That man's voice

20
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,960
his voice?

21
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,400
It's been too long I can't remember

22
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,800
Anyway, he's a young man.

23
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,520
Xiao Man must be taking the blame for him.

24
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,480
Don't worry.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,920
I will

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,440
to persuade Xiaoman to find out the truth.

27
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,280
Did they give you a hard time?

28
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,880
You were unhappy when you were young.

29
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,759
Once you eat this candy, you...

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,920
What are you doing here?

31
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,320
Man Man, why bother?

32
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,720
You're a murderer for a man.

33
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,840
What are you talking about?

34
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,720
I know you're not the murderer.

35
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,320
As long as you tell me who the murderer is,

36
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,960
I'll ask Xingyuan

37
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,520
to talk to Director Jiang.

38
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,760
Let you go.

39
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,960
Don't beg her. I'm the murderer. I'm the murderer. I'm the murderer.

40
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,240
I'm the murderer!

41
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,800
Let me out!

42
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,280
I'll kill her first.

43
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,200
You...

44
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,880
Your mother's death...

45
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,040
is my fault.

46
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,800
It has nothing to do with others.

47
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,520
You can't get into trouble.

48
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,480
Get out!

49
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,240
Get out!

50
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,920
Get out! Get out!

51
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,360
Get out of here!

52
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,480
Don't worry.

53
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,960
Give me more time.

54
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,400
I can convince her.

55
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,520
By the way,

56
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,640
I'm here

57
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,480
to tell you.

58
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,800
I hope everyone is here because

59
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,880
a week before Master Fang passed away,

60
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,880
he made a will

61
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,080
and asked me to verify it.

62
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,200
This is it.

63
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,280
The will is as follows.

64
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,480
I'm willing to sell 40 stores under my name

65
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,640
20 properties

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,280
and all cash investments

67
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,680
to

68
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,160
to Lin Xingyuan.

69
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,079
How could it be Dr. Lin?

70
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,720
Don't you dote on him the most?

71
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,280
Why didn't you give it to him?

72
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,120
Young Master is his son.

73
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,240
He didn't give it to me.

74
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,200
Did Master and Dr. Lin

75
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,000
have an affair?

76
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,800
That's not right.

77
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,720
Didn't you say Dr. Lin

78
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,320
why my father

79
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,640
left all his inheritance to Lin Xingyuan?

80
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,880
Because she’s Mr. Fang’s daughter.

81
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,160
From now on,

82
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,080
you are the master of the Fang family.

83
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,680
the richest man in Rong City.

84
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,000
I don't care.

85
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,960
He abandoned me and my mother.

86
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,000
and made us suffer so much.

87
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,440
Do you think this can make up for it?

88
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,040
You misunderstood your father.

89
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,280
He never abandoned you and your daughter.

90
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,960
Everything

91
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,240
is fate.

92
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,159
Your father and your mother loved each other.

93
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,480
and engaged in private.

94
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,240
This is my first time drawing eyebrows.

95
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,400
I'm not good at it.

96
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,160
I'll practice hard from now on.

97
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,680
Your eyebrows

98
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,720
looks good.

99
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,120
Who knows?

100
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,280
the good scenery didn't last long.

101
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,920
The elders of the Fang family thought your mother was from a lowly background.

102
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,960
and arranged a marriage for your father.

103
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,200
It was Madam Fang.

104
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,440
Madam Fang is so obsessed with your father.

105
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,480
She even poisoned your father

106
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,240
with Fang Yilin.

107
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,760
Your father is a stubborn man.

108
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,760
He would rather die than marry your mother.

109
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,040
Who wants to marry you on the wedding night?

110
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,000
Madam Fang.

111
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,360
She switched the beam

112
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,880
to marry your mother.

113
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,320
Your mother was disheartened

114
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,480
and left Mengzhou.

115
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,640
I found you.

116
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,240
All these years,

117
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,600
your mother has been unwilling to tell your father.

118
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,880
She was in Mengzhou.

119
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,000
A month ago,

120
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,480
your father came here

121
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,840
Your father told your mother

122
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,800
Madam Fang died of illness many years ago.

123
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,440
Now there's no obstacle

124
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,080
between them.

125
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,680
Your father

126
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,880
wanted to make up for his regret.

127
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,160
and marry your mother.

128
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,080
I didn't agree.

129
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,760
But your mother didn't listen to me.

130
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,320
In the end,

131
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,960
No wonder he cried so sadly at my mother's funeral.

132
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:39,880
Then...

133
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,840
why didn't you tell me back then?

134
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,280
Your father was worried about you.

135
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,000
Dangerous?

136
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,960
I heard him mention it.

137
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,360
I don't know the details.

138
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,200
Dr. Lin, don't worry.

139
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,600
As long as I'm here, no one will bully you.

140
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,760
Master Fang.

141
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,440
I don't need your protection.

142
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,600
The last thing I said to him

143
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,400
was

144
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,040
I don't need him.

145
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,640
Your father won't care.

146
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,480
He just wants you to be fine.

147
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,400
He left all his inheritance to me.

148
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,400
And the murderer kept framing me.

149
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,800
and tried to kill me.

150
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,280
Obviously,

151
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,600
his goal is this inheritance.

152
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,920
And the beneficiary of the inheritance was...

153
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,680
So,

154
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,600
the murderer is Mr. Fang,

155
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,200
or Director Jiang.

156
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,480
What should we do next?

157
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,720
what are you going to do?

158
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,920
Roasted duck.

159
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,120
Here you go. Here you go.

160
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,000
Roast chicken.

161
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,400
These are all your favorite dishes.

162
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,760
Don't waste your energy.

163
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,640
In my heart,

164
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,280
you can only get three words.

165
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,520
Go to hell!

166
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,039
Do you think I won't know

167
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,799
if you don't tell me?

168
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,080
The murderer is in Fang Mansion.

169
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,040
and the beneficiary of his inheritance.

170
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,240
I found evidence of his murder.

171
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,960
For Uncle’s sake,

172
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,360
as long as you can testify against him,

173
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,080
I'll let you go.

174
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,320
You have no evidence.

175
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,120
Otherwise, you wouldn't have come to me.

176
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,840
Believe it or not, it's up to you.

177
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,520
I'll give you half a day.

178
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,480
Think about it.
