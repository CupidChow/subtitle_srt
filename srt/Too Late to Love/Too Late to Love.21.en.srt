1
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,600
It's not enough. It's not enough. It's not enough. It's not enough.

2
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,120
You hurt Yilin! You hurt her! You hurt her!

3
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,600
If it weren't for you,

4
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,400
he would have been the master of the Fang family.

5
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,000
You ruined him!

6
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,520
Go to hell!

7
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,040
You love him so much.

8
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,920
I'm willing to die for him.

9
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,280
What about him?

10
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,880
So what if Yi Lin killed him?

11
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:53,960
He deserves it.

12
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,240
He should have gone to accompany my mother long ago.

13
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,880
Uncle Yu didn't plan to leave Rong City alive.

14
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,120
Do you know why I didn't send you to the police station?

15
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,440
You're afraid I'll talk nonsense?

16
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,600
Do you think Beichen

17
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,120
can your testimony reach Mr. Xia's ears?

18
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,120
Uncle Yu begged us

19
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,079
to take the blame for you.

20
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,440
and die for you.

21
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,760
We couldn't bear to see him like this.

22
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,000
because he's old.

23
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,760
Are you really going to sacrifice someone

24
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,520
for someone who wants you to die?

25
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,920
Mom.

26
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,840
Xiaoman.

27
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,680
What's wrong?

28
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,080
Who bullied Xiao Man?

29
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,840
Dad, look.

30
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,680
Look at this.

31
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,160
Let me show you a magic trick.

32
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,480
Change.

33
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,079
What's this?

34
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,519
What is this?

35
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,760
Xiaoman likes candy the most.

36
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,800
Can you open it?

37
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,720
Open the candy

38
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,360
Open it.

39
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,680
Open it and see what's inside.

40
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,560
Don't think

41
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,880
I'll forgive you.

42
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,320
I promised Mr. Yu

43
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,040
I'll let you go.

44
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,840
Go.

45
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,080
I have chest tightness and shortness of breath lately.

46
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,600
Is the poison going to take effect?

47
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,520
Mr. Xia is still in the mood to eat here?

48
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,960
The ten-day deadline is coming. Go catch the murderer.

49
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,520
Didn't you refuse to betray them?

50
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,800
Yes.

51
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,000
I risked my life to protect them.

52
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:54,640
But they...

53
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,560
We got married yesterday, you know?

54
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,520
I wanted to make a scene at the wedding night,

55
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,280
but I heard Lin Xingyuan's plan.

56
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,920
After marrying Jiang Beichen,

57
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,560
they will be a family.

58
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,880
Are you going to push me out as a scapegoat?

59
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,840
Jiang Beichen did it.

60
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,280
Why should I trust you?

61
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,200
Your poison...

62
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,640
I have the antidote.

63
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,160
Lin Xingyuan injected you

64
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,440
is not poison, but insulin.

65
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,320
Your reaction is just hypoglycemia.

66
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,120
They did this

67
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,920
to stall you.

68
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,640
to find a scapegoat.

69
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,400
You bastard!

70
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,960
I thought they were throwing smoke bombs at their wedding.

71
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,120
I didn't expect that

72
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,120
Let's play another trick.

73
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,080
Go.

74
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,400
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

75
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,000
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

76
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:01,920
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

77
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,560
I looked everywhere I could.

78
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,200
No.

79
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,440
Bring Mr. Xia here.

80
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:12,760
Okay.

81
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,640
No need.

82
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,560
Mr. Xia.

83
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,920
What do you mean?

84
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,360
I'm here to catch the murderer.

85
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,480
You two...

86
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,240
What else do you have to say?

87
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,520
Xingyuan is not the murderer.

88
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,600
Fang Yilin is the murderer.

89
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,360
We have evidence.

90
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,360
Fang Yilin admitted that he killed Miss Xia.

91
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,720
Did you take the wrong one?

92
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,240
There are two records in the room.

93
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,120
I looked carefully.

94
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,159
This is the only one.

95
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,480
How dare you fool me!

96
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,160
Kill all of them!

97
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:19,720
Yes.

98
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,040
Ms. Oh.

99
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,320
Take Xingyuan to the back door.

100
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,840
Be careful.

101
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,560
I'll wait for you.

102
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,280
Don't worry.

103
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,720
Don't let that bitch run away.

104
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,600
Let her go!

105
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,800
Drop the gun.

106
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,080
Or I'll cut her neck off.

107
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,800
Handcuff her.

108
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,360
You're going to die anyway.

109
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,360
Why don't you go first

110
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,760
and wait for him in the afterlife.

111
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,160
Wait.

112
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,120
Xiao Man.

113
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,560
Xiaoman.

114
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,320
I'm glad you're fine.

115
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,840
Once I kill this bitch,

116
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,680
I can take back everything that belongs to us.

117
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,360
Wait.

118
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,840
I want to end it myself.

119
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,840
Okay.
