1
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,120
Move! Move! Move!

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,360
Don't move.

3
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,160
Let me send you back.

4
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'll do it myself.

5
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,479
Don't move.

6
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,120
You should be hurt.

7
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,759
Do you like me?

8
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,160
Yes. I like you.

9
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,040
I don't like you.

10
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,800
Is it because of my brother?

11
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,040
I heard from Xiaoman that you two used to be together.

12
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,639
He treated you like this.

13
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,920
Now that I think about it,

14
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,560
he was actually helping me.

15
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,440
Otherwise, Xia Duoduo won’t let me go.

16
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,560
She is my brother’s fiancée.

17
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,880
My brother won't marry you.

18
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:26,920
That's great.

19
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,160
I won't marry him.

20
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,760
Never.

21
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,520
Okay. Okay.

22
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,200
I won't give up. I won't.

23
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,920
I won't give up. Let's go.

24
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,840
Let's go. Let's go.

25
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,280
Let go of me!

26
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,200
Let go of me!

27
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,520
Hurry up!

28
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,120
Okay.

29
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,320
I'll listen to you.

30
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,400
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

31
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,720
Father.

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,040
My daughter Duoduo and Director Jiang are getting married next month.

33
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,760
Welcome.

34
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,280
Okay.

35
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,400
Give it to me.

36
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,720
Lin Rumeng, the famous dancer of Fairy Lok Fang.

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Do you know her?

38
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,040
Miss Lin

39
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,200
is her daughter.

40
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,640
Like mother, like daughter.

41
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Miss Lin must be good at dancing too.

42
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,440
Today is my birthday.

43
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,840
It's also my engagement date with Brother Beichen.

44
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,240
Miss Lin didn't bring any gifts.

45
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,320
How about

46
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,720
dance for us?

47
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:06,840
OK.

48
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,040
Okay. Okay.

49
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,000
Let's go. Okay.

50
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,560
I invited you here

51
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,080
not just for eating and drinking.

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,320
If you don't dance today,

53
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,560
I won't let you go.

54
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,440
I can't dance alone.

55
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,600
Dance partner?

56
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,280
I’ve prepared it for you.

57
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,920
Duoduo.

58
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,080
You’re so thoughtful.

59
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,320
The show is coming.

60
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,160
Let's go.

61
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,200
Let them dance.

62
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,000
Let's have fun.

63
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,920
Push me away. Push me away.

64
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,760
Come on. Come on.

65
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,560
Choose one.

66
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,680
Dance with another woman at the engagement ceremony.

67
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,360
Director Jiang, are you being polite to Miss Xia

68
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,080
or not?

69
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,360
Are you saying this

70
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,120
to help Xia Duoduo

71
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,360
or for yourself?

72
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,400
Okay.

73
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,400
Good job.

74
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,760
Good. Good job.

75
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,200
He is your future son-in-law.

76
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,960
He studied abroad in Beichen. He's open-minded.

77
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,600
Great. Great.

78
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,840
I feel better now.

79
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,360
Dr. Lin is a good physician.

80
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,040
In Shihua Tuo,

81
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,400
Have some tea.

82
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,320
Is the medicine okay?

83
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,600
Don't worry, Miss.

84
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,880
After combining Prince's water and tea,

85
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,920
It's colorless and tasteless.

86
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,160
He won't be able to taste it.

87
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,440
I mean the effect.

88
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,040
When Lin and Mr. Fang are together,

89
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,760
I'll see how she can seduce Brother Beichen.

90
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,880
Yilin,

91
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,320
Where's the book I gave you?

92
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,480
I can't find it.

93
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,960
In the study.

94
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,800
I found it.

95
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,880
I couldn't find it.

96
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,040
How about

97
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,280
find it for me?

98
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,160
Dr. Lin.

99
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,360
Wait for me.

100
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,520
There's more in the teapot.

101
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,760
Director Jiang,

102
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,960
wait in your room?

103
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,240
Actually, I'm not feeling well lately.

104
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,800
Dr. Lin, can you help me?

105
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,840
Really?

106
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,880
What's that? What's that?

107
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,360
I feel dizzy.

108
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,720
Disgusting.

109
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,560
Sometimes

110
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,120
Earringing.

111
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,320
My eyesight is dropping.

112
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,120
It sounds like

113
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,760
It's paranoid again.

114
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,160
Not only that.

115
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,480
I have chest tightness and shortness of breath.

116
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,640
Insomnia and many dreams.

117
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,600
His condition is getting worse.

118
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,680
How about

119
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,360
take a tranquilizer?
