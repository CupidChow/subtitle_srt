7
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,040
Hey, you're awake.

8
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,480
Why didn't you get more sleep?

9
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,599
You animal!

10
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:24,319
Tell me.

11
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:25,319
What did you do to me?

12
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:26,319
I didn't do anything.

13
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,680
Why am I naked then?

14
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,599
You got drunk last night
and threw up all over yourself.

15
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,190
And you took advantage of me,
didn't you?

16
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,159
I didn't.

17
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:32,920
Are you...

18
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,319
You liar!

19
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,560
I did go to your room last night
to help you change.

20
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:48,840
You were drunk.

21
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:54,519
Alright.

22
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:55,840
I was wrong about you.

23
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,840
Is that all?

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,879
What more do you want?

25
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,240
You hurt me

26
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,560
both mentally and physically.

27
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,400
Shouldn't you compensate me?

28
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,120
If you want me to pay you back,

29
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:14,639
sure.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,290
But I don't have money right now.

31
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:16,919
Queue up.

32
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,199
Do you think

33
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,840
that all men are particularly sleazy?

34
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,080
That's right.

35
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,000
All of you men are particularly sleazy.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,919
You love manipulation and betrayal!

37
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,319
I don't.

38
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:32,840
My plan is ruined anyway.

39
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,890
Come upstairs with me.
I'll write you an IOU.

40
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,319
Leave once you get it.

41
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,840
What's the use of an IOU?

42
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,159
I have to follow you around

43
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,680
so you don't run away.

44
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,520
Follow me around then.

45
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:46,920
If someone tries to attack me,

46
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,620
you'd be able
to take a couple of strikes for me.

47
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:49,360
Slow down.

48
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,159
Wait for me.

49
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,319
Did someone really attack you?

50
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,719
Wait for me.

51
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,159
Miss.

52
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:11,840
Hey.

53
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,159
I'd like to gossip.

54
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,479
What is the relationship
between the couple

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,039
that just went upstairs?

56
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,759
Can you figure it out?

57
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,000
I don't think they're a couple.

58
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:23,240
Why?

59
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:25,719
The girl got drunk last night.

60
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,879
I helped her clean up.

61
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,840
The guys just slept at the side.

62
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:31,560
Thank you.

63
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,319
You're welcome.

64
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:45,639
Miss.

65
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,340
What time do you get off work?

66
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,879
Did you live here

67
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,399
when you were a kid?

68
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,680
Yeah.

69
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,560
I lived here with my grandfather.

70
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,480
Is this your grandfather?

71
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,480
Yeah.

72
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,600
When I was little,

73
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,519
my grandfather loved me the most.

74
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,480
When he passed away,

75
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:46,079
he held my hand and told me

76
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,839
that he would miss me the most.

77
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:05,680
Grandpa.

78
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,040
I'm back.

79
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,920
When I was little,

80
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,000
my grandfather and I

81
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:27,000
loved to stargaze

82
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:28,439
from this window.

83
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,839
At that time,

84
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,759
there was a table here.

85
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:36,680
It's where Grandpa

86
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:38,839
likes to tell me stories

87
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,199
and stargaze.

88
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,480
What stories?

89
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,879
Ghost stories.

90
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,160
You two

91
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,399
have unusual hobbies.

92
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:54,000
It's because Grandpa told me

93
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:57,079
a girl should be bold.

94
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,759
This way,

95
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:01,279
I won't get bullied outside.

96
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,240
Let's clean this place up

97
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:19,720
and

98
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,720
restore its brilliance.

99
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,480
What happened?

100
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,639
What happened to you?

101
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,120
Why are you wet?

102
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,759
The pipe burst.

103
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,759
I'll wipe it off for you.

104
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:48,960
Get out.

105
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,679
Get out!

106
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:50,679
Don't look.

107
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,480
What's this?

108
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:49,519
Give me your hands.

109
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,240
Look.

110
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,559
Your nails are broken.

111
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,120
Let me fix them for you.

112
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:06,000
Can you do manicures?

113
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,420
It doesn't hurt to have more skills.

114
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:18,399
This

115
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:19,960
is lemon water.

116
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,759
Yeah.

117
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,080
Lemon water is the best for nail care.

118
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,639
You don't know that, do you?

119
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,440
I've never tried it.

120
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:32,000
Girls need to take good care of themselves

121
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,440
so that

122
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,960
others will take care of them.

123
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,039
You did a pretty good job.

124
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:43,919
To thank you,

125
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,639
I'll take you to a secret place

126
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:47,360

127
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:52,159
