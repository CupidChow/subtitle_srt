=Episode 19=

7
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:42,960
I never loved you.

8
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,600
I'm just grateful to you.

9
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,600
I never loved you.

10
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,959
Ling Feng!

11
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:18,159
I'll

12
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,120
pay you back.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,319
You don't owe me anything.

14
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,079
We're even.

15
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:42,760
Caramel.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,400
Caramel!

17
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,319
Caramel!

18
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,159
Caramel!

19
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,800
Caramel.

20
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,319
Ningmeng.

21
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,240
Ningmeng.

22
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,079
Ningmeng.

23
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,879
Why is it you?

24
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,319
Ningmeng.

25
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:31,199
It's me.

26
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,360
I'm Li Ji.

27
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,319
Forgive me.

28
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,600
It's me.

29
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,199
I'm Li Ji.

30
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,720
Don't touch me!

31
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,399
Why?

32
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,399
Huh?

33
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,959
Why won't you forgive me?

34
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,920
I love you the most.

35
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,639
I didn't know what love was

36
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,560
until I met Caramel.

37
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,720
You've never loved anyone but yourself.

38
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,360
You never loved anyone!

39
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,519
Who said that?

40
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,319
After I came to Tongnan,

41
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,160
all...

42
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,839
All I can think about is you.

43
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,079
I can't let go.

44
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,759
I can't let you go.

45
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,560
Tian Ningmeng.

46
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,519
Do you know

47
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,990
that I don't even care
that Liu Lian is pregnant with my baby?

48
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,319
She's worthless to me!

49
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:26,680
You're the only one I love.
You're the only one!

50
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,000
Why are you here?

51
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:56,120
Are you here to ask me for money?

52
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:58,720
I'm here to see Ling Feng.

53
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,639
Haven't you had enough?

54
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,319
You already stole Li Ji.

55
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,519
You even arranged
for Ling Feng to trick me.

56
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:20,480
Do you think you'll be satisfied
only if I die?

57
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,120
I'm sorry

58
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,600
about Li Ji,

59
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,519
but

60
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,839
I didn't arrange Ling Feng

61
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,600
to deceive you.

62
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,879
I came here

63
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:40,600
just to give you the money Ling Feng got

64
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:42,959
from selling his house.

65
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,800
Selling his house?

66
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:49,680
What house?

67
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,959
Do you remember these photos?

68
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,199
Who took them?

69
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,319
Ling Feng.

70
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,279
You've known him for a long time.

71
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,940
Have you found a date
for the New Year's ball?

72
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,440
I asked a new girl.

73
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,159
What about you?

74
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,320
Going with your girlfriend?

75
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,519
Yeah.

76
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:50,960
I wonder who's going

77
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,950
with our campus belle,
Tian Ningmeng, this year.

78
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,120
Hey.

79
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,559
Ling Feng.

80
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:01,960
What are you taking photos of?

81
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:02,480
Huh?

82
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,320
Let me see.

83
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:05,600
By the looks of it,

84
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:07,600
it's no surprise
you haven't found a date.

85
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,420
Who do you think a guy like him

86
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,240
could date?

87
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,559
Don't say that in front of him.

88
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,639
He has shame.

89
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:16,720
Hey.

90
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:18,360
Hey, fatty.

91
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,159
What a strong personality.

92
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:20,990
He has quite a temper.

93
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:21,679
It's fine.

94
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,520
We'll discipline him]
when we get back to the dorm.

95
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,559
Hey, Ling Feng.

96
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,300
You secretly photographed
my best friend.

97
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,559
I... I didn't.

98
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:43,720
I saw you.

99
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,039
How dare you deny?

100
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,559
You secretly photographed her.

101
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,639
Ningmeng.

102
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:50,679
Ningmeng!

103
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,790
This guy was secretly
taking photos of you.

104
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,310
Were you secretly photographing me?

105
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,159
I didn't.

106
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,799
I didn't photograph you secretly.

107
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:02,919
I was just taking photos.

108
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,960
Let me see.

109
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,879
Not bad.

110
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,120
You're quite talented.

111
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:23,559
Fatty.

112
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,550
How dare you secretly
photograph our campus belle?

113
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:26,919
You're quite bold.

114
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:28,720
What are you two doing?

115
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,420
Who was secretly photographing me?

116
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,679
I told him to take photos of me.

117
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,480
Do you two

118
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:34,720
know each other?

119
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,639
That's right. We know each other.

120
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,559
And I'm his date

121
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:40,519
to this year's ball.

122
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:44,279
Campus belle, you're not picky at all.

123
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,720
I think he's a lot more handsome
than you two.

124
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,120
Whoever are you two's dates

125
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,240
are tasteless.

126
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,799
Be chill.

127
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,200
Let's go.

128
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,279
Ningmeng.

129
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:06,200
Do you really
want to be Ling Feng's date?

130
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:08,600
I don't think there's anything wrong with it.

131
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,919
Besides, he takes good photos.

132
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,279
He can take more photos
of the two of us,

133
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,080
right?

134
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,159
No problem.

135
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,440
I'm off to play ball then.

136
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,159
Oh.

137
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,180
See you tomorrow
at the auditorium entrance.

138
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:21,360
And

139
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:22,840
remember to wear a suit.

140
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,320
I like men in suits.

141
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,279
Good luck.

142
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,799
Li Ji!

143
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,080
Li Ji!

144
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,240
Keep it up, Li Ji!

145
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,080
Keep it up!

146
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,000
Li Ji, keep it up!

147
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,039
Keep it up!

148
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,000
Keep it up!

149
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,600
Li Ji!

150
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,159
Have some water.

151
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:11,200
Here.

152
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,639
Thank you.

153
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,600
Thank you.

154
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,759
What are you doing?

155
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:30,799
Let go. Let me go.

156
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:31,960
Let go.

157
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,960
Let me go.

158
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,519
Have some drink.

159
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,519
- Here.
- Ningmeng!

160
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,360
Let me kiss you.

161
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:35,919

163
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,840
How dare you hit me?

164
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,600
Don't touch me.

165
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:41,679
Go to hell.

166
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:43,120
Ningmeng!

167
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:43,879
How dare you hit me?

Ningmeng.

174
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,639
How dare you hit me?

175
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:59,080
Go to hell.

176
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:02,759
How dare you hit me?

177
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,000
Who are you?
