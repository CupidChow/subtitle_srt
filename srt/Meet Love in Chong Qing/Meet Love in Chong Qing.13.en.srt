00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,039
What do you want to do?

9
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,439
Tell me. what will it take
for you to stop harassing Tian Ningmeng.

10
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,880
I invested money

11
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,679
in this company.

12
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:04,799
I just want to withdraw my shares.

13
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,580
I have no part in the company's debts,

14
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,319
so don't blame it on me.

15
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:09,840
How much are the shares?

16
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,959
I'll settle it.

17
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,439
I invested 200 thousand yuan.

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,840
but your homestay business is booming.

19
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,319
So I must gain some profit.

20
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,920
How about this?

21
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,879
Final price.

22
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:26,120
You can have them for 300 thousand yuan.

23
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:29,400
Okay.

24
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,280
Deal.

25
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,959
Keep your word.

26
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,359
Bring the contract over.

27
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:36,719
I'll transfer the money to you now.

28
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,280
Sure.

29
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:43,159
I'll leave after receiving the money.

(Investment Contract)

31
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,599
State in the contract

32
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,880
that you voluntarily transferred
the shares to Ling Feng

33
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,719
and sign it.

34
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,359
So your name is Ling Feng.

35
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,159
Cut the crap.

36
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,239
Fine, I'll sign.

37
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,120
But Ling Feng.

38
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,120
Ningmeng would never
fall in love with you.

41
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,520
Be careful.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Be gentle.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,919
Does it feel better?

44
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,800
You're too hard.

45
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,360
No, ah.

46
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,620
I can't take it anymore.

47

Ah!

00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,520
Does this feel good?

50
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,840
Ah, too hard!

51
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,199
How come your oil massage
hurts more than being beaten?

52
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,520
That'll teach you
to play the hero next time.

53
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,719
If I'm a hero to you,

54
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:03,000
I'll accept the beating.

55
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,199
What did you

56
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,759
discuss with Li Ji this afternoon?

57
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,159
I told him

58
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:30,400
not to harass you again.

59
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,479
Otherwise,

60
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,280
I won't go easy on him.

61
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,400
Thank you, Caramel.

62
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,520
You

63
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,919
won't lie to me,

64
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:48,479
right?

65
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,719
You know I hate it
when people lie to me.

66
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:57,599
Yeah.

67
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,039
I...

68
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,479

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,560
won't lie to me.

72
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:18,800
Do you prefer

73
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,120
top or bottom?

74
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,839
Huh?

75
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,720
You must prefer being passive.

76
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,639
No.

77
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,720
You must be.

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,240
You're a pervert.

79
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,319
It's ticklish.

80
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,600
Let me calm down.

81
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:51,800
I'll go shower first.

82
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:57,959
I'll wait for you to come back!

83
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,439
Calm down.

84
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,519
Calm down.

85
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:09,920

86
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,040

89
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,120
Don't misunderstand.

93
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,120
Why are you here?

94
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,319
I came to see you two,

95
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,439
but I heard you guys doing that thing.

96
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:26,000
So I hid in here.

97
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,160
What were we doing?

98
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,399
There's nothing going on
between me and Ningmeng.

99
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,759
Don't be nervous, young man.

100
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,160
Let me give you a piece of advice.

101
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,720
Go on.

102
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,639
Don't be naked

103
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,560

104
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:43,480

105
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:44,759
Are you okay?

106
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:49,800
Give me some of it.

107
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,500
Open the door!

108
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,000
I... I'm fine.

109
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,600
I'm coming in!

110
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,279
Don't come in!

111
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,560
Uncle?

112
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:21,800
Uncle, you...

113
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,399
Don't make fun of me.

114
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:27,160
Uncle.

115
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,360
I want to ask you about the seeds.

116
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,560
What... What seeds?

117
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,040
Vegetable seeds.

118
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,160
Isn't Tongnan a home of vegetables?

119
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,920
I want to livestream planting vegetables

120
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,199
at our homestay

121
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,040
and use fresh vegetables
to attract tourists.

122
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:47,480
Hey, that's a good idea.

123
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,480
It combines
the scenery around the ancient town

124
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,279
and allows tourists
to experience life by the countryside.

125
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,920
I'm a vegetable farmer.

126
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:58,360
The farm tools and seeds
are readily available.

127
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:00,290
After plowing the soil in the homestay,

128
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,360
we can start planting.

129
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,720
Transplanted seedlings will grow faster.

130
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,600
That's great, Uncle.

131
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,959
You've been a great help this time.

132
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,480
I'll get the stuff with you.

133
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,480
You could teach me

135
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,079
