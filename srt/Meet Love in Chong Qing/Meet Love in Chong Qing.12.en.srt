=Episode 12=

7
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:13,159
Stop.

8
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,400
There's nothing more to say.

9
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,239
I'm leaving.

10
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:23,400
I'll see you out.

11
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:34,359
Fine!

12
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,840
It's not easy for you to come here.

13
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,560
Bring some of our local specialties

14
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,639
back.

15
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,800
We're not stealing, are we?

16
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,840
It's not stealing
if we don't get caught.

17
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:35,680
You're fussy.

18
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,199
Come here.

19
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:42,560
Hold me.

20
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,280
Hold me.

21
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,680
Get up.

22
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:53,800
Be careful.

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,039
A bit higher.

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,080
Be careful.

25
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,560
Get a little closer.

26
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,479
Get a little closer.

27
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:03,000
Be careful.

28
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,680
Can you reach it yet?

29
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,120
I'm running out of strength.

30
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,639
I can't hold on any longer.

31
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,360
You're so stupid.

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,479
I've been picking lemons this way
since I was a kid.

33
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,800
I never fell down.

34
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,960
It's obvious
that you were moving too much.

35
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:38,599
What are you doing in there?

36
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,879
Run.

37
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,840
Sir.

38
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:42,840
Hurry.

39
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,560
Sir, ah.

40
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,199
Sorry, Sir.

41
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,319
Sir.

42
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,280
Sorry.

43
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,180
I'll stop stealing.

44
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:48,690
I'm leaving.

45
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:49,439
Wait!

46
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:50,360
Sorry.

47
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:51,439
Wait for me.

48
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,639
Wait for me. I haven't gotten in yet.

49
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:53,630
How dare you steal my...

50
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,280
Hurry.

51
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,719
If you want lemons,

52
00:03:58,719 --> 00:03:59,599
just say so.

53
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,639
Why steal them?

54
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,600
Does your butt still hurt?

55
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,600
I think you're gloating.

56
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,079
It's a good thing
I didn't get beaten in vain.

57
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,439
Then...

58
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,720
I'll leave you here.

59
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:05,759
Leave me here then.

60
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,839
Thank you
for accompanying me all this while!

61
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,600
Can I accompany you forever?

62
00:05:59,240 --> 00:05:59,879
Hey!

63
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,600
Wait!

64
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,680
Ningmeng!

65
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,959
Wait!

66
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,800
Ningmeng!

67
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,600
Ningmeng!

68
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,079
Ningmeng!

69
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,720
Who are you?

70
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,160
Have you forgotten?

71
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:23,360
I sent you back last night.

72
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,279
Sorry.

73
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,160
I was drunk.

74
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,159
I don't want your money.

75
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,519
It's my first time doing this too.

76
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,120
Your first time?

77
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,159
Were you a virgin?

78
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,000
I have to pay extra

79
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:00,879
for your first time.

80
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:03,200
I don't need your money.

81
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,679
Sorry.

82
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,120
I hurt you.

83
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,480
Take this.

84
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,080
Pretend you never saw me.

85
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:13,679
No.

86
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,480
Well...

87
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,639
I'm Luo Nan.

88
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,360
What's your name?

89
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Calm down.

90
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:28,919
Really?

91
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:29,759
Indecent.

92
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:31,360
Uncle!

93
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,639
Uncle!

94
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,240
Don't push.

95
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,080
Ningmeng.

96
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,000
What happened?

97
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,320
I can't bring myself to say it.

98
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,159
Ms. Tian.

99
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,679
Mr. Li showed us.

100
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,799
Your striptease live stream

101
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,360
is inappropriate.

102
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,639
It's indecent.

103
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,039
Jeez.

104
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:48,960
It's indecent.

105
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,840
You embarrassed us.

106
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,480
What were you doing?

107
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,360
Stop it.

108
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,970
I was the one
who instructed Tian Ningmeng to stream.

109
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,080
If there's anything, come at me.

110
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:59,200
Here.

111
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,159
No, Ningmeng.

112
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,799
I'm not criticizing you.

113
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,159
Do you think

114
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,720
you can face your elders
after messing around with him?

115
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:10,960
Li Ji, you scum.

116
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,480
Ningmeng is in this state
because of you.

117
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,360
Li Ji.

118
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,039
I'll fight you!

119
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,919
This guy.

120
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:19,360
What are you doing?

121
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:26,480
Ningmeng.

122
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:28,480
Look, you made things hard for me

123
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:30,919
after what you've done.

124
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:33,639
We're running a homestay.

125
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:35,200
Yeah.

126
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,600
It's indecent.

127
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,320
What has become of this ancient town?

128
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,639
Dear fellow villagers,

129
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:42,559
I admit that what I did was wrong.

130
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:45,679
But I hope
you'll give me two more weeks.

131
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,860
I can definitely
get the homestay up and running.

132
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:51,320
Or I will bear all the losses.

133
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,600
How are you going to bear it?

134
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,919
Anyone can say that.

135
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:56,840
Easy for you to say.

136
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,879
Ningmeng learned live streaming from me.

137
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,000
She had no choice.

138
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,840
She's doing her best

139
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,639
to protect our ancient town.

140
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:07,480
Look at you all,

141
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:08,960
treating her like this.

142
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,200
How about this?

143
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,399
Give Ningmeng two more weeks.

144
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,200
Okay?

145
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,240
I'll vouch for her.

146
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,759
I'll vouch for her.

147
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:18,440
Alright.

148
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,559
Let's disperse.

149
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:21,039
Let's go.

150
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,720
Give him face.

151
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,919
Give him face.

152
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,120
Are you okay?

153
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm fine.

154
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:36,480
Luo Nan.

155
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,200
Take Ningmeng home.

156
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,130
What are you going to do?

157
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:42,360
Don't worry.

158
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:43,840
I'm fine.

159
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,480
I'll solve

160
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,279
your problem.

161
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,720
Luo Nan.

162
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,360
I'll go first.

163
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:51,919
No problem.

164
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,639
I won't allow you to hit him.

165
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:30,200
Why are you here?

166
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,279
You little brat.

167
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,720
Holding a brick is illegal.

168
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:38,080
What does it have to do with you
if I break the law?

169
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,759
Why are you so disobedient?

170
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,000
Do you know him?

171
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,759
No.

172
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:50,519
Oh.

173
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,600
I got it.

174
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:53,519
Are you following me

175
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,799
because you're worried about me?

176
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:57,200
Worried about you?

177
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,200
Little brat.

178
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,639
You're young,

179
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:02,000
but you're quite proud.

180
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:03,840
There's nothing then.

181
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,790
I'll continue fighting.

182
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,720
Hey.

183
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:07,039
Come back.

184
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:11,759
Miss.

185
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,039
I don't have to fight.

186
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,000
Meet me at the bar tonight.

187
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:16,879
Okay?

188
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:19,960
We were just impulsive.

189
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,799
I won't go.

190
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:23,919
You were impulsive,

191
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,240
but I wasn't.

192
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,559
See you at the bar tonight.

193
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,000
I told you I wouldn't go.

194
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:30,600
You're not coming?

195
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,360
