=Episode 15=

7
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,200
Mr. Ao.

8
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,920
To what do I owe the pleasure?

9
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,159
Tian.

10
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:57,079
I'm here to follow up

11
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,320
on our contract.

12
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,799
This time,

13
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:12,480
I've come with the full sincerity
of the board of directors.

14
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:14,640
I want to make this place

15
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,000
a paradise.

16
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,200
No.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,200
Heaven.

18
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:21,519
Mr. Ao.

19
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,920
We can feel your sincerity.

20
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:26,799
I wonder if you have any plans.

21
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:30,640
This place is so old.

22
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,580
It doesn't have
any sense of modern technology.

23
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,000
Mr. Ao.

24
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,920
The antique charm

25
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,280
is our feature here.

26
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,640
It has a lot of charm.

27
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:42,400
Antique charm?

28
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,040
That's right.

29
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:46,000
I'll let all our service staff

30
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,159
wear high-slit cheongsams.

31
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,680
Oh, that's good.

32
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,079
High-slit cheongsams?

33
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:53,120
No.

34
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:56,079
Tear down this wall

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,560
and insert a steel pole

36
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,480
in the middle.

37
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,200
Steel pole?

38
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,439
Yep.

39
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,599
It's practical and artistic.

40
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,479
This compound is quite big.

41
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,879
Here.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,680
Dig a swimming pool.

43
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:16,680
Yes.

44
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,719
Dig all the way here.

45
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:20,919
Install stages

46
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,680
at the sides.

47
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,240
Install lights and sound system.

48
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,800
Installing stages are a bit too much.

49
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,000
Mr. Ao, we originally planned

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,960
to build a children's
calligraphy teaching area there.

51
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,719
Yes.

52
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:33,199
Children?

53
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:35,960
You're a genius.

54
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,840
Cosplay.

55
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,919
Divide this into several rooms.

56
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,599
This is hospital.

57
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:46,879
That's a restaurant.

58
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,039
This is a school.

59
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:49,599
Great.

60
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:50,639
Give customers

61
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,319
a different experience.

62
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,439
No, Mr. Ao.

63
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,800
Your plan sounds a bit

64
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:58,759
obscene.

65
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,439
How is it obscene?

66
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,039
It's art.

67
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,280
But we're building an ancient town.

68
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,520
Ancient town?

69
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,439
Yes.

70
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,520
Oh.

71
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,120
Ancient Town.

72
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,919
Oh, we wanted to build a stage
for the ancient town,

73
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,120
but Tongnan

74
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,800
is right between Chengdu and Chongqing.

75
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,199
It's the perfect location,

76
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,639
so I decided to open a nightclub

77
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:28,159
in Shuangjiang Ancient Town.

78
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,719
Universe Nightclub.

79
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,360
Mr. Ao.

80
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,120
Is that what a big company
like yours do?

81
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,319
What's the matter?

82
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,360
You dress so fashionably,

83
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,280
but why are you so conservative?

84
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:40,879
Huh?

85
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,439
I won't agree to it.

86
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,759
I won't agree either.

87
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:54,120
Have you seen the contract?

88
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,680
Huh?

89
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,319
I signed it.

90
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,879
Mr. Ao.

91
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,560
Do you think the project is feasible?

92
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:12,120
Not bad. Good idea.

93
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,400
It's now or never.

94
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,680
Let's sign the contract.

95
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,560
We've already signed the contract.

96
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,000
If it's alright with you,

97
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,920
the contract will be effective
once you sign it.

98
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:40,560
According to the contract,

99
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,879
I have absolute control.

100
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,079
Mr. Ao.

101
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:46,399
I think you didn't see it clearly.

102
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,600
The contract clearly states

103
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:51,480
whoever invests the most money

104
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,879
will have the absolute control.

105
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,040
Yeah.

106
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,800
That's why I brought two million yuan.

107
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:56,879
I'll

108
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,319
invest in the company right away.

109
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:00,360
And then,
I'll become the legal representative

110
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,720
and have absolute control
over this project.

111
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,879
Ms. Tian.

112
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,240
You're gorgeous.

113
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,279
How about

114
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,199
becoming the general manager

115
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:12,959
of my company?

116
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:13,879
Watch your words.

117
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:14,639
Forget about it.

118
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,720
I'm telling you.

119
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,480
And you.

120
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,240
Forget about causing trouble here.

121
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:21,319
Throw him

122
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:22,800
out of here.

123
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:23,399
Hey.

124
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,519
What are you doing?

125
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,879
What are you doing?

126
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:26,360
Put me down!

127
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,199
What are you doing?

128
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,340
Otherwise, I won't go easy on you.

129
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,319
Put me down!

130
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:30,759
Ao Daman.

131
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,680
What are you doing?

132
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:32,879
Tell them to let go!

133
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:33,720
You can't hit me.

134
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,600
Put me down!

135
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,279
You can't hit me.

136
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,720
Ao Daman!

137
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,160
You...

138
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,720
Oh.

139
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,639
Protect me!

140
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,720
I'll see if any of you move.

141
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,040
Scram.

142
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,839
Scram.

143
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,190
I'll see if any of you move.

144
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:53,959
I, Shuangjiang's Bruce Lee,
am no pushover.

145
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,560
Come on.

146
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,879
Fight me.

147
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,920
I'm not scared of you. Come on.

148
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,800
Come on.

149
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,680
Fight me.

150
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,480
I'll beat you up.

151
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,839
Scram.

152
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,680
Come on.

153
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,399
Ningmeng, one word from you,

154
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:59,000
and they can't leave the Ancient Town.

155
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,160
It's a misunderstanding.

156
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:02,759
It's a misunderstanding.

157
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:05,959
We're Tian Ningmeng's business partners.

158
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,040
Ao Daman.

159
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,240
This is between the two of us.

160
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,720
Don't involve others.

161
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,399
If you want the penalty fee,

162
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:13,600
feel free to sue me.

163
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,519
Ms. Tian.

164
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,759
Because you believed in light,

165
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,199
I will allow you

166
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,839
to fulfill the contract
in these few days.

167
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,040
But you can't afford

168
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,800
the penalty fee!

169
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:24,920
What did you say?

170
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,319
Run!

171
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,160
Hurry.

172
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,600
Wait for me.

173
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,519
Hurry, Sir.

174
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,319
Get in.

175
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,839
My head

176
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,079
is swollen.

177
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,199
You've worked hard.

178
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,079
Tian

179
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,199
has quite a temper.

180
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,519
I like her.

181
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,600
What about our genius plan
for the nightclub?

182
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,279
Open.

183
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,920
We're opening it.

184
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:24,079
Alright.

185
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:24,680
Sir.

186
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,800
I'm waiting to making money with you.

187
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:56,679
I heard
Ao Daman gave you trouble after all.

188
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,720
Ningmeng.

189
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,240
I'm quite worried about you.

190
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,759
I have a solution for you.

191
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,120
This

192
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,759
is a transfer contract.

193
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,120
Transfer the company

194
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:13,159
to Mr. Ao, and it'll be terminated.

195
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,639
And everything's settled between us.

196
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,960
Don't hold me accountable

197
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,799
for embezzling company funds either.

198
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,279
Li Ji.

199
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:24,399
Turns out that's what you

200
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,559
went to all this trouble for.

201
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:28,600
Ningmeng.

202
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,679
I'm helping you.

203
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:31,960
Don't do this.

204
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,159
You're broke now.

205
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:38,360
You brought Ao Daman here, didn't you?

206
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,759
But you signed

207
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:43,840
the contract.

208
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,540
(Transfer Contract)

209
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,980
(Transfer Contract)

210
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,159
Given our years of relationship,

211
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:01,000
I didn't want to pursue
your embezzlement of company funds,

212
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:03,840
but now

213
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:07,360
I've decided to pursue it.

214
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:26,639
Where did you go?

215
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,759
Ningmeng.

216
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,639
Cheer up.

217
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:33,720
No matter what happens,

218
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,600
we'll figure it out somehow.

219
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:42,200
Do you think

220
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,320
life has meaning?

221
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:51,519
When desires are satisfied,

222
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,000
you'll be bored.

223
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,480
It's miserable when you don't get it.

224
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,879
Is hard work really effective?

225
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,720
We can find a balance

226
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,960
between boredom and misery.

227
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,720
Yeah.

228
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,799
Maybe the balance

229
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,480
is giving up.

230
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,399
Do you want to give up on yourself,

231
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:28,679
give up on your dreams,

232
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,759
and give up your life?

233
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:35,000
I can't let anyone get involved anymore.

234
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,639
Especially you.

235
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:41,080
Whatever happens,

236
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,519
I'm always here.

237
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,279
Ningmeng.

238
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,200
Ningmeng.

239
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:47,600
(IOU, Tian Ningmeng
Borrowed 158,000 Yuan From Caramel)

240
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:52,320
(Caramel.)

241
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,960
(Thanks for your company.)

242
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:57,399
(I'm thankful for you.)

243
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,600
(I'm thankful
for everything you've done for me.)

244
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:04,200
(Apart from my grandfather
who raised me,)

245
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:09,000
(you're the only silly man
who treats me so well.)

246
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,960
(But I admit I'm timid.)

247
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,559
(I'm scared of falling for you)

248
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:16,080
(just because you treat me well.)

249
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:20,279
(If you can't continue
treating me well in the future,)

250
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,279
(I don't know how to face it.)

251
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:24,360
(I'm not worth your efforts.)

252
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,919
(I don't want you to get hurt
because of me either.)

253
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:30,919
- Ningmeng!
- (So I'm leaving.)

254
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:32,080
Ningmeng!

255
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,919
(Don't look for me.)

256
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,240
(Go on with your life.)

257
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,600
(Maybe one day
when my problems are solved,)

258
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,000
(we'll meet again.)

259
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,039
(But I can only say)

260
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,720
