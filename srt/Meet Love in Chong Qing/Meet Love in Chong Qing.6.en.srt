=Episode 6=

7
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:47,079
You're really special.

8
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:48,290
Someone even bought you a dish.

9
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:50,840
Ah.

10
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,240
If you like it,

11
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,479
I'll bring you here more often.

12
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:56,479
How generous.

13
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:57,960
Well...

14
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,520
How can I ever repay you?

15
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,280
We're friends.

16
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,280
There's no need
for repayment between friends.

17
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,719
You're playing hard to get.

18
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,159
You're quite a gentleman.

19
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,840
Do you know what the most beautiful time
between two people is?

20
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,280
Tell me about it.

21
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:21,640
When you just met and hit it off.

22
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:23,120
I

23
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,439
just want

24
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,400
this time

25
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:28,560
to be longer.

26
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:31,480
You're a gentleman and a romantic.

27
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:32,719
You're also handsome.

28
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,760
Your girlfriend...

29
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,359
Your ex-girlfriend

30
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,959
is really blind.

31
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:52,799
Tingting.

32
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:53,879
I had a great time with you

33
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,840
today.

34
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:55,719
Me too.

35
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:57,480
What's the matter?

36
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,599
Can you go back on your own?

37
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,560
Of course.

38
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,760
This is my turf.

39
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:03,480
Okay.

40
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,380
Let's get in touch

41
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,840
on WeChat.

42
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,790
Be careful on the road.

43
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,520
Bye.

44
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:29,199
Hello?

45
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,639
Lianlian.

46
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,400
I just finished my work.

47
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,599
What are you doing?

48
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:35,680
How are you?

49
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,240
I miss you very much.

50
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,560
Really?

51
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,800
What happened?

52
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,639
Are you upset that I called you?

53
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,639
Babe.

54
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,080
Do you know what scares me the most?

55
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,479
I know.

56
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:53,280
You

57
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,879
must think
I'm too involved with Tian Ningmeng

58
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,010
and that she'll steal me back

59
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:59,000
after all the interaction.

60
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,719
Yes.

61
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,360
I'm scared.

62
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,759
I'm more afraid
of falling in love with a lion,

63
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,759
but

64
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,560
he likes a pride of lionesses.

65
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,080
I'm not the only one he loves.

66
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:12,560
I know.

67
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,039
I understand.

68
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,560
Sorry.

69
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,639
Never mind.

70
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,159
You should come back to Beijing soon.

71
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,599
Hey, Lianlian.

72
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:23,319
I...

73
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,919
I had an emotional affair.

74
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,479
Emotional affair?

75
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,479
How long will it be
before you have a physical affair?

76
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,120
I met

77
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,520
a girl today.

78
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,080
I had a good time chatting with her.

79
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,080
I think

80
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:42,319
I had an emotional affair.

81
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,960
It doesn't matter.

82
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,400
You haven't

83
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:48,159
had a physical affair yet, right?

84
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,400
If it becomes an established fact,

85
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,599
its nature will be different.

86
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:56,240
Sorry.

87
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,520
Are you asking

88
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,520
for a breakup?

89
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,520
No.

90
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,879
You know what?

91
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:03,879
Two people in love

92
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,350
need to be honest with each other.

93
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,120
Because only honesty

94
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,360
can please the other party.

95
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,120
If you're not honest,

96
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,690
you're not loving your partner enough.

97
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,800
If you really can't accept it,

98
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,680
we can break up.

99
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:19,879
No.

100
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,600
It

101
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:24,680
hasn't become a fact yet, right?

102
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,839
Let's not break up, okay?

103
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:28,839
Lianlian.

104
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:30,399
You know what?

105
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:31,800
I'm especially glad

106
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,720
that between you and Tian Ningmeng,

107
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,710
I chose you because you
understand the bigger picture,

108
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,639
know your limits,

109
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,000
and are tolerant.

110
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,120
Compared to Tian Ningmeng,

111
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,319
you love me more, right?

112
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,319
Of course I love you the most.

113
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,639
I don't want to lose you at all.

114
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:49,560
That's why

115
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,079
I want to be honest with you.

116
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,480
You know what?

117
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:55,360
I really...

118
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,519
I don't want to lose you.

119
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,160
Thank you.

120
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,879
Thank you for being honest with me.

121
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,759
I really love you.

122
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:08,879
I love you too.

123
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,120
Hey.

124
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:31,519
Lianlian.

125
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:33,439
Where are you?

126
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,759
I...

127
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,439
I'm at home.

128
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:39,920
You're at home?

129
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,480
Oh, you know what?

130
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,560
I met a girl

131
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,959
when I was with my client today.

132
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,290
She looks particularly like you.

133
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,120
Is that so?

134
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,519
Then...

135
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:52,120
Then I'll go to Guangzhou to find you.

136
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,160
No.

137
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,439
Don't bother.

138
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:58,240
I'm going back in a couple of days.

139
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:01,519
I don't know why,

140
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,920
but you're all I've been thinking about.

141
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,000
Looks like

142
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,319
I love you very much.

143
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,639
Really?

144
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:08,920
Promise me

145
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,720
that you won't leave me

146
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,170
and will take me with you
wherever you go.

147
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:15,000
Don't leave me alone, okay?

148
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,560
I promise

149
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,920
I'll take you with me

150
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,560
wherever I go.

151
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,410
We'll never separate.

152
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,079
Okay?

153
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:21,759
Okay.

154
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,720
Li Ji.

155
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,079
Li Ji.

156
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:44,279
I'm not Li Ji.

157
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:47,040
Don't leave me.

158
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:51,199
Why did you leave me?

159
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:58,040
Why did you cheat on me
with my best friend?

160
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:06,360
She seduced you, didn't she?

161
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,199
Haven't you recognized me

162
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:14,160
as Ling Feng yet?

163
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,040
Ling Feng?

164
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:22,319
Who's Ling Feng?

165
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,399
Hey, Lianlian.

166
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,000
It's getting late.

167
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:29,680
I spent

168
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,160
the whole day with my client today.

169
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,759
I'm tired.

170
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:35,720
Why don't we

171
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:37,279
rest early?

172
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,079
Remember to miss me.

173
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,240
Don't worry.

174
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,160
I will.

175
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,240
Good night.

176
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:47,399
I love you.

177
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,920
Tian Ningmeng.

178
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,199
Ningmeng.

179
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,079
Was it you today?

180
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,519
I'm doing research at Tongnan Hotel.

181
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,500
(WeChat, You received a WeChat message.)

182
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,920
(Li Ji)

183
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,280
Ningmeng.

184
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:24,360
Was it you today?

185
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:26,199
I'm doing research at Tongnan Hotel.

186
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,279
I want to know more about the homestay.

187
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:29,480
I know

188
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,120
you're not really angry at me.

189
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:32,200
Don't worry.

190
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,220
I'll quietly support you
from behind the scenes.

191
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,790
I'll wait for you to come back anytime.

192
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,480
Stop texting my girlfriend.

193
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:42,279
This is a serious warning.

194
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,780
(Tian Ningmeng)
This is a serious warning.

(Delete Contact)

196
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,840
Li Ji.

197
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,600
Li Ji.

198
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,700
(Delete Contact)

199
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,639
Hello?

200
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:26,200
I just finished dinner.

201
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,190
The guy I met today is definitely
tall, rich, and handsome.

202
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,039
I think he likes me very much.

203
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,399
He's going to be mine.

204
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:50,639
Ms. Liu.

205
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:53,440
I saw that woman left on her own.

206
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,240
They're only friends.

207
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,100
They're only having a meal together.

208
00:09:58,879 --> 00:09:59,840
Friends?

209
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,559
I don't think
they look like ordinary friends

210
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:04,200
when they parted ways.

211
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,120
It doesn't matter.

212
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,919
Ms. Liu.

213
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,000
Look at what he has done.

214
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:14,559
Why don't you break up with him?

215
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:15,879
Yueyue.

216
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,159
Li Ji is the man I love most.

217
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,480
He's not just a friend with benefits.

218
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,039
I believe

219
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,000
I said everything I needed to say

220
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,320
on the phone

221
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,680
and gave all the face
that needed to be given.

222
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,559
Hmm.

223
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:32,399
He's probably already noticed.

224
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,360
If I expose him now,

225
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,320
there's no way we can be together again.

226
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:40,240
Ms. Liu.

227
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:42,399
He manipulated you.

228
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,559
If you love a man deeply,

229
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:48,919
you should accept him as he is.

230
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,639
You know what? Yueyue.

231
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,759
He confessed to me
that he had an emotional affair.

232
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,200
That takes a lot of courage.

233
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,039
Sorry, Ms. Liu.

234
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,840
I just want the best for you.

235
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,799
I understand you now.

236
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,840
This

237
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,879
is all my fault.

238
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,360
Your fault?

239
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:11,440
I shouldn't have

240
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,799
stolen my best friend's boyfriend.

241
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,679
Nor should I follow him to Tongnan

242
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,519
and spy on him.

243
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,039
I really should...

244
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,440
I should give him some space.

245
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,490
I shouldn't have done this.

246
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,639
I really shouldn't.

247
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:27,120
Ms. Liu.

248
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,039
Men.

249
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,440
Especially

250
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:37,200
handsome men.

251
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:41,159
It's inevitable that they get attention
from other women.

252
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,000
I can

253
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,000
understand all that.

254
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,600
I can understand.

255
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,200
Get up and drink some water.

256
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:51,840
Get up and drink some water.

257
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,279
Come on.

258
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,279
Be careful.

259
00:13:58,919 --> 00:13:59,960
Drink some water.
