00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,840
Come on.

8
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:12,079
Wait.

9
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,400
Slow down.

10
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,239
Come on.

11
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,840
Come on.

12
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,159
Is this how you like it?

13
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,439
You don't like it?

14
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,319
Do you like it?

15
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,080
Wait.

16
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,319
Where did you go?

17
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,520
Are you playing

18
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:09,240
hide-and-seek with me?

19
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,919
Sweetheart.

20
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,960
You're playing hide-and-seek with me.

21
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,360
Lianlian.

22
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,639
Why are you here?

23
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,879
You don't want to see me?

24
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,240
Of course I want to see you.

25
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,560
What are you trying to do?

26
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,840
Untie me.

27
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,840
It's hurting me.

28
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,759
Don't you like to attract
bees and butterflies?

29
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,680
Today, I'll let you
attract them to your heart's content.

30
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,479
Hey, don't do this.

31
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,360
Hey, no.

32
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,599
Lianlian.

33
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:47,639
Hey, you...

34
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,599
Don't do this here.

35
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,240
If you want to do this,

36
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:52,439
let's go home.

37
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:52,800
Ah.

38
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,080
Untie me first.

39
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:55,520
No.

40
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:56,599
Lianlian, you...

41
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,000
Hey.

42
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:00,080
Lianlian.

43
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:03,439
No.

44
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,680
Hey.

45
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,240
Let me explain.

46
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:13,319
Lianlian.

47
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,000
Lianlian.

48
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,160
Is there some kind of misunderstanding
between us?

49
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,279
I can explain.

50
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,959
Are you trying to manipulate me again?

51
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,839
I know you're here.

52
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:33,920
That's why I came here on purpose.

53
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,680
I came here to see you.

54
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:38,399
Hey.

55
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,800
Lianlian.

56
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,040
You...

57
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,279
What are you doing?

58
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,240
Lianlian.

59
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:44,279
Hurry.

60
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,399
Untie me.

61
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,720
Let me explain.

62
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,920
Lianlian.

63
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,120
Once or twice is fine,

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,319
but will I always be like this?

65
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,040
Release me.

66
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,360
Lianlian, hey.

67
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,480
Ah!

68
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,279
Liu Lian.

69
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,279
Release me.

70
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,600
Release me.

71
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:29,439
Ms. Liu.

72
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,879
Where are we going?

73
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,079
Do you want to try

74
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,839
the best liangfen here?

75
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,519
Darling.

76
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,720
Where am I supposed to find you
in such a big place?

77
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,399
I found you.

78
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,440
Let me borrow your bike!

79
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:50,960
Hey, my bike!

80
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,720
My bike!

81
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,240
You still have feelings for Caramel.

82
00:08:58,519 --> 00:08:59,320
Caramel!

83
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,480
Ningmeng.

84
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,639
Caramel!

85
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,480
Caramel!

86
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,120
It's time to get him back.

87
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:15,480
Caramel!

88
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:17,480
Caramel!

89
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,080
Caramel!

90
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,559
Caramel!

91
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:22,080
Uncle?

92
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:24,000
Why are you here?

93
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,840
How did you know I was here?

94
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,039
Where's Caramel?

95
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:30,039
How would I know?

96
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,360
Why are you here?

97
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,480
You have his car.

98
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,720
Where is he?

99
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,879
Oh, Caramel

100
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,120
had someone give me this car.

101
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:41,559
He said it might be useful to you later.

102
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,840
Do you want to use it?

103
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,360
No need.

104
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,240
Oh.

105
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,039
What's going on with you two?

106
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:55,639
He was going to propose that day.

107
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,679
Propose?

108
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,039
He

109
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,039
asked me to keep this too.

110
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:31,540
(Entrance)

111
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:54,960
Is this the love you said

112
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,559
would never disappear?

113
00:10:57,879 --> 00:10:58,919
Yes.

114
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:00,240
This is the love I said

115
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,360
would never disappear!

116
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,919
A man

117
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,919
once told me

118
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:19,399
under a shooting star

119
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,759
that

120
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,279
true love

121
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,240
would never disappear.

122
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,000
His love for me

123
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,440
is as pure and beautiful

124
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:36,879
as this field

125
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,519
of rapeseed flowers,

126
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:44,720
but I hurt him deeply

127
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,320
on a rainy night.

128
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,720
Today,

129
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,159
I'm going to

130
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:55,440
propose to him here.

131
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,200
If you still love me

132
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,080
and accompany me
to finish the rest of my journey,

133
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,679
please find me.

134
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,559
I'll be waiting for you here.

135
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:13,380
(Tian Ningmeng, I'm Li Ji.
I knew you still love me. Wait for me.)

136
