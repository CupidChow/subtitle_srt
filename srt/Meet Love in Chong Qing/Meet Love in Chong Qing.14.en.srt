=Episode 14=

7
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:57,359
You scared me.

8
00:00:58,159 --> 00:00:59,679
You settled everything.

9
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,240
Why didn't you wake me up yesterday?

10
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,719
I was worried you might be too tired,

11
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,120
so I just let you get your beauty sleep.

12
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:07,280
Look.

13
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,159
It worked.

14
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,000
You look beautiful
even without makeup today.

15
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,439
Thank you.

16
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,280
It's good to have you here.

17
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,959
I changed the name of your live stream
to Ningmeng Homestay.

18
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:36,280
Here, look.

19
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,680
This is where we'll record our first video.

20
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:41,959
This is what we're going to record.

21
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,640
But I'm still traumatized
by my last live stream.

22
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,599
I'm a little nervous.

23
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,560
It's okay.

24
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,439
Just be yourself.

25
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:56,280
We're recording this.

26
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,359
It's not a live stream.

27
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,079
Don't worry.

28
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,159
Okay.

29
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,400
I'll give it a try.

30
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:03,159
Be careful.

31
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,640
Should I just hold on like this?

32
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,039
Let's start.

33
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:08,719
Okay.

34
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:12,759
It won't budge.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,360
Let me help you.

36
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,520
It's a bit heavy.

37
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,199
It's too heavy.

38
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,800
Here, let's do it together.

39
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,639
One, two, three.

40
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:24,560
Again.

41
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,960
One, two, three.

42
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,479
Let me switch positions first.

43
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,400
Together.

44
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,039
Come on.

45
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,960
One, two, three.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,080
It still won't budge.

47
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:44,319
What do we do?

48
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,240
Is the switch not turned on?

49
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,719
Ah!

50
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,960
Ah!

51
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,159
Turn it off!

52
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,639
Hurry!

53
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,159
Hurry!

54
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,120
The switch.

55
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:01,560
Turn it off.

56
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,199
Look at you.

57
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,199
Don't move.

58
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,800
Don't take photos.

59
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:16,520
Don't take photos.

60
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,879
Hello?

61
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,039
What?

62
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:25,840
Live stream.

63
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,879
Live stream?

64
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:31,000
Turn it off.

65
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:38,000
Gosh.

66
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,990
Do you know how many messages
we have received in our backend?

67
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,719
They're all asking about our homestay.

68
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,000
Oh no.

69
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,080
My butt is going to be famous.

70
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,919
It's already famous.

71
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,680
What do we do then?

72
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,400
Hurry and change your pants.

73
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,439
Stop laughing at me.

74
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,160
What were you doing?

75
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,360
The vibe is just right.

76
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,040
I can't help myself.

77
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,519
Can't you kiss more seriously?

78
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,700
I'm going to start driving.

79
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:43,920
Come clean.

80
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,959
Since when

81
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,519
did you start to like me?

82
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:52,319
It was love at first sight.

83
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,519
Now

84
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,240
until the future.

85
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:23,879
You

86
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:27,399
got me out

87
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,000
of a wrong relationship.

88
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,240
Can you promise me that you'll never

89
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:37,959
lie to me

90
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,959
and hurt me?

91
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,600
I promise

92
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,720
I'll never hurt you

93
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,319
and lie to you.

94
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,360
True love is not possession

95
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:21,720
but giving.

96
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:26,079
But I want to thank you

97
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,879
for everything you've done for me.

98
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,360
Is your love for me

99
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:35,159
out of gratitude

100
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,480
or from the heart?

101
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,360
Ningmeng.

102
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,639
Go hide.

103
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:45,120
Hide.

104
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:45,960
Ningmeng.

105
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:47,399
Ningmeng.

106
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:48,360
Luo Nan?

107
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,480
Caramel.

108
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,320
Why are you here?

109
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:51,639
I have good news for her.

110
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:52,720
Ningmeng.

111
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,399
Just tell me what you have to say.

112
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,940
There's a Mr. Ao who said he wants to
rebuild the ancient town.

113
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,440
Rebuild the ancient town?

114
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,430
I have to tell Ningmeng.

115
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,039
Ningmeng!

116
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:00,600
Luo Nan.

117
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,879
She's not here.

118
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,120
Go back first.

119
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,240
We'll drop by soon.

120
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,440
How could she not be here?

121
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,070
She's really not here.

122
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,759
Ningmeng!

123
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:07,840
She's really not here.

124
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:09,360
Ningmeng, I have good news!

125
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,480
What's the matter with you?

126
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,370
She's really not around.

127
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,240
Go.

128
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,399
We'll be there soon.

129
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:20,600
What did he say?

130
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,600
He mentioned a Mr. Ao.

131
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,000
Mr. Ao?

132
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,679
What is this place?

133
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,240
This

134
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,039
is Ao Capital's team-building base.

135
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,639
Mr. Ao is inside
doing team-building activities.

136
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,320
Is Mr. Ao wealthy?

137
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,639
He's wealthy.

138
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,700
Money is no issue for him.

139
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,799
Later, our company's funds will be secured

140
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,320
once he approves.

141
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,559
Isn't that inappropriate?

142
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,120
Don't worry. I'm here.

143
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:03,799
Come on.

144
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:05,919
Let's go.

The rich

149
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,720
are eccentric.

150
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:09,679
Mr. Ao?

151
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:10,600
Yeah.

152
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,879
