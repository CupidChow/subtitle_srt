Caramel.

9
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,280
I'm here.

10
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,680
What are you doing up there?

11
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,519
Someone is taking wedding photos
over there.

12
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,519
What's this?

13
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:28,519
I'm

14
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:32,120
not ready yet.

15
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:34,200
This is my birthday present to you.

16
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,120
It's so beautiful.

17
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,200
I like it.

18
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,000
Here.

19
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,519
I'll put it on you.

20
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,240
What do you think?

21
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,400
It looks good.

22
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,000
Look.

23
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,560
This large rapeseed field

24
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:55,599
is the second stop
of our travel agency's Tongnan tour.

25
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,079
It's really beautiful here.

26
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,519
Hey, Ningmeng.

27
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,760
You're dressed so beautifully today.

28
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,400
Let me take a photo for you.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,920
Sure.

30
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,039
How was it? Let me see.

31
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:14,680
How about this?

32
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,280
Let's use this photo

33
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,560
as a promotional photo
for our company image.

34
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,520
This will give us better publicity.

35
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:25,680
Here. Look back.

36
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,719
Look back.

37
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:29,039
Hey, amazing.

38
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:31,439
One, two, three.

39
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,400
Okay.

40
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,159
What do you think? Does it look good?

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,460
All that matters is that you like it.

42
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,120
Let’s take a photo together.

43
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:02,800
I hate taking photos.

44
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,439
You can take photos of yourself.

45
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:42,240
Hello?

46
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,080
Uncle.

47
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:43,840
Ah, yes.

48
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,240
Something happened on the way.

49
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,840
I'll reach Tongnan tomorrow.

50
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,840
Yeah.

51
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,400
What smell is that?

52
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,280
I feel like I'm almost going rancid.

53
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,919
Let's find a hotel
where we can take a shower

54
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,560
and get rid of the bad luck.

55
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,360
Okay.

56
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,479
Let's get two rooms.

57
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:06,680
It's my treat.

58
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,960
What happened to your watch?

59
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:17,360
I probably lost it somewhere.

60
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,240
This

61
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,279
is quite different from the picture.

62
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,759
A five-star rating?

63
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,839
The internet said this hotel

64
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,199
is unique.

65
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,439
There must be a surprise.

66
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,060
(Liu Lian)

67
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:41,519
Forget it.

68
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,279
(Liu Lian)
This will do.

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,920
I'll get my luggage.

70
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,439
Okay.

71
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,900
(Liu Lian)

72
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,680
Stay out of my business.

73
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,600
Stop calling me.

74
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,040
That's all. Bye.

75
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,639
Let me help you with that.

76
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,040
Hello, Boss.

77
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,720
Boss.

78
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,600
Did you book a hotel

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,600
or an adult store?

80
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,279
I don't know.

81
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:36,680
Do you have a booking?

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,360
Ah.

83
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,720
No.

84
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,199
Are you two a couple?

85
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,600
Ah, no.

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,439
We want two rooms. Thank you.

87
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:45,319
Oh.

88
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,079
That's a shame.

89
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,680
You were supposed to be our 100th couple

90
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:51,759
could get our free couple suite.

91
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:54,560
Free?

92
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:55,439
Yeah.

93
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,480
Really?

94
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,279
Do I look like I'm joking to you?

95
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:02,879
Yes, we're a couple.

96
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,920
My boyfriend was kidding you.

97
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:08,519
I'm a joker.

98
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,480
What are you doing?

99
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:17,519
I'm broke
and don't want to owe you a favor.

100
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:19,839
We'll be sharing the same room then.

101
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,079
You can sleep in the RV if you refuse.

102
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:25,000
Oh, you're too cruel.

103
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,040
Sir and Miss.

104
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,360
There's only one room left.

105
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,439
Do you want it?

106
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,600
Yes.

107
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,920
Of course.

108
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,319
Enjoy your stay.

109
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:37,920
Thank you.

110
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,920
Hey, handsome.

111
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,120
Thank you.

112
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:46,360
Hey.

113
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:48,360
Here.

114
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:50,759
What's this?

115
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,970
The mysterious surprise
our store has prepared for you.

116
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,000
No. I don't need it.

117
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,079
Remember to leave a good review.

118
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:55,800
I don't need it.

119
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,879
What are you doing?

120
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,780
You did this on purpose, didn't you?

121
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,040
What do you mean?

122
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,439
You were being sneaky just now.

123
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,439
What did you tell the staff?

124
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,319
I didn't say anything.

125
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,199
Do you have any improper ideas about me?

126
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:39,519
There's no way
I'll have any improper ideas about you.

127
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,600
I'm not good enough, am I?

128
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:40,879
Oh.

129
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:42,160
That's not what I meant.

130
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,439
You misunderstood.

131
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,319
Hand it over!

132
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,600
No.

133
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:48,240
Give me!

134
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:48,930
Don't snatch it.

135
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,360
No.

136
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,199
No.

137
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,399
My...

138
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,399
My...

139
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:00,959
And you said
you didn't have any improper ideas.

140
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:01,560
No.

141
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,639
They're not mine.

142
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:04,800
Give me.

143
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,079
No.

144
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,240
Give me.

145
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:07,240
No.

146
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:09,319
Get off me!

147
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:10,399
I'll get off if you give them to me.

148
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:10,920
Get off!

149
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,720
I got them!

150
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:13,079
Stinky pervert!

151
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,399
And you said
you didn't have any improper ideas.

152
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,560
Scram!

153
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:20,600
No.

154
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,439
Let me explain.

155
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,240
Oh.

156
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,360
Oh.

157
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,910
I was much stronger than him
when I was young.

158
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,920
Look at him and then look at yourself.

159
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,800
Ah.

160
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:33,960
Ah.

161
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,720
Sorry, Sir.

162
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,759
Did I disturb you?

163
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,120
Young people have a lot of tricks.

164
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:51,919
Hmph.

165
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,039
Not bad.

166
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,519
Tsk.

167
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:55,320
Come on.

168
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,799
Hey.

169
00:08:58,799 --> 00:08:59,840
Come in.

170
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,000
Ah.

171
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:08,440
Ah.

172
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:11,080
Ah.

173
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,759
How dare you look?

174
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,080
Why are you still here?

175
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,720
I didn't.

176
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,700
Continue looking.

177
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:14,440
Get out!

178
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,360
How dare you look?

179
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,120
Don't hit me.

180
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,240
Stop hitting me.

181
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,600
Stop.

182
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,960
(Congratulations for Grand Opening
Beijing Ningmeng Travel Agency)

183
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,679

Beijing Ningmeng

It's 3 o'clock.

189
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,000
What?

190
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:46,120
He's gone?

191
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:48,960
Isn't it normal for a man
to leave after he's done?

192
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:52,000
I want to check out.

193
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,480
What are you doing
so early in the morning?

194
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,960
Sorry.

195
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,120
I didn't mean to scare you last night.

196
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:16,360
Oh, yes.

197
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,200
I searched the whole night

198
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:22,120
and found it in the rapeseed field.

199
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,759
Here.

200
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:32,480
Thank you.

201
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,200
Hey.

202
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,840
Handsome.

203
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,240
Our free couple room requires you
to take a photo of you kissing each other.

204
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:38,840
Ah?

205
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,990
Otherwise, you will need to pay
a fee of one thousand yuan.

206
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
A kissing photo?

207
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,740
You didn't tell us
when we checked in yesterday.

208
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:44,399
Yeah.

209
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,480
Ignore her. Let's go.

210
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,240
Hey!

211
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:48,440
Hey, wait.

212
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,600
Hey.

213
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:52,840
Just pose for the photo.

214
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,100
You don't need to kiss for real.
