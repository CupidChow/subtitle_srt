7
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:43,679
Brothers.

8
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:45,140
Welcome to my livestream.

9
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,430
Don't panic when things go wrong.

10
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:48,250
Have a bowl of liangfen
to ease your sorrow.

11
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,039
Join me
in smacking your lips with delight.

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,039
Come and see.

13
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,240
Let's get high!

14
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,079
Brothers.

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,959
Give me a like, okay?

16
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,239
His style is quite unique.

17
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,670
Even a liangfen shop
has also started live streaming.

18
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,280
Brothers.

19
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,680
Someone's here.

20
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:16,120
Yeah.

21
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,359
It's really a big change.

22
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:20,359
But I hope the liangfen tastes the same.

23
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:23,359
Where's Madam Meng Lu?

24
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:25,400
Hey.

25
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,120
My mother got drunk again,

26
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,519
leaving me alone as a backup.

27
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:29,920
Pity me for being all alone.

28
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,450
I just hope my mom will come back soon.

29
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,680
Liangfen is five yuan.

30
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,620
Do you want some chili?

31
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,420
After eating liangfen,
tap the follow button.

32
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,840
I'll give you a discount.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,040
Thank you, Brothers.

34
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,120
Two bowls of liangfen. Both spicy.

35
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,439
I also want more garlic.

36
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,920
Okay!

37
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:45,920
Brothers.

38
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,640
Now.

39
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,760
I'm going to start
making Tongnan liangfen.

40
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:00,280
The old liangfen shop in your hometown

41
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,840
is so unusual.

42
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,599
I swear

43
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,560
it wasn't like this before.

44
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,560
Your liangfen is ready.

45
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,000
Enjoy!

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,599
Thank you.

47
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,319
I now think

48
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,100
he is losing a lot of money
by selling us a bowl of liangfen

49
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,240
for five yuan.

50
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,719
It smells the same.

51
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:33,400
Stir it up.

52
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,680
Mmm.

53
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,240
It's so yummy.

54
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:44,240
Try it.

55
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,360
Mmm.

56
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,039
The taste is really special.

57
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,000
Let me tell you.

58
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,719
Tongnan's noodles

59
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,599
are a mix of three types of noodles.

60
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:58,199
And this one has a unique recipe.

61
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:00,520
It's the only one.

62
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,280
It's indeed pretty good.

63
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,180
Of course.

64
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,039
I was almost desperate

65
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,599
when I first got here.

66
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,240
I'm telling you.

67
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,039
This shop

68
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:13,639
used to be the most popular place.

69
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,400
The owner's name is Meng Lu.

70
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,159
She's very pretty.

71
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,360
We call her Liangfen Beauty.

72
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,520
Really?

73
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,439
Why didn't we see her today?

74
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:24,879
Yeah.

75
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,000
Let's go dancing.

76
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,919
Oh, come on.

77
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,039
No.

78
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:33,840
Oh.

79
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,879
Come on.

80
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,080
Come.

81
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:37,280
Let's go.

82
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,080
No.

83
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,960
Let's go.

84
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,240
What are you doing?

85
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,840
No, I really can't dance.

86
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:47,240
Brothers.

87
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,159
Next, we have Beauty and the Beast.

88
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:51,240
Let's get high, shall we?

89
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,599
Who's Beast?

90
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:54,120
Let's get high!

91
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:56,280
Let's dance.

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,800
Let's get high!

93
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:00,400
Thanks for the super sports car!

94
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,120
Let's hype up the place, shall we?

95
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,390
Did the lady dance well?

96
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,800
You want to see the lady dance?

97
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:10,719
Hit follow, okay?

98
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,719
The lady is starting to dance.

99
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:16,319
Thank you for the gift!

100
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:18,240
Follow our number one supporter, okay?

101
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,360
Thank you for the carnival!

102
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,319
Carnival!

103
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,759
Okay.
Follow our number one supporter, okay?

104
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:26,120
You can get a carnival?

105
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,399
It's a carnival. You don't know.

106
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:29,800
Your turn.

107
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,560
Hey.

108
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,560
I can't do it.

109
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,199
Support the host, okay?

110
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:34,990
Hit the follow button!

111
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:35,959
Okay.

112
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,360
Let's get Beast

113
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,360
to show us a dance.

114
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:39,480
Who's Beast?

115
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,040
No, I can't.

116
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,680
You can do it.

117
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,800
Let's hype up the place!

118
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,360
Start!

119
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,000
Get high!

120
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:51,519
Come on.

121
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:54,399
Shall we get the lady to dance again?

122
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,519
Thank you for the gifts. Thank you!

123
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,170
We're on the trending rank.

124
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:01,879
Thank you.

125
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:03,079
Thank you for the support!

126
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,879
Give us a like, okay?

127
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,560
Let's dance.

128
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,519
Come on.

129
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:10,199
Thank you!

130
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,839
Thanks Yisong for another carnival.

131
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:13,759
Buddies.

132
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,439
I'm going to end the livestream now.

133
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:15,959
Let's

134
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,079
meet again tomorrow, okay?

135
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:22,000
I've never danced.

136
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,639
How tiring.

137
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,680
Thank you for being here today.

138
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,319
I've never met a carnival.

139
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,380
That's three thousand yuan.

140
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:29,959
Yes.

141
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,780
You don't need to pay
for the liangfen today.

142
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,560
I'll close the shop
after you finish eating.

143
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,639
Is live streaming so profitable now?

144
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,290
But it depends on your luck.

145
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,000
Ningmeng.

146
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,710
If you want to live stream,
contact me anytime.

147
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,680
Hahaha.

148
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,240
Sure.

149
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,040
Hey.

150
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,920
Why are you closing the store so early?

151
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,639
Oh, I got a singing gig at a bar.

152
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,160
Many residents nearby have moved away.

153
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,460
There are few customers.

154
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,279
My small shop
isn't doing that well either.

155
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,890
Where's Madam Meng Lu?

156
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,320
How come I don't see her?

157
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,759
My mom's in the hospital.

158
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:57,600
Oh.

159
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,680
I've been looking after this shop
for over a year.

160
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,160
I wanted to close it,

161
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,199
but my mom refused.

162
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,079
What's wrong

163
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,040
with Madam Meng Lu?

164
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,199
Is it serious?

165
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,560
Uremia.

166
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,160
She can't do heavy work.

167
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,279
It's quite serious.

168
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,759
How did it happen?

169
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,959
Ningmeng.

170
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,800
I heard you're taking over
all the homestays in the ancient town.

171
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,800
You can always contact me
if you need help.

172
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:22,680
Thank you.

173
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:23,399
Luo Nan.

174
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:24,920
Don't mention it, Ningmeng.

175
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,480
Thank you for today.

176
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,639
I've made money
for my mom's medical bills.

177
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,319
Ningmeng.

178
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,910
If you can make
the homestay business a success,

179
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,959
my business will also be saved.

180
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:40,639
I'll try my best.

181
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,800
Thank you, Ningmeng.

182
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:56,300
(Shuangjiang Ancient Town)

183
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:25,920
There are no stars tonight.

184
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,639
I set up this starry sky for you.

185
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,639
When I was little,

186
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,879
I will stargaze

187
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,960
here

188
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,039
at night

189
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,559
whenever I feel down.

190
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:52,679
Do you like it?

191
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:57,799
Yes.

192
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:04,080
What's on your mind?

193
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm wondering

194
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,120
if you feel lonely
when you stargaze here

195
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,279
as a child?

196
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,360
I did.

197
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,000
Whenever I feel lonely,

198
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:24,639
my grandpa

199
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,840
would tell me ghost stories.

200
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,440
Don't girls like fairy tales?

201
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,320
My grandfather said

202
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,960
I need to be brave and strong
all the more precisely because

203
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,519
I'm a girl.

204
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,799
Can you

205
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:00,120
stay here with me tonight?

206
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,519
Don't overthink it.

207
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,039
I just feel

208
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,600
a little lonely right now.
