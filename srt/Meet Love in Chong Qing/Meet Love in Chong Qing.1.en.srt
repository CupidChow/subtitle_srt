=Meet Love in Chong Qing=

6
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,980
=Episode 1=

7
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,180
(Jiangbei Airport
Chongqing Urban Area)

8
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,060
(Chongqing)

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,159
(I'm Tian Ningmeng.)

10
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,600
(After graduating from university,)

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,280
(I started a travel company
with my best friend.)

12
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:59,920
(We agreed
to travel the world together,)

13
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,799
(but now)

14
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,239
(I'm the only one
running away from debt)

15
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,000
(all over the world.)

16
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:09,120
Stop!

17
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,480
Don't run!

18
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:17,439
Ms. Tian.

19
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,100
Come back with us.

20
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,860
It's just a small amount of money.
Pay us.

21
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:22,159
Go after her!

22
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:29,599
Get in.

23
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,599
Where could she run?

24
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,400
Don't let her escape again.

25
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:38,359
Let me go!

26
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,319
Quiet.

27
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:40,599
They're coming over.

28
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:41,719
She's gone.

29
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:43,000
Someone's outside.

30
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:47,040
Go look for her over there.

31
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,920
Don't move.

32
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,920
I won't hurt you.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,940
Did you hear something?

34
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:07,920
Let's block the exit.

35
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,560
Thank you for earlier.

36
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,479
You're hurt.

37
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:16,639
Here, sit.

38
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:19,960
I have iodine here.

39
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,919
Help me.

40
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,680
It might hurt a little.

41
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,479
Please bear with it.

42
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,280
Are you a medical student?

43
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,240
Oh, I'm not.

44
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,879
I'm a travel blogger.

45
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,719
A travel blogger?

46
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:50,000
You should be good
at chatting people up.

47
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,280
Oh, you misunderstood.

48
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,790
I was going to travel to Tongnan,
but I saw someone chasing you.

49
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,800
Help me open my luggage.

50
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:55,800
Oh.

51
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,400
Give me that pink outfit.

52
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,759
Thank you.

53
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,159
Are you going to Tongnan?

54
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,759
Yes, I heard Tongnan has the prettiest
rapeseed fields in the country.

55
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,639
What a coincidence.

56
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:16,840
I'm from Tongnan.

57
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,510
There are many delicious foods
in Tongnan.

58
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:22,879
Why not take my car
and go to Tongnan together?

59
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,360
I'm afraid it's dangerous
for you to go alone.

60
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,639
Sure.

61
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,780
Let me introduce myself formally.

62
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,240
I'm Caramel.

63
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,639
Tian Ningmeng.

64
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,680
Your name is Ningmeng?

65
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,319
I'm Caramel.

66
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,759
Sweet and sour.

67
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,360
How amazing.

68
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,680
When we reach Tongnan,

69
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,560
I'll thank you.

70
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:52,439
Just take me to see
Tongnan's beautiful scenery.

71
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,759
Let's go.

72
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,840
Isn't this the car we saw just now?

73
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,639
It's Tian Ningmeng!

74
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,840
It's her!

75
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:07,550
Stop the car!

76
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:15,199
She got away again.

77
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,990
(I didn't expect the scenery
along our way to be so beautiful.)

78
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,639
(The itinerary says
there's an observatory up ahead.)

79
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,279
We're here.

80
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,959
Let's camp here.

81
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,660
(Key Project Area for Comprehensive
Development of New Modern Agriculture)

82
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,639
The night view is indeed beautiful.

83
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,519
Ningmeng.

84
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,399
Look.

85
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:15,800
Our travel agency set this to be
the first stop of the Tongnan trip.

86
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,600
The observatory.

87
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,439
Li Ji.

88
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,560
It's so beautiful.

89
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,560
Thank you.

90
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,519
Oh.

91
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,279
Sagittarius love lock?

92
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,680
I heard that Sagittarius and Leo
are a good match.

93
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:48,199
Scumbag!

94
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,720
Hey, what are you doing?

95
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:53,439
How did a Sagittarius offend you?

96
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:55,959
I'm not talking about you.

97
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,439
It's a shooting star.

98
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,399
Hurry and make a wish.

99
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,199
It's useless to make a wish.

100
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,519
How is it useless?

101
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,600
Everyone said

102
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,920
wishing on a shooting star
can help you find true love.

103
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,079
Do you believe in love?

104
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:24,879
Yes.

105
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,140
What about you?

106
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,279
I don't believe it anymore.

107
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,600
Love is like a shooting star,

108
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,600
gone in the blink of an eye.

109
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,240
True love

110
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,720
will never disappear.

111
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,519
There will be no more stars.

112
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,839
Look, that's me!

113
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,800
Sagittarius.

114
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:56,680
It's 26 thousand light years from Earth.

115
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,439
That's you, Leo.

116
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:04,639
Seven light years from Earth.

117
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:07,439
I see it. It's bright!

118
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,279
Its light

119
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:12,120
can only be seen after a long time.

120
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,480
The Leo we see now

121
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,439
is actually the Leo seven years ago.

122
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,600
No one

123
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,519
can see

124
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,279
the entire galaxy except us.

125
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:27,040
Although these two beams of light
were once extremely far apart,

126
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,040
they meet at this moment.

127
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:33,639
A light that travels through thousands
of years is only meaningful now.

128
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,759
It will never disappear.

129
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,240
Is this the love you said

130
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:41,759
would never disappear?

131
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,959
Yes.

132
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,199
This is the love I said

133
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:46,720
will never disappear!

134
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,639
Ningmeng, I love you.

135
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,720
I will always be good to you.

136
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,199
Li Ji and Tian Ningmeng
will be together forever.

137
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,079
We will be together forever.

138
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:03,399
We will expand the travel agency

139
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,560
and travel the world together.

140
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,959
I want to give Tian Ningmeng the best.

141
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,920
(Lianlian,
we can finally be together officially.)

142
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,240
(Li Ji, are you serious about me?)

143
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:27,639
(Of course, my darling.)

144
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,279
Tian Ningmeng

145
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,200
