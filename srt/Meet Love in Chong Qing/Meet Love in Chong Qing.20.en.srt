=Episode 20=

7
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,159
The doctor said
you have extensive burns on your face

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,200
and a shattered liver.

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,920
Why didn't you inform your family?

10
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,399
I have no family.

11
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:03,200
Go back and check on Ningmeng.

12
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,560
Ningmeng's fine.

13
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,079
She only had a mild concussion.

14
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:10,079
You, on the other hand,

15
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,959
should take care of yourself.

16
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:16,799
She doesn't know what happened,
does she?

17
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,280
Ningmeng

18
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:21,280
didn't see the whole process.

19
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:23,959
Later, Li Ji from our class came over.

20
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,319
She thought it was Li Ji who saved her.

21
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:33,840
Can I trouble you with something?

22
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:36,159
Go ahead.

23
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,079
Don't tell Ningmeng who I am.

24
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,280
Why?

25
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:42,840
I don't want her

26
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,319
to feel guilty and upset

27
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:47,200
because of me.

28
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,599
You're severely injured.

29
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,799
Don't you want her
to know all your efforts?

30
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,079
I like Ningmeng.

31
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,480
I want her to have a happy life.

32
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,680
Pursue her if you like her.

33
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,120
Be bold and pursue her.

34
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,519
With the way I am now?

35
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,260
(Tourism Management Department Ball)

36
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,639
Sorry.

37
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,240
I'm late.

38
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,719
It doesn't matter.

39
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,680
We just got here too.

40
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,719
We didn't wait for too long.

41
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,039
Speaking of,

42
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:35,639
thank you for last time.

43
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,080
It's alright.

44
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,719
Every brave boy

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,360
would do the same.

46
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,919
Well... Let's go first.

47
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,240
Come on.

48
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,879
Let us wait with you.

49
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,719
You guys better go in first.

50
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:17,479
Liu Lian dressed up for you today.

51
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,719
Look how beautiful she is.

52
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,280
Do I look beautiful?

53
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:28,280
Yes.

54
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:30,280
Hey.

55
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,800
Who are you waiting for?

56
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:34,039
I promised someone

57
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,159
that I must wait for him.

58
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,159
How about this?

59
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:41,919
We'll fulfill this promise with you.

60
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:50,080
Let's wait together.

61
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:50,599
Okay.

62
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,400
Ling Feng spent a year in hospital

63
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,599
after the hot pot incident.

64
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,840
It took him countless
transplants and plastic surgeries

65
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,519
to become what he looks like today.

66
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,279
Then why didn't he come to me

67
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:15,600
after discharging from the hospital?

68
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,759
He did go to you,

69
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,399
but

70
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,120
he realized
you've gotten together with Li Ji.

71
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:29,600
So he chose to silently leave

72
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:31,879
and give you his blessing.

73
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:34,439
After graduation,

74
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:38,759
he worked in my company

75
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,839
and

76
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,040
went on road trips.

77
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:48,120
He shot a lot of promotional material
for your travel agency

78
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,000
during his trips,

79
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:51,920
until

80
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,920
you found me and Li Ji.

81
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,879
How did he know?

82
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:03,639
After you flew to Chongqing alone,

83
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,680
I was worried about you.

84
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,279
I was afraid you'd do something stupid,

85
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,079
so

86
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,120
I told Ling Feng about your situation

87
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,920
and what happened between me and Li Ji.

88
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,920
Ling Feng was furious

89
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,680
when he found out.

90
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,680
He followed you to Chongqing

91
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,720
and ran into you in Chongqing.

92
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,879
What about his house?

93
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,040
What's with the house?

94
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,720
After the trouble Mr. Ao caused,

95
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:39,800
Ling Feng returned to Beijing

96
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,360
and sold his only house.

97
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,680
I remember

98
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,519
that time was tight at the time.

99
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,120
He borrowed two million yuan from me.

100
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,040
The house was eventually sold at a loss.

101
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,240
I came this time

102
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,480
to give him the remaining money.

103
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:08,120
How could he be so stupid?

104
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,279
Ningmeng.

105
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,800
You're lucky to have someone

106
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,279
who loves you so much.

107
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,639
Cherish him.

108
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,199
Don't tell me what to do.

109
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,080
I admit

110
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,399
I told Ling Feng these things

111
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:42,480
to prevent you and Li Ji
from getting back together,

112
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,799
but it doesn't matter anymore.

113
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,399
The pain Li Ji caused me

114
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,400
is no less than what you suffered.

115
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:53,840
At least

116
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,759
you still have someone
who loves you very much.

117
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,480
I've driven away

118
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,960
the person who loved me.

119
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,919
Get him back.

120
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,480
I'm leaving tomorrow.

121
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,960
I sincerely apologize to you.

122
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:38,399
I hope

123
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,039
you and Caramel

124
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:44,679
can have the happiness I can't have.

125
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,120
Do you know who I am?

126
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,279
Since you know who I am,

127
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:50,600
how are you going to teach me a lesson?

128
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,919
I know you're Liu Lian,

129
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:56,879
but I really do love you.

130
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,840
Don't be silly.

131
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,440
You're just being impulsive.

132
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,840
Give birth to the baby.

133
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:14,480
Whether it's Li Ji's or mine,

134
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:16,440
I'll love it.

135
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:18,399
I'll love you too.

136
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,879
I don't deserve it!

137
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:43,559
Miss.

138
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:30,720
Pretty lady.

139
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:32,000
Are you alone?

140
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,960
Yeah.

141
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,399
Are you alone too?

142
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:30,759
Come on.

143
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,120
Wait.

144
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:57,480
