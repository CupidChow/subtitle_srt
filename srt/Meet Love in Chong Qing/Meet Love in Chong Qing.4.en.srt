7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,359
Why are you here?

8
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:44,920
Ningmeng.

9
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,000
I saw the post you published.

10
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:48,560
I know

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,880
you posted on your social media

12
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:53,000
because you can't let me go.

13
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,759
You're not only a scumbag,

14
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:57,799
but are you also an idiot?

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,280
I know you missed me.

16
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,879
Please accept my apology.

17
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:15,000
Darling.

18
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:16,280
Let's take some photos.

19
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,239
Hey.

20
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:40,200
Are you happy now?

21
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,400
Perfect.

22
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,680
Goodbye.

23
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:48,439
This

24
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,840
is our love token watch.

25
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,439
It's hard for us to get back together.

26
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:00,680
Ningmeng.

27
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,480
You won't be so cruel to me.

28
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,599
Right?

29
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,560
This

30
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,530
is my new boyfriend.

31
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,960
I haven't introduced him to you yet.

32
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,919
His name is Caramel.

33
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,759
Please don't come to me again.

34
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:19,120
I'm worried it'll upset my boyfriend.

35
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,000
So

36
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:23,039
are you dumping me

37
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,319
for this shorty?

38
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,039
He

39
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,280
might be shorter than you,

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,919
but

41
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,400
he has his advantage.

42
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,520
We are

43
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:35,840
passionate and happy

44
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,000
together.

45
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,439
Ningmeng.

46
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,479
Ningmeng.

47
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,080
Let me finish what I have to say, okay?

48
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,159
Thank you for the flowers.

49
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:49,240
Ningmeng.

50
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,280
I'll help you with it.

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,200
You were exhausted last night.

52
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,479
I feel sorry for you.

53
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,960
Silly boy.

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,970
I'll handle them myself.

55
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:04,960
Ningmeng.

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,770
I'll give you some time
to think about it.

57
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,820
(Lianlian)

58
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:20,120
Hello?

59
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,240
Lianlian.

60
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,800
Babe.

61
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,770
I just haven't seen you for a while.
Where did you run off to?

62
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,760
You didn't even attend
the first plenary session.

63
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,800
Get up.

64
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:30,680
Hello, Ms. Liu.

65
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,700
(Rose Garden)
I'm in Guangzhou.

66
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,690
After Ningmeng made a scene last time,
there were rumors all over the company.

67
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:37,400
I still want to start my own business.

68
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,639
I don't want your father
to look down on me.

69
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,719
Did you receive my flowers?

70
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,840
I received the flowers.

71
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,960
I wondered who was so thoughtful.

72
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,120
Thank you.

73
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,639
(Rose Garden)
I'm meeting a client.

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,919
Let's stop talking.

75
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:51,879
I'll hang up now.

76
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,460
I'll wait for you to come back.

77
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:54,560
Okay.

78
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,159
Ms. Liu.

79
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,759
As per your request,

80
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,120
I gave Mr. Li
our company's location-tracking phone.

81
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,800
It shows

82
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,800
his current location is near Chongqing.

83
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,240
Chongqing?

84
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:19,240
Why are you so depressed?

85
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,839
Do you want me
to give you the kiss back?

86
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,040
Stop the car.

87
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:26,519
Huh?

88
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,000
I told you to stop the car!

89
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,360
Hey, wait.

90
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,240
Tongnan is just up ahead.

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,990
Where do you want to go?

92
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,319
Shuangjiang Ancient Town.

93
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,160
What are you doing here?

94
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:29,560
We're about to separate.

95
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,720
Let me give you a gift.

96
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,319
You look good.

97
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:57,759
This suits you the most.

98
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:00,639
I think

99
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:01,839
this one

100
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,399
should be expensive.

101
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,439
Don't worry.

102
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,660
I won't avoid paying the bill.

103
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,000
Do you still have money?

104
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,079
Enough to buy this.

105
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,199
You've got
quite a lot of secret stash money!

106
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:17,920
When it's for a good friend,

107
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,800
you should give them the best.

108
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,079
Why don't you

109
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,480
also change into a suit

110
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:31,439
so that we can take a photo together?

111
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,480
Hurry over.

112
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:44,040
Three, two, one.

113
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,079
I'm going to go now.

114
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:52,279
Okay.

115
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,279
Go on.

116
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,800
Do you want...

117
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,959
I mean I'll give you your money back.

118
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:10,959
Isn't bringing up money at this moment
ruins the mood a little?

119
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,319
Keep in touch.

120
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,439
Okay.

121
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:18,920
Good luck in everything.

122
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:28,000
Thank you.

123
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,040
Don't mention it.

124
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:32,480
It's just doing a small favor for you.

125
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,360
I'm going to go now.

126
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,279
Okay.

127
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,080
Lemon ice cream.

128
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,720
What a coincidence.

129
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,200
Yeah.

130
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,159
Are you free

131
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,039
later?

132
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:25,320
Yes.

133
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:28,240
Let me buy you a meal.

134
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:30,440
Really?

135
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,960
I'm meeting my uncle and his family

136
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,360
for a meal at the mahjong parlor.

137
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,000
Why don't you put on a show with me?

138
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,320
Am I acting as your boyfriend?

139
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,200
You wish.

140
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,000
Act as my chauffeur.

141
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,559
Oh.

142
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:49,200
No.

143
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:52,480
I'm just scared they'll worry
seeing me like this.

144
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,399
I'm your creditor.

145
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,840
You want me to be your chauffeur?

146
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,000
Not only do you
have to play the chauffeur,

147
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:02,159
but

148
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,120
you're also mute.

149
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,420
I was afraid you'd say nonsense.

150
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,080
No.

151
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,519
Isn't that a little too much?

152
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:09,279
If you refuse, I...

153
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,039
Hey.

154
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:12,200
Okay.

155
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,279
Fine.

156
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,840
I'll play along with you for once.

157
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:17,600
Just once.

158
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,399
Ningmeng.

159
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:24,039
It's our family dinner today.

160
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,200
Help yourself.

161
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:27,120
Let me introduce you...

162
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:28,320
Ningmeng.

163
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,950
Mr. Liu has been named the commerce
representative of the ancient town.

164
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:32,799
You finally came back.

165
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:35,440
Lead us to develop
our hometown's cultural tourism.

166
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,159
Your uncle

167
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,440
knows you like wine.

168
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:40,990
He bought it especially for you.

169
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,300
There are no Chinese characters.

170
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,159
Call her Ms. Tian.

171
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:44,799
Uncle.

172
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:47,879
She's a businesswoman
who runs a company in Beijing.

173
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,519
Don't use your seniority
to act all high and mighty. Got it?

174
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,780
Speaking of which,

175
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,159
is the guy next to you

176
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:55,200
your boyfriend?

177
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,519
Ah.

178
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,120
No.

179
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:56,720
Uncle.

180
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,320
He's my chauffeur,

181
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,440
but he's mute.

182
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:02,840
Uncle.

183
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,759
Don't call me Ms. Tian.

184
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,559
Mr. Liu, call me Ningmeng.

185
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,399
It sounds closer.

186
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,600
I knew it.

187
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,799
The boyfriend Ningmeng brought last time
was handsome.

188
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,759
This one looks silly.

189
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,600
How could you say that?

190
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:16,799
Didn't you hear Ningmeng say
he was just mute?

191
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:18,039
You don't know if he's deaf.

192
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,000
The mute can hear.
It's the deaf that can't.

193
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:25,000
Oh, look.

194
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:26,320
He's just mute,

195
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,480
not deaf.

196
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,639
Yeah, Mr. Liu.

197
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:34,919
Ms. Tian.

198
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:37,879
The old house in our alley

199
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:39,320
was going to be demolished.

200
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:42,200
Yet you said you want to lease it
and open a guesthouse.

201
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,919
The villagers are very grateful to you,

202
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,240
but the villagers
have moved out a long time ago.

203
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:48,720
When is your guesthouse

204
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,200
going to open for business?

205
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:52,519
Mr. Liu.

206
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:54,990
Last time you told me

207
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,960
that you discovered a gold mine
in our old house.

208
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,679
What gold mine?

209
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:02,200
You told me on the phone last time.

210
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,559
Gold mine.

211
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,240
I did say that.

212
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,620
(Ten Days Ago, Beijing)

213
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,140
(Beijing Ningmeng
International Travel Agency)

214
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,879
Why are you crying? It's late.

215
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,440
You woke up the kids.

216
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,350
I'll call the police
if you continue crying.

217
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,180
(Chongqing's Mr. Liu Wen)

218
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,879
Hello? Mr. Liu.

219
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:53,279
Where have you been?

220
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,950
Your uncle and I have been
looking for you everywhere.

221
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,600
We've nearly gone crazy.

222
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,039
Oh.

223
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:57,919
I was a bit busy

224
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,600
some time ago.

225
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,759
Hey, Ningmeng.

226
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,559
We found a gold mine

227
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
in our ancient town.

228
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,000
What?

229
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:10,320
Didn't you represent us villagers
to start a homestay business?

230
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,639
We've been waiting for you to come back
and make the decision.

231
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:13,759
Really?

232
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:15,039
Don't you believe me?

233
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,990
Even if you don't trust me,
do you not trust your uncle?

234
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,080
I do.

235
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,320
I'll book a flight and come back.

236
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:37,559
I'm saved.
