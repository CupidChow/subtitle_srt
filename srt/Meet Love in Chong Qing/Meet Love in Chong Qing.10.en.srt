7
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,320
Hey, Ningmeng.

8
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:54,840
Luo Nan.

9
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,439
Ningmeng.

10
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:56,960
My mom asked me to give this to you.

11
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,200
What's this?

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,740
My mom said it's not easy for you
to lead everyone in running a homestay.

13
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,810
She wanted to support you.

14
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,439
I can't take this money.

15
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,079
Luo Nan.

16
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:05,640
I can't take it.

17
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,760
Ningmeng, take it.

18
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,239
Otherwise, my mom will be upset.

19
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:21,000
Luo Nan.

20
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:21,760
Hey.

21
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,120
What kind of live streaming
is the most profitable nowadays?

22
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,480
Beautiful streamers
make the most money right now.

23
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,370
Just dance,
and many people will give you gifts.

24
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,959
All you have to do is dance?

25
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,840
Besides dancing,
add in some live stream effects.

26
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:35,400
Make some performance.

27
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:37,280
Performance?

28
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,840
Yes.

29
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,959
Performances are vulgar.

30
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,040
We have no choice.

31
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,330
You make money by being humble

32
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,719
and exchanging dignity for money.

33
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,000
Can't we

34
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,159
earn

35
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,760
this money with dignity?

36
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:53,879
If you're popular,

37
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,000
you'll have dignity.

38
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:56,879
Yes.

39
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,000
Fame equals money,

40
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,959
and money equals dignity.

41
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:03,680
Hey.

42
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:04,560
Ningmeng.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,670
You're not going to live stream,
are you?

44
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,439
It's embarrassing.

45
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,680
What dignity do I have now?

46
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,840
I just want to keep the old house.

47
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:14,960
Luo Nan.

48
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:15,680
Yeah.

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,199
Help me apply for an account.

50
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,719
Let's live stream together.

51
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,199
Sure, no problem.

52
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:21,759
Coming.

53
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:22,759
The liangfen is coming.

54
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,800
Ningmeng, don't worry.

55
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,400
I want to make money.

56
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,039
(Xinglong Street Compound)

57
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,039
Hello, everyone.

58
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,680
I'm AKA DJ Nannan.

59
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,560
Let's welcome our new streamer,

60
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:42,879
Tongnan Sweetie,

61
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,080
to make her debut!

62
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,400
(Is she new? She's a good dancer.)
That's right. It's her first day.

63
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,000
Follow us.

64
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,420
(She has a great figure.
A beautiful new streamer?)

65
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,780
(Her legs reaches my chest.)

66
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,960
(Now that's dancing. Mesmerizing legs.)
There's a heart in the lower right.

67
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,479
(Darling. You have a great figure.)
Tap it for free, okay?

68
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,639
(Give me a kiss.)
Tap on it, guys.

69
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,280
(It's scary that they have zero fans.)
Thanks for the gifts.

70
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,599
(Follow us to support her.)
Tap on the follow button.

71
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,639
(Chongqing girl, where's Tongnan?)

72
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:19,439
Thanks for the super sports car.

73
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:21,759
Tap on the heart
in the lower right corner, okay?

74
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:22,919
(How old are you?
How tall are you?)

75
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,319
(Are you going to continue dancing?)
Thank you for your support.

76
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,800
(I'm also from Chongqing.)
The dancing won't stop

77
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,840
if the gifts keep coming.

78
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,900
(Continue dancing. Don't stop.)

79
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,980
(I've been to Tongnan before.)

80
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,780
(I want to see the streamer dance live.)

81
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:41,940
(I'll send the sports car right away!)

82
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,520
Thank you for the super sports car,

83
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,719
level 60's Dashing Gentleman.

84
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,159
Next,

85
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,400
our dancing won't stop.

86
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:02,900
(Where are you? I'll come find you.)

87
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:03,879
That's right.

88
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,919
(You're wearing too much clothes.)
It's her first day.

89
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,160
She's live streaming.

90
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:26,040
You asked me here,

91
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,879
but you keep watching live streams.

92
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,040
What's the meaning of this?

93
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,079
It's important.

94
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:38,519
Thank you for your support.

95
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:40,980
Let's dance and get high!

96
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,160
(Beauty, do you know who I am?)

97
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,839
(Keep on dancing.)
Our popularity is 500, 700.

98
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,199
(Beautiful girls are realistic.)
Support us.

99
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:49,360
(Awesome, looks good, great dancing.)
We have 5,800.

100
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,199
(You ask for gifts as soon as I'm here.)
Keep it up.

101
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,759
We're on the recommendation list now.

102
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,199
(This figure stunned me. She's good.)
Thank you for the recommendation.

103
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,100
(That direct?)

104
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,460
(You're being recommended
on the homepage.)

105
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:02,160
(You're being recommended.)
Keep it up.

106
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,199
(You're so cute and good at dancing.)
Thank you, buddies.

107
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,380
(Are you new? Where are you from?)

108
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,020
(Why are you wearing so many clothes?
Are you cold?)

109
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,180
(Those nice legs
are ruined by those clothes.)

110
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,140
(How long are you live streaming?)

111
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,700
(You're so cute.)

112
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,060
(You're so good at dancing.
Continue dancing.)

113
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,340
(Why do you wear so many clothes?
Are you cold?)

114
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,500
(Are you cold?)

115
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,839
Thanks to level 60's

116
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:30,120
Dashing Gentleman
for the super sports car!

117
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,560
Amazing.

118
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,360
(I want to see the legs!)
Next, we'll dance.

119
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,560
Ningmeng.

120
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,600
We're being recommended.

121
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,399
Let's work harder.

122
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,959
Hurry.

123
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,040
People here have a saying.

124
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,720
Don't treat your guests Taian fish.

125
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,120
They will feel uneasy.

126
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,300
(You're wearing too much clothes.
Take it off.)

127
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,660
(Take off your clothes.)

128
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,020
(Great figure.)

129
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,759
(Take it off.)
Don't stir things up.

130
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,340
(Take it off.)

131
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,340
(Take it off.)

132
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:42,079
It's the streamer's first day.

133
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:43,680
(Keep on dancing. Shake.)
She's giving you a small gift

134
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,120
(What are you wearing inside?)
to thank you for the support.

135
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,800
Send us gifts.

136
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,639
Tap on the heart.

137
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,180
(Continue taking off your clothes.)

138
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,720
(You're really good.)

139
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,319
Tap on the heart.

140
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,120
Tap on it.

141
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,879
I underestimated you, Ningmeng.

142
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,639
You act cool with me

143
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,959
but wild on the live stream.

144
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,260
(How provocative.)

145
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,220
(The streamer is doing a striptease.)

146
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,420
(Continue taking off your clothes.)

147
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,900
(If you lack money, find me.)

148
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,020
(How much per night?)

149
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,439
(Do you lack money?)
Thank you for the support.

150
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,720
Thank you for the support!

151
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,800
(Keep on dancing.)
Tap on the heart.

152
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,839
Our streamer will continue dancing.

153
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:39,959
We're already second place.

154
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,600
Keep it up, everyone.

155
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:47,800
(Come out and accompany me.)

156
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,279
Don't stir things up.

157
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:52,199
(Where are you?)
Shall we keep dancing?

158
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,140
(Take it off. Go on.)

159
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,680
(Keep on dancing, and you'll get gifts.)
Don't lead the conversation off track.

160
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,060
It's the streamer's first day dancing.

161
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,000
Let's support her, okay?

162
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,380
(No, take off the clothes.)

163
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,360
(What a nice streamer.)

164
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,399
Follow us.

165
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,480
(Good work deserves to be rewarded.)
She's working very hard.

166
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,639
(Boys, the holiday is here.)
Okay?

167
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,300
(You work so hard.)

168
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,460
(You're well-endowed.)

169
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,620
(You have such a nice figure.)

170
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,860
(What more could one ask for
when you have a great figure? Go on.)

171
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,800
Ningmeng.

172
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,240
Ningmeng

173
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,140
(Go on removing your clothes.)

174
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,660
(What is this? Did you set it up?)

175
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,519
Ningmeng, be careful.

176
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,240
Here.

177
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,759
Ningmeng, are you okay?

178
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:55,080
You scared me just now.

179
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,039
Why did you fall all of a sudden?

180
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm fine.

181
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,840
I haven't exercised for a long time.

182
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,360
I have low blood sugar.

183
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,799
Drink some water.

184

Ningmeng.

185
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,519
Ignore those comments.

186
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,519
They're just losers
who like to talk big.

187
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,720
How much did we get?

188
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,639
It's already five thousand
when I end the live stream.

189
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,279
It's worth it.

190
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:25,519
Ningmeng.

191
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,840
Listen to me.

192
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,200
You're a successful businesswoman.

193
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,580
You don't have to do this
for such a small amount of money.

194
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,190
What successful businesswoman?

195
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,200
Without money,

196
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,720
I'm nothing.

197
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,159
I want to make money quickly

198
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,039
to keep our old house

199
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,279
and start the homestay.

200
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,399
Ningmeng.

201
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,039
Drink some water.

202
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,720
I'm fine.

203
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,840
Li Ji, Pan Tingting?

204
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,879
Your husband
is on the second floor, room 282.

205
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,799
Thank you.

00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:47,360
Why are you leaving just after one time?

214
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,200
Didn't we agree
on one day and one night?

215
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,000
Be good. I have something to do.

216
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'll leave first.
