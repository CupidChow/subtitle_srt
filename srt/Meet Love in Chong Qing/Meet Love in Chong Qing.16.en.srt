00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,090
♪The night breeze
is swallowing me tonight♪

2
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:18,660
♪If this can take away my loneliness,
it's still considered gentle♪

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,900
♪Someone lit a fire in my eyes♪

4
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:34,040
♪It's like giving me a guilt-free joy♪

5
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,420
=Meet Love in Chong Qing=

6
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,980
=Episode 16=

7
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:53,020
(To My Sweetest Ningmeng)

8
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,840
(You are helpless and lonely)

9
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,308
(in the high-speed train station.)

10
00:01:02,845 --> 00:01:05,314
(Life isn't always
what you expect it to be.)

11
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:07,439
(You cry silently)

12
00:01:09,142 --> 00:01:10,685
(by the river.)

13
00:01:11,074 --> 00:01:13,142
(If you hadn't looked back that day,)

14
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,474
(would I still
be able to take care of you?)

15
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:21,165
(That night, you lit up
the endless darkness）

16
00:01:22,445 --> 00:01:24,514
(like a flame.)

17
00:01:25,645 --> 00:01:28,240
(You light up
my already unrecognizable heart.)

18
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,890
(The starlight is nothing
compared to even a fraction of you.)

19
00:01:33,085 --> 00:01:35,577
(And flowers are nothing
compared to even a thousandth of you.)

20
00:01:37,394 --> 00:01:41,348
(What gave me the right
to stay by your side,)

21
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,440
(protect you,)

22
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,840
(hug you,)

23
00:01:47,428 --> 00:01:48,548
(and kiss you)

24
00:01:50,228 --> 00:01:51,828
(from behind.)

25
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,662
(There's no such thing
as love at the wrong time,)

26
00:01:54,662 --> 00:01:57,140
(only chance encounters
that are better seized than delayed.)

27
00:01:57,794 --> 00:02:00,171
(The most spectacular river
we've ever seen together)

28
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:01,805
(is the river of stars in the sky.)

29
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,902
(The most beautiful sea
we've seen together)

30
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,405
(is the endless sea
of ​​rapeseed flowers.)

31
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,771
(Thank you for letting me meet you.)

32
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,028
(The most beautiful Ningmeng
in my heart.)

33
00:02:13,405 --> 00:02:15,017
(Will you be my girlfriend?)

34
00:02:19,508 --> 00:02:22,925
(I wish for your smile
to always shine brightly.)

35
00:02:23,337 --> 00:02:24,925
(As long as you smile,)

36
00:02:25,462 --> 00:02:27,851
(I will be the happiest man
in the world.)

37
00:02:29,805 --> 00:02:32,308
(Even if the road ahead is difficult,)

38
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,045
(I have nothing to fear)

39
00:02:36,514 --> 00:02:38,342
(as long as I see your sleeping face)

40
00:02:39,748 --> 00:02:41,394
(and hold your hand.)

41
00:02:43,645 --> 00:02:45,942
(Let me accompany you
on the road ahead.)

42
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:48,331
(I love you.)

43
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,719
Come down quickly. It's dangerous.

44
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,520
Don't do anything rash.

45
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,879
Calm her down.

46
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,560
We're finding her family.

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,400
Hey, who are you? What are you doing?

48
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,199
I'm her family.

49
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,560
We finally found you.

50
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,880
She has been crying for 40 minutes.

51
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:15,759
Why did you come so late?

52
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:16,039
Hurry up.

53
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:16,719
Go up there.

54
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:32,719
Hurry.

55
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:33,680
Over there.

56
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:37,560
Ningmeng.

57
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,280
Ningmeng.

58
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,759
Why are you here?

59
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,879
It's me,

60
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:46,680
Caramel.

61
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,100
Who told you
to secretly take photos of me

62
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,319
and published them
without using a beauty filter?

63
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:52,639
Alright.

64
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,039
I won't publish

65
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,439
without your consent anymore, okay?

66
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,919
It's dangerous here.

67
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:00,610
How about
you come down and talk about it?

68
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,639
Don't come over!

69
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,439
Caramel.

70
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,400
Can you promise me something?

71
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,560
Go ahead.

72
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,639
I'll promise you anything.

73
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,240
I want to solve

74
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,360
this problem myself.

75
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,319
I'll do whatever you say.

76
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,759
Luopan Mountain Swine
has a breeding history

77
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,839
of more than one thousand years
in Chongqing.

78
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,319
Black swine's growth cycle is very long.

79
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:57,279
It's flesh is delicious

80
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,199
and nutritious.

81
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,800
And it's rich in protein.

82
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:02,319
It's high-quality
healthy and beauty meat.

83
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,920
If the meat is cured,

84
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,399
it will have a longer shelf life

85
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,399
and better flavor.

86
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,439
It smells do good.

87
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:12,879
Let me show you our black pork.

88
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,839
Next, I would like to recommend

89
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:18,079
Tongnan's Ningmeng.

90
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:19,360
That's right.
It has the same name as me.

91
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,240
No, I have the same name as it.

92
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,160
You know what?

93
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,279
Tongnan

94
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:26,399
is known
as the international lemon capital.

95
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,920
The lemons we produce

96
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,480
are exported overseas.

97
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,000
Do you know the national export rate?

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,920
40%

99
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,040
of lemon exports

100
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,600
come from Tongnan.

101
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,199
You can see that this lemon

102
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,360
is juicy

103
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,360
and sweet.

104
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,879
And it has a very high vitamin content.

105
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:46,399
Eating it regularly

106
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,800
can improve immunity

107
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,360
and promote digestion.

108
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,399
If you drink a glass of lemon water
like this every day...

109
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:54,680
Mmm.

110
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,839
It's not sour at all.

111
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,000
It can also whiten your skin.

112
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,920
Next,

113
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,480
let me introduce

114
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,759
Tongnan's...

115
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:03,759
Ningmeng.

116
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,160
Take a break.

117
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,839
You've been streaming
for 15 hours today.

118
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,399
Luo Nan.

119
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,480
How much did we sell today?

120
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,360
About 60 thousand or 70 thousand.

121
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,759
It's getting higher day by day.

122
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:18,240
Let me see.

123
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,680
How long will it take
to save up this money?

124
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,079
Ningmeng.

125
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,120
I'll talk to the others
and figure out another way.

126
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,360
Let's deal with Mr. Ao together.

127
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,639
I can't trouble them anymore.

128
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,940
(Capital International Airport)

129
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:56,480
Thank you.

130
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,600
Call me if you need me.

131
00:06:58,079 --> 00:06:58,800
(Houses For Sale)
Take care.

132
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,820
(Houses For Sale)

133
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:07,959
(Houses For Sale)
Ms. Liu.

134
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,759
I'm in Beijing.

135
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,199
Let's do as you say.

136
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,040
I'll mortgage my house to you.

137
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,000
Ningmeng.

138
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,319
Good luck!

139
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,040
Good luck!

140
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,720
Luo Nan!

141
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,680
Why are you here?

142
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,480
It's about Mr. Ao.

143
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,079
There's something I want to tell you.

144
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,160
Okay.

145
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,120
Today's negotiation

146
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,279
is the beginning
of our journey to wealth.

147
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:33,919
So

148
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,559
you must perform well. Got it?

149
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,840
Is Mr. Ao

150
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,440
reliable?

151
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,200
What did you say?

152
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,360
Of course he is.

153
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,480
We met at an international

154
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,279
franchise investment conference.

155
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,159
They're a large financial conglomerate.

156
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:50,000
I've never met a big shot.

157
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,559
But Mr. Ao's company

158
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,799
is quite mysterious.

159
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,159
He's also

160
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:57,639
a little eccentric.

161
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,080
In short,

162
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,120
let's just

163
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,120
cooperate well,

164
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,240
no matter what happens.

165
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,240
Mr. Ao.

166
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:09,720
Mr...

167
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,679
This is our investor,

168
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:13,279
Mr. Ao.

169
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,279
Mr. Ao.

170
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,200
This is our local partner, Mr. Liu.

171
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,279
Mr. Ao, nice to meet you.

172
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,919
I'll take over from here.

173
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,399
Our organization

174
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,879
is all about credibility.

175
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:39,960
We haven't reached
an agreement with Ms. Tian.

176
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,799
Ms. Tian?

177
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:44,080
Are you talking about Tian Ningmeng?

178
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,080
She already ran away.

179
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,480
Ignore her, Mr. Ao.

180
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:48,440
Run away?

181
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,639
She

182
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:51,039
invited me here.

183
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:56,759
Tian.

184
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,640
The fact that you invited me here today

185
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,360
means you've figured it out.

186
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,600
I welcome you on behalf

187
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:02,919
of Light Kingdom.

188
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:04,960
Mr. Ao.

189
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,840
Before I got here,

190
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,990
I called Mr. De and Mr. Sai
who are on your board of directors.

191
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,480
They asked me to give you a message.

192
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,600
I was blind.

193
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:32,960
I didn't realize
you knew those two big shots.

194
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,879
What are their instructions?

195
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,000
Tell me.

196
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,919
They asked me to tell you

197
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:42,480
that there are bad people
in Light Kingdom

198
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,639
who want to banish you from M78 Nebula.

199
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,679
Why?

200
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:51,879
Everything I do is for Ao Te Empire.

201
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:53,399
Why did they want to do that?

202
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:54,679
Look at this.

203
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,519
What's this?

204
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,840
This

205
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,919
is proof
that Li Ji embezzled company funds.

206
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,799
Mr... Mr. Ao.

207
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:10,879
I'll hit you!

208
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,399
You've done something bad.

209
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,840
I will destroy you
on behalf of Light Kingdom!

210
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,519
How dare you hit me?

211
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:19,279
Ao Te Empire?

212
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,600
M78 Nebula?

213
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,960
Who are you?

214
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,360
Jiangjing Mental Hospital patient card?

215
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:33,799
Ao Daman?

Yes.

223
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:50,600
It's time
for you to serve Light Kingdom.

224
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:59,039
Evil monster.

225
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:01,559
I will destroy you.

Li Ji.

227
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,360
Thank you for getting a mental patient

228
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,639
to sign a contract with me.

229
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,279
This contract is now void.

230
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,600
Take care of yourself.

231
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,039
Liu Wen, don't go.

232
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,440
Don't go.

233
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,120
Help.

234
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,840
Hello? Luo Nan.

235
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,060
Thank you for your information.

236
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,519
About Mr. Ao...

237
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,480
Wait for me.

238
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:30,080
Ningmeng.

239
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:02,600
We have a problem!

240
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:04,480
We have a big problem!

241
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:05,919
Uncle.

242
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:07,480
What happened?

243
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,039
Live stream.

244
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:11,480
Your live stream account
for selling Tongnan specialties.

245
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,879
What's wrong with my account?

246
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:14,720
It has become popular.

247
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,799
Each video has over a million views.

248
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,200
Really?

249
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,840
Even the official cultural and tourism
department liked it.

250
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,320
Let me see.

251
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,399
Our homestay too.

252
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:28,519
Our homestay's account
has been recommended.

253
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:31,279
Now videos of you planting vegetables
and me selling goods

254
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,759
are all over the internet.

255
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,559
That's great, Uncle.

256
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:36,440
Do you know how many messages
we received in the backend?

257
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,000
Over ten thousand.

258
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:40,720
They're all asking
for our homestay's reservation.

259
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,559
Besides that,

260
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:43,159
The leader of Ancient Town called me.

261
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:44,990
He told us
to hurry up and open for business.

262
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,120
That's great.

263
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,840
They will provide
all the necessary support.

264
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:50,440
We finally did it, Uncle.

265
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,600
We finally did it.

266
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,120
I'm going to call Caramel

267
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,159
and tell him.

268
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,799
Where did you go?

269
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:11,399
I'm right beside you.

270
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,399
I missed you!

271
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,799
I missed you too!

272
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:28,559
Our account went viral.

273
