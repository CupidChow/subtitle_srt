(Ningmeng Homestay)

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,560
Welcome to Tongnan's Ancient Town.

9
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,120
Welcome.

10
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:12,200
Wow.

11
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,159
Go in, please.

12
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,760
The owner is so pretty.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,239
May I ask
who our influencer, Caramel, is?

14
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:18,719
Caramel?

15
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:19,640
I... I am.

16
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,079
Ah, we finally met you.

17
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:22,439
Can I take a photo with you?

18
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,159
Come on.

19
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,319
Sure.

20
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,640
I want to take a photo too.

21
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:28,830
I want to take a photo together too.

22
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,560
I want to take a photo too.

23
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,680
Take a photo with me first.

24
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,640
Here, let me help you.

25
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,000
Thank you.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,920
Look here.

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,280
Caramel.

28
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,680
Give a bigger smile.

29
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,400
Alright.

30
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,519
Okay. Thank you.

31
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,560
Welcome.

32
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,200
Go in, please.

33
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:54,519
Go in, please.

34
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,760
There's a complimentary Taian fish
for every table today.

35
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:09,919
What

36
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,520
would you say is currently
the most pressing thing for us?

37
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,879
Expanding more rooms.

38
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,360
I'm talking

39
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:31,439
about the most pressing thing for us.

40
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,439
You're annoying.

41
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,080
Is something wrong?

42
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,879
We have a group of guests today,

43
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,759
but we lack a room.

44
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,199
We really can't free up any more.

45
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,759
I have a solution.

46
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:28,719
Huh?

47
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:29,639
What solution?

48
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,439
They can stay in my room first.

49
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,599
I'll stay outside.

50
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,599
There's really no other way.

51
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,840
It's the only thing we can do.

52
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,599
I'll clean it up first.

53
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,560
You...

54
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,560
Does it hurt?

55
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,360
No.

56
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,479
Really?

57
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,879
I

58
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,759
didn't do it on purpose.

59
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:23,480
The office is indeed
unsuitable for romantic gestures,

60
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:24,879
but

61
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,920
I can't take it anymore.

62
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,560
Uncle.

63
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:38,120
Why didn't you knock before coming in?

64
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,839
There's not enough ingredients
for the vegetable feast.

65
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:46,240
Should I buy some more?

66
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:47,920
It's a small matter.

67
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,600
You can decide yourself.

68
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,800
Yeah.

69
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,879
I'll go buy some more.

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,560
You're absolutely safe.

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,800
No one will bother us now.

72
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm Zhao Zilong of Changshan.

73
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,199
I will charge in and out seven times.

74
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,000
Ningmeng.

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,680
I've done what you told me.

76
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,120
Sorry.

77
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,240
Hey.

78
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,240
Close it.

79
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,800
Mr. Li.

80
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,759
I found out what you asked me to find.

81
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:54,439
Ling Feng was once
an employee of our company.

82
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:57,279
I also took a photo of him meeting Lian.

83
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,519
Liu Lian is in Tongnan?

84
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,560
Why didn't you say so earlier?

85
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,680
I did you a great favor.

86
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,399
What about the reward you promised?

87
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:15,879
Yueyue.

88
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,519
Did you deliberately

89
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,199
let Tian Ningmeng
into the company that day?

90
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,439
I didn't.

91
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:33,720
I know what you're thinking.

92
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,760
When the snipe and the clam struggle,

93
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,199
the fisherman reaps the benefits.

94
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,040
Give it back!

95
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,279
You're shameless!

96
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,120
Lianlian?

97
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,560
I just found out you came to Tongnan.

98
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,279
I'm about to go find you.

99
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,920
I came here to tell you

100
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,720
I'm pregnant.

101
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,759
You're pregnant?

102
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,600
Oh, Lianlian.

103
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,040
You're awesome.

104
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,920
I... I'm going to be a father.

105
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:49,000
I... I'm going to be a father.

106
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,720
I want to give birth to the baby.

107
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,000
Lianlian.

108
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,000
Look.

109
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:57,120
I'm about to take over a company.

110
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,079
For the sake of your future,

111
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,000
I think

112
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,959
it's not the best time to have a child.

113
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,199
How about this?

114
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,319
Let's abort this baby first.

115
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,480
Abort?

116
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,160
This is your baby.

117
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:14,120
Our baby.

118
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,319
Okay.

119
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,120
We'll give birth to this baby.

120
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,279
Lianlian.

121
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:24,240
Go back

122
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,690
to the hotel and have a good rest first.

123
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,680
I'll prepare a grand proposal ceremony

124
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,040
for you.

125
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
When did you bring the car back?

126
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,559
When did you sell the car?

127
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,080
From now on,

128
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,600
don't hide anything from me.

129
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,720
You hear me?

130
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:11,159
Okay.

131
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,879
I'll do whatever you say

132
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,200
from now on.

133
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,600
That's more like it.

134
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,080
We can now have some privacy.

135
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,039
Ah!

136
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:37,399
Ah!

137
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,360
It's so embarrassing.

138
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:50,759
They were doing something last night.

139
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,519
Youngsters nowadays are full of tricks.

140
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,919
How humiliating.

141
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,600
It's those two.

142
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,039
What happened?

143
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,200
They did something.

144
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:09,320
I'm too embarrassed to say it.

145
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,759
Unbelievable.

146
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,320
It's embarrassing.

147
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:17,320
Liu.

148
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,360
These young people
are enjoying a little romance.

149
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,120
No need to overreact.

150
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,420
Do you know what they were doing?

151
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:25,000
They were doing the deed.

152
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,080
What's wrong with that?

153
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,480
Our homestay business is booming.

154
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,320
It's booming.

155
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,159
There are many customers waiting for us.

156
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,260
We'll leave first.

157
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:36,919
Hey.

158
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,120
Your business is booming,

159
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,500
so you came to my place to destress?

160
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:41,440
We'll stop doing this business.

161
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,650
Let's turn it into a brothel.

162
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,000
Mr. Liu.

163
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,159
Our homestay is looking for investment.

164
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:46,919
Why don't you

165
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,879
join us?

166
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:51,000
Oh.

167
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,279
You should have told me so.

168
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:54,159
I will fully cooperate with you.

169
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,440
As long as we can sign
the contract today,

170
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,279
I'll make Taian fish
for you immediately.

171
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,679
What are you looking at? Disperse.

172
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:35,279
Be careful.

173
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,519
Be safe.

174
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:56,200
May I ask

175
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,440
if this is Hejie Street?

176
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,600
This is Hejie Street.

177
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,519
It's not over there?

178
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:00,919
This is Hejie Street.

179
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:01,720
May I ask

180
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,559
where number 23 is?

181
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,240
Over there.

182
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,679
Ah, so this is number 23.

183
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:08,039
Thank you.

184
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:08,840
Goodbye.

185
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,639
Okay. Thank you.

186
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,879
Come on, birthday girl.

187
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,720
Make a wish.

188
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,840
Where did you get the money

189
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,279
to invest in the company?

190
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,919
Mortgage loan.

191
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,559
Really?

192
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:54,720
Yeah.
