=Episode 5=

7
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,399
Ah.

8
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,640
I did say that.

9
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:48,759
Didn't our ancient town
just get rated as a 4A scenic spot?

10
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,560
Clear waters and lush mountains
are as valuable as gold and silver.

11
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,220
(Clear Waters and Lush Mountains
Are As Valuable As Gold and Silver)

12
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:57,119
Isn't it gold?

13
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:00,359
Aren't you tricking Ningmeng
into coming back?

14
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,880
How is it tricking?

15
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:04,560
Ningmeng has given up
the homestay she had everyone

16
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:06,239
to lease.

17
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:07,879
This old house
is about to be demolished.

18
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:09,159
She won't answer our phone calls.

19
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,170
What do you want me to do?

20
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,200
You...

21
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,640
Hey, let me tell you.

22
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,159
Oh.

23
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:13,840
Enough.

24
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,879
Sit down and talk.

25
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:24,280
The people in this scenic spot
have informed me.

26
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,599
They said

27
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,159
it will have to be demolished

28
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:29,200
if this homestay can't be opened

29
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,840
this month.

30
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:32,359
Oh.

31
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:35,799
The villagers
hope to keep the old house.

32
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:37,359
Yang.

33
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,120
Ningmeng is top student from our place
who got to Beijing.

34
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:42,719
I believe

35
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:45,280
she came back
to help us develop our tourism.

36
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,599
I'm sure she wouldn't lie.

37
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,760
Besides, she would prefer
to keep the old house.

38
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:52,920
Right?

39
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,920
Ningmeng.

40
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,000
Our old house is counting on you.

41
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:02,280
Uncle.

42
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,400
Mr. Liu.

43
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,599
Madam Yang.

44
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,290
I'll drink first to show my respect.

45
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,919
Here's to everyone.

46
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,639
Go easy on the drinks.

47
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,280
Tell me

48
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,810
why you tricked Ningmeng to come back.

49
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,319
Chen.

50
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,950
Enough is enough.
We're all part of the brotherhood.

51
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,360
Don't be indecisive.

52
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,200
You're treating us to dinner,

53
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,199
but the whole table
is full of vegetarian dishes.

54
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,680
There's not even any meat.

55
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:34,080
How stingy.

56
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,280
Do you want me
to cook you some scrambled eggs?

57
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,479
Are eggs a meat dish?

58
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,960
I want to eat their mother.

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,460
Their mother needs to lay eggs.

60
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,800
I don't mind having their father.

61
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,520
You want their mother to become a widow?

62
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,280
Here, Mr. Liu.

63
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:46,919
Uncle.

64
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:49,280
Let's drink.

65
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,800
Don't drink so much.

66
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,240
Why did I hear

67
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,000
the mute ask you not to drink so much?

68
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,479
No, Mr. Liu.

69
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:03,199
You must be drunk and misheard.

70
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,680
How can a mute speak?

71
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,639
I'm drunk?

72
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,039
Do you think I'm like your uncle?

73
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,520
Your uncle

74
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,719
drank two shots and threw up
in the women's restroom last time.

75
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:14,759
Liu.

76
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,479
You're getting
more and more out of line.

77
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,360
You're just jealous

78
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,520
that I beat you
at the mahjong tournament last night.

79
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,840
Oh, you're making a scene.

80
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,199
Aren't you ashamed?

81
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,680
Oh, shut up.

82
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,120
Shut up.

83
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,520
Yang.

84
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:30,960
Do you know

85
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,360
that Chen watched you shower
from their second floor?

86
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,840
You jerk!

87
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,120
I'm going to beat you.

88
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,560
Come on.

89
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:39,420
You're asking for a beating?

90
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,640
Come on.

91
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,960
Come on.

92
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,360
Don't fight.

93
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,520
Stop fighting.

94
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,000
Jeez.

95
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,319
Shut up.

96
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:54,960
Oh.

97
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:56,759
You fight when you meet.

98
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:57,700
You argue when you meet.

99
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:00,159
You two just argue and fight
when you sit together.

100
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,520
Is that appropriate?

101
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,719
Here.

102
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,159
What are you doing?

103
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,159
What are you doing?

104
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,360
What do you want to do?

105
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,400
What are you trying to do?

106
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:13,759
What do you want to do?

107
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:14,879
Alright!

108
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,120
Stop messing around!

109
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,590
No one leaves
until the blood stops flowing!

110
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,600
You can only leave
once the blood has completely dried up.

111
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,920
- Come on.
- Come on.

112
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:24,879
Let's go.

113
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,360
Let's go.

114
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,040
Come on!

115
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,720
The two of you...

116
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:31,160
You two don't need to fight to the end!

117
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:58,680
Here.

118
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,360
Let me tell you.

119
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,120
This cruise restaurant tonight
has such a special vibe.

120
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,839
You'll like it very much.

121
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,160
Well... Tingting.

122
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,000
How about this?

123
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,439
Wait for me on the boat.

124
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,839
Be good.

125
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,140
I'll be there in a moment.

126
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,560
Hello?

127
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,319
Where are you?

128
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,600
I miss you.

129
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:33,800
I'm on a business trip in Guangzhou.

130
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,560
Oh, you don't know.

131
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:36,959
I missed you

132
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,040
all day today.

133
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,279
Really?

134
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,610
Is the business negotiation going well?

135
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,220
I just started
getting to know the client.

136
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,710
We're still in building mutual trust.

137
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,439
It will take some time.

138
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,160
Oh, you don't know.

139
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,879
I've been busy all day today.

140
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:54,930
I accompanied the client the entire day
and haven't eaten anything yet.

141
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,439
Don't work too hard.

142
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,260
It would break my heart
if you exhaust yourself.

143
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:02,319
Hey.

144
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,680
Which hotel are you staying at?

145
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,160
I'll order supper for you.

146
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:07,680
No need.

147
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,839
I'll gain weight from eating supper.

148
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:12,560
I have to save my best figure for you.

149
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,120
Here's the thing, Lianlian.

150
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:17,120
My client is still waiting for me.

151
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,120
How about this?

152
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,879
I'll call you as soon as I'm done.

153
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,720
Okay?

154
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,319
Okay.

155
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,800
I miss you.

156
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,319
I miss you too.

157
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,120
Do you think I'm pretty?

158
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,480
Yes.

159
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,639
You're lying.

160
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,360
I'm not lying.

161
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,439
You're really pretty.

162
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,160
If I'm pretty,

163
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,240
why would my boyfriend cheat on me?

164
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,759
And

165
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,920
he cheated on me with my best friend.

166
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,040
It's not your problem.

167
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,839
It's your boyfriend's problem.

168
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,680
I'm just a fool,

169
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:12,480
a liar,

170
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,240
and someone who wouldn't pay her debts.

171
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,319
I deserved it.

172
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,040
How do you deserve it?

173
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,120
I was so stupid.

174
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,960
I allowed my boyfriend

175
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,519
embezzle the funds.

176
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,960
You know that.

177
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:54,279
I know.

178
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:56,240
But

179
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,000
you have a family that loves you.

180
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:01,799
You also have me.

181
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:12,279
Who?

182
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,159
Who?

183
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,799
Me.

184
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:16,720
You?

185
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,559
Who are you?

186
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,840
Aren't you just after me

187
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,440
because I'm pretty?

188
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,240
You're really drunk.

189
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,159
Look.

190
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:49,639
Mountains of gold and silver.

191
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:01,120
I really thought I...

192
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:04,919
I had one last shred of hope.

193
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:07,039
Do you know

194
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,399
that I'm a liar too?

195
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:36,960
What did you lie to me about?

196
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,120
I've wanted to tell you for a long time.

197
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,840
Actually,

198
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,759
our meeting was no accident.

199
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,399
I had an agenda.

200
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,919
I wanted

201
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,200
to come...

202
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,919
I wanted to come and help you.

203
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,360
I have never eaten

204
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,799
at such a high-end cruise restaurant.

205
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:00,240
Help yourself.

206
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:01,879
It's my treat.

207
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,120
Handsome.

208
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:05,679
Aren't you here
to find your ex-girlfriend?

209
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,320
Why do you have time to buy me dinner?

210
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,159
Stop mentioning it.

211
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,039
She already ran off with someone.

212
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,960
Alright. Let's stop talking about her.

213
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,960
It's fate

214
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:18,759
that we met.

215
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,000
Actually,

216
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,320
I quite like your personality.

217
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,039
She left a handsome guy

218
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,080
and be with an ugly one.

219
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,790
I don't know
what's on your girlfriend's mind.

220
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,440
As the saying goes,

221
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,530
women are difficult.

222
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,480
I don't get it either.

223
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,559
Your girlfriend is really blind.

224
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:42,279
Here.

225
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,720
Thank you for comforting me.

226
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,080
Cheers.

227
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:49,639
Cheers.

228
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,120
Miss, can I get you anything?

229
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,559
I want to order this

230
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:00,519
for that table.

231
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,799
Are you sure you want us
to serve to that table

232
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:04,080
and pay for it?

233
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,000
Give me your hand.

234
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,679
Hand?

235
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:13,639
Let me see.

236
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:14,879
Are you going to read my palm?

237
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:16,200
Of course.

238
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:17,120
Oh.

239
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,840
You have an amazing love life.

240
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,600
Is that so?

241
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:22,679
Look.

242
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:23,879
Your love line

243
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:25,399
is deep and long.

244
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:27,840
It means your love life is going well.

245
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,440
And you're particularly happy.

246
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,759
All I've met are scumbags, okay?

247
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,080
How is that possible?

248
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:33,480
Look.

249
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,480
Judging by your palm,

250
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,600
you'll meet a bachelor,

251
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:40,519
who's handsome and rich.

252
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:42,440
Most importantly, he treats you well.

253
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,159
You're lying?

254
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:44,159
Why would I lie to you?

255
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,720
Look at yourself.

256
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,720
You're tricking me.

257
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,200
I'll tell you your fortune.

258
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,360
You should be able to meet this person

259
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,360
starting today.

260
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:55,039
What a coincidence?

261
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,879
I happen to meet you today.

262
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,440
Uh, you can say that.

263
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,480
You'll have to take responsibility.

264
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:03,720
Sure.

265
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:06,240
A man of honor keeps his word.

266
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:36,519
How do you know about this?

267
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,519
Someone ordered this for you.

268
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,840
We didn't order this, did we?

269
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,720
Don't we already have a plate?

270
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,480
Ah, it's that...

271
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,279
That lady ordered this for you.

272
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,519
