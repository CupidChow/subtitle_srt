=Episode 11=

7
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,000
You came back so soon.

8
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:52,479
Why pretend?

9
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:54,260
No wonder
you ex-girlfriend doesn't want you.

10
00:00:58,719 --> 00:00:59,840
Coming.

11
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,400
Who are you? Did you get the wrong person?

12
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,640
You're the one I'm after.

13
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,439
Move out of my way.

14
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,200
Move!

15
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,680
I'm calling the police.

16
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:12,560
How dare you steal my man?

17
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,400
Help!

18
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,319
Someone!

19
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,719
Help! Murder!

20
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:23,000
Help!

21
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:27,879
Ningmeng.

22
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:30,040
Ningmeng.

23
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,680
Why are you so annoying?

24
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,680
You're everywhere.

25
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,480
Ningmeng.

26
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,319
Don't touch me.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,640
Ningmeng.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,319
I saw your live stream.

29
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,040
I even gave you gifts.

30
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,430
How did you know I was live streaming?

31
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,000
You're so popular.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,879
Tongnan's number one.
Anyone can see you.

33
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,780
Looks like you've watched a lot
of live streams in your spare time.

34
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,439
I never gave gifts
to other female streamers.

35
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,400
Except you.

36
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,439
I came to tell you

37
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,439
that I think your live stream

38
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:01,879
is still too conservative.

39
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,079
You can't let loose.

40
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:09,840
Tell me

41
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,800
how to let loose.

42
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,159
Black stockings.

43
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,280
Miniskirt.

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,319
Set skin smoothing and face slimming
to the maximum.

45
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,360
Be provocative and play dumb.

46
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,439
Look at the men and think of something.

47
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,560
Show your chest and your figure.

48
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,000
They'll impulsively send you gifts.

49
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,919
Li Ji.

50
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,039
How come I didn't realize

51
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,280
you were so gross?

52
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:38,439
Ningmeng.

53
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:40,439
That's is the strategy I summarized
for female streamers.

54
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:42,000
I don't tell others easily.

55
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,479
What you have is rubbish.

56
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,520
Ningmeng.

57
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,840
Make way.

58
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,680
Make way!

59
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:00,719
I think

60
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,719
you did it on purpose.

61
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,439
It's my first time driving this.

62
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,599
I don't know how to brake.

63
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:10,960
Li Ji.

64
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,919
I found a place that suits you better.

65
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,560
White Horse Club.

66
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:17,520
No.

67
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,719
I...

68
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,319
Ningmeng.

69
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,719
I'm sacrificing myself for your career.

70
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,520
Darling.

71
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,199
Let's go home

72
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:28,199
and do what we love.

73
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:29,840
Sure.

74
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,479
Bye.

75
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,240
Hey.

76
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,680
Your Highness, please.

77
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,039
I don't feel like eating.

78
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:53,919
I have a surprise for you.

79
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,199
Go and take a look.

80
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,719
What surprise?

81
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,680
They're all shock.

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,120
Don't be so discouraged.

83
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,640
You'll find out after taking a look.

84
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,879
Taian fish?

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,800
Yes.

86
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,760
I made this
using the traditional cooking method.

87
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:16,839
Here.

88
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,839
It's a bit cold.

89
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,720
Cover yourself with a blanket.

90
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,439
Let me try your cooking.

91
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,279
Try it.

92
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,360
It's yummy.

93
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,120
It tastes like my grandpa's cooking.

94
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,920
It tastes exactly the same.

95
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,560
I learned to make it for you.

96
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,439
How did you

97
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,360
find me this afternoon?

98
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:11,360
You registered with your phone number.

99
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,959
I got a prompt
once you started streaming.

100
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,759
I'm a streamer too.

101
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:20,600
So you saw everything.

102
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,439
Yeah.

103
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:25,879
I think a live stream
that makes you give up your dignity

104
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,000
won't last long.

105
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:32,560
I don't want to give up
my dignity either,

106
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,480
but what else can I do?

107
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,240
How about this?

108
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,839
We can shoot

109
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,920
some travel-related
videos or live streams

110
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,120
of Tongnan.

111
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,560
It's more meaningful that way.

112
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:47,560
Yeah.

113
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,199
My live stream is meaningless.

114
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,120
But do you know why I did all this?

115
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,879
Do I have time to do meaningful things?

116
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,360
How many followers do you have?

117
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:11,839
6,600.

118
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:13,680
Do you know

119
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,519
I have over ten thousand followers

120
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,399
after my live stream today.

121
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,240
This is fame.

122
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,800
This is money.

123
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,160
There's no need
for you to sell your looks

124
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:31,279
and humiliate yourself to gain fame,
right?

125
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:34,199
Do you think you're happy

126
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,800
doing this?

127
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,759
I don't need to be happy.

128
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:42,439
Is happiness important to me?

129
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:46,000
All I need now is money.

130
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,000
All I need is money.

131
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,079
If it's about money,

132
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:58,439
I've already raised

133
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,120
the start-up fund for the homestay.

134
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,820
Who asked you
to raise all this money for me?

135
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:11,480
Who asked you
to raise all this money for me?

136
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,600
You don't think I can do it either,
do you?

137
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,800
I didn't think that way.

138
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,600
There are many ways to make money.

139
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,800
You don't have to strip.

140
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,639
What did you say?

141
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:30,680
What are you talking about?

142
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,399
What are you talking about?

143
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,079
I did all this

144
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,639
just to make you better.

145
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,879
I don't want to see you like this.

146
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:46,720
I can be better

147
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,319
without you.

148
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,360
Pack up your things tomorrow.

149
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:54,600
Scram!

150
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:38,559
Are you eating or not?

151
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,770
I'm throwing it out if you're not.

152
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,100
(Police)

153
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:40,600
Ms. Liu.

154
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:41,679
She's

155
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,279
willing to compromise.

156
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,639
I paid her.

00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:01,720
Why don't we

160
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,720
go back to Beijing?

161
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:06,279
Stop at Happiness Street's

162
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,840
Flower Alley.

163
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:09,480
I want to be alone.

164
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,639

You sing very well.

174
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,360
Have a drink.

175
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,480
Miss, we're closed.

176
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,440
Are you kicking me out?

177
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:10,559
Sure.

178
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,440
I'll leave.

179
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,279
I'll leave.

Are you okay?

182
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,919
I'm fine.

183
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:26,000
Miss!

184
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,559
Miss, are you okay?

185
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,639
Why don't I send you home?

186
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:05,320
Be careful.

187
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:06,679
Be careful.

188
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:07,600
Don't pull me.

189
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,159
I can still drink.

190
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,159
Let me help you.

191
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,159
Go on.

192
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:13,279
It's so hot.

Are you okay?

00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,000
Li Ji.

197
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,720
Are you leaving me again

198
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:45,159
for another woman?

199
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,240
Miss.

200
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,399
You got the wrong person.

201
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:56,120
Don't leave me.

Li Ji.

203
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,200
As long as you don't leave me,

204
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,279
I can accept whatever you do.

205
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,120
I can't live without you.

206
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,200
I really can't live without you

207
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:14,000
Don't you just like women?

208
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:16,799
Miss.

209
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,120

211
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:22,519
Miss.

212
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,759
This is inappropriate.
