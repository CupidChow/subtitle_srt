=Episode 2=

7
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,980
(One Week Ago, Beijing)

8
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,759
Li Ji's car.

9
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,719
Why is Li Ji's car here?

10
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:55,039
This is the new contract.

11
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,479
Okay, I'll check it out later.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,400
This is the necklace
I ordered for half a year.

13
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,159
It's called Misplaced Love.

14
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,200
It's for my Lianlian.

15
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,599
What's wrong, Babe?

16
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,480
Wouldn't it be a bad idea for us

17
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,640
to squeeze Ningmeng out of the company?

18
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,359
Look at what she has done
to the company.

19
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:24,730
Only the two of us can make the company
bigger and stronger.

20
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:25,519
Right?

21
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,120
Yeah.

22
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,599
Wang.

23
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,079
(April)
Ms. Liu isn't available today.

24
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,810
How do you know she's not available?

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,990
Her boyfriend who drives a Panamera
is here again.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,680
She said
she won't see any visitors today.

27
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,260
Panamera?

28
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,550
The plate number ending with 357?

29
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,920
That's my boyfriend.

30
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,799
Are we always
going to stay hidden like this?

31
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,480
I'll make sure they know you're mine.

32
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,280
There are many people in the company.

33
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,520
Li Ji, don't.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,120
Your boyfriend?

35
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,759
Ah.

36
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,680
They've shown up
by hugging each other lately.

37
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,240
Hugging each other?

38
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:55,960
Ningmeng, let me explain.

39
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,719
It's not what you think.

40
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,879
I'm here to help you
get some investment.

41
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,479
Didn't you say you'd help me get a loan?

42
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,439
Is it a mortgage loan?

43
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,039
Aren't I here?

44
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,759
Is this how you get investments?

45
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,719
What were you doing?

46
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,240
What were you doing just now?

47
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,000
Tian Ningmeng, stop.

48
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,120
How long have you two been together?

49
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:24,800
Li Ji and I

50
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,560
have been together for a long time.

51
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,759
He just doesn't want to see you

52
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,319
and tell you.

53
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,319
He's afraid that you'll be upset.

54
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,199
Liu Lian.

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We've been best friends for years.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,479
How could you do this to me?

57
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,439
Yeah.

58
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,800
We were best friends for years.

59
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,479
We were best friends for years.

60
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:49,759
I treated you well, didn't I?

61
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,560
Your travel company would have closed
down long ago without me.

62
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,960
I gave you everything you have now.

63
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,240
I gave you!

64
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,159
Ningmeng.

65
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,639
Liu Lian is right.

66
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,360
Without their investment,

67
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:08,159
our travel agency
would have been doomed.

68
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,780
Go back and show
the people in your company

69
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,800
what their Ms. Liu

70
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,199
is doing behind the scenes
in the office!

71
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,399
What are you doing?

72
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,279
Go away!

73
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,639
Ah!

74
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,279
Li Ji.

75
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,040
It's over between us.

76
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,519
Ningmeng.

77
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,519
You're awake.

78
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,480
I saw you were sleeping soundly,

79
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,519
so I didn't wake you up.

80
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,000
Hey.

81
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:26,360
Be careful!

82
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,800
I can't control my car.

83
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,480
Where are you going?

84
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,240
How could you drive like that?

85
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,240
Don't be impulsive!

86
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,879
I'm talking to you!

87
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,120
What driving is that?

88
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,720
Open the door. I'm talking to you!

89
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,439
What driving is that?

90
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,000
Ah!

91
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,879
Help!

92
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,199
Hey.

93
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,279
Stop!

94
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,199
Let me out of the car!

95
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,560
What are you doing?

96
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,040
Stop!

97
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,000
Speed up!

98
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,560
Stop.

99
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,360
We've ran out of electricity,
so there's a speed limit.

100
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,600
This car is as lame as you are.

101
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,490
I won't go easy on you.

102
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,290
He's about to catch up with us.

103
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,810
We have no choice.
There's a speed limit.

104
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:27,120
Let me out of the car!

105
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,600
Stop the car.

106
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,279
Let the girl go!

107
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,600
Stop.

108
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,560
Bro.

109
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:42,800
Stop chasing us.

110
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,199
We're collecting debt legally.

111
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,839
We won't hurt Ms. Tian.

112
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,120
I'll stop chasing you
if you stop the car.

113
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:51,519
You're going to exhaust yourself
running like that.

114
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,639
It's because of all of you.

115
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:56,000
Be good.

116
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,439
Caramel.

117
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,560
How are you?

118
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,439
I can't take it anymore.

119
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,120
Let me go!

120
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,319
Hands off!

121
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:12,839
Let her go.

122
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,040
I was wondering
what your relationship is.

123
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,399
You two are true love!

124
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,040
Yes.

125
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:19,519
We have a relationship
that's more than true love.

126
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,000
I told you
I was collecting debt legally.

127
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,199
Whatever your relationship is,

128
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:26,240
she has to come with me today!

129
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,920
I'm her boyfriend.

130
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,680
How much does she owe you?

131
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,560
I'll pay for her.

132
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:33,040
Don't talk nonsense!

133
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,199
He was just passing by!

134
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,879
Bro.

135
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,360
Do you think you're a wealthy boss
trying to save the damsel in distress?

136
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,040
I'm telling you.

137
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,759
You don't have enough money
to pay the money she owes.

138
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,360
How much does she owe then?

139
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,839
Four million yuan!

140
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,319
Four million yuan? How is that possible?

141
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,519
So much money was misappropriated.

142
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,319
Ms. Liu withdrew her investment.

143
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,990
Four million yuan
is considered a small amount.

144
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,480
Pay your debt.

145
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,930
You're not allowed to leave Beijing.

146
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,959
Otherwise, you will be in trouble.

147
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,759
You owe four million yuan?

148
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,639
Tian Ningmeng

149
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,759
is a notorious debtor!

150
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:24,519
Enough, stop talking.

151
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,360
How much is the interest?

152
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,079
180 thousand yuan!

153
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,759
I'll pay you

154
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,600
156 thousand yuan.

155
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,200
You still owe 24 thousand yuan.

156
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,559
A gold mine
was discovered in my old house.

157
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,080
Trust me.

158
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,399
Give me a month.

159
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:44,159
I'll pay you.

160
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:45,480
What did you say?

161
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,840
A gold mine?

162
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,639
Are you trying to fool me?

163
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,320
Do you want the money or not?

164
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:54,720
WeChat Pay or Alipay?

165
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,919
Where are you going?

166
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,600
Give me your account number.

167
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,399
I'll pay you
as soon as I have money next month.

168
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,380
Where are you going?

169
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,679
I'm in Mercury retrograde recently.

170
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:26,520
Anyone who gets close to me
will be in trouble.

171
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,519
We're friends.

172
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,960
I'm not afraid of you implicating me.

173
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:34,120
Are you so heartless
to leave me here alone?

174
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,799
Roadside assistance

175
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,320
won't arrive until tomorrow.

176
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,200
Don't you blame me?

177
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,080
No.

178
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:52,480
I want to thank you.

179
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,360
Look.

180
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,279
You brought me to this beautiful view.

181
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:59,240
I'll pay you back
as soon as I get to Tongnan.

182
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,480
I became your creditor

183
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,759
without knowing it.

184
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,360
What's this?

185
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,559
Now is the season when rapeseed flowers
are at their prime.

186
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:12,200
I prepared rapeseed tempura
and rapeseed hot pot for you

187
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,159
to try.

188
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,480
Here.

189
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,039
It's yummy.

190
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,600
Do you have liquor?

191
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,480
Yes.

192
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,080
Many of the good things in life

193
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,240
can only be appreciated

194
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:39,279
when we pause and savor them.

195
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,080
Yeah.

196
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,480
The last few days

197
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,919
have been like a dream.

198
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,799
Is it a nightmare or a dream?

199
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:54,559
Both.

200
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:56,960
Once we reach Tongnan,

201
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,279
I hope it's a beautiful dream.

202
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:03,399
Do you want to watch a movie?

203
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,480
It goes well with wine.

204
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:08,360
How do you watch a movie here?

205
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,480
Roman Holiday

206
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:25,960
is my favorite movie.

207
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:28,279
Do you know

208
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,480
I like white dresses

209
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,519
because I like this movie?

210
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,039
I think you're as beautiful

211
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,120
as Hepburn.

212
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,679
I'm drunk.

213
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:18,919
Say.

214
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:24,440
Why do classic love stories

215
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:27,480
always end in regret?

216
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:30,559
Maybe regret

217
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:34,600
is the most beautiful form of love.
