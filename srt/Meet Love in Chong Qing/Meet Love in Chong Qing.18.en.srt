=Episode 18=

7
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:45,159
Will this work?

8
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,240
Don't fail.

9
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:48,479
Don't worry, Mr. Chen.

10
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:49,919
I have it under control.

11
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,199
When Ningmeng comes lates,

12
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,599
all you have to do is get her attention.

13
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,759
Ah, okay.

14
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,039
Oh.

15
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,599
Youngsters nowadays

16
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:57,719
are so carefree

17
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,879
and romantic.

18
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,840
They've only met for a while

19
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,080
and are already getting married so soon.

20
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,639
Madam Yang.

21
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,039
I've actually known Ningmeng
for a long time.

22
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:11,000
When Ningmeng is here,

23
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,719
I just have to twist this, right?

24
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,280
Yes, just twist this.

25
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,600
Thank you all for coming

26
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,210
and helping me surprise Ningmeng today.

27
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,959
It’s the right thing to do.

28
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,519
Look at our Ancient Town now.

29
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,680
It's so lively

30
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,680
and popular.

31
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,920
We should thank you
for helping Ningmeng

32
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,160
to be where we are today.

33
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:29,079
I wish you two

34
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:31,160
a happy every after

35
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,879
and have children soon.

36
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:33,680
Thank you, Madam Yang.

37
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,959
Here, hide.

38
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,720
Ningmeng will be back soon.

39
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,279
If Ningmeng is shy,

40
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:40,399
let's remember to cheer her on.

41
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,040
Good luck.

42
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,759
Where did Luo Nan go?

43
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:46,360
Yeah.

44
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,190
Luo Nan has been troubled
with worries recently.

45
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,319
I don't know either.

46
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,420
(People's Hospital of Tongnan, Chongqing
Report From Clinical Laboratory)

47
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,920
Why do you keep following me?

48
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,120
You're annoying.

49
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,600
I've always been by your side.

50
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,759
I know you're pregnant.

51
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,180
I will take responsibility.

52
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:09,040
Responsibility?

53
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,439
What responsibility?

54
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,930
I will take responsibility for the baby!

55
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,079
This baby has nothing to do with you.

56
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,850
It doesn't need you
to take responsibility for it either.

57
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:19,720
Don't go.

58
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,839
Whether the baby is mine,

59
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:21,959
I will take responsibility.

60
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,600
Stop following me. Scram!

61
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:35,639
Ningmeng.

62
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,279
Ningmeng.

63
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,639
Why are you alone?

64
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,680
Where's your bodyguard?

65
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,920
I have something to tell you.

66
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,079
Speak quickly.
I have important matters to deal with.

67
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,439
I know I'm bad.

68
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:48,199
I know I'm selfish.

69
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,160
I wronged you.

70
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,199
My feelings for you
have always been sincere.

71
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,120
Are you done?

72
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,040
I'm leaving.

73
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:59,920
That's why I have a piece of advice
for you before I go.

74
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,360
A piece of advice
about Caramel's secret.

75
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:11,120
Caramel's real name is Ling Feng.

76
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,959
He works for Liu Lian's father.

77
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,720
You didn't just meet him by chance.

78
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:17,040
Liu Lian arranged it.

79
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,120
She did this

80
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,120
so that Caramel could keep an eye on you

81
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,319
and make sure
you won't get back together with me.

82
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,199
Nonsense.

83
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:32,560
See for yourself.

84
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,759
Who are on these photos?

85
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,560
He found me in Tongnan

86
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,439
and bought my shares.

87
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:44,920
The two million yuan
invested into the company

88
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,160
also came from Liu Lian's company.

89
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:48,879
Ningmeng.

90
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,879
He owns your company now.

91
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:54,290
You're the one who got deceived by him,
both financially and emotionally.

92
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
I don't believe you.

93
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,759
Caramel isn't like that.

94
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,680
Ningmeng.

95
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,519
I'm just reminding you out of kindness.

96
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,879
It's up to you to believe me,

97
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,120
but

98
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:15,600
don't be fooled again.

99
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,720
It's dangerous.

100
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,399
Are you okay?

101
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,680
Did I scare you just now?

102
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,399
Caramel.

103
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,360
What's your real name?

104
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,639
Ling Feng.

105
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:30,800
Okay.

106
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,320
Look into my eyes.

107
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,840
Swear you never lied

108
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,200
to me.

109
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,200
I will never lie to you.

110
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,519
Do you know Liu Lian?

111
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,279
Yes.

112
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:52,200
Are you an employee of her company?

113
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,000
I was.

114
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,519
Was our meeting in Chongqing
a coincidence?

115
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,039
No.

116
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,039
What are you after?

117
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,480
Take care of you.

118
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,159
Take care of me?

119
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,480
Didn't Liu Lian arrange
for you to keep an eye on me?

120
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:09,919
No.

121
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:17,080
Did the money for the company
come from Liu Lian?

122
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:19,799
Yes

123
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,120
and no.

124
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,279
Yes or no?

125
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,639
It was urgent.

126
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:26,039
I borrowed from her.

127
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,600
I paid her back afterward.

128
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:31,000
Didn't you say it was a mortgage loan?

129
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,360
It's actually pretty much the same.

130
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,799
You know I hate it
when people lie to me.

131
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,000
Even if you know Liu Lian,

132
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:43,960
why didn't you tell me?

133
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:47,840
Why am I the last to know?

134
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,399
Our relationship

135
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,320
has nothing to do with Liu Lian.

136
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,440
You men are all the same.

137
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:04,039
Is there some kind of misunderstanding
between us?

138
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:41,860
(IOU)

139
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,380
(Tian Ningmeng)

140
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:11,639
Ningmeng.

141
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,440
Will you let me explain?

142
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,039
Mr. Ling Feng.

143
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,759
I was wrong to hit you.

144
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,080
What is this supposed to mean?

145
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:41,080
I didn't write down the amount.

146
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,399
You can put down
the amount you think is appropriate,

147
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,039
but I don't have any money right now.

148
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,200
When I have money,

149
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,200
I'll pay you immediately.

150
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,440
But why?

151
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,080
I'm tired.

152
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,000
Please let me go.

153
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:14,120
I really do love you.

154
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,799
Why?

155
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,039
Perhaps you love me,

156
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:26,080
but are you sure I love you?

157
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:29,200
You've been lying to me this whole time.

158
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:31,879
You owe me for lying to me.

159
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,279
We're considered even.

160
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,720
Ningmeng.

161
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,440
Have you ever loved me?

162
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,559
I never loved you.

163
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,360
I'm just grateful to you.

164
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,440
I never loved you.
