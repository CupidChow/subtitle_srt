=Episode 9=

7
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,879
Uncle?

8
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,319
What are you doing?

9
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,079
Aren't you staying downstairs?

10
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:34,000
Why are you up here?

11
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,959
It's a misunderstanding.

12
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,879
I let him come upstairs
last night, Uncle.

13
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,300
It's a misunderstanding.

14
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,439
Liu.

15
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:39,879
Let go.

16
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,920
Oh, let go.

17
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,280
Why are you so agitated?

18
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,040
What is the relationship
between you two?

19
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:44,719
We...

20
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:46,079
Friends.

21
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,640
We're good friends.

22
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,240
Do you need anything from me?

23
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,400
The operating period of the scenic spot
is about to expire.

24
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:56,560
You need to open your homestay soon.

25
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,519
Hurry up.

26
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,840
I'll work hard.

27
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,410
You're the whole village's hope.

28
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,439
The whole village's hope.

29
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,879
We crowdfunded a car

30
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,560
so that you can haul stuff.

31
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,990
We drove it over
and parked it at the entrance.

32
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,080
Uncle.

33
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,120
Thank everyone for me.

34
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:14,840
We'll leave first.

35
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,919
Let's go.

36
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:16,719
You can continue.

37
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,400
Continue.

38
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,000
Continue?

39
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,080
Continue what?

40
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,159
Have breakfast.

41
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,319
I brought you breakfast.

42
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,759
Have you eaten?

43
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:35,840
Ah, I have.

44
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:36,599
You can eat.

45
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,120
I made it for you.

46
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,080
Chen.

47
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,639
Help me ask Ningmeng

48
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,400
if she has any friends
who need a chauffeur.

49
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,800
I'm an experienced chauffeur.

50
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,200
Chauffeurs climb the ranks quickly.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,960
Jerk.

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,039
Don't tell others
about Ningmeng's affairs.

53
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,319
I'm known to be careful with my words.

54
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,400
How would I say anything carelessly?

55
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,000
You speak without thinking.

56
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,120
Promise me.

57
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,439
Why should I?

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,319
Unless you let me choose
my dance partner first this month.

59
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,599
Go ahead.

60
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,500
You still don't trust me
after I told you this?

61
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,360
How about the next month?

62
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,400
Oh.

63
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,759
How about the month after that?

64
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,439
Where's the car?

65
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,039
Is this your new car?

66
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,560
It's still quite down-to-earth.

67
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:39,879
This pose.

68
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:40,479
Hold on.

69
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,439
Hey.

70
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,520
Don't take a photo.

71
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,080
Hey, you don't say.

72
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,840
It matches your vibe quite well.

73
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,120
Ningmeng.

74
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,319
Could you go further?

75
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,759
Okay, I'll go further.

76
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,719
I have something to do.

77
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,919
Look around alone first.

78
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,350
You received 300 thousand yuan.

79
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,240
Check your phone.

80
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,360
Okay.

81
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,279
Got it.

82
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:50,600
Give me the keys.

83
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,439
What's all this?

84
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:01,240
It's so colorful.

85
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,839
I'm tearing it off.

86
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:02,550
Don't tear it off.

87
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,639
You can tear it

88
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,079
after you drive it away.

89
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,759
You're just causing me trouble.

90
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,639
Treat it well.

91
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,759
You're back so soon.

92
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,279
Did you miss me?

93
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,120
I missed your foot!

94
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,279
Oh, Ningmeng.

95
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:55,120
Just a few days.

96
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,360
Why have you become so rude?

97
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,680
Girls shouldn't behave like this.

98
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:59,639
How did you know I was here?

99
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,800
We invested in this project together.

100
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,199
Ningmeng.

101
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,680
Do you still remember
the time we fought together?

102
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:11,000
I only remember you fighting
to get into my best friend's bed.

103
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:12,439
Didn't I

104
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,199
already explain that to you?

105
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,990
I was just blinded by my impulses
for a moment.

106
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,199
And it was just one time.

107
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,720
You even caught us.

108
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,560
I really went to

109
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,319
help you borrow money from her.

110
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,000
Does Liu Lian know you were here?

111
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,360
Of course.

112
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:26,920
However,

113
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:29,120
I've cut ties with her.

114
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,120
I'll help you call her and ask.

115
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,040
No need.

116
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,160
No need.

117
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,079
Why should we

118
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,480
involve outsiders in our affairs?

119
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,720
How did I

120
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:42,680
fall for someone like you?

121
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:44,720
Ningmeng.

122
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:45,920
Seriously.

123
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,639
Do you really like

124
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,240
that guy named Caramel?

125
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,399
Yes.

126
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,879
I like him very much.

127
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,600
But do you know him?

128
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,759
Do you know his real background?

129
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,959
It's still better than yours.

130
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:58,680
Ningmeng.

131
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,000
Caramel isn't your type.

132
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,800
And I know you're deliberately
trying to piss me off.

133
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,290
Have you forgotten

134
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,240
that I risked my life to rescue you

135
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,360
from a group of hooligans?

136
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:10,720
Look

137
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,519
at your attitude toward me.

138
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,600
Ningmeng.

139
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,480
Wake up.

140
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,279
Ningmeng, wake up.

141
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:18,800
Keep on drinking.

142
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,680
Ningmeng.

143
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,920
Here.

144
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,279
Drink!

145
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,240
Ningmeng, wake up.

146
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,279
Miss, are you okay?

147
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,759
Drink!

148
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,160
Ningmeng.

149
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:53,920
Ningmeng.

150
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,560
Let me explain.

151
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,319
Hey!

152
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:57,600
What are you doing?

153
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,560
Hands off.

154
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,040
Let go.

155
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,800
What are you doing?

156
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,970
I'm calling the police.

157
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,199
Put down your phone.

158
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,360
Put down your phone!

159
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,160
No.

160
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,040
I won't go easy on you
if you don't leave.

161
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:06,639
Okay.

162
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,120
Let me see what you'll do to me.

163
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:14,040
Stop harassing Tian Ningmeng.

164
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:15,920
So what if I harassed her?

165
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,560
Hit me if you dare.

166
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,680
Why did you step on me?

167
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,639
You loser.

168
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,000
You asked for it.

169
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,799
Let's go.

170
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,120
It hurts, right?

171
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,679
Hey.

172
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:45,639
Ningmeng.

173
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,120
Ningmeng.

174
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,480
I'll give you time

175
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,159
to calm down.

176
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:32,320
Hello?

177
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,600
Lianlian.

178
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,350
Why does the supplementary card
you gave me stop working?

179
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,679
I don't see anything wrong here.

180
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,200
Is...

181
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:44,639
Is the card demagnetized?

182
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:46,480
Why don't you...

183
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,600
Why don't you come back to Beijing

184
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,799
and we can check it out?

185
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,919
I'm not done here.

186
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,480
I can't go back so soon.

187
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,480
Are you having too much fun

188
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:02,960
over there?

189
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:04,919
Or

190
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,720
is your business so successful

191
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,720
that you don't want to come back?

192
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,039
You make it sound like

193
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:11,519
I can't leave Guangzhou.

194
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,960
I'll book you a flight then.

195
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,559
Come back, okay?

196
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:16,919
No.

197
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:19,600
I can afford a flight ticket.

198
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,320

199
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,690
buying clients meals a lot lately,

200
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,720
and it's pretty expensive.

201
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,360
I...

202
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:30,080
I'll transfer you some money.

203
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,600
Sure.

204
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,900
(30000, Please Accept)

205
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,879
I got it.

206
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:50,080
You love me the most after all.

207
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:51,879
Alright.

208
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:52,480
Lianlian.

209
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,240
I'll stop talking.

210
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,120
I'll go back as soon as I'm done.

211
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,120
I'll hang up first.
