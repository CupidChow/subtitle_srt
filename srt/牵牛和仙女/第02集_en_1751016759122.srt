1
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,620
Is the restroom a water park?

2
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,580
Why would you play with water in there?

3
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,240
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,120
We weren't playing with water.

5
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,120
Oh, should I say you played with fire
since you were smoking?

6
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,710
Why you little…

7
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,090
Cleaning duty for a week.

8
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,170
-Sir!
-What?

9
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,550
Should I make that two weeks?

10
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,510
-Sir!
-I did that last week already.

11
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,590
Come on, just let it slide this once.

12
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,550
Don't write us up.

13
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,220
-Darn you, Seong-a…
-Park Seong-a…

14
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,700
Don't come close. Talk from there.

15
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,120
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

16
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,210
You sneaking into the men's room
or you spraying water all over me?

17
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,630
Which one are you on about?

18
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:07,840
Both.

19
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,590
There was something in there,
so I was trying to remove it.

20
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:11,590
What was in there?

21
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,300
A water gho…

22
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,560
A bug. A cockroach.

23
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,720
Yeah, there was a cockroach.

24
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,730
I hate bugs, so I had to kill it
when I saw one crawl in.

25
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,310
I was trying to get it…

26
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,820
And that happened.

27
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,490
Here's the thing.

28
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,110
I don't hate cockroaches that much.

29
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,740
At least they don't spray me with water
or get me in trouble.

30
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,290
In terms of danger,

31
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,250
you're far more harmful to me.

32
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,580
So keep your distance
and don't come close.

33
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,840
-But I--
-Don't come.

34
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,480
At least you survived.

35
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:08,900
My…

36
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,070
first…

37
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:10,980
love.

38
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,280
I can't believe we have to clean
because of Seong-a.

39
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,610
Your video too?

40
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,870
Are you trying to start a fire here?

41
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,630
-I'm not scared of you.
-Please be scared.

42
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,630
Shut up. I'm not scared of you.

43
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,880
How about now?

44
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,140
Jin-ung, I didn't see you there.

45
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,230
Hi.

46
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,980
You're saying hi to me now?

47
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,110
You know,
I wasn't talking to you just now.

48
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,900
Well…

49
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,200
I guess I was talking to you.

50
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:40,910
Hey.

51
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:42,910
You're acting up.

52
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,660
Know when to stop, okay?

53
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,960
I beat up women too.

54
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,460
Then I won't act up.

55
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,170
What does that mean anyway?
Acting like movie stars?

56
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,550
Do you know why I came here?

57
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:59,970
I came here to clean this yard
on behalf of all three of you.

58
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,760
Do you get me?

59
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,850
Tell me, Kim Jin-ung.
Do you get how kind I was trying to be?

60
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,310
-I didn't know.
-Exactly!

61
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,150
You don't know anything.

62
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,860
Go on. Get going. Shoo!

63
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,860
Can you… All by yourself?

64
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,320
-Good luck.
-Okay.

65
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,160
-Do a good job.
-Don't you worry.

66
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,070
Thanks.

67
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,580
-Sweet.
-Shall we hit the snack bar?

68
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,790
That freaked me out.
I thought he might hit me for real.

69
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,000
What should we eat?

70
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,710
I'm going to eat ramyeon with sausage.
Let's hurry.

71
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,290
Bok-i?

72
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,050
I helped you because you're so cute.

73
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,800
What a weird girl.

74
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,490
BAE GYEON-U! SAVE HIM! PROTECT HIM!

75
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,820
That little Water Ghost…

76
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,040
Oh, so warm. I feel so much better now.

77
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,760
He thinks roaches are better than me,
but I saved him.

78
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,340
Misfortune doesn't strike only once.

79
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,350
It'll come at him every single day
during those 21 days.

80
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,810
That's not all.

81
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:31,850
He walked in here upside down, which means
he's weaker than anything out there.

82
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,560
You only managed to save the boy
bound for the afterlife just once.

83
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,520
It's not some grand feat to fuss over.

84
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:37,860
That's amateur behavior!

85
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,610
Can't you just compliment me?

86
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,280
You little…

87
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,370
So what's your plan going forward?

88
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,700
I don't know.

89
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,830
I used up ten amulets all at once,
so I'm out.

90
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,800
That Water Ghost was really powerful.

91
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,970
Don't jump in without a plan recklessly.

92
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,010
Take your time to come up with a new one.

93
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,810
Did you make these yourself?

94
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,020
For me?

95
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,770
Why would I do that
for such an incorrigible spirit-daughter?

96
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,440
I got them from an expert.

97
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,280
You know him too.

98
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,320
This…

99
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,830
This is exactly why
I didn't want to make amulets for her.

100
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,000
Mother.

101
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,460
Wait a minute.

102
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,960
Oh, dear.

103
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,720
I love you, Mother.

104
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,840
You're too old to do this.

105
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,760
Still, I love you to the moon and back.

106
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,640
Thank you.

107
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,810
You think I did what you asked, huh?

108
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,480
Brace yourselves for what is to come.

109
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,390
I'm just done sweeping, that's all.

110
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,750
That won't do.

111
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,630
Watch me closely.

112
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,720
Oh, my goodness.

113
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,930
Are you okay?

114
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,100
Yeah, I'm good. Continue.

115
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,770
Shake it off. Good luck.

116
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:20,730
That's insane.

117
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,150
Hey. That was awesome.

118
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,570
Have a seat.

119
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,620
Hurry up and sit down.

120
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:39,660
Gyeon-u's grandmother came by
to give some snacks to his new friends.

121
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,250
Give her a big hand.

122
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,210
Enough.

123
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,260
Taste good, Beom?

124
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,130
Yes. Aren't you buying us any drinks, sir?

125
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,630
I have to go now. Yup, that's it.

126
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,930
Hey. This rice cake is really good.

127
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,390
Be sure to clean up before you go.

128
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,100
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

129
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,280
You scared me.

130
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:18,700
-What are you doing?
-I thought you were Gyeon-u.

131
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,250
Oh, no. I can't do this.

132
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,540
Jeez, you coward.

133
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,460
Give me the amulet and his phone.

134
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,260
-Thank you.
-Excuse me.

135
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,560
Isn't that my grandson Gyeon-u's phone?

136
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,600
I painted those yellow flowers myself.

137
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,570
Rice cakes have always been a bribe.

138
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,370
Something's fishy.

139
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,620
Fishy?

140
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,000
It reeks.

141
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,670
-Something's shady.
-Shady?

142
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,800
Something's suspicious?

143
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:14,590
Why don't we look up
the newbie's Stargram account?

144
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,930
Okay.

145
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,300
BAE GYEON-U

146
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,720
JU-MONG BAE GYEON-U
TEN! TEN! TEN!

147
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:21,430
JOONGHYUN HIGH'S ACE
WHO IS BAE GYEON-U?

148
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,850
"The next national team member"?

149
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,190
What's a guy like him doing here?

150
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,690
You were so kind enough to find his phone,

151
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,570
and now you're walking me home too.

152
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,700
We're going in the same direction anyway.

153
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,660
Are you okay?

154
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,660
Yes.

155
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,080
I'm fine.

156
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,710
Grandma!

157
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,420
I'm sorry. I lost my phone.

158
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:55,050
They found it for you.

159
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,100
Something looks different.

160
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,770
You messed with it, didn't you?

161
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,650
With your phone? Why would we?

162
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,650
Right. Why would we?

163
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,650
What do you take us for?

164
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,360
He may think you would.

165
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,530
Hey.

166
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,450
You've already made new friends.

167
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,410
No, they're not my friends.

168
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,250
I want to be your friend.

169
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,090
Ma'am, I'd like to be friends
with Gyeon-u.

170
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,090
Most people don't go near the unfortunate.

171
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,850
They may offer charity,
but they won't eat with them.

172
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:43,850
Let's eat together.

173
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,430
Let's eat together and become friends.

174
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,400
What? Newbie used to be an archer?

175
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,400
A gold medalist? Unbelievable.

176
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,070
He's from Joonghyun High.

177
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,360
He was a promising athlete
who won gold in every competition.

178
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:02,990
So why did someone like him
transfer to our school?

179
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,950
Our archery team is a cellar dweller.

180
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,210
-Maybe he was recruited.
-Right.

181
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,120
Do you really think so?

182
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,040
Ta-da.

183
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,090
THIS BASTARD IS AN ARSONIST

184
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,250
"This bastard is an arsonist."

185
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,840
"He was kicked out of the team
because he set the dorm on fire."

186
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,050
Is he crazy or what?

187
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,890
-He is insane.
-See? I was right to be suspicious, huh?

188
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:25,390
"I want to be friends with him,
so cook for us"?

189
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,270
Are you shameless?
Where's your conscience?

190
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:31,230
Besides, we didn't actually
find his phone for him.

191
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,610
Be quiet.

192
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,650
I have a plan.

193
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,330
Everyone gets to go home except me…

194
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,250
Wait.

195
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,790
It's you.

196
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,630
Am I right?

197
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,000
What do you say?

198
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,300
You with a nice build.
You really aren't interested in archery?

199
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,050
Why are you doing this to me?
Please get a grip.

200
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,970
No, you're the one that should get a grip.

201
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,390
Your build…

202
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,720
Goodness, all this…

203
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:12,480
You shouldn't let it
go to waste like this.

204
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,520
But I will.

205
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,610
-It's a loss for the country.
-No, it isn't.

206
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:16,690
Why, you…

207
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,660
Gyeon-u's misfortune is so powerful
that one amulet isn't enough.

208
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,790
Amulets are more effective
when there are many

209
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,920
and especially if they're in a place
he stays long.

210
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,800
I get it now.
So you asked for a home-cooked meal

211
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,670
-to stash them at his place--
-Shush.

212
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,920
Keep Gyeon-u and his grandmother
away from home.

213
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:44,470
I'll go hide the amulets in the meantime.

214
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,050
Thanks for having me.

215
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,640
I said thanks for having me.

216
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,100
Please let me in.

217
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:50,700
Thank you for the invite.

218
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,920
Hey.

219
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,340
-Have a seat here.
-Okay.

220
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,090
Thanks.

221
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,300
By the way, where's your room?

222
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,010
Why?

223
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,770
I'm just curious.

224
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:13,930
Don't be.

225
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,310
You stay put right there
until Grandma returns with groceries.

226
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,060
-Why? I want to look around.
-No, don't move.

227
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,270
Sit down.

228
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,650
Stay seated.

229
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:24,570
Only on the cushion.

230
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,950
JINI BUTCHER SHOP

231
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,510
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

232
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,300
I'm sorry,

233
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,630
but I'm actually vegan.

234
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,220
I only eat plant-based food.

235
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,050
I can't eat meat.

236
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,470
Oh, really?

237
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:54,890
Yes.

238
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,480
So, why don't we get out of here?

239
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:17,750
What are you doing?

240
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,500
I'm sitting on the cushion.

241
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,670
Should I kick you out?

242
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:33,970
No.

243
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,810
This is for you.

244
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,360
Did you heat it up?

245
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,150
It's warm.

246
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,070
How sweet.

247
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,580
Don't drink it. Give it back.

248
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,210
But why?

249
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,460
Just do as I say.

250
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,840
-No, it's my water.
-Let go.

251
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,920
Hey.

252
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,170
But…

253
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,180
What is it?

254
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,390
Why?

255
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,110
You started it.

256
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,600
What?

257
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,930
Oh, my.

258
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,640
You must be hungry.
Let me whip something up quickly.

259
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:06,020
You spilled it.

260
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,230
It wasn't my fault. Don't kick me out.

261
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,690
What is it?

262
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,990
-What's with this weird vibe?
-What do you mean?

263
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,160
Why did you get
a bunch of rabbit food only?

264
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm vegan now.

265
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,080
What?

266
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:27,330
Gee, you must be hungry.

267
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,710
Have your fill. I prepared plenty.

268
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,130
-Thank you for the meal.
-Thank you for the meal.

269
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,130
Here you go.

270
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,840
-Let's eat.
-Yes, ma'am.

271
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:41,350
-Here.
-You first, Grandma.

272
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,770
This is so good.

273
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,770
It's amazing, ma'am.

274
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,820
-This tastes wonderful.
-Thanks. Enjoy.

275
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,960
She raised you so well by herself.

276
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,590
Be good to her, dude.

277
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,590
What I meant is…

278
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:16,680
You know,

279
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:21,760
his parents are working overseas.

280
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,810
They left him with me,

281
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:27,020
and they're so busy with work
that they can't come by often.

282
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,270
But we keep in touch with them.

283
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,320
They call all the time too.

284
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,320
Right, Gyeon-u?

285
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,070
I'm sorry. I crossed the line.

286
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,450
Don't be. It's okay.

287
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:42,490
Hurry up and eat.

288
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,700
Eat up.

289
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:47,670
I'm an adoptee.

290
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:55,210
I haven't met my birth parents
for over a decade.

291
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,840
I live with my adoptive mother.

292
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,390
You could say she's good with knives,

293
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,390
but she is a terrible cook.

294
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,520
I can't cook anything edible either.

295
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,930
I've never had japchae this good.

296
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,690
It's so good.

297
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,610
I love it.

298
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:19,910
Gee.

299
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,160
Eat as much as you want. There's plenty.

300
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,540
Here. Feel free to have your fill.

301
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:29,080
Thank you. Yes! Thank you.

302
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,380
It's really good.

303
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,470
Seong-a, was it?

304
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,430
She's such a strong girl. Right?

305
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,890
Do I look like one?

306
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,400
I'm not sure if she's strong

307
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,570
or putting up an act.

308
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,170
-Let's talk.
-Huh?

309
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,670
What is it?

310
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,140
You were adopted?

311
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,980
Well, not on paper.

312
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:33,440
My birth parents left me with my mother
when I was eight and haven't returned.

313
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,570
Do people usually…

314
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,570
talk about such matters so nonchalantly?

315
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,030
I wouldn't know.
It's not a very usual matter, after all.

316
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,710
But it really isn't a big deal.

317
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:54,330
If it is, people talk
like Gyeon-u's grandmother just did.

318
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,920
They tell an obvious lie.

319
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,090
Ironically, it becomes more obvious.

320
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,380
That's how it is.

321
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:06,050
Put up a brave front, and they pity you.
If you seem sad, they look down on you.

322
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,810
If you hide the truth to avoid all that,

323
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,890
then it really becomes your weakness.

324
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,980
If it's not a big deal,

325
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,440
you must share it nonchalantly
to keep it from becoming a big deal.

326
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,870
BAE GYEON-U

327
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,210
Isn't this Gyeon-u's room?

328
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,130
I think it is.

329
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:38,960
Well done, Ji-ho.

330
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,380
This is the last amulet.

331
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,050
Where should I hide it?

332
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,640
Oh, maybe in there.

333
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,680
Let me help you.

334
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,850
What was that?

335
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,580
I'm such an idiot.

336
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,950
That kid from earlier…

337
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,370
That was Gyeon-u, Bae Gyeon-u.

339
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,960
-Look over here, Mr. Bae Gyeon-u.
-We'll take it now.

340
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,630
-Grandma, come here.
-Look here, too.

341
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,010
Let's take one together.

342
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,340
Here.

343
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,770
-Good job.
-Thanks.

344
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,900
One, two, three.

NATIONAL SPORTS COMPETITION
MEN'S HIGH SCHOOL RECURVE, WINNER

348
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:54,290
So you're an archer?

349
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:56,000
You must be good.
Look at all these gold medals.

350
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,630
You're right.
Can we come watch you sometime?

351
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:01,840
I quit.

352
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,680
Going through other people's stuff
in their place…

353
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:11,220
Isn't it out of line?

354
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:20,650
What's wrong? Are you hurt? Let me see.

355
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:24,440
No, I'm not hurt.

356
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,240
Seong-a's not hurt. I am.

357
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:30,530
-Hey.
-Hey, what's wrong?

358
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,080
Hey. What's wrong? Are you okay?

359
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,410
My feelings…

360
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,620
My feelings are severely hurt.

361
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,130
Oh, it hurts.

362
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,800
I'm sorry. I'm the one who made the mess.

363
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,970
Ji-ho did nothing wrong. I'll clean it up.

364
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,550
Hello?

365
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,930
Lady Fairy. Where are you?

366
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,770
The clients are waiting.

367
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,190
Oh, right.

368
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,440
All right.

369
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:07,780
Sorry, I have to go to my part-time job.

370
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,900
I'll clean this mess up another time.

371
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,860
I'm really sorry, but I'm late.

372
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,290
-Wait.
-Good night, ma'am.

373
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,410
Oh, no.

374
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,830
She finishes late every night.
She can't come back here.

375
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,040
Whatever. That nutjob.

376
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,510
Wait.

377
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,800
-Here.
-My purse.

378
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:34,720
Thank you.

379
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,680
Wait.

380
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,350
-Thank you, Heaven and Earth Fairy.
-You're welcome.

381
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,560
What?

382
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,110
Wait. How did you know?

383
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,730
I thought you were Gyeon-u.

384
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,480
Give me the amulet and his phone.

385
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:51,860
Thank you.

386
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,530
I'll save him.

387
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,530
I'll fend off all misfortune.

388
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,990
I promise you

389
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,290
to free him from misfortune
after the next three weeks.

390
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:06,040
Let's talk more next time.

391
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,460
I'm on my way, ma'am.

392
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,350
What you saw today…

393
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,060
I won't care if you tell others about it
or gossip behind my back,

394
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:24,600
but don't act like we're friends.

395
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:25,810
Tell Seong-a this too.

396
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,730
What do you mean?

397
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,190
I don't want to be your friend.

398
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:32,990
Is it because

399
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,820
we dropped all these?

400
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,160
It was an honest mistake--

401
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,870
Don't be mistaken.

402
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:39,990
I have nothing against you two.

403
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,500
I just don't like people.

404
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,000
You're a way bigger nutjob than Seong-a.

405
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:54,220
Bae Gyeon-u from Joonghyun High?

406
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:58,300
I'm sure he was kicked out.
His archery career is over.

407
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,820
Gyeon-u,
don't you want to apologize to me?

408
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,250
A gold medalist.

409
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,040
Every time he competed, he won gold.

410
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:30,380
That's why even though
he started the fire in the dorm,

411
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,250
they decided to transfer him
and cover it up.

412
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,010
They didn't even report it to the police.

413
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:38,640
Arson is a serious crime.
Is it okay to cover it up?

414
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,850
My point exactly.

415
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:42,760
Why send him to another school
when he should be in juvie?

416
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,520
To our class, at that.

417
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,770
What should we do, Beom?

418
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,520
-I'm terrified.
-Stop it. You're heavy.

419
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,320
What's so funny this fine morning?

420
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,290
Seong-a.

421
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,210
Seong-a!

422
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,130
What's up?

423
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,720
Did Gyeon-u not say anything?

424
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,640
No, he didn't say a thing.

425
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,390
I said hi as soon as I saw him
this morning, but he didn't say it back.

426
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:27,770
Even so, you're smiling?

427
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:35,400
Don't act like we're friends.
Tell Seong-a this too.

428
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,780
He doesn't want to be friends with us.

429
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,660
-He asked me to tell you this.
-What?

430
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,830
Why? What's the reason?

431
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:47,000
The newbie is an arsonist.

432
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,080
Stay away from him. Far away.

433
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,380
I wouldn't know.

434
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,590
Maybe he's just a troubled teenager.

435
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,440
Oh, right. Have you heard?

436
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,730
The new student in Class Two.

437
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,690
-You know, the handsome one.
-Yeah?

438
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:17,780
-I heard he's an arsonist.
-For real?

439
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,200
Yeah, he was forced to transfer here
after he started a fire.

440
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,110
What the heck? That's so scary.

441
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:43,260
-An arsonist?
-Don't look at him.

442
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,800
A new student who's an arsonist.

443
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,390
Don't look.

444
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,770
-Why would he start a fire?
-What?

445
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,230
Let's go.

446
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:55,060
Has he lost his mind?

447
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,730
Why would he start a fire?

448
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,860
How annoying.

449
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,210
You don't mind me sitting here, right?

450
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,000
Over here, Ji-ho.

451
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,340
This looks good.

452
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,970
Hey, it's good.

453
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:24,220
I already told you
I don't want to be your friend.

454
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,010
Are you pitying me?

455
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:33,310
Did you not hear the rumors?

456
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,060
We did.

457
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,560
The meat is good.

458
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:40,900
You're not eating?

459
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,150
Come on,
you need to eat meat to get taller.

460
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,070
You said no to a murderer
even if he was handsome.

461
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:48,780
Do you not mind other stuff?

462
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:52,040
Arsonists are a big no too.
They're just as dangerous.

463
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,660
Then?

464
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,380
Those cursed with misfortune always have
big accidents happening around them.

465
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,550
All kinds of evil spirits
pounce on them to kill them.

466
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,800
I see more than others, remember?

467
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,010
I believe in what I see, not some rumors.

468
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,680
-What exactly did you see?
-That he is a good person.

469
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,930
He's the type to heat up water for you

470
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,650
when that's all he had to offer.

471
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,480
To make it warm.

472
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,950
-I'm home.
-Welcome back.

473
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,000
Oh, something smells good.

474
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,750
Why did you make so much?

475
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,470
To share it with a neighborhood friend.

476
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:47,720
You already made a friend
in this neighborhood?

477
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,850
She's so nice
that we hit it off immediately.

478
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,060
I'll be back soon.

479
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,640
-Why don't I walk you there?
-Have dinner before it goes cold.

480
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,020
But…

481
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:23,750
I noticed how much you enjoyed japchae
the other day.

482
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,550
You're right. I love it.

483
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:28,760
Oh, my goodness.

484
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,970
-Take your time.
-You cannot go in there.

485
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:33,640
I just need to check something.

486
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,650
Gyeon-u.

487
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,150
What are you doing?

488
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:52,200
Now you're making her cook for you too?

489
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,530
Wait.

490
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:57,080
What is it? Was scamming
and squeezing money out of us not enough?

491
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,040
I get you're shameless,
but this is way out of line!

492
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:03,630
"Shameless"?

493
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,460
Gyeon-u, it's not like that.

494
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:08,420
-Let's get out of here.
-Wait, Gyeon-u. Oh, dear.

495
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,090
I'm so sorry.

496
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,890
Gyeon-u. Hear me out.

497
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:14,600
It's not what you think.

498
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,940
Lady Fairy. Are you okay?

499
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,980
His temper has gotten worse.

500
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:31,200
Goodness, you must be shaken up.

501
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,530
Ma'am.

502
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,240
What's wrong with Gyeon-u?

503
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,620
I don't get it either.
His grandmother is such a gentle soul.

504
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:44,040
Who does he take after?

505
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,750
No.

506
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,630
That's not what I meant.

507
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:01,890
I think he'll burn to death this time.

508
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:05,100
Oh, dear.

509
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:09,480
Why are you always on the brink of death?

510
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,030
You handsome boy.

511
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,990
Gyeon-u. I'm sorry.

512
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:17,490
I'm really sorry.

513
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,160
I'm sorry I upset you, Gyeon-u.

514
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,370
I'm sorry, Gyeon-u.

515
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,670
Why are you apologizing to me?

516
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,550
It's all because of me.

517
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,340
I'm at fault

518
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,630
for making you be at her beck and call!

519
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,140
I'm not mad at you.

520
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,190
I'm mad at myself.

521
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,940
You didn't do anything wrong.

522
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,120
Gyeon-u.

523
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,850
Don't trust anyone.

524
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:00,390
You're taking out the trash?
But it's only filled halfway.

525
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:03,720
I have to go sweep as a punishment anyway.

526
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,900
He really scared me.

527
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,150
-He scared me so much.
-Wow.

528
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:13,070
He wasn't leaving.

529
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:14,980
He was being forced out.

530
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,100
Where's Gyeon-u?

531
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,310
That's all you have to say to me?

532
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,690
Hi. Where's Gyeon-u?

533
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,060
He went out to sort waste.

534
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,980
-To the storage?
-Yeah.

535
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,620
This shouldn't be here.

536
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,330
What's that smoke?

537
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,920
What's that?

538
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:18,510
Isn't that a fire?

539
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,930
-Where?
-Over there.

540
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,020
Hello? This is Park Seong-a,
Gyeon-u's friend.

541
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,440
He can't answer right now--

542
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,770
What was that? They hung up.

543
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:36,940
Never mind.

544
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:49,330
"General Dongcheon

545
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,710
is the biggest dum-dum"?

546
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,680
GENERAL DONGCHEON IS THE BIGGEST DUM-DUM

547
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,930
Damn it.

548
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:10,350
Flower Master!

549
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,250
Help me!

550
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,050
Help me!

551
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:43,720
Please help me!

552
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,590
It's all because of me.

553
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,220
I'm sorry.

554
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:03,990
Get a grip.

555
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,950
I'm sorry, Hui-na.

556
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:07,990
It's all because of me.

557
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,200
Hui-na, please.

558
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:15,000
Gyeon-u,
don't you want to apologize to me?

559
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,710
CHOI HUI-NA

560
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,670
I want to apologize to you.

561
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,340
I wish you would just die.

562
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,510
Okay. I will.

563
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,430
Gyeon-u. Bae Gyeon-u!

564
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,820
Gyeon-u. Bae Gyeon-u!

565
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,080
Gyeon-u.

566
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,370
Go.

567
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,620
Don't come near me.

568
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:33,160
Salt won't last us long.

569
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,870
-Gyeon-u.
-You leave.

570
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:36,450
Gyeon-u, let's get…

571
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:13,430
Let's get out of here

572
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,260
together.

573
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:18,680
ACCIDENT REPORT

574
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,730
Why does Gyeon-u
need to write an accident report?

575
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:23,890
What do you mean
he could've started the fire on purpose?

576
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:26,190
That is why I'm asking him
to write up the report.

577
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,150
I'm trying to find out
what exactly happened.

578
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,190
He's a victim who was trapped inside.

579
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,280
She's right. Gyeon-u almost died.

580
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,280
What could I do
when people keep voicing concerns?

581
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:38,910
They say it's because of the rumor
trailing after him.

582
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:41,370
I need to find out
the exact circumstance--

583
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:42,830
Circumstance?

584
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:45,960
The only circumstance I see is the one
where you're accusing him without proof.

585
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,460
What more must we consider?

586
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:48,710
Why, you…

587
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:51,090
Have you always been this eloquent?

588
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,220
It's refreshing to see you like this
instead of napping.

589
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,380
Sir.

590
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:56,590
Stop badgering me and ask him directly.

591
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,760
I asked him to explain
how the arsonist rumor came to be,

592
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:02,060
but he said he'd write a report instead.

593
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,730
Don't accuse me of being a bad teacher.
He made the choice.

594
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:09,480
-But--
-Get going. I'm busy.

595
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:10,570
Go take a nap.

596
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:16,490
I'M SORRY…

597
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:19,280
TEACHERS' OFFICE

598
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:26,000
Thank you for saving my life earlier.

599
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,460
It was just an accident.

600
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,960
So why don't you explain it?
Why do you do as you're told?

601
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:33,840
It makes it look like…

602
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:37,720
you actually started the fire.

603
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:44,770
Do you have proof I didn't do it?

604
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:46,600
Do you?

605
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:49,060
I saw what happened.
Ji-ho, too. We both did.

606
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:50,360
You came to save me.

607
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:54,320
-I'm the only one who saw the fire start.
-Did anyone see you start it?

608
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:57,990
You said laughing about a bad thing
doesn't change it into a good thing.

609
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:01,660
So you won't do anything about it?
How does that help?

610
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,620
Why act as if it's not your business?

611
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:04,910
What about you?

612
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,080
Why are you meddling
as if it's your business?

613
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,790
Are you so desperate
to help out a pitiful guy?

614
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:13,000
If you want to help anyone,
go to the restroom and look in the mirror.

615
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:14,760
Do you know how pitiful your smile is?

616
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:27,810
My point is…

617
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:31,980
stay away if you don't want to
end up more pitiful.

618
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,530
Who cares if I started the fire or not?

619
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:38,570
If everyone thinks I did, I did it.

620
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,710
That slippery Fire Ghost.

621
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:58,010
He's run off already.

622
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:01,590
You said you're depressed,
but you're getting your job done.

623
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,140
Why did they have to build the school
in this crappy place

624
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:05,970
and have ghosts acting out?

625
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,730
So, you're going to continue
with your "Saving Bae Gyeon-u" project?

626
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,860
I should, but I don't know.

627
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:19,740
When I get one step closer,

628
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:24,660
I want him to just take one step back,
but he takes about ten steps back.

629
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,620
It makes me feel terrible.

630
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:29,870
That's understandable.

631
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,250
You went through so much
only to be told to get lost.

632
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:35,090
Come on, he didn't tell me to get lost.

633
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:37,000
He just told me not to come close.

634
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:38,630
Same difference.

635
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:44,640
Is it because of his misfortune?
He seems to mistreat others too.

636
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:49,230
That wasn't funny.

637
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:51,100
You bet it was.

638
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:58,280
-Focus.
-Yes, sir.

639
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,400
-Release with confidence.
-Yes, sir.

640
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:02,200
Keep the anchoring arm close.

641
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,370
-Shoot as you always have.
-Yes, sir.

642
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,960
Gosh, here comes the star athlete.

643
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:13,830
To what do I owe this pleasure?

644
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:18,170
I got a call from Coach Jeong.

645
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:20,670
I won't join this team.

646
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:23,300
You little punk.

647
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:25,390
-I didn't even start talk--
-I won't.

648
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,860
We're closed today.

649
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,580
We're not open today.

650
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,000
You're not a client.

651
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:00,050
Please come in.

652
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:04,260
Gyeon-u won't open up to you, right?

653
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,640
It's not that he won't open up.

654
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,850
He's closed shut.

655
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:09,720
He is like a deserted island

656
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:12,980
where anyone is forbidden to enter.

657
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:15,600
You're right.

658
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:17,270
It'll take a lot of effort

659
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,320
to make your way into his heart.

660
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:24,490
Every time he built a bridge
connecting his island to the land,

661
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:26,570
people broke it mercilessly.

662
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:28,870
Even his own parents

663
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,870
don't want to be in touch with him.

664
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:37,790
Gyeon-u has been cursed with misfortune.

665
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,500
Since his birth.

666
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,260
"Die, little one."

667
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:45,720
That's what the world
seemed to be telling him

668
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,090
as accidents struck him nonstop.

669
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:54,600
Gyeon-u.

670
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:57,940
Gyeon-u.

671
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:02,320
Gyeon-u, are you okay?

672
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:13,910
We've tried every method out there
to free him from his darn misfortune.

673
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,370
We've traveled all across the country

674
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:21,790
to see shamans and fortune-tellers
who made a name for themselves.

675
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:25,210
That must've been rough.

676
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:28,680
Oh, no.

677
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:30,890
It wasn't rough at all.

678
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:36,310
He has always shown me
such a beautiful smile.

679
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:40,940
Even after facing
near-death experiences so many times,

680
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:43,020
he has never feared anything

681
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:45,230
or gotten intimidated.

682
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:49,320
His smile always reminded me of sunlight
falling on flowering trees in spring.

683
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:52,070
It wasn't rough at all.

684
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:54,410
He's kept my heart full.

685
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:01,460
You'd think

686
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:05,300
that misfortune kills a person, right?

687
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:08,550
That's not true.

688
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:12,180
Being called names for being unlucky,

689
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:16,970
listening to parents yell at their kids
not to hang out with you,

690
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:20,730
or having to endure
terrible people's nasty jokes

691
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:22,650
about making bets on when you'll die…

692
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:27,280
If a living person
is treated like they're dead,

693
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:30,820
that person starts to fade away
from that point

694
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:34,830
little by little.

695
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:37,450
It's people…

696
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:40,160
that kill another person.

697
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:43,460
Are you seriously giving up archery?

698
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,040
Yes.

699
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:47,050
You must've heard of the Bae Gyeon-u jinx.

700
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:48,340
I sure have.

701
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,630
Major accidents happened
at every competition he attended.

702
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,680
A bus was overturned,
the ceiling broke down,

703
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,550
and the athletes got food poisoning--

704
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,220
He must be haunted or something.

705
00:50:57,310 --> 00:50:59,600
Bad things continue to happen around him.

706
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,770
But as you know, what is archery about?

707
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:05,060
It's about keeping composure.
All those incidents got to the athletes.

708
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:07,900
My team isn't on top anymore.

709
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:10,690
Our ranking tanked after Gyeon-u joined.

710
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:14,110
Didn't Bae Gyeon-u win gold medals
every time he competed?

711
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,870
Only Gyeon-u did well. Just him.

712
00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:18,830
And that's worse.

713
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:20,580
Oh, I get it now.

714
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:23,830
So the jealous kids framed him for arson

715
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,130
-and you coaches looked the other way?
-No.

716
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:29,050
The one who identified him as the arsonist

717
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:31,720
-was Gyeon-u himself.
-What?

718
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,930
He claimed the fire started
because of him.

719
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:37,300
He said that he didn't start it
but he was the cause of the fire.

720
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:42,520
So, his teammates complained about him
not being punished despite his confession,

721
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,100
and the team spirit was trashed.

722
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:46,150
What should the coach do?

723
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:48,230
I had to make a choice

724
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:51,280
whether to side with Gyeon-u
or the other kids.

725
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,700
That's why I let go of Gyeon-u.

726
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:00,490
Oh, my.

727
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,460
First of all, you…

728
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:06,750
You'll never be Jesus.

729
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:10,630
You abandoned the lost sheep
to save the other 99 sheep.

730
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,590
That's fine. I'll take him in.

731
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:19,050
Yours truly used to be
a children's Bible camp teacher.

732
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:21,970
I'm an expert in taking in lost sheep.

733
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:24,180
I'll get going.

734
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,770
Wait, Ju-seop.

735
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:28,440
He really isn't easy.

736
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,820
Do you think I'm easy?

737
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:34,110
Why did you pick up archery
in the first place?

738
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:39,030
My grandmother liked me doing archery.

739
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,990
See? Look at that.

740
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:45,750
Then what's the problem?
Keep working on it.

741
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:49,880
When you won gold in the last competition,
your grandmother was over the moon.

742
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:54,090
I didn't quit because I was an outcast.

743
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,010
Give it enough time,

744
00:52:57,630 --> 00:53:00,100
and you get used to others disliking you.

745
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:04,520
Besides, I don't need anyone else
besides my grandmother.

746
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,560
The thing is…

747
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:11,900
every time she comes to see me compete,

748
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:15,690
she sees the others hating on me.

749
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,950
No one needs to know all that.

750
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,370
Having her see it…

751
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,700
I just can't stand it.

752
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:30,880
Goodbye.

753
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:32,590
I won't see you again.

754
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:46,730
My dear lost sheep.

755
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:49,140
You're so sweet and cute.

756
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,020
You're perfect for archery.

757
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:55,190
My dear Gyeon-u.

758
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:58,110
My poor baby.

759
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:01,780
I feel bad when I look into his eyes.

760
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:06,120
I feel bad
when I look at his nose or his lips.

761
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,960
I feel bad when I hold his hands.

762
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:12,630
I always feel bad for him.

763
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,090
It seems

764
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,430
saying you're sorry is your way
of saying you love him.

765
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:27,810
All those people

766
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:31,230
never apologize to Gyeon-u.

767
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:33,810
Even when an apology is called for,

768
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:36,190
they never say they're sorry.

769
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:41,950
Since no one apologizes to him,

770
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,950
Gyeon-u thinks that he's at fault.

771
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,740
He believes he's the bad apple.

772
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:53,040
That's why I apologize to him instead.

773
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:59,420
I'm trying to give him all the apologies

774
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:04,010
the world has never given to him.

775
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:07,680
I remind him
that he didn't do anything wrong

776
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,730
and that he isn't a bad person.

777
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:18,360
But I still…

778
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:23,070
haven't told him
all that he needs to hear.

779
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:36,210
Lady Fairy.

780
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:38,960
My Gyeon-u…

781
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,090
is truly all alone now.

782
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:46,390
Grandma.

783
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:47,470
119

784
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:50,680
Grandma.

785
00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:56,730
Grandma.

786
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:02,490
Oh, no. Grandma.

787
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,170
Just once…

788
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,340
Just this once…

789
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:25,050
Could you please go hold Gyeon-u's hand?

790
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:38,810
I passed on too quickly
that I didn't get the chance

791
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:42,320
to help him back up.

792
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:02,630
I'm sorry.

793
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:05,300
I realize…

794
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:08,590
I'm asking a lot.

795
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:15,020
Ma'am, I think you're underestimating me.

796
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:18,060
You see…

797
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:22,400
I'm not nice to someone just once.

798
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:26,740
Once I've decided to be nice to someone,
I'm always nice to them.

799
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:30,780
I won't change
even if there's a change of heart.

800
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:34,540
Just as gods don't abandon humans,

801
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:37,580
just as moms don't abandon their children,

802
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,290
I will continue

803
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:43,130
to be kind to him.

804
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,130
Gyeon-u…

805
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,180
I will save his life.

806
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:28,800
Gyeon-u.

807
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:31,930
It's quite dark there, isn't it?

808
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:37,270
I know that the only star
in your life just fell.

809
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:42,190
I know that your world
has gone completely dark.

810
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,900
FUNERAL HALL

811
00:58:57,410 --> 00:58:59,330
I can't fathom
how difficult it'd be to imagine light

812
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:01,040
when you're surrounded by darkness.

813
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:11,930
From this point onward,

814
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,260
I'll keep reaching out to you.

815
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:19,140
THE LATE OH OK-SUN
REST IN PEACE

816
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:48,300
I'm sorry that this is who I am,

817
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:50,920
someone you dislike.

818
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:56,470
Wait.

819
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:01,640
What are you doing?

820
01:00:02,770 --> 01:00:03,850
How dare you show up here?

821
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:07,020
What? Can I not be here?

822
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:09,650
Do you even hear yourself?

823
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:13,490
Leave.

824
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:16,320
Go on. Get out of here.

825
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:20,450
Can't you hear me? Get out of here!

826
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:22,080
Get lost!

827
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:26,120
Even so, I will save you…

828
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:27,830
You little brat.

829
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:30,170
…in the way you hate.

830
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:34,170
Do you think I'm here for you?

831
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:35,930
I'm here to see your grandmother.

832
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:39,550
I won't leave you alone.

833
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:20,850
SPECIAL THANKS TO GIL HAE-YEON

834
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:23,140
I heard your grandmother passed away.

835
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:24,890
She's finally free from you.

836
01:01:24,970 --> 01:01:28,190
Must you defame her
even on her final journey?

837
01:01:28,270 --> 01:01:29,190
I'm sorry

838
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:31,610
for being the source
of your unhappiness, Grandma.

839
01:01:31,690 --> 01:01:34,190
I may not get him to understand,
but I can protect him.

840
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,950
If I have no choice but to be hated
by him, so be it.

841
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:39,030
I'll just focus on
what I can do right now.

842
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:41,910
It's a surprise
that only three have died so far.

843
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:43,620
Even ghosts die over there.

844
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:45,660
This is not a human being.

845
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:47,910
It's a ghost in a shell of a human being.

846
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,420
Hello.

847
