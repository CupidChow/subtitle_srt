1
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:36,305
All right.

2
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,934
Let's keep the lip balm.

3
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,553
Drink that. You seem cold.

4
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:00,681
Thanks.

5
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:07,479
Leave it.

6
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:09,690
I'd rather not get it wet. I'm fine.

7
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:12,067
Well, I'm not.

8
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:13,152
I'll get another one.

9
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:14,153
No, I really…

10
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,533
Sorry.

11
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:23,829
Drink that. You might catch a cold.

12
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:01,033
What happened to these photos?

13
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:03,118
What are you doing?

14
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:04,870
Who did this?

15
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:07,706
No one should draw this amulet
on a person's face.

16
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,624
What are you doing?

17
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:11,502
Someone drew an Ward Off Evil Amulet
on the photo and erased it.

18
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,296
This is a spell to chase away ghosts.

19
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,839
You shouldn't draw it on a person's face.

20
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:17,508
I know that.

21
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:19,218
You do?

22
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:20,469
I do.

23
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,554
-And that's why I erased it all.
-Who told you

24
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:24,473
erasing it would cancel out the curse?

25
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:30,604
Drawing it on a living person's face
may not be all that terrible,

26
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:33,649
but it's a different story if the person's
been dead for less than 49 days.

27
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:36,068
It's asking the King of Hell
to curse the dead.

28
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:39,196
It's a strong curse
condemning your grandmother to hell.

29
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,699
Erasing it alone isn't enough.

30
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:44,952
So,

31
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:46,537
the target wasn't me

32
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:49,915
but my grandma?

33
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:54,920
These photos…

34
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:57,881
We must burn them, Gyeon-U.

35
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,849
What happened?
You look like you barely escaped drowning.

36
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:09,435
I told you it'd be a waste of time.

37
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:12,563
You really don't know
where Yeomhwa might be?

38
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:19,111
What are you looking at?

39
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:20,029
A photo album.

40
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:21,822
Your old photos.

41
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,037
Isn't my Seong-A adorable?

42
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:30,873
Are you cross-eyed?

43
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,923
<i>Erasing the ink won't undo the curse.</i>

44
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:42,718
A wish doesn't get canceled that easily.

45
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,679
A wish to cause harm to others

46
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,974
also counts as a wish, after all.

47
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,436
No wonder.

48
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:54,563
I thought it was weird.

49
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,109
My wish never came true.

50
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:03,489
I wished for an ordinary life
with my grandma, but that never came true.

51
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,409
That person's wishes
would always come true.

52
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,955
"That person"?

53
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:14,750
Do you know who drew these?

54
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,085
Can we meet them right now?

55
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:17,002
What if you do?

56
00:06:17,086 --> 00:06:17,961
I'll ask them

57
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:20,964
to take back their wish.

58
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,758
We'll do a cleansing rite

59
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,927
and a rite to pray
your grandmother reaches the afterlife.

60
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,722
Then, you can keep these photos.

61
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:30,224
Sure.

62
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,935
She might grant you a favor

63
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:36,730
though she'd never bat an eye
even if I got on my knees.

64
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:40,567
You know the person who drew these.

65
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:44,613
It's the shaman you danced with.

66
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,115
She drew these.

67
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:52,830
<i>She said she was one of the shamans</i>
<i>Great Aunt had called.</i>

68
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,165
That's a complete lie.

69
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,084
That witch beat us to it.

70
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,418
She cast a spell that turns anyone

71
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:00,504
entering that shack
into an offering to the evil spirit.

72
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,048
I don't get you yet.

73
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,760
Why are you nice to me
when you're so close to Yeomhwa?

74
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:12,349
Are you two having fun together
toying with me?

75
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,728
By any chance,

76
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,149
if you're toying with me right now…

77
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:24,611
can you let me off just this once?

78
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:28,657
My grandma's photos…

79
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,119
really mean a lot to me.

80
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:43,422
I beg of you…

81
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:47,718
Heaven and Earth Fairy.

82
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:05,777
My hands are so cold.

83
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:09,781
I'm sorry.

84
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:22,586
I know you won't believe me…

85
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,383
but I met Yeomhwa for the first time
at the abandoned house.

86
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,219
She's really a stranger to me.

87
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,012
And I have

88
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,349
no plans or intentions

89
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:39,353
to toy with you or anyone else,
ghosts included.

90
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:43,857
I don't want to make others cry.

91
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:07,589
Isn't it good?

92
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:09,258
-Good choice, right?
-Where should we go later?

93
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:16,223
So you like it?

94
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:27,276
WHO IS IMMANUEL KANT?

95
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,531
How about this?

96
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:34,741
What?

97
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,285
Well…

98
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:39,371
It sucks.

99
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:41,623
That hurts.

100
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:45,877
So do better.

101
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:47,671
That's what people like you do.

102
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,090
I should be praised for doing it at all.

103
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,260
-Are you proud of that?
-I'm not ashamed.

104
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:55,804
You should be, though.

105
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:01,601
Are you ashamed of me?
Is that why you're so mean to me?

106
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,566
I'm not being mean at all. I just…

107
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,069
Hey, that's Gyeon-U.

108
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:12,571
What? Gyeon-U?

109
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,114
I'll be back soon.

110
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:15,657
What? Hey.

111
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:17,075
Where are you going?

112
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,201
To touch Gyeon-U.

113
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,080
To touch him? What for?

114
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:26,710
Gyeon-U!

115
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:31,631
You can't get on through that door.

116
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:32,674
Sorry.

117
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,577
It's pretty obvious he's off to see H.

118
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:05,665
I'd like to see her face.

119
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,336
And hurt her feelings while I'm at it.

120
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:16,968
I guess the family
just can't agree on anything.

121
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:18,970
I've opened this case so many times.

122
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,640
I won't be long.

123
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:25,519
<i>Ma'am. I just need to check.</i>

124
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,565
<i>She wouldn't have stopped</i>
<i>at drawing Ward Off Evil Amulet.</i>

125
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,527
<i>At least, I wouldn't have.</i>

126
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:36,863
<i>This is…</i>

127
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:13,525
What do you think you're doing?

128
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,154
Have you been well, Father?

129
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:20,490
<i>"Father"?</i>

130
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,826
Did you get permission before coming here?

131
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:26,705
-Go home.
-I want to talk to the shaman.

132
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,124
-What?
-I want to ask her something.

133
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:32,085
Go home for now. I'll call you.

134
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:33,003
I know

135
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,047
you won't call me.

136
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:39,718
The shaman is the only one
who has my number.

137
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:42,762
The rest of you didn't save my number
in case my misfortune rubbed off on you.

138
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:47,434
I can't reach the shaman.
It says the number has been disconnected.

139
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,853
I'm not asking this for my sake.

140
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,316
This is about Grandma.

141
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,068
You dare mention my mother?

142
00:12:57,152 --> 00:13:00,697
I won't move an inch until you get her.

143
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:07,704
I'll speak with the shaman and then leave.

144
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:11,833
I won't approach or touch anyone else.

145
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:14,127
I won't answer even if I'm spoken to.

146
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:19,174
I promise.

147
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:24,179
Let's be honest.
She's adorable in this photo.

148
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,142
How exactly?

149
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:30,185
Where? Her gums?

150
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:31,102
You little…

151
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:39,569
Welcome back, adorable fairy.

152
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,908
I found a Ghoul-Making Amulet.
We must cleanse it immediately.

153
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,201
AMULET THAT TURNS A SOUL INTO A GHOUL

154
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,119
How did this vile thing
end up in your hands?

155
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:52,457
I know both the shaman who cast the curse

156
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,417
and the deceased who was targeted.

157
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,965
Then you do meet
the requirements for cleansing it.

158
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:03,426
But first things first. You said you knew
this shaman who made the amulet.

159
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,678
Why do you know them?

160
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:06,221
How do you know them?

161
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:08,306
It's Yeomhwa.

162
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:15,605
Yeomhwa is the one

163
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:17,566
who made this amulet.

164
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:20,860
<i>You're pretty gutsy.</i>

165
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:25,031
You want me to cleanse
the amulet on the photos?

166
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,576
Well…

167
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:31,413
My grandmother did nothing wrong.

168
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:36,251
It's not like

169
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:40,171
you were born a Newly-Dead
because you did anything wrong.

170
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:43,466
You're innocent too.

171
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,178
Just…

172
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:48,847
I'm begging here.

173
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:53,435
Don't you know what I do?

174
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:56,938
Misfortune will flock to you,

175
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,316
and blocking that is my priority.

176
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,736
Don't let the misfortune
seep into this family

177
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,071
and take it all with you, Newly-Dead.

178
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:27,093
So there was a reason you got gutsy.

179
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,721
Your grandmother died
because of you only recently,

180
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,514
but you found an ally already?

181
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:41,524
After I write this…

182
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:42,567
And then the final touch.

183
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,236
-Is that right?
-Yes.

184
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:57,999
Wait, but the lines…

185
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,584
Is this it?

186
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:00,585
Give it here. I'll do it.

187
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:03,129
You don't know the deceased.

188
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:05,048
Stay put. Seong-A has to do it.

189
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:08,468
Sorry.

190
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:12,847
I've made a lot of these,
but I've never cleansed one.

191
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:15,016
I didn't realize

192
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,894
you've had your spirit-daughter
curse others.

193
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,315
It was before I met Mother.

194
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,652
I was with my birth parents then.

195
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:28,905
Keep your focus.

196
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,909
I am focused.

197
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,451
I tried running just in case.

198
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,189
The curse on Oh Ok-sun,
born in 1951, the Year of the Rabbit,

199
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:45,607
shall be undone as of now.

200
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,901
May it be done immediately.

201
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:50,111
-May it be done immediately.
-May it be done immediately.

202
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:13,635
Well done.

203
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:15,762
You're good at this.

204
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:18,056
We'll wrap things up now.

205
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:19,766
You must be exhausted.

206
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:22,727
Go get some rest.

207
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:25,271
Yes. Rest up.

208
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:27,816
Thank you.

209
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,702
MISSED CALLS
PYO JI-HO

210
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:49,838
The cleansing.

211
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,383
Can't we do it out here?

212
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:55,969
We must do it inside. It's inside.

213
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:57,679
What's inside?

214
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:08,731
Something that doesn't suit a Newly-Dead.

215
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:10,650
Like pointless hope.

216
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,154
Give me the key.

217
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,979
I don't think he has it on him.

218
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:51,774
It must be somewhere here.

219
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:23,598
<i>Found it.</i>

220
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:35,860
Why are you so cruel?

221
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:38,821
-Who are you?
-What do you think? I'm Gyeon-U's…

222
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:42,992
I'm not his friend, exactly.

223
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:44,869
I'm a shaman.

224
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,331
So you gave him that.

225
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:49,374
I did not.

226
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,795
Keep it safe.

227
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:55,505
Don't let her take it from you.

228
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,174
Let's go outside.

229
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,343
We'll talk outside.

230
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:02,178
Why?

231
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:05,098
I'd rather stay here.

232
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:07,892
Fine.

233
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:09,602
Gyeon-U.

234
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:11,312
Will you wait outside?

235
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:14,482
I wonder.

236
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:16,985
What do you plan on saying…

237
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:23,157
that you can't let him hear?

238
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:26,828
It's just

239
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:29,247
some shaman stuff.

240
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:31,708
As fascinating as it sounds,

241
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:34,752
I want Newly-Dead to stay and listen.

242
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,883
Shall we cleanse them together
or will you burn them alone?

243
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,476
I'll just stay here.

244
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:53,563
You can talk.

245
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:54,897
It's fine.

246
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:01,029
Tormenting people must be your thing.

247
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:02,572
Not really.

248
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:06,075
I haven't really tormented people.

249
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:08,828
I control things that aren't people.

250
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:11,414
That's great.

251
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:16,961
I'm pretty good at controlling things
that aren't people too.

252
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:49,660
Gosh, how scary.

253
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:52,997
Sure, let's talk outside.

254
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:09,305
Will you stay standing there?

255
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:11,808
No.

256
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:14,852
But you are still standing there.

257
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:51,472
Are you out of your mind?

258
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:53,766
Why touch that tainted stuff
with your bare hand?

259
00:24:00,565 --> 00:24:01,482
It can't be.

260
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:02,817
No, right?

261
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:05,069
It can't be what I'm thinking…

262
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:08,156
No, you can't do that…

263
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,291
I get your contempt for Yeomhwa,

264
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:20,501
but you shouldn't counter a curse
with another curse.

265
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:22,211
Did you get
your patron deity's permission?

266
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:23,921
Did the General give you the green light?

267
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:26,924
He said he'll punish me.

268
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:28,176
That's only right!

269
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:32,054
You want to use his great power
for something so vulgar as a curse.

270
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:34,765
No wonder the General God's angry.

271
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:38,269
So I said I'd accept the punishment.

272
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:41,105
What?

273
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:42,940
The Japanese said

274
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:45,985
that you dig two graves
when you curse someone.

275
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:49,322
One for the cursed and one for you.

276
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:52,950
To dig a grave for Yeomhwa,
I must dig one for myself.

277
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:54,368
Isn't that right?

278
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:16,891
"To kill"?

279
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,311
TO KILL

280
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:34,242
<i>I was at the columbarium.</i>

281
00:25:35,952 --> 00:25:37,787
I took care
of the Ghoul-Making Amulet too.

282
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:41,749
I plan on doing my best
so Ms. Oh can cross over in peace,

283
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:45,253
so why don't you stop doing this?

284
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,463
Did you cause this fuss just to say that?

285
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,048
It's not "just that."

286
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:54,679
Humans are not like animals.
They feel emotions.

287
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:58,099
If you hit a mother,
only she will writhe in pain.

288
00:25:58,182 --> 00:26:00,434
But if you hit her kid in front of her,
they both suffer.

289
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:01,352
In fact,

290
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:02,853
the mother suffers more.

291
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:05,773
Emotional pain is worse
than any physical pain.

292
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:12,905
So what?

293
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:16,784
You hurt Gyeon-U to get to his grandmother
and then hurt her to get to him.

294
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:18,869
That's how you've been
tormenting them, right?

295
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:22,957
I bet you won't cleanse the photos anyway.
You're going to burn them, no?

296
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:30,464
Why do you think so?

297
00:26:30,548 --> 00:26:32,925
What shaman preparing a cleansing ritual

298
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,721
comes without cleansing water,
incense, or candles…

299
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,141
and only brings a lighter?

300
00:26:45,396 --> 00:26:46,814
Are you the only shaman?

301
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,400
I'm a shaman too.

302
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:53,279
Not bad.

303
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:56,699
Is what Seong-A said true?

304
00:26:58,075 --> 00:26:58,993
Were you

305
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:02,413
not going to cleanse the photos at all?

306
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,209
What do you think I'd have done?

307
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:36,989
If they must be burned, this is better.

308
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,533
I don't want
your dirty hands touching them.

309
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,418
If you insist,

310
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:51,128
I have no more business here.

311
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:53,798
I should go.

312
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:58,844
But Newly-Dead.

313
00:28:01,764 --> 00:28:03,391
Of all the people to ally with against me…

314
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:07,978
you chose the Miwol-dong Baby Shaman?

315
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,029
Your life…

316
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:20,574
It's truly pitiful.

317
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:34,880
Have you been calling Gyeon-U
Newly-Dead all this while?

318
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:40,511
That's what you call
the ghost of a person who died recently.

319
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:43,931
Gyeon-U's alive and well,
so why call him Newly-Dead?

320
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:45,433
Just why?

321
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:55,025
It's a curse.

322
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:45,409
Pray and beg.

323
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,786
Are you crazy?

324
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,246
Not to me.

325
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,748
To your original patron deity.

326
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:53,876
Did you think I wouldn't realize

327
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,003
you were serving an evil spirit
and not your patron deity?

328
00:29:57,463 --> 00:30:00,424
Even if you'd tried to cleanse the photos,
you would've failed.

329
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:02,968
I saw through you the moment
you called Gyeon-U Newly-Dead.

330
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:08,015
Just how much evil did you do?

331
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:10,643
Your spirit vessel is cracking.

332
00:30:25,241 --> 00:30:26,408
So what?

333
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:28,619
You must beg your patron deity.

334
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:30,663
Ask them to return to you.

335
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,915
A shaman can't serve evil spirits.

336
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,708
Shut your mouth!

337
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,212
Or it might get ripped open.

338
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:00,901
<i>What's the bottom line?</i>

339
00:31:00,985 --> 00:31:02,444
The shaman hovering around Gyeon-U

340
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:05,322
is deadly scary
but feeble in shamanic powers?

341
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,284
His 21 days are up in just 2 days.

342
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:09,535
<i>Why now?</i>

343
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:11,370
Don't worry. I'm here.

344
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:14,915
Starting tomorrow,
hug him whenever there's a ghost nearby.

345
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:17,918
You see the ghosts,
and I must do the physical touch.

346
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:19,169
Yeah.

347
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:22,423
We'll have to show some class teamwork.

348
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:25,676
<i>-Is Gyeon-U okay?</i>
-He'll be okay.

349
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:29,138
I'm handling things outside.

350
00:31:31,015 --> 00:31:32,975
And your robot friend
is guarding him inside.

351
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,936
That little punk. He's doing his part.

352
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:40,024
By the way,

353
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:42,026
why do I feel like something's off?

354
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:44,486
It feels like I forgot
something important.

355
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:46,363
<i>Like what? Think carefully.</i>

356
00:31:46,447 --> 00:31:47,531
I'LL KILL YOU, PYO JI-HO

357
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:50,534
Whatever. I must've messed up again.

358
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:51,952
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

359
00:32:07,176 --> 00:32:08,469
Two days.

360
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:14,183
We just need to get through two more days.

361
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,605
Once the 21 days are over,

362
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:23,609
you can stay away from shamans forever.

363
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:28,072
You'll be the same as everyone else…

364
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:32,326
and be at peace.

365
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:34,536
BAE GYEON-U! SAVE HIM! PROTECT HIM!

366
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:55,849
By burning the precious photos,

367
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,394
you saved your precious grandmother.

368
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:02,648
Ignore what she said. You're not weak.

369
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:03,691
You're strong enough.

370
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:10,239
Just hate me.

371
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:13,158
If I were you,

372
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:16,286
I'd hate shamans too.

373
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:20,791
I'm sorry.

374
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,134
<i>Telling someone to hate you…</i>

375
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:34,638
<i>hurts even if you don't mean it.</i>

376
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,410
You're the one who should hate me,

377
00:33:57,286 --> 00:33:58,287
you dummy.

378
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:30,110
This is it?

379
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:32,863
You thought

380
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:34,656
this could stop me?

381
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,180
Just one more.

382
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:01,433
If you kill one more person,

383
00:35:02,184 --> 00:35:04,019
you can ascend and become an evil deity.

384
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:10,275
Just one more.

385
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:12,444
If you kill

386
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:14,530
just one more person…

387
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:17,092
How's this?

388
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,470
Will this help

389
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:22,848
speed up the process?

390
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:28,103
Make haste and ascend.

391
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,523
Please come to me…

392
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:34,902
and be my patron deity.

393
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:07,142
Hey.

394
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:11,313
You disinfected your hand, right?

395
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:12,606
You can't let it get infected.

396
00:37:13,357 --> 00:37:14,191
Goodness.

397
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,944
I can take care of myself.

398
00:37:28,205 --> 00:37:29,873
Can I have a word?

399
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:32,000
You too.

400
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:35,420
Yes, you.

401
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:39,049
What about the presentation?

402
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:40,801
You two are the only ones
who have done nothing.

403
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:42,386
I'll do that now. I promise.

404
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:44,262
I'll get right to it.

405
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:45,263
Sorry.

406
00:37:45,347 --> 00:37:46,431
For today

407
00:37:46,974 --> 00:37:47,808
and for yesterday.

408
00:37:48,642 --> 00:37:51,395
If I hadn't said anything,
you'd apologize again tomorrow.

409
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:58,151
I have a question. What about Seong-A?
She didn't do it either.

410
00:37:58,610 --> 00:37:59,736
Yes, she did.

411
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,239
She did it really well too.

412
00:38:02,823 --> 00:38:05,909
Thanks. I heard you did
my share of work on the assignment.

413
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,330
Your shouldn't waste your precious time
on such stupid stuff.

414
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:14,292
So which of these photos
have ghosts in them?

415
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:23,844
This one.

416
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:26,763
And this one.

417
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:31,101
I knew this was an actual ghost.

418
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:32,728
No.

419
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,104
Not that one.

420
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:37,357
Here. The ghost is standing right here.

421
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:40,902
Here?

422
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,838
You're a truly mysterious species.

423
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:01,048
It's so cool.

424
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:07,637
There's not much time. How frustrating.

425
00:39:10,891 --> 00:39:11,850
You traitor.

426
00:39:19,775 --> 00:39:21,359
Move. You're in the way.

427
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:24,571
-Help me.
-What?

428
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:25,906
I want to take ghost photos.

429
00:39:27,491 --> 00:39:29,534
Ghost photos?

430
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:51,723
Here.

431
00:39:58,188 --> 00:39:59,106
Here.

432
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,275
Any pictures I take have ghosts in them.

433
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:05,821
What kind of ghost is this
that it's stuck to the floor like this?

434
00:40:08,949 --> 00:40:09,783
It's a dog.

435
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:13,620
A Dog Ghost.

436
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:35,851
What?

437
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:37,519
Good luck.

438
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,522
You know we're on different teams, right?

439
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:44,818
-I'm open.
-Over here!

440
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:46,653
-Come on. Here.
-Pass me the ball.

441
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:49,906
Hey, what on earth…

442
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:51,700
Now.

443
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:53,743
Now.

444
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,621
Sir!

445
00:40:56,705 --> 00:40:58,790
He's breaking the rules. Sir!

446
00:40:58,874 --> 00:41:00,041
Fairy.

447
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:03,879
-Oh, right. There's one.
-Hey!

448
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:06,006
-Here!
-And this one?

449
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:07,299
-Over here!
-There aren't any.

450
00:41:08,884 --> 00:41:10,343
Nice pass!

451
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:12,971
One animal.

452
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:18,018
-Pass me the ball!
-Two. One human and one animal.

453
00:41:31,031 --> 00:41:32,490
What's wrong with you?

454
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:35,493
Sorry. My bad.

455
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:52,302
<i>Sweet Bok-i. She's so cute.</i>

456
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:53,553
Hey, Fairy.

457
00:42:03,939 --> 00:42:04,773
What's wrong?

458
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:18,286
<i>Faceless Ghosts?</i>

459
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:20,163
SO-CALLED "EGG GHOSTS"
GHOSTS WITH NO EYES, NOSE, AND LIPS

460
00:42:37,973 --> 00:42:40,433
-Hey.
-Sir, he keeps playing foul.

461
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:42,936
-What are you doing?
-Class President.

462
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:44,437
I'm sick. I'm going home.

463
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:48,275
-What? That goes on your record.
-What's gotten into Park Seong-A?

464
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:49,776
What's up with her?

465
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,200
She didn't look unwell.

466
00:42:59,411 --> 00:43:00,704
<i>She didn't look well either.</i>

467
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:05,959
Take it. Seong-A has something to say.

468
00:43:06,543 --> 00:43:07,377
Seong-A?

469
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:11,881
Hey, it's me.

470
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:14,301
<i>Hey, Ji-ho. Make contact whenever you can.</i>

471
00:43:14,384 --> 00:43:15,927
<i>-Stay with him at all times.</i>
-What? Why?

472
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:22,100
Sure thing.

473
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:24,811
Don't worry and rest up. Bye.

474
00:43:27,814 --> 00:43:30,775
I knew it. Does she badly need my help?

475
00:43:30,859 --> 00:43:31,693
No.

476
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,778
It's not that. She's just…

477
00:43:34,571 --> 00:43:36,031
You look relaxed.

478
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:37,782
Do you have time to kill?

479
00:43:37,866 --> 00:43:40,910
She told me to work hard
for our presentation and not upset Hye-ri.

480
00:43:40,994 --> 00:43:43,204
But she's in a foul mood 24-7.

481
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:45,040
Seong-A wasted her breath.

482
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:45,957
You be quiet.

483
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:48,585
Can you finish your parts by today?

484
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:49,878
By today?

485
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:52,464
I have archery practice this evening.

486
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:54,299
Oh, do you?

487
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:56,134
Then you have until tomorrow morning.

488
00:43:56,718 --> 00:43:57,552
Pull an all-nighter.

489
00:43:58,970 --> 00:43:59,971
Pull an all-nighter?

490
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:03,183
-By ourselves?
-Yeah.

491
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:12,692
You're a genius, Hye-ri.

492
00:44:12,776 --> 00:44:14,402
I promise to pull an all-nighter.

493
00:44:17,364 --> 00:44:18,948
Let's stay up all night, friend.

494
00:44:20,033 --> 00:44:21,076
What's wrong with you?

495
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:26,956
He's so sweaty. Gross.

496
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:29,667
Your face is red.

497
00:44:30,377 --> 00:44:31,669
You look even uglier.

498
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:40,762
What was that?

499
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:58,279
Oh, my goodness. This is so…

500
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:01,658
There are Egg Ghosts everywhere.

501
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:03,076
It's so gross.

502
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:04,577
Egg Ghosts…

503
00:45:04,661 --> 00:45:07,580
I mean, Faceless Ghosts
are usually harmless.

504
00:45:07,664 --> 00:45:10,583
But not when there's
a whole group of them.

505
00:45:11,418 --> 00:45:14,838
It means they're expecting a master
to come and give them new faces soon.

506
00:45:15,797 --> 00:45:18,883
They'll be the first
to celebrate the birth of an evil deity.

507
00:45:19,676 --> 00:45:21,845
And it's obvious
who that evil deity will be.

508
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:23,888
It must be the one sealed up in the shack.

509
00:45:25,098 --> 00:45:26,933
Let's head there first.

510
00:45:29,102 --> 00:45:30,061
Okay.

511
00:45:31,813 --> 00:45:33,231
Jeez, I really don't want to go.

512
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:41,531
Yeomhwa.

513
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:44,993
You are well and truly out of your mind.

514
00:46:01,468 --> 00:46:02,302
First,

515
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:04,262
let's do what we can right now.

516
00:47:14,374 --> 00:47:16,251
How dare you act up, you weaklings?

517
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:17,961
You little…

518
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:19,546
I'll come for you!

519
00:47:19,629 --> 00:47:20,880
Gosh, you're so scary.

520
00:47:22,715 --> 00:47:23,675
What do we do now?

521
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:27,720
We should find that marionette's head.

522
00:47:28,304 --> 00:47:31,975
If we don't undo the spell on it,
ghosts will keep coming.

523
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:34,018
The head spreads the word
that an evil deity is on the way.

524
00:47:34,102 --> 00:47:36,771
She's right. We must find the head first.

525
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,898
All right. Let's find the head.

526
00:47:38,982 --> 00:47:39,816
By the way,

527
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:41,776
Heaven and Earth Fairy
seems more knowledgeable

528
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:44,195
about this area than you, my dear general.

529
00:47:44,279 --> 00:47:45,446
About the Ghoul-Making Amulet too.

530
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:47,699
I suppose you're feeling better

531
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:50,660
judging by how you're yapping again.

532
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:53,204
I'm just curious.
I'm bubbling with questions.

533
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:56,708
Like I said, I have questions.

534
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:57,959
Just go find the head.

535
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:01,462
Gyeon-U.

536
00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:02,505
What?

537
00:48:03,256 --> 00:48:04,882
My bow's weight is off.

538
00:48:05,675 --> 00:48:06,676
Take a look for me.

539
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:08,303
Let me see.

540
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:10,930
Stand over here.

541
00:48:11,014 --> 00:48:12,181
What feels off?

542
00:48:12,265 --> 00:48:13,266
I can't say.

543
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,059
Is the center off-kilter?

544
00:48:15,143 --> 00:48:16,144
A bit.

545
00:48:18,855 --> 00:48:19,689
Doesn't it feel off?

546
00:48:21,566 --> 00:48:22,734
Try drawing it.

547
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:30,408
-It feels okay.
-It's okay? Really?

548
00:48:31,868 --> 00:48:33,911
There's no way it's fine, though.

549
00:48:33,995 --> 00:48:36,581
-Was archery a touchy-feely sport?
-Are you sure it's not off?

550
00:48:36,664 --> 00:48:38,291
-You're weird. What's wrong?
-No, it's the bow.

551
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:39,208
-Well?
-Sir?

552
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:43,087
A motorcycle!

553
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:45,798
A bicycle!

554
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:47,216
Hey.

555
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:48,843
A cart!

556
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:50,178
Let go.

557
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:51,721
-Let go.
-Why are you so strong?

558
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:53,723
Watch out!

559
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:03,524
We live in a dangerous world.

560
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:04,734
Don't we, Gyeon-U?

561
00:49:06,778 --> 00:49:07,820
Seriously…

562
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:11,366
Gyeon-U!

563
00:49:12,408 --> 00:49:14,535
-Sir. Let me help you.
-Me too.

564
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:16,788
-One, two.
-One, two.

565
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,840
-Hey.
-What? Why?

566
00:49:29,092 --> 00:49:30,551
Forget it.

567
00:49:39,352 --> 00:49:40,269
About Seong-A.

568
00:49:40,353 --> 00:49:41,896
What? Seong-A?

569
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,022
What about her?

570
00:49:43,106 --> 00:49:44,482
Why ask about her all of a sudden?

571
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:50,405
It's nothing.

572
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:11,384
Is this it?

573
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:13,761
My gosh! This is it!

574
00:50:13,845 --> 00:50:15,596
It's disgusting! Yikes.

575
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,724
Bring it over so we can burn it.

576
00:50:35,992 --> 00:50:37,285
Burning won't do any good.

577
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:39,787
A rumor should be countered
with another rumor.

578
00:50:39,871 --> 00:50:41,706
The fastest way to get the ghosts to flee

579
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:43,624
is to make them think
the evil spirit won't ascend.

580
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:46,169
I get it, but doesn't that hurt?

581
00:50:46,252 --> 00:50:47,962
You sliced your hand as if it's nothing.

582
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,130
It hurts more if you hesitate.

583
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:51,215
I've done this when I was a kid.

584
00:51:06,522 --> 00:51:08,483
Good guy. Hang in there a little longer.

585
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:38,387
Come back to life,

586
00:51:38,471 --> 00:51:39,889
Gyeon-U Gyeon-U.

587
00:51:43,643 --> 00:51:44,894
Get out.

588
00:51:45,895 --> 00:51:46,813
Get out!

589
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:49,065
Okay, I'm getting out.

590
00:51:58,282 --> 00:51:59,492
Good night.

591
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:05,623
<i>I have a question.</i>

592
00:52:06,833 --> 00:52:07,750
Ask away.

593
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:12,547
Do you know the shaman you danced with?

594
00:52:14,257 --> 00:52:15,091
Are you two close?

595
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:19,804
She's Miwol-dong Baby Shaman.

596
00:52:21,264 --> 00:52:24,350
But that was the first time
I met her in person.

597
00:52:25,685 --> 00:52:27,436
She should live a good long life too.

598
00:52:28,104 --> 00:52:30,898
When she dies, she'll go to hell like me.

599
00:52:43,786 --> 00:52:45,288
MIWOL-DONG BABY SHAMAN

600
00:52:48,875 --> 00:52:50,626
<i>An eight-year-old baby shaman.</i>

601
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:52,962
<i>Seong-A starts her day</i>

602
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:56,090
<i>a little earlier</i>
<i>than other children her age.</i>

603
00:52:57,466 --> 00:53:01,554
DOCUSERIES THREE DAYS

604
00:53:06,851 --> 00:53:07,935
Roses are in bloom.

605
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:09,937
Right here.

606
00:53:10,021 --> 00:53:13,733
That's right.
My daughter got a rose tattoo there.

607
00:53:14,275 --> 00:53:15,151
She's with child.

608
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:16,360
What?

609
00:53:16,736 --> 00:53:18,321
But she's only 20 years old.

610
00:53:18,946 --> 00:53:20,698
As for who the father is,

611
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:22,408
she will never tell.

612
00:53:23,993 --> 00:53:26,829
Are you pregnant?

613
00:53:27,455 --> 00:53:29,332
<i>How do you know that, Mom?</i>

614
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:38,841
<i>Have you heard of Miwol-dong Baby Shaman?</i>

615
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:42,595
She was in a documentary ten years ago.
She was pretty famous.

616
00:53:43,638 --> 00:53:45,014
<i>That's me.</i>

617
00:53:45,848 --> 00:53:49,060
You won't make much with such small fries.

618
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:52,104
You can't even make
a proper Ghoul-Making Amulet?

619
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:11,499
Don't cry.

620
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:14,085
You shouldn't cry.

621
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:16,712
This is what makes Mom and Dad happy.

622
00:54:26,222 --> 00:54:27,932
<i>I won't see any ghosts.</i>

623
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:30,434
<i>I'll be a good girl.</i>

624
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:33,729
<i>Don't leave me.</i>

625
00:54:33,813 --> 00:54:37,024
<i>Please don't leave me.</i>

626
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:43,614
Kiddo.

627
00:54:44,824 --> 00:54:46,534
You're tempting the heaven's punishment.

628
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:52,081
<i>Why would you bring that up?</i>

629
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:57,878
I can share it nonchalantly
because it's not a big deal.

630
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:04,385
I first started school
as a middle schooler.

631
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:15,479
<i>Those who suffered</i>
<i>because of Miwol-dong Baby Shaman.</i>

632
00:55:15,563 --> 00:55:18,149
Justice lives, and it prevails.

633
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:20,317
-Do it quick.
-Did you think it was over?

634
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:25,614
WE HATE YOU,
MIWOL-DONG BABY SHAMAN PARK SEONG-A

635
00:55:28,576 --> 00:55:30,453
I never imagined this, honestly.

636
00:55:30,536 --> 00:55:31,746
TEACHING MIWOL-DONG BABY SHAMAN
A LESSON

637
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:36,375
<i>I got what I deserved, I guess.</i>

638
00:55:40,713 --> 00:55:41,630
The end.

639
00:55:42,298 --> 00:55:43,424
It's done.

640
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:59,231
Stop acting tough and get over here.

641
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:10,451
What are you both doing?

642
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:12,870
When kids don't cry
when they're supposed to,

643
00:56:13,788 --> 00:56:15,206
it breaks us adults' hearts.

644
00:56:17,917 --> 00:56:19,168
My heart's broken right now.

645
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:21,003
Don't be dramatic.

646
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:37,686
This is nice.

647
00:56:53,035 --> 00:56:54,286
Hey.

648
00:56:57,081 --> 00:56:58,666
When did you and Seong-A get close?

649
00:56:58,749 --> 00:56:59,875
We're not close.

650
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:14,473
Last year, when we were in 10th grade.

651
00:57:15,224 --> 00:57:18,602
Then you don't know
what she did before then?

652
00:57:18,686 --> 00:57:20,062
You were there when she explained.

653
00:57:20,146 --> 00:57:21,897
She didn't attend elementary
and middle school.

654
00:57:25,526 --> 00:57:27,611
Exactly how horrible have I been to her?

655
00:57:31,699 --> 00:57:33,242
Do you both think I'm stupid?

656
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:35,202
I've met so many shamans.

657
00:57:35,703 --> 00:57:38,914
You touch me because Seong-A told you to.

658
00:57:39,707 --> 00:57:41,542
It's what she used to do.

659
00:57:43,419 --> 00:57:46,338
You're right. You heard me say,
"Come back to life, Gyeon-U Gyeon-U."

660
00:57:46,422 --> 00:57:47,590
You'd be an idiot not to catch on.

661
00:57:50,176 --> 00:57:53,053
Do you believe it now
that Seong-A's trying to protect you?

662
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:55,931
Yeah.

663
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,561
Gyeon-U.

664
00:58:02,229 --> 00:58:04,940
Just you wait until tomorrow's over.

665
00:58:05,024 --> 00:58:06,901
You ungrateful little punk.

666
00:58:07,776 --> 00:58:09,403
What's so special about tomorrow?

667
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,991
You just need to know
that you've been a huge jerk.

668
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:17,411
See you tomorrow, Gyeon-U Gyeon-U.

669
00:58:36,388 --> 00:58:37,973
You don't get to call yourself a father!

670
00:58:38,057 --> 00:58:39,642
How dare you, you brat!

671
00:58:40,935 --> 00:58:42,228
You piece of shit.

672
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:46,523
You punk.

673
00:58:48,817 --> 00:58:49,985
<i>Jin-ung?</i>

674
00:58:51,237 --> 00:58:52,613
You're out of your mind, punk.

675
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:53,822
Bok-i.

676
00:58:53,906 --> 00:58:54,949
You idiot.

677
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:56,200
Bite him.

678
00:58:57,993 --> 00:58:59,828
-You can do it, Bok-i. Bite him.
-You little…

679
00:59:00,829 --> 00:59:02,081
Bite the man hard.

680
00:59:02,748 --> 00:59:03,791
Do it!

681
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:08,796
What was that?

682
00:59:09,505 --> 00:59:10,965
-Hey.
-Well done.

683
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:16,053
Seong-A.

684
00:59:19,682 --> 00:59:22,434
I didn't do anything, Gyeon-U.

685
00:59:22,518 --> 00:59:23,477
I really didn't.

686
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:25,437
What? I was just…

687
00:59:32,444 --> 00:59:34,863
Let's continue with the group work today.

688
00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:39,076
My gosh. You're awake for once, Seong-A.

689
00:59:40,995 --> 00:59:42,371
Jin-ung's not here?

690
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:44,540
-No.
-No.

691
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:47,626
Right, it's about time he went back
to his old ways, isn't it?

692
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:49,336
Let's get your desks into formation.

693
00:59:52,423 --> 00:59:54,383
So change your phone number and move.

694
00:59:56,302 --> 00:59:59,596
Mom. Don't call anyone, okay?

695
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:00,931
Especially not me. Okay?

696
01:00:03,726 --> 01:00:05,519
The bastard got out of prison!

697
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:08,522
If he finds you this time…

698
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:12,234
you'll die.

699
01:00:17,114 --> 01:00:18,866
I said I knew you well, didn't I?

700
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:22,411
Hey, you!

701
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:25,456
I won't beat you up. Stop right there!

702
01:00:55,694 --> 01:00:56,862
Kim Jin-ung!

703
01:00:58,405 --> 01:00:59,365
Hey!

704
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:07,623
Are you here, son?

705
01:01:10,626 --> 01:01:12,628
If I catch you, you're dead meat!

706
01:01:12,711 --> 01:01:13,921
Hey, son!

707
01:01:14,463 --> 01:01:17,007
Come out and talk to me.

708
01:01:41,115 --> 01:01:42,074
Kim Jin-ung!

709
01:02:02,636 --> 01:02:03,470
What's this?

710
01:02:04,138 --> 01:02:04,972
A ring?

711
01:02:18,986 --> 01:02:20,696
Let me summarize it one last time.

712
01:02:20,779 --> 01:02:24,074
We're covering
Kant's anthropocentric philosophy.

713
01:02:24,158 --> 01:02:25,659
What's the main idea again?

714
01:02:26,368 --> 01:02:28,912
It's all about putting people first.

715
01:02:28,996 --> 01:02:31,081
Humans are to be at the center,
not machines.

716
01:02:31,165 --> 01:02:33,667
It's not about money but about people.

717
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,252
People are precious beings,

718
01:02:35,335 --> 01:02:37,713
so they shouldn't be treated
as a means to an end.

719
01:02:37,796 --> 01:02:39,965
-Why?
-What?

720
01:02:40,048 --> 01:02:41,717
What do you mean, "why?"

721
01:02:44,011 --> 01:02:47,055
What aren't you getting
about not treating humans as a means?

722
01:02:47,139 --> 01:02:48,015
Sir.

723
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:49,892
I'll go and get Jin-ung.

724
01:02:50,601 --> 01:02:52,019
-Where…
-Hey.

725
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,612
Is Jin-ung in here?

726
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:04,114
Please help!

727
01:03:05,741 --> 01:03:07,826
-I can't go inside.
-Help!

728
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:09,870
Bok-i, I can't go in here.

729
01:03:11,205 --> 01:03:12,414
Help me!

730
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:16,668
Damn it.

731
01:03:16,752 --> 01:03:17,794
Help!

732
01:03:17,878 --> 01:03:19,379
I really shouldn't do this.

733
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:41,860
Lady Fairy went into the abandoned house.

734
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:45,614
Help…

735
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:51,912
Jin-ung, breathe.

736
01:03:51,995 --> 01:03:52,996
Jin-ung!

737
01:03:55,374 --> 01:03:57,668
Release him already!

738
01:03:57,751 --> 01:03:59,211
Stop it!

739
01:04:32,703 --> 01:04:34,204
Hello, Shaman.

740
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:44,756
Shouldn't you say hello back?

741
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:24,421
SPECIAL THANKS TO GWAG JA-HYEONG

742
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:27,132
<i>You should have let me die then and there.</i>

743
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:29,926
Gyeon-U!

744
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:32,137
<i>A person shouldn't do this</i>
<i>to another person.</i>

745
01:05:32,721 --> 01:05:36,266
I chose the last offering for you myself.

746
01:05:36,350 --> 01:05:38,894
<i>Shall I tell you</i>
<i>why your life is a living hell?</i>

747
01:05:38,977 --> 01:05:40,187
Come with me, you nutcase.

748
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:42,314
<i>Why is it Gyeon-U again?</i>

749
01:05:42,397 --> 01:05:43,315
<i>Because he's easy prey.</i>

750
01:05:43,398 --> 01:05:46,234
How much evil did you commit
that everything's so dark?

751
01:05:46,318 --> 01:05:48,362
I'll just kill you all!

752
01:05:48,445 --> 01:05:49,988
<i>Was I human?</i>

753
01:05:53,033 --> 01:05:54,159
<i>I found you.</i>

754
01:05:56,453 --> 01:05:59,456
