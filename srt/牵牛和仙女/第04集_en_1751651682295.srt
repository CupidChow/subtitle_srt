1
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:23,000
It's been five years since I started
studying for the civil service exam.

2
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,000
-You'll pass.
-Will I really?

3
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,510
Forget about that.

4
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,670
A man and a woman high-fived,
and then she clasped his hand by mistake.

5
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,590
They high-fived, then she did this.

6
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,760
But then

7
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,930
the man folded his fingers
over hers like this.

8
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,220
Doesn't this mean

9
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,430
the man's kind of interested in the woman?

10
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,390
I sacrificed myself
by working my fingers to the bone.

11
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,060
It must've been tough.

12
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:44,820
By the way,

13
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,820
if a man holds a woman's hand like this,
he's interested in her, right?

14
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,150
It was a bit like this.

15
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,780
Slow and gentle.

16
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,040
Clasping hands. Do it now.

17
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,120
It's nice, isn't it?
Do you feel butterflies?

18
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,870
Yes.

19
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,290
I knew it.

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,250
I was right.

21
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,630
You can't throw salt on her.

22
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:12,180
-She's your spirit-daughter.
-That brat.

23
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,580
I can't focus.

24
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,420
THE LATE OH OK-SUN

25
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,240
Hello, Ms. Oh Ok-sun.

26
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,710
Didn't you say
a really powerful evil spirit lived here?

27
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,630
I did.

28
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,470
Then why put up a straw rope
and scatter red clay?

29
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,470
This is what you do
when you host a powerful deity.

30
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:42,270
"Look over us, dear deity,
as we carry out a rite."

31
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,350
Aren't we groveling a bit too much?

32
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,560
It hurts my pride.

33
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,400
You're right.

34
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,940
We're not here to ask a favor of a ghost.

35
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,200
-Then what?
-We're asking a person.

36
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,950
A person? Who?

37
00:03:58,950 --> 00:03:59,780
Me.

38
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,120
"I can save them. I can make it right."

39
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,040
Words of affirmation for me.

40
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,750
This spirit is difficult to deal with.

41
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,090
I'm doing this because I'm nervous,

42
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,710
so quit talking and cooperate.

43
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,680
Mother.

44
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,640
You're an awfully cool shaman.

45
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,220
If I had been actually cool,
I'd have succeeded on my first try.

46
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,940
You haven't given up yet.
That means it's still your first try.

47
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,810
That's the mindset I'm trying to keep
while protecting Gyeon-U.

48
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,270
Even though everyone else says
he'll die in 21 days,

49
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,190
I won't ever give up.

50
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:39,910
Ta-da.

51
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,830
Today is already

52
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:43,950
the 13th day.

53
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,450
Just eight more days,

54
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,540
and Gyeon-U will be free
of his misfortune.

55
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,590
Even in this grave situation,

56
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,840
-he's all you think about?
-Yes.

57
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,050
I guess I'll become a real cool shaman
who's all about love.

58
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,060
Guys.

59
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:10,190
Gonjiam has nothing
on this abandoned house.

60
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,020
ABANDONED HOUSE TOUR

61
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,190
Brace yourselves.

62
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,690
Do you know who told me about the place?

63
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,070
The police.

64
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,240
Even they're too scared to go in here.

65
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,200
I'll protect him more thoroughly
for the remaining eight days.

66
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,540
Okay. Don't ever give in.

67
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,040
I won't give in.

68
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,630
As if you won't.

69
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,840
Can you beat this spirit?

70
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,260
Maybe not by myself.

71
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,090
You silly…

72
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,890
I won't let Gyeon-U come here.

73
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,430
He's safe as long as
he's kept away from evil spirits.

74
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,640
That's right.

75
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:51,980
That's what you must do.

76
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,770
What?

77
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,740
Avoid fights you can't win.

78
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,950
Tell a few lies and run away
when you have to.

79
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,200
Do everything you can to not lose.

80
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,580
Remember that.

81
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,500
You're the only one who can protect him.

82
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,670
Okay. I'll make sure to keep him safe.

83
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,250
Hey, the doors won't open.

84
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,170
Shoot.

85
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,470
Who are those fools?

86
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,840
I'm not lying, guys.
The door really won't open. Wait.

87
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,220
What are you doing?

88
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,640
That startled me.

89
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,020
What? You want to go in?

90
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,480
Don't. You'll never make it out.

91
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,270
Are you a shaman?

92
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,650
Guys, this is insane.
Real shamans are here!

93
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,860
Hey, give me that.

94
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,120
Stop fooling around and go home.

95
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,120
That's for me to decide.

96
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,700
I heard there's a real evil spirit here.

97
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,410
Are you here to take care of it?

98
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,330
I would've let you go in if I had.

99
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,840
If it were an ordinary ghost,
I would've let you go.

100
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,510
But I stopped you from going in
because you actually will die in there.

101
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:05,510
I can tell you're a typical bastard
who does things you're told not to.

102
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,680
But I stopped you

103
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,220
because even those bastards
have parents who'll mourn their deaths.

104
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,600
You're scaring us a bit too much, lady.

105
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,440
How about we go in together?

106
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,770
It's four against one.

107
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,030
It can't beat us four. I guarantee that.

108
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,610
Let's go inside together.

109
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,900
What do you think you're doing?

110
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:28,200
Come on and join us.
I'll let you into our field.

111
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,830
You look touched.

112
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,750
Hi, guys.

113
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,750
ABANDONED HOUSE TOUR

114
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,750
I have a sword.

115
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,670
This is great. Keep filming.

116
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,430
This is real.

117
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,100
Hey, dang.

118
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,180
Gosh, look at that.

119
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,890
Wow.

120
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,000
You made it look like a real sword.

121
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,250
Did you see that? I don't lose.

122
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,430
They're leaving.

123
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,640
They've left at last.

124
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,100
Took them long enough.

125
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,770
Don't throw shade at me, guys.
This is for real.

126
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,690
Let's go.

127
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,020
It's finally open.

128
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,690
Dang it.

129
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,240
Guys.

130
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,490
You heard what she said, right?

131
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,410
I risked my life to come in here.

132
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:58,750
Like, subscribe, and turn on notification.
I'd really appreciate it, guys.

133
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,210
What's this?

134
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,010
A ring?

135
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,060
What's the matter?

136
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,190
No pranks.

137
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,540
No!

138
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,590
Give something
with eyes, a nose, and lips

139
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,630
with the Human Amulet's scent on it
as a stand-in.

140
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,680
When the Human Amulet cannot be close,

141
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,390
the stand-in can still protect.

142
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,470
Shamans don't have anything
with eyes, a nose, and lips.

143
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,810
I didn't even play with stuffed dolls
as a kid in case they'd attract spirits.

144
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:12,070
Eyes, a nose, and lips?

145
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,990
Peekaboo.

146
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,580
How do I casually give him the lip balm?

147
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,670
Shall I call it
a symbol of our friendship?

148
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,630
No.

149
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,510
Who gives a used lip balm
as a symbol of friendship?

150
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,510
That's bullying.

151
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,140
The weather's lovely.

152
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,470
The weather?

153
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,390
That's it.

154
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,020
You can't let your guard down
because it's a nice day.

155
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,690
That's when you must make sure
to stay moisturized.

156
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,650
Do you know
what should be kept most moist?

157
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,110
Your lips.

158
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:52,950
My lips?

159
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,280
Yeah, your lips.

160
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,790
So…

161
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,670
if your lips become a desert,

162
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,630
then no life can breathe.

163
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,550
Here.

164
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,090
Let's stay moisturized.

165
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,390
What's up with her?

166
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,520
I don't know.

167
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,480
She's extra weird today.

168
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,940
This won't do.

169
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,110
Pinky.

170
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,120
It was you, Gyeon-U.

171
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,620
I thought it was Ji-ho.

172
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,500
Why did you think it was Ji-ho?

173
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,040
I'm a child at heart too.

174
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,790
Okay.

175
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,960
I'll keep that in mind.

176
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,690
The Baby Ghost.

177
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,740
A sleeping baby's an angel.

178
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,580
Even when it's become a ghost.

179
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,410
I'm glad the Wish-Granting Amulet worked.

180
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,660
It won't harm Gyeon-U.

181
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,920
Oh, my gosh.

182
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,540
I'm so sorry.

183
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:34,170
Are you grabbing him by the collar now?

184
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,300
It's fine.

185
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,630
The weather's lovely.

186
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,260
Wait up.

187
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,180
The weather?

188
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,270
What?

189
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,700
I'm hurt.

190
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,660
-Huh?
-What?

191
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,370
This is what's bad
about being in a group of three.

192
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,710
-I feel left out.
-What?

193
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,040
I pulled out a chair for you out of habit
because you'd always sit next to me.

194
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,920
But you ignored that completely
to sit next to Gyeon-U.

195
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,670
Isn't that too mean?

196
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,300
-Sorry for--
-That's it?

197
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,600
Get over here.

198
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,890
Don't focus on your new friend
and look out for your old friend too.

199
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,850
How childish. Are you a grade schooler?

200
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,810
I'm a kindergarten kid.

201
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,530
You'll do as he asked?

202
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:37,780
I must before he gets even more childish.

203
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,490
Hey, you…

204
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,740
This seat is for--

205
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,410
Let's eat together
until we finish the assessment.

206
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,830
-Whatever.
-What are you doing stood up? Sit down.

207
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,500
Okay.

208
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,090
-Sit somewhere else.
-Let's go.

209
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,550
Get moving, will you?

210
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,840
-Go eat somewhere else.
-Are they thugs?

211
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:03,590
Why tell them to move
when there are other seats?

212
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,430
-Group leader.
-Yes?

213
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,470
Our vice leader.

214
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,850
Is that a new kind of bullying?

215
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:11,850
Don't mind them.

216
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,690
Jin-ung bullies others all the time.

217
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,070
Today's lunch is awesome.

218
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,240
The soup's amazing.

219
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,740
It's incredibly good.

220
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:27,660
Eat up.

221
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,040
Do you want help?

222
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,830
So what?

223
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,540
Am I not supposed to care
about the assessment?

224
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,920
That's not what I mean, but…

225
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,800
So tell me.

226
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,550
What even are animal rights?

227
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:47,430
Why did you pick that as a topic
if you didn't know?

228
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:50,100
There's a reason
I need to know about animal rights.

229
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,140
What's that?

230
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,440
Why do you need to know that?

231
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,110
How cute.

232
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,200
What? Oh, dear, no.

233
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,280
That's not right at all.

234
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,740
What?

235
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,120
You said you liked Gyeon-U.

236
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,790
It was love at first sight.

237
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:15,710
Yeah.

238
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,050
I get that you like him.
He's handsome, he's a great archer,

239
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,130
and he's handsome.

240
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,800
You called him handsome twice.

241
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,470
That's how handsome he is,
so I get you liking him.

242
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,140
But Jin-ung…

243
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:35,190
-Just why do you think Jin-ung's cute?
-What?

244
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,560
You said earlier that Jin-ung was cute.

245
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,230
Me? When?

246
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,780
Give me a light.

247
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:42,860
You startled me.

248
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:47,950
How cute.

249
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:50,700
What?

250
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,160
You want a smoke too?

251
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:56,370
Here.

252
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,710
He's cute?

253
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,590
How?

254
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,710
No.

255
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,800
Okay.

256
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,430
Go ahead and pee.

257
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,510
Relieve yourself.

258
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,140
Why are you staring at me?

259
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,480
You want a piece of me?
Is that what you want?

260
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,270
I don't get it.

261
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,480
-Scared?
-What's up with him?

262
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:22,860
What's his problem?

263
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,440
Sir, they're smoking in the men's room.

264
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,280
Toss them.

265
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,660
Hey, it wasn't about Jin-ung.

266
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:30,740
Then what was it?

267
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,330
I was smiling at a dog.

268
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,740
Jin-ung's dog, Bok-i.

269
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:36,000
-A dog?
-Yeah.

270
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,460
-This dog?
-Yeah.

271
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,750
Jin-ung has a dog?

272
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,300
I thought Jin-ung was the dog.

273
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,800
She's always with him.
She must be his Guardian Spirit.

274
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,930
She's small but brave. She's really cute.

275
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:52,100
Oh, a Guardian Spirit? I thought you…

276
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,470
Bok-i's sweet and won't harm Gyeon-U.

277
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,060
But that's actually really hard.

278
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,560
Ordinary ghosts

279
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,230
get the urge to pick on and bother Gyeon-U
as soon as they see him.

280
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,520
Only those who had good discipline in life

281
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:06,400
or naturally sweet-tempered ones
can stay away from him.

282
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:09,240
Bok-i's like that.
She only cares about her owner.

283
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,490
That's fascinating.

284
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:14,450
Jin-ung may look harmful,

285
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,040
but to a shaman, he's okay.

286
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,750
The really dangerous person…

287
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,580
is Do-yeon.

288
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,340
-Ku Do-yeon?
-Yeah.

289
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,670
The Baby Ghost that's stuck to Do-yeon
is hard to deal with.

290
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,800
Do-yeon's haunted?

291
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,930
Quiet. She's a dangerous case,
so I took some precautions.

292
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,180
Didn't you feel anything weird?

293
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,100
You could feel suffocated
or get a headache around her.

294
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,480
I can't breathe.

295
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,020
My head hurts.

296
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,860
I feel nauseous.

297
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,820
I never noticed
because she was never nice anyway.

298
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:55,030
-But I feel just fine around her.
-I knew it.

299
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,910
I've always thought you have
a really strong qi.

300
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,750
-Is that good?
-Really good.

301
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,920
I wish Gyeon-U's qi were
half as tough as yours.

302
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,170
No, even a quarter would be nice.

303
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,430
Not Gyeon-U again.
It's always about Gyeon-U.

304
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:21,140
I can't help it. I'm just a girl in love.

305
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,150
They say love makes you look prettier.
What do you think?

306
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,060
Do I look pretty?

307
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,230
Well?

308
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:33,570
Can you be any more clueless?

309
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,950
I'm not pretty?

310
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,490
Gyeon-U's prettier, okay?

311
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,830
You're right.

312
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,540
I like Gyeon-U.

313
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,670
I miss him. I wonder what he's doing now.

314
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,340
I like Gyeon-U.

315
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,020
What should we do? They're unconscious.

316
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,230
They're both at death's door.

317
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,110
We must do a rite as soon as possible.

318
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,360
You said last time that it wouldn't work.

319
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,400
It won't work now either.

320
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,280
Remember the blind shaman?

321
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,200
She's bringing
some powerful shamans together.

322
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,410
I'll perform a cleansing rite
until they get here.

323
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,830
What?

324
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:26,830
I'm just trying to do whatever I can

325
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,750
before the young men die.

326
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,460
It'll be harder to deal with the spirit
if it takes more lives.

327
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,430
Oh, you're amazing.

328
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,720
Let go. Stop being clingy.

329
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:42,730
I warned them, but these damned idiots
still went in there.

330
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,610
INVESTIGATION UNDERWAY,
DO NOT ENTER

331
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,690
-Slowly.
-To the right.

332
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,030
Let's gather the leaves.

333
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:57,820
I thought their cleaning duty was done.

334
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,280
Why are they still at it?

335
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,240
No idea.

336
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,540
SPIRIT-MOTHER

337
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,420
Yes, hello?

338
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,210
Okay, got it.

339
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,210
Bye.

340
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:16,970
Sorry.

341
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,930
I have to dash to my part-time job.

342
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,100
-I'll walk you.
-I'll walk you.

343
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:23,020
No, I'd rather go on my own.

344
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,020
-Would you?
-Yeah.

345
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,690
Oh, right. One last touch
as the Human Amulet.

346
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,070
Gyeon-U. I'll see you tomorrow.

347
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,070
And you too.

348
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,280
Bye.

349
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,300
Let's bring in the two guys' souls
before the cleansing rite.

350
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:59,510
Yes, Mother.

351
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,840
A RITE FOR BRINGING IN WANDERING SOULS

352
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,100
-Let's go.
-Okay.

353
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,910
Gyeon-U. I'll see you tomorrow.

354
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,970
Hello, Newly-dead.

355
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,970
NEWLY-DEAD: NEWLY DECEASED SOUL

356
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,560
What are you doing here?

357
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,650
I'm here to see you.

358
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,650
How much longer

359
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,200
must I protect your family from you?

360
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,550
It's an amulet

361
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,180
that wards off evil.

362
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,180
It's familiar, isn't it?

363
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,390
You could've drawn it on my face only.

364
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,350
Why did you draw on Grandma's face too?

365
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,650
In case she doesn't cross over.

366
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,780
She was with you for such a long time.

367
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,950
Your father's quite worried

368
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,580
that you'll show up.

369
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,380
Close your eyes.

370
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:38,900
Here. Let's stay moisturized.

371
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:22,060
Is her part-time job very tiring?

372
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,110
Looks that way, right?

373
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:40,750
Existentialists can be
divided into two groups.

374
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,960
One is…

375
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,420
Seong-A, are you dead and gone?

376
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:45,960
Okay, sure.

377
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:46,920
I see.

378
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,590
Some existentialists believe in gods,

379
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,680
while others believe gods don't exist.

380
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,890
What's important is…

381
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,520
Jin-ung is practically forcing us
to eat ramyeon every day.

382
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,730
I want a proper meal.

383
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,600
I want a proper meal too.

384
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:04,480
U-TUBER FOUND UNCONSCIOUS

385
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,690
Isn't this our neighborhood?

386
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,860
What is it?

387
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,160
"These guys were found unconscious

388
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,740
at an abandoned house in Bongsu-dong
yesterday and made the news."

389
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:18,790
"They must be dead by now. Rest in peace."

390
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,660
I think it is our neighborhood.

391
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,420
Let's watch this. It looks fun.

392
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,170
-I don't want to.
-Let's watch together.

393
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,710
-Let's watch. It looks really--
-I said I don't want to!

394
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,670
Hey!

395
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:30,380
It's not about Water Ghosts. Let's watch.

396
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,630
No!

397
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,680
Coward.

398
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,260
Guys. Gonjiam has nothing

399
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,930
-on this abandoned house.
-Let's skip the boring intro.

400
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,390
Guys, this is insane.

401
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,310
Real shamans are here! Hey, give me that.

402
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,270
-Shaman? Why?
-Stop fooling around and go home.

403
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,860
That's for me to decide.

404
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,900
I heard there's a real evil spirit here.

405
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,280
Are you here to take care of it?

406
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,570
Hi, guys.

407
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,280
I have a sword.

408
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,240
This is real.

409
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,500
Seong-A, here's something incredible.

410
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,500
Wake up. You'll regret not watching this.

411
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:11,050
Come on. Quick!

412
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:11,970
What is it?

413
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,880
-This is about--
-This is real.

414
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:50,300
You…

415
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,460
Are you a shaman?

416
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,930
Why so serious?

417
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,810
What? It's nothing.

418
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,810
It's not nothing.

419
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:09,940
Maybe we should've woken her for lunch.

420
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,230
What?

421
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,740
Seong-A. Japchae was on the menu today.

422
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:21,370
Say it just once.

423
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:25,830
I can't.

424
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,040
Is it that hard to say?

425
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,710
"I have a sword."

426
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,510
"This is real."

427
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,220
Is that hard?

428
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,720
Well, it's…

429
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,760
It's not hard to say, but it's…

430
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:47,060
You try to laugh your way
out of everything.

431
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,310
If you keep this up,

432
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,020
I have no choice but to suspect
you're the shaman in the video.

433
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,320
You look just like her.

434
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,690
Am I wrong? Look.

435
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,650
-Don't they look alike?
-They do.

436
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,280
Hey, check out trending video
number eight. It looks just like her.

437
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,450
What are you doing?

438
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,370
Hey, do you want to watch it too?

439
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,450
Come over here.

440
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,750
Doesn't this shaman look like Seong-A?

441
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:09,290
U-Tubers had an incident
in an abandoned house nearby,

442
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:11,500
and two shamans who were there
got caught on camera.

443
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:14,050
One of them looks so much like

444
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,170
Seong-A here.

445
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,430
This person?

446
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:21,180
You can barely see her face.

447
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,760
It's really her.

448
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,770
Come on, I'm not that shaman.

449
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:29,440
So let's confirm

450
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,110
if you're her or not.

451
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,400
Here. Take this cutter.

452
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,530
Repeat after me.

453
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,830
"I have a sword."

454
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,630
I…

455
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:58,920
-have--
-Don't do it.

456
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:00,930
What? Why not?

457
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,800
Park Seong-A. Are you a shaman?

458
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:04,850
What?

459
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,390
No.

460
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:08,310
Then why are you doing as he says?

461
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,270
Maeng Ju-seung.
Do you know what a shaman is?

462
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,270
What?

463
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,980
Do you know
what you're running your mouth about?

464
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,400
-Hey, stop it.
-Answer me.

465
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,730
-What's wrong?
-Hey.

466
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,820
It would be nicer to ask
if she killed someone.

467
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,490
Murderers

468
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:26,370
get punished at least.

469
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:34,460
What's wrong with him?

470
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,340
Why is he so angry?

471
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:40,220
Are you okay?

472
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,640
Why did he get so worked up?

473
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,590
Hey, wait.

474
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,220
Let's talk.

475
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,850
You can't vent your anger like that.
You could've talked nicely.

476
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:50,770
"Nicely"?

477
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:53,020
How can I be nice
when the victim's standing there smiling?

478
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:56,860
I'm sorry.

479
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,280
I'll stand up for myself next time.

480
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,070
Apologize to yourself, not to me.

481
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:04,780
You just smile
when you're called a pick-me or a shaman.

482
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,780
You apologize first
when you did nothing wrong.

483
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,410
Shouldn't you feel bad for yourself?

484
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,500
Or are you

485
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,290
actually a shaman?

486
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,040
No.

487
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,880
Hey, why would she be a shaman?

488
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,720
Then why do you keep smiling?

489
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,800
Why do you do whatever they say

490
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,260
like they have something on you?

491
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:27,930
That's because…

492
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,940
I am a shaman!

493
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:37,610
-I really am a shaman.
-What?

494
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:42,030
I'm doing more than ten people's work

495
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,570
to keep you alive for 21 days.

496
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:46,620
I chased away a Water Ghost
and a Fire Ghost,

497
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,620
made myself into a Human Amulet,
and put Do-yeon's Baby Ghost to sleep.

498
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:51,790
I don't want to deceive you either.

499
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:54,790
What do I want to do with you?
Nothing but love.

500
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:57,380
Why are you so mean to me
when you don't know anything?

501
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,290
Hey, Bae Gyeon-U.

502
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,630
Say just one more thing,

503
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,880
and I will shut your mouth

504
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,550
with my lips.

505
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,060
I can't say that.

506
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,110
Forget it. Let's drop it.

507
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:26,360
Still,

508
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:31,790
it's shamans he hates, not me, right?

509
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:35,500
You're a pushover. Don't you hate him?

510
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,420
No.

511
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,250
I don't hate him.

512
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,880
I hate him a bit, though.

513
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,050
Gyeon-U.

514
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,140
Let's talk.

515
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,140
About what?

516
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,270
I don't know.
I need to start talking to know.

517
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:57,560
-Are you here to shoot?
-No.

518
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,060
Okay.

519
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,310
We are.

520
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:04,400
-What?
-Let's shoot some arrows.

521
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,320
-Hey, you…
-Will you?

522
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,120
It's heavier than it looks.

523
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,630
Put down the bow and stand
with your feet at shoulder width.

524
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,430
That's the square stance.

525
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,510
-Like this?
-Yeah.

526
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:32,800
Positioning must come first.

527
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:35,430
Before you look at the target,
check your current location.

528
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,890
See if the wind's strong or gentle.

529
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,020
If it's a good or bad spot.

530
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,860
You can't tell just by looking.
You must stand to know.

531
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,230
Okay. I'll feel it with my body.

532
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,000
This is a bad spot. Let's swap.

533
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:20,640
Is the bow defective?

534
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:22,690
You wanted to talk.

535
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,770
We'll get to that when I'm done.

536
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:39,410
Seong-A smiles like that
because I taught her to.

537
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,210
It was about a week after
we'd first started school.

538
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,010
I noticed this girl who couldn't eat

539
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,510
because she couldn't find a seat.

540
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,100
Smile.

541
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,480
Excuse me?

542
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,190
I'm in 10th grade, like you.

543
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,990
It helps to smile when you're intimidated.

544
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:16,370
Smiling makes you look relaxed, like me.

545
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:18,790
Okay.

546
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:23,370
Shouldn't you thank me?
I just told you a life hack.

547
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,380
Thanks.

548
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,340
What about the smile?

549
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:36,760
I said she just had to keep her cool.

550
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:40,350
That if she fakes confidence,
she'll actually be confident one day.

551
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,350
So don't be so harsh on her.

552
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,730
It's my fault, if you think about it.

553
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:52,650
That's what you wanted to tell me?

554
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,740
I have a crush on Seong-A.

555
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:00,030
If I grow to like her more,
I might play dirty.

556
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:03,830
I won't tell you things like this then.

557
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:06,920
You see,

558
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:10,590
I plan on cherishing the ones dear to me.

559
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:22,890
See? I said you had it in you.

560
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:25,390
-That was quite far.
-But he did it.

561
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,480
That's nothing.

562
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,020
This is his first try.
Come on, Gyeong-min.

563
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:33,780
SOJI: WHITE PAPER BURNED
TO CLEANSE THE IMPURITIES

564
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,280
Do you know what a shaman is?

565
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,700
It would be nicer to ask
if she killed someone.

566
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,990
Murderers

567
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:43,660
get punished at least.

568
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,120
Are you actually a shaman?

569
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,660
Then why do you keep smiling

570
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:47,870
like they have something on you?

571
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,560
-Gosh, that's hot.
-Oh, hot.

572
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:19,950
We should be cleansing the impurities
but we're just burning paper.

573
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,660
I know.

574
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:25,580
Our hands get burned,
but the impurities remain.

575
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:28,750
It's not working. Let's call it a night.

576
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,710
Yes, Mother.

577
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,130
Is something worrying you?

578
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,260
What about you?

579
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:41,640
I'm the same.

580
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,760
You're worried about your love.

581
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:45,890
Yes.

582
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,980
You know, Mother,

583
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,350
I'm envious of Spider-Man.

584
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,690
At least MJ doesn't hate spiders.

585
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,150
Gyeon-U…

586
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,950
hates shamans.

587
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,370
It's not just him.

588
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:06,620
Not many people like shamans.

589
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,080
Seeing ghosts isn't an enviable talent.

590
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,830
It's a divine punishment and our fate.

591
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:14,420
It's okay.

592
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,090
It's fine as long as
no one sees you like this.

593
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,840
Spider-Man?

594
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,090
He's only a spider
when he's wearing spandex.

595
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,800
He's usually an ordinary high-school kid.

596
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:28,930
What if,

597
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:31,140
and this is a big if.

598
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,650
What if I get caught?

599
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:34,610
Well,

600
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:37,150
worry about it when it happens.

601
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:46,580
Mother, shall I buy some Hanji paper?

602
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,700
-To burn more Soji tomorrow.
-Yes.

603
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,760
-Let's buy it tomorrow.
-Why?

604
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,720
Gyeon-U. He's behind us.

605
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,550
He is. Let's walk on.

606
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:10,180
Excuse me.

607
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:11,680
-What do we do?
-Excuse me.

608
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:13,020
-Don't talk. Run.
-Wait.

609
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,980
-Run.
-Aren't you the shamans in the video?

610
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,650
Just a moment. Wait.

611
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:20,360
Why ignore me when you heard me?

612
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:23,150
You, the mask on your face.

613
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,700
Can you take it off for a moment?

614
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,700
Who do you think you are?

615
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:34,000
You think you can boss
my spirit-daughter around?

616
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:36,540
Excuse me.

617
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,960
My friend was put in a tight spot
at school today

618
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:41,460
because people thought she was you.

619
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:46,090
I'm sorry, but can I take a photo of you?
I want them to stop suspecting her.

620
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,680
Please.

621
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,520
Okay.

622
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,770
-Thank you.
-"Okay"?

623
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,780
You'll take that off in front of him?

624
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,280
It's not okay.

625
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,370
I can't do it.

626
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,120
You heard her.

627
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:12,410
She can't show her face. Go away.

628
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,960
But she just said "okay."

629
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,790
That was a slip of the tongue.

630
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,040
Also,

631
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:19,710
your friend's problem
has nothing to do with my spirit-daughter.

632
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:20,840
That's her problem.

633
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,260
If you have time for this,
go tend to that friend.

634
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,470
How dare you ask for a photo?

635
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:27,930
Is she your friend?

636
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:33,850
You're very right.

637
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:37,230
But my friend's trouble

638
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,230
wasn't because of anything she did.

639
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:40,520
It was entirely on me.

640
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,320
I'll go and apologize to my friend, then.

641
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,700
Sorry.

642
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,910
Seong-A, sorry to text so late.

643
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:57,710
Can we meet up for a bit?

644
00:40:58,830 --> 00:40:59,920
I have something to say.

645
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,670
No. I want to apologize.

646
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:09,300
What are you looking at?

647
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:11,390
Eyes on the ground!

648
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:13,310
I should just…

649
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,030
Oh, no.

650
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,200
Oh, no.

651
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:37,330
I was afraid he'd find out, so I ended up…

652
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:40,500
Did you text him back?

653
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,250
How could I?

654
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:47,380
I told him, "Eyes on the ground."

655
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,260
Seong-A.

656
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:54,970
How's that?

657
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,140
Is it pretty?

658
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,690
Yes.

659
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,100
It's pretty.

660
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:16,370
It's pretty.

661
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:20,620
Why are we buying clothes out of the blue?

662
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:26,420
Think about it.

663
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:29,510
Spider-Man's only that
when he's wearing spandex.

664
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,340
Am I wrong?

665
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,470
Go on. Run to him.

666
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:41,310
I love you, Mother.

667
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,650
See you later.

668
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:13,720
Gyeon-U. Where are you?

669
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:17,470
I'm at Yuwol Park.

670
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,640
Where are you?

671
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:20,980
I'll be right there.

672
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:39,540
I found you.

673
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,120
Gyeon-U.

674
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:42,710
Seong-A.

675
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:46,630
I'm sorry. I was too mean earlier.

676
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:50,420
No, I'm sorry. I texted back too late.

677
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,130
No, it's all right.

678
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:54,510
That's nothing.

679
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,550
Right.

680
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,430
We're here, so it's fine.

681
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,770
Nothing else matters now, right?

682
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:19,660
The power's out.

683
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,420
It's dark.

684
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:32,920
Yeah.

685
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,590
Was it a long run?

686
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:41,260
Yeah.

687
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:45,230
We're lucky that it's a cool day.

688
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:48,020
Not too hot, not too cold.

689
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,070
Yeah.

690
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:00,700
But a power outage

691
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,660
isn't too bad every now and then.

692
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:07,420
It's nice and quiet.

693
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,760
No, is it spooky?

694
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:19,470
Darkness belongs to yin's domain.

695
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:23,760
The yin energy attracts ghosts.

696
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:29,770
I was scared of blackouts as a kid.

697
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:33,610
Why? Because it was dark?

698
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:35,230
Yeah.

699
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,110
I hated the dark.

700
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:39,910
I got so scared at night
that I slept with the lights on.

701
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:43,120
Do you know

702
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,660
that you feel calmer
when your hands are warm?

703
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:53,130
When I first met my mother,

704
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:55,420
she held my hand like this and said…

705
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,930
I may not be able to summon the morning,

706
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:03,550
but I can stay with you
like this until then.

707
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:07,270
Are you still afraid, child?

708
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:10,940
That's when I realized

709
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:14,360
how powerful a person's warmth is.

710
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,230
So?

711
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,450
It's not so spooky, is it?

712
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:32,710
To be honest,

713
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,130
I don't like it when you force a smile.

714
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:38,590
It reminds me of what I used to be like.

715
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:41,430
I kind of know what goes through your mind

716
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:43,430
when you smile like that.

717
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:11,410
Bad people

718
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,670
treat you worse if you smile.

719
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:16,420
They keep at it until you cry.

720
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:23,840
But you and I are two different people.

721
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,720
I projected myself onto you

722
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:30,470
and got angry.

723
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,190
I'm really sorry.

724
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,660
Don't think about the past now.

725
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,530
From now on,

726
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:49,030
nothing bad will ever happen.

727
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:51,200
Because I'll ward it all off.

728
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:54,540
I'm really warm.

729
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,050
Hi. Good morning.

730
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:50,300
Let's cycle to school today.

731
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:51,350
I don't have a bike.

732
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:53,350
I have lots.

733
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:58,900
Ta-da.

734
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:34,100
Hello!

735
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,180
Hi.

736
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:32,740
-Let's go.
-Okay.

737
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,140
Hurry, Gyeon-U.

738
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,100
My gosh.

739
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,980
What's he doing instead of archery?

740
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:03,480
Romance is in the air, I see.

741
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:09,860
What a freaky dream.

742
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,400
It's not a dream.

743
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:13,570
It's not a dream?

744
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:21,620
SERVING THE EAST SEA DRAGON KING,
FLOWER MASTER

745
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:23,580
So this wasn't
about the Heaven and Earth Fairy?

746
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:26,630
Every shaman knows what Yeomhwa is up to.

747
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:29,510
You didn't have to come
all the way to Yangyang.

748
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:31,300
You could ask any random shaman.

749
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,300
So, what is she up to?

750
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:35,930
You know, she does a lot of no good.

751
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,890
What kind of no good?

752
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:40,180
She seems to do anything for money.

753
00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:41,890
Why? Shall I ask her the specifics?

754
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:45,940
No, that's not necessary.

755
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,570
Hello? Yeomhwa?

756
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:51,860
Hey, Yeomhwa.

757
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,950
Tell her it's none of her business.

758
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:01,040
Hang up. I'm busy.

759
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:24,230
TO BLOCK

760
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,440
Shall we bike home from now on?

761
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,110
Riding home is a bit--

762
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:31,150
Yeah, twice a day is too much.

763
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:32,070
You're right.

764
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:34,320
No, it's not that.
I finish archery practice really late.

765
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,240
Archery?

766
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:38,780
Have you decided to go back into archery?

767
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:48,960
Let's chat after school.

768
00:52:52,590 --> 00:52:53,760
Come to the storage.

769
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:58,140
See you.

770
00:52:58,930 --> 00:52:59,760
See you.

771
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:02,470
You want a smoke too?

772
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,480
-Scared?
-What's up with him?

773
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:09,020
Sir, they're smoking in the men's room.

774
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,740
What's that about?

775
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:16,490
It's a long story.

776
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:18,360
I'll tell our homeroom teacher.

777
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:20,450
No. It's fine.

778
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:23,790
Are you sure you'll be okay?

779
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:25,450
Yes.

780
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:34,250
Because I won't be there.

781
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:40,680
Should we kill him?

782
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:46,600
Is he going to stay on?

783
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,100
Why does he keep coming?

784
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:49,690
-He even has a locker--
-Be quiet.

785
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:52,150
He's still in the middle of breaking up.

786
00:53:56,530 --> 00:53:57,490
What a Casanova.

787
00:53:58,070 --> 00:54:00,780
You're seeing another girl
before you break up with her?

788
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:02,450
Are you that disloyal?

789
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:04,200
Don't you feel bad for archery?

790
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:05,620
I don't.

791
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:07,660
Such a jerk.

792
00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:09,580
Because I won't quit.

793
00:54:11,170 --> 00:54:12,250
Archery, I mean.

794
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,970
Why's Mother so busy

795
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,300
when we have
such an important rite coming up?

796
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:27,850
She expects me to set up everything alone?

797
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:33,940
Come on, let's go.

798
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,070
Keep going.

799
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:38,530
Ghosts that appear in nightmares.

800
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:41,610
Murderer Ghosts so terrifying
even spirits would run away.

801
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:43,280
Hideous, bizarre, and freakish ghosts.

802
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:45,580
Cursed ghosts of those that buried
human remains in secret.

803
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:47,200
Ghosts of male and female shamans.

804
00:54:47,290 --> 00:54:49,410
Ghosts that followed funeral visitors.

805
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,790
Ghosts that rob people's wealth…

806
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:03,840
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

807
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:17,940
What's this?

808
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:27,370
Hello.

809
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:30,830
Hello.

810
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:33,290
Who are you?

811
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,290
Did you complete the cleansing rite?

812
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:40,130
Not yet, but we're almost there.

813
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:41,590
Who are you again?

814
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:48,010
Are you a shaman Great Aunt called?

815
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,020
I see.

816
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:55,100
Are you here alone?
Mother said a group would come.

817
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:58,520
Well, I got here a bit early.

818
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:00,780
I see.

819
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:04,570
What?

820
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:07,620
You were inside.

821
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:10,330
Did you manage to reason with the spirit?

822
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:11,580
I'd like to see too.

823
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:14,080
You can't yet.

824
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,000
Anyway,

825
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:18,960
let me see how well-prepared you are.

826
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:22,840
Why did you change your mind?

827
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:24,260
You didn't even tell me.

828
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:25,380
Because…

829
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:27,550
I like it.

830
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:29,890
You fool…

831
00:56:32,270 --> 00:56:33,350
For real?

832
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:35,440
Yes, you're this good at push and pull.

833
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,900
If you're not a born archer,
I don't know who is.

834
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:39,440
Kids, the hazing ritual. Go.

835
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,110
-Okay.
-Go what?

836
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:42,860
Our team has a hazing ritual

837
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:45,280
-that every new recruit has to go through.
-Don't fight it.

838
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,990
You know the abandoned house
that's supposedly haunted, right?

839
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:49,780
Go there and get back in an hour.

840
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:52,200
If you're late, you must run 50 laps.

841
00:56:52,290 --> 00:56:53,370
Are you ready, rookie?

842
00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:54,960
-But I--
-Ready, set,

843
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,080
go.

844
00:56:57,710 --> 00:56:59,920
You have an hour. Four, five.

845
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:01,840
Run!

846
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:22,360
I was wondering how pretty you are.

847
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:26,820
Okay.

848
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:28,740
Please give it back.

849
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:34,290
If you pull off the dance.

850
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:43,880
This is a dance for two.

851
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:48,130
I know.

852
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:27,190
Bad accidents were like fate.

853
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:29,150
They were always waiting for me.

854
00:59:29,230 --> 00:59:30,530
119

855
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:32,650
Grandma.

856
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:02,600
Lucky breaks were like a miracle.

857
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:05,020
They never happened to me.

858
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:16,070
A girl said she'd be there for me

859
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:18,870
until darkness gave way to light.

860
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:30,550
Her hands were so warm

861
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:34,720
that I thought I could be happy for once.

862
01:01:11,590 --> 01:01:12,960
But it turned out to be

863
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:15,050
an impossible dream.

864
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:52,500
You dared dance alone

865
01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:55,510
with that notorious Yeomhwa?
It's worse than smoking with an elder.

866
01:01:55,590 --> 01:01:57,260
You are a shaman after all.

867
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:59,180
-How dare you?
-For just five days starting tomorrow.

868
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:01,010
Stay friends with me
for just five more days.

869
01:02:01,090 --> 01:02:03,470
Of all the things you said to me so far,

870
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:05,060
how many of them weren't a lie?

871
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:07,560
I'll be much more unhappy
than you want me to be.

872
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,390
Seeing ghosts

873
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,270
isn't a skill or talent. It's a curse.

874
01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:13,980
I don't know you well,
but I know about shamans.

875
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:17,070
Can you let me off just this once?

876
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:19,320
The power of the Human Amulet

877
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:20,780
disappeared completely.

878
