1
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:13,616
Is the restroom a water park?

2
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:15,576
Why would you play with water in there?

3
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,244
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:17,328 --> 00:01:19,121
We weren't playing with water.

5
00:01:19,205 --> 00:01:22,124
Oh, should I say you played with fire
since you were smoking?

6
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:23,709
Why you little…

7
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:26,086
Cleaning duty for a week.

8
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,171
-Sir!
-What?

9
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:28,547
Should I make that two weeks?

10
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:30,508
-Sir!
-I did that last week already.

11
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:32,593
Come on, just let it slide this once.

12
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:33,552
Don't write us up.

13
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:36,222
-Darn you, Seong-a…
-Park Seong-a…

14
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,697
Don't come close. Talk from there.

15
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:58,118
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

16
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:05,209
You sneaking into the men's room
or you spraying water all over me?

17
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,627
Which one are you on about?

18
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,838
Both.

19
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:11,590
There was something in there,
so I was trying to remove it.

20
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:12,591
What was in there?

21
00:02:12,675 --> 00:02:14,301
A water gho…

22
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:17,555
A bug. A cockroach.

23
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:20,724
Yeah, there was a cockroach.

24
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:23,727
I hate bugs, so I had to kill it
when I saw one crawl in.

25
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,312
I was trying to get it…

26
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:27,815
And that happened.

27
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:31,485
Here's the thing.

28
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:34,113
I don't hate cockroaches that much.

29
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:37,741
At least they don't spray me with water
or get me in trouble.

30
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,286
In terms of danger,

31
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,246
you're far more harmful to me.

32
00:02:43,414 --> 00:02:45,583
So keep your distance
and don't come close.

33
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,835
-But I--
-Don't come.

34
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:07,479
At least you survived.

35
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:09,899
My…

36
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:11,066
first…

37
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:11,984
love.

38
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:19,283
I can't believe we have to clean
because of Seong-a.

39
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,605
Your video too?

40
00:03:58,072 --> 00:03:59,865
Are you trying to start a fire here?

41
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,628
-I'm not scared of you.
-Please be scared.

42
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,631
Shut up. I'm not scared of you.

43
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:17,883
How about now?

44
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:24,139
Jin-ung, I didn't see you there.

45
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:26,225
Hi.

46
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:28,978
You're saying hi to me now?

47
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,107
You know,
I wasn't talking to you just now.

48
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,901
Well…

49
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,197
I guess I was talking to you.

50
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:41,907
Hey.

51
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,909
You're acting up.

52
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:46,662
Know when to stop, okay?

53
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:47,955
I beat up women too.

54
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,457
Then I won't act up.

55
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:54,169
What does that mean anyway?
Acting like movie stars?

56
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,547
Do you know why I came here?

57
00:04:57,131 --> 00:05:00,968
I came here to clean this yard
on behalf of all three of you.

58
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,761
Do you get me?

59
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:05,848
Tell me, Kim Jin-ung.
Do you get how kind I was trying to be?

60
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,311
-I didn't know.
-Exactly!

61
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:13,147
You don't know anything.

62
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,858
Go on. Get going. Shoo!

63
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,860
Can you… All by yourself?

64
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:20,320
-Good luck.
-Okay.

65
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:22,156
-Do a good job.
-Don't you worry.

66
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,073
Thanks.

67
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:25,576
-Sweet.
-Shall we hit the snack bar?

68
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:29,788
That freaked me out.
I thought he might hit me for real.

69
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:30,998
What should we eat?

70
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:33,709
I'm going to eat ramyeon with sausage.
Let's hurry.

71
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,294
Bok-i?

72
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,048
I helped you because you're so cute.

73
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:43,802
What a weird girl.

74
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:01,487
BAE GYEON-U! SAVE HIM! PROTECT HIM!

75
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,822
That little Water Ghost…

76
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,044
Oh, so warm. I feel so much better now.

77
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,756
He thinks roaches are better than me,
but I saved him.

78
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,343
Misfortune doesn't strike only once.

79
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:27,346
It'll come at him every single day
during those 21 days.

80
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:28,806
That's not all.

81
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,851
He walked in here upside down, which means
he's weaker than anything out there.

82
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:35,562
You only managed to save the boy
bound for the afterlife just once.

83
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:37,523
It's not some grand feat to fuss over.

84
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:38,857
That's amateur behavior!

85
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:42,611
Can't you just compliment me?

86
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,279
You little…

87
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:49,368
So what's your plan going forward?

88
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:51,703
I don't know.

89
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,832
I used up ten amulets all at once,
so I'm out.

90
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:59,795
That Water Ghost was really powerful.

91
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,970
Don't jump in without a plan recklessly.

92
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,013
Take your time to come up with a new one.

93
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,811
Did you make these yourself?

94
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,020
For me?

95
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,774
Why would I do that
for such an incorrigible spirit-daughter?

96
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:23,443
I got them from an expert.

97
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,279
You know him too.

98
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:27,322
This…

99
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,826
This is exactly why
I didn't want to make amulets for her.

100
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:35,998
Mother.

101
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:38,458
Wait a minute.

102
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:42,963
Oh, dear.

103
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,715
I love you, Mother.

104
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,842
You're too old to do this.

105
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,761
Still, I love you to the moon and back.

106
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,641
Thank you.

107
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,812
You think I did what you asked, huh?

108
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,482
Brace yourselves for what is to come.

109
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,387
I'm just done sweeping, that's all.

110
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,751
That won't do.

111
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:04,628
Watch me closely.

112
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:12,719
Oh, my goodness.

113
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:14,930
Are you okay?

114
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:17,099
Yeah, I'm good. Continue.

115
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,768
Shake it off. Good luck.

116
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:21,728
That's insane.

117
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:26,149
Hey. That was awesome.

118
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,570
Have a seat.

119
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:33,615
Hurry up and sit down.

120
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:40,664
Gyeon-u's grandmother came by
to give some snacks to his new friends.

121
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,249
Give her a big hand.

122
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,211
Enough.

123
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:48,255
Taste good, Beom?

124
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,132
Yes. Aren't you buying us any drinks, sir?

125
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,634
I have to go now. Yup, that's it.

126
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:54,928
Hey. This rice cake is really good.

127
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,394
Be sure to clean up before you go.

128
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,104
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

129
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:16,283
You scared me.

130
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:19,703
-What are you doing?
-I thought you were Gyeon-u.

131
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,247
Oh, no. I can't do this.

132
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:23,540
Jeez, you coward.

133
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,459
Give me the amulet and his phone.

134
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,261
-Thank you.
-Excuse me.

135
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:41,558
Isn't that my grandson Gyeon-u's phone?

136
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,603
I painted those yellow flowers myself.

137
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:57,574
Rice cakes have always been a bribe.

138
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:00,369
Something's fishy.

139
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:01,620
Fishy?

140
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:04,998
It reeks.

141
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:07,667
-Something's shady.
-Shady?

142
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:09,795
Something's suspicious?

143
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:15,592
Why don't we look up
the newbie's Stargram account?

144
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,927
Okay.

145
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,303
BAE GYEON-U

146
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,722
JU-MONG BAE GYEON-U
TEN! TEN! TEN!

147
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:22,432
JOONGHYUN HIGH'S ACE
WHO IS BAE GYEON-U?

148
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:23,850
"The next national team member"?

149
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,186
What's a guy like him doing here?

150
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,691
You were so kind enough to find his phone,

151
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,568
and now you're walking me home too.

152
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:35,695
We're going in the same direction anyway.

153
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,663
Are you okay?

154
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:45,664
Yes.

155
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:47,082
I'm fine.

156
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,709
Grandma!

157
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:52,421
I'm sorry. I lost my phone.

158
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:56,049
They found it for you.

159
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:04,099
Something looks different.

160
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:06,768
You messed with it, didn't you?

161
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,646
With your phone? Why would we?

162
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,649
Right. Why would we?

163
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,651
What do you take us for?

164
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,363
He may think you would.

165
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:19,531
Hey.

166
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,452
You've already made new friends.

167
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:25,412
No, they're not my friends.

168
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,249
I want to be your friend.

169
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:34,087
Ma'am, I'd like to be friends
with Gyeon-u.

170
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:39,092
Most people don't go near the unfortunate.

171
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:41,845
They may offer charity,
but they won't eat with them.

172
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:44,848
Let's eat together.

173
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:47,434
Let's eat together and become friends.

174
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:53,398
What? Newbie used to be an archer?

175
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:55,400
A gold medalist? Unbelievable.

176
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:57,068
He's from Joonghyun High.

177
00:12:57,152 --> 00:13:00,363
He was a promising athlete
who won gold in every competition.

178
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:03,992
So why did someone like him
transfer to our school?

179
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,952
Our archery team is a cellar dweller.

180
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:08,205
-Maybe he was recruited.
-Right.

181
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,123
Do you really think so?

182
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,043
Ta-da.

183
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,085
THIS BASTARD IS AN ARSONIST

184
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:16,254
"This bastard is an arsonist."

185
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:18,840
"He was kicked out of the team
because he set the dorm on fire."

186
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:20,050
Is he crazy or what?

187
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,886
-He is insane.
-See? I was right to be suspicious, huh?

188
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:26,389
"I want to be friends with him,
so cook for us"?

189
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,266
Are you shameless?
Where's your conscience?

190
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:32,229
Besides, we didn't actually
find his phone for him.

191
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,605
Be quiet.

192
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,649
I have a plan.

193
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:45,325
Everyone gets to go home except me…

194
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,245
Wait.

195
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:50,789
It's you.

196
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,625
Am I right?

197
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:57,003
What do you say?

198
00:13:57,504 --> 00:14:00,298
You with a nice build.
You really aren't interested in archery?

199
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:03,051
Why are you doing this to me?
Please get a grip.

200
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:05,971
No, you're the one that should get a grip.

201
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,389
Your build…

202
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:09,724
Goodness, all this…

203
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:13,478
You shouldn't let it
go to waste like this.

204
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:14,521
But I will.

205
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,606
-It's a loss for the country.
-No, it isn't.

206
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,691
Why, you…

207
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:31,663
Gyeon-u's misfortune is so powerful
that one amulet isn't enough.

208
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:33,790
Amulets are more effective
when there are many

209
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,917
and especially if they're in a place
he stays long.

210
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:38,795
I get it now.
So you asked for a home-cooked meal

211
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,672
-to stash them at his place--
-Shush.

212
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:42,924
Keep Gyeon-u and his grandmother
away from home.

213
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:45,468
I'll go hide the amulets in the meantime.

214
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,050
Thanks for having me.

215
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:29,638
I said thanks for having me.

216
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,100
Please let me in.

217
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,701
Thank you for the invite.

218
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,916
Hey.

219
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:01,336
-Have a seat here.
-Okay.

220
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:05,090
Thanks.

221
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,300
By the way, where's your room?

222
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:11,012
Why?

223
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,765
I'm just curious.

224
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:14,933
Don't be.

225
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:18,311
You stay put right there
until Grandma returns with groceries.

226
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:21,064
-Why? I want to look around.
-No, don't move.

227
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:23,274
Sit down.

228
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:24,651
Stay seated.

229
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:25,568
Only on the cushion.

230
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:34,953
JINI BUTCHER SHOP

231
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,506
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

232
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,299
I'm sorry,

233
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,634
but I'm actually vegan.

234
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:51,219
I only eat plant-based food.

235
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,054
I can't eat meat.

236
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:54,472
Oh, really?

237
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:55,890
Yes.

238
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,476
So, why don't we get out of here?

239
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,747
What are you doing?

240
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:23,501
I'm sitting on the cushion.

241
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,674
Should I kick you out?

242
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:34,971
No.

243
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:40,810
This is for you.

244
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,358
Did you heat it up?

245
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:49,152
It's warm.

246
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:52,071
How sweet.

247
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:00,580
Don't drink it. Give it back.

248
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,207
But why?

249
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,458
Just do as I say.

250
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,835
-No, it's my water.
-Let go.

251
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:06,920
Hey.

252
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,174
But…

253
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:17,180
What is it?

254
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:19,390
Why?

255
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,105
You started it.

256
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:58,596
What?

257
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:00,932
Oh, my.

258
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:03,643
You must be hungry.
Let me whip something up quickly.

259
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,021
You spilled it.

260
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:09,232
It wasn't my fault. Don't kick me out.

261
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:10,692
What is it?

262
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,988
-What's with this weird vibe?
-What do you mean?

263
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:19,158
Why did you get
a bunch of rabbit food only?

264
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:22,996
I'm vegan now.

265
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:25,081
What?

266
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:28,334
Gee, you must be hungry.

267
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:31,713
Have your fill. I prepared plenty.

268
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:34,132
-Thank you for the meal.
-Thank you for the meal.

269
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:35,133
Here you go.

270
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:36,843
-Let's eat.
-Yes, ma'am.

271
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,348
-Here.
-You first, Grandma.

272
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,771
This is so good.

273
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,773
It's amazing, ma'am.

274
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,817
-This tastes wonderful.
-Thanks. Enjoy.

275
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,958
She raised you so well by herself.

276
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,585
Be good to her, dude.

277
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:16,591
What I meant is…

278
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:17,675
You know,

279
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:22,764
his parents are working overseas.

280
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:24,807
They left him with me,

281
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:28,019
and they're so busy with work
that they can't come by often.

282
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:30,271
But we keep in touch with them.

283
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:32,315
They call all the time too.

284
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,317
Right, Gyeon-u?

285
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,073
I'm sorry. I crossed the line.

286
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,450
Don't be. It's okay.

287
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:43,493
Hurry up and eat.

288
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:45,703
Eat up.

289
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:48,665
I'm an adoptee.

290
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,214
I haven't met my birth parents
for over a decade.

291
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:57,840
I live with my adoptive mother.

292
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,386
You could say she's good with knives,

293
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,388
but she is a terrible cook.

294
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:05,515
I can't cook anything edible either.

295
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:07,934
I've never had japchae this good.

296
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,690
It's so good.

297
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,611
I love it.

298
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:20,905
Gee.

299
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:24,158
Eat as much as you want. There's plenty.

300
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:26,536
Here. Feel free to have your fill.

301
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:30,081
Thank you. Yes! Thank you.

302
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,378
It's really good.

303
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,467
Seong-a, was it?

304
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:43,428
She's such a strong girl. Right?

305
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,892
Do I look like one?

306
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:56,399
I'm not sure if she's strong

307
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,568
or putting up an act.

308
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:13,166
-Let's talk.
-Huh?

309
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,674
What is it?

310
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:27,138
You were adopted?

311
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:30,975
Well, not on paper.

312
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:34,437
My birth parents left me with my mother
when I was eight and haven't returned.

313
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:41,569
Do people usually…

314
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:44,572
talk about such matters so nonchalantly?

315
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:48,034
I wouldn't know.
It's not a very usual matter, after all.

316
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:52,705
But it really isn't a big deal.

317
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:55,333
If it is, people talk
like Gyeon-u's grandmother just did.

318
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:58,920
They tell an obvious lie.

319
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,089
Ironically, it becomes more obvious.

320
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:03,382
That's how it is.

321
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:07,053
Put up a brave front, and they pity you.
If you seem sad, they look down on you.

322
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:09,806
If you hide the truth to avoid all that,

323
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:12,892
then it really becomes your weakness.

324
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:15,978
If it's not a big deal,

325
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:19,440
you must share it nonchalantly
to keep it from becoming a big deal.

326
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:31,869
BAE GYEON-U

327
00:23:31,953 --> 00:23:34,205
Isn't this Gyeon-u's room?

328
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,126
I think it is.

329
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:39,961
Well done, Ji-ho.

330
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:42,380
This is the last amulet.

331
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:45,049
Where should I hide it?

332
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:47,635
Oh, maybe in there.

333
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,680
Let me help you.

334
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:54,851
What was that?

335
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:13,578
I'm such an idiot.

336
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:14,954
That kid from earlier…

337
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:18,374
That was Gyeon-u, Bae Gyeon-u.

338

JOONGHYUN HIGH SCHOOL

339
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,961
-Look over here, Mr. Bae Gyeon-u.
-We'll take it now.

340
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:23,629
-Grandma, come here.
-Look here, too.

341
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:25,006
Let's take one together.

342
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:29,343
Here.

343
00:24:35,016 --> 00:24:36,767
-Good job.
-Thanks.

344
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:38,895
One, two, three.

NATIONAL SPORTS COMPETITION
MEN'S HIGH SCHOOL RECURVE, WINNER

348
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:55,286
So you're an archer?

349
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:56,996
You must be good.
Look at all these gold medals.

350
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:00,625
You're right.
Can we come watch you sometime?

351
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:02,835
I quit.

352
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,675
Going through other people's stuff
in their place…

353
00:25:10,468 --> 00:25:12,220
Isn't it out of line?

354
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:21,646
What's wrong? Are you hurt? Let me see.

355
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:25,441
No, I'm not hurt.

356
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,236
Seong-a's not hurt. I am.

357
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:31,530
-Hey.
-Hey, what's wrong?

358
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:35,076
Hey. What's wrong? Are you okay?

359
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:37,411
My feelings…

360
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:40,623
My feelings are severely hurt.

361
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:43,125
Oh, it hurts.

362
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:46,796
I'm sorry. I'm the one who made the mess.

363
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,965
Ji-ho did nothing wrong. I'll clean it up.

364
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,554
Hello?

365
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:57,932
Lady Fairy. Where are you?

366
00:25:58,015 --> 00:25:59,767
The clients are waiting.

367
00:26:00,935 --> 00:26:02,186
Oh, right.

368
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,437
All right.

369
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:08,776
Sorry, I have to go to my part-time job.

370
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:10,903
I'll clean this mess up another time.

371
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:12,863
I'm really sorry, but I'm late.

372
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:18,286
-Wait.
-Good night, ma'am.

373
00:26:20,538 --> 00:26:21,414
Oh, no.

374
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:24,834
She finishes late every night.
She can't come back here.

375
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,044
Whatever. That nutjob.

376
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:31,507
Wait.

377
00:26:33,134 --> 00:26:34,802
-Here.
-My purse.

378
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:35,720
Thank you.

379
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:36,679
Wait.

380
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:42,351
-Thank you, Heaven and Earth Fairy.
-You're welcome.

381
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:43,561
What?

382
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:46,105
Wait. How did you know?

383
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:48,733
I thought you were Gyeon-u.

384
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:50,484
Give me the amulet and his phone.

385
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:52,862
Thank you.

386
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,532
I'll save him.

387
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,534
I'll fend off all misfortune.

388
00:26:58,617 --> 00:26:59,994
I promise you

389
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:02,288
to free him from misfortune
after the next three weeks.

390
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:07,043
Let's talk more next time.

391
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:11,464
I'm on my way, ma'am.

392
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:18,346
What you saw today…

393
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:23,059
I won't care if you tell others about it
or gossip behind my back,

394
00:27:23,768 --> 00:27:25,603
but don't act like we're friends.

395
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:26,812
Tell Seong-a this too.

396
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:28,731
What do you mean?

397
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,192
I don't want to be your friend.

398
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:33,986
Is it because

399
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:35,821
we dropped all these?

400
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:37,156
It was an honest mistake--

401
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:38,866
Don't be mistaken.

402
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:40,993
I have nothing against you two.

403
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,496
I just don't like people.

404
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:51,003
You're a way bigger nutjob than Seong-a.

405
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:55,216
Bae Gyeon-u from Joonghyun High?

406
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:59,303
I'm sure he was kicked out.
His archery career is over.

407
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:15,820
Gyeon-u,
don't you want to apologize to me?

408
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:27,248
A gold medalist.

409
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:29,041
Every time he competed, he won gold.

410
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:31,377
That's why even though
he started the fire in the dorm,

411
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,254
they decided to transfer him
and cover it up.

412
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:35,005
They didn't even report it to the police.

413
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:39,635
Arson is a serious crime.
Is it okay to cover it up?

414
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:40,845
My point exactly.

415
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:43,764
Why send him to another school
when he should be in juvie?

416
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,516
To our class, at that.

417
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:47,768
What should we do, Beom?

418
00:28:47,852 --> 00:28:50,521
-I'm terrified.
-Stop it. You're heavy.

419
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:53,315
What's so funny this fine morning?

420
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,290
Seong-a.

421
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,208
Seong-a!

422
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:17,131
What's up?

423
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:19,717
Did Gyeon-u not say anything?

424
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:22,636
No, he didn't say a thing.

425
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,390
I said hi as soon as I saw him
this morning, but he didn't say it back.

426
00:29:27,725 --> 00:29:28,767
Even so, you're smiling?

427
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:36,400
Don't act like we're friends.
Tell Seong-a this too.

428
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,778
He doesn't want to be friends with us.

429
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:41,655
-He asked me to tell you this.
-What?

430
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:44,825
Why? What's the reason?

431
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:47,995
The newbie is an arsonist.

432
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:50,080
Stay away from him. Far away.

433
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:55,377
I wouldn't know.

434
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:57,588
Maybe he's just a troubled teenager.

435
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:13,437
Oh, right. Have you heard?

436
00:30:13,521 --> 00:30:14,730
The new student in Class Two.

437
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,690
-You know, the handsome one.
-Yeah?

438
00:30:16,774 --> 00:30:18,776
-I heard he's an arsonist.
-For real?

439
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:21,195
Yeah, he was forced to transfer here
after he started a fire.

440
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:23,113
What the heck? That's so scary.

441
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,260
-An arsonist?
-Don't look at him.

442
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:45,803
A new student who's an arsonist.

443
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:47,388
Don't look.

444
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:49,765
-Why would he start a fire?
-What?

445
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,226
Let's go.

446
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:56,063
Has he lost his mind?

447
00:30:56,564 --> 00:30:57,731
Why would he start a fire?

448
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:04,863
How annoying.

449
00:31:11,412 --> 00:31:13,205
You don't mind me sitting here, right?

450
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:14,999
Over here, Ji-ho.

451
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:20,337
This looks good.

452
00:31:21,589 --> 00:31:22,965
Hey, it's good.

453
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:25,217
I already told you
I don't want to be your friend.

454
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:27,011
Are you pitying me?

455
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:34,310
Did you not hear the rumors?

456
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:36,061
We did.

457
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:38,564
The meat is good.

458
00:31:41,025 --> 00:31:41,900
You're not eating?

459
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:45,154
Come on,
you need to eat meat to get taller.

460
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:48,073
You said no to a murderer
even if he was handsome.

461
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:49,783
Do you not mind other stuff?

462
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:53,037
Arsonists are a big no too.
They're just as dangerous.

463
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:54,663
Then?

464
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:59,376
Those cursed with misfortune always have
big accidents happening around them.

465
00:32:00,461 --> 00:32:03,547
All kinds of evil spirits
pounce on them to kill them.

466
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:06,800
I see more than others, remember?

467
00:32:06,884 --> 00:32:09,011
I believe in what I see, not some rumors.

468
00:32:10,304 --> 00:32:12,681
-What exactly did you see?
-That he is a good person.

469
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:15,934
He's the type to heat up water for you

470
00:32:16,018 --> 00:32:17,645
when that's all he had to offer.

471
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:19,480
To make it warm.

472
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,954
-I'm home.
-Welcome back.

473
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:38,999
Oh, something smells good.

474
00:32:41,377 --> 00:32:42,753
Why did you make so much?

475
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:46,465
To share it with a neighborhood friend.

476
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:48,717
You already made a friend
in this neighborhood?

477
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:51,845
She's so nice
that we hit it off immediately.

478
00:32:53,097 --> 00:32:54,056
I'll be back soon.

479
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:56,642
-Why don't I walk you there?
-Have dinner before it goes cold.

480
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:58,018
But…

481
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:24,753
I noticed how much you enjoyed japchae
the other day.

482
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:26,547
You're right. I love it.

483
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:29,758
Oh, my goodness.

484
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:32,970
-Take your time.
-You cannot go in there.

485
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:34,638
I just need to check something.

486
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:41,645
Gyeon-u.

487
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:50,154
What are you doing?

488
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:53,198
Now you're making her cook for you too?

489
00:33:53,282 --> 00:33:54,533
Wait.

490
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:58,078
What is it? Was scamming
and squeezing money out of us not enough?

491
00:33:58,162 --> 00:34:01,039
I get you're shameless,
but this is way out of line!

492
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:04,626
"Shameless"?

493
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,462
Gyeon-u, it's not like that.

494
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:09,423
-Let's get out of here.
-Wait, Gyeon-u. Oh, dear.

495
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:11,091
I'm so sorry.

496
00:34:11,175 --> 00:34:13,886
Gyeon-u. Hear me out.

497
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,596
It's not what you think.

498
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:24,938
Lady Fairy. Are you okay?

499
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:28,984
His temper has gotten worse.

500
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:32,196
Goodness, you must be shaken up.

501
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:34,531
Ma'am.

502
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:38,243
What's wrong with Gyeon-u?

503
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:42,623
I don't get it either.
His grandmother is such a gentle soul.

504
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:45,042
Who does he take after?

505
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:46,752
No.

506
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:49,630
That's not what I meant.

507
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:02,893
I think he'll burn to death this time.

508
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,104
Oh, dear.

509
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:10,484
Why are you always on the brink of death?

510
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:13,028
You handsome boy.

511
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:15,989
Gyeon-u. I'm sorry.

512
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:18,492
I'm really sorry.

513
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:21,161
I'm sorry I upset you, Gyeon-u.

514
00:35:23,372 --> 00:35:24,373
I'm sorry, Gyeon-u.

515
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:27,668
Why are you apologizing to me?

516
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:29,545
It's all because of me.

517
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,338
I'm at fault

518
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:34,633
for making you be at her beck and call!

519
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:46,144
I'm not mad at you.

520
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,189
I'm mad at myself.

521
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,944
You didn't do anything wrong.

522
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:01,118
Gyeon-u.

523
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:20,846
Don't trust anyone.

524
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:01,386
You're taking out the trash?
But it's only filled halfway.

525
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:04,723
I have to go sweep as a punishment anyway.

526
00:37:08,644 --> 00:37:09,895
He really scared me.

527
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:12,147
-He scared me so much.
-Wow.

528
00:37:12,773 --> 00:37:14,066
He wasn't leaving.

529
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:15,984
He was being forced out.

530
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:45,097
Where's Gyeon-u?

531
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:48,308
That's all you have to say to me?

532
00:37:48,392 --> 00:37:49,685
Hi. Where's Gyeon-u?

533
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,062
He went out to sort waste.

534
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:53,981
-To the storage?
-Yeah.

535
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:07,619
This shouldn't be here.

536
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:14,334
What's that smoke?

537
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:17,921
What's that?

538
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:19,506
Isn't that a fire?

539
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:22,926
-Where?
-Over there.

540
00:38:28,432 --> 00:38:31,018
Hello? This is Park Seong-a,
Gyeon-u's friend.

541
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:32,436
He can't answer right now--

542
00:38:33,854 --> 00:38:35,772
What was that? They hung up.

543
00:38:36,565 --> 00:38:37,941
Never mind.

544
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:50,328
"General Dongcheon

545
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:52,706
is the biggest dum-dum"?

546
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,678
GENERAL DONGCHEON IS THE BIGGEST DUM-DUM

547
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:07,929
Damn it.

548
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:11,349
Flower Master!

549
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:41,254
Help me!

550
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:43,048
Help me!

551
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,716
Please help me!

552
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,593
It's all because of me.

553
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:48,220
I'm sorry.

554
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:04,986
Get a grip.

555
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:06,947
I'm sorry, Hui-na.

556
00:40:07,948 --> 00:40:08,990
It's all because of me.

557
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,202
Hui-na, please.

558
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:15,997
Gyeon-u,
don't you want to apologize to me?

559
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:18,708
CHOI HUI-NA

560
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,670
I want to apologize to you.

561
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,342
I wish you would just die.

562
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:31,513
Okay. I will.

563
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:35,433
Gyeon-u. Bae Gyeon-u!

564
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:41,815
Gyeon-u. Bae Gyeon-u!

565
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,080
Gyeon-u.

566
00:40:57,164 --> 00:40:58,373
Go.

567
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,624
Don't come near me.

568
00:41:32,449 --> 00:41:34,159
Salt won't last us long.

569
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:35,869
-Gyeon-u.
-You leave.

570
00:41:36,453 --> 00:41:37,454
Gyeon-u, let's get…

571
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:14,426
Let's get out of here

572
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:16,261
together.

573
00:43:18,305 --> 00:43:19,681
ACCIDENT REPORT

574
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:21,725
Why does Gyeon-u
need to write an accident report?

575
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:24,894
What do you mean
he could've started the fire on purpose?

576
00:43:24,978 --> 00:43:27,188
That is why I'm asking him
to write up the report.

577
00:43:27,272 --> 00:43:29,149
I'm trying to find out
what exactly happened.

578
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:31,192
He's a victim who was trapped inside.

579
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:33,278
She's right. Gyeon-u almost died.

580
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:37,282
What could I do
when people keep voicing concerns?

581
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:39,909
They say it's because of the rumor
trailing after him.

582
00:43:39,993 --> 00:43:42,370
I need to find out
the exact circumstance--

583
00:43:42,454 --> 00:43:43,830
Circumstance?

584
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:46,958
The only circumstance I see is the one
where you're accusing him without proof.

585
00:43:47,042 --> 00:43:48,460
What more must we consider?

586
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:49,711
Why, you…

587
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,088
Have you always been this eloquent?

588
00:43:52,172 --> 00:43:54,215
It's refreshing to see you like this
instead of napping.

589
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:55,383
Sir.

590
00:43:55,467 --> 00:43:57,594
Stop badgering me and ask him directly.

591
00:43:57,677 --> 00:44:00,764
I asked him to explain
how the arsonist rumor came to be,

592
00:44:00,847 --> 00:44:03,058
but he said he'd write a report instead.

593
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,728
Don't accuse me of being a bad teacher.
He made the choice.

594
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:10,482
-But--
-Get going. I'm busy.

595
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:11,566
Go take a nap.

596
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:17,489
I'M SORRY…

597
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:20,283
TEACHERS' OFFICE

598
00:44:24,746 --> 00:44:26,998
Thank you for saving my life earlier.

599
00:44:27,082 --> 00:44:28,458
It was just an accident.

600
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:32,962
So why don't you explain it?
Why do you do as you're told?

601
00:44:33,046 --> 00:44:34,839
It makes it look like…

602
00:44:37,217 --> 00:44:38,718
you actually started the fire.

603
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:45,767
Do you have proof I didn't do it?

604
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:47,602
Do you?

605
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,063
I saw what happened.
Ji-ho, too. We both did.

606
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:51,356
You came to save me.

607
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:55,318
-I'm the only one who saw the fire start.
-Did anyone see you start it?

608
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:58,988
You said laughing about a bad thing
doesn't change it into a good thing.

609
00:44:59,072 --> 00:45:02,659
So you won't do anything about it?
How does that help?

610
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:04,619
Why act as if it's not your business?

611
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:05,912
What about you?

612
00:45:05,995 --> 00:45:08,081
Why are you meddling
as if it's your business?

613
00:45:08,164 --> 00:45:10,792
Are you so desperate
to help out a pitiful guy?

614
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:14,003
If you want to help anyone,
go to the restroom and look in the mirror.

615
00:45:14,087 --> 00:45:15,755
Do you know how pitiful your smile is?

616
00:45:27,851 --> 00:45:28,810
My point is…

617
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:32,981
stay away if you don't want to
end up more pitiful.

618
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:36,526
Who cares if I started the fire or not?

619
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:39,571
If everyone thinks I did, I did it.

620
00:45:54,461 --> 00:45:56,713
That slippery Fire Ghost.

621
00:45:57,547 --> 00:45:59,007
He's run off already.

622
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:02,594
You said you're depressed,
but you're getting your job done.

623
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:05,138
Why did they have to build the school
in this crappy place

624
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:06,973
and have ghosts acting out?

625
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:12,729
So, you're going to continue
with your "Saving Bae Gyeon-u" project?

626
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:17,859
I should, but I don't know.

627
00:46:19,027 --> 00:46:20,737
When I get one step closer,

628
00:46:22,071 --> 00:46:25,658
I want him to just take one step back,
but he takes about ten steps back.

629
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:27,619
It makes me feel terrible.

630
00:46:29,746 --> 00:46:30,872
That's understandable.

631
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:33,249
You went through so much
only to be told to get lost.

632
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:36,085
Come on, he didn't tell me to get lost.

633
00:46:36,169 --> 00:46:38,004
He just told me not to come close.

634
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:39,631
Same difference.

635
00:46:41,508 --> 00:46:45,637
Is it because of his misfortune?
He seems to mistreat others too.

636
00:46:49,057 --> 00:46:50,225
That wasn't funny.

637
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:52,101
You bet it was.

638
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:59,275
-Focus.
-Yes, sir.

639
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:01,402
-Release with confidence.
-Yes, sir.

640
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:03,196
Keep the anchoring arm close.

641
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:05,365
-Shoot as you always have.
-Yes, sir.

642
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:11,955
Gosh, here comes the star athlete.

643
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,832
To what do I owe this pleasure?

644
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:19,170
I got a call from Coach Jeong.

645
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:21,673
I won't join this team.

646
00:47:22,966 --> 00:47:24,300
You little punk.

647
00:47:24,384 --> 00:47:26,386
-I didn't even start talk--
-I won't.

648
00:47:42,652 --> 00:47:44,862
We're closed today.

649
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,580
We're not open today.

650
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,002
You're not a client.

651
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:01,045
Please come in.

652
00:48:01,713 --> 00:48:05,258
Gyeon-u won't open up to you, right?

653
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:07,635
It's not that he won't open up.

654
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:08,845
He's closed shut.

655
00:48:08,928 --> 00:48:10,722
He is like a deserted island

656
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:13,975
where anyone is forbidden to enter.

657
00:48:15,435 --> 00:48:16,603
You're right.

658
00:48:16,686 --> 00:48:18,271
It'll take a lot of effort

659
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,315
to make your way into his heart.

660
00:48:21,316 --> 00:48:25,486
Every time he built a bridge
connecting his island to the land,

661
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:27,572
people broke it mercilessly.

662
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:29,866
Even his own parents

663
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,869
don't want to be in touch with him.

664
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:38,791
Gyeon-u has been cursed with misfortune.

665
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:40,501
Since his birth.

666
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:44,255
"Die, little one."

667
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:46,716
That's what the world
seemed to be telling him

668
00:48:46,799 --> 00:48:49,093
as accidents struck him nonstop.

669
00:48:54,766 --> 00:48:55,600
Gyeon-u.

670
00:48:58,019 --> 00:48:58,936
Gyeon-u.

671
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:03,316
Gyeon-u, are you okay?

672
00:49:10,365 --> 00:49:14,911
We've tried every method out there
to free him from his darn misfortune.

673
00:49:15,495 --> 00:49:18,373
We've traveled all across the country

674
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:22,794
to see shamans and fortune-tellers
who made a name for themselves.

675
00:49:24,587 --> 00:49:26,214
That must've been rough.

676
00:49:28,216 --> 00:49:29,676
Oh, no.

677
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:31,886
It wasn't rough at all.

678
00:49:33,554 --> 00:49:37,308
He has always shown me
such a beautiful smile.

679
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:41,938
Even after facing
near-death experiences so many times,

680
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:44,023
he has never feared anything

681
00:49:44,816 --> 00:49:46,234
or gotten intimidated.

682
00:49:47,068 --> 00:49:50,321
His smile always reminded me of sunlight
falling on flowering trees in spring.

683
00:49:51,781 --> 00:49:53,074
It wasn't rough at all.

684
00:49:53,658 --> 00:49:55,410
He's kept my heart full.

685
00:50:01,374 --> 00:50:02,458
You'd think

686
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:06,295
that misfortune kills a person, right?

687
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:09,549
That's not true.

688
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,177
Being called names for being unlucky,

689
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:17,974
listening to parents yell at their kids
not to hang out with you,

690
00:50:18,808 --> 00:50:21,728
or having to endure
terrible people's nasty jokes

691
00:50:21,811 --> 00:50:23,646
about making bets on when you'll die…

692
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:28,276
If a living person
is treated like they're dead,

693
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:31,821
that person starts to fade away
from that point

694
00:50:32,739 --> 00:50:35,825
little by little.

695
00:50:37,452 --> 00:50:38,453
It's people…

696
00:50:39,746 --> 00:50:41,164
that kill another person.

697
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:44,459
Are you seriously giving up archery?

698
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:46,043
Yes.

699
00:50:46,127 --> 00:50:48,045
You must've heard of the Bae Gyeon-u jinx.

700
00:50:48,129 --> 00:50:49,338
I sure have.

701
00:50:49,422 --> 00:50:51,632
Major accidents happened
at every competition he attended.

702
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:54,677
A bus was overturned,
the ceiling broke down,

703
00:50:54,761 --> 00:50:56,554
and the athletes got food poisoning--

704
00:50:56,637 --> 00:50:58,222
He must be haunted or something.

705
00:50:58,306 --> 00:51:00,600
Bad things continue to happen around him.

706
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:02,769
But as you know, what is archery about?

707
00:51:02,852 --> 00:51:06,063
It's about keeping composure.
All those incidents got to the athletes.

708
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:08,900
My team isn't on top anymore.

709
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:11,694
Our ranking tanked after Gyeon-u joined.

710
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:15,114
Didn't Bae Gyeon-u win gold medals
every time he competed?

711
00:51:15,198 --> 00:51:17,867
Only Gyeon-u did well. Just him.

712
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:19,827
And that's worse.

713
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:21,579
Oh, I get it now.

714
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:24,832
So the jealous kids framed him for arson

715
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:27,126
-and you coaches looked the other way?
-No.

716
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:30,046
The one who identified him as the arsonist

717
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:32,715
-was Gyeon-u himself.
-What?

718
00:51:32,799 --> 00:51:34,926
He claimed the fire started
because of him.

719
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:38,304
He said that he didn't start it
but he was the cause of the fire.

720
00:51:39,514 --> 00:51:43,518
So, his teammates complained about him
not being punished despite his confession,

721
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:45,102
and the team spirit was trashed.

722
00:51:45,728 --> 00:51:47,146
What should the coach do?

723
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:49,232
I had to make a choice

724
00:51:49,941 --> 00:51:52,276
whether to side with Gyeon-u
or the other kids.

725
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:55,696
That's why I let go of Gyeon-u.

726
00:51:59,784 --> 00:52:01,494
Oh, my.

727
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:05,456
First of all, you…

728
00:52:06,249 --> 00:52:07,750
You'll never be Jesus.

729
00:52:07,834 --> 00:52:11,629
You abandoned the lost sheep
to save the other 99 sheep.

730
00:52:14,757 --> 00:52:16,592
That's fine. I'll take him in.

731
00:52:17,093 --> 00:52:20,054
Yours truly used to be
a children's Bible camp teacher.

732
00:52:21,264 --> 00:52:22,974
I'm an expert in taking in lost sheep.

733
00:52:24,267 --> 00:52:25,184
I'll get going.

734
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:27,770
Wait, Ju-seop.

735
00:52:27,854 --> 00:52:29,438
He really isn't easy.

736
00:52:30,398 --> 00:52:31,816
Do you think I'm easy?

737
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:35,111
Why did you pick up archery
in the first place?

738
00:52:36,571 --> 00:52:40,032
My grandmother liked me doing archery.

739
00:52:41,117 --> 00:52:42,994
See? Look at that.

740
00:52:43,703 --> 00:52:46,747
Then what's the problem?
Keep working on it.

741
00:52:46,831 --> 00:52:50,877
When you won gold in the last competition,
your grandmother was over the moon.

742
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:55,089
I didn't quit because I was an outcast.

743
00:52:56,632 --> 00:52:58,009
Give it enough time,

744
00:52:58,634 --> 00:53:01,095
and you get used to others disliking you.

745
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:05,516
Besides, I don't need anyone else
besides my grandmother.

746
00:53:07,602 --> 00:53:08,561
The thing is…

747
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:12,899
every time she comes to see me compete,

748
00:53:13,858 --> 00:53:16,694
she sees the others hating on me.

749
00:53:18,863 --> 00:53:20,948
No one needs to know all that.

750
00:53:21,032 --> 00:53:22,366
Having her see it…

751
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:25,703
I just can't stand it.

752
00:53:30,917 --> 00:53:31,876
Goodbye.

753
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:33,586
I won't see you again.

754
00:53:46,307 --> 00:53:47,725
My dear lost sheep.

755
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:50,144
You're so sweet and cute.

756
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:53,022
You're perfect for archery.

757
00:53:55,024 --> 00:53:56,192
My dear Gyeon-u.

758
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,111
My poor baby.

759
00:54:00,947 --> 00:54:02,782
I feel bad when I look into his eyes.

760
00:54:03,783 --> 00:54:07,119
I feel bad
when I look at his nose or his lips.

761
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,956
I feel bad when I hold his hands.

762
00:54:11,207 --> 00:54:13,626
I always feel bad for him.

763
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:20,091
It seems

764
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:23,427
saying you're sorry is your way
of saying you love him.

765
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:28,808
All those people

766
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:32,228
never apologize to Gyeon-u.

767
00:54:33,229 --> 00:54:34,814
Even when an apology is called for,

768
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:37,191
they never say they're sorry.

769
00:54:38,651 --> 00:54:42,947
Since no one apologizes to him,

770
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,950
Gyeon-u thinks that he's at fault.

771
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:48,744
He believes he's the bad apple.

772
00:54:51,038 --> 00:54:54,041
That's why I apologize to him instead.

773
00:54:56,711 --> 00:55:00,423
I'm trying to give him all the apologies

774
00:55:01,841 --> 00:55:05,011
the world has never given to him.

775
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:08,681
I remind him
that he didn't do anything wrong

776
00:55:09,724 --> 00:55:12,727
and that he isn't a bad person.

777
00:55:18,065 --> 00:55:19,358
But I still…

778
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:24,071
haven't told him
all that he needs to hear.

779
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:37,209
Lady Fairy.

780
00:55:38,711 --> 00:55:39,962
My Gyeon-u…

781
00:55:41,964 --> 00:55:44,091
is truly all alone now.

782
00:55:46,385 --> 00:55:47,386
Grandma.

783
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:48,471
119

784
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:51,682
Grandma.

785
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:57,730
Grandma.

786
00:56:00,566 --> 00:56:03,486
Oh, no. Grandma.

787
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:17,166
Just once…

788
00:56:18,918 --> 00:56:20,336
Just this once…

789
00:56:22,088 --> 00:56:26,050
Could you please go hold Gyeon-u's hand?

790
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:39,814
I passed on too quickly
that I didn't get the chance

791
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:43,317
to help him back up.

792
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:03,629
I'm sorry.

793
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:06,298
I realize…

794
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:09,593
I'm asking a lot.

795
00:57:11,971 --> 00:57:16,016
Ma'am, I think you're underestimating me.

796
00:57:17,977 --> 00:57:19,061
You see…

797
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:23,399
I'm not nice to someone just once.

798
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:27,736
Once I've decided to be nice to someone,
I'm always nice to them.

799
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,782
I won't change
even if there's a change of heart.

800
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:35,536
Just as gods don't abandon humans,

801
00:57:36,245 --> 00:57:38,581
just as moms don't abandon their children,

802
00:57:39,957 --> 00:57:41,292
I will continue

803
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:44,128
to be kind to him.

804
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:49,133
Gyeon-u…

805
00:57:53,762 --> 00:57:55,181
I will save his life.

806
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:29,798
Gyeon-u.

807
00:58:31,217 --> 00:58:32,927
It's quite dark there, isn't it?

808
00:58:35,346 --> 00:58:38,265
I know that the only star
in your life just fell.

809
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:43,187
I know that your world
has gone completely dark.

810
00:58:49,401 --> 00:58:51,904
FUNERAL HALL

811
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:00,329
I can't fathom
how difficult it'd be to imagine light

812
00:59:00,412 --> 00:59:02,039
when you're surrounded by darkness.

813
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:12,925
From this point onward,

814
00:59:13,801 --> 00:59:15,261
I'll keep reaching out to you.

815
00:59:18,138 --> 00:59:20,140
THE LATE OH OK-SUN
REST IN PEACE

816
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:49,295
I'm sorry that this is who I am,

817
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:51,922
someone you dislike.

818
00:59:56,427 --> 00:59:57,469
Wait.

819
01:00:01,015 --> 01:00:02,641
What are you doing?

820
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:04,852
How dare you show up here?

821
01:00:05,436 --> 01:00:08,022
What? Can I not be here?

822
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:10,649
Do you even hear yourself?

823
01:00:13,652 --> 01:00:14,486
Leave.

824
01:00:15,779 --> 01:00:17,323
Go on. Get out of here.

825
01:00:19,116 --> 01:00:21,452
Can't you hear me? Get out of here!

826
01:00:21,535 --> 01:00:23,078
Get lost!

827
01:00:25,331 --> 01:00:27,124
Even so, I will save you…

828
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:28,834
You little brat.

829
01:00:29,585 --> 01:00:31,170
…in the way you hate.

830
01:00:33,464 --> 01:00:35,174
Do you think I'm here for you?

831
01:00:35,257 --> 01:00:36,925
I'm here to see your grandmother.

832
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:40,554
I won't leave you alone.

833
01:01:18,717 --> 01:01:21,845
SPECIAL THANKS TO GIL HAE-YEON

834
01:01:22,346 --> 01:01:24,139
I heard your grandmother passed away.

835
01:01:24,223 --> 01:01:25,891
She's finally free from you.

836
01:01:25,974 --> 01:01:29,186
Must you defame her
even on her final journey?

837
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:30,187
I'm sorry

838
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:32,606
for being the source
of your unhappiness, Grandma.

839
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:35,192
I may not get him to understand,
but I can protect him.

840
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:37,945
If I have no choice but to be hated
by him, so be it.

841
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:40,030
I'll just focus on
what I can do right now.

842
01:01:40,114 --> 01:01:42,908
It's a surprise
that only three have died so far.

843
01:01:42,991 --> 01:01:44,618
Even ghosts die over there.

844
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:46,662
This is not a human being.

845
01:01:47,246 --> 01:01:48,914
It's a ghost in a shell of a human being.

846
01:01:48,997 --> 01:01:50,416
Hello.

847
