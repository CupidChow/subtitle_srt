1
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:15,576
Seong-ah, me

2
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:19,079
My eyes are wide open

3
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,961
In this order: ear, neck, mouth, nose
If you get stolen by a ghost

4
00:01:26,045 --> 00:01:27,463
What's going on?

5
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:33,469
'this'

6
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:36,722
When you hear the sound, you have faith.

7
00:01:36,806 --> 00:01:38,933
I believe in ghosts

8
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:43,020
'neck'

9
00:01:43,813 --> 00:01:46,106
I feel lonely when I see you

10
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,943
If you see a ghost then
I know everyone is a liar

11
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,779
Because no one believes me

12
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,159
So that's why I get lonely

13
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,203
huh

14
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:03,207
It's so lonely, I want to see a ghost
There are people who want to be friends

15
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,708
That won't do

16
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:07,670
Ghosts and humans
The reason I want to be friends is

17
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:09,129
Usually there's one

18
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:11,882
I want that body

19
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:16,428
What's on my face?

20
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,473
Huh? No

21
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:22,017
I saw it because it was pretty, because it was pretty

22
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:34,321
Coach, really
Do you know that you are a strange person?

23
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:36,824
- Why?
- no

24
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,785
Who would want an amateur like me?
Are you bringing me to such a big match?

25
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:41,662
Coach, aren't you scared?

26
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,372
I'm really nervous right now

27
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:45,916
This is full-on

28
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,002
Who told you to get a medal?

29
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:49,712
Do what you always do
What we did at school

30
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:51,964
I'm not doing anything

31
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,632
Just playing, at the archery range

32
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:55,134
So, do that

33
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:56,886
Playing with a bow next to Gyeonwu

34
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:58,429
You don't know?

35
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:01,140
Gyeonwoo that guy
I laugh sometimes while shooting an arrow, because of you

36
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:02,808
The kids who laugh have been doing it for a long time

37
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:04,351
I want to see him for a long time

38
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:13,569
Because of Gyeonwoo's grades
What I am using now…

39
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,279
- love you
- Buy me some beef.

40
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,405
Well, if Gyeonwu wins the gold medal

41
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:17,948
- call
- call

42
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:47,853
What are you doing, Inma?

43
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,785
I was hoping so

44
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:05,079
Baek Gyeon-woo who beat archery
I see it all here

45
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:10,042
Yeah, that's what happened

46
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:15,005
Hee-na, do you know?
You're doing archery again

47
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:17,591
Yeah, I know

48
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:19,760
He forgives you?

49
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,805
Heena

50
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:25,265
I'm going to Hanragi

51
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:27,768
I'm going to stop running away now

52
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:29,853
Gyeonwooya

53
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,897
I'm still the same

54
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:34,024
I wish you were dead

55
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,655
Don't get sick too much

56
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,243
You shouldn't do this to Heena

57
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:45,911
That's how Hee-na became like that
Whose fault is it all?

58
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:47,705
Hey, other people are watching, stop it

59
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,289
Hey, hey, no matter what, say it out loud

60
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:50,416
me too

61
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,418
I thought it was because of me?

62
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:57,131
So in his life
It completely disappeared

63
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,883
Still not happy at all

64
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:13,564
Who am I to make unhappy?
I'm not shooting a bow

65
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:16,567
I just do it because I like it

66
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:24,074
We are like this
Everyone, don't make it too complicated

67
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:26,410
Just each one
Can't I do what I like?

68
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,662
We all like archery.

69
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:47,181
The new spirit of the gods and the devils are the same
The mind of a thousand and one, the mind of a thousand and one, the mind of a thousand and one

70
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:49,558
Ceiling designation, sun and moon designation
Heaven and Earth, Hapgijeong, Ilwol, Hapgimyeong…

71
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:52,478
In these times
What is there to recite a harmony song?

72
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,987
Hey, open the door.

73
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,116
Ceiling designation, sun and moon designation
Heaven and Earth, Hapgijeong, Ilwol, Hapgimyeong…

74
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,037
Aunt, can I have the key to the prayer room?

75
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,960
Shin-Gwi-Hap-Gi-Hyung Lee-Sim-Hap-A-Sim
I know you…

76
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:19,046
What kind of nonsense is this?

77
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:26,929
Boys High School
The 70m record race begins

78
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,016
Gyeonwooya

79
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,102
If you're ready, let's go now.

80
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,115
Baek Gyeon-woo, fighting!

81
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,246
Come on, Gyeonwoo, you can do it

82
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:16,562
You're holding on so tightly?

83
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,105
then

84
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,482
I don't think it will work out

85
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,068
Because you are so warm

86
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,533
Now I will protect you

87
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,439
Oh, 2 points?

88
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:11,950
Right

89
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,290
Oh my, that's cool

90
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:25,339
Our Gyeonwoo has a handsome back of his head too

91
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,216
Pretty

92
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:42,314
The new spirit of the gods and the devils are the same
The mind of a thousand and one, the mind of a thousand and one, the mind of a thousand and one

93
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:46,652
The new spirit of the gods and the devils are the same
The mind of a thousand and one, the mind of a thousand and one, the mind of a thousand and one

94
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:50,781
The new spirit of the gods and the devils are the same
The mind of a thousand and one, the mind of a thousand and one, the mind of a thousand and one

95
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:55,911
The new spirit of the gods and the devils are the same
The mind of a thousand and one, the mind of a thousand and one, the mind of a thousand and one

96
00:08:55,994 --> 00:09:00,332
The new spirit of the gods and the devils are the same
The mind of a thousand and one, the mind of a thousand and one, the mind of a thousand and one

97
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,167
The new and improved Shin Gwi-hap-gi type is the same as the new…

98
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:04,836
Huh? This is…

99
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,004
Heaven and Earth, Hapgijeong, Ilwol, Hapgimyeong

100
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:09,383
Shin-Gwi-Hap-Gi-Hyung Lee-Sim-Hap-A-Sim
I know you…

101
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,121
It is easy for Bongsu to kill Gyeonwu

102
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,415
Are you blowing bad vibes?

103
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:42,666
But what should I do?

104
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,629
Today, with our method of suppression
Because it's a day to protect each other

105
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,631
To hit the cowherd

106
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,217
You have to win first

107
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:57,723
Ceiling designation, sun and moon designation
Heaven and Earth, Hapgijeong, Ilwol, Hapgimyeong

108
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:01,184
The new spirit of the gods and the devils are the same

109
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:04,980
The mind of a thousand and one, the mind of a thousand and one, the mind of a thousand and one
The wage rate law…

110
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,025
Look at this

111
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,165
Ceiling designation, sun and moon designation

112
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:26,084
- Ceiling designation, sun and moon designation
- Ilwolhapgimyeong Shinguihapgihyeong

113
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:27,461
I know this, I know this…

114
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:39,431
This is…

115
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:40,849
Thousand hearts, thousands hearts, thousands hearts

116
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,392
The new and improved Shin Gwi-hap-gi type is the same as the new…

117
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:43,602
Payroll Rate Regulation

118
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,539
If you don't shoot now, you'll be disqualified, Gyeonwoo.

119
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:06,083
Cowherd, Cowherd, I have to shoot

120
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,589
Shin-Gwi-Hap-Gi-Hyung Lee-Sim-Hap-A-Sim
I am so touched by the thought of the whole world

121
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:17,010
Speaking of archery, how does it feel when you do it?

122
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:20,514
Okay, no matter how hard the wind blows

123
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,809
You can win everything with one arrow

124
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,259
High School Boys Individual 1st Place

125
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:58,718
Baek Gyeon-woo

126
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:08,770
Great!

127
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:20,532
Congratulations, Gyeonwoo, you did a good job.

128
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,917
Great!

129
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:39,843
One, two, three

130
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,053
I'll laugh a little louder

131
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:43,889
- One, two, three
- Smile more?

132
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,309
Two, three, yes

133
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,189
Okay, okay, daily archery club member

134
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:54,274
Stick, stick, you too, I'll take a picture of you

135
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:56,485
Okay, go, hurry up

136
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,320
- thank you
- huh

137
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:01,406
Stick closer, stick closer

138
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,909
Okay, do what you have to do.
I'll take the picture myself

139
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,663
Okay, one, one, two, three

140
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:10,123
- Smile, please.
- Wait, wait, me too, me too

141
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:11,583
- uh?
- huh?

142
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:17,047
Kkilkippappa, Inma, do it moderately

143
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,340
Okay, one…

144
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,008
One, two, three

145
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,553
The picture is not as good as before

146
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,481
Let's go eat meat!

147
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,191
yes!

148
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:38,193
Hey, daily archery club member, you too, let's go

149
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,029
Oh, I have something to do at home

150
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,323
Teacher, I’ll go first today too…

151
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,075
Oh, oh, why!

152
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,618
Yeah, why? Let's go together!

153
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:47,994
I, it's not something else, it's that

154
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:51,039
Yogurt, yogurt
I want to show you something, grandma.

155
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:52,374
I thought you might like it

156
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,125
Sorry, sorry

157
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,336
oh my
I'm sorry about that then

158
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:57,337
I'm more sorry

159
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,421
I'm sorry

160
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,006
Have a nice day, Grandma

161
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,049
Will you come with me?

162
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,009
No, I'll go alone

163
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:04,094
okay

164
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:06,930
Hey, why are you so nice?

165
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,431
Buy me a lot of beef?

166
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:11,226
Even if you buy less
I plan to eat a lot

167
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:12,435
- huh
- let's go!

168
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,021
let's go!

169
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:20,318
You don't have to come today
I'll go alone

170
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:22,737
Yeah, I'm not following you

171
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:25,156
- It's okay if we're apart today.
- huh

172
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:27,617
however

173
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:31,413
Hey, Gyeonwoo, are you by any chance?
Is there anything uncomfortable or anything like that?

174
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,874
Oh, not at all

175
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,043
thank god

176
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,796
- you?
- uh?

177
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:45,802
I feel like I'm going to fly

178
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:49,139
That's fortunate

179
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:23,923
To ask for reconciliation from the other person
I tried the chemical formula

180
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,635
Instead, you get killed?

181
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:31,389
I drank alcohol and got fat again

182
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:33,016
What does this mean?

183
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:41,858
To be in harmony with you
It's a matter of life and death

184
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:49,032
Even while killing people on that side
I didn't want to get along

185
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:52,160
How about this?

186
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,705
Maybe because we have the same roots

187
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:57,916
It seems like we're getting along

188
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,174
Walk like that
Where would the temple be destroyed?

189
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:11,221
Step harder…

190
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:13,723
Why does it look like that?

191
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:14,849
It's nothing special

192
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,685
It's nothing special, I was cursed

193
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:19,312
What kind of kid is he?

194
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:21,648
Why are you harming the child!

195
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:26,319
Was it Seong-ah who was hit with the chemistry technique?

196
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:30,240
why?

197
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,660
Are you mad because I touched your new daughter?

198
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,829
I'm not even your biological child

199
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:38,415
If you're going to hate, then hate only me.

200
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,083
Is that possible?

201
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,253
If you hate people
The ring that person was wearing

202
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:45,505
The hat I often wore

203
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:48,049
The dog I raised and the neighborhood I live in

204
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,719
Neighbors who greet you in the neighborhood
Gather everything together

205
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:53,221
I want to throw it all in the trash can
Just people

206
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:55,348
How can you hate me

207
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,143
I can't

208
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,438
I hate everything

209
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:08,903
Keep doing that

210
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:11,781
Are you going to live in hell?

211
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:17,662
yes

212
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:21,791
grandma

213
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:26,838
I won a gold medal

214
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:29,966
The view is blocked

215
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,469
It wasn't very good

216
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,764
Still focused

217
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:38,224
"Go Oh Ok-soon"

218
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:52,238
Are you here?

219
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:58,036
okay

220
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,500
It's a headache

221
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:05,084
hey

222
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:10,131
Because of you
My head hurts so much, you know?

223
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:24,229
Hey, Mr.

224
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,439
I guess my eyes hurt now

225
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:29,609
Oh my

226
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,570
Why do you keep getting involved with me?

227
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:33,905
Avoid it

228
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:35,532
If you avoid it, what happens if you get hit?

229
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,868
Avoid that side or that side.

230
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:40,328
Without even winning

231
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,210
Baby

232
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:51,881
Playing with the baby
I'm getting a little bored now

233
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,386
What did you do well to raise your voice?

234
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:00,557
Hey, were you abandoned by your family?

235
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,144
I was just being used to make money
At a young age

236
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,105
- It's salt
- Oh, really

237
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:08,773
The goddess who gave me her body

238
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:12,235
It's the same thing as giving your body
Isn't that too much?

239
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:16,030
What are you talking about now?
Hey, you come out, let's go out

240
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:20,660
Aren't you a stranger to me?

241
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:24,163
I'm not a stranger to you

242
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:27,876
You're totally mine

243
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:31,754
You kicked me out and brought me here
It's you

244
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:35,717
Alone like me

245
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:37,802
Unhappy like me

246
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:40,930
You are cursed like me

247
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:42,473
Shut up!

248
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,439
Seong-ah, you are different

249
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:50,982
Raised differently

250
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:52,817
and

251
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:55,778
I'm going to raise you again from now on

252
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:58,239
With a heart that has been in my stomach for ten months

253
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:00,325
I will give it my all

254
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,620
I will never let you go now

255
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,795
Seong-ah, you got black water on your clothes?

256
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:14,297
yes

257
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:16,966
My spirits are clouded

258
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,593
I guess I'll get punished

259
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:22,347
That's what I'm talking about

260
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,515
That's me
Is there no way to receive it instead?

261
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:25,683
does not exist

262
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,770
If a non-shaman receives this, he or she will die.

263
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:32,357
Then, what about that suppression method?
Can you please break it for me?

264
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:36,945
Please close the door
Didn't I call you?

265
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,489
Well, that's true, but

266
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:42,116
Hey, Seong-ah, safety comes first.

267
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,035
That's more urgent

268
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:48,331
okay

269
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:50,959
see

270
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:54,170
It's a human amulet

271
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,547
Seong-ah gave it to you
There must be something

272
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:57,757
ah

273
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:02,053
Here it is

274
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:15,817
Is this true?

275
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,239
My mother took the place of the salt shaman
That you raised me

276
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:24,826
Enough to raise someone on behalf of someone else

277
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:28,997
Raising a child is like that
It's not an easy task.

278
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,627
It was strange, from the first time we met

279
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:38,089
I'm dancing on the flower bed

280
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:42,093
As we've seen before
It fit perfectly

281
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:44,804
That's it

282
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:48,141
It's a dance I learned from the same mother.
It has to be right

283
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:52,186
If you hit it like that

284
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:56,274
Me too
Could it get worse?

285
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:58,693
You may not believe it, but

286
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:02,321
He was such a kind and gentle person

287
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:04,365
So it is used a lot

288
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:05,950
I got hurt a lot too

289
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:10,371
The General's sore finger
There is a reason

290
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:13,624
however

291
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,502
No need to worry

292
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:21,174
Because there is someone who can correct me

293
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:25,845
Even if the stream takes a wrong path

294
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:30,433
If the sea holds on
No problem

295
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:36,731
yes

296
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:40,651
I can't break it, I give up

297
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:41,861
yes?

298
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:44,072
You two are too strong human amulets

299
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:47,158
The desire to protect each other
Because it's too strong

300
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:49,035
There is no room for other spells

301
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:50,870
No, then what?

302
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:53,748
Let's do it like this

303
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:58,669
Put this item in front of the Chilseongsin
I will give you my sincerity

304
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:02,423
The Seven Stars
He is the god who governs our life.

305
00:23:02,507 --> 00:23:04,092
You are the one who gave me my body

306
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:06,928
It's a human amulet.

307
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:10,556
Not only you
Seong-ah will also be protected at the same time.

308
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,017
Yes, then fine, please.

309
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:18,648
From now on, never
Don't get involved with ghosts.

310
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:22,985
First of all
You must not get involved with evil spirits.

311
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:26,656
Secondly, even if we get involved

312
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,825
Even if I die, I must not see blood.

313
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:32,161
When skin irritation occurs
I can't control the situation

314
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:35,623
Am I going to die?

315
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:37,500
I'm glad I died

316
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:41,712
It's like being unable to live or die
That's the problem

317
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:46,759
I think your body will be fine for the time being
Live carefully

318
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:49,762
By the protection of Chilseongnim

319
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:53,599
Until Youngcheong and Youngan are safely closed

320
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:54,851
Can you do it?

321
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,728
I'll try

322
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:25,798
hey

323
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:30,553
In my eyes, you are
It keeps looking weird

324
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,096
What did you do again?

325
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:35,808
Because my energy was mixed during the chemistry

326
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,440
why?

327
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:45,693
Do I look like a devil?

328
00:24:49,614 --> 00:24:51,324
A wooden box this size

329
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:54,911
Cover with white cloth so the lid doesn't open
I'm carrying a tied box.

330
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:58,080
Too bad, I have to look like a devil

331
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:38,663
Huh? He's a good brother.

332
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,832
- hello
- Shall I show you our baby?

333
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,835
- baby
- baby?

334
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:50,591
- You're cute, baby.
- Isn't it so cute?

335
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:55,721
Stupid idiot, stupid idiot, stupid idiot

336
00:25:56,973 --> 00:25:58,557
Surprise, surprise

337
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:01,602
Oh my, sir…

338
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,105
You were a human

339
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:06,399
Me, what are you saying to me?

340
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:08,651
No, no, no
That's not what I meant…

341
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:10,695
Hey, you, you?

342
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:14,740
Crazy, really

343
00:26:14,824 --> 00:26:16,075
You look like you have a lot of money

344
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:17,702
yes?

345
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:20,413
What are you drinking?

346
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:25,835
Huh? A normal person

347
00:26:37,138 --> 00:26:39,765
Hey, I need some pocket money, reply me

348
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:42,685
Answer, answer

349
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,895
Hurry up, won't you reply quickly? Reply

350
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:46,272
Reply, quick, answer

351
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:47,898
Wait until you get there

352
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:57,825
From now on, never
Don't get involved with ghosts.

353
00:26:57,908 --> 00:27:02,371
I think your body will be fine for the time being
Live carefully

354
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:34,278
Hey, Young and Handsome

355
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:36,197
- Are you coming now?
- yes

356
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:39,617
Handsome, listen carefully.

357
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,036
The fairies of heaven and earth
I'm going to get really sick soon

358
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,621
Take care of me from the side

359
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:48,334
Will it hurt a lot?

360
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:49,668
Yeah, I'm done

361
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:51,545
Shamans have something like that

362
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:53,964
Without even listening to the directions
Going to the hospital won't help

363
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:54,924
just

364
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:56,967
Something that has to happen for real

365
00:27:59,762 --> 00:28:01,972
That too, but he's now
Your heart is no joke either

366
00:28:02,056 --> 00:28:03,808
It's so rotten it's falling apart

367
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:07,520
What's wrong with your heart? What's wrong?

368
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:12,108
It's housework, oh, you don't have to know

369
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:13,401
Oh, yes

370
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:14,360
uh

371
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:20,533
By the way, looking at your handsome face
I hope it gets better

372
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:22,118
I don't know, me too

373
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:27,581
Don't worry too much
I'll try to do well

374
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:28,874
how?

375
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,670
With a pretty face?

376
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:35,339
It's really fun

377
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,106
Are you here?

378
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:56,527
huh

379
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,612
How are you, Grandma?

380
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:02,908
Yeah, I got along pretty well

381
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:31,812
But they say it's a human amulet
We're always together

382
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:33,397
Because it's far away

383
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:35,691
It's weird, isn't it?

384
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:36,859
huh

385
00:29:41,197 --> 00:29:44,533
The room looks really pretty
I've been thinking about this for a long time

386
00:29:44,617 --> 00:29:45,701
also…

387
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,161
So cute

388
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:50,831
Is this what you chose?

389
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:53,167
huh

390
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,426
You must have been busy

391
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,802
Studying is also a good thing

392
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:08,265
I worked hard…

393
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:10,267
No, that's not it

394
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,820
'Let's save Bae Gyeon-woo, let's rescue him'?

395
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:22,821
What is this? What is this?

396
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:28,410
Give it to me

397
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:29,495
no…

398
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:31,080
Why, why, why, why? What is this?

399
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:32,456
It's nothing

400
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,541
What is it?

401
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:35,209
Don't read

402
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:36,293
'Fire Ghost'

403
00:30:36,377 --> 00:30:38,003
- Don't read it
- 'Suicide Ghost'

404
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:39,880
Suicide is nothing?

405
00:30:39,964 --> 00:30:41,840
I told you not to read it!

406
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:48,013
If you tell me not to read it, then don't read it.
Why do you keep reading

407
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:49,348
no

408
00:30:49,974 --> 00:30:51,016
That's not it, no…

409
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,477
Seong-ah

410
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:00,359
Sorry, sorry

411
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:17,585
Seong-ah

412
00:31:20,254 --> 00:31:21,589
Are you still angry?

413
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:26,093
Sorry, I just did something

414
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:27,428
no

415
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:30,472
I'm sorry

416
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:37,813
But I wish you didn't know

417
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:42,443
A person must live within another person.

418
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:46,739
When it comes to ghosts
I'm going to live on the edge

419
00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:49,450
I am

420
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:53,329
You come with us quickly
I wish it didn't matter

421
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,914
I wish I could be normal

422
00:32:01,462 --> 00:32:02,630
I see

423
00:32:03,756 --> 00:32:07,051
If you knew you saw a ghost
How frustrating

424
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,136
I absolutely must not get caught

425
00:32:10,304 --> 00:32:11,263
okay

426
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:14,433
Don't worry too much

427
00:32:15,643 --> 00:32:16,810
No, that's not true

428
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:20,856
Seong-ah

429
00:32:26,362 --> 00:32:28,405
Seong-ah, are you okay?

430
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:44,380
Here we go again

431
00:32:45,506 --> 00:32:46,507
continue

432
00:32:47,383 --> 00:32:48,592
It keeps happening like this

433
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,682
Raise your arms like this too

434
00:32:54,765 --> 00:32:57,643
Hey, you minors!

435
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:08,320
you

436
00:33:08,404 --> 00:33:11,198
You I clearly
Didn't we just grow up holding hands?

437
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,202
Hey! You old shaman!
He keeps hitting me

438
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:16,954
That's not me!

439
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:18,414
hey!

440
00:33:23,961 --> 00:33:25,713
No, that's not it

441
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:27,756
I, I, I will explain…

442
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:32,052
Oh my, soles

443
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:37,808
Hey, why are you so late…

444
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:41,687
What's wrong, what's wrong, are you hurt?

445
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,772
Have you ever felt really wronged in your life?

446
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:45,274
I am like that now

447
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:47,651
My dream, my hope

448
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:50,863
Did you all receive it well?

449
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:54,658
What I want to achieve
What I want to be, my future hopes

450
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:57,453
Something like that, you can just write it roughly, okay?

451
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:59,121
I told you to just write roughly, what else can you say?

452
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:02,249
Conquer the Earth, Conquer the Space
Don't even think about using something like this

453
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:04,501
And 'I have no dream' too
No, you understand?

454
00:34:04,585 --> 00:34:05,419
- yes
- yes

455
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:06,962
If you don't know
Copy what the people next to you say

456
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:08,630
Okay, let's start

457
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:11,383
Give it to me

458
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:13,093
No matter what, it's still a dream

459
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,220
My dream?

460
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:28,442
Doctor, do you have a dream?

461
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:31,069
Will there be one? No, you don't have one either.

462
00:34:31,153 --> 00:34:31,987
There is

463
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,030
Butcher shop owner

464
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:41,038
Hey kid, you copied my dream? You want to be my partner?

465
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:44,458
- I'll do it, boss, call.
- Okay, okay?

466
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:56,261
Exactly

467
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:58,889
You're like a trivial thing, hey, uh

468
00:35:08,524 --> 00:35:09,817
Park Sung-ah, me and

469
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,109
I knew you would do that

470
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,737
Baekyeonwoo, you too

471
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:25,249
Okay, read on, both of you.

472
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:40,597
'My dream is to be a college student'

473
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:44,268
'There is no department I want to go to, but
'I definitely want to go to a 4-year university'

474
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:48,230
'High school graduation ceremony and
'I want to go to the university entrance ceremony'

475
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:53,360
'Holding a bouquet of flowers
'I want to take a commemorative photo'

476
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:55,654
But

477
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:57,072
What I want to do now

478
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:58,740
Graduation and admission?

479
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,161
Oh, the graduation ceremony and the entrance ceremony.

480
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:06,206
One of the two
Do I have to choose?

481
00:36:06,874 --> 00:36:08,417
Then it's graduation ceremony

482
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,712
I've been to several entrance ceremonies.
I've never been to a graduation ceremony

483
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:13,839
No, neither of them will work

484
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:15,966
Don't let time pass by and things happen on their own

485
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:18,927
It's something you can achieve if you work hard.
Write it again, okay?

486
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:21,638
That's something you can work on.

487
00:36:21,722 --> 00:36:22,598
Next cowherd

488
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:26,435
By trying hard?

489
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:27,978
I will do it…

490
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:31,481
My dream is…

491
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:39,948
I'll just write it next time

492
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:41,491
Okay, then, let's do that

493
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,493
Get in quickly, Inma

494
00:36:47,623 --> 00:36:49,416
Why here
Hasn't it been empty since a while ago?

495
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:50,626
Did you go to the bathroom?

496
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:51,627
I'm a common person

497
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:53,295
I haven't arrived at school yet

498
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:56,506
Oh, now even ordinary people are getting upset.

499
00:36:58,675 --> 00:36:59,968
Yeah, this is our class.

500
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:01,470
This is our class, right?

501
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,805
Hey, why aren't you announcing it?

502
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:05,682
What did you write?

503
00:37:06,642 --> 00:37:07,601
baby…

504
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:10,812
'adult'?

505
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:12,814
What, your dream is to be an adult?

506
00:37:13,357 --> 00:37:15,150
Oh, give it to me! I'll change it.

507
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:19,154
This is
It's not like you can get it just by trying

508
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,239
I want to change

509
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,001
How old is Bongsu?

510
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:34,461
Why that all of a sudden?

511
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,464
I thought they might be younger than us

512
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:40,592
Wow, that's a bit…

513
00:37:40,676 --> 00:37:42,427
Yeah, not really

514
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:45,472
Hey! You bastard!

515
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:48,308
Why are you so late? I wanted to see you.

516
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,230
Hey, are you in a lot of pain?

517
00:37:55,983 --> 00:37:57,025
Get some rest

518
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:58,443
What? You called me?

519
00:37:58,527 --> 00:38:01,613
- Why did he come late?
- I don't know either

520
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,118
Suicide ghost?

521
00:38:18,547 --> 00:38:20,298
Where the hell did he go?

522
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:24,302
I want to sprinkle some salt on it

523
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,018
- Gyeonwoo
- huh?

524
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:34,187
I have something urgent to do
Can you let go of my hand for a moment?

525
00:38:37,149 --> 00:38:37,983
No, no way

526
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,360
Huh? No way?

527
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:42,988
Yeah, no

528
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:45,824
I told you I would protect you

529
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:47,784
You have to catch it to keep it

530
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:55,500
Your face is red

531
00:38:58,086 --> 00:39:01,089
After hearing this
How come your face doesn't turn red

532
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:03,800
No, that's not it

533
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:08,221
I think you're sick

534
00:39:09,473 --> 00:39:10,348
Yeolna, now

535
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:13,477
uh?

536
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,023
I'm screwed

537
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:20,233
Is the war about to start?

538
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:28,950
A wooden box this size

539
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:31,787
Cover with white cloth so the lid doesn't open
I'm carrying a tied box.

540
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:35,415
With his divine power
I couldn't have seen anything stupid

541
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,222
crate?

542
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:51,765
A wooden box this size

543
00:39:54,518 --> 00:39:55,852
crate

544
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,439
Cover with white cloth so the lid doesn't open
I'm carrying a tied box

545
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:01,942
tied white cloth

546
00:40:03,944 --> 00:40:05,362
Wrapped in white cloth

547
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:10,033
Wooden box lined with white cloth

548
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,841
coffin?

549
00:40:56,538 --> 00:40:58,665
You want me to buy only one of the two?

550
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:01,042
You are too much

551
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:09,801
Why didn't you tell me?

552
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:18,018
Why didn't you tell me, why? Huh?

553
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:22,606
Why didn't you tell me? Why did you hide it?

554
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:35,160
Why, why did you hide it, why, why!

555
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:38,496
Why did you hide it, why! Why…

556
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,373
Why did you hide it

557
00:41:40,457 --> 00:41:42,626
Why did you hide it!

558
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,856
why!

559
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:09,194
Why, why didn't you tell me?

560
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:16,910
why…

561
00:42:21,498 --> 00:42:23,792
My baby, my baby

562
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:26,503
my baby

563
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:29,881
On my back, on my back

564
00:42:29,965 --> 00:42:32,509
I can't go and I'm in a coffin

565
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:35,720
Trapped in a coffin
Why didn't you tell me, Mom!

566
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:41,601
Why didn't you tell me?

567
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:44,729
why!

568
00:42:47,357 --> 00:42:48,984
Why did you hide it

569
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:50,610
Why didn't you tell me

570
00:42:53,405 --> 00:42:55,573
Why didn't you tell me, why

571
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:06,084
Salt!

572
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:08,628
-Why didn't you tell me, why
- It's salt

573
00:43:08,712 --> 00:43:10,922
- why!
- Chlorine!

574
00:43:11,006 --> 00:43:12,549
-Why are you saying…
- It's salt

575
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:14,426
-Why are you saying…
- It's salt

576
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:17,178
Why didn't you teach me? Why…

577
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:18,555
my baby

578
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:21,349
On my back, on my back…

579
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:28,148
Seong-ah

580
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:29,691
Let's just go home, okay?

581
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:32,360
Oh, no

582
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:35,196
If you don't practice archery even for a day
Your posture is messed up

583
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,114
I have to practice

584
00:43:37,324 --> 00:43:40,035
No, you're in so much pain
What kind of practice is this, let's go

585
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:45,123
Wait a minute, I'll go wash my face and come back.

586
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:46,249
huh

587
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:47,334
Oh, well…

588
00:43:58,053 --> 00:43:58,928
hey

589
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:01,848
What, were you excited yesterday because I wasn't there?

590
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,684
No, how much did you play?
The child is so sick

591
00:44:04,768 --> 00:44:07,312
It's not painful, it's just a war

592
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:09,898
Battle? What crime did the shaman commit?

593
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:11,524
I don't know either

594
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:15,320
don't worry
I will take good care of you

595
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:16,488
What do you care about?

596
00:44:17,364 --> 00:44:19,949
I'm right here next to you
You are in the mirror

597
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:35,006
Gyeonwooya

598
00:44:36,091 --> 00:44:37,092
Seong-ah

599
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:42,514
Look at him, he's not in good shape.

600
00:44:43,056 --> 00:44:45,308
Hey, I'm not Gyeonwoo

601
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,860
This won't work, let's go home, Seong-ah

602
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:15,797
If you commit a big sin, you will receive a big punishment.

603
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,843
Is my sickness a great punishment?

604
00:45:20,552 --> 00:45:23,138
Is it a great punishment for a loved one to be sick?

605
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:28,309
My loved one is sick
It's a much bigger penalty

606
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:29,310
so

607
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:32,522
The sky is for you

608
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:35,275
I'm blaming your child.

609
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,570
You're sick

610
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:42,574
The pain is as severe as the sins committed

611
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:48,663
I will curse you until I die

612
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:52,292
No, I'll curse you even after I die

613
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:56,713
I prayed all along

614
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,257
I beg you to forgive me

615
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:01,676
I'm gonna curse you

616
00:46:30,497 --> 00:46:31,414
Now you come?

617
00:46:32,499 --> 00:46:33,583
No need

618
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:37,462
Cursing me

619
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:42,008
I need to have my stuff
I'm not going to curse

620
00:46:43,176 --> 00:46:45,386
For 10 years
Because I never let it go for a single day

621
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:47,138
It will be delicious

622
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:57,857
Cheer up and do it

623
00:47:03,238 --> 00:47:04,072
I'll go and come back

624
00:47:07,951 --> 00:47:10,703
Stop, stop…

625
00:47:13,957 --> 00:47:15,959
Please stop

626
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:18,169
Stop it

627
00:47:20,255 --> 00:47:21,464
stop

628
00:47:22,549 --> 00:47:23,841
Did you break all the chocolate?

629
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:24,968
Do you have someone to give it to?

630
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:26,177
- Oh, not that one
- why?

631
00:47:26,261 --> 00:47:28,137
- Put strawberries in, strawberries
- Who are you going to give it to if you make it?

632
00:47:28,221 --> 00:47:29,055
It's a secret

633
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:31,307
No, no, no, no

634
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:33,309
He, strawberry, strawberry

635
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:39,232
- Hey, put half in, half in, half in
- Ah, then this is it…

636
00:47:43,236 --> 00:47:44,779
- I'll do it.
- huh?

637
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,656
- Take a break
- no…

638
00:47:58,126 --> 00:47:59,544
however

639
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:01,546
Will that fit here?

640
00:48:02,964 --> 00:48:03,840
Don't put it there

641
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:08,344
That box is not enough to contain my artistic soul.
Too small

642
00:48:13,308 --> 00:48:16,728
Bok-i really doesn't do what he's told

643
00:48:17,437 --> 00:48:19,397
I didn't listen to what people said

644
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:21,649
Because you look like me

645
00:48:23,151 --> 00:48:26,529
- Kim Jin-woong, are you crying now? Huh?
- Hey, hey, Jinwoong, why are you crying?

646
00:48:27,196 --> 00:48:29,198
Jinwoong, Jinwoong?

647
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:31,826
Doyeon saw me crying
I told you to stop, didn't I?

648
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:34,621
Doyeon is better than Bokki
I was born first

649
00:48:34,704 --> 00:48:35,997
I said it can't be reincarnation

650
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,665
What does that matter

651
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:41,669
I am Doyeon
It's important to cherish and love

652
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:45,465
I think you're really crazy

653
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:47,967
Oh! I'm crazy

654
00:48:48,885 --> 00:48:50,261
I'm crazy about Doyeon

655
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:55,099
- Hey, stop crying, okay?
- Hey, it's okay, it's okay.

656
00:48:55,183 --> 00:48:56,851
Is there anything else to break here? Huh?

657
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:58,269
I'll break it all

658
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:01,272
Hey, tear that crazy kid to pieces.

659
00:49:01,356 --> 00:49:02,273
okay

660
00:49:03,191 --> 00:49:04,651
I'm just like, huh?

661
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:06,527
I'll break it all

662
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:16,579
Wow, I thought it was a vibrating mixer.

663
00:49:18,915 --> 00:49:20,291
Could you please turn off your phone?

664
00:49:24,921 --> 00:49:25,922
Where are you going?

665
00:49:32,595 --> 00:49:35,223
Aren't you going to reply? You know after school?

666
00:49:35,807 --> 00:49:36,808
Come right after you're done

667
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:39,310
Come with a friend from today

668
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:41,145
A kid named Ju Seung

669
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,000
uh?

670
00:50:04,252 --> 00:50:05,420
Where did this go?

671
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,808
no
I don't like Beomsaeng much these days

672
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:20,393
What's going on?

673
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:22,854
Then just go to the teachers' office
Let me tell the teacher, okay?

674
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:24,897
I can't explain it, I have to do it

675
00:50:25,982 --> 00:50:28,067
You shouldn't get involved with ghosts.

676
00:50:32,488 --> 00:50:34,490
Seong-ah, Seong-ah
I don't think this is the place

677
00:50:34,574 --> 00:50:37,285
Let's just tell the teacher and go.

678
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:38,786
let's go

679
00:50:39,662 --> 00:50:40,538
Let's go, Seong-ah

680
00:50:41,873 --> 00:50:42,707
Sorry

681
00:50:45,585 --> 00:50:47,211
- what?
- Oh, sir

682
00:50:53,509 --> 00:50:56,929
Hey, Pan-Saeng-Ah, come out for a minute.
I know what you're thinking

683
00:50:57,013 --> 00:50:58,556
Open the door, huh?

684
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:05,229
uh?

685
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,941
Hey, open the door

686
00:51:09,025 --> 00:51:10,485
Seong-ah, let's go

687
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:12,236
wait for a sec

688
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,446
hey

689
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:16,449
He said he would take care of the shaman

690
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:18,659
Would it be okay if I left the suicide ghost alone?

691
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,036
Suicide ghost?

692
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:21,704
Pancreatic

693
00:51:22,705 --> 00:51:24,207
Don't think like that

694
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:27,335
That's not really what you think
Just now

695
00:51:28,753 --> 00:51:30,588
It's because it's so hard

696
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:33,674
Don't think like that, Gyeonwoo.

697
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:36,844
Grandma will be sad

698
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:39,180
When I see you like this

699
00:51:41,641 --> 00:51:42,517
It's my problem

700
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:45,603
Because of me, even Seung-i

701
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:48,815
As long as I'm not there, it's fine

702
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:52,777
Sorry

703
00:51:54,987 --> 00:51:56,989
Because I am my grandmother's misfortune

704
00:51:59,242 --> 00:52:00,743
- It won't work, Seong-ah.
- huh?

705
00:52:01,327 --> 00:52:02,745
- Hold on tight, okay?
- uh?

706
00:52:14,382 --> 00:52:16,050
Hey, you idiot!

707
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:18,803
Put it down

708
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:19,846
Hey guys

709
00:52:22,265 --> 00:52:24,058
- sorry
- no!

710
00:52:24,934 --> 00:52:26,185
Let go of this!

711
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:42,827
In this order: ear, neck, mouth, nose
Being eaten by ghosts

712
00:52:43,411 --> 00:52:45,496
Youngseol, sharing a mouth

713
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:47,290
Why is this happening?

714
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:49,500
I can't hear my voice

715
00:52:49,584 --> 00:52:52,670
Youngbi, I can even smell the ghost

716
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:55,631
Is that the smell of incense?

717
00:52:55,715 --> 00:52:57,717
Even if we get involved

718
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,052
Even if I die, I must not see blood.

719
00:53:00,136 --> 00:53:03,139
When skin irritation occurs
I can't control the situation

720
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:08,603
It's like being unable to live or die
That's the problem

721
00:53:42,595 --> 00:53:44,555
Gyeonwoo, are you okay?

722
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:49,560
Yeah, it's better than I thought

723
00:53:51,604 --> 00:53:52,813
thank god

724
00:54:03,115 --> 00:54:05,451
No, but
I don't think you're okay

725
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:06,452
uh?

726
00:54:10,498 --> 00:54:12,875
Oh, I see

727
00:56:02,318 --> 00:56:04,653
I feel a little better now

728
00:56:06,572 --> 00:56:07,406
A little bit?

729
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:10,451
Oh, how much?
Can you walk now?

730
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:13,537
huh

731
00:56:15,456 --> 00:56:17,625
Why does it hurt so much, ugh

732
00:56:18,459 --> 00:56:21,462
But really this
Can I avoid going to the hospital?

733
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:23,923
Yeah, it's really okay

734
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:28,052
But haven't you practiced archery?
How many days has it been?

735
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:29,678
Archery?

736
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:32,515
Has it been two or three days?

737
00:56:32,598 --> 00:56:33,432
uh?

738
00:56:35,476 --> 00:56:37,686
No way, let's go practice archery.

739
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:38,646
Oh, no, no, no

740
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:40,773
What, what are you talking about?
It hurts like this, I can't

741
00:56:40,856 --> 00:56:43,484
No, I'm really okay now.

742
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:44,819
Oh, no

743
00:56:46,362 --> 00:56:48,739
Look, I'm really okay.

744
00:56:49,865 --> 00:56:51,909
It's cute, but no, no

745
00:56:51,992 --> 00:56:53,369
No, Seong-ah

746
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:38,581
Oh, surprise

747
00:57:45,921 --> 00:57:48,507
When are you going to tell me the truth?

748
00:57:49,049 --> 00:57:49,884
uh?

749
00:57:51,177 --> 00:57:52,636
What all of a sudden?

750
00:57:54,013 --> 00:57:55,139
scapular

751
00:57:57,183 --> 00:57:58,225
Why me?

752
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:03,689
Bongsuya

753
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:06,275
What's the big deal, all of a sudden?

754
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:08,736
Because you are a beacon

755
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:15,576
No, suddenly
What are you talking about, Seong-ah?

756
00:58:22,917 --> 00:58:24,210
When you shoot a bow

757
00:58:28,339 --> 00:58:29,673
Don't do this, routine

758
00:58:31,592 --> 00:58:32,927
No, that's…

759
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:35,054
You're not Gyeonwu, Bongsu

760
00:58:36,639 --> 00:58:39,141
Seong-ah, why are you so scary?

761
00:58:40,809 --> 00:58:41,894
Bongsuya

762
00:58:43,103 --> 00:58:44,146
What about Gyeonwu?

763
00:58:46,899 --> 00:58:48,734
Where is Gyeonwu?

764
00:58:55,741 --> 00:58:56,742
I

765
00:59:00,829 --> 00:59:02,289
I ate it

766
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:48,961
Yeomhwa is planning to summon the grim reaper

767
00:59:49,044 --> 00:59:50,629
I want to live as a human being

768
00:59:50,713 --> 00:59:53,257
This guy can have a complete body
Please tell me how

769
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:56,343
When you become a human being
Who would love you?

770
00:59:56,427 --> 00:59:57,303
Are you two dating?

771
00:59:57,386 --> 00:59:59,763
No, I like it unilaterally
It's unrequited love

772
00:59:59,847 --> 01:00:00,931
Are you going to do it well?

773
01:00:01,015 --> 01:00:02,182
Yeah

774
01:00:02,266 --> 01:00:05,060
I'm Baek Gyeon Woo
I am Bae Gyeon-woo in front of you

775
01:00:05,144 --> 01:00:07,813
Gyeonwoo, I'll put it back properly

776
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:10,441
Please stay safe until then

777
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:13,193
Aren't you curious about the true feelings of the fairies of heaven and earth?

778
01:00:13,277 --> 01:00:14,695
