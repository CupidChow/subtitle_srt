1
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:15,785
It's such a tragedy
their eldest son is in that state.

2
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:17,787
Three shamans have run away already.

3
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,122
What? So this is the fourth one?

4
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:21,999
Stand back.

5
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,376
The stench will cling to you
if you stand too close.

6
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,838
The living are no match for a dead spirit
that has claimed a living person's body.

7
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:30,049
You will all die!

8
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:35,513
Oh, my. Is that a person or a ghost?

9
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:59,245
I wonder if she's a person or a ghost.

10
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:04,667
I see a lot of you have come
to join this party.

11
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:07,169
All right.

12
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:10,172
A Household God nestled
in the neighborhood

13
00:02:10,256 --> 00:02:11,549
of Baekjedang, Mokju, Gyeonggi-do.

14
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,802
A Lim woman gave birth to the eldest son
of the Geumcheon Kang family

15
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:16,262
in 1980, the Year of Monkey.

16
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:18,806
As he fell ill of an unknown disease,
I am here to pray.

17
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:22,226
Dear gods and spirits,
please accept my sincerity

18
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,478
and help him recover as soon as possible.

19
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,421
All right.

20
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:36,550
Let's go!

21
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:49,730
My dear spirit,

22
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,566
I have finished all of 12 rites
to console your soul

23
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,277
and invited your ancestral gods
and the Grim Reapers here.

24
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:57,571
It is time to go now.

25
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,281
I won't go.

26
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:02,326
I would only feel at ease
if you crossed over.

27
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:13,379
Turn off your alarm.

28
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,298
Quick, turn it off.

29
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,885
I'll find your phone and crush it.

30
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:22,721
She's in the zone. How disrespectful!

31
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:34,149
Ma'am, it's 7:30 a.m.
Let's wrap it up in ten minutes.

32
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:37,152
No, Lady Fairy.

33
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:39,071
Ten minutes. You must cross over by then.

34
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,406
You can do that, right?

35
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,116
Let's go.

36
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:54,628
I'm sorry. I'm short on time here.

37
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:56,839
If you don't go within ten minutes,
I must give up on you.

38
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:58,340
You're leaving me?

39
00:04:58,424 --> 00:05:00,634
-It's urgent.
-What can be more urgent than this?

40
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:02,845
There's this very urgent business.

41
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:04,763
So let's cross over now, okay?

42
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:07,224
You think I'm a pushover
because I'm a ghost?

43
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,309
Don't you dare blow smoke up my ass!

44
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:21,071
PARK SEONG-A
HWAMOK HIGH SCHOOL

45
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,118
-She's still a student?
-Isn't that a school uniform?

46
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,745
I have a midterm today.

47
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:30,789
Will you take responsibility
if I don't get into college?

48
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:34,001
You know what a bad GPA means
to a high school student, right?

49
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,838
Your hell is out there
across the Samdo River,

50
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:41,175
but mine is right here, in the present.

51
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,303
Will you cross over or not?

52
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,143
I'm late!

53
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,413
Wait!

54
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,084
No!

55
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,068
-Hi.
-Hi.

56
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:08,512
Nice catch.

57
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,558
What's this?

58
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,393
What are you doing here?

59
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:15,644
I was waiting for you.

60
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,604
For me? Why?

61
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,523
Do you really have to ask?

62
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:27,948
Without you…

63
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,451
I'm dead last in our class.

64
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,121
You're the only one
who can help me avoid that fate.

65
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,290
Gosh, I hate you.

66
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,418
Oh, my goodness.

67
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:41,670
-Why were you late today?
-Hey!

68
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:43,672
-What are you doing here?
-Hey, Ji-ho.

69
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:46,550
-Did you study for the test?
-I tried the thing we talked about.

70
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,302
-I actually studied.
-Have you ever heard of…

71
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,434
I was right behind.

72
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:04,610
In moments when others would feel
angry, flustered, or embarrassed,

73
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,029
I just smile

74
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,616
as if to tell myself it's not a big deal.

75
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:13,368
I force a smile.

76
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:17,206
But…

77
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,500
PARK SEONG-A
MATH

78
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,628
…I can't bring myself to smile right now.

79
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:30,928
Hands on your head.

80
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,972
Those in the back,
collect the answer sheets.

81
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:43,523
Good work today.

82
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:45,234
-Thank you, ma'am.
-Thank you, ma'am.

83
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,320
Did you bomb the test?

84
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,282
Still, don't punish yourself.

85
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:55,327
Ji-ho. What am I going to do?

86
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:57,829
No four-year college will accept me.

87
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,874
The only school you can get into
with your current grade

88
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:02,876
would be a middle school.

89
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,754
-Hey.
-Sorry. Force of habit.

90
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:07,965
Just wait and see.

91
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:10,592
I won't work tonight. I'll just study.

92
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:15,514
I'll make sure to do well
on tomorrow's exam.

93
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,770
I'll study at school and get home late.

94
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:26,400
But she really should get back early.

95
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:51,842
MO BEOM
HWAMOK HIGH SCHOOL

96
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:56,221
My stomach hurts.

97
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:11,737
What the hell's wrong with the lights?

98
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:23,165
MO BEOM

99
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:25,834
I should've gone to a private school.

100
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,461
This school's a dumpster.

101
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:18,887
Seong-a.

102
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:22,099
People who walk upside down

103
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,267
are cursed and have death
hanging over them.

104
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,606
A person should walk around like this.

105
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,442
-Do you like this?
-What?

106
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,611
You can have it.

107
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,780
Remember. This is yours.

108
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,909
They'll come like this.

109
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:50,627
I… I saw a ghost.

110
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,838
There was a Water Ghost in the restroom.

111
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:03,682
I'm serious.

112
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:09,938
He must be in bad shape.

113
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:14,734
Speaking of, I think I saw
something strange just now.

114
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,779
Park Seong-a's yet another nickname.

115
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,407
Sleeping Student with the Lowest Grade!

116
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,034
You're at it again! Go home.

117
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:24,703
-See you.
-Bye.

118
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,630
BUTCHER'S GRILL BBQ

119
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,010
I'll help you cross over soon.

120
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:42,762
Hang in there.

121
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,062
When will they open?

122
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:57,861
The business is booming, I see.

123
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,117
You're late.

124
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:18,590
What sort of a shaman
runs off in the middle of a rite?

125
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,260
Mother.

126
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,846
I didn't run off.

127
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:28,517
Good heavens, so you dare
to run your mouth?

128
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:36,441
Heaven's above.
Now you're refusing to talk to me?

129
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:47,369
What exactly do you want me to do, Mother?

130
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:50,997
You stole the words right out of my mouth.
What exactly are you trying to do,

131
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:54,209
my annoyingly lovely spirit-daughter?

132
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:56,586
You already know.

133
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:58,630
College?

134
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:01,841
-Must be a four-year one too.
-Which field? Which major?

135
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:03,677
What's your plan after college?

136
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,431
There must be no plan

137
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,642
because you'll continue
to be a shaman anyway.

138
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:11,726
College?

139
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:14,688
That's just your greed talking.

140
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:18,191
It may be a life's goal
or opportunity to other kids,

141
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:22,362
but to you, it is just a vain dream
that is completely useless.

142
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,322
Not many can wield two swords.

143
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:27,033
Who throws away their sharpened sword
to pick up a rusty one?

144
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:28,285
My dear.

145
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,829
That's exactly what you're doing now.

146
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:33,873
You'll starve to death while trying
to have the best of both worlds.

147
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:36,501
But I want to go to college festivals.

148
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:39,296
I want to roll on a campus yard,
eat pajeon, and drink makgeolli.

149
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,048
Then, I could even skip an exam
and get a warning.

150
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:43,216
That far?

151
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:46,720
It's a dream.

152
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,224
Mother, you see,

153
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:54,561
I love it when a stranger
refers to me as a student.

154
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:57,230
They see me as one because of my uniform.

155
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,984
Just like all the other kids,
I get to be ordinary.

156
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:06,990
When I'm actually a shaman.

157
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,953
I know too, you know.

158
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:16,374
I know I'm just dreaming
an impossible dream.

159
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,587
Dream about being an ordinary girl.

160
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:33,391
Couldn't you let me dream
just a bit longer?

161
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:36,478
Let it slide just this once. Please?

162
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:43,943
You sure have a way with words, don't you?

163
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:45,278
My efforts were so worth it.

164
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,827
But let me be clear about one thing.

165
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:55,705
You must prioritize your clients
above all else.

166
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:58,833
Don't be irresponsible
like you were today ever again.

167
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:01,252
You got that, Seong-a?

168
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,380
Yes, Mother.

169
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:07,759
They must be opening now.

170
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,933
All right, please come inside.

171
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:21,272
I can't find a job.

172
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:23,817
Don't cry. There is a way.

173
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:31,658
When people face a crisis in life,
they seek a shaman.

174
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,619
His business has failed
three times already.

175
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:36,621
It must go well this time.

176
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:38,957
People without money want money.

177
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,584
All I can do after work
is to wait to hear from my star.

178
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,503
It gets so lonely.

179
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,964
Singles want to get married.

180
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:47,298
PREGNANT LADY FIRST

181
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:52,554
This time,
I hope the baby finds me safely.

182
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:56,182
Those without children
want to raise children.

183
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,143
I want to move out.

184
00:16:58,226 --> 00:16:59,310
I miss my mom.

185
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:01,438
When can I finally leave Korea?

186
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:02,856
How can I live in Korea longer?

187
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,691
No one will buy my house.

188
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,776
I want to buy a place of my own.

189
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,486
-I want to cry.
-I want to smile.

190
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:18,246
A crisis in life comes to us
when we don't have what we want.

191
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:22,792
People become unhappy as they envy others.

192
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:27,464
I want to tell them
to focus on what they already have,

193
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:31,426
but to be honest,
even I'm having trouble doing that.

194
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:36,765
You see, I envy all of you.

195
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,143
Except for one type of people.

196
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:45,273
This is why you shouldn't date someone
just because they like you.

197
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:47,817
Then what should I consider?

198
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,819
Face card.

199
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:51,738
Excuse me?

200
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:54,657
If you liked someone for their looks,
they'd look the same no matter what.

201
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,993
Then you'd have no reason to cry.
Because nothing would've changed.

202
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,162
What if they don't like me?

203
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:02,123
That doesn't matter.
You can still dig their looks.

204
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:06,377
You've never been in a relationship,
have you?

205
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,007
Single all your life, right?

206
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:15,345
Who cares about feelings?
You can't even see it.

207
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,848
Why get carried away by that
instead of something solid like looks

208
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,058
and cry over it?

209
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:22,310
I just don't understand.

210
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:25,230
Isn't it obvious?
How can you not consider it?

211
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:27,148
All I care about is looks.

212
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,276
I don't get swayed
by ever-so-changing feelings.

213
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,361
Whatever.

214
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,326
Let's say there's a hot guy.

215
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:41,329
But he's a murderer.
Would you still like him?

216
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:43,248
Hey, that's--

217
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:45,708
See? Other factors matter to you too.

218
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:49,629
That example was too extreme.

219
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:52,173
So? What else would you consider
other than looks?

220
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:00,515
Let's say there's a stranger

221
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:02,517
crying on the street, all alone.

222
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:06,271
-Why?
-You don't know why. It's a stranger.

223
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:07,814
Even so,

224
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:11,693
I want my crush to be someone
who'd go over and comfort them.

225
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:15,947
Isn't that too easy?

226
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,074
Who'd just walk past them?
That'd be heartless.

227
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,164
Most people just walk by.

228
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,918
They think,
"They must have no one to comfort them,"

229
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:31,754
or "They must have no place to cry in."

230
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:34,465
They just walk by.

231
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:42,682
I'm handsome enough.

232
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:45,727
So I just need to comfort a crying person?

233
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:49,939
What do you say?

234
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,568
You're out. Not handsome enough.

235
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:55,695
Hey. I'm good-looking enough.

236
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:57,488
You're totally out.

237
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:06,080
My spirit-daughter will make
a lot of money tonight as well.

238
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:08,249
Excuse me.

239
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:11,127
Is this Heaven and Earth Fairy's shrine?

240
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,343
Yes, it is.

241
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,595
I see. Thank you.

242
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:22,805
This is the place. Let's go, Gyeon-u.

243
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:24,432
Your grandson is very…

244
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,976
I know, he's very handsome.

245
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,353
We get that a lot.

246
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:33,232
Indeed.

247
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:35,610
He's very handsome.

248
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:50,375
Here comes the last client.

249
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,168
Please come in.

250
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:07,767
I found him.

251
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:10,603
He's so handsome.

252
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:11,813
He's totally my type.

253
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,149
Fine eyes.

254
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:16,859
A sharp nose.

255
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:18,277
Plump lips.

256
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:19,988
Goodness.

257
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:22,156
He's even handsome upside down.

258
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:25,284
What? Wait a minute.

259
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,620
Upside down?

260
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:46,055
Remember.

261
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:47,140
This is yours.

262
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,017
They'll come like this.

263
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:55,982
Was that a clairvoyant dream?

264
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:02,613
Even so, this is not fair.

265
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:04,240
Well…

266
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:08,661
My grandson is plagued with misfortune.

267
00:22:09,704 --> 00:22:12,373
He was at death's door so many times.

268
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:15,334
I came to ask you for an amulet

269
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:17,295
that will protect him.

270
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,174
I see.

271
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:23,801
He can't die. He's too handsome.

272
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:28,014
Please save my grandson's life.

273
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,390
But he will die.

274
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:32,602
He has about 21 days left at most.

275
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:37,815
Gyeon-u, don't you have anything to say?

276
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,154
I don't.

277
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,884
Excuse me.

278
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:07,220
I meant you, mister.

279
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,139
Let's say

280
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:12,558
there's a stranger
crying on the street all alone.

281
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:15,311
You happen to see them. What would you do?

282
00:23:17,522 --> 00:23:18,689
Well…

283
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,234
I want my crush…

284
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:25,113
I guess I would stand next to them.

285
00:23:25,947 --> 00:23:26,948
Then what?

286
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:30,409
…to be someone
who'd go over and comfort them.

287
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:32,954
I'd just stand there

288
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,540
until they stop crying.

289
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:39,585
No words of comfort?

290
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:42,964
What do I know to comfort them?

291
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:46,217
I'm a nobody.
I don't know anything about them.

292
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,511
But…

293
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:53,224
I can stand by their side
even if I don't know anything.

294
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:06,779
You pass!

295
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,867
Let's save you.

296
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,660
Lady Fairy?

297
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:14,579
I'll save him.

298
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:16,164
I'll fend off all misfortune.

299
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:19,917
I promise you to free him from misfortune
after the next three weeks.

300
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:23,796
Oh, sure.

301
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:37,101
Goodbye.

302
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:38,186
Come again.

303
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:43,316
Save him?

304
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,736
Who's saving whom?

305
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:51,908
-You see…
-Ma'am. Let's drive out bad luck.

306
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:01,083
Let's just go.

307
00:25:02,627 --> 00:25:03,961
Let's go.

308
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:06,339
Mother.

309
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:08,925
Take back my promise? He's my client.

310
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:11,844
-Do you have the ability to handle it?
-I do.

311
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,390
If you help me out a little…

312
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:17,516
Hey, you fool.

313
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,103
Did you forget how you nearly died
while trying to save the BBQ place's Choi?

314
00:25:21,938 --> 00:25:23,439
Back then…

315
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:27,526
Upside down?

316
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:33,658
Keep this with you at all times.

317
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:35,660
You got that?

318
00:25:45,253 --> 00:25:46,337
Why you little…

319
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:48,965
CHOI GWANG-SIK
PETTY EVIL SPIRITS

320
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:04,730
BUTCHER'S GRILL BBQ

321
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,869
This…

322
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:21,080
It isn't supposed to be here.

323
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,053
This wasn't too long ago,

324
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:38,180
and yet you promised the impossible again.

325
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:41,976
If he walked in upside down,
the law of equivalent exchange is applied.

326
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:45,563
You must risk your own life
in order to save his.

327
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:46,731
Can you do that?

328
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:49,066
That's why I need your help--

329
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:53,446
You must take on all evil spirits
coming at him.

330
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:55,323
I may have a general god in me,

331
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:58,075
but I can't fight off
hundreds, thousands of spirits.

332
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,578
But if we work hard enough…

333
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:02,788
Why would we? What's so special about him?

334
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:09,253
I fell for him at first sight.

335
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:21,307
What's wrong?
Did you bomb the test that badly?

336
00:27:22,058 --> 00:27:24,560
Don't tell me you got a big, fat zero.

337
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:28,105
I don't have the energy.
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

338
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:33,736
-Are you sick?
-Have a seat, everyone.

339
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,112
Are you doing well with the exams?

340
00:27:35,196 --> 00:27:36,489
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

341
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:38,741
I know you're busy,
so I'll get to the point.

342
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:41,035
We have a transfer student
joining our class.

343
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:44,163
What? Who transfers during midterms?

344
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:45,748
What a strange timing.

345
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:48,084
Don't be silly.

346
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,753
He's obviously new here,
so help him get settled in.

347
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,380
-You got that?
-Yes, sir.

348
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:53,714
Come in, Gyeon-u.

349
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:13,734
BAE GYEON-U
HWAMOK HIGH SCHOOL

350
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:21,492
-He's handsome.
-I'm so moved.

351
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:24,245
Is he an idol trainee?

352
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:25,413
What a face card.

353
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:34,004
What is it, Seong-a? Do you know him?

354
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:41,262
-No, I don't.
-Then why are you so surprised?

355
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:42,596
Are you an attention seeker?

356
00:28:44,098 --> 00:28:46,475
-No.
-Then why did you stand up?

357
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,644
You're usually napping at your desk.

358
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,730
What? Did the handsome new student
inspire you to wake up

359
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:52,940
and spring to your feet?

360
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:56,193
What a pick-me.

361
00:28:56,277 --> 00:28:58,904
Hey, Seong-a.
Hye-ri just called you a pick-me.

362
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:00,448
Maeng Ju-seung, shut it.

363
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:08,330
Do I look like one?

364
00:29:11,876 --> 00:29:14,128
She doesn't know
what "pick-me" means, does she?

365
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:16,338
She can't be smiling
if she knew what it means.

366
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:19,967
Seong-a, let me explain
what "pick-me" means.

367
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:23,053
A girl who is absolutely obsessed

368
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:24,763
-with men.
-You do look familiar.

369
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,100
Park Seong-a?

370
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,897
I think I've met you before.

371
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,941
-Did they really meet before?
-They know each other?

372
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:38,402
He must really know Seong-a.
Unbelievable.

373
00:29:38,486 --> 00:29:39,737
-What?
-Do they know each other?

374
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:42,531
-May I introduce myself?
-Yes, of course.

375
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,911
Hello, everyone. I'm Bae Gyeon-u.

376
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:49,788
It's nice to meet you.

377
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:51,957
A round of applause.

378
00:29:53,918 --> 00:29:56,170
You can take the empty seat over there.

379
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:05,846
Don't go anywhere to hang out
just because school is out early.

380
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,348
Study, guys.

381
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:09,141
Exams aren't over yet.

382
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:10,351
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

383
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:12,102
Stay focused until the end, okay?

384
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:13,521
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

385
00:30:27,535 --> 00:30:29,453
-Excuse me--
-You don't look familiar.

386
00:30:29,537 --> 00:30:30,996
I've never met you before.

387
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,164
What?

388
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:34,917
But earlier…

389
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,545
Are you really a pick…

390
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:42,591
-Is that what you are?
-No, I'm not like that.

391
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:45,761
Then don't laugh over such a thing.

392
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,598
Laughing about a bad thing won't change it
into a good thing.

393
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,485
So he didn't recognize
I'm Heaven and Earth Fairy.

394
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:04,780
But he pretended he did for me?

395
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:09,243
He took my side

396
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:11,870
even though he'd never met me?

397
00:31:13,289 --> 00:31:14,290
For no reason?

398
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:17,793
You think that's cool?

399
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,878
It's not exactly cool, is it?

400
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:21,046
No.

401
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,631
Then is it sexy?

402
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:24,341
-What?
-He's totally my type.

403
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,347
But you said
he doesn't have much time left.

404
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:33,976
You said those who walk into your shrine
upside down will die soon.

405
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:36,895
I must make sure he doesn't die,
no matter what.

406
00:31:37,605 --> 00:31:39,648
-How?
-Well…

407
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:41,233
Jyojyo!

408
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:43,152
Oh, Hye-ri. What is it?

409
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:46,238
You promised to go to the study café
with me today, remember?

410
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:48,198
-Did I?
-Oh, come on.

411
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:51,285
Let's go.

412
00:31:52,453 --> 00:31:53,954
You had plans?

413
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:56,999
Then you should go with Hye-ri.
Goodbye, Ji-ho.

414
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:58,125
Hey, Seong-a!

415
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:02,671
I didn't mean what I said
earlier in class.

416
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:05,174
I know that, Class President.

417
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,134
Just forget about it.

418
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:11,472
But then again, it's kind of true.

419
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:14,141
Yeah, it's okay. It didn't bother me.

420
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:17,936
I should get going now.

421
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,438
Study hard, guys.

422
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:23,484
-Goodbye.
-Don't be late tomorrow.

423
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:25,569
-I won't catch you again.
-Okay.

424
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:33,952
Then don't laugh over such a thing.

425
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:36,705
Laughing about a bad thing won't change it
into a good thing.

426
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:43,253
He should be a shaman, not me.

427
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,852
Gyeong-min, draw with confidence.
Relax your shoulders.

428
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:08,570
BAE GYEON-U
JOONGHYUN HIGH

429
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:12,282
Three.

430
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:14,618
JOONGHYUN HIGH SCHOOL

431
00:33:14,702 --> 00:33:15,744
Two.

432
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:17,705
NATIONAL ARCHERY COMPETITION

433
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,208
One.

434
00:33:22,376 --> 00:33:23,377
Ten.

435
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,227
See? I told you relaxing is the key!

436
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,106
-That was awesome.
-Nice shot.

437
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:45,858
Wasn't that your first time?

438
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:48,485
-My goodness.
-You're good, dude.

439
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:54,950
Look at his arms.

440
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,452
Hey, look at his arms.

441
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:58,078
That was great.

442
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:15,554
Hey.

443
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:18,891
Will you go to the restroom with me?

444
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:23,312
Did too much studying make you go crazy?

445
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:24,271
Take it easy, buddy.

446
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,858
Don't be like that.
Come with me just this once.

447
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:30,360
What are you doing? That's gross.
Go by yourself, you idiot.

448
00:34:30,444 --> 00:34:31,278
Dang it.

449
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:34,656
Do me a favor and come with me!
You're a nice guy!

450
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:38,035
I'm not nice enough
to go to the restroom with you!

451
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:52,007
Newbie.

452
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:54,009
What are you doing?

453
00:34:55,803 --> 00:34:56,970
Can't you hear me?

454
00:34:57,054 --> 00:34:58,514
You're not ignoring me, are you?

455
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:01,725
You are ignoring me, all right.

456
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:04,645
He's hurting my feelings.

457
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:08,190
What was he doing here?

458
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:11,026
-Hey, buddy.
-Yes?

459
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,070
You've been watching us
this whole time, right?

460
00:35:13,654 --> 00:35:16,240
No, I just got here. It was someone else.

461
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:17,950
Wow. Look at you.

462
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:20,536
You have a nice build.

463
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:23,413
Yes, I do get that a lot.

464
00:35:23,497 --> 00:35:25,165
Right? Why don't you try archery?

465
00:35:25,249 --> 00:35:26,291
Just like that?

466
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:29,962
All you have to do is make up your mind.
I'll take care of the rest.

467
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:31,964
So?

468
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:35,300
Get a grip, sir.

469
00:35:35,384 --> 00:35:38,095
I know the team is a cellar dweller,
but you've got to be more selective.

470
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:43,433
Goodness.

471
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:45,686
He's a huge jerk, too.

472
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,813
He's perfect for archery.

473
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:54,987
Why haven't they fixed the lights yet?

474
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,825
Oh, come on.

475
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:02,995
Unbelievable.

476
00:36:18,594 --> 00:36:21,263
Just don't look up at the ceiling.
Just don't look up.

477
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:27,477
Oh, come on.

478
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:22,532
BUTCHER'S GRILL BBQ

479
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,515
Three, two, one.

480
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:50,268
Three, two, one.

481
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,439
Three, two, one.

482
00:37:56,817 --> 00:38:00,988
If he walked in upside down,
the law of equivalent exchange is applied.

483
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:03,865
You must risk your own life
in order to save his.

484
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:04,950
Can you do that?

485
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:08,578
I could help the BBQ place owner
to cross over even now.

486
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,035
No!

487
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:17,230
Hey, are you all right?

488
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:19,649
What? Oh, sure.

489
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:21,151
What about you?

490
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:24,654
You're not okay.

491
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,491
What were you thinking?

492
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:30,368
-Why did you jump in like that?
-What?

493
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:34,039
I was trying to save you.
That sign was falling off.

494
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:37,876
But you saved me instead.
Sorry. It's my fault.

495
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,628
-Is it serious?
-I'm fine.

496
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:44,466
-Don't worry about it.
-How can I not worry? You're hurt.

497
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:46,760
Are you meddlesome or simply careless?

498
00:39:48,095 --> 00:39:50,138
Jumping in like that isn't kind.
It's foolish.

499
00:39:50,222 --> 00:39:52,557
Did you think I'd thank you
for coming to my rescue?

500
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,480
Hey.

501
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:00,816
But I'm grateful to you for saving me.

502
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:02,984
By the way, why aren't you surprised?

503
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:05,695
Does this happen often?
Is it always like this?

504
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,288
Mother, you're the one who told me
to prioritize promises made to my clients.

505
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:19,417
I'm merely keeping my promise.

506
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:22,379
I'll be back soon.

507
00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:31,221
SUWON, YANGYANG

508
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:37,936
FLOWER MASTER'S SHRINE

509
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:46,444
Yes? Come in.

510
00:40:56,204 --> 00:41:00,458
My mother always told me
to follow your footsteps.

511
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:03,211
Doing a lot of rites
doesn't mean anything.

512
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:06,631
Those who give out effective amulets
make the most money.

513
00:41:06,715 --> 00:41:08,592
Someone like Flower Master.

514
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:11,219
Shamans like him
don't even dance on blades.

515
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:13,305
Their soles are as soft as a baby's.

516
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:15,974
Oh, those darn soles.

517
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:17,684
Those annoying soles.

518
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:24,191
She said you serve the Dragon King
and make the best amulets.

519
00:41:29,863 --> 00:41:30,864
She did?

520
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,074
Yes.

521
00:41:33,909 --> 00:41:35,410
I do make the best…

522
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:38,330
But I'm not making one for you. I can't.

523
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:39,581
In fact, I won't.

524
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:41,917
-Why? Why won't you?
-Do you have to ask?

525
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,252
Your spirit-mother is General Dongcheon.

526
00:41:44,336 --> 00:41:45,462
She has…

527
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:46,755
-the sword.
-The sword!

528
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:47,881
You know she owns one.

529
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:49,799
Yes, she does.

530
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:53,136
What if she beats me with her sword
because I made you one behind her back?

531
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:56,306
My soles won't survive.

532
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:00,185
So he's been beaten in his soles.

533
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:05,607
It's just that I really want to
save this person.

534
00:42:09,778 --> 00:42:11,446
Wait, is it a guy?

535
00:42:12,656 --> 00:42:13,907
Do you like him?

536
00:42:16,952 --> 00:42:19,371
You're completely blinded by love,
aren't you?

537
00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:23,833
Move. You're too close.

538
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:26,086
-You're getting in the way.
-I'm sorry.

539
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:35,679
You see…

540
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:38,265
This bit right here.

541
00:42:38,348 --> 00:42:39,849
I'm afraid I'm not happy with it.

542
00:42:39,933 --> 00:42:41,685
-Again. It isn't right.
-What's wrong with this one?

543
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:43,853
-Again. Again!
-Then do it yourself.

544
00:42:45,522 --> 00:42:46,648
Gyeon-u.

545
00:42:47,983 --> 00:42:49,359
I'm going to save you.

546
00:42:54,531 --> 00:42:55,532
Let's do this!

547
00:42:56,533 --> 00:42:57,534
All right.

548
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:05,292
EMERGENCY SERVICES

549
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:06,918
He was found unconscious
in the men's room.

550
00:43:07,002 --> 00:43:08,670
But why is he soaked?

551
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:10,422
-A Water Ghost…
-What on earth?

552
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:13,300
It was a Water Ghost…

553
00:43:14,009 --> 00:43:16,511
What happened to him?
Do you think he's badly hurt?

554
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:19,264
Oh, no. I mean, he collapsed.
What if he's in bad shape?

555
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:25,145
That didn't hurt at all.

556
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:33,987
Jeez, she's late again.

557
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:42,912
Gyeon-u, everything is fine now.

558
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:44,581
I did it.

559
00:43:45,582 --> 00:43:47,500
I need to save your life…

560
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,296
Why is everything so blurry?

561
00:43:57,177 --> 00:43:58,219
What's wrong with her?

562
00:44:01,598 --> 00:44:04,267
I need to sleep.
I didn't get any sleep last night.

563
00:44:10,774 --> 00:44:12,400
Is she a total nutjob or what?

564
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:16,112
PARK SEONG-A = NUTJOB

565
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:20,784
FROM HYE-RI

566
00:44:23,787 --> 00:44:27,040
Gyeon-u, wanna go
to the coin karaoke after the exams?

567
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:28,958
I'm Cho Hye-ri
in the second row, second column.

568
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:48,561
Watch it, you guys.

569
00:44:48,645 --> 00:44:51,314
Don't lose your focus
before the last exam.

570
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:55,652
PLEASE TELL ME
YOUR STARGRAM HANDLE

571
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:57,320
-Internet café later?
-How about a photo booth?

572
00:44:57,404 --> 00:44:59,739
-Got a girlfriend?
-Please tell me your Stargram handle.

573
00:45:32,439 --> 00:45:33,898
I won't see any ghosts.

574
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:36,443
I'll be a good girl.

575
00:45:37,652 --> 00:45:39,654
Don't leave me.

576
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:43,491
Please don't leave me.

577
00:46:00,884 --> 00:46:02,469
How long was I asleep for?

578
00:46:09,851 --> 00:46:11,811
YOU WOULDN'T WAKE UP,
SO I'M OFF! JI-HO

579
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:21,738
Right. The amulets.

580
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:25,366
Dang it. I should've given them to him.

581
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:32,457
My original plan was to tell him who I am
as I give him these amulets

582
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:35,460
and kick-start our romance.

583
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:37,712
What a shame. It was an amazing plan.

584
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:41,216
You said you didn't want anyone
to know what you were.

585
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:43,218
That's why you wear that mask.

586
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,762
I want to hide my identity
from my clients.

587
00:46:45,845 --> 00:46:48,765
But there should be no secrets
with your loved one.

588
00:46:49,766 --> 00:46:52,644
Spider-Man took off his mask
when he kissed MJ too.

589
00:46:54,687 --> 00:46:56,105
Only halfway.

590
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,858
Did he?

591
00:46:58,942 --> 00:47:01,903
Why did he do that?
Was he shy because it was the first kiss?

592
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:04,197
If your spirit-mother finds out,
she'll be furious--

593
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,281
Oh, forget it.

594
00:47:05,365 --> 00:47:07,742
Does she always have to be the right one?

595
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,619
I can be right sometimes too.

596
00:47:09,702 --> 00:47:12,497
Why would she stop me
from saving someone? I don't get it.

597
00:47:13,957 --> 00:47:15,667
I'm staying out of this.

598
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:19,837
That must be your client.

599
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,469
I've come to collect the amulet, ma'am.

600
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:38,606
I was told you have an amulet for me.

601
00:47:40,942 --> 00:47:42,026
Where's your grandson?

602
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:46,281
He doesn't usually come
to places like this.

603
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:49,242
I had to drag him here the other day.

604
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,830
-That's not good.
-Pardon?

605
00:47:57,584 --> 00:47:59,252
These amulets

606
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:01,963
would only be effective

607
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:04,882
when the client himself sees them
and listens to the instructions.

608
00:48:04,966 --> 00:48:07,260
So your grandson must be here in person.

609
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:11,514
No exception.

610
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:13,308
Okay.

611
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,188
He's almost here.

612
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:25,820
Gyeon-u.

613
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:29,699
He was handsome in the morning,
and he's handsome in the evening too.

614
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:31,618
He's even handsome upside down.

615
00:48:31,701 --> 00:48:33,077
So handsome…

616
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:41,336
Gyeon-u, you…

617
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:44,213
Are you…

618
00:48:46,466 --> 00:48:48,384
Are you going to drown to death?

619
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:08,821
Park Seong-iced-tea.

620
00:49:09,906 --> 00:49:11,240
Park Seong-americano?

621
00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:15,828
Seong-a, are you better now?

622
00:49:18,206 --> 00:49:19,874
I won't see any ghosts.

623
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:25,505
I'll be a good girl. Don't leave me.

624
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:41,187
Oh, no.

625
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:43,731
If I can see it this clearly,
he has less than a day left.

626
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:45,733
You look terrible.

627
00:49:46,526 --> 00:49:49,278
Even more misfortune flocked to you
in that short amount of time.

628
00:49:50,738 --> 00:49:53,241
-But with these amulets--
-So how much are they?

629
00:49:54,367 --> 00:49:55,368
What?

630
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:56,869
I didn't think about the price.

631
00:49:57,662 --> 00:50:00,248
Would he see through me
if I gave them for free?

632
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:03,835
Telling him how I feel
with amulets would be weird.

633
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:07,630
The price…

634
00:50:07,714 --> 00:50:09,507
Ten million won? Twenty million?

635
00:50:10,383 --> 00:50:12,093
Or is it 100 million in total,
10 million each?

636
00:50:12,885 --> 00:50:14,679
Or will you give us a discount this time

637
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:18,141
and charge for a rite too
when I'm back again in worse shape?

638
00:50:18,224 --> 00:50:19,559
Gyeon-u.

639
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:22,478
-What are you--
-Con artist.

640
00:50:22,562 --> 00:50:23,563
Gyeon-u.

641
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:26,315
We've met countless shamans like you.

642
00:50:26,399 --> 00:50:28,025
You aren't interested in helping anyway.

643
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:30,027
You just want our money!

644
00:50:31,404 --> 00:50:33,156
Watch what you say to me!

645
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:35,658
What do you take me for?

646
00:50:38,244 --> 00:50:39,287
You know what?

647
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:40,997
Misfortune is contagious.

648
00:50:41,581 --> 00:50:44,375
That's why ordinary people
don't go near the unfortunate.

649
00:50:44,876 --> 00:50:47,086
They may offer charity,
but they won't eat with them.

650
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:49,589
Those who ask to eat with them?

651
00:50:49,672 --> 00:50:51,507
They're either idiots or con artists.

652
00:50:51,591 --> 00:50:54,761
But you aren't an idiot,
which means you're a con artist.

653
00:50:56,179 --> 00:50:57,430
Let's go, Grandma.

654
00:50:57,513 --> 00:50:58,514
Gyeon-u.

655
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:01,350
Whether I'm an idiot or a con artist,

656
00:51:01,434 --> 00:51:03,770
give it one final shot and believe in me.

657
00:51:03,853 --> 00:51:05,855
You won't lose anything from doing so.

658
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:08,608
If I believe you,
I'll lose money and become unhappy.

659
00:51:09,192 --> 00:51:10,359
If I don't believe you,

660
00:51:12,028 --> 00:51:13,571
I'll only be unhappy.

661
00:51:17,366 --> 00:51:18,659
Let's go, Grandma.

662
00:51:19,494 --> 00:51:21,579
I'm so sorry.

663
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:38,596
LET'S GET INTO
A FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE!

664
00:51:40,223 --> 00:51:42,433
BAE GYEON-U! SAVE HIM!
PROTECT HIM!

665
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:51,067
Gyeon-u's destined to drown to death,
and the amulets are still with me.

666
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:54,779
Three weeks from now.

667
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:58,199
I will protect you no matter what.

668
00:52:01,661 --> 00:52:03,371
RESERVOIRS NEAR JANGHYEON-GU

669
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:07,792
What are you so focused on?

670
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:09,544
I'm looking for places
where people may drown.

671
00:52:10,253 --> 00:52:11,254
That's random.

672
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:14,340
This is bad. There are so many.

673
00:52:15,758 --> 00:52:17,009
There are more than 100.

674
00:52:20,388 --> 00:52:23,099
He just moved here,
so he wouldn't know too many places.

675
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:25,476
Should I just ask him where he's been to?

676
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,437
Would that seem too suspicious?
What should I do?

677
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,318
Oh, the newbie?

678
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,822
There are so many.

679
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:39,991
Don't give all of them to the newbie.

680
00:52:40,074 --> 00:52:41,993
Leave at least one for Beom.

681
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:44,704
He collapsed in the restroom
and was taken to the hospital.

682
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:47,707
-That's because he's too weak.
-I don't think so.

683
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:49,500
I think he saw something.

684
00:52:49,584 --> 00:52:54,297
The day before, he asked me to go
to the restroom with him in the evening.

685
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:56,674
-That's because you're a pushover.
-Seriously?

686
00:52:56,757 --> 00:53:00,261
-Besides, I can't give one to Beom.
-Why not?

687
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:02,638
He's not as handsome as Gyeon-u.

688
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:06,893
That was really harsh.

689
00:53:14,734 --> 00:53:18,070
So, they're looking for new recruits…

690
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:23,951
Why am I worried?

691
00:53:24,035 --> 00:53:25,995
He won't know
that I'm Heaven and Earth Fairy.

692
00:53:32,627 --> 00:53:35,212
By the way, why is the wall so damp?

693
00:53:56,484 --> 00:53:59,570
MEN'S ROOM

694
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:05,785
Leave at least one for Beom.

695
00:54:05,868 --> 00:54:08,245
He collapsed in the restroom
and was taken to the hospital.

696
00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:10,957
I saw Water Ghost in the restroom.

697
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:13,376
She was hanging from the ceiling.

698
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:16,462
Her mouth was like a clown's.
It was so scary.

699
00:54:18,005 --> 00:54:19,090
Everyone, have a seat.

700
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:24,845
What? Where's Park Seong-a gone?

701
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:26,013
Where did she go?

702
00:54:29,684 --> 00:54:31,102
Maybe she went to the restroom.

703
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:33,145
CLEANING IN PROGRESS

704
00:54:33,229 --> 00:54:35,523
When a person encounters Water Ghost,

705
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:38,109
they can drown even in shallow water.

706
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:32,496
You have a death wish?

707
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,582
Do you have a death wish?

708
00:55:38,002 --> 00:55:41,547
That's exactly why
you should never do bad things.

709
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:43,841
You just want to scare them,
then you want their energy.

710
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:45,718
Then you want to eat them up.

711
00:55:45,801 --> 00:55:47,970
That's how you become an evil spirit.

712
00:55:50,306 --> 00:55:53,350
But don't worry.
I will help you cross over.

713
00:55:53,434 --> 00:55:56,270
But don't go after the students
ever again. Okay?

714
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:58,564
Go on. Let's pinky swear.

715
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:02,151
You pinky swore.

716
00:56:02,777 --> 00:56:03,861
I'll get going now.

717
00:56:06,447 --> 00:56:09,033
Move to the women's room.
It'll be easier for me to help you there.

718
00:56:10,493 --> 00:56:12,495
I'll get going now. You better behave.

719
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:17,333
What the heck was that sign for?
There's no one in here.

720
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:19,126
I got scared for no reason.

721
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:22,129
So-mang, give me a light.

722
00:56:22,213 --> 00:56:24,590
Hey. Isn't our homeroom teacher funny?

723
00:56:24,673 --> 00:56:26,801
-He is, actually.
-What's this?

724
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:31,555
-There's someone in here.
-For real?

725
00:56:32,473 --> 00:56:34,266
-Oh, no.
-Hey.

726
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:36,060
Enjoy second-hand smoking.

727
00:56:41,649 --> 00:56:44,026
-It smells great, doesn't it?
-Maybe he's dead.

728
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:45,152
He's not reacting at all.

729
00:56:52,952 --> 00:56:54,787
-Newbie?
-Gyeon-u?

730
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:56,997
Man, look at yourself.

731
00:56:57,832 --> 00:56:59,792
Life must be great with that face card.

732
00:57:02,545 --> 00:57:03,546
Life isn't great.

733
00:57:06,507 --> 00:57:07,842
Wow.

734
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:09,593
Charismatic, aren't you?

735
00:57:17,143 --> 00:57:18,644
Should we get out of here?

736
00:57:24,525 --> 00:57:27,111
-It is an iffy amount of money
-Just pay for it, man.

737
00:57:27,194 --> 00:57:28,904
-You pay.
-Fine, I will. Jeez.

738
00:57:30,573 --> 00:57:31,574
No.

739
00:58:13,616 --> 00:58:16,702
-I wouldn't quibble with it.
-Me neither.

740
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:19,914
What the hell?

741
00:58:20,623 --> 00:58:21,790
-Park Seong-a.
-What's she up to?

742
00:58:21,874 --> 00:58:23,209
-What's she doing?
-Why are you here?

743
00:58:26,545 --> 00:58:27,546
Jeez, hey!

744
00:58:33,802 --> 00:58:35,930
-Stop it.
-Turn that off.

745
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:37,598
-What on earth?
-Stop it!

746
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:39,099
Hey, stop it. Come on!

747
00:59:03,916 --> 00:59:05,125
What the hell are you doing?

748
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:08,212
Well, you see…

749
00:59:09,588 --> 00:59:10,589
Well,

750
00:59:11,674 --> 00:59:12,800
I was…

751
00:59:14,927 --> 00:59:15,928
You see…

752
00:59:18,264 --> 00:59:19,515
Protecting you…

753
01:00:06,812 --> 01:00:10,024
Misfortune will sweep over him anytime
during those 21 days.

754
01:00:10,107 --> 01:00:11,692
He's already bound for the afterlife.

755
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:13,902
The newbie is an arsonist.

756
01:00:13,986 --> 01:00:15,195
Stay away from him. Far away.

757
01:00:15,279 --> 01:00:16,655
Are you so desperate
to help out a pitiful guy?

758
01:00:16,739 --> 01:00:18,866
You said no to a murderer
even if he was handsome.

759
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:21,368
I see more than what others can, remember?

760
01:00:21,452 --> 01:00:23,620
I believe in what I see, not some rumors.

761
01:00:23,704 --> 01:00:25,664
-Let's become friends.
-I just don't like people.

762
01:00:25,748 --> 01:00:28,584
From this point onward,
I'll keep reaching out to you.

763
01:00:29,168 --> 01:00:30,669
Even so, I will save you.

764
01:00:33,464 --> 01:00:35,549
Let's get out of here, together.

765
01:00:39,887 --> 01:00:42,890
