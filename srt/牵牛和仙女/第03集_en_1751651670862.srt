00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,450
THE LATE OH OK-SUN
CHIEF MOURNER: GRANDSON, BAE GYEON-U

2
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,080
STANDARD ROOM

3
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,920
Don't you dare mess with him.

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,290
He's mine.

5
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,960
You don't scare me.

6
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,930
Why not?

7
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,930
Because the really scary person

8
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:35,680
is sitting right behind me.

9
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,020
Gyeon-U.

10
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,390
Can you do something about that glare?

11
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,440
Excuse me.

12
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,770
Mr. Bae. A moment, please.

13
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,900
Oh, sure.

14
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,740
He has me on tenterhooks.

15
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:59,200
I wouldn't mind the deathly glare
if I'd actually done something horrible.

16
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,960
But I'm protecting him here.

17
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,250
He has no clue.

18
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,750
Ma'am. Your grandson's a bit ungrateful.

19
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:10,010
Just wait
until I ward off your misfortune.

20
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,630
I'll make sure you make up
for all of it with love.

21
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,890
She must've been a bad person.

22
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,270
-There are no visitors.
-I know, right?

23
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:23,230
You see, you must order
a minimum of 30 portions of food.

24
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,310
In that case…

25
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,360
19 CONTACTS

26
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,980
Is 19 people too few?

27
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,820
However few visitors you have,
you must order 30 portions of food.

28
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,530
Okay.

29
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,540
Enjoy the meal.

30
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,340
It's my first time at a funeral.

31
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,380
What am I supposed to do?

32
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,550
SPIRIT-MOTHER

33
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:03,890
MY DARLING SPIRIT-DAUGHTER

34
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,770
POWER OFF

35
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,860
The person you have called
is not available.

36
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,070
You'll be connected to voicemail.

37
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,650
How could she hang up like that?

38
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,070
Who can I call other than Mother?

39
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,460
PARK SEONG-A

40
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,790
Jeil Funeral Hall,
Standard Room, Oh Ok-sun.

41
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,590
Come if you have time.

42
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,960
Gyeon-U's grandmother passed away.

43
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,310
It's a nasty energy, all right.

44
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,100
But it's not so bad to anger the spirits.

45
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,230
DIVINE PUNISHMENT FOR A FORBIDDEN ACT

46
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,190
Maybe you're being dramatic,
Village Chief.

47
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,860
People have died.

48
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,490
Three people died in this house already.

49
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:57,030
Houses in other villages
sell for hundreds of millions of won.

50
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,280
Why do you think
house prices here are frozen?

51
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,950
You're our only hope, General Dongcheon.

52
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,750
Don't worry. I'm good at this.

53
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,080
Big Sister, are you ready?

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,130
Let's go.

55
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:01,050
-Put the lights down. Let's begin.
-Yes, ma'am.

56
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:25,990
Mom.

57
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,750
Mom…

58
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,870
Oh, Mom.

59
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,130
How could this be, Mom?

60
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,880
You sold off all the wealth you had

61
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,430
and ended up penniless.

62
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,760
What's this, Mom?

63
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:48,600
You could've at least put
some flowers around her photo.

64
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,640
The armband.

65
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,860
If you go to the office
by the main entrance…

66
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,940
-I'll go get you one.
-Give me yours.

67
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,700
What is it?
Can't give up the chief mourner role?

68
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,580
You're being ridiculous.

69
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,500
That won't change anything now.

70
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,330
If you had wanted to kick him out,

71
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,500
you should've done so long ago.

72
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,050
When I said

73
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,840
we should send him abroad
or anywhere else,

74
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:26,300
before Mom spent
her remaining savings on him!

75
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,600
Don't you remember
how much she hated that idea?

76
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,680
I do remember!
But you should've persuaded her somehow.

77
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,100
You're the eldest son, aren't you?

78
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,770
Honey. You too, stop it.

79
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,320
Please calm down, will you?

80
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,150
Come on. Hand it over!

81
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,910
Don't touch him. He's bad luck!

82
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,740
I'm sorry, Uncle. But please…

83
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,040
Could you let me stay here?

84
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,040
Who are you calling "Uncle"? Why you…

85
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,580
What do you think you're doing?
It's disrespectful.

86
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,790
What?

87
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,840
Why kick him out
when he's stayed here until now?

88
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,710
You want the world to know
how messed up your family is?

89
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,840
Do you think being loud
means you're right?

90
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,470
Are you a shaman?

91
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,550
Yes.

92
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,060
-My gosh.
-What?

93
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,100
-So what?
-A shaman?

94
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:15,480
A shaman at a funeral?
Don't you know shamans can't be here?

95
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,770
How dare you act like
she's a ghost already?

96
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,190
You called this con artist, didn't you?

97
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,440
-No, it's not what--
-You stay out of it.

98
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,820
Must you defame her
even on her final journey?

99
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,240
-Fine. Today's the day.
-I'd rather take on a ghost.

100
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,540
People are much worse.

101
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,330
-Come with me.
-Leave him alone.

102
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,980
Big Sister.

103
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,520
Isn't it a bit weird?

104
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,040
Dongcheon!

105
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,430
Gwi, as in "ghost."

106
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:16,430
It's a curse! Get out this instant!

107
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,850
A PUNISHMENT FOR ANGERING SPIRITS

108
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,690
Get out now!

109
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,820
A GHOST

110
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,460
You're still here?

111
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,540
TO BLOCK

112
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,000
THE LATE OH OK-SUN IN STANDARD ROOM
HAS BEEN MOVED TO SPECIAL SUITE 2

113
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,710
STANDARD ROOM

114
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,590
Hello. Thank you for coming.

115
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,720
How unfortunate.

116
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,780
Just say thank you.

117
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,330
It's the perfect time to say that.

118
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,450
Thank you.

119
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,840
How did you know to come?

120
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,710
Seong-A told me.

121
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,210
Seong-A?

122
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,840
Park Seong-A?

123
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,470
So, the thing is,

124
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,300
she works part-time in this area.

125
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,180
She saw you and told me to come.

126
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,100
She should be clocking out soon.

127
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,860
Get changed
and join us like you just arrived.

128
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,020
GET CHANGED AND JOIN US
LIKE YOU JUST ARRIVED

129
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,860
I don't have other clothes.

130
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,200
Hey, Gyeon-U.

131
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,080
Your parents…

132
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,240
They'll be here soon.

133
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,710
I'll leave. Don't worry.

134
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,870
Will you?

135
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,550
Thanks.

136
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,010
-You'll leave? For real?
-Yeah.

137
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,810
See you.

138
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:09,270
Bye. Get some rest.

139
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,770
You look like a mess.

140
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,860
CONDOLENCES

141
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,870
You didn't stop him. I thought you would.

142
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,080
You heard what the man said.

143
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,250
"Thanks."

144
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,590
Of all the things
people said to Gyeon-U today,

145
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,550
that was the one nice thing.

146
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,300
You can't stop him then.

147
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,220
About earlier.

148
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,350
I wouldn't have been mistreated so badly
if I hadn't been a shaman, right?

149
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,350
You would've been.

150
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,600
Because we're nothing but noobs.

151
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,990
Hey, Shaman. Can you get home on your own?

152
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,910
-Sure.
-See you tomorrow.

153
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,550
You'll return my money and that's it?

154
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,630
You said you could do this.

155
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,390
That was before I got hit by a curse.

156
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,100
It's a miracle
that only three have died so far.

157
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,810
Even ghosts would perish here.

158
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,520
You and your excuses. You're just a quack.

159
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,610
Watch it.

160
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,660
Don't call another shaman
to try to exorcise the ghost.

161
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,700
Whoever offers to do it
would be the real quack.

162
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,870
Here's your money.

163
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:55,550
What am I to do if even a rite won't work?

164
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,710
If it's hiding
its murderous energy so well,

165
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,590
it means it's
an exceptionally strong spirit.

166
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,100
Until the spirit moves away on its own,

167
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,100
there's nothing us humans can do.

168
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,270
All we can do is pray.

169
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,850
"Drive out the darkness."

170
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,230
"Let go of the evil within."

171
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,360
Just pray.

172
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,690
Are you all burned yet?

173
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:29,910
Don't let anyone near the house.

174
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,120
We'll see if we can find a solution.

175
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,330
Okay.

176
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,960
Let's head back, then.

177
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,130
-Okay.
-Let's go.

178
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,840
-Pack your stuff.
-Okay.

179
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,300
Hello.

180
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,380
Hi.

181
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,010
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

182
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:34,940
What a shame.

183
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,020
The bike's new.

184
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,090
What was that noise?

185
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:06,430
Is there an accident?

186
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,100
-A kid was hit!
-I think a child was hit.

187
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,060
-Someone call an ambulance.
-Call 119!

188
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:12,850
-Was it an accident?
-Hurry.

189
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:13,930
Oh, no.

190
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,070
You don't have to walk me further.

191
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:24,610
Get going now.

192
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:26,860
Okay, then.

193
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:27,950
I'm off.

194
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,790
What's wrong?

195
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,880
What?

196
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:45,840
It's nothing.

197
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,940
I heard your grandmother passed away.

198
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,940
She's finally free from you.

199
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:07,650
Congratulations.

200
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,130
I know you gave fake amulets
to my spirit-mother.

201
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,050
I won't tell on you. Make me 100 more…

202
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,760
No, make me just 50 more.

203
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,090
Are you some thief?

204
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,550
-Please.
-I can't make you any more.

205
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:33,010
I sent you a link instead. Check it out.

206
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:37,980
EPISODE 1. FLOWER MASTER'S
LIFESAVING AMULETS

207
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,060
What's this?

208
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,560
I started an online lecture series
on amulets.

209
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:43,810
It's 500,000 won per month,

210
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,480
but a 12-month plan is
5.4 million, with a 10% discount.

211
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:47,860
Are you some thief?

212
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,360
Oh, please. Call me entrepreneurial.

213
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,490
Hey, kiddo.

214
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,830
Aren't you
General Dongcheon's spirit-daughter?

215
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,870
Don't you know she's no ordinary shaman?

216
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,580
If she helped you become a shaman,
you must be pretty powerful too.

217
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,750
Why's a tiger cub harassing a fox?

218
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,250
Don't you call me again.

219
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,340
Bye-bye.

220
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,200
I'm sorry, Gyeon-U.

221
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,240
I'm sorry I upset you, Gyeon-U.

222
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,040
My grandson

223
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:43,080
is plagued with misfortune.

224
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:47,670
Please save my grandson's life.

225
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,220
How could this be, Mom?

226
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,300
THE LATE OH OK-SUN

227
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,100
How did you end up like this?

228
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,850
If you had wanted to kick him out,

229
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,720
you should've done so long ago.

230
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:03,730
Before Mom spent
her remaining savings on him!

231
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:25,420
I'm sorry…

232
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,760
for being the source
of your misfortune, Grandma.

233
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,140
Are you okay? You took a hit earlier.

234
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,390
It stung a bit.

235
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,560
It jolted me awake.

236
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,770
You really are a strong shaman.

237
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,730
I wonder who the crazy bitch is.

238
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,950
She offered herself as a living sacrifice
to strengthen an evil spirit.

239
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,700
BOOK ON THE SECRETS
OF THWARTING EVIL

240
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:42,490
She should've known better
than to use those vile spells.

241
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,620
It could cost her life.

242
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:48,120
"I'll cut a long lock of hair short
and pull out nails."

243
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,800
"I'll write a secret spell with blood

244
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,170
and become a shaman
serving an evil spirit."

245
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:10,730
"A spell that promises the evil spirit
to go to hell with it."

246
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,860
A GHOST

247
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,780
Whoever did this, she's not a human being.

248
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,660
It's a ghost in a shell of a human being.

249
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,870
How could you, Mother?

250
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,080
How could you ignore my call?

251
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:29,670
What are you doing in the dark?

252
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,500
Great Aunt?

253
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:38,510
When greeting an elder,
you first say, "How are you?"

254
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,130
Where are your manners?

255
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,010
How are you?

256
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,060
Hello. I'm fine.

257
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,150
Do you know how much I needed your help?

258
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,980
Ring, ring, ring!

259
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,480
It wasn't just you, okay?

260
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,780
I needed help too.

261
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:02,030
Don't lie. Why would you need help?

262
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,120
I bet your clients called for help.

263
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,740
You always need to have the last word.

264
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,620
You two are still on great terms.

265
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:12,790
This is not funny, Great Aunt.

266
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,210
I'm facing a massive life crisis.

267
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,010
Goodness.

268
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:20,170
It's not just a crisis but a massive one?

269
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,630
Yes.

270
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:26,100
He's my first love.

271
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:31,850
How is that Gyeon-U's fault?
They should blame his misfortune.

272
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,480
But he must survive 21 days

273
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,940
to get an apology
from those nasty people or fight them.

274
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,280
There's no point if he dies before then.

275
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,990
Once I fight off his misfortune
and he becomes normal,

276
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,740
Gyeon-U won't be hated.
Actually, he'll be really loved.

277
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,280
Because he's the nicest ever.

278
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,580
Mother. Great Aunt.

279
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,120
Please help me.

280
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:55,580
I'm too unskilled yet to protect Gyeon-U.

281
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,210
Great Aunt, look…

282
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,590
I'm on my knees.

283
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:05,840
You fool.
You went on your knees just like that?

284
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:07,550
What else should I do?

285
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,680
I have no idea what to do.

286
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,770
-Do you like him a lot?
-I love him.

287
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:22,440
You should be the one
protecting what you value.

288
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,030
Weaklings lose out eventually.

289
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,320
BOOK ON THE SECRETS
OF THWARTING EVIL

290
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,490
Hang, as in "to defeat."

291
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,370
Ma, as in "evil."

292
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,540
Bi, as in "mysterious."

293
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,790
Seo, as in "writing."

294
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:40,460
"Writing on mysterious knowledge
of defeating evil."

295
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,260
"Book on The Secrets of Thwarting Evil."

296
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:48,050
It took me 30 minutes to read 4 letters.

297
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,470
It'll take me ten years
to read the whole thing.

298
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,730
I'll never finish it in my lifetime.

299
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,860
HANJA DICTIONARY

300
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,580
Wow, Seong-A.

301
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,040
What's gotten into you?
Why are you studying?

302
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,710
-Any good with hanja?
-I can barely read hangul.

303
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,260
Damn it.

304
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,630
What is it?

305
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,430
What is this antique?

306
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,430
It's a book full of secrets

307
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:36,730
that make you a damn powerful shaman
who can take on even the strongest ghosts.

308
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,020
They say a way to protect Gyeon-U

309
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:42,480
is written somewhere in this book.

310
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:49,450
It's too hard. I don't understand a thing.

311
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,290
Let's find another way, buddy.

312
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,710
TRAVELING AROUND KOREA

313
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,630
Gyeon-U will miss school, won't he?

314
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,930
Yeah. Wouldn't it be best for him
to be alone?

315
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:10,890
I guess.

316
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:14,470
He'd be bothered
if there's someone by his side.

317
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,520
Right.

318
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,390
My goodness.

319
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,980
Hello, kid with a nice build.

320
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,150
-Do me a favor.
-No, thanks.

321
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:27,490
I'm the archery team coach.
I have crazy strong arms.

322
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:29,990
He'd want to be left alone.

323
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,280
There should be no one by his side.

324
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:36,540
No.

325
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,790
Absolutely no one.

326
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:44,800
So,

327
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,630
you left something behind?

328
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:52,010
-Yeah. I'll leave as soon as I find it.
-No, wait.

329
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,220
Stay here. I'll get it.

330
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,300
No.

331
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,390
It's a thing girls use in secret.

332
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,150
So, have you eaten?

333
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:05,190
Shall we eat together if you haven't?
I have a pretty huge appetite.

334
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,610
My mother says

335
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,110
if you can lift a spoon,
you can chew and swallow.

336
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,150
That's what life is like.

337
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,240
You didn't even drink water
at the funeral.

338
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,030
Did you eat anything after you left?

339
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,500
At the funeral?

340
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,620
Were you there?

341
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,210
I didn't see you.

342
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,420
Ji-ho.

343
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:30,970
He filled me in.
I couldn't have been there.

344
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:32,840
I was so not there.

345
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:37,390
So, have you… Did you eat?

346
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:40,020
I'm great at rinsing rice.
Do you want to watch?

347
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,140
-No, thanks.
-Come on.

348
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,730
You'll change your mind

349
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,480
-if you see me do it.
-I won't.

350
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,320
Watch, at least.

351
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,320
If you can't find what you came for,
please get going.

352
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,320
Gyeon-U.

353
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:58,370
Gyeon-U, don't entertain such thoughts.

354
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,000
What thoughts?

355
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,290
Bad thoughts.

356
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:06,540
That you want to die.

357
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,090
That ghost

358
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,760
only comes to those
who have such thoughts.

359
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,850
Your grandmother would be sad…

360
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,110
to see you like this.

361
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,660
Please leave.

362
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,190
Hey, Park Seong-A.

363
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,940
Park Seong-A?

364
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,110
She was here?

365
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:17,610
Forget it.

366
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,660
What do you want?

367
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,080
The coach asked me
to give you the archery team room key.

368
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,960
I did what I was told to do. Bye.

369
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,260
HWAMOK HIGH SCHOOL

370
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:42,180
ARCHERY TEAM

371
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,980
Give me Yeomhwa's number.

372
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,740
Why do you have this?

373
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:58,280
-Give me her phone number.
-I don't have it.

374
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:01,700
She's a regular. You have her number!

375
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:03,910
I don't have it.

376
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,830
Goodness.

377
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,210
Here.

378
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,050
YEOMHWA

379
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:21,260
What kind of nonsense is this?

380
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,010
Well, she's…

381
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,270
She's awfully famous.

382
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,270
"Influenza"? That's what she is now.

383
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:32,440
She's the first shaman
to become so well-known.

384
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,690
She's so popular,
so her number's never disclosed.

385
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:39,610
If you tap on this and send a DM,

386
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,820
she replies.

387
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:42,570
Shall I do it for you?

388
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:46,500
Forget it.

389
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,630
Don't sell Yeomhwa anything.

390
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,210
You'll be punished.

391
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,600
Well done.

392
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,980
I thought I'd die before my time.

393
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,900
Didn't you say you'd meet Dongcheon soon?

394
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,230
Why did you even hide?

395
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,020
You could just meet here and talk.

396
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,240
Well…

397
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,530
I don't look pretty today.

398
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,330
I want to look so pretty
that she'll be stunned.

399
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:33,830
Will this make me look nicer?

400
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,090
What do you think?

401
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:41,170
Mother!

402
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,720
You kneel all the time now.

403
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:49,060
What is it now?

404
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,020
I need your help. There's no time.

405
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,350
BOOK ON THE SECRETS OF THWARTING EVIL

406
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:57,900
Hey, that's against the rules.

407
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:00,860
A Suicide Ghost is stuck to Gyeon-U.

408
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:07,740
It looks like he let it in only recently.
It doesn't follow him around yet.

409
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:10,580
You've delayed it by about two days, then.

410
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:14,000
But don't let your guard down.
Suicide Ghost is quick and quiet.

411
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:20,050
If it gets as close to him
as a noon-time shadow…

412
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,840
NOON-TIME: 11:30 A.M. TO 1:30 P.M.

413
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,360
He'll die.

414
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,820
He'll take his own life.

415
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,370
My gosh.

416
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:50,040
You and your damn first love.

417
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,700
It's a tough one.

418
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,510
Do you want to save him that badly?

419
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,970
-Yes.
-How about him?

420
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:08,010
Does he have a reason to live?

421
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,020
It's a Suicide Ghost.

422
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,810
First, he must want to live.

423
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:17,230
You wanting him to live isn't enough.

424
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:23,070
He might not know if he wants to live yet.

425
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:26,740
If you're too sad, that's the first thing
you become unsure of.

426
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:34,200
Make him want to live first.

427
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,620
Can you do that?

428
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,090
Yes. I'll try everything I can.

429
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,140
This is all I have to offer.

430
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,970
Oh, gosh. Thanks.

431
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,850
The framed folk paintings tell me

432
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,190
my mother-in-law kept her refined taste.

433
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,400
May I ask why you're here?

434
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,120
Well…

435
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,790
Here you go.

436
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,210
USONG COLUMBARIUM 2-28-501

437
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:21,000
Neither my wife nor her brother

438
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:23,460
had a single photo of their mother.

439
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,670
We had nothing to put next to her urn.

440
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:29,970
But now that's settled.

441
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:32,140
You have lots of photos here.

442
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,020
Thank you,

443
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,640
Uncle.

444
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,250
What's an amulet?

445
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:44,750
It's just a little piece of paper.

446
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:49,590
But what sets it apart
from other pieces of paper?

447
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,930
An amulet contains heart.

448
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:56,220
The determination to protect someone.

449
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,260
The hope that they will stay safe.

450
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:00,140
The well-wishes for their future.

451
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:04,520
Those are what fend off misfortune
and protect someone.

452
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:11,030
What if it were a human
instead of a piece of paper?

453
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,910
-A human?
-Humans are powerful.

454
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:20,700
They're warm.

455
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:25,790
"A Human Amulet."

456
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,050
This turns a person into an amulet.

457
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:31,670
Write on your body
instead of on a piece of paper,

458
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,760
stick close to him,

459
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,640
and share your warmth like this.

460
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,810
Then misfortune will be driven out.

461
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,480
We must hold hands?

462
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,270
You don't have to hold it.
You can brush his with yours.

463
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,990
Sharing your warmth is what's important.

464
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,570
-Mother.
-What?

465
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:00,370
Oh, right, he's your first love.

466
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,620
Are you too shy to touch him like this?

467
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,340
It's the best method, Mother.

468
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,260
Oh, my gosh. You little…

469
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:16,720
Wish me luck.

470
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:21,510
Why didn't you tell me
about the Human Amulet sooner?

471
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,440
I will save Gyeon-U

472
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:30,270
with my physical touch.

473
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:35,450
Gyeon-U!

474
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:41,030
Gyeon-U, long time no see.

475
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,950
Hey, it's great to see you.

476
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,040
Shall I read your palm?

477
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,870
I'm really good at it.

478
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,420
What now?

479
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,790
Should we bring out the child in him?

480
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:55,210
Hi.

481
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:56,970
Hi.

482
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:09,060
Hi.

483
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:17,780
That's too close.

484
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:26,000
Have you eaten?

485
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,790
Did you sleep well?

486
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,340
Gyeon-U, sit with me.

487
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:45,680
Is this necessary?

488
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,150
-Then…
-Unnecessarily clingy.

489
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,230
Hey, Ji-ho, morning to you too.

490
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,700
Did you study last night?

491
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:07,370
You're acting real strange.

492
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,790
What was that?

493
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,420
What?

494
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:14,750
Here.

495
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:17,380
Guess which finger I poked you with.

496
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,510
Go on.

497
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,970
-This one.
-Wrong.

498
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,850
This one.

499
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,560
It's too early for that.

500
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,570
Why did I use this finger?

501
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,110
Guys, you're mistaken.

502
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,240
That was me trying

503
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,280
to bring out the child in you.

504
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,750
You're no better than a tabloid hack.

505
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,540
Didn't I tell you to look into it
before spreading a rumor?

506
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:59,380
-Exactly.
-I'm a victim of fake news too.

507
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:02,590
Now that's the downside of mass media.

508
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,180
What's going on here?

509
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,390
Why are you sulking?

510
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:09,350
Our poor Gyeon-U
almost got framed because of him.

511
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,020
-Him, an arsonist? How ridiculous.
-Right.

512
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,730
I went to ask our math teacher
for help with a problem.

513
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,270
What?

514
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,730
An arsonist?

515
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:21,860
You bought that stupid rumor
and made the kid write a report?

516
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,070
It's not like that, Coach Yang.

517
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:28,410
Spare me your excuses.
Why would Gyeon-U set a fire?

518
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:31,040
Why would he set fire to the storage?

519
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:34,750
The only thing he sets fire to
are the girls' hearts.

520
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:37,340
I must say he set fire to mine too.

521
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:40,210
In the end, our homeroom teacher
apologized to the archery coach.

522
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,550
I told you to watch what you say.

523
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:47,720
I'm not the only one in the wrong.
You spread rumors too.

524
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,430
Not again. Watch your tongue.

525
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:50,720
Did you forget already?

526
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:54,980
Well, Gyeon-U even missed school
for a few days because of that.

527
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,810
I feel so terrible about it

528
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,900
that I don't know what to say.

529
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,570
He didn't miss school because of you.

530
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,740
Gyeon-U's grandmother passed away.

531
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,410
That's why he missed school.

532
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,830
Put your face down on your desk.

533
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,080
-You idiot.
-Seriously.

534
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,080
-You should've been careful.
-Smack him.

535
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:20,090
It made no sense.

536
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,300
I'm glad you're not
being mistaken anymore.

537
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,420
Show some remorse.

538
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,640
Tap my hand again.

539
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:36,730
Stronger this time.

540
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:48,740
Well done.

541
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,240
-Let me help you.
-What?

542
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,210
I'll do it. Why are you doing this?

543
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:57,670
-Hey, wait.
-Hey.

544
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:01,460
Gyeon-U, where were you?

545
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,340
Why is there so much dust?

546
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:05,670
-What…
-Look at all this.

547
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,570
I'm sorry.

548
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,240
Oh, my gosh.

549
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,620
Thank you. You got it for me.

550
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:40,920
What are you doing to Gyeon-U?
Is it a new way of bullying?

551
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,750
It's not.

552
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,880
Would you like it
if someone kept doing this to you?

553
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,010
That's not what I did.

554
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,220
I know that.

555
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,470
You did this.

556
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:57,890
I'm not bullying him.

557
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,650
What an interesting method.
A person can be an amulet?

558
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:03,360
So when I touch him like that,

559
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,860
it's not just for my own greed.

560
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,820
The determination to save Gyeon-U.

561
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:13,070
With that pure intention,
I'm willingly sacrificing myself

562
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,160
to save a life, okay?

563
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,620
There's no ulterior motive.

564
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,960
Stop it. It looks like you totally
have an ulterior motive.

565
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:21,460
Does it?

566
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:26,340
Does it have to be so hard?

567
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,340
Can't you just tell him everything
and offer to help?

568
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,300
No. You saw what it's like.

569
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,340
Me being a shaman
puts Gyeon-U in a tight spot.

570
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:37,810
To accept my help, he must trust me.

571
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:39,600
A shaman at a funeral?

572
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:43,190
Must you defame her
even on her final journey?

573
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,110
I can't make things
even more difficult for Gyeon-U.

574
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,240
So what?

575
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,570
You'll become a weirdo for him?

576
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:54,950
Yeah.

577
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:57,490
I may not get him to understand,
but I can protect him.

578
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,500
If I have no choice
but to be hated by him, so be it.

579
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,000
I'll just focus on
what I can do right now.

580
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,750
Hey.

581
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:09,670
You sound like

582
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,840
you're being genuine.

583
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,350
Hey.

584
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:18,260
I am being genuine.

585
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:21,180
I'm genuinely a shaman, punk.

586
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:54,300
What are you doing?

587
00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:00,220
-How far will you follow me?
-What?

588
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:02,060
Oh, well…

589
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:05,770
-Until you catch me?
-I just caught you, though.

590
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:10,900
This is the opposite direction
of where you live.

591
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,900
I'm not going home.

592
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:15,030
Where are you going?

593
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:18,530
To the columbarium.

594
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,450
Gyeon-U.

595
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,080
Your grandmother…

596
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:06,790
She must've been really competitive.

597
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:14,050
A bouquet of flowers won't make her smile.

598
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,340
She only smiles when you put
a gold medal around her neck.

599
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:21,680
She's a total gold medal hunter.

600
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:42,320
You've got this, right?

601
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:43,990
-Look at mommy.
-I'll get you something yummy.

602
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,870
WE WELCOME THE FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS

603
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,250
Let's eat something tasty.

604
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:54,500
GYEONGGI YEOUN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

605
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:55,920
You have to beat your classmates.

606
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:57,720
-Here. Rock-paper-scissors.
-Rock-paper-scissors.

607
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,580
NATIONAL ARCHERY COMPETITION

608
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:25,870
Congratulations.

609
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:26,950
Thanks.

610
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:36,670
Grandma.

611
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,380
So you were happy that day.

612
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:45,510
That made you happy.

613
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:50,770
I'm glad.

614
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:40,940
JOONGHYUN HIGH SCHOOL
ARCHERY TEAM BAE GYEON-U

615
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:42,400
When did he…

616
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,200
Three,

617
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:34,660
two,

618
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:36,830
one.

619
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,630
For this practical assessment,

620
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:28,930
you're to pick a key theme
from the chapters of Life and Ethics

621
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:31,470
and come up with a program
to improve awareness on that topic.

622
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:33,600
We're all in the same group.

623
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,680
PARK SEONG-A, BAE GYEON-U

624
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:37,100
I'll give you ten minutes.

625
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,560
Pick a group leader

626
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,810
and if possible,
decide who will give the presentation

627
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,360
so you don't fight later on.

628
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,690
I'll lead our group. No objections, right?

629
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:48,280
No. You've already taken
the leader's seat too.

630
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:50,070
-Hey.
-What?

631
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:53,030
-You be the leader.
-Me?

632
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,290
And you're the assistant leader.

633
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:57,500
But we don't need one.

634
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:01,750
-Do you want a beating or not?
-Not.

635
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:04,340
So just do as I say, okay?

636
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,130
They're screwed.

637
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:08,880
And I'm screwed too.

638
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:17,060
Do-yeon.

639
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:19,850
Why do you have such a nasty thing
clinging to you?

640
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,810
-You're putting my Gyeon-U in danger.
-You do it, then.

641
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,270
The Three Ominous Ghosts.

642
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:27,360
There are three types of ghosts
you must avoid.

643
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,240
Smiling Ghosts, Dancing Ghosts,

644
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:32,070
and Baby Ghosts.

645
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,030
What do you think they have in common?

646
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:35,910
They're all fine being on their own?

647
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:38,450
That's kind of right.

648
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:39,710
To be exact,

649
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:42,170
those three ghosts don't complain.

650
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:46,130
Most other ghosts move on
when they're consoled,

651
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:47,500
but not them.

652
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:48,800
You can't reason with them.

653
00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:53,090
You can't talk to them
if they're not reasonable at all.

654
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,140
But you need to talk to them

655
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,180
to help them cross over, right?

656
00:50:58,270 --> 00:51:01,480
Then the Baby Ghost
will be the most troublesome.

657
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,640
It can't talk at all.

658
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:04,560
That's right.

659
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:06,860
That's the worst of the three.

660
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:10,940
I can barely handle a Suicide Ghost,
and there's a Baby Ghost too?

661
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:18,370
What should I do, then?

662
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:19,620
You can wait.

663
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:23,710
Sorry.

664
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:25,670
What's up with her?

665
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,420
Ji-ho, you and I will do the research.

666
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,300
Gyeon-U!

667
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:36,760
Gyeon-U!

668
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:40,930
You came to the archery field.

669
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:44,390
Yeah, just because.

670
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,020
How did it feel to shoot after a while?

671
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,360
Did it feel like second nature?

672
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,070
Are you getting back into archery?

673
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:51,280
No, I'm not.

674
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,240
Come on.

675
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:58,240
You should've cleaned up after yourself.

676
00:51:58,330 --> 00:52:00,080
You can't just leave like that!

677
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:02,160
-I cleaned--
-Come with me, punk.

678
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:04,580
Clean up before you go. Follow me.

679
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,380
-But I--
-Follow me, I said.

680
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,550
Mop every corner, okay?

681
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:14,840
Under that desk too.

682
00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:18,470
Gyeon-U.

683
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:23,140
Isn't archery just amazing?

684
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:27,520
I'm not saying
you should get back into it.

685
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:30,230
Well…

686
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:32,030
You know,

687
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:37,160
girls dumped me left and right
when I was young.

688
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:40,330
I never got why, but they did.

689
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:41,830
But you know,

690
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,500
girls who rejected me

691
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:47,880
with a short, sharp, "I don't like you,"
stuck in my mind forever.

692
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:50,290
"I should've said this to her face."

693
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:52,710
"I should've made her
pay me back for the handbag."

694
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,010
"I'd paid 2.5 million won for it
at a duty-free store."

695
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:58,890
Those girls appear in my dreams even now.

696
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:01,310
I can never forget them.

697
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:02,430
But think about this.

698
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:05,810
"This is what I don't like about you."

699
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:09,650
"This is why I don't think
we're a good match."

700
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:11,770
Girls who cared enough
to put in the effort

701
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:14,150
to explain before the break-up?

702
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:16,030
I didn't think of them ever again.

703
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:18,240
"Oh, yes. That happened."

704
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:20,910
"There was that girl." And that's it.

705
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:28,920
You were with this bow for ten years.

706
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:32,920
Even if you want to break up,
put time and effort into it.

707
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:35,380
Here.

708
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:38,380
That way, you'll have no regrets.

709
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,900
Who is that?

710
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:57,530
You don't know Bae Gyeon-U?
The best in the high school division.

711
00:53:57,610 --> 00:53:59,450
He must've decided to come back.

712
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:05,580
-He's good.
-Agreed.

713
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,580
He's so cool.

714
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:17,380
He's awesome.

715
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:44,830
I see he really likes archery.

716
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:48,700
What a relief.

717
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:56,250
Here's a special tip
just for my Flower Fam.

718
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:58,090
When you're plagued by a Baby Ghost,

719
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:00,760
most shamans will sell you
a Protective Amulet.

720
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,470
But would Baby Ghosts know what that is?

721
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:04,550
No, no.

722
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:05,680
They'd have no clue.

723
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,010
So, Protective Amulets?

724
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:10,020
I don't use them.

725
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:11,810
I go for wish-granting ones.

726
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,560
Baby Ghosts only leave

727
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:16,900
when you wish for the good
of both you and them.

728
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:20,820
You must make an amulet with a kind heart.

729
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,200
Like who? Just like me.

730
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,160
Wish-Granting Amulet, ready.

731
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,960
I'll put it in Do-yeon's desk drawer
tomorrow to console the Baby Ghost.

732
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:36,130
Suicide Ghost.

733
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:37,630
Just you wait.

734
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:44,840
KU DO-YEON

735
00:55:56,730 --> 00:55:57,730
My goodness.

736
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:00,190
Oh. Hey.

737
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,030
You got here really early.

738
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:10,410
Good morning.

739
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:13,160
Hi.

740
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:14,920
Are you off to shoot some arrows?

741
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:20,840
-No.
-I know that's what you're off to do.

742
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,510
You absolutely love archery.

743
00:56:28,970 --> 00:56:30,390
We should talk.

744
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:33,890
Don't you think
you're following me around too much?

745
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,560
Oh, yeah? I don't think so.

746
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:39,440
Why are you following me around?

747
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:40,610
Don't do that.

748
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:44,440
I'm not following you around.
You just happen to be everywhere I go.

749
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:46,660
Do you call that an excuse…

750
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:49,200
I see it didn't work.

751
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:56,330
I want to ask you something. Can I?

752
00:56:57,670 --> 00:56:59,750
-Yeah.
-About archery.

753
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,880
How does it make you feel
when you shoot the arrow?

754
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,130
That's him.

755
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:08,260
The haunted kid.

756
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:10,550
-Yes. He causes the accidents.
-The accidents were all him.

757
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:11,810
I heard.

758
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:13,680
-Because of him…
-Will something happen today?

759
00:57:13,770 --> 00:57:15,390
That kid suffered too.

760
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,440
-So what if he's great?
-Three.

761
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,060
-The other kids suffer.
-Two.

762
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:22,070
Something happened on the bus last time.

763
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:23,190
One.

764
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,040
He's good, I guess.

765
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:46,720
I feel good.

766
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:49,260
However strong the wind blows…

767
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:56,270
I can beat it with a single arrow.

768
00:57:58,890 --> 00:57:59,900
That's cool.

769
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:01,730
And I'm proud of you.

770
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,220
You want to know why I follow you around?

771
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:32,260
Kids should be protected by adults,
but you protect yourself.

772
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:35,430
That's why I want to be nice to you.

773
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:37,020
Can I do that?

774
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:39,770
Is it pity?

775
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,770
It's friendship.

776
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:47,780
Come on.

777
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:50,240
You'll change your mind
if you see me do it.

778
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,320
Guess which finger I poked you with.

779
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:54,410
Go on.

780
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:56,830
Well done.

781
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:06,420
I'm sorry.

782
00:59:29,230 --> 00:59:30,820
-Hey, Gyeon-U.
-What?

783
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:31,900
High-five.

784
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:34,570
-Right now?
-Yeah, right now.

785
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:37,530
Sure, I guess.

786
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:38,910
Come on. Hurry.

787
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:32,050
First love.

788
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:34,800
Here we go.

789
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:14,300
SPECIAL THANKS TO OH MIN-AE

790
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,050
Hi. Good morning.

791
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,630
The weather's lovely.

792
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:20,430
What's he doing instead of archery?

793
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,760
Romance is in the air, I see.

794
01:01:21,850 --> 01:01:25,020
From now on, nothing bad will ever happen.

795
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:27,020
Because I'll ward it all off.

796
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,810
This is what's bad
about being in a group of three.

797
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:30,560
I feel left out.

798
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:32,860
-Let's talk.
-About what?

799
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:35,780
-I have to dash to my part-time job.
-I'll walk you.

800
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:38,110
This boundary was made with the purpose
of making the one inside

801
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,360
an evil deity.

802
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:40,490
I found you.

803
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:43,370
You, the mask on your face.
Can you take it off for a moment?

804
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:51,710
