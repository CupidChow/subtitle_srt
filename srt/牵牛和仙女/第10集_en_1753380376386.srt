1
00:01:10,196 --> 00:01:12,239
You're not Gyeonwu, Bongsu

2
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:15,868
Seong-ah, why are you so scary?

3
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:19,246
Bongsu, what about Gyeonwu?

4
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,209
Where is Gyeonwu?

5
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:29,632
This guy's body is completely
Tell me how I can have it

6
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:31,759
Skin care

7
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:34,595
Just look at the blood

8
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,263
I got involved with a ghost

9
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,071
Oh, that would be perfect for a suicide note

10
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:00,955
Sorry

11
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,796
Sangmoon needs to see blood
Sangmoon Lee

12
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:09,797
uh?

13
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,008
Seong-ah, let's go

14
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:14,677
wait for a sec

15
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,011
hey

16
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:18,848
He said he would take care of the shaman

17
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:20,724
Would it be okay if I left the suicide ghost alone?

18
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,184
- hey
- no!

19
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,270
Let go of this!

20
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,154
Gyeonwooya

21
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:38,450
Gyeonwu!

22
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:12,109
Gyeonwoo, are you okay?

23
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:19,575
Yeah

24
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:21,410
It's okay

25
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:24,663
Thank goodness

26
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:29,793
No, but

27
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:37,593
No, but
I don't think you're okay

28
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:38,761
uh?

29
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,850
Oh, I see

30
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:47,186
You want a bike?

31
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,271
Yeah, just for today

32
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:54,234
Seong-ah is very sick
I'm just trying to take you home

33
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:56,612
Really? Then I'll take you.

34
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:57,613
noâ€¦

35
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:02,409
Wait a minute, Seong-ah

36
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:04,745
- hey!
- Hey, Mr.

37
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,622
When I say it, I ask you to give it to me

38
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:07,957
You haven't said it yet
Did you do it with your feet?

39
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,249
Oh, I don't know!

40
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,668
Just give it to me!

41
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,086
Bongsu, don't do it

42
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,588
Gyeonwoo, our hands
Let's just keep holding on

43
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,260
Jihoya

44
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:23,097
Bongsu is a much worse kid than I thought

45
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:25,140
Because I don't know what to do

46
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:26,475
Let's just hurry up and get the bikesâ€¦

47
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,103
Runner

48
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,359
hi

49
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,029
right

50
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:41,490
I was a fool

51
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:54,878
ruler

52
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:01,510
Bongsuya

53
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:04,013
Where is Gyeonwu?

54
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:06,598
I

55
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,644
I ate it

56
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,881
Cursing me

57
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:42,926
I need to have my stuff
I'm not going to curse

58
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,352
thing?

59
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,882
Why do you drink alcohol

60
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,511
Are you not getting drunk?

61
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,196
Poor thing, my friend

62
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,807
Don't pity me, my friend.

63
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,222
What are you doing? What are you looking for?

64
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,147
What about the silver ring?

65
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,649
Has it already been returned to its original owner?

66
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,944
What does that have to do with you?
Is this your stuff?

67
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:12,743
how is it?

68
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:15,412
I feel like Sangmoon has taken over my body

69
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,498
Speak quietly, you're sleeping

70
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,502
But where are you going?
Why are you dressed up like this?

71
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,796
Come right away

72
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:28,550
Come quickly, don't come

73
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,010
Don't come

74
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,983
No, but
What are you trying to do now?

75
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:47,569
uh?

76
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:07,839
Are you going to leave it like this?

77
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,010
For now

78
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:14,763
You need to know the direction you are flying

79
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:16,640
Let's put the net over there.

80
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:22,062
This is Gokmasan
This is the retirement that Bodhisattva Park used

81
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:25,565
Who is the one possessed by the ghost?
Break it so quickly

82
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,234
I had a hard time finding it

83
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,611
Originally, the rich kids
I don't have time

84
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,245
One, ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand

85
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:39,830
Hundred thousand, one million, ten million

86
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,749
Yes, thank you, yes

87
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,043
What else do you want?
Are you not here, customer?

88
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:47,504
No, thank you for your hard work.

89
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:51,174
I guess you made up well with Dongcheon
This is Dongcheon

90
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:53,927
What you bought me here 10 years ago

91
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:55,804
mom

92
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:58,515
This is totally my mom's, huh?

93
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,143
Butterfly you suit me

94
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:02,561
Look, look, look

95
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:05,772
Oh, my mom is pretty

96
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:10,569
They were really pretty back then, oh my

97
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,742
Oh my god, what the heck is this? Huh?

98
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:19,828
Why are you putting a mask in the garden where butterflies play?

99
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:21,830
Is this Dongcheon's work?

100
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:26,084
Eugh, sense, really

101
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,338
The mask symbolizes the wall.

102
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:32,632
I guess there was a ghost you wanted to chase away

103
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,679
maybe

104
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,058
Butterfly ghost?

105
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,191
I know I did something wrong

106
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:51,026
I don't want to give it back

107
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:54,196
How did you know how to steal a body? Yeomhwa

108
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,906
It's obvious what he's thinking, you know

109
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,575
After killing Gyeonwu
I'm not trying to create a devil

110
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,661
But first, to do that, what is that?

111
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:03,622
Because I have to take over all of Gyeonwoo's body

112
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:05,499
They told me right away

113
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,918
But that's it, huh?

114
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,545
I'm really with that guy
We're not in the same boat anymore

115
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:12,798
I want to live as a human being

116
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,466
Oh, so what should we do with the chloride?

117
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:15,634
Just block it

118
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,761
I already blocked it once

119
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,514
I'm not originally from that abandoned house
It was embedded in the object

120
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,225
But I
As soon as I heard the news that the body had been taken over

121
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,685
Where is that thing?
You're asking me

122
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,562
I didn't tell you

123
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:28,980
He just changed the subject

124
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,316
I did say something a little scary

125
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,610
When I scare you again
It's definitely a scary style

126
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:36,446
I told you I have no intention of becoming an evil spirit, okay?

127
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,490
Do you understand my heart now?

128
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,495
Say something, old shaman.

129
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:54,131
Haunted Object

130
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,509
You found a ghost?

131
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:00,595
Chlorine

132
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:04,266
I'm looking for the treasure that the beacon was holding

133
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:09,020
Break the ghost
I'm planning on calling the grim reaper

134
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:13,108
Bongsu is in Gyeonwu's body
Because I don't want to come out

135
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:16,486
Forced to take care of the cowherd
I'm trying to send you to the afterlife

136
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:18,947
Then what should I do?

137
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:22,451
First, we have to guard the beacon

138
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:25,620
Then what about Gyeonwoo?

139
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:29,040
If you get caught by the grim reaper
Gyeonwu is lost forever

140
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,835
Guarding the beacon
Protecting the cowherd

141
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,882
Any other way?
Is there no other way?

142
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:42,137
Because I want to live as a human being

143
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:47,934
I want to be by your side
They say he stole Gyeonwu's body

144
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:50,729
To my ears it's

145
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,607
I heard you say you want to be loved

146
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,029
Look into that heart carefully

147
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,989
Don't look at me so negatively

148
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:05,994
Daughter

149
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:07,746
What does our shaman do?

150
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:16,171
It's soothing

151
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:18,798
okay

152
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:22,427
Good and amulets are just means

153
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:24,304
The essence is in the mind

154
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:28,099
If you take good care of your wounded heart,

155
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:31,102
Everything goes according to plan
It's going to go well

156
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:34,064
still

157
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:36,775
It's taking too long

158
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:48,662
Still, we have to go the right way

159
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:16,064
hey

160
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:19,693
How did that go for you?

161
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:20,944
What, find a name?

162
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,321
What, did you find it?

163
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,782
Why are you suddenly interested?

164
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,118
What did the old shaman say?

165
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:32,872
just

166
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:34,749
I want you to do well

167
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,794
If you live, Gyeonwu will live too

168
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:44,134
Will you do it well?

169
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,595
huh

170
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:52,183
What, howâ€¦

171
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:56,062
How can I help you?

172
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:02,485
Don't be lonely

173
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,282
When you're lonely, everyone becomes a ghost.

174
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:21,796
Gyeonwoo, I'll make it right

175
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,424
Until then please

176
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:27,135
Stay safe

177
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:38,229
hey!

178
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:40,940
Is there no one?

179
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,236
I don't even know where it is

180
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:47,447
There is no road

181
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,083
Is that a crying sound?

182
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:08,718
yap

183
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:12,389
Hey, what's wrong? Look at the kids.

184
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,974
You said you would do well

185
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,188
I think they're dating

186
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,777
Wow, that's amazing, it looks like rice cake

187
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,154
You said you would do well

188
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:40,667
Well, to lean your chin on
It's just the right height, I like it

189
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:42,293
Are you two dating?

190
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:45,964
No, I like it one-sidedly
It's unrequited love

191
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:47,882
What the heck, are you a real man?

192
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,259
hey!

193
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:53,388
I've been with Bongsu for too long
Are you starting to resemble Bongsu?

194
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,849
A little bit away
Why are you acting like a phoenix?

195
00:16:58,852 --> 00:16:59,853
Because it's a beacon

196
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:00,854
huh?

197
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,522
What is 'Huh?'

198
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:03,690
I'm Bongsu, Inma

199
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,360
That's not it

200
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:09,279
What about Gyeonwu? What is Gyeonwu's life like?

201
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,823
It's a thing where all your facial features are taken away
It's really rare

202
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,575
First of all, appeasing Bongsu is the priority.

203
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,911
Me too, starting today
I'm going to start the 100-day prayer

204
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:18,538
It takes 100 days?

205
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,041
I can't guarantee that either

206
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,753
If it doesn't take 100 days, it's 200 days
If it doesn't take 200 days, it's 300 days

207
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,547
You have to pray and coax them until it works out.

208
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:31,301
I can't wait that long

209
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:35,096
Hey, come in when I say it
Call Gyeonwoo quickly

210
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,432
Hey, you're the one who doesn't say anything
What are you doing with your hands right nowâ€¦

211
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:38,767
hey!

212
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:40,977
Don't joke around

213
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:47,650
Look at me, we're in the same group.

214
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:49,986
what?

215
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,154
I like you guys

216
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,655
I like shamans

217
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,824
I want to stay with you forever

218
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,872
But I'm trying to catch a shaman
If you reach out

219
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:02,582
Go back to the cowherd

220
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:04,501
Let's go home, Seong-ah

221
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,921
Even if he falls
I can't even wake you up

222
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:11,424
Even if you cry, I can't wipe your tears away

223
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:13,802
That's too much

224
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:15,804
It was painful

225
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:18,848
Really

226
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:32,153
Should we do the 100-day prayer together?

227
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:33,780
- Will it work, will it work?
- Okay, let's go!

228
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,448
okay!

229
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:37,867
You can't do it with the doctor? You lost?

230
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,203
- Oh, the game isn't working? Yeah, no.
- I looked at it, I looked at it

231
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,412
- I saw it, I saw it
- hey

232
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:45,667
Why! Why, why, what?

233
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:47,627
What about Park Sung-ah?

234
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,878
Park Sung-ah, why!

235
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,005
No, thatâ€¦

236
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:54,717
Please tell him I said thank you.

237
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,719
What fortune told me

238
00:18:57,846 --> 00:18:58,888
No mouth?

239
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:01,891
Oh, you say it yourself!
I don't feel like talking right now.

240
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,142
I'm depressed!

241
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:04,644
sad

242
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,776
Hey! Don't bother my friend!

243
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,403
- Huh? What is it?
- huh?

244
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:15,196
- Are you Joo Seung?
- uh?

245
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,573
Man, are you crazy?

246
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:18,116
Hey, we're friends.

247
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,161
Where is he?

248
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:23,872
Who is talking?

249
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:25,790
There was that guy back then, Hwamokgo!

250
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:26,749
hey!

251
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:29,210
what?

252
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:04,704
Wasn't it him then?

253
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,414
Harmony, harmony, harmony, harmony

254
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,209
What are you guys?

255
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:14,380
Are you hitting me?

256
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:18,343
hey

257
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:20,637
- hey
- Hey, wait a minuteâ€¦

258
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:24,807
Okay, okay
Okay, okay, I won't do it.

259
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:26,851
- This dog!
- hey!

260
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:28,686
- Hey, grab it! Grab it!
- Hey, grab it, oh my, for real

261
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,480
Why are you holding me! Why, why are you holding me!

262
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,107
- Hey, hold on tight.
- Let go, or not?

263
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:34,192
Let go!

264
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,576
Hey, guys, why did you stop me earlier?

265
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,078
I'm good at fighting

266
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:47,538
They're good at fighting too

267
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:51,876
Why are you guys getting hit?

268
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,545
Jinwoong shouldn't have an accident right now

269
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,547
why?

270
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:58,675
If you have an accident, your parents will be called.

271
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,635
He can't meet his mom right now

272
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:04,847
My mom removed me from the family register?

273
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:06,140
hey

274
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:07,225
I

275
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:09,727
I don't want to meet you to protect my mother

276
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:12,730
From my dad

277
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:33,126
Let's go home

278
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,031
- hey!
- huh

279
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:06,367
Why are you here now?

280
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:09,162
The construction was hectic, I was busy

281
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,582
You look so pretty today too

282
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,044
What are you talking about? Go into your room quickly.

283
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:18,755
for a moment

284
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:21,299
What is this? Blood?

285
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:23,217
Yeah, we fought

286
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,178
Did you fight?

287
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:28,014
Hey, what if you fight with your body?

288
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,515
The athlete
Don't you know you shouldn't fight?

289
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:30,767
What if you get hurt like that?

290
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:31,768
I won't fight

291
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,354
Oh, shaman, you know what?

292
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:36,981
what?

293
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:39,150
you

294
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,070
You're pretty even when you're angry

295
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:43,488
This is real

296
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:45,782
hey!

297
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:49,452
I'm so pissed, really

298
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,349
Where did he go again?

299
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:25,404
You're full of fighting spirit, from the morning, huh?

300
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:29,575
what?

301
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:31,577
You came from archery, right?

302
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:32,995
I have to, work hard

303
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:35,289
When it comes to archery, Bae Gyeon-woo
When you think of Baek Gyeon-woo, it's archery

304
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,209
Get out of the way, I'm having a hard time.

305
00:23:47,969 --> 00:23:49,720
What are you doing? Give it to me

306
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:53,683
Is this kid helping my girlfriend?

307
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:55,351
- hey
- Look at it

308
00:23:57,854 --> 00:23:58,813
hey

309
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:02,650
Why, what?

310
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,653
Eat this

311
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:08,573
Wow, this is really delicious.

312
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:10,908
- This is really delicious, really.
-Why is he like that?

313
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:13,077
Hey! Thanks, huh?

314
00:24:13,578 --> 00:24:15,288
It's so delicious

315
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:17,957
You're so happy with just one candy
Like a child

316
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,625
Hey, this is better than what I ate yesterday.
It's much tastier, man

317
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:21,294
thank you

318
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:24,630
Oh, it's delicious

319
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:28,801
But honestly, you were right too

320
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:31,053
What are you talking about
I gave it to you like a man

321
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:33,222
- Hey, hey, hey, that's not right.
- Be manly!

322
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:34,974
If it's going to be like this, let's arm wrestle

323
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,475
- Come to work
- Arm wrestling? Okay, call.

324
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,228
Hey, one pack, hey, one pack, come to work
Look at the referee, quick

325
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:41,105
- why
- You are the judge.

326
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:42,899
Okay, one, two, three and we're going.

327
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,734
One, two, three!

328
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:51,324
Has the mood changed?

329
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:54,660
Oh, did something become more attractive?

330
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:56,913
It looks comfortable
I want to become friends

331
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:58,539
Should we go to Konoha together?

332
00:24:58,623 --> 00:25:02,335
No, the one who finally became comfortable
Why are you trying to make me uncomfortable again?

333
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:05,129
Gyeonwoo, do you want to go to Kono together?

334
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:06,464
good!

335
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,926
- good
- Oh, what's wrong with Bae Gyeon-woo?

336
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:11,302
- It was good.
- Not you

337
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:13,054
- Besides me?
- Yeah, are you going?

338
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:15,514
- I'll do it later
- Let's go first.

339
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:16,766
Everybody

340
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:21,395
Bongsu is better than Gyeonwu
I think I like it better

341
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,914
You're digging, oh my

342
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:47,171
It's the same face
How can it be so different?

343
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,342
Because it's someone else

344
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,139
It's not that I don't like Bongsu

345
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:02,520
Things I would never do if I were Gyeonwu
Because you're doing whatever you want

346
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:03,646
It's refreshing

347
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:06,774
Oh my, it's cold, it's cold

348
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:10,778
however

349
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:13,281
however

350
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:18,452
The cowherd is not the cowherd
Because nobody knows

351
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,789
It's not just me

352
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:26,419
I'm afraid that Gyeonwu will be erased like this

353
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:30,548
I'm afraid I'll disappear from the real world

354
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:35,261
I miss you so much, Gyeonwoo

355
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:38,806
No, just call both of them

356
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:42,310
How can we meet without Gyeonwu?

357
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:44,812
Just call me at the time

358
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:46,772
- Yes?
- Congratulations

359
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:51,193
Oh, congratulations

360
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:00,536
Gyeonwooya

361
00:27:02,163 --> 00:27:03,706
Gyeonwoo, it's time to wake up

362
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,917
Hey, Gyeonwu?

363
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:12,673
uh?

364
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,691
who is this

365
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,070
who is this!

366
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:36,447
Come out

367
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:39,992
Yoon Boya

368
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:42,620
it's me

369
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:46,457
brother!

370
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,666
Yoon Boya

371
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:51,337
- Are you okay? Are you hurt?
- huh

372
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,463
Gyeonwooya

373
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:55,216
Hey, Gyeonwu?

374
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:06,435
Gyeonwooya

375
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:08,521
Seong-ah

376
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:12,191
Gyeonwooya

377
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:22,118
I just now
Oh, I was in the mountains, wasn't I?

378
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:26,747
It's in my memory

379
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:29,917
A soul without a body
If it stays in your memory

380
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:36,465
So I became friends with those soldiers

381
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:38,175
Are you telling me to listen to the story?

382
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:44,348
Because it's a beacon memory
One of the two will be a beacon

383
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:46,725
- Right?
- huh

384
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:50,104
Why can't the beacon ascend to heaven?
I need to know if you're a ghost

385
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:53,315
That's the only way to appease that soul.
It's easy to find

386
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:56,861
I'll try

387
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:00,197
uh?

388
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,950
The celebration is over

389
00:29:08,873 --> 00:29:11,083
Just wait, I'll be right back.

390
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:17,798
Yeah, I'll wait

391
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:46,827
excuse meâ€¦

392
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:48,787
Hey guys

393
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,380
Oh my, it'll be hard to become close

394
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:20,736
The silver ring
It's definitely something that the devil has

395
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:26,283
How do I get this

396
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:29,787
Not even one amulet
Are you just going to rip it all off?

397
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:32,122
Where are you? Girl, I'll go.

398
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:33,582
What's the devil doing?

399
00:30:35,543 --> 00:30:37,419
Why is he asking about the evil spirits first?

400
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:39,380
He is so happy

401
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:41,257
The rest are all in a state of anxiety

402
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,551
The fairy of heaven and earth is completely mentally broken

403
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:45,970
Summoning ghosts at the wedding
I told you I forgot

404
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,974
Now that I know, I must have called you out

405
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:52,393
I guess so, but why are you asking that?

406
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:55,521
I hung up, wow

407
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,648
okay

408
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,485
What you need to shake is

409
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,029
I have a heart

410
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:19,378
Gyeonwu!

411
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,381
Come to work

412
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:27,636
Let's go to the preliminary round, national team!

413
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:30,097
Hey, it's noisy

414
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,308
What? National team?

415
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:34,810
You wear the Taegeuk mark on your chest?

416
00:31:35,603 --> 00:31:37,938
Oh, so
Well, it's not done yet

417
00:31:38,022 --> 00:31:39,898
It's going to happen soon, something like this

418
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:44,236
Hey, can I get your autograph in advance?

419
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,405
Hey, hey, hey, me, me, me

420
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:47,990
Put me here, put me here

421
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:49,700
Hey, go, it tickles

422
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:51,535
Cool, cool, cool

423
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:53,746
- The signature is unusual, though.
- That's strange, what is this?

424
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:56,915
Hey, cool! Hey

425
00:31:56,999 --> 00:31:58,000
"If you write, you will live, if you write, you will die"

426
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:00,169
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute

427
00:32:01,712 --> 00:32:02,921
hey

428
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:04,798
why

429
00:32:04,882 --> 00:32:06,967
If I become a national team member, please grant me one wish.

430
00:32:07,051 --> 00:32:08,177
wish?

431
00:32:09,053 --> 00:32:09,970
What is your wish?

432
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:15,142
what?

433
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:16,685
You and me

434
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:20,606
Sir, I really want to see this

435
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:24,026
Why? Where are you going?

436
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:26,487
Hey, who wants to do it now?

437
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:29,156
I was just telling you what I wanted.
No, you can't even say that?

438
00:32:29,657 --> 00:32:32,076
Oh, don't say it
Don't say it out loud

439
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:33,911
Talking nonsense
I'm doing it, sir

440
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:36,038
Why doesn't this make sense?

441
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:39,041
I want to have my first kiss
I want to do that with you

442
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:41,377
What I desperately want is
There's only one

443
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,046
Just saying what I want
Why doesn't that make sense!

444
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,220
I want to have my first kiss with Park Sung-ah!

445
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:56,809
First kiss!

446
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:02,898
Are you crazy?

447
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:09,029
Why? You want to kiss a shaman too?

448
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:11,365
Of course you want to do it
Sorry for asking

449
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:12,574
Do you really want to die?

450
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:14,660
Unfortunately

451
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:16,745
I don't die well

452
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:19,081
Because my specialty is resurrection

453
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,129
however

454
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,800
But if you do it like this

455
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:32,428
Even a shaman once
Won't you look at me?

456
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:39,143
I'm in Baekyeonwoo's face again
It's Bae Gyeon-woo's body, isn't it?

457
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:50,696
Hey, Bae Gyeon-woo!

458
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:53,490
Your father keeps calling you

459
00:33:53,574 --> 00:33:54,408
father?

460
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:56,368
Baek Gyeon-woo's father won't be here

461
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,645
Where have I seen that person?

462
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:37,618
It's so scary, but the skills are so bad

463
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:41,622
Using Bae Gyeon-woo's family? You're using your brain.

464
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,792
You wrote the head first

465
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:46,877
You have a silver ring

466
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:49,797
I'll return it to the original owner

467
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,049
Didn't you wander around the nine heavens with one in your arms?

468
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:54,843
He said he would return it as soon as he got the human body

469
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:56,261
Why do you still have it?

470
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:59,556
I've been a bit busy

471
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:02,476
I have to become a national representative

472
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:13,320
I guess it's quite fun to act human

473
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:15,322
Yeah, it's fun

474
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:16,990
I'm going to live like this my whole life

475
00:35:19,076 --> 00:35:22,371
I'm on the verge of becoming an evil spirit
You are so strong

476
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:24,665
Just do as you please

477
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:26,750
And there's no control

478
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:31,463
So I thought about it

479
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:34,091
I'm having a hard time like this too

480
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:36,844
How hard is it for the fairies of heaven and earth?

481
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:49,189
The congratulatory message
Do you know what can come out?

482
00:35:54,111 --> 00:35:55,028
At the time of celebration

483
00:35:56,572 --> 00:35:57,948
What's coming out?

484
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:01,910
Baekyeonwoo is coming out?

485
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:04,913
also

486
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:07,040
I didn't know

487
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:12,504
Now he's a ghost
It's his time

488
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:14,798
Don't even tell me the country

489
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:17,259
A devil who stole a human body

490
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:19,303
I knew when it would change

491
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:22,431
Do you want to be human?

492
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:24,099
why?

493
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:28,228
When you become a human
Who would love you?

494
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:33,275
How scary

495
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,528
A person who is only human in appearance

496
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:39,114
If you keep pretending to be human

497
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:14,900
Me, just use one amulet

498
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:19,446
I became so weak that I couldn't even use the talisman
What kind of schemes are you constantly plotting, huh?

499
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:21,531
hey

500
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:24,284
Slow down a bit

501
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:28,497
Oh, I see, then

502
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,457
To my mom
What's more important than a baby?

503
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:34,002
What? Write it quickly?

504
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:37,881
okay

505
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:44,012
Oh, I originally
I don't use things like Imaemangryangbu

506
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:23,135
What are you doing here?

507
00:38:23,677 --> 00:38:24,553
uh?

508
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:30,851
anyâ€¦

509
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:32,310
It's nothing

510
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:37,190
let's go

511
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:41,653
I'm always welcome

512
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:43,363
I'll wait at the abandoned house

513
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:44,823
who are you?

514
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:47,784
You don't have any friends, do you?

515
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:50,120
I'm friends with this kind of person

516
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:57,252
Wow, shit, that's scary, huh?

517
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,420
What's that guy?

518
00:38:59,588 --> 00:39:00,756
It's nothing

519
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:03,550
Hey, let's go together

520
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:12,893
Aren't you curious about the true feelings of the fairies of heaven and earth?

521
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:15,604
Check it out yourself

522
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:45,092
Gyeonwooya

523
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:48,386
Gyeonwoo, it's time to wake up

524
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:50,972
Gyeonwooya

525
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:57,229
Gyeonwooya

526
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:26,633
what?

527
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:29,553
Why do you look so sad?

528
00:40:30,846 --> 00:40:31,847
My eyes are crying

529
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:39,729
Well, uh

530
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:42,607
Is it because I missed you so much?

531
00:40:46,236 --> 00:40:47,320
me too

532
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:50,657
I really, really missed you too

533
00:40:53,827 --> 00:40:55,787
How is it there? Is it livable?

534
00:40:55,871 --> 00:40:58,456
Oh, did you become friendly with those soldiers?

535
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,959
Of the two
Did you find out who Bongsu is?

536
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,554
why

537
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:15,015
Aren't we close yet?

538
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,437
That could be it

539
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:24,065
But we became friends quickly

540
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:26,776
How to move a beacon tower
I wish I could find it

541
00:41:31,615 --> 00:41:33,617
Take care of your beacon

542
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,577
You too come back to your place

543
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:41,416
Shaman

544
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:53,303
Shaman

545
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,235
Shaman

546
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:13,949
Bongsuya

547
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:44,187
Why is their atmosphere like that?

548
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,862
Attention! Greetings to the teacher

549
00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:54,990
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

550
00:42:55,532 --> 00:42:58,285
Just like that
You guys won't come back to life until class is over!

551
00:42:59,703 --> 00:43:01,329
Ah, someone who's going to the bloodbath!

552
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:02,414
I have to go to the PC room, I have to go

553
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:03,957
People who want to go to the shelter!

554
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:06,501
Pack your bags quickly, pack your bags quickly

555
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,044
You too, pack your bags quickly

556
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:18,054
- Hey, what is it?
- What is it, what is it?

557
00:43:18,138 --> 00:43:19,556
- Hey, what is it?
- What is it?

558
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:25,937
Love as a rule
Shouldn't it be banned?

559
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:28,356
I can't breathe, I can't live

560
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,066
Seong-ah, your hand must hurt

561
00:43:31,568 --> 00:43:33,653
It's all here, I was planning on letting it go anyway

562
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:35,905
Why hereâ€¦

563
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:40,368
noâ€¦

564
00:43:41,328 --> 00:43:43,830
Here it is, the name I was looking for

565
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:47,250
Among the two student soldiers

566
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:49,419
I have a big baby

567
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:51,087
The little one is this

568
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:53,548
Jang Yoon-Boya

569
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,592
When Yunbo died

570
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:57,510
The silver ring my mother gave me

571
00:43:57,594 --> 00:44:00,263
Come home instead of me
I asked you to send it to me

572
00:44:01,598 --> 00:44:04,309
I can't grant that request
I'm sad that I died

573
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:08,021
I became a ghost

574
00:44:44,391 --> 00:44:45,975
I did it like this

575
00:44:47,394 --> 00:44:48,853
I guess my anger will be relieved a little.

576
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:50,772
Bongsuya

577
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:52,774
Now that I've released one, the sealing is finished

578
00:44:54,234 --> 00:44:55,193
I'm going to live as Bae Gyeon-woo

579
00:44:58,321 --> 00:44:59,656
What about Gyeonwu?

580
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:02,200
Baek Gyeon-woo?

581
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:05,286
He's already a ghost

582
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:06,871
Only appears on holidays

583
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:09,916
Let's go now

584
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:12,419
Oh, no, hey, wait a minute

585
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:15,171
- hey
- Seong-ah, you're sick!

586
00:45:23,263 --> 00:45:24,264
I'm sick too

587
00:45:29,394 --> 00:45:30,395
Me tooâ€¦

588
00:45:31,104 --> 00:45:32,188
I'm sick too

589
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:46,578
Are you here?

590
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,079
What about the amulet?

591
00:45:48,163 --> 00:45:49,914
Look at that girl, she's so impatient

592
00:45:49,998 --> 00:45:52,083
Hey buddy, are you still breathing?

593
00:45:53,126 --> 00:45:55,920
Oh, where
Does Cheonggukjang smell like this?

594
00:45:56,004 --> 00:45:56,838
The amulet!

595
00:45:57,922 --> 00:45:59,215
It's over there

596
00:46:09,184 --> 00:46:10,018
what?

597
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,228
Sorry, buddy.

598
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:40,089
Let go, now

599
00:46:41,216 --> 00:46:43,801
No matter how scared you are
Even if I lose it, it's not like that

600
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:46,679
Where did you think of calling the grim reaper?

601
00:46:47,472 --> 00:46:50,892
The grim reaper who came down without a list
What's the difference between this and a murderer?

602
00:46:51,518 --> 00:46:54,521
You can kill anyone
It doesn't matter how many people I kill

603
00:46:54,604 --> 00:46:57,774
Even demons avoid the nameless messenger.

604
00:46:58,525 --> 00:47:00,944
No matter how desperate it is, that's not it

605
00:47:01,027 --> 00:47:02,195
So what?

606
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:04,072
What are you going to do?

607
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:06,241
The evil spirit that is attached to your body

608
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:08,493
That guy who acts like he's the one who gave his body

609
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:09,953
I'm going to take it off

610
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:16,000
no

611
00:47:16,543 --> 00:47:17,502
No way

612
00:47:18,086 --> 00:47:19,087
no!

613
00:47:20,797 --> 00:47:22,048
no

614
00:47:22,549 --> 00:47:23,424
no

615
00:47:24,509 --> 00:47:26,261
Don't do that, okay?

616
00:47:26,886 --> 00:47:28,471
Absolutely not, don't do it!

617
00:47:29,264 --> 00:47:30,640
Don't do that

618
00:47:31,224 --> 00:47:33,017
I beg you, don't do that.

619
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:35,728
No, don't do that!

620
00:47:35,812 --> 00:47:39,148
You stop being a shaman now

621
00:47:39,232 --> 00:47:40,692
don't do it!

622
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:42,193
Don't do it, don't do it!

623
00:47:42,277 --> 00:47:44,237
Don't do it! Don't do it!

624
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,572
don't

625
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:47,740
summer solsticeâ€¦

626
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:13,016
I helped you because you asked me to

627
00:48:13,516 --> 00:48:15,143
If it goes that wrong

628
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:17,770
Letting go
It could be a path for each other

629
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,566
Chlorine can't come back

630
00:48:24,861 --> 00:48:27,113
I'm not holding you back to come back

631
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:30,033
then?

632
00:48:30,617 --> 00:48:32,076
I'm following him

633
00:48:32,744 --> 00:48:34,912
He won't let go of my child

634
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:37,040
How do I let myself go

635
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:41,711
I have to follow him to where he goes.

636
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:46,299
Even if you cross the line?

637
00:48:48,176 --> 00:48:49,177
I have to go

638
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:01,022
Cut off all the limbs again

639
00:49:02,649 --> 00:49:03,566
The baby

640
00:49:06,486 --> 00:49:07,987
What about my baby

641
00:49:09,906 --> 00:49:11,491
Are you afraid of lions?

642
00:49:13,493 --> 00:49:15,078
Are you afraid of evil spirits?

643
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:18,748
no

644
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:21,417
You should be the one who fears me the most

645
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:25,338
A mother who lost her child

646
00:49:41,104 --> 00:49:43,189
What was taken away from you that you gave me?

647
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:48,528
The evil spirits that gave me a body
It was spread all over the street

648
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:19,434
Gyeonwu, you really can't come back?

649
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:22,353
If Bongsu decides to live as Gyeonwoo

650
00:50:22,437 --> 00:50:24,522
Gyeonwu can't do anything and just

651
00:50:24,981 --> 00:50:26,441
Do I have no choice but to lose my body?

652
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,113
Is that so?

653
00:50:37,827 --> 00:50:40,037
Of course I have another way

654
00:50:42,999 --> 00:50:44,375
Any other way?

655
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:48,421
Other people only know how to appease

656
00:50:49,338 --> 00:50:51,132
I know how to get mad too

657
00:50:55,595 --> 00:50:56,804
Quit archery?

658
00:50:57,346 --> 00:50:59,640
What the hell are you talking about!

659
00:50:59,724 --> 00:51:02,310
I won't do it, it's not fun, now

660
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:04,479
What about you, national team? Olympics!

661
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:08,357
Oh, if you want to go out like that
Practice and the coach will leave!

662
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:10,568
- Oh, man, this is annoying!
- Where does this little bastard have his eyesâ€¦

663
00:51:11,194 --> 00:51:12,069
Huh?

664
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:18,493
You don't stand there!

665
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,500
Archery is a dream

666
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:27,293
What are you
Are you giving up your dream so easily?

667
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:28,795
I'm Baek Gyeon Woo

668
00:51:28,878 --> 00:51:31,631
I am Bae Gyeon-woo in front of you

669
00:51:31,714 --> 00:51:34,550
I'm going to give up on my dream
What's your business?

670
00:51:34,634 --> 00:51:36,302
You're not Gyeonwu, you're Bongsu!

671
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:37,595
Don't call me a beacon!

672
00:51:39,722 --> 00:51:41,557
That anyway
That's not even my real name

673
00:51:42,517 --> 00:51:44,477
You didn't do it on your own

674
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:47,522
I'm like that now
I don't want to live with a name that someone else made up.

675
00:51:47,605 --> 00:51:48,981
You ahead

676
00:51:49,065 --> 00:51:50,650
You call me Bae Gyeon Woo
If you're not going to call me,

677
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:51,859
Don't talk to me, okay?

678
00:51:57,490 --> 00:51:59,659
Of course I have another way

679
00:52:05,748 --> 00:52:08,334
The devil has a silver ring

680
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,132
Bring it

681
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:17,885
Then the evil spirit will disappear

682
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:25,601
Hey, hey, stop it, hey, don't do it

683
00:52:25,685 --> 00:52:27,937
Hey, Bongsu, hey, hey, hey!

684
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:31,566
Get out of my way! My stuff
I'm going to throw it away! Really

685
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:32,900
Who are you!

686
00:52:51,419 --> 00:52:52,378
thank you

687
00:52:53,004 --> 00:52:54,755
Now with that
What are you doing?

688
00:52:58,217 --> 00:53:00,928
That's before giving the ring
I'm asking

689
00:53:01,554 --> 00:53:02,471
bye

690
00:53:10,563 --> 00:53:11,564
hey

691
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:16,235
Over there, over there!

692
00:53:17,069 --> 00:53:18,237
hey!

693
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:37,673
really

694
00:53:41,636 --> 00:53:42,720
What the heck?

695
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:47,642
Hey, Seong-ah

696
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:50,311
What should I do? I think I made a mistake.

697
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:53,189
Hey, hey, are you okay?

698
00:53:53,272 --> 00:53:54,649
Bongsu!

699
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:57,026
Bongsu!

Don't do it! It hurts!

704
00:54:15,503 --> 00:54:19,715
Now that I have the treasure, I will give it to you.
I'll definitely call the grim reaper

705
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:22,551
Let's carry out a diversionary operation

706
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:26,597
I put up a barrier
Hide the location of the beacon

707
00:54:26,681 --> 00:54:30,059
Seong-ah is wearing a silver ring
Go to the place where you were buried and do a ritual.

708
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:33,479
Hide your identity here

709
00:54:33,562 --> 00:54:35,231
Let's do some good there to protect us

710
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:38,985
The grim reaper
A beggar who leads people in the wrong direction

711
00:54:46,409 --> 00:54:48,411
There's a memorial service today, please step aside!

712
00:54:48,494 --> 00:54:50,079
