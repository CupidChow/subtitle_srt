1
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:28,232
What are you…

2
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:31,777
doing here?

3
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,033
Gyeon-U.

4
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:50,004
Gyeon-U.

5
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:51,922
Gyeon-U!

6
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,187
I'll save him.
I'll fend off all misfortune.

7
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:10,107
I promise you to free him from misfortune
after the next three weeks.

8
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,734
Were you at the funeral?

9
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:12,943
Ji-ho. He filled me in.

10
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:16,030
I couldn't have been there.
I was so not there.

11
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,448
You little brat.

12
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:18,741
Do you think I'm here for you?

13
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:20,034
I'm here to see your grandmother.

14
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,786
<i>Bad accidents were like fate.</i>

15
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,747
<i>They were always waiting for me.</i>

16
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,959
<i>Lucky breaks were like a miracle.</i>

17
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:30,669
<i>They never happened to me.</i>

18
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,885
<i>A girl said she'd be there for me</i>

19
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,845
<i>until darkness gave way to light.</i>

20
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:44,850
<i>Her hands were so warm</i>

21
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:48,228
<i>that I thought I could be happy for once.</i>

22
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:52,650
<i>But it turned out to be</i>

23
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,526
<i>an impossible dream.</i>

24
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:02,493
Gyeon-U.

25
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:05,621
Bae Gyeon-U.

26
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,334
Gyeon-U.

27
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,052
I'm sorry, Gyeon-U.

28
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:25,724
Don't cry.

29
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,643
You don't get to snivel now.

30
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:52,960
Fancy meeting you here.

31
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,840
You ignored me?

32
00:04:58,507 --> 00:04:59,508
You crazy?

33
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,098
Let's do this tomorrow.

34
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:07,224
Not tonight.

35
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:12,438
Have you really lost it?

36
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:25,784
What the heck?

37
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:33,375
What…

38
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:36,378
did I do to deserve this?

39
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:41,842
I didn't ask you to like me.

40
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:44,470
Hate me all you want.

41
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:48,182
You know I can't do anything
however much you hate me!

42
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:51,894
You could've

43
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,353
just gone on hating me

44
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,105
and loathing me.

45
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:59,276
Why are you taking it this far? Just why?

46
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:03,197
Just…

47
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:08,202
how much more pitiful must I be

48
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,413
to make you stop?

49
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:24,718
Gyeon-U.

50
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,089
Gyeon-U.

51
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:32,828
I'm sorry.

52
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,919
Damn it.

53
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:43,964
Go away!

54
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,174
Get lost!

55
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:47,050
Just go!

56
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,807
I wasn't saying that to you.

57
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,062
You really are a shaman, after all.

58
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:03,692
I can tell by your shamelessness.

59
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,823
You must've had fun.

60
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,203
It wasn't like that.
I meant to tell you from the start.

61
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,374
But I couldn't
because you hated it so much.

62
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:27,549
<i>You may feel sorry for me for now,</i>

63
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,801
<i>but soon, things will get real fun.</i>

64
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,387
<i>"You're plagued with misfortune."</i>

65
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:33,931
<i>"You're jinxed."</i>

66
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,141
"You'll die soon."

67
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:38,977
Taunting me with stuff like that

68
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,021
will become enjoyable to you.

69
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,195
<i>You'll see me struggle desperately</i>

70
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:53,575
<i>and do everything I'm told</i>
<i>as if I've become someone's marionette.</i>

71
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:56,245
<i>You'll end up laughing at me too.</i>

72
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:58,956
You try so hard.

73
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:04,211
You have no idea
you're a frog in boiling water.

74
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,674
I'm not like other shamans.

75
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:11,677
I know everything I say
will sound like an excuse--

76
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,136
They're not excuses.

77
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,805
They're lies.

78
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,184
Of all the things you said to me so far,

79
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:22,854
how many of them weren't a lie?

80
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:37,244
Who is it?

81
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,205
Who could be this vile?

82
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:47,045
<i>This boundary was made with the purpose</i>
<i>of making the one inside</i>

83
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,339
<i>an evil deity.</i>

84
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:52,926
<i>An exchange of equivalents.</i>

85
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,763
<i>The caster bet their own life.</i>

86
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:58,765
Be very meticulous.

87
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,230
<i>Seal the place from the outside</i>

88
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:07,107
<i>so not even an insect can crawl in.</i>

89
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,944
<i>If nothing can go into the house,</i>
<i>nothing will end up as a sacrifice.</i>

90
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,331
-<i>Close the door and seal it</i>
-<i>Close the door and seal it</i>

91
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:25,876
<i>With my bright energy I rebuke you</i>
<i>The sun rises in the east</i>

92
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,337
-<i>Close the door and seal it</i>
-<i>Close the door and seal it</i>

93
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,797
<i>With these amulets I command you</i>
<i>Release the inauspicious energy</i>

94
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:33,091
-<i>Close the door and seal it</i>
-<i>Close the door and seal it</i>

95
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:35,344
<i>The sun gives out fire of samadhi</i>

96
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,429
-<i>Close the door and seal it</i>
-<i>Close the door and seal it</i>

97
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:39,806
<i>It dims the ill light and subdues ghouls</i>

98
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,184
-<i>Close the door and seal it</i>
-<i>Close the door and seal it</i>

99

<i>Sacred warrior sent from above</i>

-<i>Close the door and seal it</i>

101
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,316

-<i>Close the door and seal it</i>
-<i>Close the door and seal it</i>

105
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,241
<i>And make everything fair and promising</i>

106
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:08,251
Just why isn't she picking up the phone?

107
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:11,338
What's wrong? Are you worried
Yeomhwa might have harmed her?

108
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,506
Watch it.

109
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:13,757
Master.

110
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,010
Why are you so worked up?

111
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:19,638
Your thoughts must be
going in that direction too

112
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,640
seeing how you keep calling her.

113
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,310
Wait.

114
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,855
-Do you hear that sound?
-What sound?

115
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,483
A phone ringing.

116
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:35,904
WOLSEONG SHRINE

117
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:37,447

118
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:44,746
Seong-A!

119
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:50,127
You're back.

120
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:55,674
I see you've decided to torture me today.

121
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,384
Why didn't you answer your phone…

122
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:04,141
Why the long face? What's wrong?

123
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:08,061
-Mother.
-What?

124
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:10,564
At the abandoned house…

125
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,274
What about the abandoned house?

126
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:13,775
Did something happen?

127
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:15,986
Well?

128
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:18,405
At the abandoned house…

129
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,031
Go on. I'm listening.

130
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:25,704
I was found out…

131
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:28,790
to be a shaman.

132
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:32,711
Gyeon-U knows.

133
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,430
<i>It's an amulet</i>

134
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,432
<i>that wards off evil.</i>

135
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,144
You could've drawn it on my face only.

136
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:52,731
<i>In case she doesn't cross over.</i>

137
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:57,235
<i>She was with you for such a long time.</i>

138
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:01,323
<i>I did it to protect.</i>

139
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:02,741
To protect you.

140
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:07,037
I thought you'd be devastated
if you found out I'm a shaman.

141
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:11,082
I'm sorry

142
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:13,460
for wanting to be your friend.

143
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,347
BAE GYEON-U! SAVE HIM! PROTECT HIM!

144
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:28,141
<i>For just five days starting tomorrow.</i>

145
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:30,268
Stay friends with me
for just five more days.

146
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,772
You can hate me
and yell at me all you want.

147
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:36,191
Stay by my side for five more days.

BOOK ON THE SECRETS OF THWARTING EVIL

149
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,502
This boundary was made with the purpose
of making the one inside

150
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:57,754
an evil deity.

151
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,882
<i>Once inside, even the greatest shaman</i>

152
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:02,551
<i>will become a sacrifice.</i>

153
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:06,096
They'll be overcome
by the evil spirit and die.

154
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,224
Come on. Not just anyone
can become an evil deity.

155
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,894
They must kill 100 living people,
not just spirits, to…

156
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:16,648
No way.

157
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,358
Is it almost there already?

158
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:21,778
With just a couple left to go?

159
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,091
Did you ask her
if she met Yeomhwa at the abandoned house?

160
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:47,137
-Not yet.
-Why are you dragging it out?

161
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,513
Just ask her.

162
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,225
Good morning.

163
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,229
<i>-Dear viewers, our guest today</i>
-Did you see her yesterday at the shack?

164
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:57,314
<i>is highly sought-after.</i>

165
00:14:58,148 --> 00:14:59,149
<i>Hello.</i>

166
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:02,652
<i>I'm Yeomhwa, a medium. Nice to meet you.</i>

167
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:04,654
<i>Before we start…</i>

168
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:06,740
-Yes, I saw her.
-You saw her?

169
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:10,702
What was she doing there?

170
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,120
Did she tell you anything

171
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,456
or perhaps harass you?

172
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:18,877
She didn't say much.
We just danced together.

173
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,880
You danced? Why?

174
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,634
She told me to dance
the Flower Lantern Dance.

175
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:28,345
That's a dance for two, so--

176
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,847
My goodness. You're really something.

177
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,891
You dared dance alone
with that notorious Yeomhwa?

178
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:35,018
It's worse than smoking with an elder.

179
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,355
General.

180
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,107
She'll become a great shaman. My word.

181
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:43,068
Shut your damn mouth, will you?

182
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,278
What's the matter?

183
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:48,281
She said she was one of the shamans
Great Aunt had called

184
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:50,492
and said she'd arrived a bit early.

185
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,329
That's a complete lie.

186
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,791
-What?
-Don't get me started.

187
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:00,669
Our elder shaman gathered
great shamans for nothing.

188
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:02,504
That witch beat us to it.

189
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:04,381
She cast a spell that turns anyone

190
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,508
entering the shack
into an offering to the evil spirit.

191
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:07,801
She even put up her own life.

192
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:09,969
The law of equivalent exchange.

193
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:12,764
We couldn't risk our lives,

194
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:15,141
so we sealed the shack from outside
instead of going in.

195
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:16,976
That reckless wench.

196
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,354
Why try to serve an evil spirit
and not just some ghost?

197
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:20,897
Doesn't she fear hell?

198
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,274
<i>Hell isn't far away.</i>

199
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,569
<i>Life as a shaman is hellish already.</i>

200
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,698
<i>Seeing ghosts isn't a skill or talent.</i>

201
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:32,784
It's a curse.

202
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,792
Stacking up karma with her tongue, I see.

203
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,878
ONE OF THE THREE KARMAS,
CAUSED BY ILL SPEECH

204
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,885
I'll get ready for school.

205
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,197
<i>Gyeon-U, I'm sorry.</i>

206
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:13,950
<i>Give me just five days.</i>

207
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,507
What's up with you two?

208
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:32,135
What's going on?

209
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:35,638
Nothing's going on.

210
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:37,390
Are you sure?

211
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,268
Yeah.

212
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,909
Seeing ghosts isn't a skill or talent.

213
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,411
It's a curse.

214
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,515
Patch things up.

215
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,894
I can tell you two argued.
Patch things up already.

216
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:24,354
Or it'll ruin our assessment.

217
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,315
We didn't argue.

218
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:29,317
Do you think I'm stupid? You argued.

219
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,485
Big time, too.

220
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,114
For the first time in my life,
I like your direct approach, Hye-ri.

221
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:37,325
Don't be silly.

222
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:39,619
If you two won't make up,

223
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,871
at least tell us why you argued.

224
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,706
It's been bothering me all day.

225
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:45,917
It's a personal matter.

226
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,670
It has nothing to do with you guys.

227
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:52,715
Come on, don't be like that.

228
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:59,138
I wish they didn't serve
braised beans at lunch.

229
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:03,226
Do you have to bring up
braised beans right now?

230
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:06,104
When can I talk about them if not now?

231
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:10,984
I should mention braised beans
when they're served.

232
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:14,529
If I were to say I hate braised beans
when they weren't served for lunch,

233
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:15,989
that's talking behind their back.

234
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:17,824
That's doubly hating on them.

235
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,951
I don't dislike braised beans that much.

236
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:23,037
But some may feel bad about it

237
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:25,665
and won't say they dislike
braised beans to their face.

238
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,292
They don't want to
hurt the beans' feelings.

239
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:30,670
They might whisper,

240
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:33,256
"I don't like braised beans,"

241
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,800
but I wouldn't assume
that they doubly dislike them.

242
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:39,804
Most likely their dislike
is only half the regular amount,

243
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:43,057
since they're keeping quiet
to preserve the beans' dignity.

244
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,521
What is she talking about?

245
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,984
If Seong-A is Gyeon-U's braised beans…

246
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:58,281
demanding he explain
why he dislikes his braised beans

247
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,658
is almost cruel to him.

248
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:16,716
I'm…

249
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:20,178
I'm a shaman.

250
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:26,225
I said I had a part-time job,
but I'm actually a shaman.

251
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:28,227
That shaman in the video
Ju-seung was on about

252
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:29,646
is indeed me.

253
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:32,398
I got initiated at eight,
and I've been a shaman ever since.

254
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:35,443
I didn't attend
elementary and middle school.

255
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:39,197
There were times when I wasn't a student,
but I was never not a shaman.

256
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:44,285
I wanted to be an ordinary student.
That's why I kept it a secret.

257
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,788
I swear it was never to deceive people.

258
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:50,667
Then I met Gyeon-U who hates shamans,

259
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:53,461
and I wanted to be his friend.

260
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:55,129
So…

261
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,465
ever since then…

262
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:01,678
I'm sorry.

263
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:05,181
I lied.

264
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:10,937
Then last night,
Gyeon-U found out the truth.

265
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,404
Can I ask you something?

266
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:20,488
Sure.

267
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:23,157
Why did you want us to be friends?

268
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:31,040
-Because--
-We can be friends with anyone we want.

269
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:32,542
Do we have to have a reason?

270
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:33,793
There usually is a reason,

271
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:35,712
especially for shamans.

272
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:48,683
He really does despise shamans.

273
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:51,185
Why don't you just tell him

274
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:54,230
that you're keeping him close
to protect him for 21 days?

275
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:59,736
But he was right about me
befriending him with an intention.

276
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,447
I guess, but…

277
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,533
"You're destined to die in 21 days."

278
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,285
Stuff like that…

279
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:11,497
should only be shared
after you've actually saved them.

280
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:14,417
Before then, you'd only be
scaring and threatening them.

281
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,462
I guess you're right, but…

282
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,465
How many days are left?

283
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:22,800
Five days.

284
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,552
That many?

285
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:34,270
How would you find Yeomhwa
when even I couldn't?

286
00:22:35,313 --> 00:22:36,898
Have you lost all your powers?

287
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:40,026
Why waste time and energy
when you won't be able to find her?

288
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:42,570
Shush it.
Don't quibble about my decision.

289
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:46,407
I reached out
to all my emergency contacts.

290
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,953
Yeomhwa did some serious preparations.

291
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:54,624
She sold her house and her office
and canceled all her bookings.

292
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:57,668
She scraped together all her savings,
disconnected her number,

293
00:22:57,752 --> 00:22:58,753
and went off the grid.

294
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:02,924
There must be something she still fears
if she has gone into hiding.

295
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:04,926
Do you really think so?

296
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,178
I'd say she cut contact
so no one would disturb her.

297
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:12,183
It's clear she's determined
to serve an evil deity.

298
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:15,144
All the more reason to find her, then.

299
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:18,231
I must find her
and knock some sense into her.

300
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:19,774
I'm off.

301
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:22,401
A typical behavior for a shaman
serving a general god,

302
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:24,529
jumping in like a good little soldier.

303
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:27,698
I wouldn't say anything if you served.
I'm the one who actually served.

304
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:31,911
Weren't you discharged
for medical reasons?

305
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:33,496
I got possessed when I was in the army.

306
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:36,624
I was supposed to say "attention"
in a manly voice when…

307
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:42,547
We'll finish making the slide deck today.

308
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,674
No one's going home until then.

309
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:47,093
And you two.

310
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:49,595
I won't let you sneak off
for archery practice or whatever.

311
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:50,513
Got it?

312
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,350
-Why's he the best archer?
-Darn it.

313
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,021
Let's go.

314
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:04,277
I won't let him catch on

315
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,903
that I knew you were a shaman.

316
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,573
If he found out
that I was in on it from the start,

317
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:12,451
-then he'd really have no one to turn to.
-Right.

318
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,164
I'll feel guilty for us both.

319
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:18,040
Stop feeling bad and protect him well.

320
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,376
Then get him to apologize
when the 21 days are up.

321
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,794
<i>Okay?</i>

322
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:24,797
It will take ages to make the deck.

323
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:34,682
Do you have business

324
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:36,809
with my legs?

325
00:24:36,893 --> 00:24:38,561
No, it's nothing. Let's go.

326
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:44,150
It's still fast asleep.

327
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,613
My baby.

328
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:50,615
Where did my baby go?

329
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:51,824
My baby.

330
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:53,951
The baby's gone.

331
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:56,370
-That's dirty.
-The baby's gone.

332
00:24:56,454 --> 00:24:58,497
Stop going through the trash!

333
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:00,708
Listen, dear. Your baby's not here.

334
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:03,628
Babies can't be out here.
That would be dangerous.

335
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:06,214
-Your hands are dirty.
-Where…

336
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,426
What's the matter?

337
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,303
-What is it?
-Wait.

338
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:15,056
Wait. Oh, my goodness.

339
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:16,641
-You thief!
-What on earth?

340
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:18,684
-What's wrong?
-Give my baby back to me!

341
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:20,519
What are you doing? Wait. Let her go!

342
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:21,896
-Do-yeon.
-What's wrong?

343
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:23,314
-You thief!
-Wait.

344
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:24,273
-Hey.
-Calm down.

345
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:25,775
-Stop it.
-Wait.

346
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,443
-Let go of her.
-Thief!

347
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,779
Calm down. Relax.

348
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,113
Oh, my gosh.

349
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:32,740
No, wait.

350
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:35,868
What's gotten into you?

351
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:41,165
Stop, you both!

352
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:50,508
<i>Don't look at him. Don't.</i>

353
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:54,470
<i>Loud noises wake the Baby Ghost.</i>

354
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:05,314
<i>A Baby Ghost isn't all that bad.</i>

355
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:07,775
What can a baby do but cry?

356
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:10,486
If it cries, comfort it.

357
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,489
But if you fail to do so…

358
00:26:14,824 --> 00:26:16,742
<i>Then it'll be a disaster.</i>

359
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,459
<i>No, don't cry. He's not a bad person.</i>

360
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:27,378
<i>He's just plagued by misfortune.</i>

361
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:30,965
Peekaboo.

362
00:26:32,008 --> 00:26:34,051
Peekaboo.

363
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,638
Thank you.

364
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,233
<i>Whatever. Human Amulet to the rescue!</i>

365
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,383
<i>Why did it shatter?</i>

366
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:15,801
<i>I held his hand.</i>

367
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:20,348
Are you hurt? Let me see.

368
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:21,515
It's okay.

369
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:25,311
-Hey, you're bleeding.
-I'm fine, all right?

370
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:30,024
Hey. Are you really okay?

371
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:33,361
It's a graze.

372
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:35,237
A little blow on it will do.

373
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:37,114
Are you okay?

374
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:39,492
-I'm so sorry.
-It's fine.

375
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:40,701
And you? Are you okay?

376
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:43,079
Yeah, I'm okay.

377
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:45,206
Why did the glass suddenly shatter?

378
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:47,500
-Beats me. But let's--
-I'm going home.

379
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:50,711
How can you say
you'll go home in this situation?

380
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:52,254
You said we could go when we were done.

381
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:54,131
All done.

382
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:58,177
LIFE AND ETHICS
PRESENTATION DECK

383
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,930
Do-yeon took care of the deck.

384
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:03,140
<i>Something's not right.</i>

385
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:04,767
<i>I need to look into it.</i>

386
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:10,398
You want to visit my place? But why?

387
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,733
I thought

388
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:14,777
it'd be nice if we became friends.

389
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,070
Why would that be nice?

390
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:20,074
It'd make more sense if you wanted
some tips from the deck expert.

391
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:22,034
Exactly. I want to learn from you.

392
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:28,499
Hello.

393
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:29,875
No one's home.

394
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:31,085
My parents both work.

395
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:39,343
This is impressive.

396
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:43,639
I'd like you to go into detail
about what you find so impressive.

397
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:47,518
Oh, well, you know…

398
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:49,019
I mean…

399
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:17,715
<i>So the ghost wasn't stuck to Do-yeon.</i>

400
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:20,551
You have a great eye.

401
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:23,095
This makes it much easier.

402
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,058
No.

403
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:29,935
Is 500,000 won too little?

404
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:31,061
Then…

405
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:33,397
how about a million won?

406
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:35,816
Patricia is my child.

407
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:38,402
Do you think I'll sell her for money?

408
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:42,281
I'll treat your child like my own.

409
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:43,574
I'll love and cherish it.

410
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:45,868
I fell for it at first sight.

411
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,703
Can you… Please?

412
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:51,624
You're lying.

413
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:56,295
You tried to obtain her with money.
That can't be true love.

414
00:29:58,547 --> 00:29:59,673
Leave.

415
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:01,467
I'm her mom. You don't qualify.

416
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:08,557
Okay, I'll leave.

417
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:09,975
I'll leave for now.

418
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:11,060
Calm down.

419
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:38,295
<i>For just five days starting tomorrow.</i>

420
00:30:38,379 --> 00:30:40,256
Stay friends with me
for just five more days.

421
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:47,012
<i>What in the world is she up to?</i>

422
00:31:06,991 --> 00:31:08,200
Gyeon-U.

423
00:31:08,284 --> 00:31:10,578
Hey, Gyeon-U. High-five.

424
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:16,417
<i>Is it pity?</i>

425
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:19,128
<i>It's friendship.</i>

426
00:31:19,712 --> 00:31:20,963
<i>They were all spells.</i>

427
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:25,259
It wasn't pity or friendship.

428
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:29,179
You were just being a shaman
from the start.

429
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:50,367
Nothing's working out, huh?

430
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:53,996
Do you want an amulet?

431
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:56,832
The amulet…

432
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,794
The Human Amulet didn't work.

433
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,718
The Baby Ghost stuck to the doll
must be really powerful.

434
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:09,803
I need to get the doll

435
00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:12,264
if I'm to perform a rite
and weaken its power.

436
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:17,436
Your power didn't work

437
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:20,064
on the boy who found out
you are a shaman?

438
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:23,233
-Yes.
-Then you don't yet know

439
00:32:23,317 --> 00:32:26,695
if the Baby Ghost is strong
or you're plain weak.

440
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:31,450
Human or not, all amulets are the same.

441
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,828
When did your powers stop working?

442
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:37,081
Think carefully.

443
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:39,792
When do they stop working?

444
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:41,085
I wouldn't know.

445
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:42,878
My amulets are always effective.

446
00:32:44,672 --> 00:32:45,673
What do you say?

447
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:48,425
Do you want a new one?

448
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:22,292
Let's stay moisturized.

449
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:51,655
Now, the social ideology…

450
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:55,993
This headache is so annoying.

451
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,288
Sir.

452
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,331
My head aches.

453
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:03,083
Mine too. What's going on?

454
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:05,627
Open the windows
and let in some fresh air.

455
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,737
Sir, can I go see the nurse?

456
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,238
Yes, go ahead. Be quick.

457
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:38,744
Let's sit up and stretch a bit.

458
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:47,211
Do-yeon.

459
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:54,593
-Did you think about it?
-About what?

460
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:58,013
About your doll.

461
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,556
Could you give it to me?

462
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:05,938
Hey, Ku Do-yeon.
Why did you spray water on her?

463
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:08,482
-Are you a sociopath?
-That's rich coming from you.

464
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:10,901
-What?
-Hey, don't fight.

465
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:12,194
I'm fine.

466
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:15,697
You keep quiet.
Do I have to be okay with it if you are?

467
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:18,617
-Let's work on our assessment.
-I am.

468
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,161
We're at the library. Keep it down.

469
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:23,455
You keep it down. You're louder.

470
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:26,708
And the second slide.
This isn't right. Fix it.

471
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:28,669
However loud I try to be,
I can't be as loud as you.

472
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:29,753
And…

473
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:31,296
as for the second slide,

474
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:33,882
you just don't get it
because you have poor taste.

475
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:36,426
What, taste? "Taste"?

476
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:39,388
-You are a sociopath.
<i>-It looks like it'll cry soon.</i>

477
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:42,057
-"Taste," my foot.
<i>-First,</i>

478
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:45,060
<i>whether it works or not,</i>

479
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,980
<i>let's try being the Human Amulet again.</i>

480
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:50,065
<i>Please.</i>

481
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:52,776
<i>Just one more time.</i>

482
00:35:56,238 --> 00:35:57,614
<i>The spell.</i>

483
00:35:58,615 --> 00:35:59,449
<i>Again.</i>

484
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:07,291
I don't know you well,

485
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,126
but I know about shamans.

486
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:12,129
You've been casting spells on me,
haven't you?

487
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,717
Is this how it works?

488
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:18,927
<i>How did you know?</i>

489
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:22,264
<i>What you're going through now</i>

490
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:24,433
<i>must be hellish.</i>

491
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:55,213
<i>The power of the Human Amulet</i>

492
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:57,841
<i>disappeared completely.</i>

493
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:02,888
<i>I can…</i>

494
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:06,433
<i>no longer protect Gyeon-U.</i>

495
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:17,277
JEIL GENERAL HOSPITAL

496
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:27,788
<i>Human or not, all amulets are the same.</i>

497
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:29,247
Think carefully.

498
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:32,084
When did your powers stop working?

499
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:41,969
Why are you here and not in bed?

500
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:45,973
I'm okay. I wasn't hurt.

501
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:48,475
Doesn't being here hurt your heart?

502
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:52,062
I brought it upon myself.

503
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:54,523
That's a stretch.

504
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:02,072
Do you want to lean on my broad shoulder?

505
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,116
No, thanks.

506
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:09,246
Oh, my gosh, Gyeon-U.

507
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:10,998
Oh, look at you.

508
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:13,542
Oh, Gyeon-U.

509
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:17,337
<i>My powers as a Human Amulet disappeared.</i>

510
00:38:17,421 --> 00:38:19,840
It doesn't help even when I touch him.

511
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:23,802
Then the shelves toppling over…

512
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,054
Yeah. It was his misfortune.

513
00:38:28,432 --> 00:38:30,559
Why did it have to disappear now?

514
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:34,354
That's because Gyeon-U dislikes me.

515
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:38,859
However kind someone is to you,
you'll still hate it if you hate them.

516
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:40,444
It means nothing to you.

517
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:42,154
It's the same thing.

518
00:38:44,448 --> 00:38:46,992
Why are you being so dramatic?

519
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:50,037
I should've stopped when he caught on.

520
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:53,290
I should've looked for another way then.

521
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:56,585
I guess I got too greedy.

522
00:38:57,919 --> 00:38:59,921
"It's all for Gyeon-U's sake."

523
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:01,673
"So I have no choice."

524
00:39:03,884 --> 00:39:05,469
It was all an excuse.

525
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:08,638
There's no way I'm the only solution.

526
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:12,684
There is no one and only way
to save a person's life.

527
00:39:12,768 --> 00:39:14,686
I just wanted to be his amulet.

528
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:17,939
Even for just a while…

529
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:24,529
I wanted to be
an important person to Gyeon-U.

530
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:33,747
So what?

531
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,373
What's your plan now?

532
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,377
I'll find another way as soon as possible.

533
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:42,547
For now,

534
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:44,841
I prepared this just in case.

535
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:48,011
Right now, this is
the only countermeasure.

536
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:50,472
All right.

537
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:53,934
I'll put this in his underwear for you.

538
00:40:04,945 --> 00:40:06,238
I've pulled myself together.

539
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:10,325
I almost lost Gyeon-U
while chasing my own greed.

540
00:40:11,493 --> 00:40:13,453
No more clumsy act
about wanting to be his friend.

541
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,288
As the Heaven and Earth Fairy,

542
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:18,125
I'll focus on saving Gyeon-U only.

543
00:40:27,134 --> 00:40:30,262
Okay, he can go home
as soon as the dizziness goes away.

544
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:32,097
-Thanks a lot.
-No worries.

545
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,765
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

546
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,810
Let's go. I'll take you home.

547
00:40:37,561 --> 00:40:40,522
Good idea. Look out for him,
kid with a nice build.

548
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:42,232
I'll settle the hospital bill.

549
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:43,316
No, sir, you don't have to--

550
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,318
Shush it. I want to do this for you.

551
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:47,404
I'll kill you if you refuse.

552
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:48,864
Just say thank you.

553
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:50,365
Adults are rich.

554
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:56,329
The total is 498,000 won, please.

555
00:40:57,539 --> 00:41:00,041
-What?
-It's 498,000 won.

556
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:01,918
It's fine.

557
00:41:02,002 --> 00:41:03,378
It's okay. Let's go.

558
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,546
Four hundred…

559
00:41:10,594 --> 00:41:13,430
The amulets are being prepared.

560
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:16,391
<i>I want 100 as soon as possible.</i>

561
00:41:17,601 --> 00:41:19,728
The real problem is the Baby Ghost.

562
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:21,730
Come with me already.

563
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:26,902
Lady Fairy, get rid of a ghost for me.

564
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:29,613
Oh, my gosh.

565
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:32,199
Dear, you can't bring this in here.

566
00:41:32,282 --> 00:41:35,076
No, it's mine. Leave it alone!

567
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:39,623
She had a miscarriage
in the last month of her pregnancy.

568
00:41:40,457 --> 00:41:41,958
Poor thing.

569
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:43,752
She hasn't been
in her right mind since then.

570
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:46,463
All she does all day long
is walk around with that stroller.

571
00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:50,133
She recently picked up a doll somewhere

572
00:41:50,217 --> 00:41:52,010
and carried it around,
calling it her baby.

573
00:41:53,595 --> 00:41:55,722
I think that's when she got possessed.

574
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:58,099
She threw out the doll one day,

575
00:41:58,183 --> 00:42:01,978
and now she goes through trash
all over the neighborhood looking for it.

576
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,024
Jeez. Look at that smile.

577
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:08,068
She must've completely lost it.

578
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:11,154
She's not possessed.

579
00:42:11,238 --> 00:42:12,405
Take her to a doctor.

580
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:14,324
You didn't even

581
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:16,493
-take a good look at her.
-I'm a shaman.

582
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:17,786
I can tell at a glance

583
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:20,205
whether someone's lost their mind
or possessed.

584
00:42:21,248 --> 00:42:24,000
Maybe she's both possessed
and out of her mind.

585
00:42:24,084 --> 00:42:27,629
No way. Ghosts can't possess crazy people.

586
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:29,047
Why not?

587
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,508
How can a ghost take over
when there's nothing in there?

588
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:32,926
There's no mind to control.

589
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,346
It's the ghost that gets antsy.

590
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:39,140
"What's up with this person?"

591
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:42,519
"What's wrong that they don't fear me?"

592
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:49,109
<i>Give me back my baby!</i>

593
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:51,861
Why are you doing this?

594
00:42:58,702 --> 00:42:59,536
Dear.

595
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:01,454
Hey, dear!

596
00:43:02,831 --> 00:43:04,082
What does your baby look like?

597
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:06,126
My baby?

598
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:08,795
-She's pretty.
-Does she wear a blue dress

599
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:10,130
and a white blouse underneath it?

600
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:11,381
She's about…

601
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:14,092
this big and a bit dirty.

602
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:18,138
The blue dress sparkles.

603
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,057
<i>Her dress has too many holes.</i>

604
00:43:21,141 --> 00:43:23,351
I held the baby close
in case she felt cold.

605
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:28,565
It's the doll.

606
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:31,651
<i>I can do it.</i>
<i>I can get rid of the Baby Ghost.</i>

607
00:43:31,735 --> 00:43:32,736
Wait.

608
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:34,946
Lady Fairy.

609
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:46,166
-<i>Who is it?</i>
-Hello.

610
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:48,543
I'm a friend of Do-yeon's.

611
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,128
<i>I don't have friends.</i>

612
00:43:52,422 --> 00:43:53,423
It's me, Park Seong-A.

613
00:43:59,262 --> 00:44:00,096
Are you cosplaying?

614
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:02,015
I'm a shaman.

615
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:28,833
BAE GYEON-U

616
00:44:36,758 --> 00:44:39,094
Dang it. I answered the call.

617
00:44:40,804 --> 00:44:42,472
Hello? This is Gyeon-U's phone.

618
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:43,723
Hey.

619
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,435
What are you doing with my phone?

620
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:50,563
I didn't mean to answer it.
I just happened to…

621
00:44:52,941 --> 00:44:54,359
It must be a foreigner.

622
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:56,152
The name's in English. "H."

623
00:45:01,241 --> 00:45:03,118
Is it an important call?

624
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:04,619
Sorry, my bad.

625
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:06,871
Patricia's haunted?

626
00:45:06,955 --> 00:45:09,958
You feel suffocated and nauseous,
and your head aches, right?

627
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:12,627
It's all because of the Baby Ghost
stuck to that doll.

628
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:13,962
I'm not buying that.

629
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:17,340
You must have nightmares
where a newborn cries all night.

630
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:24,013
You should've sold it to me
when I offered a million won.

631
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,851
You speak like a true villain.

632
00:45:28,435 --> 00:45:30,520
Why are you suddenly showing
your true colors?

633
00:45:31,104 --> 00:45:34,149
It's hard to get Baby Ghosts to cross over
because you can't reason with them.

634
00:45:34,816 --> 00:45:37,026
Calming them so they fall asleep
and don't cry is the best bet.

635
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:40,238
And I just found someone
who can do that the best.

636
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:41,656
Who's that?

637
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:44,868
The mom.

638
00:45:47,287 --> 00:45:48,746
ARCHERY TEAM

639
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:49,831
Hui-na.

640
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:54,461
I'll be much more unhappy
than you want me to be.

641
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,421
Don't worry.

642
00:45:58,548 --> 00:46:00,925
You know good things never happen to me.

643
00:46:05,472 --> 00:46:06,764
Don't cry.

644
00:46:08,141 --> 00:46:09,476
Try to pull yourself together.

645
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:12,437
I'm sorry for…

646
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:16,316
Yet again, I…

647
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,244
What's her problem?

648
00:46:30,497 --> 00:46:31,956
I didn't mean to listen in.

649
00:46:32,749 --> 00:46:34,000
I happened to overhear.

650
00:46:34,501 --> 00:46:36,628
Why did she call in tears?

651
00:46:37,212 --> 00:46:38,213
To make you unhappy?

652
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:43,343
Why do you take such calls?

653
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:49,265
What was that about?

654
00:46:51,226 --> 00:46:52,519
She's a friend.

655
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:55,396
CHOI HUI-NA

656
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,065
<i>She was a nice person,</i>

657
00:46:58,316 --> 00:46:59,817
but she changed because of me.

658
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:03,988
So you two should stop too.

659
00:47:05,365 --> 00:47:06,407
It's okay to do that.

660
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:10,036
Keep your distance from someone like me.

661
00:47:11,955 --> 00:47:13,164
What?

662
00:47:13,248 --> 00:47:14,249
Hey, Ji-ho.

663
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:17,669
You really can do that.

664
00:47:20,463 --> 00:47:22,382
I won't resent you guys for it.

665
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:43,236
Is he actually crazy?

666
00:47:44,112 --> 00:47:45,113
<i>What if I refuse?</i>

667
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:49,951
Is my outfit not sending a clear message?

668
00:47:50,285 --> 00:47:51,536
I'll take it from you forcibly.

669
00:47:52,537 --> 00:47:54,747
If I don't, you'll keep suffering.

670
00:47:54,831 --> 00:47:57,667
Insomnia and chronic headaches
will keep troubling you.

671
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:01,546
It won't kill you,
but that's not the case for someone else.

672
00:48:02,422 --> 00:48:03,506
They'll die.

673
00:48:04,132 --> 00:48:07,468
What will only give you a headache
can cause accidents for that person.

674
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:09,762
You have lots of dolls.

675
00:48:09,846 --> 00:48:11,472
Give up just one for a friend.

676
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:13,683
-I'm not anyone's friend.
-Then be one from now on.

677
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:18,730
Be my friend.

678
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:25,486
You're unusually upfront.

679
00:48:26,029 --> 00:48:27,947
I see why the woodcutter
hid the fairy's clothes.

680
00:48:28,031 --> 00:48:29,741
You became

681
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:32,243
way too strong.

682
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:37,999
Thanks for the compliment.

683
00:48:44,756 --> 00:48:46,257
How you show up at school…

684
00:48:47,008 --> 00:48:48,718
Is that all fake?

685
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:55,433
Maybe?

686
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:01,064
<i>I bought Patricia second-hand.</i>

687
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:04,817
<i>My mom threw her out in secret</i>
<i>because she looked spooky.</i>

688
00:49:04,901 --> 00:49:06,486
<i>I guess that lady must've found her.</i>

689
00:49:11,491 --> 00:49:13,951
<i>I found Patricia by chance</i>

690
00:49:14,035 --> 00:49:15,536
<i>and brought her back home.</i>

691
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:38,434
You were in so much pain.

692
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:43,272
Why did you remain on this side?

693
00:50:02,542 --> 00:50:03,543
You're finally back.

694
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:06,170
What's going on?

695
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:09,257
Why are you here? Were you waiting for me?

696
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:10,341
Yeah.

697
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,845
Why? Did something happen to Gyeon-U?

698
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,139
I'd say

699
00:50:16,222 --> 00:50:17,598
something is about to happen.

700
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:23,020
I'll do it.

701
00:50:24,147 --> 00:50:25,273
Human Amulet.

702
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:38,202
<i>You went to great lengths for Gyeon-U,</i>

703
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:40,913
<i>and to be honest, I didn't really get it.</i>

704
00:50:42,123 --> 00:50:44,834
I'll be much more unhappy
than you want me to be.

705
00:50:48,296 --> 00:50:50,047
<i>But I got it</i>
<i>after spending time with him.</i>

706
00:50:50,131 --> 00:50:51,632
I want to do the same for him.

707
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:56,429
If he died like that,
it would torment me forever.

708
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:01,309
Human Amulet or whatever.

709
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:03,519
I can be one too, right?

710
00:51:05,521 --> 00:51:06,606
Well…

711
00:51:08,191 --> 00:51:09,192
I can't?

712
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:13,780
You can.

713
00:51:14,864 --> 00:51:16,157
If that's how you feel.

714
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:40,598
<i>For the poor, annoying punk</i>

715
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:42,517
<i>who has no one to call his own…</i>

716
00:51:44,811 --> 00:51:45,978
<i>You'll be a shaman…</i>

717
00:51:48,064 --> 00:51:49,524
<i>and I'll be his Human Amulet.</i>

718
00:51:50,566 --> 00:51:52,985
<i>For now, that's all we are.</i>

719
00:51:57,198 --> 00:51:58,658
Something with eyes, a nose, and lips.

720
00:52:00,076 --> 00:52:03,329
-With eyes, a nose, and lips.
<i>-Give Gyeon-U something you touched a lot</i>

721
00:52:03,412 --> 00:52:05,873
<i>that has eyes, a nose, and lips.</i>

722
00:52:05,957 --> 00:52:08,000
<i>When you're not by Gyeon-U's side,</i>

723
00:52:08,084 --> 00:52:10,002
<i>that will protect him in your place.</i>

724
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:20,513
Eyes, a nose, and lips…

725
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:37,780
Hey.

726
00:52:37,864 --> 00:52:41,868
Why do you have eyes, a nose, and lips?

727
00:52:43,536 --> 00:52:45,454
Cherish it. It means a lot to me.

728
00:52:46,122 --> 00:52:47,623
I don't need it.

729
00:52:47,707 --> 00:52:48,708
Keep it, punk.

730
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:55,882
I didn't do my part in the assessment.

731
00:52:55,965 --> 00:52:58,968
-Let's work on it together all day long.
-I'm busy today.

732
00:52:59,594 --> 00:53:01,053
With what? Do it with me.

733
00:53:04,432 --> 00:53:05,641
Should I yell?

734
00:53:10,771 --> 00:53:13,941
Call when you're done with whatever it is.
I'll be waiting.

735
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:16,152
Hey, take this with you.

736
00:53:16,235 --> 00:53:18,446
Like I said, cherish it.
It means a lot to me.

737
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:23,576
Why is he so clingy?

738
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:45,222
Let's go.

739
00:53:45,932 --> 00:53:47,350
I'll take you to your mom.

740
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:49,018
Have you seen a woman

741
00:53:49,101 --> 00:53:51,479
in a flower-patterned dress
pushing a stroller?

742
00:53:57,818 --> 00:53:59,278
It's not her.

743
00:54:45,533 --> 00:54:46,742
Oh, my gosh.

744
00:54:49,704 --> 00:54:51,414
Where is she?

745
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:13,686
My baby's gone.

746
00:55:19,025 --> 00:55:21,360
My baby's not here.

747
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:55,895
<i>Let's say there's a stranger</i>

748
00:55:56,812 --> 00:55:58,230
<i>crying on the street, all alone.</i>

749
00:55:58,314 --> 00:55:59,732
My baby's gone.

750
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:00,816
<i>Even so,</i>

751
00:56:01,567 --> 00:56:04,403
<i>I want my crush to be someone</i>

752
00:56:05,029 --> 00:56:06,447
<i>who'd go over and comfort them.</i>

753
00:56:07,156 --> 00:56:08,657
<i>I'd just stand there</i>

754
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:11,327
<i>until they stop crying.</i>

755
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:19,168
<i>I can stand by their side</i>
<i>even if I don't know why they're crying.</i>

756
00:56:36,018 --> 00:56:37,019
Are you done crying?

757
00:56:43,109 --> 00:56:45,152
You shouldn't touch that stuff.

758
00:56:45,236 --> 00:56:46,362
It's icky.

759
00:56:48,364 --> 00:56:49,782
Icky.

760
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:07,007
Let's go.

761
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:17,226
Hello.

762
00:57:18,519 --> 00:57:20,479
You have a lovely stroller.

763
00:57:21,063 --> 00:57:22,356
It's my baby's cart.

764
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,900
-Isn't it pretty?
-It is.

765
00:57:27,278 --> 00:57:28,863
What's that over there?

766
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,031
-What?
-What is that?

767
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:33,993
My gosh.

768
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:36,287
Your baby's lovely too.

769
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:38,455
My baby is gone.

770
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:43,210
My baby.

771
00:57:44,044 --> 00:57:46,422
Where have you been?

772
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:48,716
Mommy's been looking for you.

773
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:52,636
You sweet thing.

774
00:58:31,717 --> 00:58:34,053
<i>I see why you didn't leave.</i>

775
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:37,223
<i>You'd been looking for your mom.</i>

776
00:58:55,616 --> 00:58:56,825
<i>It's so strange.</i>

777
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:00,829
<i>Everything about the two is fake,</i>

778
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:03,832
<i>but that love alone is real and true.</i>

779
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,129
Goodbye.

780
00:59:50,212 --> 00:59:51,630
WASTE BAG, JANGAN CITY

781
01:00:10,316 --> 01:00:11,150
<i>Gyeon-U.</i>

782
01:00:13,694 --> 01:00:14,695
<i>Gyeon-U.</i>

783
01:00:17,573 --> 01:00:19,491
<i>Even if I wasn't a real friend…</i>

784
01:00:21,744 --> 01:00:23,120
<i>Even if it was all a lie…</i>

785
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:26,498
<i>And even if it was fake…</i>

786
01:00:31,211 --> 01:00:33,422
<i>My heart hurts so much.</i>

787
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:37,968
<i>Doesn't that mean my feelings</i>
<i>for you are real?</i>

788
01:00:40,804 --> 01:00:42,306
<i>It hurts so bad.</i>

789
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:45,476
<i>I really…</i>

790
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:49,188
<i>feel like I'll die.</i>

791
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:27,119
<i>So there was a reason you got gutsy.</i>

792
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:28,537
<i>I don't get you yet.</i>

793
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:30,289
Why are you nice to me?

794
01:02:30,372 --> 01:02:32,249
<i>Why don't you stop doing this?</i>

795
01:02:32,332 --> 01:02:34,084
<i>She needs to live a good long life.</i>

796
01:02:34,168 --> 01:02:35,419
<i>When she dies, she'll go to hell.</i>

797
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:37,921
<i>Why do I feel like something's off?</i>

798
01:02:38,005 --> 01:02:39,298
<i>Do you both think I'm stupid?</i>

799
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:41,467
<i>You're doing this</i>
<i>because Seong-A told you to.</i>

800
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:42,718
<i>Weaklings</i>

801
01:02:42,801 --> 01:02:44,261
<i>lose out eventually.</i>

802
01:02:44,845 --> 01:02:45,846
<i>It can't be.</i>

803
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:47,890
<i>No, you can't do that. Not…</i>

804
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:49,516
<i>Is what Seong-A said true?</i>

805
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:51,894
Just hate me.
