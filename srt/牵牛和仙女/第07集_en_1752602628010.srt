1
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,950
Help…

2
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,780
So people shouldn't be treated
as a means to an end.

3
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,910
-Why?
-What?

4
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,370
What do you mean, "Why?"

5
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,040
What aren't you getting about
not treating humans as a means to an end?

6
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,330
Sir. I'll go and get Jin-ung.

7
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,630
-Where…
-Hey.

8
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,380
Sir. I'll go help her out.

9
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:32,090
Why would you…

10
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,220
Hey.

11
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,470
-I'll bring them all back.
-What?

12
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,020
What was that?

13
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,350
Your group's really tight.

14
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,270
-But Jin-ung's in our group.
-But Jin-ung's in our group.

15
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,110
Those little punks!

16
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,320
Seong-A. Wait up.

17
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,490
They're so darn fast.

18
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,130
Wait.

19
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,460
I don't feel good about this.

20
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,550
-What's wrong?
-This path leads to the abandoned house.

21
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,050
Does it?

22
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,180
Then I'll go alone from here.

23
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,680
You have to be careful until tomorrow.

24
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,690
Here.

25
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,650
-What?
-I promised.

26
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,190
I saw Seong-A cry.

27
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,320
Like hell she would.

28
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,820
Seong-A never cries.

29
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,490
And I think she cried because of me.

30
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,250
Do you think she'll ever forgive me?

31
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,630
She was bawling.

32
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,040
Did she really cry?

33
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,920
Did you actually make her cry?

34
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,890
I'm like 99% sure it was because of me.

35
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,550
You jerk. Die, punk.

36
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,260
-Just die.
-Don't…

37
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,730
Oh, wait, no. You shouldn't die.

38
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:03,730
Don't die.

39
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,560
Darn it. You little…

40
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,320
Stop it already.
I won't make her cry again, okay?

41
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,450
I won't make her cry ever again.

42
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,030
I promise.

43
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,840
Hey, Jin-ung, breathe.

44
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,170
Jin-ung!

45
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,170
Release him already!

46
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,930
Kim Jin-ung. Hey, Kim Jin-ung!

47
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,140
Seong-A!

48
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,970
Why won't these doors open?

49
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,350
Seong-A!

50
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,020
Hey, let's use that rock.

51
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,570
The heck? It's dead heavy.

52
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,570
Hey, wait.

53
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,960
-Hey.
-Seong-A!

54
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,250
Darn it. Gyeon-U!

55
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,540
-Are you okay?
-Why are you…

56
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,670
What's the matter with you?

57
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,300
Hey, what's wrong?

58
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,550
What's happening?

59
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,890
Why are you here? It's dangerous in here.

60
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,680
-Get out, quick.
-You want me to leave without you?

61
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,930
I'm not such a selfish jerk.

62
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,400
And I had to come in
because you weren't safe.

63
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,560
I can only be safe if you're safe.

64
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:31,690
See? I'm fine.

65
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,110
Let's leave together.

66
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,190
Get the doors for me.

67
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,110
Let's get out quick.

68
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,750
This can't be…

69
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,250
Seong-A, the doors.

70
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,290
You really crossed the line.

71
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,220
Why the heck would she go inside?

72
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,510
I might die saving her spirit-daughter.

73
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,770
Give me that. That's what I'm here for.

74
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,730
-General…
-Let's hurry.

75
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,940
A person

76
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,820
shouldn't do this to another person.

77
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,950
I chose

78
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,450
the last offering for you myself.

79
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,460
The boy absorbed
his family's misfortune for ten years.

80
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,290
Eat him up whole

81
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,380
and be born again

82
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,920
as a great evil deity.

83
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,390
Why is it Gyeon-U again?

84
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,930
Because he's easy prey.

85
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,020
He has no one by his side.

86
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,060
Why would you go this far?

87
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,320
Just why?

88
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,150
Weaklings

89
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,240
are always the prime target.

90
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,800
Gyeon-U!

91
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,930
Pick a card while thinking of the one
you're to meet in the near future.

92
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,860
It's the Devil card.

93
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,990
They're like the Devil,
charming but also dangerous--

94
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,820
I'll think of the near future

95
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,570
and pick one more card.

96
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,500
"Death."

97
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,000
The loss of life.

98
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,470
The Death card
doesn't just mean one's passing.

99
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,680
An end is always followed
by a new beginning.

100
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,100
Death means rebirth, a new beginning,

101
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,180
and the time for a closure.

102
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,350
Finally,

103
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,480
he's coming.

104
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,490
Meet the devil and reach death…

105
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,700
You're pretty good.

106
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,200
I'm sure your business will thrive.

107
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:54,980
The evil spirit?

108
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,380
Hello, Shaman.

109
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,470
Get out of Gyeon-U's body.

110
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:32,930
Hello.

111
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,230
Leave Gyeon-U's body right now.

112
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:41,730
Get out now!

113
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,650
Darn it.

114
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,400
If I'm to get out,
I'd have to kill this body…

115
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,530
or you.

116
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,620
No!

117
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,410
Shut up.

118
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,290
Why are you so reckless?

119
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,670
You're a shaman.

120
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,300
Then you must know who I am.

121
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,460
Right?

122
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,270
Come on, don't be like this.

123
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,560
Shouldn't you say hello back?

124
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,310
Go on.

125
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,170
Run.

126
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,720
What was that just now?

127
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,680
Come here.

128
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,570
-Leave. Get out of here, quick.
-What?

129
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,900
What the heck? Darn it.

130
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,990
Hey!

131
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,660
Don't try anything funny,
or I'll kill him!

132
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,950
No! Don't kill him.

133
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,450
I didn't try anything.

134
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,460
I think you're the one who did.

135
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,120
Like hell I did.

136
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,080
Explain what happened just now!

137
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,290
Run.

138
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,840
Go on. Get out of here.

139
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,010
That's not fair at all.

140
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,060
You think you can do whatever
because you're pretty?

141
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,980
Let's see…

142
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,650
How about we make a bet?

143
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,610
Shamans don't wager with ghosts.

144
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,900
The person who offered
this body to me is on the way.

145
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:56,410
If you catch me before she does,

146
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,780
I'll grant you a wish.

147
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,870
Any wish?

148
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,750
Yes, any wish. Whatever you want.

149
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,000
I'll do it.

150
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,760
Okay. Then…

151
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,340
Close your eyes and count to ten.
You've played hide and seek before, no?

152
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,010
Ready, go.

153
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,390
One, two…

154
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,850
Oh, and I hope you win.

155
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,680
I like you more than her, you see.

156
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,230
-Here goes.
-Three.

157
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,820
Four.

158
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,110
Five.

159
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,990
Six.

160
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,780
Seven.

161
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,700
Eight.

162
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,540
What happened? Are you all right?

163
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,540
Hey! Don't come in here.

164
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,750
Wait outside.

165
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,630
Nine.

166
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,340
Ten.

167
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,320
The thing that went by.
That's it, isn't it?

168
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,370
You two go ahead. I'll go after him.

169
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,920
-Let's go.
-Keep going.

170
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,470
Ma'am.

171
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:42,310
He's been afflicted, and one got possessed
and left. Please look after him.

172
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,560
We saw him on the way.
The General went after him.

173
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,270
You'll be too late
by the time you reach them.

174
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,350
Not if I run.

175
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,650
Fairy. Heaven and Earth Fairy.

176
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,770
Open your eyes and see what you've done.

177
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,240
Is he a fish?
Why did you pickle him with salt?

178
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,490
Even if you join the General,
you won't be helpful.

179
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,240
See what you must see,
not what you want to see.

180
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,000
Wake up!

181
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,290
BOK-I

182
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,050
Bok-i.

183
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:19,680
-We pray as one…
-We pray as one…

184
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,050
The evil spirit that dwelled in the shack
harmed that young man.

185
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,890
They refer to his state as "afflicted."

186
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,480
The shamans have begun
to cleanse him of it.

187
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,850
It's dangerous,
so it's best to keep your distance.

188
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,190
Shoo!

189
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,790
Here we go!

190
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,320
Why did you do this?

191
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,320
So I can live.

192
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,280
This is all so I can live.

193
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Shall I tell you
why your life is a living hell?

194
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,140
Don't touch me.

195
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,310
You dare pick up the bells
in your current state?

196
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,520
No wonder your life is hell.

197
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,150
You're no longer a person.
You've become a den for random spirits.

198
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,150
Let go.

199
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,410
Let go!

200
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:06,780
I don't want to.

201
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,330
Yeomhwa.

202
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,310
Yeomhwa, you foolish thing.

203
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,110
You poor thing.

204
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,280
Great job hanging in there, handsome.

205
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,860
Gosh, he has beautiful eyebrows.

206
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:47,990
You'll be fine.

207
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:50,200
-You got lucky.
-I'm glad you're okay.

208
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,620
But just to be safe…

209
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,160
Turn around.

210
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,500
Stop making contact with Gyeon-U
as his Human Amulet.

211
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,960
If you see him, don't go up to him.
Just call me right away.

212
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,380
-Why?
-I'll explain later.

213
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,300
Go straight home
instead of looking for Gyeon-U.

214
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,510
Why?

215
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:11,560
I'm swamped.
Protecting Gyeon-U is already a lot.

216
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,520
Are you saying I'm bothersome?

217
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,480
Seong-A!

218
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,980
I don't know where I'm going right now

219
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,610
-But I don't think to look around
-How do I get here?

220
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,040
I don't know the way
I'm stupidly clueless

221
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,540
I don't know
I'm clueless

222
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,330
I don't know the way
I'm clueless

223
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,090
Oh, shoot.

224
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,380
I'm lost

225
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,470
I can't go where I want to go

226
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,680
But I don't stop walking

227
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,760
I look straight ahead and go

228
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,600
-Earlier on… I think I'm at…
-I don't know the way, I'm clueless

229
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,270
You're getting on my nerves.

230
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,150
Your singing's just…

231
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,700
Go home!

232
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,120
MO BEOM
HWAMOK HIGH SCHOOL

233
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,800
Shall we see what's in Beom's bag?

234
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,800
Take everything that's worth anything.

235
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,090
-Okay.
-Okay.

236
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:34,430
To think we'd meet
a friend from middle school.

237
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,600
I'll pay you back when I can.
You know that, right?

238
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,780
-Jun-u, count it out.
-Okay.

239
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,440
-Hey, nice wallet.
-Nice.

240
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:50,700
Hey, there. Buddy.

241
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,070
Do you know how to get here?

242
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:52,990
Who are you?

243
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,370
You must've come from here too.
Do you know how to get there?

244
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,330
Hey.

245
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,120
Didn't you hear me?

246
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,170
Give me that.

247
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,800
Come on.

248
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,220
Hey. Why did you give it to him?

249
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,140
Thanks for… What?

250
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:21,890
Come with me.

251
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:26,860
I need to get to this place.
It's called Hwamok High School.

252
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,360
-Do you know where it is?
-What are you saying, Gyeon-U?

253
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,320
I don't know the way, you see.

254
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,110
-Come on, what don't you get?
-What are you doing?

255
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,570
-Where are you going?
-Jump him already!

256
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,450
Come on, tell me the way first. Don't go.

257
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,490
-Don't just stand there.
-Get back here!

258
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,420
How do I get to the school?

259
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,760
Hey, punk! Get back here!

260
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,100
Tell me where to go first.

261
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,180
-Come here!
-What?

262
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,180
-Let go of me.
-Gyeon-U…

263
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,560
-What's the matter?
-Come here.

264
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,820
CONTACTS

265
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,940
PARK SEONG-A SEONG-A

266
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,490
I'm swamped.
Protecting Gyeon-U is already a lot.

267
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,120
Why you…

268
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,330
What are you doing?
Are you out of your mind?

269
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:28,040
Are you a thug or what?
Why would you beat them up?

270
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,260
Hey. Are you with them?

271
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,680
What do you mean? I'm with you.
Partners in crime. We're friends.

272
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,470
PYO JI-HO
HWAMOK HIGH SCHOOL

273
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:43,770
"Friends"?

274
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,100
Yeah, we're friends.

275
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:49,020
In fact, I'm losing my mind here
out of concern for you.

276
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:50,980
Where did he go?

277
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,500
It's not him.

278
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,080
He must be where ghosts would love to go.

279
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,880
Somewhere dark, damp, and dank.

280
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,550
Where are you?

281
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,840
Did something happen
in the abandoned house?

282
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,930
What?

283
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,930
She was all about us teaming up
to save you not so long ago.

284
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:22,720
Then Seong-A said I should stay away
from you even if we met.

285
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,560
Just what on earth happened back there?

286
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,520
Nothing happened,
but something almost did happen.

287
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,320
What?

288
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,070
Wait, so the shaman told you
to stay away from me?

289
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,360
She must care for you a lot.

290
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,240
Here's the thing, buddy.

291
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,740
You should do as she says for now.

292
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,410
Right now, I'm a bit…

293
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,330
dangerous.

294
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,250
What's going on?

295
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,210
Why have you turned into an edgelord?

296
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,380
What is an edgelord…

297
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,590
Whatever.

298
00:20:58,970 --> 00:20:59,800
Do you like her?

299
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:05,060
Good for you.
The girl you like cares for you.

300
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,180
Hey, have you lost your mind?

301
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:10,150
I didn't tell you that I like her
just so you could tease me.

302
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,900
I was putting Seong-A first--

303
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,110
You don't just like her. You love her.

304
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,320
Come with me, you nutcase.

305
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,240
What do you like so much about her?

306
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,070
Are you into short girls?

307
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,310
I'll get more change. Wait right here.

308
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,730
No, come back here.

309
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,560
You want to keep playing?

310
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,360
Again? But you'll only get 6,000 points…

311
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,070
You're laughing?

312
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:58,490
Don't laugh. You're freaking obnoxious.
Do you know that?

313
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,990
Damn it. Were you always this annoying?

314
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,290
What are you looking at?

315
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,380
What are you doing?

316
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,510
Get out of my body.

317
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,430
I don't want to.

318
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:24,050
Didn't you see?
Even your friend couldn't tell.

319
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,260
-But--
-I think I can stay.

320
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,670
Get down!

321
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,800
Hey, move it!

322
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,550
Move!

323
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,600
Don't just stand there!

324
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,060
Get a hold of yourself, you idiot!

325
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,330
Please help!

326
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:31,950
I found you.

327
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,710
I won our game of hide and seek.

328
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:20,790
Now grant me my wish.

329
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,960
Please let Gyeon-U go.

330
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,300
The thing is--

331
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,260
You'd feel sorry for Gyeon-U too.

332
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,640
He walked into my shrine upside-down
when we first met.

333
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,930
People who do that
are destined to die within 21 days.

334
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:39,940
He had only 3 weeks to live
when he was just 18 years old.

335
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,730
I couldn't just let him die.

336
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,030
So I've protected him.

337
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,650
"Let's get him past those 21 days
and keep him alive at all costs."

338
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,700
Goodness.

339
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:53,080
What a pitiful kid.

340
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,540
You're wrong.

341
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:57,870
That in itself isn't pitiful.
He is just unfortunate.

342
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:02,210
What's pitiful is that the whole world
has been hating on him

343
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,050
and that made him hate himself too.

344
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:09,550
He doesn't love himself one bit.

345
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,600
That is what's pitiful about him.

346
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,310
Today's the last of the 21 days.

347
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:20,560
He can live freely after today, so please.

348
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,730
I beg of you. I need to save Gyeon-U.

349
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,660
Why would you go to such great lengths?

350
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,200
Because he's my first love.

351
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,540
Because I like Gyeon-U a lot.

352
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:45,050
Please help me.

353
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,390
Seong-A.

354
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,760
It's me right now.

355
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:59,480
-I'm Gyeon-U.
-What?

356
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,770
I'm Bae Gyeon-U right now.

357
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,740
What are you looking at?

358
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,160
It's me, Seong-A.

359
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:21,960
What the heck are you…

360
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:23,790
It's me.

361
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,590
-Gyeon-U?
-Yes?

362
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,480
What's this?

363
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,480
Hello.

364
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,830
Heaven and Earth Fairy, let go.

365
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,960
I don't think I should.

366
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,210
He's tied up anyway. Go on.

367
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,800
You shaman witches! Untie me this instant!

368
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:20,140
I'll just kill you all!

369
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,020
What are you? Are you a woman or not?

370
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,640
Put your hands back on him. Quick.

371
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,940
I didn't realize Human Amulet
was this effective.

372
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:33,490
He's Gyeon-U when touched,
and an evil spirit when not.

373
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:34,950
The vicious evil spirit

374
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:37,620
tried to possess him
but got locked up in there instead.

375
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,490
Even ten experienced shamans
couldn't have done it,

376
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,950
but these two teenagers
accomplished it somehow.

377
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:45,580
Don't make a fuss. He's still possessed.

378
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:48,540
It isn't over until we remove the spirit.

379
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,420
At least she found the evil spirit
and locked it up.

380
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,470
You know that's the hardest part.

381
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,840
Everything's ready.

382
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,970
Let's free the afflicted kid
from the spirit.

383
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,810
Let's begin.

384
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:07,150
Gyeon-U. Stay strong.

385
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:08,560
Okay.

386
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,570
Untie me, will you?

387
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,650
What are you…

388
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:17,200
-We pray as one
-We pray as one

389
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,120
-And wish with all our hearts
-And wish with all our hearts

390
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:25,000
-All the heavenly spirits and sages
-All the heavenly spirits and sages

391
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,830
-Please hear our plea and take pity
-Please hear our plea and take pity

392
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,000
-What are you even doing?
-All ghosts including the sinister ones…

393
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,590
That feels so good.

394
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:37,220
It's refreshing. Keep going.

395
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,510
Where are you going?

396
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,220
Hey, don't toy with food.

397
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:46,180
Don't do that. No. Don't.

398
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,060
-We pray as one
-We pray as one

399
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:53,480
-And wish with all our hearts
-And wish with all our hearts

400
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:57,150
-All the heavenly spirits and sages
-All the heavenly spirits and sages

401
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:01,120
It's tasty. Quite nutty.

402
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,080
What are you looking at?

403
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,910
I really hate that. Don't do that.

404
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,500
I don't like it! Don't!

405
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,080
Don't you dare. I hate it.

406
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:14,210
-We pray as one
-We pray as one

407
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:17,670
-And wish with all our hearts
-And wish with all our hearts

408
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,890
-All the heavenly spirits and sages
-All the heavenly spirits and sages

409
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:24,350
-Please hear our plea and take pity
-It tickles. It got inside.

410
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,020
-All ghosts…
-All ghosts…

411
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,850
Hey. This doesn't taste bad either.

412
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,190
What the…

413
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,690
What's the matter?

414
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,030
Where are you going?

415
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,290
-It's not working at all.
-Tell me about it.

416
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:49,660
We'll keep going until it works.

417
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:52,460
-Get more tofu and the five grains.
-Okay.

418
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,140
Hey.

419
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,930
Oh, my gosh!

420
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:09,060
Hey, you! Stop!

421
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,140
-Hey.
-Get him.

422
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,700
Seong-A.

423
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:31,000
Today's the last day.

424
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,380
You just had to pull through one more day.

425
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,880
I've tried so hard.

426
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:44,340
It's not fair.

427
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:49,850
This is just not fair at all.

428
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:15,580
Right now, the best option
is to lock up the evil spirit inside you.

429
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,720
I'm sorry I failed to help you
make it through today.

430
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,600
Don't be.

431
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,970
We're getting through today just fine.

432
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,430
Don't cry, okay?

433
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,020
I'm sorry.

434
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,980
I promised never to make her cry again.

435
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,240
I made her cry yet again.

436
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,660
I'm sorry, Seong-A.

437
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,410
I promise

438
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,040
not to make you cry ever again.

439
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,080
So please stop crying.

440
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:02,960
I just asked you to stop,
but you're crying even more.

441
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,840
Don't cry.

442
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,180
I wish I could keep them apart.

443
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,470
Are you all right?

444
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,310
Sure, I'm good.

445
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,520
I saw that done in a historical drama.

446
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,060
Dismemberment of the limbs.

447
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,490
We can't trust an 18-year-old boy.

448
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:26,150
This is the least I can do
to ease my mind a bit.

449
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,610
No, Mother.

450
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,160
This is a bit too much.

451
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,870
Be quiet and move.

452
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,330
Hey!

453
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,500
You old hag of a shaman.

454
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,880
Are you going to rip me to pieces?

455
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,960
-Exactly.
-Untie me!

456
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,290
Gyeon-U!

457
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:46,510
I'm sorry. Really, I am.

458
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,590
Why you…

459
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,600
I'm sorry.

460
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,180
I told you, didn't I?

461
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:01,150
Hey, kid.
No more than holding hands, got it?

462
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,070
Yes, ma'am.

463
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,480
Mother, please.

464
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:06,900
She has a point. You're going overboard.

465
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:07,860
Look at their faces.

466
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,700
He's out of her league.

467
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,080
-Master.
-Darn you.

468
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,200
Let's all go to bed.
It's late. Come along.

469
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:16,330
Hey, 18-year-old.

470
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,420
Hold her hand, nothing else.

471
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,460
Stay in the boundary we set up

472
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,630
and keep your eyes on the ceiling
like a proper gentleman.

473
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,670
Okay. I'll remember that.

474
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,130
Let's go. Even I'm sick of your lecturing.

475
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,470
So sick of it, really.

476
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,680
She's too much, right?

477
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,680
My gosh.

478
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:41,150
Mother's being dramatic, isn't she?

479
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,110
She's not.

480
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,020
Think about what happened
at the abandoned shack.

481
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:49,070
I totally understand
where she's coming from.

482
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,490
That was the evil spirit, not you.

483
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:54,450
As soon as you let go,
I'll become that evil spirit.

484
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:01,710
But I don't regret it at all.

485
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,920
I went in knowing it would be dangerous.

486
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,800
And even if I had known this would happen,

487
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:09,550
I'd still have gone in.

488
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,380
If I hadn't been there,

489
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,430
you'd have become the victim.

490
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,970
This is a thousand times better than that.

491
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:18,270
That's ridiculous.

492
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:19,730
It's not.

493
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:21,640
This is exactly what you always say to me.

494
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,610
Every archery arena

495
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,650
has good spots and bad spots.

496
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,030
Right now, I feel like

497
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,240
I'm standing in the worst spot
with the wind blowing in my face.

498
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,240
It's that bad.

499
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:40,210
But oddly enough, I'm not worried.

500
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:41,830
I think I can beat everyone.

501
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,170
Do you think you'll win gold?

502
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,800
Yeah, totally.

503
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:57,310
You sure are gutsy.

504
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:59,270
Why did you let that thing in here?

505
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:02,060
Should I have left her
on the street, then?

506
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,160
How is she?

507
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,370
She must've grown very weak.

508
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:19,290
She still hasn't woken up.

509
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:23,210
Even accumulating bad karma
requires a sturdy body.

510
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:27,630
She couldn't stand a touch of the sword
used to chase away petty spirits.

511
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:30,050
What made her think
she could commit all those evil deeds?

512
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,210
Isn't it obvious?

513
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,550
She was banking on the evil spirit
nesting in that shack.

514
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,430
Ma'am.

515
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:37,720
Don't you think General Dongcheon
is a bit strange today?

516
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:40,600
What? I'm not sure…

517
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:42,810
She's acting way too strange.

518
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:45,730
The young and handsome teen
may not be the only one that's possessed.

519
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,060
She must be possessed by something too.

520
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:50,530
Why else would a powerful shaman like her

521
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:53,700
keep an evil spirit and the shaman
who's served it in the same house?

522
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,660
It could be disastrous.

523
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:58,240
You're yapping away again.

524
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,700
She's done it before.

525
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,000
She tied my hands and feet,

526
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,460
gagged me with a cloth,

527
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,840
and hounded me mercilessly.

528
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,430
She's done it before, so she's confident

529
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,510
that she can do it again.

530
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,890
You should have let me die then and there.

531
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:25,810
Why did you let me live
knowing I'd become a problem?

532
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,610
You're at death's door,
but you have the energy to run your mouth?

533
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:36,360
I learned from the best.

534
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,130
This is nuts.

535
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,840
Why can't I fall asleep?

536
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,130
Shoot.

537
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,090
Where the heck did he go?

538
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,680
I found it.

539
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,690
HWAMOK HIGH SCHOOL

540
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,990
It's you, Gyeon-U.

541
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,910
Why are you here so early?

542
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:25,620
What?

543
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:29,450
No. I'm late.

544
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:31,950
I got here too late.

545
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:35,000
You little brat, talking so casually
like I'm your friend.

546
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,340
And you're dressed like a damn clown.

547
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:44,630
Just look at all this.

548
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:48,510
You'd find nicer clothes
in a clothing donation drop box.

549
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,720
You have horrible style.

550
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:56,440
I know you don't have many friends,
but find someone to help you buy clothes.

551
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,520
I could help, you know.

552
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,570
Look at you.

553
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,070
You finally look like
a Hwamok High archer.

554
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,490
Am I really on the archery team?

555
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,660
That's not how you speak to your elder.

556
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:10,030
Address me as "coach" or "sir."
Try it. "Sir."

557
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,290
Sir.

558
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:14,370
I'm on the archery team?

559
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,050
You're rushing it.

560
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,590
Give yourself more time.

561
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:27,800
What's wrong with his posture?

562
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,810
Darn it.

563
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:32,600
What's wrong with him?

564
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:58,000
Would you look at that?
My body knows what to do.

565
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,510
Hey!

566
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:07,930
I'm pretty good at archery!

567
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:15,930
Yes, ma'am. I've just arrived
at Gyeon-U's house.

568
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,140
I'll call as soon as I find him.

569
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:24,980
Gyeon-U. Are you in there?

570
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:32,160
Evil Spirit. Evil Spirit.

571
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,540
Evil Spirit from the Bongsu-dong shack.

572
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,790
I guess he didn't come here.

573
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,800
Bok-i, I'm sorry.

574
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,840
I need to sort this out
before I help Jin-ung.

575
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:51,550
What about me?

576
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:54,430
Jin-ung.

577
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,140
Am I supposed to follow her?

578
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,280
I heard it clearly.

579
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,780
She said "Bok-i."

580
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:22,790
It's only the morning,
but he's already annoying.

581
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,760
This is great fun.

582
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:45,610
Gyeon-U.

583
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,360
Hey, Gyeon-U.

584
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:51,950
Hey, partner.

585
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,960
What do you think you're doing?
Drop the bow!

586
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:16,640
Hey.

587
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:19,640
I've had enough of you.
Bae Gyeon-U, come over here.

588
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,480
-Everyone, gather around.
-Hey.

589
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,270
-Come here.
-You're not Gyeon-U, are you?

590
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:26,810
That's right.

591
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:30,610
What's going on over there? Why, you…

592
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:34,070
Hey!

593
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,490
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

594
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:38,160
It hurts.

595
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,750
What is it, Bok-i? What's over here?

596
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:43,660
Where? Right here?

597
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:44,670
What's going on?

598
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:45,960
Not here?

599
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:48,290
What's wrong, Ji-ho?

600
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:51,170
Gyeon-U.

601
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:52,170
Gyeon-U?

602
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,090
Gyeon-U kicked him.

603
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:55,050
He kicked him hard.

604
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:57,090
Gyeon-U? He was here?

605
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:58,800
He just ran off. Didn't you see him?

606
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:00,430
Thank you.

607
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:01,810
Wait. Stop.

608
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:05,350
You came to school like this?

609
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:07,770
In your pajamas?

610
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:23,830
So you'll do
a curse-cleansing rite for me?

611
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:26,750
If I don't release you
from all the layers of curse,

612
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,460
you'll wither away and die.

613
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,420
I can't let a person die on my watch.

614
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:34,090
"A person"?

615
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:37,550
Was I a person to you?

616
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:41,100
If you're a ghost,
let go of your grudges and cross over.

617
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:44,680
Human or ghost, I'll help you.
So don't complain.

618
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:48,020
You. Grab the drumstick.

619
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,020
You won't call a musician?

620
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:51,360
Everyone knows each other
in this line of work.

621
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,900
We'll keep it simple, just between us.

622
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:57,700
Goodness.

623
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,570
I'm not in the mood to play music.

624
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:03,240
I'll help you.

625
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,370
Don't worry.

626
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:17,050
Darn it.

627
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:29,900
What?

628
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:37,570
What do you want?

629
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:45,660
No!

630
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,460
You can't mistreat ghosts.

631
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,460
-Why not?
-He should've moved on but couldn't.

632
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,380
It means he has something to say.

633
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:02,180
We should hear him out so he can leave
with no regrets or grudges.

634
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:07,560
You're sweet.

635
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,390
But what's with the tone?

636
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:14,940
I'm done being polite.
You didn't keep our hide-and-seek deal.

637
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:16,900
Wait.

638
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,900
I'm a ghost too. Won't you be nice to me?

639
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:21,950
How shameless.

640
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:23,910
You ran off first thing in the morning.

641
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,790
Give me your hand so I can summon Gyeon-U.

642
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:30,580
No! Don't get in my way.

643
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:33,540
There's something I should do
with this body.

644
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:36,550
The only thing
a student should do is study.

645
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:40,170
-Cut it out and come along.
-Fine. Catch me if you can.

646
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:43,890
My goodness.

647
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:44,970
Hey.

648
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:50,020
I prefer the shaman.

649
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:52,480
Why you…

650
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,560
Get over here.

651
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:57,320
Come here right now.
Don't you dare run off!

652
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:08,620
Wait.

653
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:09,950
Is that a lovers' spat?

654
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,000
Hey.

655
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,380
-It's just a spat.
-I'll end you.

656
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:23,510
It's a dogfight.

657
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:29,270
Take my hand.

658
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:31,310
Call it a truce.

659
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:34,400
Holding hands is not a truce for me.
It's a surrender.

660
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,480
What's a truce for you, then?

661
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,980
Why bother with a truce?
Let's have a full-on war!

662
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:39,070
You're unbelievable.

663
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:43,700
Fine.

664
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:45,570
Tell me your name, then.

665
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,160
My name?

666
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:51,120
-I don't have one.
-You must have a name!

667
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,200
I don't because I forgot it!

668
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:53,370
Try to recall, then.

669
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,710
I can't keep calling you Evil Spirit.

670
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,460
Keep calling me that.

671
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:00,500
Who cares what you call me?

672
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:02,840
That's nonsense.

673
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,760
If you call something an evil spirit,
they'll become evil even if they weren't.

674
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:08,260
You may be an evil spirit,
but I can't call you that.

675
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:10,260
I should call you by a nice name
so you become nice.

676
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:13,980
Parents are super careful when they name
their babies for a reason.

677
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:16,690
Wait.

678
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,730
If you have no name, I'll give you one.

679
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,360
After all, names are given.

680
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,820
I'll give you a name.

681
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:33,410
Since you used to stay
at the abandoned shack in Bongsu-dong…

682
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,210
Bong-su. How's that?

683
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:37,920
-Shouldn't you put more thought into it?
-You don't like it?

684
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:40,380
Then…

685
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,840
Bong-su…

686
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,050
It's a pretty neat name.

687
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:49,090
Great, then. Bong-su it is.

688
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,310
Bong-su. From now on, you're Bong-su.

689
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,560
Whatever.

690
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:58,900
-Bong-su.
-Yeah?

691
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,230
Bong-su. Shall we play?

692
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:05,490
-Okay.
-Bong-su. Shall we play hide and seek?

693
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:08,160
I'd like that.

694
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,700
Now then, let's play.

695
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:15,500
What the heck?

696
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:30,340
If you call a ghost's name three times
and the ghost replies all three times,

697
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:33,680
they must submit to you
for a little while.

698
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:34,970
It's a simple Summoning Spell.

699
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:36,180
Darn you.

700
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:37,390
Bong-su.

701
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:38,890
Let's hold hands.

702
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:49,320
You gave me a really hard time this time.

703
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:53,990
What?

704
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,950
We can't go home right now?

705
00:49:57,330 --> 00:49:59,290
They're setting up a boundary.

706
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:01,130
She'll call you when she's done.

707
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:02,080
But…

708
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,250
That means

709
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:07,340
I have to keep my hands on Gyeon-U
so the spirit doesn't come out.

710
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:09,680
Lady Fairy. Good luck!

711
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:13,350
What's wrong?

712
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:19,940
It looks like
we'll have to stay like this all day.

713
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,940
I don't mind.

714
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:25,900
What if people gossip?

715
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,490
That's okay.

716
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:31,110
People pick on everything I do anyway.

717
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,280
No, wait.

718
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:35,740
If we're holding hands,

719
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:37,540
will they gossip about you too?

720
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,040
I wouldn't like that.

721
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:44,080
Let's see. What should we do?

722
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:49,130
-That's a bit awkward.
-Come this way.

723
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:53,720
No, this is too weird.

724
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,640
Behind the back like…

725
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,640
Our hands…

726
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:01,060
What should we do?

727
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:05,020
Oh, dear, Gyeon-U.
I hope you feel better soon.

728
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:07,900
That was close.

729
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:10,900
-Gosh. That was really close.
-My stomach hurts.

730
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:12,610
Hey, Seong-A.

731
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:15,950
Gyeon-U's sick, so I'm propping him up.

732
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:17,490
We're not dating at all.

733
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:19,160
How do you know Bok-i?

734
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:22,210
-What?
-Bok-i, my dog.

735
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:26,210
-Hey, where are your manners?
-What?

736
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:30,050
-Who are you to pick on me?
-I'm not picking on you.

737
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:32,170
-I'm asking nicely.
-Oh, you are?

738
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:35,180
Bullshit.

739
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:38,470
Guys, don't be like this.
Let's talk it out.

740
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:39,850
There's a fight!

741
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,520
Hey, they're fighting.

742
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:42,680
-A fight?
-Isn't that Gyeon-U?

743
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:43,890
Gyeon-U.

744
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:45,900
-Why are they fighting?
-I don't know.

745
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:47,360
Ji-ho!

746
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,610
I need help.

747
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:49,780
-Seong-A.
-Help.

748
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:51,190
Help. Get rid of him now.

749
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:09,040
Seong-A. Are you okay?

750
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:12,380
Thanks a lot, partner.

751
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:13,630
What?

752
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:17,050
Hey, are you okay?

753
00:52:17,890 --> 00:52:20,100
Hey, stop right there!

754
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:23,520
How do you know Bok-i?

755
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:28,150
11TH HANRAGI ARCHERY COMPETITION

756
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:38,160
I got you, you punk.

757
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:42,580
It's over, guys.

758
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:49,460
Your dog, the white dog.

759
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:51,500
She wears a collar
with "Bok-i" engraved on the tag.

760
00:52:52,090 --> 00:52:54,340
She's always by your side,
keeping you safe.

761
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:55,720
-What?
-You--

762
00:52:58,010 --> 00:52:59,970
What? Everything's fine.

763
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:01,760
Don't worry. It's all good.

764
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:04,600
I'm letting this slide for her sake.

765
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,560
If you do this again, then I'll…

766
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,980
-Your hand.
-What?

767
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:11,110
Let go.

768
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:13,360
You little…

769
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:20,780
Your dog, the white dog.

770
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:23,120
She wears a collar
with "Bok-i" engraved on the tag.

771
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,040
She's always by your side,
keeping you safe.

772
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:29,120
"School."

773
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:31,920
Hwamok High School.

774
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:34,250
What great courage.

775
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:36,590
You're really something.

776
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:37,630
NAME:
SCHOOL: HWAMOK HIGH SCHOOL

777
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:39,430
"Name."

778
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:42,390
What was his name?

779
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,890
I forgot again. I keep forgetting.

780
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:46,600
I can't be bothered. You fill in the rest.

781
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,560
It happens if you have a lot on your mind.

782
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,730
Who cares about the name?
You want to enter. That's what counts.

783
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:56,400
What? He's entering a competition?

784
00:53:56,490 --> 00:53:57,320
Him?

785
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,160
Oh, hey. Our one-day teammate.
Good to see you again.

786
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:04,280
He will enter that competition?

787
00:54:04,370 --> 00:54:08,290
Yes. Our dear Gyeon-U
made a huge decision.

788
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,960
Choosing the Hanragi Archery Competition
to make a comeback

789
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,130
can almost be called an iconic move.

790
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:16,550
Wait, he's an archer.
Let's call it "an iconic shot."

791
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:19,380
-Don't come close.
-Are you serious?

792
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:20,970
What did I do now?

793
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:23,300
Why would you enter
an archery competition?

794
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:24,640
Take it back right away.

795
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,810
I'm not the one who said I'd enter.

796
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:27,980
He…

797
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:29,560
What's my name again?

798
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:32,020
-Bae Gyeon-U.
-That's it. Bae Gyeon-U wanted to enter.

799
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,940
I saw you fill in the form just now.

800
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:37,990
We made a deal. You don't know anything.

801
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:38,940
Stop lying.

802
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:40,280
Hey, one-day archery teammate.

803
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,280
Wearing our uniform
doesn't make you a full-time teammate.

804
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:46,240
Why are you raging over an archer
entering an archery competition?

805
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:48,370
I mean…

806
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:51,160
Sir. He…

807
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:55,670
I mean, Gyeon-U is in no condition
to enter a competition.

808
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:56,710
Forget it.

809
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:58,920
If you're so suspicious,

810
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:00,800
check for yourself.

811
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,520
Sir, can you hand me the form?

812
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:12,140
Okay.

813
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:13,900
Gyeon-U.

814
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:18,650
NAME: BAE GYEON-U

815
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:26,280
Excuse us, sir.

816
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:27,530
Sure.

817
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,910
-I'm so sorry.
-No, don't be.

818
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:31,830
Let's go.

819
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:33,120
Bye.

820
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:40,550
Oh, to be young and in love.

821
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:45,840
I made a deal with Bong-su.

822
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:47,850
Enter the Hanragi Competition.

823
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:49,810
A competition is the best way
to regain your form.

824
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:52,850
It'll be a lot of pressure,
but you need to face it head-on.

825
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:54,980
What is archery?
It's all about keeping composure.

826
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:57,690
"Bad-mouth me all you want.
You can't get to me."

827
00:55:57,770 --> 00:56:00,190
It's your chance
to prove that to the whole world.

828
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:01,110
Fill out the form.

829
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:04,910
Tell him you'll enter
and fill out the form.

830
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:08,660
This competition is important to me.

831
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,700
Hey, isn't archery a solo sport?

832
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:14,250
That means I have to participate.

833
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,170
Of course you may think
you're in it alone.

834
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:20,550
But if you turn to look behind you,

835
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:22,130
yours truly will be right there.

836
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:24,720
You're not alone.
Don't think that you are.

837
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,220
I'll participate as myself.

838
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,300
No matter what.

839
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:36,940
Let's make a deal, then.

840
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:39,610
-A deal?
-Yeah.

841
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:42,320
Lend me your body while we're at school.

842
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,610
Then I'll…

843
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,610
join this competition.

844
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:48,320
You'll have my full cooperation.

845
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:52,950
Is that self-affirmation?

846
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,500
That's very important.

847
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:55,710
Let me join in.

848
00:56:55,790 --> 00:56:58,920
You punk.
Give him your full cooperation, okay?

849
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,090
You are your only rival.

850
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:02,920
Fight him and win. Bring it, punk.

851
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,630
Come at me.

852
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:06,970
Let's do it.

853
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:08,800
Your deal or whatever.

854
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:16,060
We don't know what Bong-su is thinking.

855
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:20,610
But I thought I might have an advantage.

856
00:57:20,690 --> 00:57:22,520
Like it or not, we're sharing a body.

857
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,820
Don't try anything funny,
or I'll kill him!

858
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,410
It's too dangerous. Your life is at stake.

859
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:35,290
I'm pretty hard to kill.

860
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,580
Well done.

861
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:40,040
Because someone

862
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:43,000
has worked really hard to protect me.

863
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,510
When we hold hands tight like this,

864
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,810
it keeps me from thinking
that I might lose.

865
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,100
I'm actually really timid.

866
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:01,520
But…

867
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:03,270
I'm not afraid at all right now.

868
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:07,150
Because you're so warm.

869
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:10,700
Gyeon-U.

870
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:12,030
I like you, Seong-A.

871
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:15,450
Now, it's…

872
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:18,410
my turn to protect you.

873
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:31,470
I like you.

874
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:33,970
I mean it.

875
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:43,580
Are you having fun playing with kids?

876
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:45,210
It's too dangerous.

877
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:47,000
Do you know what drives me crazy the most?

878
00:59:47,090 --> 00:59:50,090
You shouldn't hold
someone's hand so recklessly.

879
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:54,300
Parents and children
are bound to break each other's hearts.

880
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:56,090
You gave up on me.

881
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:57,550
You ditched me for being unclean.

882
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:00,810
I can't find a way
to separate you and Gyeon-U.

883
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:03,350
Just trust me. I have a plan.

884
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,350
I must save only one of them?

885
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:06,690
That is too cruel.

886
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:07,610
Sorry.

887
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:10,400
I won't ever let go.

888
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:17,780
