1
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,530
Let go.

2
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,910
Let go of me!

3
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:17,290
Release me. Let go!

4
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,920
-I understand your sorrows.
-Let me go.

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,330
-But we must do this.
-Let go.

6
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,710
You'll die otherwise, Yeomhwa.

7
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:23,920
Let go of me.

8
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,630
Let me go. Untie me, please.

9
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,670
Untie me.

10
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,510
Release me.

11
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,390
Let me go.

12
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:36,220
Let go of me.

13
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:37,810
Let go.

14
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,810
Let me go.

15
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,190
<i>Come to me.</i>

16
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,910
Darling baby, come to me.

17
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,280
My dear baby.

18
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,370
Come back to mommy.

19
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,370
Come to mommy.

20
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,550
-Come to mommy.
-What on earth are you doing?

21
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,340
No! No, don't do that.

22
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,340
-<i>No one should've held that ritual then,</i>
-Mom.

23
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,760
-<i>including you.</i>
-Please don't.

24
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,470
-<i>It had to be stopped.</i>
-Mom!

25
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,850
Give my baby back to me, Mom.

26
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,270
Please.

27
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,190
<i>You brought a coffin.</i>

28
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:28,940
<i>You hadn't bought a single shoe</i>

29
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,490
<i>or even swaddling clothes for my baby,</i>

30
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,570
but you bought…

31
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,870
and brought a pretty coffin
that was just the right fit

32
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,750
for my baby!

33
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,710
It wasn't because I resented you
for leaving me, your spirit-mother.

34
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,500
Even a mother has to let her child go
after they have passed away.

35
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,010
The moment you turn the child into a deity
to keep them with you,

36
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,140
the bond between you two
turns into an ill karmic bond.

37
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,020
You'd only become a fraud shaman
by serving the wrong patron deity.

38
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,850
But what about the baby?

39
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,650
A ghost that dares pretend to be a deity

40
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,190
receives divine punishment.

41
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,530
They can't cross over.

42
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,490
They have to wander forever in limbo.

43
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,320
How could you do that to your child

44
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,240
just to save yourself from loneliness?

45
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,330
No!

46
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,580
You're wrong!

47
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,750
I could have found it.

48
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,290
I…

49
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,380
I could've found a way!

50
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,210
I could have…

51
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:39,050
I would've managed to protect my child,

52
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,260
whatever it took.

53
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,640
You couldn't have.

54
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,560
There's no way you could've done it!

55
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,230
Even I struggle to keep you safe.

56
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,190
There's no way
you could've protected your child.

57
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,030
Don't dig your heels in and let it go.

58
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,410
Ma'am.

59
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,160
Help me tie another knot.

60
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,250
Don't do it.

61
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,170
Stop.

62
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,250
Stop it.

63
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,840
Stop it.

64
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,550
Stop. Don't do it.

65
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,340
Hello.

66
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,720
I'll now begin Group Two's presentation
for the Life and Ethics class.

67
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,100
I'm Cho Hye-ri, the presenter.

68
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:28,650
Our group…

69
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,650
We can go ahead with your deal
starting tomorrow.

70
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,110
Let's keep him inside at school today.

71
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,820
I can't trust Bong-su.

72
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,190
Won't he get angry?

73
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,150
That's all the more reason
to keep him inside.

74
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,820
-We humans have dignity…
-Okay.

75
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:43,700
…because we have free will and autonomy.

76
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,830
As rational beings,

77
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,790
we set up rules and follow them,

78
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,790
-making us unique…
-How long will you stay like that?

79
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,710
-We have our reasons.
-Like what?

80
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,590
It's complicated.
I'll explain after class.

81
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,720
Go back to your seat.

82
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,140
-Hey.
-Don't. Return to your seat.

83
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,270
-Go back.
-Just go back to your seat.

84
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,520
According to Kant's personalism…

85
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,350
Kant…

86
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,860
-Hey.
-Kant argued…

87
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,110
Kant…

88
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,900
Well, Kant claimed…

89
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,070
HUMAN = MEANS X, PURPOSE O

90
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,780
Kant's personalism states

91
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,790
that humans should not be treated
as a means to an end

92
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,790
but as an end in themselves,

93
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,830
emphasizing human dignity.

94
00:05:59,030 --> 00:05:59,900
Done.

95
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,710
One day…

96
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,500
you'll bitterly regret
performing that rite for me.

97
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:18,840
Regretting is…

98
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,760
what you'll be doing starting now.

99
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:26,050
Flower Master,
drop the drumstick and come here.

100
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,190
Put her in the prayer room.

101
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,310
You won't kick her out?

102
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,440
Why would I kick her out?

103
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,280
I must get paid for my troubles.

104
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,700
Do you know how expensive
my curse-cleansing rites are?

105
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,910
You're talking about money right now?

106
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,330
You have my utter respect.

107
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,500
How much do you want?

108
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,420
You won't pay with money.

109
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,130
Pay with your devotion.

110
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,680
"Devotion"?

111
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,300
Devotion, huh?

112
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,390
You're always on about devotion.

113
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,600
I see it now.

114
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,270
You want your pathetic faux-mom role back.
Am I right?

115
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,740
Listen, General Dongcheon.

116
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,240
The mom who abandoned me…

117
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,530
At least I'm her flesh and blood.

118
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,330
But what are you to me?

119
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,410
Spirit-mother?

120
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,420
That's someone who helps another
receive and serve a deity.

121
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,840
And I ditched my patron deity long ago.

122
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,510
So you're nothing to me now. Just…

123
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,800
Just take my money.

124
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,720
It must be nice to be rich.

125
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,270
You abandoned me.

126
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,060
You gave up on me.

127
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,780
You ditched me for being unclean.

128
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,650
Why would you take me back
and use your energy on me?

129
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:15,000
You found my stand-in long ago.

130
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,750
You're plain despicable.

131
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,000
When will you abandon her?

132
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,760
She's at the age
where she'd start to disobey you.

133
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,180
That's too harsh.

134
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,680
Ma'am.

135
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,180
Do you want to make a bet

136
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,350
on whether dear General Dongcheon
abandons her or not?

137
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:48,950
Does it have to be you two?

138
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,780
What about me?
I was Gyeon-U's Human Amulet too.

139
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,870
Would you do it if you could?

140
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,660
-You bet.
-Ji-ho--

141
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,580
I don't like seeing you two holding hands.

142
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,620
People might think you're dating.

143
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,790
Wait. Are you dating?

144
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,960
No.

145
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,010
We're not dating. Absolutely not.

146
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,050
Did you have to say "absolutely not"?

147
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,770
We're in a dangerous situation
where Bong-su comes and goes.

148
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,270
Whether we're dating
or not isn't important now.

149
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,190
Of course, it is.

150
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,990
To be honest, I think it's important too.

151
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,620
Actually, I like Seong-A.

152
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,290
<i>Your dog, the white dog.</i>

153
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,500
She's always by your side,
keeping you safe.

154
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,500
No.

155
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,010
BOK-I

156
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:00,980
Thanks for earlier.

157
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,100
You're actually thanking me?

158
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,690
Did an alien take over your body?

159
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:07,980
You're hopeless.

160
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:12,700
I hated working with you, and I hope
we never work together again.

161
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,330
That's what I wanted too.

162
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,790
I'll give you a farewell gift.

163
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,170
No, thanks.

164
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,460
Just accept it!

165
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,630
I was always bothered by your messy hair.

166
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,000
Can you lose this ghost look?

167
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,170
I get a jump scare whenever I see you.

168
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,170
Not my business.

169
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,050
Keep still. I'll make you look pretty.

170
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,180
The other side too, like this.

171
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,890
This actually suits you. Let me just…

172
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,730
Let me see.

173
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,310
You look pretty.

174
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,020
-<i>Bok-i is by your side.</i>
-You look so adorable.

175
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:49,610
-<i>By your side.</i>
-This is amazing.

176
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,860
<i>By your side.</i>

177
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,200
<i>By your side…</i>

178
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,370
You look lovely.

179
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,450
Here. Let me fix this.

180
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,210
If I make them match like this…

181
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,230
Bok-i!

182
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:29,730
It was you.

183
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,490
Are you crazy?

184
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,330
You're the crazy one here.

185
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,670
It's so annoying.

186
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,170
Why is my only friend such a mess?

187
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,840
I should've chosen a lonely life
without friends.

188
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,470
You're a hot mess.
Why's your nose still up in the air?

189
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,180
Lie low and stay here, for goodness' sake.

190
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,640
I don't intend to leave.

191
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,320
-What?
-The evil spirit's right here.

192
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,440
So why would I leave?
It'd be a waste of energy.

193
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,490
What was all that fuss about, then?

194
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,030
It's what I always do.

195
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,490
Pushing her limits.

196
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,750
Like a test.

197
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,790
You're a beast.

198
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,840
You can't call yourself human.

199
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,840
Man-sik.

200
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,180
You shouldn't hold

201
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,430
someone's hand so recklessly.

202
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,190
But once you do, you must be
even more careful before letting it go.

203
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,480
I'll let go of your hand now.

204
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,860
Okay.

205
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,860
I really will do it.

206
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
Okay.

207
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,370
For real.

208
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,160
Okay. I'll…

209
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,040
I'll be back.

210
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,210
Okay.

211
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,420
Darn you, Shaman.

212
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,670
I almost pooped myself!

213
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,340
You might as well just go in with me!

214
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,680
Sorry.

215
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,390
Oh, my goodness.

216
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,520
Hey, you! This is the men's room!

217
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,310
A girl shouldn't be here. Get out!

218
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,520
Get lost, will you?

219
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,600
A girl?

220
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,230
There's no one else.
What are you talking about?

221
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,530
Right there. You don't see her?

222
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,860
Well, I guess

223
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,740
you've only managed to stay sane
because you can't see ghosts.

224
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,040
I can't write with my left hand.

225
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,750
Sorry.

226
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,060
My name is Bae Gyeon-U, ma'am.

227
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:12,810
Thank you.

228
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:33,710
-Isn't that too tight?
-It's to make sure it doesn't get loose.

229
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,920
<i>Actually, I like Seong-A.</i>

230
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,840
Like you said, liking her
made me play dirty.

231
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:28,510
To be honest, if I could have my way,

232
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,720
I'd ask her to be my girlfriend right now.

233
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,520
But I'm a threat for now,

234
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,350
so I'll find a way
other than physical touch.

235
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,650
But until then,

236
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,820
I'll hold your hand tight.

237
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,110
I won't ever let go.

238
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,950
He wasn't playing dirty at all.

239
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,120
He was so cool.

240
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,670
Not bad, Bae Gyeon-U.

241
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:03,920
Gyeon-U.

242
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,340
Yeah?

243
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,760
Don't you think
we can unwrap the bandage now?

244
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,060
What?

245
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,560
Oh, sure.

246
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,520
My hand is so clammy.

247
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,020
Your hand must be tired
from holding mine all day long.

248
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,270
No. I don't usually sweat much.

249
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,480
It's because I'm nervous.

250
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,120
-Let's undo the bandage.
-Okay.

251
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,540
You must've been surprised
to hear that I like you.

252
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,500
No, I wasn't.

253
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,420
I was just happy.

254
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,300
So tell me.

255
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,930
When did you start thinking I'm pretty?

256
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:53,760
What?

257
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,390
That's how it starts, right?

258
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,230
You keep looking at the girl
because she's pretty

259
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,730
and then fall for her.

260
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,310
I don't know. What about you?

261
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,280
You answered a question with a question.
That's sneaky.

262
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:08,610
But I already have an answer prepared.

263
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,240
It was from the start.

264
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,240
"The start"?

265
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,990
Yeah, from the start.

266
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,540
<i>The day</i>
<i>you walked into my shrine upside-down.</i>

267
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,710
I fell for you at first sight

268
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,250
because you were so handsome.

269
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,430
So you fell for my looks?

270
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,510
Yeah.

271
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,600
That's silly.

272
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,600
And then you said

273
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,100
<i>that you'd stand by others.</i>

274
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,310
<i>That you'd stand in silence</i>

275
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,190
<i>next to a crying person.</i>

276
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,320
That seemed like the best way

277
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,610
to console someone you don't know.

278
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,620
It's the kindest, warmest way.

279
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:58,660
That was a valuable lesson
I learned from you that day.

280
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,880
That's why you stayed by my side

281
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,500
even though I kept pushing you away.

282
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:13,890
I remember now.

283
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,350
You know,

284
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,520
the day

285
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,770
you patted me on my head.

286
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,400
<i>We were on the rooftop.</i>

287
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,690
<i>That day,</i>

288
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,320
I found you…

289
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:34,870
really pretty.

290
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,300
Hey!

291
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,640
Hey.

292
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,760
Ji-ho, are you okay?

293
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:41,810
Are you all right?

294
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,310
Seong-A.

295
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,320
There's something I must tell you.

296
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,530
I like you.

297
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,040
What?

298
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,050
DO-YEON = BOK-I

299
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,140
Could you sit a little further from me?

300
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,060
Why? Are you afraid of me?

301
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,730
Or am I sitting so close to you

302
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:34,740
that you feel uncomfortable?

303
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,200
No, it's not that.

304
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,570
You reek of cigarettes.

305
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,910
I have asthma, you see.

306
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:43,830
What?

307
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:48,120
So you're sick…

308
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,340
because I smoke?

309
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,920
You could say that.

310
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,820
I won't smoke again until the day I die.

311
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,240
So none of you can smoke either!

312
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,240
If I catch any of you smoking,
you're dead meat!

313
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,660
You're the only smoker here.

314
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,410
Jeez.

315
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,120
It's damn so loud, Beom.

316
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,490
Just take the call.

317
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,290
Oh, sorry.

318
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,500
I don't take calls from unknown numbers.

319
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,460
BEST FRIEND

320
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,050
Maeng Ju-seung.

321
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:18,090
<i>Oh, he picked up.</i>

322
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,550
<i>Hey, hold on.</i>

323
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,930
Hey, Beom. It's me.

324
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:27,220
<i>We parted in such a hurry yesterday</i>
<i>that I couldn't get your number.</i>

325
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,640
We hadn't met in a while
since middle school.

326
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,440
You know I missed you, don't you?

327
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,860
<i>The other number is mine, so save it.</i>

328
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,070
Give it to me, quick.

329
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,150
Okay, bye.

330
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,190
Hey, Beom.

331
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,950
<i>You're studying, right?</i>

332
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:44,110
Study hard. Good luck.

333
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,580
Did you see how he took my call?

334
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,460
We're the best of friends.

335
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,880
You really are the best of friends.

336
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,300
You transferred to Pyeongtan High School?

337
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,670
Hit me up if you have questions
about the neighborhood.

338
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,050
I know this area inside-out.

339
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,300
I'm good. I just needed Beom's number.

340
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,940
I don't know when it started.

341
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,490
But after Gyeon-U
transferred to our school

342
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,490
and you started crushing on Gyeon-U,

343
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,820
it became clear to me

344
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:28,240
that I'd already fallen for you.

345
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,040
I'm sorry.

346
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,040
I had no idea.

347
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:36,790
If I think about it,
I became Gyeon-U's friend

348
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,050
and became his Human Amulet
all because of you.

349
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,260
I like you, and your first love might die.

350
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,090
If he were to die,

351
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,050
you would be devastated.

352
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,350
He's your first love.

353
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:54,430
So I helped you protect your first love
and ended up making a fool of myself.

354
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,850
You and Gyeon-U hold hands,

355
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,650
and I just have to watch.

356
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,730
Hey.

357
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,320
You're not a fool. Why would you say that?

358
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,950
I know I'm late.

359
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:08,660
I know I'm being
so uncool and pathetic too.

360
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,120
But Seong-A.

361
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,330
Do you know what drives me crazy the most?

362
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,670
What is it?

363
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,800
The fact that even now…

364
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:28,180
you have to be holding Gyeon-U's hand.

365
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,140
Sorry. I…

366
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:37,100
I have no choice. Bong-su possessed me.

367
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,060
Sorry. I haven't exorcised
Bong-su just yet.

368
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,150
I'm really sorry.

369
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,860
Who confesses their love
in front of their rival?

370
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,200
Is this even a confession?

371
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,490
Isn't this an exorcism?

372
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,620
And you still think I'm not a fool?

373
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:53,910
I'm sorry.

374
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,250
Seong-A. Don't reject me yet.

375
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,420
I was too busy fighting Gyeon-U's fate

376
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,380
that I never got to fight him for you.

377
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,260
I can't give up like this just yet.

378
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,340
Even if I get rejected,

379
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:12,220
I want it to be
after Bong-su or Bong-pal is gone.

380
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,350
Okay?

381
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,390
Then…

382
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,270
First of all,

383
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,730
thanks for telling me
about your precious feelings.

384
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,860
I mean it when I say this.

385
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,320
It's more than I deserve.

386
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,740
Don't be so nice.

387
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,570
I'll fall for you even more.

388
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,820
Yeah, don't be so nice.

389
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:35,910
Can't you just pretend you're not there?

390
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:37,700
Fine.

391
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:39,920
Here's a suggestion.

392
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,500
Let's keep our first loves
on hold for now.

393
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:48,090
Once we get rid of Bong-su
and everything's back to normal,

394
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:50,340
-let's talk again then.
-Okay.

395
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:52,140
-Okay?
-Sounds good.

396
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,970
Good. Shall we all get up?

397
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,350
Gyeon-U has to pack his things.

398
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,730
Hey, Shaman. Give me just ten seconds.

399
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:05,440
You, partner. You're not a fool.

400
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,400
You're not a fool.
You're a massive pushover.

401
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,530
I just couldn't stand your pathetic tale.

402
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,110
Dude, don't insult fools, okay?

403
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,200
No, Ji-ho. You know that wasn't me.

404
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:20,120
Let go of his hand.

405
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:22,500
-Wait. That wasn't Gyeon-U.
-Please calm down, Ji-ho.

406
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,840
-What did you just say?
-Calm down. That wasn't me.

407
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,840
-Come out!
-Ji-ho, don't.

408
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,760
Hey! You're absolutely a pushover!

409
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,130
What's so great about her anyway?

410
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,380
Hey, stop it!

411
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,090
Ji-ho, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

412
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:47,650
Darn it.

413
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,820
You perished like this.

414
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,240
My precious treasure number one.

415
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,570
Hey, are you okay?

416
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,750
It feels like my heart
is being ripped apart.

417
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,460
Thanks, Ji-ho. And I'm sorry.

418
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:09,420
-Seong-A, what about yours?
-Mine?

419
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,720
It's completely unharmed.

420
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:16,930
Sorry.

421
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,890
Don't be.

422
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,600
My love for Gyeon-U
wasn't as strong as yours.

423
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,020
Gyeon-U.

424
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,900
I'll love you even more now.

425
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,610
Thanks.

426
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,110
Shall we pack up and go?

427
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,570
Yeah, let's hurry.

428
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:34,610
Let's go.

429
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,490
Wait. Stop.

430
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,950
Do you two hold hands in bed too?

431
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:44,330
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

432
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,500
Doesn't it make it hard to fall asleep?

433
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:49,000
-How so?
-Not really.

434
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:52,010
No. It's not hard at all.

435
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:54,260
Why would it…

436
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,300
ever be hard?

437
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,850
<i>Ji-ho, that shrewd punk.</i>

438
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,900
<i>I should get rid of Bong-su soon.</i>

439
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,480
<i>This is pure torture.</i>

440
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,000
What the…

441
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,420
<i>Her sleeping habit is</i>

442
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,300
<i>too dangerous.</i>

443
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,800
Hang on.

444
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,730
JIN SOJU

445
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,860
Allow me just one bottle.

446
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,900
This is the best when you're frustrated.

447
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,850
When a person gets drunk,

448
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,810
they want to be honest.

449
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,360
Someone told me

450
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,070
that parents and children

451
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,410
are bound to break each other's hearts.

452
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:49,290
Parents break their children's hearts,

453
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,790
and children do the same
to their parents' hearts.

454
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,250
And they do so without realizing it.

455
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,970
You might not have birthed them,

456
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:03,390
but if they break your heart…

457
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,680
that means they're yours.

458
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:29,000
Ghosts are strongest
during the Hour of the Ox.

459
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,920
<i>She will make a move</i>
<i>to meet with the evil spirit.</i>

460
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:45,390
HOUR OF THE OX: 1:30 A.M. TO 3:30 A.M.
THE HOURS OF GHOSTS

461
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,660
Shaman.

462
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,380
When you're living with a ghost,

463
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,290
you should never sleep
during the Hour of the Ox.

464
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,920
Okay?

465
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,170
You idiot.

466
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,430
You're sleeping like a baby.

467
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,370
This is real.

468
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:05,510
If I touch you,
I'll turn into Gyeon-U, right?

469
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,680
You really are

470
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,100
something special.

471
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:28,780
Can I speak to you?

472
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,660
How diligent.

473
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,790
You're staying a while in him,
unlike the other offerings.

474
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,040
Usually, they lose their minds

475
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,880
as soon as I possess them.

476
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,710
But this kid is fine.

477
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,090
Maybe it's because of all his misfortune.
His body is pretty unique.

478
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:54,560
Please start preparing
to be my patron deity.

479
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,100
The longer you stay in a human body,

480
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:00,440
the more real the pain of death feels
when you leave it.

481
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,690
This amulet will ease the pain of death.

482
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,410
Have you died before?

483
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,160
Do you even know the pain?

484
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,120
I have been in pain

485
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:20,920
that was as bad as death.

486
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,340
Bullshit.

487
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,500
That's different.

488
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,350
Is it?

489
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,930
When shall I do the rite to receive you?

490
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,850
Oh, that?

491
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,230
Don't do it.
I'll stay in this body for a while.

492
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,820
How long do you mean?

493
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,820
I don't know.

494
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,610
About ten years at least?

495
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,120
You can't do that.

496
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,200
Then how about

497
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,410
20 years?

498
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:04,340
You know it's more fun
to bully the mean ones

499
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:06,340
than it is to bully nice ones, right?

500
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:09,010
Mean ones don't just give in.

501
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:11,430
They fight desperately.

502
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:16,180
And watching that is real good fun.

503
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:18,680
I wonder

504
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:21,190
where you would rank
among all the mean ones

505
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:24,690
that I've met so far.

506
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,150
You're number one.

507
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:36,830
You're the worst.

508
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,370
Do you want to vanish for good?

509
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,750
Look at you
showing your true colors right away.

510
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,340
You'll perish if you don't come to me now.

511
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:52,300
Come on.

512
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,300
I didn't say I won't come to you. I will.

513
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:56,550
But you see,

514
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,890
I don't want to now.

515
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,150
Do you know

516
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,360
if the "hwa" in Yeomhwa's name
means "flower"?

517
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,030
Her "hwa" means "ripe and beautiful."

518
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,280
Why do you ask?

519
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,910
Because she's screwed
like a plucked flower.

520
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:27,840
Why glare when I used nice words?

521
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,300
Flowers are…

522
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,470
She's such a nuisance.

523
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:53,610
"<i>Book on the Secrets of Thwarting Evil</i>"?

524
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,240
Goodness.

525
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,410
So she's reading this?
I guess she's a shaman after all.

526
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:10,710
What's this?

527
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,710
"The third day, the Hour of the Ox."

528
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:16,510
This means "day," not "ox."
She got the character wrong.

529
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:20,600
You need to be way prettier
to make up for your lack of brains.

530
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,100
Shall we say…

531
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,640
about twice as pretty?

532
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,820
Let's have a look.

533
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,110
What does this book say?

534
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,950
Did you enjoy the show?

535
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,660
Darn it.

536
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:43,790
What are you all doing there?

537
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:46,410
It looks like you'll be around
for ten more years.

538
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,080
You'll have to use up all your savings
to pay rent to me.

539
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,380
That's too bad.

540
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,760
I had my doubts,
but I didn't think it'd be this bad.

541
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,550
What do you think you're doing?

542
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,940
<i>I had particularly horrible nightmares</i>

543
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,530
over the last few nights.

544
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,150
Heaven and Earth Fairy
canceled all her appointments

545
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,660
and closed her shrine temporarily.

546
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,620
And it got harder to reach Dongcheon.

547
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:26,120
So I assumed
something must be going on here.

548
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:30,170
But turns out, you were creating problems
instead of handling them.

549
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:33,290
Big Sister. Please calm down
and hear me out--

550
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,000
I should have stabbed you in the neck

551
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:37,090
and not the eyes, shouldn't I?

552
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:39,380
Then you would've gone to the other side

553
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:42,510
where you could rest in peace
without having to see all this.

554
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,180
You'd be at peace.

555
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,730
-Oh, you can't see anything now either.
-Shut your mouth.

556
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,850
What's all this noise?

557
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,520
My child!

558
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:56,530
Why are you holding a ghost's hand?

559
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:57,900
Let go immediately.

560
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:01,700
Great Aunt. Gyeon-U isn't a ghost.

561
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,780
He is a ghost!

562
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:04,740
He's a deadly one, at that!

563
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:06,790
Get lost this instant!

564
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:09,500
This isn't a spirit you can handle.

565
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,670
Get away from him.

566
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,210
Let go of his hand.

567
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,090
You'll die if you don't let go.

568
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:15,090
Let go, or you'll die!

569
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:17,380
-Great Aunt.
-Let go, I tell you!

570
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,010
I don't want to. I won't.

571
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:20,220
Seong-A!

572
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,430
How dare you…

573
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,060
Who's this hag of a shaman?

574
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:33,270
Stay away!

575
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:34,940
Or I'll snap her neck.

576
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,400
You evil spirit!

577
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,780
How much evil did you commit
that everything's so dark?

578
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:40,990
You're in pitch-black darkness!

579
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,360
Ghosts with countless grudges.

580
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:45,450
-Some wish death, and some don't.
-That hurts. Hey!

581
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:47,290
-If you wish death, face me.
-Stop.

582
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:48,450
If you don't, run from me.

583
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:51,540
As the Head Ghost Hunter of the heavens,
I wield the Dragon Sword to defeat you.

584
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,830
-I told you to stop.
-A single blow shall do wonders!

585
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,920
Stop it. I said stop it!

586
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,750
-You little…
-Bong-su, no!

587
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:05,340
No?

588
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,350
Why not?

589
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:10,180
She tried to kill me, but I should stop?

590
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:11,890
Why can't I hurt her back?

591
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,310
You just can't.

592
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,230
Don't come closer. Don't move.

593
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,480
I told you not to move.

594
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:21,280
This isn't who you are.

595
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,860
Don't do this.

596
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:24,200
Hey.

597
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,450
The mountains shall shatter…

598
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,820
-Big Sister!
-Gyeon-U.

599
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,660
Great Aunt.

600
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:33,120
I apologize. I'll take care of it.

601
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:34,040
I'm sorry.

602
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:37,420
Get him. You can't let him get away.

603
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:45,970
What are you doing? Step aside.

604
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,220
What friend would let their friend

605
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,310
jump into a blazing fire?

606
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,890
A spirit that knocked out the elder shaman

607
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:55,230
can easily kill you where you stand, girl.

608
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,200
I wasn't going to go this far.

609
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,620
But I have to. Bong-su is too vicious.

610
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,160
What are you doing?

611
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,910
Seong-A. Listen carefully.

612
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,460
On my signal, let go of my hand,
go outside, and call me.

613
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:18,580
Wait outside
until Bong-su promises not to hurt anyone.

614
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:20,460
Don't you dare open the door before then.

615
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:22,380
And keep calling me, okay?

616
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,300
Here.

617
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:29,010
Sorry. I want to explain what I'm doing,
but if I do, Bong-su will catch on.

618
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,760
Just trust me.

619
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:32,850
I have a plan.

620
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:35,940
Big Sister.

621
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,320
My recitation of the sacred text
chasing away evil

622
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,860
should've given him unbearable pain

623
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,820
in all parts of his body

624
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,200
starting from the ears,
eyes, mouth, and nose.

625
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,410
But in his case,

626
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:52,030
only his ears hurt.

627
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:55,750
I've never seen something so menacing
in all 70 years of my life.

628
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:00,540
On three, let go of my hand and get out.

629
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:02,250
-Don't turn around.
-Okay.

630
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,550
One.

631
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,460
-Two.
-Two.

632
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,340
-Three.
-Three.

633
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,980
What the heck are they plotting?

634
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:17,640
BAE GYEON-U

635
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:22,730
What's that?

636
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,230
Stop it.

637
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,200
Hey! Stop it!

638
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,320
Stop! That's enough!

639
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:30,570
Turn it off, quick!

640
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,410
Don't do this. Stop!

641
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,990
Stop it!

642
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,040
Turn it off now!

643
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,040
Stop!

644
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,290
Don't do it!

645
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,460
Stop it, damn it!

646
00:41:58,310 --> 00:41:59,890
Hey, Bong-su.

647
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,230
Are you okay?

648
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:04,150
Stop it!

649
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,040
Bong-su.

650
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,040
Promise you won't do it again.

651
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:23,210
Promise you won't harm a person again!

652
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:33,220
Okay.

653
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,100
I won't.

654
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,350
I won't harm people from now on.

655
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,980
Say, "I'm sorry."

656
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,060
I'm sorry.

657
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:58,740
I've figured out how to handle Bong-su.

658
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:01,210
I'll do my best to keep him under control.

659
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,710
And if I think Seong-A will be in danger,

660
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:08,170
I'll tell you right away.

661
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,300
Your ears still hurt, don't they?

662
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,390
Yes.

663
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:20,100
That's <i>yeongcheong</i>.

664
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:21,980
Your ears have opened.

665
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:25,560
From now on, you will hear ghosts.

666
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:27,980
Hearing them isn't too bad.

667
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:30,030
You can still live among people.

668
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:34,160
Ears, eyes, mouth, and nose.

669
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,870
Ghosts take over your senses
in that order.

670
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,450
<i>Yeongcheong</i>. You will hear ghosts.

671
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:42,410
<i>Yeongan.</i> You will see ghosts.

672
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,670
<i>Yeongseol</i>.
You will share your tongue with them.

673
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:48,250
<i>Yeongbi</i>. You will smell ghosts.

674
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,670
Once you see ghosts,

675
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,590
the world you live in changes.

676
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:54,090
Start sharing their language,

677
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:57,140
and you will end up living
how the ghosts want you to.

678
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:59,060
Once you're able to smell them,

679
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,270
there's no turning back.

680
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:03,930
You become that ghost

681
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,350
and that ghost becomes you.

682
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:09,860
Whenever you sense a change in your body,

683
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,490
you must alert us.

684
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:16,110
Okay. I'll remember that.

685
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:18,070
Good.

686
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,500
Great Aunt. Can I ask for a favor?

687
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:25,160
-A favor?
-Yes.

688
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:27,170
I'm a shaman,

689
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:30,630
so I can hear, see,
speak with, and smell ghosts.

690
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:34,050
But you don't call me a ghost.

691
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:36,550
Gyeon-U can only hear ghosts,

692
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:38,590
and he's the one
who managed to subdue Bong-su--

693
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:39,970
I'm sorry

694
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,520
for calling you a deadly ghost.

695
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,560
I shouldn't have done that.

696
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,270
I apologize.

697
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:50,820
That's exactly what I wanted.

698
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,280
Please don't worry about it. It's okay.

699
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,320
I really don't mind.

700
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:00,320
I've been wanting to ask.

701
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:01,870
What are you doing here?

702
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:06,410
Oh, you met each other,
but you don't know each other's history?

703
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,960
No, Yeomhwa knows yours.

704
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,130
But you're rude as hell,
so you won't say hi, will you?

705
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:12,550
Heaven and Earth Fairy,
say hi to her first.

706
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,300
She's your spirit-sister…

707
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:16,420
No, they cut ties,
so she's your ex-spirit-sister.

708
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:20,430
Introducing Yeomhwa,
General Dongcheon's spirit-daughter.

709
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:24,430
She's doing all she can to stick around

710
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:27,100
and receive the evil spirit
in the young and handsome teen's body

711
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:29,020
as her patron deity,

712
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,480
but you don't have to mind her.

713
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,980
She's no more than a withering flower.

714
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:33,900
She's so screwed.

715
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:37,700
Yeomhwa. Why don't you take it as a sign
and change the "hwa" in your name

716
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:39,740
to the character that means "flower"?

717
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,070
Shut your mouth.

718
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:43,700
It's unbelievable.

719
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:45,450
A talking flower!

720
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,620
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

721
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:53,130
For how long were you going to
shoulder the burden alone?

722
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:54,880
I'm so ashamed that I have no words.

723
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:58,800
I'd like you to call me from now on.

724
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,550
Dongcheon isn't thick-skinned enough
to ask for help,

725
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:04,310
so she'll keep it to herself
and struggle alone.

726
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:05,260
Okay, ma'am.

727
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:06,430
Leave it.

728
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:09,190
I'll try to handle it on my own from here.

729
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:12,100
The law of equivalent exchange
is at the root of our profession.

730
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:14,020
You have just one life,

731
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:15,860
but you have two lives to protect.

732
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:18,650
Don't listen to her. I'm more senior.

733
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:20,700
Of course.

734
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,530
Go back inside, both.

735
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,200
No need to see me out.

736
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:27,790
<i>Bong-su.</i>

737
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,630
I can't say I'm sorry.

738
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:37,130
But I will make you this promise.

739
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,590
If you don't do anything,

740
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,430
I won't either.

741
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:49,350
That hurts.

742
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,400
-Does it hurt a lot?
-Yeah.

743
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:57,650
It's like he cried with this whole body.

744
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:01,280
You rarely say you're not fine.

745
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,910
Wait, Gyeon-U.

746
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,120
Bong-su.

747
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:10,830
He promised.

748
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:14,380
You almost killed Great Aunt.
You don't have the right to sulk.

749
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:15,330
Let it go.

750
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:21,010
I'll keep holding Gyeon-U's hand
at school, then.

751
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:22,630
I won't lend you his body.

752
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:26,430
Promise.

753
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,020
What do you want to do with his body
at school anyway?

754
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:43,780
There's something I must find.

755
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,540
You said you were looking for a name.

756
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,460
Why not go to the teachers' office
and look through old yearbooks?

757
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,130
Would I search for a name here

758
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,290
if it were in a yearbook?

759
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:04,090
You.

760
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,430
You need to become three times prettier.

761
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:08,800
Double the looks
won't get you anywhere, dummy.

762
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:11,560
The world would only go easy on you
if you were three times as pretty.

763
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:13,310
What?

764
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:20,900
Hey, it's time for archery practice.

765
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:23,650
You promised, remember?

766
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,870
Your upper body
shouldn't be stiff and tense.

767
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,670
Your legs should prop you up.
Relax as you draw the bow.

768
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:39,960
You should be relaxed to score high.

769
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:49,300
Gyeon-U.

770
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:51,060
This gesture.

771
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:53,640
Why do you do that?

772
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:58,150
It's a routine. It's a habit of sorts.

773
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:00,360
Does the routine help?

774
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,320
It's more like

775
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:06,570
I do it without thinking,
like how you breathe without thinking.

776
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:09,990
Hey, you punk.

777
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:13,240
The competition's around the corner.
Get a hold of yourself.

778
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:15,200
Who said you could date during training?

779
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:18,370
Since when do we shoot in pairs?

780
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:19,960
If you want to work in pairs,

781
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,670
switch to pair skating.

782
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,590
Coach. Nice one.

783
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:26,340
-Sir.
-What?

784
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:30,550
In that case…

785
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,640
Go ahead.

786
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,770
Coach. Are you stupid?

787
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:46,190
Oh, nice shot.

788
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,650
I knew it.

789
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:49,610
You talented thing.

790
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:51,450
Are you all stupid?

791
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,450
Try again.

792
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:57,290
HANRAGI

793
00:49:57,370 --> 00:49:58,410
D-7

794
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:13,260
HANRAGI
D-6

795
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,860
HANRAGI
D-5

796
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:48,670
Hey.

797
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:51,380
Why are you using <i>hanja </i>in your notes?

798
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:53,720
Because this is easier.

799
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:18,490
MEMORIAL STONE WITH NAMES
OF STUDENT SOLDIERS MOVED TO YUWOL PARK

800
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,250
They moved it.

801
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:35,140
How moist.

802
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,970
It reminds me
of being whipped with <i>minari</i>.

803
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,770
Are you having fun playing with kids?

804
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:47,980
Yeah.

805
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:49,820
It's fun.

806
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,240
It's about time you came to your senses.

807
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,540
If you stay in his body,

808
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,040
you might perish.

809
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,130
What if I do?

810
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:17,930
Do you have a way out?

811
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:19,810
Hey.

812
00:52:20,810 --> 00:52:23,640
You can't be a shaman
without me as your patron deity.

813
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:25,850
Did you forget we're bound by a spell?

814
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:29,730
So be nice to me, okay?

815
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:32,900
Guard me and look after me.

816
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,290
<i>What should we do?</i>

817
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,830
The competition is just around the corner

818
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:52,460
but I can't find a way
to separate you and Gyeon-U.

819
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:55,720
Come here. Let's have a look.

820
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,010
What are you doing?

821
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:05,100
You look a little prettier,
or maybe you don't.

822
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:07,560
What does that mean?

823
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,650
You idiot.

824
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:13,860
What good will staring at an open book do
when you can't read any of this?

825
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,910
This is about Human Amulets.
I know this part.

826
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:20,620
Do you? Then read this line.

827
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:22,490
What does it say?

828
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:28,080
It's not important.

829
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:30,170
You say that because
you don't know what it says.

830
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:31,130
Learn <i>hanja</i>, will you?

831
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:34,130
"<i>Eokmae</i>," how to suppress ghosts.

832
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:38,010
"<i>Eokmae</i>"?

833
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,680
You can't be a shaman
without me as your patron deity.

834
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:47,600
Did you forget we're bound by a spell?

835
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:58,400
<i>I wished for hell.</i>

836
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:01,700
<i>I vowed to be with you</i>

837
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:05,290
<i>when you end up in hell.</i>

838
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:08,830
<i>I made a wholehearted wish.</i>

839
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,080
How dare you…

840
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:16,340
use that against me?

841
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:20,300
He knows I can't break free from him.

842
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:24,510
I can't break free from him.

843
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:32,480
I can't break free from him.

844
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:41,950
I can't break free.

845
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,320
I can't escape.

846
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:49,410
I have no choice but to get closer.

847
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:54,000
I can get closer to him
than anyone in the world.

848
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:24,780
<i>"</i>Eokmae<i>," how to suppress ghosts.</i>

849

00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:28,950

<i>by becoming each other's Human Amulet.</i>

854
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,460
What if we do that every day?
Then you can never get out.

855
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:44,800
It can be done just once in a lifetime.

856
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:05,820
It's done.

857
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:19,170
Gyeon-U.

858
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:37,520
Bong-su can't show himself
until this time tomorrow.

859
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,230
But just to be sure…

860
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,440
take this lip balm…

861
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,710
Shall I put it on for you?

862
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,340
No, I can do that myself.

863
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,420
Okay. You do that.

JOONGHYUN HIGH SCHOOL

867
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:39,750
Lose the glare, Joonghyun High.

868
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:41,670
Are you the coach?

869
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:42,630
I'm in 10th grade.

870
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,340
Do they have two coaches?

871
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:51,470
Would you look at this?

872
00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:52,720
My gosh.

873
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:55,310
They assigned us the worst spot.

874
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,440
Are you okay?

875
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:07,320
Of course I'm okay.

876
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:09,740
Will you assemble my bow for me, then?

877
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:13,990
Give it to me.

878
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,200
Thank you.

879

<i>don't you think?</i>

886
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:46,860
The energy of the heavens, earth, sun,
and moon will bring silence and light.

887
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:50,700
May my spirit become one with the ghost's
and may our wills become one.

888

Let's go shoot some arrows.

-Good luck to you too, ma'am.
-Dude, I'm in 11th grade.

900
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:43,120
Instead of "ma'am," call them "senior,"

901
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:44,500
sir.

902
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:53,090
HWAMOK HIGH SCHOOL

903
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:05,850
The energy of the heavens, earth, sun,
and moon will bring silence and light.

904
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:08,730
May my spirit become one with the ghost's
and may our wills become one.

905
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:09,940
Gyeon-U.

906
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:11,690
Gyeon-U!

907

Hey. Seong-A.

908
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:17,240
Good luck, Gyeon-U.

909
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,420
-What?
-Can I…

910
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:27,290
Go. Be quick.

911
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:30,000
Get her to pat your back
and give you some good energy.

912
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:31,960
-Go on. Hurry.
-Okay.

913
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:36,090
You made it.

914
01:00:36,890 --> 01:00:37,800
How about a high-five?

915
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:40,010
Okay.

916
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:41,010
Here.

917
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:42,600
There.

918
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:00,660
What should I do?

919
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,950
What's wrong?
Do you think you can't win gold?

920
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,210
Are you that nervous?

921
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:13,920
<i>The energy of the heavens, earth, sun,</i>

922
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:15,590

923
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:18,180

926
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:28,190
<i>Ears, eyes, mouth, and nose.</i>

927
01:01:28,270 --> 01:01:30,110
<i>Ghosts take over your senses</i>

Yeongcheong. <i>You will hear ghosts.</i>

<i>Seong-A.</i>

931
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,160
<i>My eyes</i>

932
01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:45,330

933
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:39,300
<i>I will curse you.</i>

934
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:42,140
<i>I'm with her right now,</i>

935
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:44,140
<i>Do I have to choose one or the other?</i>

936
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:45,560
<i>Bong-su.</i>

937
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:46,930
<i>I want to stay by your side.</i>

938
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:50,230
<i>I merged my energy with his</i>
<i>with a Unify Spell.</i>

939
01:02:50,310 --> 01:02:53,150
Why didn't you tell me?
Why did you hide it from me?

940
01:02:53,230 --> 01:02:54,060
I thought

941
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:55,900
it was my fault too.

942
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,440
<i>It's okay if we're apart.</i>

943
01:02:58,490 --> 01:03:01,950
<i>There's usually just one reason</i>

<i>This is…</i>

945
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,990
Who is it? Who is counter-cursing me?

946
01:03:05,530 --> 01:03:06,910
<i>Something went wrong.</i>

947
01:03:06,990 --> 01:03:09,580
<i>Listen carefully, Handsome.</i>
<i>There will be a lot of pain.</i>

948
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:11,330
<i>Will I die?</i>
