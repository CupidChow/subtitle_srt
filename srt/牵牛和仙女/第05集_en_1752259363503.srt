1
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,230
What are you…

2
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,780
doing here?

3
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,030
Gyeon-U.

4
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Gyeon-U.

5
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,920
Gyeon-U!

6
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:06,190
I'll save him.
I'll fend off all misfortune.

7
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,110
I promise you to free him from misfortune
after the next three weeks.

8
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,730
Were you at the funeral?

9
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,940
Ji-ho. He filled me in.

10
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,030
I couldn't have been there.
I was so not there.

11
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,450
You little brat.

12
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,740
Do you think I'm here for you?

13
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,030
I'm here to see your grandmother.

14
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,790
<i>Bad accidents were like fate.</i>

15
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,750
<i>They were always waiting for me.</i>

16
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,960
<i>Lucky breaks were like a miracle.</i>

17
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,670
<i>They never happened to me.</i>

18
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,890
<i>A girl said she'd be there for me</i>

19
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,850
<i>until darkness gave way to light.</i>

20
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,850
<i>Her hands were so warm</i>

21
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,230
<i>that I thought I could be happy for once.</i>

22
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:51,650
<i>But it turned out to be</i>

23
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,530
<i>an impossible dream.</i>

24
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,490
Gyeon-U.

25
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,620
Bae Gyeon-U.

26
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,330
Gyeon-U.

27
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,050
I'm sorry, Gyeon-U.

28
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,720
Don't cry.

29
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,640
You don't get to snivel now.

30
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,960
Fancy meeting you here.

31
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,840
You ignored me?

32
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,510
You crazy?

33
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,100
Let's do this tomorrow.

34
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,220
Not tonight.

35
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,440
Have you really lost it?

36
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,780
What the heck?

37
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,380
What…

38
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,380
did I do to deserve this?

39
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,840
I didn't ask you to like me.

40
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,470
Hate me all you want.

41
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,180
You know I can't do anything
however much you hate me!

42
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,890
You could've

43
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,350
just gone on hating me

44
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,110
and loathing me.

45
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:58,280
Why are you taking it this far? Just why?

46
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,200
Just…

47
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,200
how much more pitiful must I be

48
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,410
to make you stop?

49
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,720
Gyeon-U.

50
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,090
Gyeon-U.

51
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,830
I'm sorry.

52
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,920
Damn it.

53
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,960
Go away!

54
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,170
Get lost!

55
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,050
Just go!

56
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,810
I wasn't saying that to you.

57
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,060
You really are a shaman, after all.

58
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,690
I can tell by your shamelessness.

59
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,820
You must've had fun.

60
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,200
It wasn't like that.
I meant to tell you from the start.

61
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,370
But I couldn't
because you hated it so much.

62
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,550
<i>You may feel sorry for me for now,</i>

63
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,800
<i>but soon, things will get real fun.</i>

64
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,390
<i>"You're plagued with misfortune."</i>

65
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,930
<i>"You're jinxed."</i>

66
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,140
"You'll die soon."

67
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,980
Taunting me with stuff like that

68
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,020
will become enjoyable to you.

69
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,200
<i>You'll see me struggle desperately</i>

70
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,580
<i>and do everything I'm told</i>
<i>as if I've become someone's marionette.</i>

71
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,250
<i>You'll end up laughing at me too.</i>

72
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,960
You try so hard.

73
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:03,210
You have no idea
you're a frog in boiling water.

74
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,670
I'm not like other shamans.

75
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,680
I know everything I say
will sound like an excuse--

76
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,140
They're not excuses.

77
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,810
They're lies.

78
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,180
Of all the things you said to me so far,

79
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,850
how many of them weren't a lie?

80
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,240
Who is it?

81
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,210
Who could be this vile?

82
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,050
<i>This boundary was made with the purpose</i>
<i>of making the one inside</i>

83
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,340
<i>an evil deity.</i>

84
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,930
<i>An exchange of equivalents.</i>

85
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,760
<i>The caster bet their own life.</i>

86
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,770
Be very meticulous.

87
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,230
<i>Seal the place from the outside</i>

88
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,110
<i>so not even an insect can crawl in.</i>

89
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,940
<i>If nothing can go into the house,</i>
<i>nothing will end up as a sacrifice.</i>

90
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,330
-<i>Close the door and seal it</i>
-<i>Close the door and seal it</i>

91
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:24,880
<i>With my bright energy I rebuke you</i>
<i>The sun rises in the east</i>

92
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,340
-<i>Close the door and seal it</i>
-<i>Close the door and seal it</i>

93
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,800
<i>With these amulets I command you</i>
<i>Release the inauspicious energy</i>

94
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,090
-<i>Close the door and seal it</i>
-<i>Close the door and seal it</i>

95
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,340
<i>The sun gives out fire of samadhi</i>

96
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,430
-<i>Close the door and seal it</i>
-<i>Close the door and seal it</i>

97
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,810
<i>It dims the ill light and subdues ghouls</i>

98
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:41,180
-<i>Close the door and seal it</i>
-<i>Close the door and seal it</i>

99

<i>Sacred warrior sent from above</i>

-<i>Close the door and seal it</i>

101
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,320

-<i>Close the door and seal it</i>
-<i>Close the door and seal it</i>

105
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,240
<i>And make everything fair and promising</i>

106
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:07,250
Just why isn't she picking up the phone?

107
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,340
What's wrong? Are you worried
Yeomhwa might have harmed her?

108
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,510
Watch it.

109
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,760
Master.

110
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,010
Why are you so worked up?

111
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,640
Your thoughts must be
going in that direction too

112
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,640
seeing how you keep calling her.

113
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,310
Wait.

114
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,860
-Do you hear that sound?
-What sound?

115
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,480
A phone ringing.

116
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,900
WOLSEONG SHRINE

117
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,450
SPIRIT-MOTHER

118
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,750
Seong-A!

119
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,130
You're back.

120
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,670
I see you've decided to torture me today.

121
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,380
Why didn't you answer your phone…

122
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,140
Why the long face? What's wrong?

123
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,060
-Mother.
-What?

124
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,560
At the abandoned house…

125
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,270
What about the abandoned house?

126
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,780
Did something happen?

127
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,990
Well?

128
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,410
At the abandoned house…

129
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:19,030
Go on. I'm listening.

130
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,700
I was found out…

131
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,790
to be a shaman.

132
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,710
Gyeon-U knows.

133
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,430
<i>It's an amulet</i>

134
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,430
<i>that wards off evil.</i>

135
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,140
You could've drawn it on my face only.

136
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,730
<i>In case she doesn't cross over.</i>

137
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,240
<i>She was with you for such a long time.</i>

138
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,320
<i>I did it to protect.</i>

139
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,740
To protect you.

140
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:06,040
I thought you'd be devastated
if you found out I'm a shaman.

141
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,080
I'm sorry

142
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,460
for wanting to be your friend.

143
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,350
BAE GYEON-U! SAVE HIM! PROTECT HIM!

144
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,140
<i>For just five days starting tomorrow.</i>

145
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,270
Stay friends with me
for just five more days.

146
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,770
You can hate me
and yell at me all you want.

147
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,190
Stay by my side for five more days.

BOOK ON THE SECRETS OF THWARTING EVIL

149
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,500
This boundary was made with the purpose
of making the one inside

150
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,750
an evil deity.

151
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,880
<i>Once inside, even the greatest shaman</i>

152
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,550
<i>will become a sacrifice.</i>

153
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:05,100
They'll be overcome
by the evil spirit and die.

154
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,220
Come on. Not just anyone
can become an evil deity.

155
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,890
They must kill 100 living people,
not just spirits, to…

156
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,650
No way.

157
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,360
Is it almost there already?

158
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,780
With just a couple left to go?

159
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,090
Did you ask her
if she met Yeomhwa at the abandoned house?

160
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,140
-Not yet.
-Why are you dragging it out?

161
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,510
Just ask her.

162
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:51,230
Good morning.

163
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:55,230
<i>-Dear viewers, our guest today</i>
-Did you see her yesterday at the shack?

164
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,310
<i>is highly sought-after.</i>

165
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,150
<i>Hello.</i>

166
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,650
<i>I'm Yeomhwa, a medium. Nice to meet you.</i>

167
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:03,650
<i>Before we start…</i>

168
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,740
-Yes, I saw her.
-You saw her?

169
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,700
What was she doing there?

170
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,120
Did she tell you anything

171
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,460
or perhaps harass you?

172
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,880
She didn't say much.
We just danced together.

173
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,880
You danced? Why?

174
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,630
She told me to dance
the Flower Lantern Dance.

175
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,350
That's a dance for two, so--

176
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,850
My goodness. You're really something.

177
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,890
You dared dance alone
with that notorious Yeomhwa?

178
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,020
It's worse than smoking with an elder.

179
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,360
General.

180
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,110
She'll become a great shaman. My word.

181
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,070
Shut your damn mouth, will you?

182
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,280
What's the matter?

183
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,280
She said she was one of the shamans
Great Aunt had called

184
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,490
and said she'd arrived a bit early.

185
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:53,330
That's a complete lie.

186
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,790
-What?
-Don't get me started.

187
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,670
Our elder shaman gathered
great shamans for nothing.

188
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,500
That witch beat us to it.

189
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,380
She cast a spell that turns anyone

190
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,510
entering the shack
into an offering to the evil spirit.

191
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,800
She even put up her own life.

192
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,970
The law of equivalent exchange.

193
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,760
We couldn't risk our lives,

194
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:14,140
so we sealed the shack from outside
instead of going in.

195
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,980
That reckless wench.

196
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,350
Why try to serve an evil spirit
and not just some ghost?

197
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,900
Doesn't she fear hell?

198
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,270
<i>Hell isn't far away.</i>

199
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,570
<i>Life as a shaman is hellish already.</i>

200
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,700
<i>Seeing ghosts isn't a skill or talent.</i>

201
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:31,780
It's a curse.

202
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,790
Stacking up karma with her tongue, I see.

203
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,880
ONE OF THE THREE KARMAS,
CAUSED BY ILL SPEECH

204
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,890
I'll get ready for school.

205
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,200
<i>Gyeon-U, I'm sorry.</i>

206
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,950
<i>Give me just five days.</i>

207
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:28,510
What's up with you two?

208
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,140
What's going on?

209
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,640
Nothing's going on.

210
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,390
Are you sure?

211
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,270
Yeah.

212
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,910
Seeing ghosts isn't a skill or talent.

213
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,410
It's a curse.

214
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,520
Patch things up.

215
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,890
I can tell you two argued.
Patch things up already.

216
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,350
Or it'll ruin our assessment.

217
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,320
We didn't argue.

218
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,320
Do you think I'm stupid? You argued.

219
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,490
Big time, too.

220
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,110
For the first time in my life,
I like your direct approach, Hye-ri.

221
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,330
Don't be silly.

222
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,620
If you two won't make up,

223
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,870
at least tell us why you argued.

224
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,710
It's been bothering me all day.

225
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:44,920
It's a personal matter.

226
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,670
It has nothing to do with you guys.

227
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,720
Come on, don't be like that.

228
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:58,140
I wish they didn't serve
braised beans at lunch.

229
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,230
Do you have to bring up
braised beans right now?

230
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,100
When can I talk about them if not now?

231
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,980
I should mention braised beans
when they're served.

232
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:13,530
If I were to say I hate braised beans
when they weren't served for lunch,

233
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,990
that's talking behind their back.

234
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,820
That's doubly hating on them.

235
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,950
I don't dislike braised beans that much.

236
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,040
But some may feel bad about it

237
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,670
and won't say they dislike
braised beans to their face.

238
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,290
They don't want to
hurt the beans' feelings.

239
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,670
They might whisper,

240
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,260
"I don't like braised beans,"

241
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,800
but I wouldn't assume
that they doubly dislike them.

242
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:38,800
Most likely their dislike
is only half the regular amount,

243
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:42,060
since they're keeping quiet
to preserve the beans' dignity.

244
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,520
What is she talking about?

245
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,980
If Seong-A is Gyeon-U's braised beans…

246
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,280
demanding he explain
why he dislikes his braised beans

247
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:59,660
is almost cruel to him.

248
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,720
I'm…

249
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,180
I'm a shaman.

250
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:25,230
I said I had a part-time job,
but I'm actually a shaman.

251
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,230
That shaman in the video
Ju-seung was on about

252
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,650
is indeed me.

253
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,400
I got initiated at eight,
and I've been a shaman ever since.

254
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,440
I didn't attend
elementary and middle school.

255
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:38,200
There were times when I wasn't a student,
but I was never not a shaman.

256
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,290
I wanted to be an ordinary student.
That's why I kept it a secret.

257
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,790
I swear it was never to deceive people.

258
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:49,670
Then I met Gyeon-U who hates shamans,

259
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,460
and I wanted to be his friend.

260
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,130
So…

261
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,470
ever since then…

262
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,680
I'm sorry.

263
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,180
I lied.

264
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,940
Then last night,
Gyeon-U found out the truth.

265
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,400
Can I ask you something?

266
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:19,490
Sure.

267
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:22,160
Why did you want us to be friends?

268
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:30,040
-Because--
-We can be friends with anyone we want.

269
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,540
Do we have to have a reason?

270
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:32,790
There usually is a reason,

271
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,710
especially for shamans.

272
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:47,680
He really does despise shamans.

273
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,190
Why don't you just tell him

274
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:53,230
that you're keeping him close
to protect him for 21 days?

275
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:58,740
But he was right about me
befriending him with an intention.

276
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,450
I guess, but…

277
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:04,530
"You're destined to die in 21 days."

278
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,290
Stuff like that…

279
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:10,500
should only be shared
after you've actually saved them.

280
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,420
Before then, you'd only be
scaring and threatening them.

281
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,460
I guess you're right, but…

282
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,470
How many days are left?

283
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,800
Five days.

284
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,550
That many?

285
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:33,270
How would you find Yeomhwa
when even I couldn't?

286
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,900
Have you lost all your powers?

287
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,030
Why waste time and energy
when you won't be able to find her?

288
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:41,570
Shush it.
Don't quibble about my decision.

289
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,410
I reached out
to all my emergency contacts.

290
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,950
Yeomhwa did some serious preparations.

291
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:53,620
She sold her house and her office
and canceled all her bookings.

292
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,670
She scraped together all her savings,
disconnected her number,

293
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,750
and went off the grid.

294
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,920
There must be something she still fears
if she has gone into hiding.

295
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,930
Do you really think so?

296
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:06,180
I'd say she cut contact
so no one would disturb her.

297
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,180
It's clear she's determined
to serve an evil deity.

298
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:14,140
All the more reason to find her, then.

299
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:17,230
I must find her
and knock some sense into her.

300
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:18,770
I'm off.

301
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:21,400
A typical behavior for a shaman
serving a general god,

302
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:23,530
jumping in like a good little soldier.

303
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,700
I wouldn't say anything if you served.
I'm the one who actually served.

304
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,910
Weren't you discharged
for medical reasons?

305
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,500
I got possessed when I was in the army.

306
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,620
I was supposed to say "attention"
in a manly voice when…

307
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,550
We'll finish making the slide deck today.

308
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,670
No one's going home until then.

309
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,090
And you two.

310
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,600
I won't let you sneak off
for archery practice or whatever.

311
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,510
Got it?

312
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:53,350
-Why's he the best archer?
-Darn it.

313
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,020
Let's go.

314
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:03,280
I won't let him catch on

315
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,900
that I knew you were a shaman.

316
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,570
If he found out
that I was in on it from the start,

317
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,450
-then he'd really have no one to turn to.
-Right.

318
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,160
I'll feel guilty for us both.

319
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,040
Stop feeling bad and protect him well.

320
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,380
Then get him to apologize
when the 21 days are up.

321
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,790
<i>Okay?</i>

322
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,800
It will take ages to make the deck.

323
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,680
Do you have business

324
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,810
with my legs?

325
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,560
No, it's nothing. Let's go.

326
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,150
It's still fast asleep.

327
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,610
My baby.

328
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,620
Where did my baby go?

329
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,820
My baby.

330
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,950
The baby's gone.

331
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,370
-That's dirty.
-The baby's gone.

332
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,500
Stop going through the trash!

333
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,710
Listen, dear. Your baby's not here.

334
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:02,630
Babies can't be out here.
That would be dangerous.

335
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,210
-Your hands are dirty.
-Where…

336
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,430
What's the matter?

337
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,300
-What is it?
-Wait.

338
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,060
Wait. Oh, my goodness.

339
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,640
-You thief!
-What on earth?

340
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,680
-What's wrong?
-Give my baby back to me!

341
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:19,520
What are you doing? Wait. Let her go!

342
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,900
-Do-yeon.
-What's wrong?

343
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,310
-You thief!
-Wait.

344
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,270
-Hey.
-Calm down.

345
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,780
-Stop it.
-Wait.

346
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,440
-Let go of her.
-Thief!

347
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:28,780
Calm down. Relax.

348
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,110
Oh, my gosh.

349
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,740
No, wait.

350
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:34,870
What's gotten into you?

351
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:40,170
Stop, you both!

352
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,510
<i>Don't look at him. Don't.</i>

353
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:53,470
<i>Loud noises wake the Baby Ghost.</i>

354
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,310
<i>A Baby Ghost isn't all that bad.</i>

355
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,780
What can a baby do but cry?

356
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,490
If it cries, comfort it.

357
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:12,490
But if you fail to do so…

358
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,740
<i>Then it'll be a disaster.</i>

359
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,460
<i>No, don't cry. He's not a bad person.</i>

360
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,380
<i>He's just plagued by misfortune.</i>

361
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,970
Peekaboo.

362
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:33,050
Peekaboo.

363
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,640
Thank you.

364
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,230
<i>Whatever. Human Amulet to the rescue!</i>

365
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,380
<i>Why did it shatter?</i>

366
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,800
<i>I held his hand.</i>

367
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,350
Are you hurt? Let me see.

368
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,520
It's okay.

369
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,310
-Hey, you're bleeding.
-I'm fine, all right?

370
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:29,020
Hey. Are you really okay?

371
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,360
It's a graze.

372
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,240
A little blow on it will do.

373
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,110
Are you okay?

374
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,490
-I'm so sorry.
-It's fine.

375
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,700
And you? Are you okay?

376
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:42,080
Yeah, I'm okay.

377
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,210
Why did the glass suddenly shatter?

378
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:46,500
-Beats me. But let's--
-I'm going home.

379
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:49,710
How can you say
you'll go home in this situation?

380
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,250
You said we could go when we were done.

381
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,130
All done.

382
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,180
LIFE AND ETHICS
PRESENTATION DECK

383
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,930
Do-yeon took care of the deck.

384
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,140
<i>Something's not right.</i>

385
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,770
<i>I need to look into it.</i>

386
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:09,400
You want to visit my place? But why?

387
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,730
I thought

388
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,780
it'd be nice if we became friends.

389
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,070
Why would that be nice?

390
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:19,070
It'd make more sense if you wanted
some tips from the deck expert.

391
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,030
Exactly. I want to learn from you.

392
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,500
Hello.

393
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,880
No one's home.

394
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,090
My parents both work.

395
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,340
This is impressive.

396
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:42,640
I'd like you to go into detail
about what you find so impressive.

397
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,520
Oh, well, you know…

398
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,020
I mean…

399
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,720
<i>So the ghost wasn't stuck to Do-yeon.</i>

400
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,550
You have a great eye.

401
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,100
This makes it much easier.

402
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,060
No.

403
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,940
Is 500,000 won too little?

404
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,060
Then…

405
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,400
how about a million won?

406
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,820
Patricia is my child.

407
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,400
Do you think I'll sell her for money?

408
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,280
I'll treat your child like my own.

409
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,570
I'll love and cherish it.

410
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,870
I fell for it at first sight.

411
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,700
Can you… Please?

412
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,620
You're lying.

413
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,300
You tried to obtain her with money.
That can't be true love.

414
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:58,670
Leave.

415
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,470
I'm her mom. You don't qualify.

416
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:07,560
Okay, I'll leave.

417
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,980
I'll leave for now.

418
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,060
Calm down.

419
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,300
<i>For just five days starting tomorrow.</i>

420
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,260
Stay friends with me
for just five more days.

421
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:46,010
<i>What in the world is she up to?</i>

422
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,200
Gyeon-U.

423
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,580
Hey, Gyeon-U. High-five.

424
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,420
<i>Is it pity?</i>

425
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:18,130
<i>It's friendship.</i>

426
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,960
<i>They were all spells.</i>

427
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:24,260
It wasn't pity or friendship.

428
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:28,180
You were just being a shaman
from the start.

429
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,370
Nothing's working out, huh?

430
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,000
Do you want an amulet?

431
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:55,830
The amulet…

432
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,790
The Human Amulet didn't work.

433
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,720
The Baby Ghost stuck to the doll
must be really powerful.

434
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:08,800
I need to get the doll

435
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:11,260
if I'm to perform a rite
and weaken its power.

436
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,440
Your power didn't work

437
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:19,060
on the boy who found out
you are a shaman?

438
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:22,230
-Yes.
-Then you don't yet know

439
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,700
if the Baby Ghost is strong
or you're plain weak.

440
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,450
Human or not, all amulets are the same.

441
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,830
When did your powers stop working?

442
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,080
Think carefully.

443
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:38,790
When do they stop working?

444
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,090
I wouldn't know.

445
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:41,880
My amulets are always effective.

446
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,670
What do you say?

447
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,430
Do you want a new one?

448
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,290
Let's stay moisturized.

449
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,660
Now, the social ideology…

450
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,990
This headache is so annoying.

451
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,290
Sir.

452
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,330
My head aches.

453
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,080
Mine too. What's going on?

454
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:04,630
Open the windows
and let in some fresh air.

455
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:30,740
Sir, can I go see the nurse?

456
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,240
Yes, go ahead. Be quick.

457
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,740
Let's sit up and stretch a bit.

458
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:46,210
Do-yeon.

459
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,590
-Did you think about it?
-About what?

460
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:57,010
About your doll.

461
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,560
Could you give it to me?

462
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:04,940
Hey, Ku Do-yeon.
Why did you spray water on her?

463
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,480
-Are you a sociopath?
-That's rich coming from you.

464
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:09,900
-What?
-Hey, don't fight.

465
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,190
I'm fine.

466
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,700
You keep quiet.
Do I have to be okay with it if you are?

467
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,620
-Let's work on our assessment.
-I am.

468
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,160
We're at the library. Keep it down.

469
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,460
You keep it down. You're louder.

470
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:25,710
And the second slide.
This isn't right. Fix it.

471
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,670
However loud I try to be,
I can't be as loud as you.

472
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,750
And…

473
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,300
as for the second slide,

474
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:32,880
you just don't get it
because you have poor taste.

475
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:35,430
What, taste? "Taste"?

476
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:38,390
-You are a sociopath.
<i>-It looks like it'll cry soon.</i>

477
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:41,060
-"Taste," my foot.
<i>-First,</i>

478
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,060
<i>whether it works or not,</i>

479
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,980
<i>let's try being the Human Amulet again.</i>

480
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,070
<i>Please.</i>

481
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,780
<i>Just one more time.</i>

482
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,610
<i>The spell.</i>

483
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,450
<i>Again.</i>

484
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,290
I don't know you well,

485
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:08,130
but I know about shamans.

486
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,130
You've been casting spells on me,
haven't you?

487
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,720
Is this how it works?

488
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,930
<i>How did you know?</i>

489
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,260
<i>What you're going through now</i>

490
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:23,430
<i>must be hellish.</i>

491
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:54,210
<i>The power of the Human Amulet</i>

492
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,840
<i>disappeared completely.</i>

493
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:01,890
<i>I can…</i>

494
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,430
<i>no longer protect Gyeon-U.</i>

495
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:16,280
JEIL GENERAL HOSPITAL

496
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,790
<i>Human or not, all amulets are the same.</i>

497
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,250
Think carefully.

498
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:31,080
When did your powers stop working?

499
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:40,970
Why are you here and not in bed?

500
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,970
I'm okay. I wasn't hurt.

501
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,480
Doesn't being here hurt your heart?

502
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,060
I brought it upon myself.

503
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,520
That's a stretch.

504
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,070
Do you want to lean on my broad shoulder?

505
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,120
No, thanks.

506
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:08,250
Oh, my gosh, Gyeon-U.

507
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:10,000
Oh, look at you.

508
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,540
Oh, Gyeon-U.

509
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,340
<i>My powers as a Human Amulet disappeared.</i>

510
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,840
It doesn't help even when I touch him.

511
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,800
Then the shelves toppling over…

512
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,050
Yeah. It was his misfortune.

513
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,560
Why did it have to disappear now?

514
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,350
That's because Gyeon-U dislikes me.

515
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:37,860
However kind someone is to you,
you'll still hate it if you hate them.

516
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,440
It means nothing to you.

517
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,150
It's the same thing.

518
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:45,990
Why are you being so dramatic?

519
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,040
I should've stopped when he caught on.

520
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,290
I should've looked for another way then.

521
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:55,590
I guess I got too greedy.

522
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,920
"It's all for Gyeon-U's sake."

523
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:00,670
"So I have no choice."

524
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,470
It was all an excuse.

525
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:07,640
There's no way I'm the only solution.

526
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:11,680
There is no one and only way
to save a person's life.

527
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:13,690
I just wanted to be his amulet.

528
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:16,940
Even for just a while…

529
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:23,530
I wanted to be
an important person to Gyeon-U.

530
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,750
So what?

531
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:34,370
What's your plan now?

532
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,380
I'll find another way as soon as possible.

533
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:41,550
For now,

534
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,840
I prepared this just in case.

535
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,010
Right now, this is
the only countermeasure.

536
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:49,470
All right.

537
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:52,930
I'll put this in his underwear for you.

538
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,240
I've pulled myself together.

539
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,330
I almost lost Gyeon-U
while chasing my own greed.

540
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:12,450
No more clumsy act
about wanting to be his friend.

541
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,290
As the Heaven and Earth Fairy,

542
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,130
I'll focus on saving Gyeon-U only.

543
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:29,260
Okay, he can go home
as soon as the dizziness goes away.

544
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:31,100
-Thanks a lot.
-No worries.

545
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,770
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

546
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,810
Let's go. I'll take you home.

547
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,520
Good idea. Look out for him,
kid with a nice build.

548
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:41,230
I'll settle the hospital bill.

549
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,320
No, sir, you don't have to--

550
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,320
Shush it. I want to do this for you.

551
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,400
I'll kill you if you refuse.

552
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:47,860
Just say thank you.

553
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:49,370
Adults are rich.

554
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:55,330
The total is 498,000 won, please.

555
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:59,040
-What?
-It's 498,000 won.

556
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:00,920
It's fine.

557
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,380
It's okay. Let's go.

558
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,550
Four hundred…

559
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:12,430
The amulets are being prepared.

560
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,390
<i>I want 100 as soon as possible.</i>

561
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,730
The real problem is the Baby Ghost.

562
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,730
Come with me already.

563
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,900
Lady Fairy, get rid of a ghost for me.

564
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:28,610
Oh, my gosh.

565
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:31,200
Dear, you can't bring this in here.

566
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,080
No, it's mine. Leave it alone!

567
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,620
She had a miscarriage
in the last month of her pregnancy.

568
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,960
Poor thing.

569
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,750
She hasn't been
in her right mind since then.

570
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,460
All she does all day long
is walk around with that stroller.

571
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:49,130
She recently picked up a doll somewhere

572
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,010
and carried it around,
calling it her baby.

573
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,720
I think that's when she got possessed.

574
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:57,100
She threw out the doll one day,

575
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:00,980
and now she goes through trash
all over the neighborhood looking for it.

576
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,020
Jeez. Look at that smile.

577
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:07,070
She must've completely lost it.

578
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,150
She's not possessed.

579
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,410
Take her to a doctor.

580
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,320
You didn't even

581
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:15,490
-take a good look at her.
-I'm a shaman.

582
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:16,790
I can tell at a glance

583
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:19,210
whether someone's lost their mind
or possessed.

584
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:23,000
Maybe she's both possessed
and out of her mind.

585
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:26,630
No way. Ghosts can't possess crazy people.

586
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:28,050
Why not?

587
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:30,510
How can a ghost take over
when there's nothing in there?

588
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,930
There's no mind to control.

589
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,350
It's the ghost that gets antsy.

590
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:38,140
"What's up with this person?"

591
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:41,520
"What's wrong that they don't fear me?"

592
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,110
<i>Give me back my baby!</i>

593
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:50,860
Why are you doing this?

594
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:58,540
Dear.

595
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:00,450
Hey, dear!

596
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:03,080
What does your baby look like?

597
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,130
My baby?

598
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,800
-She's pretty.
-Does she wear a blue dress

599
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,130
and a white blouse underneath it?

600
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:10,380
She's about…

601
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:13,090
this big and a bit dirty.

602
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,140
The blue dress sparkles.

603
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,060
<i>Her dress has too many holes.</i>

604
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:22,350
I held the baby close
in case she felt cold.

605
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,570
It's the doll.

606
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,650
<i>I can do it.</i>
<i>I can get rid of the Baby Ghost.</i>

607
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:31,740
Wait.

608
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,950
Lady Fairy.

609
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:45,170
-<i>Who is it?</i>
-Hello.

610
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:47,540
I'm a friend of Do-yeon's.

611
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:49,130
<i>I don't have friends.</i>

612
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,420
It's me, Park Seong-A.

613
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,100
Are you cosplaying?

614
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:01,020
I'm a shaman.

615
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:27,830
BAE GYEON-U

616
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,090
Dang it. I answered the call.

617
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,470
Hello? This is Gyeon-U's phone.

618
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:42,720
Hey.

619
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,440
What are you doing with my phone?

620
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,560
I didn't mean to answer it.
I just happened to…

621
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,360
It must be a foreigner.

622
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,150
The name's in English. "H."

623
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,120
Is it an important call?

624
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:03,620
Sorry, my bad.

625
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:05,870
Patricia's haunted?

626
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,960
You feel suffocated and nauseous,
and your head aches, right?

627
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,630
It's all because of the Baby Ghost
stuck to that doll.

628
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:12,960
I'm not buying that.

629
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:16,340
You must have nightmares
where a newborn cries all night.

630
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:23,010
You should've sold it to me
when I offered a million won.

631
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:26,850
You speak like a true villain.

632
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,520
Why are you suddenly showing
your true colors?

633
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:33,150
It's hard to get Baby Ghosts to cross over
because you can't reason with them.

634
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:36,030
Calming them so they fall asleep
and don't cry is the best bet.

635
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:39,240
And I just found someone
who can do that the best.

636
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,660
Who's that?

637
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:43,870
The mom.

638
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:47,750
ARCHERY TEAM

639
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:48,830
Hui-na.

640
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:53,460
I'll be much more unhappy
than you want me to be.

641
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:55,420
Don't worry.

642
00:45:57,550 --> 00:45:59,930
You know good things never happen to me.

643
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,760
Don't cry.

644
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:08,480
Try to pull yourself together.

645
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:11,440
I'm sorry for…

646
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:15,320
Yet again, I…

647
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,240
What's her problem?

648
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:30,960
I didn't mean to listen in.

649
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:33,000
I happened to overhear.

650
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,630
Why did she call in tears?

651
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,210
To make you unhappy?

652
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,340
Why do you take such calls?

653
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:48,270
What was that about?

654
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:51,520
She's a friend.

655
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,400
CHOI HUI-NA

656
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,070
<i>She was a nice person,</i>

657
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,820
but she changed because of me.

658
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:02,990
So you two should stop too.

659
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:05,410
It's okay to do that.

660
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:09,040
Keep your distance from someone like me.

661
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,160
What?

662
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:13,250
Hey, Ji-ho.

663
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:16,670
You really can do that.

664
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:21,380
I won't resent you guys for it.

665
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:42,240
Is he actually crazy?

666
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,110
<i>What if I refuse?</i>

667
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,950
Is my outfit not sending a clear message?

668
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:50,540
I'll take it from you forcibly.

669
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:53,750
If I don't, you'll keep suffering.

670
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:56,670
Insomnia and chronic headaches
will keep troubling you.

671
00:47:57,710 --> 00:48:00,550
It won't kill you,
but that's not the case for someone else.

672
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,510
They'll die.

673
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:06,470
What will only give you a headache
can cause accidents for that person.

674
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:08,760
You have lots of dolls.

675
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:10,470
Give up just one for a friend.

676
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,680
-I'm not anyone's friend.
-Then be one from now on.

677
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,730
Be my friend.

678
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,490
You're unusually upfront.

679
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:26,950
I see why the woodcutter
hid the fairy's clothes.

680
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:28,740
You became

681
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,240
way too strong.

682
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:37,000
Thanks for the compliment.

683
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,260
How you show up at school…

684
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:47,720
Is that all fake?

685
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:54,430
Maybe?

686
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:00,060
<i>I bought Patricia second-hand.</i>

687
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:03,820
<i>My mom threw her out in secret</i>
<i>because she looked spooky.</i>

688
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,490
<i>I guess that lady must've found her.</i>

689
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:12,950
<i>I found Patricia by chance</i>

690
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,540
<i>and brought her back home.</i>

691
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:37,430
You were in so much pain.

692
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,270
Why did you remain on this side?

693
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,540
You're finally back.

694
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:05,170
What's going on?

695
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,260
Why are you here? Were you waiting for me?

696
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:09,340
Yeah.

697
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,850
Why? Did something happen to Gyeon-U?

698
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:15,140
I'd say

699
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:16,600
something is about to happen.

700
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:22,020
I'll do it.

701
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:24,270
Human Amulet.

702
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:37,200
<i>You went to great lengths for Gyeon-U,</i>

703
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:39,910
<i>and to be honest, I didn't really get it.</i>

704
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,830
I'll be much more unhappy
than you want me to be.

705
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:49,050
<i>But I got it</i>
<i>after spending time with him.</i>

706
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:50,630
I want to do the same for him.

707
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:55,430
If he died like that,
it would torment me forever.

708
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,310
Human Amulet or whatever.

709
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,520
I can be one too, right?

710
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,610
Well…

711
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:08,190
I can't?

712
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:12,780
You can.

713
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:15,160
If that's how you feel.

714
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:39,600
<i>For the poor, annoying punk</i>

715
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,520
<i>who has no one to call his own…</i>

716
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:44,980
<i>You'll be a shaman…</i>

717
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:48,520
<i>and I'll be his Human Amulet.</i>

718
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:51,990
<i>For now, that's all we are.</i>

719
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,660
Something with eyes, a nose, and lips.

720
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:02,330
-With eyes, a nose, and lips.
<i>-Give Gyeon-U something you touched a lot</i>

721
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,870
<i>that has eyes, a nose, and lips.</i>

722
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,000
<i>When you're not by Gyeon-U's side,</i>

723
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,000
<i>that will protect him in your place.</i>

724
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:19,510
Eyes, a nose, and lips…

725
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:36,780
Hey.

726
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:40,870
Why do you have eyes, a nose, and lips?

727
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:44,450
Cherish it. It means a lot to me.

728
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,620
I don't need it.

729
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:47,710
Keep it, punk.

730
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:54,880
I didn't do my part in the assessment.

731
00:52:54,970 --> 00:52:57,970
-Let's work on it together all day long.
-I'm busy today.

732
00:52:58,590 --> 00:53:00,050
With what? Do it with me.

733
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:04,640
Should I yell?

734
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:12,940
Call when you're done with whatever it is.
I'll be waiting.

735
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,150
Hey, take this with you.

736
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,450
Like I said, cherish it.
It means a lot to me.

737
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:22,580
Why is he so clingy?

738
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,220
Let's go.

739
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,350
I'll take you to your mom.

740
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,020
Have you seen a woman

741
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,480
in a flower-patterned dress
pushing a stroller?

742
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:58,280
It's not her.

743
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:45,740
Oh, my gosh.

744
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:50,410
Where is she?

745
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:12,690
My baby's gone.

746
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:20,360
My baby's not here.

747
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:54,900
<i>Let's say there's a stranger</i>

748
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,230
<i>crying on the street, all alone.</i>

749
00:55:57,310 --> 00:55:58,730
My baby's gone.

750
00:55:58,820 --> 00:55:59,820
<i>Even so,</i>

751
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:03,400
<i>I want my crush to be someone</i>

752
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:05,450
<i>who'd go over and comfort them.</i>

753
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,660
<i>I'd just stand there</i>

754
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:10,330
<i>until they stop crying.</i>

755
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:18,170
<i>I can stand by their side</i>
<i>even if I don't know why they're crying.</i>

756
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:36,020
Are you done crying?

757
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:44,150
You shouldn't touch that stuff.

758
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,360
It's icky.

759
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,780
Icky.

760
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:06,010
Let's go.

761
00:57:14,850 --> 00:57:16,230
Hello.

762
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,480
You have a lovely stroller.

763
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:21,360
It's my baby's cart.

764
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,900
-Isn't it pretty?
-It is.

765
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,860
What's that over there?

766
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:30,030
-What?
-What is that?

767
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:32,990
My gosh.

768
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:35,290
Your baby's lovely too.

769
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:37,460
My baby is gone.

770
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,210
My baby.

771
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,420
Where have you been?

772
00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:47,720
Mommy's been looking for you.

773
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,640
You sweet thing.

774
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:33,050
<i>I see why you didn't leave.</i>

775
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,220
<i>You'd been looking for your mom.</i>

776
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:55,830
<i>It's so strange.</i>

777
00:58:57,410 --> 00:58:59,830
<i>Everything about the two is fake,</i>

778
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:02,830
<i>but that love alone is real and true.</i>

779
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:08,130
Goodbye.

780
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:50,630
WASTE BAG, JANGAN CITY

781
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:10,150
<i>Gyeon-U.</i>

782
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:13,700
<i>Gyeon-U.</i>

783
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:18,490
<i>Even if I wasn't a real friend…</i>

784
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:22,120
<i>Even if it was all a lie…</i>

785
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:25,500
<i>And even if it was fake…</i>

786
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:32,420
<i>My heart hurts so much.</i>

787
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:36,970
<i>Doesn't that mean my feelings</i>
<i>for you are real?</i>

788
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,310
<i>It hurts so bad.</i>

789
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:44,480
<i>I really…</i>

790
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,190
<i>feel like I'll die.</i>

791
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:26,120
<i>So there was a reason you got gutsy.</i>

792
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,540
<i>I don't get you yet.</i>

793
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:29,290
Why are you nice to me?

794
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:31,250
<i>Why don't you stop doing this?</i>

795
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:33,080
<i>She needs to live a good long life.</i>

796
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:34,420
<i>When she dies, she'll go to hell.</i>

797
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:36,920
<i>Why do I feel like something's off?</i>

798
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:38,300
<i>Do you both think I'm stupid?</i>

799
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:40,470
<i>You're doing this</i>
<i>because Seong-A told you to.</i>

800
01:02:40,550 --> 01:02:41,720
<i>Weaklings</i>

801
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,260
<i>lose out eventually.</i>

802
01:02:43,850 --> 01:02:44,850
<i>It can't be.</i>

803
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:46,890
<i>No, you can't do that. Not…</i>

804
01:02:46,970 --> 01:02:48,520
<i>Is what Seong-A said true?</i>

805
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:50,890
Just hate me.
