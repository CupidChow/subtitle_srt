1
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,310
All right.

2
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,930
Let's keep the lip balm.

3
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,550
Drink that. You seem cold.

4
00:02:58,850 --> 00:02:59,680
Thanks.

5
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,480
Leave it.

6
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,690
I'd rather not get it wet. I'm fine.

7
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,070
Well, I'm not.

8
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,150
I'll get another one.

9
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,150
No, I really…

10
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,530
Sorry.

11
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,830
Drink that. You might catch a cold.

12
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,030
What happened to these photos?

13
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,120
What are you doing?

14
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:03,870
Who did this?

15
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,710
No one should draw this amulet
on a person's face.

16
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,620
What are you doing?

17
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:10,500
Someone drew an Ward Off Evil Amulet
on the photo and erased it.

18
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,300
This is a spell to chase away ghosts.

19
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,840
You shouldn't draw it on a person's face.

20
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,510
I know that.

21
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,220
You do?

22
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,470
I do.

23
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,550
-And that's why I erased it all.
-Who told you

24
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,470
erasing it would cancel out the curse?

25
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:29,600
Drawing it on a living person's face
may not be all that terrible,

26
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,650
but it's a different story if the person's
been dead for less than 49 days.

27
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,070
It's asking the King of Hell
to curse the dead.

28
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,200
It's a strong curse
condemning your grandmother to hell.

29
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,700
Erasing it alone isn't enough.

30
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,950
So,

31
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,540
the target wasn't me

32
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,920
but my grandma?

33
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,920
These photos…

34
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,880
We must burn them, Gyeon-U.

35
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,850
What happened?
You look like you barely escaped drowning.

36
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,440
I told you it'd be a waste of time.

37
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,560
You really don't know
where Yeomhwa might be?

38
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,110
What are you looking at?

39
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,030
A photo album.

40
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,820
Your old photos.

41
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,040
Isn't my Seong-A adorable?

42
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,870
Are you cross-eyed?

43
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,920
<i>Erasing the ink won't undo the curse.</i>

44
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,720
A wish doesn't get canceled that easily.

45
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,680
A wish to cause harm to others

46
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,970
also counts as a wish, after all.

47
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,440
No wonder.

48
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:53,560
I thought it was weird.

49
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,110
My wish never came true.

50
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:02,490
I wished for an ordinary life
with my grandma, but that never came true.

51
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,410
That person's wishes
would always come true.

52
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,960
"That person"?

53
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,750
Do you know who drew these?

54
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,090
Can we meet them right now?

55
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,000
What if you do?

56
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:16,960
I'll ask them

57
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,960
to take back their wish.

58
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,760
We'll do a cleansing rite

59
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,930
and a rite to pray
your grandmother reaches the afterlife.

60
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,720
Then, you can keep these photos.

61
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,220
Sure.

62
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,940
She might grant you a favor

63
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,730
though she'd never bat an eye
even if I got on my knees.

64
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,570
You know the person who drew these.

65
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,610
It's the shaman you danced with.

66
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,120
She drew these.

67
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,830
<i>She said she was one of the shamans</i>
<i>Great Aunt had called.</i>

68
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,170
That's a complete lie.

69
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,080
That witch beat us to it.

70
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,420
She cast a spell that turns anyone

71
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,500
entering that shack
into an offering to the evil spirit.

72
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,050
I don't get you yet.

73
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,760
Why are you nice to me
when you're so close to Yeomhwa?

74
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,350
Are you two having fun together
toying with me?

75
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,730
By any chance,

76
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,150
if you're toying with me right now…

77
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,610
can you let me off just this once?

78
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:27,660
My grandma's photos…

79
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,120
really mean a lot to me.

80
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,420
I beg of you…

81
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,720
Heaven and Earth Fairy.

82
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,780
My hands are so cold.

83
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,780
I'm sorry.

84
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,590
I know you won't believe me…

85
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:27,380
but I met Yeomhwa for the first time
at the abandoned house.

86
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,220
She's really a stranger to me.

87
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,010
And I have

88
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,350
no plans or intentions

89
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,350
to toy with you or anyone else,
ghosts included.

90
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,860
I don't want to make others cry.

91
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,590
Isn't it good?

92
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,260
-Good choice, right?
-Where should we go later?

93
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,220
So you like it?

94
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,280
WHO IS IMMANUEL KANT?

95
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,530
How about this?

96
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,740
What?

97
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,290
Well…

98
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,370
It sucks.

99
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,620
That hurts.

100
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,880
So do better.

101
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,670
That's what people like you do.

102
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,090
I should be praised for doing it at all.

103
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,260
-Are you proud of that?
-I'm not ashamed.

104
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,800
You should be, though.

105
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,600
Are you ashamed of me?
Is that why you're so mean to me?

106
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,570
I'm not being mean at all. I just…

107
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,070
Hey, that's Gyeon-U.

108
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,570
What? Gyeon-U?

109
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,110
I'll be back soon.

110
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,660
What? Hey.

111
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,080
Where are you going?

112
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,200
To touch Gyeon-U.

113
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,080
To touch him? What for?

114
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,710
Gyeon-U!

115
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,630
You can't get on through that door.

116
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,670
Sorry.

117
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,580
It's pretty obvious he's off to see H.

118
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,670
I'd like to see her face.

119
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:08,340
And hurt her feelings while I'm at it.

120
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,970
I guess the family
just can't agree on anything.

121
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,970
I've opened this case so many times.

122
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,640
I won't be long.

123
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,520
<i>Ma'am. I just need to check.</i>

124
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,570
<i>She wouldn't have stopped</i>
<i>at drawing Ward Off Evil Amulet.</i>

125
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,530
<i>At least, I wouldn't have.</i>

126
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,860
<i>This is…</i>

127
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,530
What do you think you're doing?

128
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,150
Have you been well, Father?

129
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,490
<i>"Father"?</i>

130
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,830
Did you get permission before coming here?

131
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,710
-Go home.
-I want to talk to the shaman.

132
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,120
-What?
-I want to ask her something.

133
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:31,090
Go home for now. I'll call you.

134
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,000
I know

135
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,050
you won't call me.

136
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,720
The shaman is the only one
who has my number.

137
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,760
The rest of you didn't save my number
in case my misfortune rubbed off on you.

138
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,430
I can't reach the shaman.
It says the number has been disconnected.

139
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,850
I'm not asking this for my sake.

140
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,320
This is about Grandma.

141
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,070
You dare mention my mother?

142
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,700
I won't move an inch until you get her.

143
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,700
I'll speak with the shaman and then leave.

144
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:10,830
I won't approach or touch anyone else.

145
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,130
I won't answer even if I'm spoken to.

146
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,170
I promise.

147
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,180
Let's be honest.
She's adorable in this photo.

148
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,140
How exactly?

149
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,190
Where? Her gums?

150
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,100
You little…

151
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,570
Welcome back, adorable fairy.

152
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,910
I found a Ghoul-Making Amulet.
We must cleanse it immediately.

153
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,200
AMULET THAT TURNS A SOUL INTO A GHOUL

154
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,120
How did this vile thing
end up in your hands?

155
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,460
I know both the shaman who cast the curse

156
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,420
and the deceased who was targeted.

157
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,970
Then you do meet
the requirements for cleansing it.

158
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:02,430
But first things first. You said you knew
this shaman who made the amulet.

159
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,680
Why do you know them?

160
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,220
How do you know them?

161
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,310
It's Yeomhwa.

162
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,610
Yeomhwa is the one

163
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,570
who made this amulet.

164
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:19,860
<i>You're pretty gutsy.</i>

165
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,030
You want me to cleanse
the amulet on the photos?

166
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,580
Well…

167
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,410
My grandmother did nothing wrong.

168
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,250
It's not like

169
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,170
you were born a Newly-Dead
because you did anything wrong.

170
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,470
You're innocent too.

171
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,180
Just…

172
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:47,850
I'm begging here.

173
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,440
Don't you know what I do?

174
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:55,940
Misfortune will flock to you,

175
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,320
and blocking that is my priority.

176
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,740
Don't let the misfortune
seep into this family

177
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,070
and take it all with you, Newly-Dead.

178
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:26,090
So there was a reason you got gutsy.

179
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,720
Your grandmother died
because of you only recently,

180
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,510
but you found an ally already?

181
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:40,520
After I write this…

182
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:41,570
And then the final touch.

183
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,240
-Is that right?
-Yes.

184
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,000
Wait, but the lines…

185
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,580
Is this it?

186
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,590
Give it here. I'll do it.

187
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,130
You don't know the deceased.

188
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,050
Stay put. Seong-A has to do it.

189
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,470
Sorry.

190
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,850
I've made a lot of these,
but I've never cleansed one.

191
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,020
I didn't realize

192
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,890
you've had your spirit-daughter
curse others.

193
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,320
It was before I met Mother.

194
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,650
I was with my birth parents then.

195
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,910
Keep your focus.

196
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,910
I am focused.

197
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,450
I tried running just in case.

198
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,190
The curse on Oh Ok-sun,
born in 1951, the Year of the Rabbit,

199
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,610
shall be undone as of now.

200
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,900
May it be done immediately.

201
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,110
-May it be done immediately.
-May it be done immediately.

202
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:12,640
Well done.

203
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,760
You're good at this.

204
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,060
We'll wrap things up now.

205
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,770
You must be exhausted.

206
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,730
Go get some rest.

207
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,270
Yes. Rest up.

208
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:26,820
Thank you.

209
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,700
MISSED CALLS
PYO JI-HO

210
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,840
The cleansing.

211
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,380
Can't we do it out here?

212
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,970
We must do it inside. It's inside.

213
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,680
What's inside?

214
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,730
Something that doesn't suit a Newly-Dead.

215
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:09,650
Like pointless hope.

216
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,150
Give me the key.

217
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,980
I don't think he has it on him.

218
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,770
It must be somewhere here.

219
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,600
<i>Found it.</i>

220
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:34,860
Why are you so cruel?

221
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,820
-Who are you?
-What do you think? I'm Gyeon-U's…

222
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,990
I'm not his friend, exactly.

223
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:43,870
I'm a shaman.

224
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,330
So you gave him that.

225
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,370
I did not.

226
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,800
Keep it safe.

227
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,510
Don't let her take it from you.

228
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,170
Let's go outside.

229
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,340
We'll talk outside.

230
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,180
Why?

231
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,100
I'd rather stay here.

232
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,890
Fine.

233
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,600
Gyeon-U.

234
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,310
Will you wait outside?

235
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,480
I wonder.

236
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,990
What do you plan on saying…

237
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,160
that you can't let him hear?

238
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:25,830
It's just

239
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,250
some shaman stuff.

240
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,710
As fascinating as it sounds,

241
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,750
I want Newly-Dead to stay and listen.

242
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,880
Shall we cleanse them together
or will you burn them alone?

243
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,480
I'll just stay here.

244
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:52,560
You can talk.

245
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:53,900
It's fine.

246
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,030
Tormenting people must be your thing.

247
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,570
Not really.

248
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,080
I haven't really tormented people.

249
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,830
I control things that aren't people.

250
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:10,410
That's great.

251
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:15,960
I'm pretty good at controlling things
that aren't people too.

252
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,660
Gosh, how scary.

253
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,000
Sure, let's talk outside.

254
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,310
Will you stay standing there?

255
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:10,810
No.

256
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,850
But you are still standing there.

257
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,470
Are you out of your mind?

258
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,770
Why touch that tainted stuff
with your bare hand?

259
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:00,480
It can't be.

260
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:01,820
No, right?

261
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,070
It can't be what I'm thinking…

262
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:07,160
No, you can't do that…

263
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,290
I get your contempt for Yeomhwa,

264
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:19,500
but you shouldn't counter a curse
with another curse.

265
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,210
Did you get
your patron deity's permission?

266
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,920
Did the General give you the green light?

267
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,920
He said he'll punish me.

268
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:27,180
That's only right!

269
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:31,050
You want to use his great power
for something so vulgar as a curse.

270
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,770
No wonder the General God's angry.

271
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,270
So I said I'd accept the punishment.

272
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,110
What?

273
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,940
The Japanese said

274
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,990
that you dig two graves
when you curse someone.

275
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:48,320
One for the cursed and one for you.

276
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:51,950
To dig a grave for Yeomhwa,
I must dig one for myself.

277
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,370
Isn't that right?

278
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:15,890
"To kill"?

279
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:19,310
TO KILL

280
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,240
<i>I was at the columbarium.</i>

281
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,790
I took care
of the Ghoul-Making Amulet too.

282
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:40,750
I plan on doing my best
so Ms. Oh can cross over in peace,

283
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,250
so why don't you stop doing this?

284
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,460
Did you cause this fuss just to say that?

285
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,050
It's not "just that."

286
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:53,680
Humans are not like animals.
They feel emotions.

287
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,100
If you hit a mother,
only she will writhe in pain.

288
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,430
But if you hit her kid in front of her,
they both suffer.

289
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,350
In fact,

290
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,850
the mother suffers more.

291
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,770
Emotional pain is worse
than any physical pain.

292
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:11,910
So what?

293
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,780
You hurt Gyeon-U to get to his grandmother
and then hurt her to get to him.

294
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,870
That's how you've been
tormenting them, right?

295
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:21,960
I bet you won't cleanse the photos anyway.
You're going to burn them, no?

296
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:29,460
Why do you think so?

297
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,930
What shaman preparing a cleansing ritual

298
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,720
comes without cleansing water,
incense, or candles…

299
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,140
and only brings a lighter?

300
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,810
Are you the only shaman?

301
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,400
I'm a shaman too.

302
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,280
Not bad.

303
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,700
Is what Seong-A said true?

304
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:57,990
Were you

305
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:01,410
not going to cleanse the photos at all?

306
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:06,210
What do you think I'd have done?

307
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,990
If they must be burned, this is better.

308
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,530
I don't want
your dirty hands touching them.

309
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,420
If you insist,

310
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,130
I have no more business here.

311
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,800
I should go.

312
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:57,840
But Newly-Dead.

313
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,390
Of all the people to ally with against me…

314
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,980
you chose the Miwol-dong Baby Shaman?

315
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,030
Your life…

316
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:19,570
It's truly pitiful.

317
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,880
Have you been calling Gyeon-U
Newly-Dead all this while?

318
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:39,510
That's what you call
the ghost of a person who died recently.

319
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:42,930
Gyeon-U's alive and well,
so why call him Newly-Dead?

320
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,430
Just why?

321
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,030
It's a curse.

322
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,410
Pray and beg.

323
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,790
Are you crazy?

324
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,250
Not to me.

325
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:49,750
To your original patron deity.

326
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:52,880
Did you think I wouldn't realize

327
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,000
you were serving an evil spirit
and not your patron deity?

328
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,420
Even if you'd tried to cleanse the photos,
you would've failed.

329
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,970
I saw through you the moment
you called Gyeon-U Newly-Dead.

330
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:07,020
Just how much evil did you do?

331
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,640
Your spirit vessel is cracking.

332
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,410
So what?

333
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,620
You must beg your patron deity.

334
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:29,660
Ask them to return to you.

335
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,920
A shaman can't serve evil spirits.

336
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,710
Shut your mouth!

337
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,210
Or it might get ripped open.

338
00:30:58,650 --> 00:30:59,900
<i>What's the bottom line?</i>

339
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,440
The shaman hovering around Gyeon-U

340
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:04,320
is deadly scary
but feeble in shamanic powers?

341
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,280
His 21 days are up in just 2 days.

342
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:08,540
<i>Why now?</i>

343
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,370
Don't worry. I'm here.

344
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,920
Starting tomorrow,
hug him whenever there's a ghost nearby.

345
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,920
You see the ghosts,
and I must do the physical touch.

346
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,170
Yeah.

347
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:21,420
We'll have to show some class teamwork.

348
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,680
<i>-Is Gyeon-U okay?</i>
-He'll be okay.

349
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,140
I'm handling things outside.

350
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,980
And your robot friend
is guarding him inside.

351
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:34,940
That little punk. He's doing his part.

352
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,020
By the way,

353
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:41,030
why do I feel like something's off?

354
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:43,490
It feels like I forgot
something important.

355
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,360
<i>Like what? Think carefully.</i>

356
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:46,530
I'LL KILL YOU, PYO JI-HO

357
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,530
Whatever. I must've messed up again.

358
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:50,950
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

359
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,470
Two days.

360
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,180
We just need to get through two more days.

361
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,610
Once the 21 days are over,

362
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:22,610
you can stay away from shamans forever.

363
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,070
You'll be the same as everyone else…

364
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,330
and be at peace.

365
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,540
BAE GYEON-U! SAVE HIM! PROTECT HIM!

366
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:54,850
By burning the precious photos,

367
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,390
you saved your precious grandmother.

368
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,650
Ignore what she said. You're not weak.

369
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:02,690
You're strong enough.

370
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,240
Just hate me.

371
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,160
If I were you,

372
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:15,290
I'd hate shamans too.

373
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:19,790
I'm sorry.

374
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,130
<i>Telling someone to hate you…</i>

375
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,640
<i>hurts even if you don't mean it.</i>

376
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,410
You're the one who should hate me,

377
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:57,290
you dummy.

378
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,110
This is it?

379
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,860
You thought

380
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,660
this could stop me?

381
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:57,180
Just one more.

382
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:00,430
If you kill one more person,

383
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,020
you can ascend and become an evil deity.

384
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:09,280
Just one more.

385
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,440
If you kill

386
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:13,530
just one more person…

387
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,090
How's this?

388
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,470
Will this help

389
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,850
speed up the process?

390
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,100
Make haste and ascend.

391
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,520
Please come to me…

392
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,900
and be my patron deity.

393
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:06,140
Hey.

394
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:10,310
You disinfected your hand, right?

395
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,610
You can't let it get infected.

396
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,190
Goodness.

397
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:15,940
I can take care of myself.

398
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:28,870
Can I have a word?

399
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,000
You too.

400
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,420
Yes, you.

401
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,050
What about the presentation?

402
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,800
You two are the only ones
who have done nothing.

403
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,390
I'll do that now. I promise.

404
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,260
I'll get right to it.

405
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:44,260
Sorry.

406
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:45,430
For today

407
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:46,810
and for yesterday.

408
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,400
If I hadn't said anything,
you'd apologize again tomorrow.

409
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:57,150
I have a question. What about Seong-A?
She didn't do it either.

410
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:58,740
Yes, she did.

411
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,240
She did it really well too.

412
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,910
Thanks. I heard you did
my share of work on the assignment.

413
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,330
Your shouldn't waste your precious time
on such stupid stuff.

414
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:13,290
So which of these photos
have ghosts in them?

415
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,840
This one.

416
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,760
And this one.

417
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:30,100
I knew this was an actual ghost.

418
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:31,730
No.

419
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,100
Not that one.

420
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:36,360
Here. The ghost is standing right here.

421
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:39,900
Here?

422
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,840
You're a truly mysterious species.

423
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,050
It's so cool.

424
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,640
There's not much time. How frustrating.

425
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:10,850
You traitor.

426
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,360
Move. You're in the way.

427
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,570
-Help me.
-What?

428
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:24,910
I want to take ghost photos.

429
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:28,530
Ghost photos?

430
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:50,720
Here.

431
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,110
Here.

432
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:01,280
Any pictures I take have ghosts in them.

433
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,820
What kind of ghost is this
that it's stuck to the floor like this?

434
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:08,780
It's a dog.

435
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:12,620
A Dog Ghost.

436
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:34,850
What?

437
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,520
Good luck.

438
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,520
You know we're on different teams, right?

439
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,820
-I'm open.
-Over here!

440
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,650
-Come on. Here.
-Pass me the ball.

441
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,910
Hey, what on earth…

442
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,700
Now.

443
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:52,740
Now.

444
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,620
Sir!

445
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:57,790
He's breaking the rules. Sir!

446
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:59,040
Fairy.

447
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,880
-Oh, right. There's one.
-Hey!

448
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,010
-Here!
-And this one?

449
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:06,300
-Over here!
-There aren't any.

450
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,340
Nice pass!

451
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,970
One animal.

452
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,020
-Pass me the ball!
-Two. One human and one animal.

453
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,490
What's wrong with you?

454
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,490
Sorry. My bad.

455
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,300
<i>Sweet Bok-i. She's so cute.</i>

456
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:52,550
Hey, Fairy.

457
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:03,770
What's wrong?

458
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,290
<i>Faceless Ghosts?</i>

459
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:19,160
SO-CALLED "EGG GHOSTS"
GHOSTS WITH NO EYES, NOSE, AND LIPS

460
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:39,430
-Hey.
-Sir, he keeps playing foul.

461
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,940
-What are you doing?
-Class President.

462
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,440
I'm sick. I'm going home.

463
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:47,280
-What? That goes on your record.
-What's gotten into Park Seong-A?

464
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,780
What's up with her?

465
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:56,200
She didn't look unwell.

466
00:42:58,410 --> 00:42:59,700
<i>She didn't look well either.</i>

467
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,960
Take it. Seong-A has something to say.

468
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:06,380
Seong-A?

469
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:10,880
Hey, it's me.

470
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:13,300
<i>Hey, Ji-ho. Make contact whenever you can.</i>

471
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,930
<i>-Stay with him at all times.</i>
-What? Why?

472
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,100
Sure thing.

473
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:23,810
Don't worry and rest up. Bye.

474
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:29,780
I knew it. Does she badly need my help?

475
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:30,690
No.

476
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:32,780
It's not that. She's just…

477
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:35,030
You look relaxed.

478
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:36,780
Do you have time to kill?

479
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:39,910
She told me to work hard
for our presentation and not upset Hye-ri.

480
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:42,200
But she's in a foul mood 24-7.

481
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:44,040
Seong-A wasted her breath.

482
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:44,960
You be quiet.

483
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,590
Can you finish your parts by today?

484
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:48,880
By today?

485
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:51,460
I have archery practice this evening.

486
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:53,300
Oh, do you?

487
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,130
Then you have until tomorrow morning.

488
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:56,550
Pull an all-nighter.

489
00:43:57,970 --> 00:43:58,970
Pull an all-nighter?

490
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:02,180
-By ourselves?
-Yeah.

491
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,690
You're a genius, Hye-ri.

492
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:13,400
I promise to pull an all-nighter.

493
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,950
Let's stay up all night, friend.

494
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:20,080
What's wrong with you?

495
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:25,960
He's so sweaty. Gross.

496
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:28,670
Your face is red.

497
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:30,670
You look even uglier.

498
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,760
What was that?

499
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,280
Oh, my goodness. This is so…

500
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:00,660
There are Egg Ghosts everywhere.

501
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,080
It's so gross.

502
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,580
Egg Ghosts…

503
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:06,580
I mean, Faceless Ghosts
are usually harmless.

504
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:09,580
But not when there's
a whole group of them.

505
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:13,840
It means they're expecting a master
to come and give them new faces soon.

506
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,880
They'll be the first
to celebrate the birth of an evil deity.

507
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,850
And it's obvious
who that evil deity will be.

508
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:22,890
It must be the one sealed up in the shack.

509
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:25,930
Let's head there first.

510
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,060
Okay.

511
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:32,230
Jeez, I really don't want to go.

512
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:40,530
Yeomhwa.

513
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:43,990
You are well and truly out of your mind.

514
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:01,300
First,

515
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:03,260
let's do what we can right now.

516
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:15,250
How dare you act up, you weaklings?

517
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:16,960
You little…

518
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,550
I'll come for you!

519
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:19,880
Gosh, you're so scary.

520
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:22,680
What do we do now?

521
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:26,720
We should find that marionette's head.

522
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:30,980
If we don't undo the spell on it,
ghosts will keep coming.

523
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:33,020
The head spreads the word
that an evil deity is on the way.

524
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,770
She's right. We must find the head first.

525
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:37,900
All right. Let's find the head.

526
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:38,820
By the way,

527
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,780
Heaven and Earth Fairy
seems more knowledgeable

528
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:43,200
about this area than you, my dear general.

529
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,450
About the Ghoul-Making Amulet too.

530
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,700
I suppose you're feeling better

531
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:49,660
judging by how you're yapping again.

532
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:52,200
I'm just curious.
I'm bubbling with questions.

533
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:55,710
Like I said, I have questions.

534
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:56,960
Just go find the head.

535
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,460
Gyeon-U.

536
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:01,510
What?

537
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:03,880
My bow's weight is off.

538
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:05,680
Take a look for me.

539
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:07,300
Let me see.

540
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:09,930
Stand over here.

541
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:11,180
What feels off?

542
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:12,270
I can't say.

543
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,060
Is the center off-kilter?

544
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:15,140
A bit.

545
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:18,690
Doesn't it feel off?

546
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:21,730
Try drawing it.

547
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,410
-It feels okay.
-It's okay? Really?

548
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:32,910
There's no way it's fine, though.

549
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,580
-Was archery a touchy-feely sport?
-Are you sure it's not off?

550
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:37,290
-You're weird. What's wrong?
-No, it's the bow.

551
00:48:37,370 --> 00:48:38,210
-Well?
-Sir?

552
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:42,090
A motorcycle!

553
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:44,800
A bicycle!

554
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:46,220
Hey.

555
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:47,840
A cart!

556
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:49,180
Let go.

557
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,720
-Let go.
-Why are you so strong?

558
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:52,720
Watch out!

559
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,520
We live in a dangerous world.

560
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:03,730
Don't we, Gyeon-U?

561
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:06,820
Seriously…

562
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:10,370
Gyeon-U!

563
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:13,540
-Sir. Let me help you.
-Me too.

564
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:15,790
-One, two.
-One, two.

565
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:26,840
-Hey.
-What? Why?

566
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,550
Forget it.

567
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,270
About Seong-A.

568
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:40,900
What? Seong-A?

569
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:42,020
What about her?

570
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:43,480
Why ask about her all of a sudden?

571
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:49,410
It's nothing.

572
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:10,380
Is this it?

573
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:12,760
My gosh! This is it!

574
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:14,600
It's disgusting! Yikes.

575
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,720
Bring it over so we can burn it.

576
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,290
Burning won't do any good.

577
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:38,790
A rumor should be countered
with another rumor.

578
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:40,710
The fastest way to get the ghosts to flee

579
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:42,620
is to make them think
the evil spirit won't ascend.

580
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:45,170
I get it, but doesn't that hurt?

581
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,960
You sliced your hand as if it's nothing.

582
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:48,130
It hurts more if you hesitate.

583
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:50,220
I've done this when I was a kid.

584
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,480
Good guy. Hang in there a little longer.

585
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,390
Come back to life,

586
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:38,890
Gyeon-U Gyeon-U.

587
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,890
Get out.

588
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:45,810
Get out!

589
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:48,070
Okay, I'm getting out.

590
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,490
Good night.

591
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,620
<i>I have a question.</i>

592
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:06,750
Ask away.

593
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:11,550
Do you know the shaman you danced with?

594
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:14,090
Are you two close?

595
00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:18,800
She's Miwol-dong Baby Shaman.

596
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:23,350
But that was the first time
I met her in person.

597
00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:26,440
She should live a good long life too.

598
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:29,900
When she dies, she'll go to hell like me.

599
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:44,290
MIWOL-DONG BABY SHAMAN

600
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,630
<i>An eight-year-old baby shaman.</i>

601
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:51,960
<i>Seong-A starts her day</i>

602
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:55,090
<i>a little earlier</i>
<i>than other children her age.</i>

603
00:52:56,470 --> 00:53:00,550
DOCUSERIES THREE DAYS

604
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:06,940
Roses are in bloom.

605
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:08,940
Right here.

606
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:12,730
That's right.
My daughter got a rose tattoo there.

607
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,150
She's with child.

608
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:15,360
What?

609
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:17,320
But she's only 20 years old.

610
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:19,700
As for who the father is,

611
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,410
she will never tell.

612
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:25,830
Are you pregnant?

613
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:28,330
<i>How do you know that, Mom?</i>

614
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:37,840
<i>Have you heard of Miwol-dong Baby Shaman?</i>

615
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:41,600
She was in a documentary ten years ago.
She was pretty famous.

616
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,010
<i>That's me.</i>

617
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:48,060
You won't make much with such small fries.

618
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:51,100
You can't even make
a proper Ghoul-Making Amulet?

619
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:10,500
Don't cry.

620
00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:13,090
You shouldn't cry.

621
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,710
This is what makes Mom and Dad happy.

622
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,930
<i>I won't see any ghosts.</i>

623
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:29,430
<i>I'll be a good girl.</i>

624
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,730
<i>Don't leave me.</i>

625
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:36,020
<i>Please don't leave me.</i>

626
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:42,610
Kiddo.

627
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:45,530
You're tempting the heaven's punishment.

628
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,080
<i>Why would you bring that up?</i>

629
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:56,880
I can share it nonchalantly
because it's not a big deal.

630
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:03,390
I first started school
as a middle schooler.

631
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,480
<i>Those who suffered</i>
<i>because of Miwol-dong Baby Shaman.</i>

632
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:17,150
Justice lives, and it prevails.

633
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:19,320
-Do it quick.
-Did you think it was over?

634
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:24,610
WE HATE YOU,
MIWOL-DONG BABY SHAMAN PARK SEONG-A

635
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:29,450
I never imagined this, honestly.

636
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:30,750
TEACHING MIWOL-DONG BABY SHAMAN
A LESSON

637
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,380
<i>I got what I deserved, I guess.</i>

638
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:40,630
The end.

639
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:42,420
It's done.

640
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:58,230
Stop acting tough and get over here.

641
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:09,450
What are you both doing?

642
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:11,870
When kids don't cry
when they're supposed to,

643
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:14,210
it breaks us adults' hearts.

644
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,170
My heart's broken right now.

645
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:20,000
Don't be dramatic.

646
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:36,690
This is nice.

647
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,290
Hey.

648
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,670
When did you and Seong-A get close?

649
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:58,880
We're not close.

650
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:13,470
Last year, when we were in 10th grade.

651
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:17,600
Then you don't know
what she did before then?

652
00:57:17,690 --> 00:57:19,060
You were there when she explained.

653
00:57:19,150 --> 00:57:20,900
She didn't attend elementary
and middle school.

654
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:26,610
Exactly how horrible have I been to her?

655
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,240
Do you both think I'm stupid?

656
00:57:32,330 --> 00:57:34,200
I've met so many shamans.

657
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:37,910
You touch me because Seong-A told you to.

658
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:40,540
It's what she used to do.

659
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:45,340
You're right. You heard me say,
"Come back to life, Gyeon-U Gyeon-U."

660
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,590
You'd be an idiot not to catch on.

661
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:52,050
Do you believe it now
that Seong-A's trying to protect you?

662
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:54,930
Yeah.

663
00:57:58,560 --> 00:57:59,560
Gyeon-U.

664
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:03,940
Just you wait until tomorrow's over.

665
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:05,900
You ungrateful little punk.

666
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:08,400
What's so special about tomorrow?

667
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:12,990
You just need to know
that you've been a huge jerk.

668
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:16,410
See you tomorrow, Gyeon-U Gyeon-U.

669
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:36,970
You don't get to call yourself a father!

670
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:38,640
How dare you, you brat!

671
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:41,230
You piece of shit.

672
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,520
You punk.

673
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:48,990
<i>Jin-ung?</i>

674
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,610
You're out of your mind, punk.

675
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:52,820
Bok-i.

676
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:53,950
You idiot.

677
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,200
Bite him.

678
00:58:56,990 --> 00:58:58,830
-You can do it, Bok-i. Bite him.
-You little…

679
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:01,080
Bite the man hard.

680
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:02,790
Do it!

681
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:07,800
What was that?

682
00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:09,970
-Hey.
-Well done.

683
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:15,050
Seong-A.

684
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,430
I didn't do anything, Gyeon-U.

685
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:22,480
I really didn't.

686
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:24,440
What? I was just…

687
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,860
Let's continue with the group work today.

688
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:38,080
My gosh. You're awake for once, Seong-A.

689
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,370
Jin-ung's not here?

690
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:43,540
-No.
-No.

691
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:46,630
Right, it's about time he went back
to his old ways, isn't it?

692
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:48,340
Let's get your desks into formation.

693
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:53,380
So change your phone number and move.

694
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:58,600
Mom. Don't call anyone, okay?

695
00:59:58,680 --> 00:59:59,930
Especially not me. Okay?

696
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:04,520
The bastard got out of prison!

697
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:07,520
If he finds you this time…

698
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:11,230
you'll die.

699
01:00:16,110 --> 01:00:17,870
I said I knew you well, didn't I?

700
01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:21,410
Hey, you!

701
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:24,460
I won't beat you up. Stop right there!

702
01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:55,860
Kim Jin-ung!

703
01:00:57,410 --> 01:00:58,370
Hey!

704
01:01:04,830 --> 01:01:06,620
Are you here, son?

705
01:01:09,630 --> 01:01:11,630
If I catch you, you're dead meat!

706
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:12,920
Hey, son!

707
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:16,010
Come out and talk to me.

708
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:41,070
Kim Jin-ung!

709
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:02,470
What's this?

710
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:03,970
A ring?

711
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:19,700
Let me summarize it one last time.

712
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:23,070
We're covering
Kant's anthropocentric philosophy.

713
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:24,660
What's the main idea again?

714
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:27,910
It's all about putting people first.

715
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,080
Humans are to be at the center,
not machines.

716
01:02:30,170 --> 01:02:32,670
It's not about money but about people.

717
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:34,250
People are precious beings,

718
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:36,710
so they shouldn't be treated
as a means to an end.

719
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,970
-Why?
-What?

720
01:02:39,050 --> 01:02:40,720
What do you mean, "why?"

721
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:46,060
What aren't you getting
about not treating humans as a means?

722
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:47,020
Sir.

723
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:48,890
I'll go and get Jin-ung.

724
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,020
-Where…
-Hey.

725
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:00,610
Is Jin-ung in here?

726
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:03,110
Please help!

727
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:06,830
-I can't go inside.
-Help!

728
01:03:06,910 --> 01:03:08,870
Bok-i, I can't go in here.

729
01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:11,410
Help me!

730
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:15,670
Damn it.

731
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:16,790
Help!

732
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,380
I really shouldn't do this.

733
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:40,860
Lady Fairy went into the abandoned house.

734
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:44,610
Help…

735
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:50,910
Jin-ung, breathe.

736
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Jin-ung!

737
01:03:54,370 --> 01:03:56,670
Release him already!

738
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:58,210
Stop it!

739
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:33,200
Hello, Shaman.

740
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:43,760
Shouldn't you say hello back?

741
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:23,420
SPECIAL THANKS TO GWAG JA-HYEONG

742
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,130
<i>You should have let me die then and there.</i>

743
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:28,930
Gyeon-U!

744
01:05:29,010 --> 01:05:31,140
<i>A person shouldn't do this</i>
<i>to another person.</i>

745
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:35,270
I chose the last offering for you myself.

746
01:05:35,350 --> 01:05:37,890
<i>Shall I tell you</i>
<i>why your life is a living hell?</i>

747
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:39,190
Come with me, you nutcase.

748
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:41,310
<i>Why is it Gyeon-U again?</i>

749
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,320
<i>Because he's easy prey.</i>

750
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,230
How much evil did you commit
that everything's so dark?

751
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:47,360
I'll just kill you all!

752
01:05:47,450 --> 01:05:48,990
<i>Was I human?</i>

753
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:53,160
<i>I found you.</i>

754
01:05:55,450 --> 01:05:58,460
