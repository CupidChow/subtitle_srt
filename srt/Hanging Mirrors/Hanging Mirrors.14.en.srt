=Episode 14=

3
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,150
What's your relationship with him?

4
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,100
We're dating, of course.

5
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,340
The videos were just for fun.

6
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,700
We never shared them.

7
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,060
Is this

8
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:17,940
illegal?

9
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,380
How much does Zhao Zhengru pay you?

10
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,020
Can you find any

11
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,500
payment records from him to me?

12
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,620
Sorry.

13
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,780
There aren't any.

14
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,540
Because we're in a relationship.

15
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,500
He buys me dinner,

16
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,460
beauty treatments

17
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,300
and gym sessions.

18
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,380
He buys me gifts.

19
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,540
It's all mutual and consensual.

20
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,380
Did you know he died?

21
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,220
He was murdered.

22
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,100
If you don't want trouble,

23
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,820
you'd better cooperate with us.

24
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,220
Died?

25
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,020
Think clearly.

26
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,100
A tragic death.

27
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,700
Want to see the photos?

28
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,220
No, no need.

29
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,260
Now, say something.

30
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,120
Alright.

31
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,780
I'll talk.

32
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,220
We've known each other for over a year.

33
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,180
He is

34
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,060
very generous and kind.

35
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,940
But honestly,

36
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,820
nothing ever happened between us.

37
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,420
Because

38
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:38,820
he

39
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,340
couldn't function.

40
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,060
He came to me

41
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,620
to get my help.

42
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,460
But nothing seemed to work.

43
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,700
At first,

44
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,820
I kind of mocked him,

45
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,900
but later I felt sorry for him.

46
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,780
The big shot out there

47
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,220
became a pathetic nobody

48
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,620
in the bedroom.

49
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,660
I felt like I was doing a good deed,

50
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,580
helping someone who's

51
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,220
wealthy and powerful,

52
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,740
yet not truly happy.

53
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,620
When was the last time

54
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,700
you two met?

55
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,580
The last time…

56
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,580
It was the 25th

57
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,140
of last month.

58
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,420
Did he tell you

59
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,340
when this started?

60
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,220
What else do you know?

61
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,180
Ms. Chen.

62
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,060
Ms. Chen.

63
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,860
I've been brushing for five days.

64
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,500
My eyes feel a bit weird.

65
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,620
Look.

66
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,420
Better now.

67
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,420
Stop it.

68
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,340
How's your girlfriend?

69
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,380
We broke up.

70
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,620
Didn't expect that.

71
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,780
Weren't you getting married?

72
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,700
I'm only thirty, why rush?

73
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,580
Still young.

74
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,900
Excuses, excuses.

75
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,500
What do you think of He Xiang?

76
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,730
He Xiang?

77
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,620
Forget it.

78
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,100
He Xiang's out of your league.

79
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,940
I was quite handsome when I was young.

80
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,340
Aren't you still young?

81
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,740
I'm just a bit chubby now.

82
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:47,940
Senior.

83
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,340
Mr. Pang is here.

84
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,060
How can I help?

85
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,740
It's about our project.

86
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,860
Our company developed a housing project.

87
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,620
Phase one was completed last year.

88
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,180
While working on phase two,

89
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,340
we found a small ancient tomb.

90
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,380
So…

91
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,340
Wasn't it fully handled?

92
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,660
Yes, we backfilled it per your request.

93
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,660
Now, we just need your signature

94
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,420
to proceed with the work.

95
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,420
I have the paper with me.

96
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,380
Alright.

97
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,620
I need to check it.

98
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,500
Sure.

99
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,060
(Former partner Zhengru Real Estate
exited the project)

100
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,260
You partnered

101
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,620
with Zhengru Real Estate?

102
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,420
Yes, we've always worked with him.

103
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,100
Are you familiar with Zhao Zhengru?

104
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,300
Well,

105
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,220
Zhao Zhengru and I were classmates.

106
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,340
So you must know a lot about him.

107
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,660
Of course I do.

108
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,660
You know what?

109
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,910
Zhao came from a small town,

110
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,500
but he's very ambitious.

111
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,260
In college,

112
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,140
he was a great student

113
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,640
and on the basketball team,

114
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,460
really outstanding.

115
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,860
Just one thing.

116
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,460
He was a total player.

117
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,620
During college,

118
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,580
he had many romantic troubles.

119
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,100
In his senior year,

120
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,880
he slept with a girl he shouldn't have.

121
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:21,940
One time,

122
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,620
when he dated that girl,

123
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,660
her boyfriend showed up

124
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,700
and caught them red-handed.

125
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,860
After that, that guy

126
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,260
gave him a serious beating.

127
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:03,980
One day,

128
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,460
the girl's boyfriend said

129
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,460
he was going on a trip.

130
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,700
So, she called up Zhao again.

131
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,700
Word is,

132
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,860
Zhao had no idea she had a boyfriend

133
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:13,980
and went to meet her.

134
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,180
But her boyfriend showed up

135
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,100
with prepared ice blocks

136
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,460
and hurled them right at Zhao.

137
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,660
He hit him hard.

138
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,940
Zhao was too ashamed

139
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,980
to call the police

140
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,940
and had to take the hit.

141
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,500
Since then,

142
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,140
he's been a true stoic.

143
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,180
No more fooling around.

144
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,580
Later I heard,

145
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,580
he liked a musician.

146
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,500
Well, let's not talk about him.

147
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,180
Anyway,

148
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,740
please sign here.

149
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,260
I need to review this document.

150
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,780
Once signed,

151
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,940
I'll have it sent to you.

152
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,580
Alright.

153
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,460
Senior,

154
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,500
it's just a signature.

155
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,700
We need to be cautious.

156
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,780
Right?

157
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,700
Yes.

158
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,100
That's right.

159
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,980
If there's nothing else,

160
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,500
you can head back.

161
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,220
- Okay.
- Alright.

162
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,180
Alright. I'll head out.

163
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,460
I'll leave you be.

164
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,660
He Xiang.

165
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,500
Who is he to you?

166
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,940
Just

167
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,980
a friend.

168
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,300
Well, businessman.

169
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,460
What's a businessman?

170
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,100
No funny business.

171
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,860
Xu Xiao,

172
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,700
I have some news about Zhao Zhengru

173
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,020
that I'd like to share with you.

174
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,460
It means

175
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,340
Zhao Zhengru

176
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,940
had sexual dysfunction.

177
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,100
Wasn't it karma for a player?

178
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,460
Over 20 years of no cure.

179
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,060
He finally ran out of patience.

180
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,580
Then a friend told him

181
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,060
about a mysterious method

182
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,460
from an ancient tomb.

183
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,020
So he took the risky moves.

184
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,220
Mr. Zhao.

185
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,500
So Zhao got on board,

186
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,380
committing murder,

187
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,260
sacrifice,

188
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,500
dismemberment,

189
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,180
and dark rituals.

190
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,500
But the crimes were exposed,

191
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,140
so he silenced

192
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,660
partners and witnesses.

193
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,180
He even hired hitmen abroad,

194
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,620
but didn't foresee

195
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,480
being betrayed by his partner.

196
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,700
Now, we must catch Wang Bingde.

197
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,260
We're investigating Zhao

198
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,820
to find their link.

199
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,140
As for his

200
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,060
scandals…

201
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,740
Thanks anyway.

202
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,300
No problem. I'm your advisor.

203
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,380
Did you say

204
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,020
Zhao liked a musician?

205
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,660
Yeah.

206
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,780
That's what Mr. Pang said.

207
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,980
He said there's nothing going on

208
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,100
between him and the musician.

209
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:30,980
Here.

210
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,140
Interpret this for me.

211
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,980
It was found at Zhao's house,

212
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,300
but it should belong to Zhou Daye.

213
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,900
This should be

214
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,020
the record of the method for immortality.

215
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:48,900
Really?

216
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,020
There must be the other piece.

217
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,740
Two pieces?

218
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,660
People in ancient times

219
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,340
had one approach

220
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,980
in both mental and physical techniques,

221
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,900
just like martial arts.

222
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,060
This tortoise shell here

223
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,700
records the mental techniques,

224
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,580
which are conceptual.

225
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,300
I think

226
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,980
there must be the other piece.

227
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,500
It records

228
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,780
the physical techniques,

229
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,050
which are more crucial.

230
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,540
That Monarch was buried

231
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,980
with his arms crossed over his chest.

232
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,620
Was it meant for him

233
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,860
to hold one piece in each hand?

234
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,820
That's

235
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,100
probably it.

236
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,620
Wasn't the other

237
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,380
in his hand?

238
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,340
When we found the tomb,

239
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,100
his one hand was crushed.

240
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,420
However, we found

241
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,140
no shell pieces at the site.

242
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,940
I guess it was Wang Bingde

243
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,100
who took the other piece.

244
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,100
Search over there.

245
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:08,980
Okay.

246
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,180
Further, over that way.

247
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,060
Got it.

248
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,180
Anything over there?

249
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,500
No.

250
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,180
Look around that way.

251
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,060
Alright.

252
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,740
How's it going?

253
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,620
No discoveries.

254
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,780
Anyone find anything?

255
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,020
We searched all over.

256
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:33,900
Nothing.

257
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,980
Nothing over there.

258
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,740
No, didn't find it.

259
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,980
Nothing here either.

260
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,300
Nothing found.

261
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,380
Found no clues.

262
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,340
Dafei.

263
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,220
Captain,

264
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,460
we searched everywhere.

265
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,980
It's a wide-open place.

266
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,220
No cameras or witnesses.

267
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,690
We couldn't find anything.

268
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,300
Come back for now.

269
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,460
Alright. Got it.

270
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,650
Still no sign of Wang Bingde?

271
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,300
Looks like we need to find

272
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,500
the musician Zhao was

273
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,620
attracted to.

274
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,820
Okay.

275
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,460
So many instruments.

276
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,220
Fan Xiaomeng, right?

277
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,500
Major Crimes Unit.

278
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,190
Got a few questions.

279
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,660
Do you know Zhao Zhengru?

280
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,860
Yes, I do.

281
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,190
Here's a photo.

282
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,380
Do you know this man?

283
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,140
I remember him.

284
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,220
About two years ago,

285
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,420
he invited Zhao and me

286
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,700
to a relics exhibition.

287
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,220
But it wasn't official.

288
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,580
Smells like dirt.

289
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,900
Must be fresh.

290
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,540
I'll show you.

291
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,420
Hi, Wang.

292
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,860
Mr. Zhao.

293
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,860
How's it going?

294
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,740
Glad you're here.

295
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,180
Please show us around.

296
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,060
Good stuff.

297
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,500
Here.

298
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,100
A dragon jade pendant.

299
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:21,980
Warring States Period.

300
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,860
Nice craftsmanship.

301
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,820
The jade's top-quality.

302
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:26,900
It's perfect for you.

303
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:28,940
Mr. Zhao.

304
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,140
Would you buy one for your lady?

305
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,620
This is really beautiful.

306
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,220
Do you like it?

307
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:37,820
Wang,

308
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:38,740
we're here to see

309
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,900
if there are any paintings.

310
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,620
You'll have to wait.

311
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,100
We only have bamboo slips

312
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,980
and silk manuscripts.

313
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,180
No worries. Go ahead.

314
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,340
We'll take a look around.

315
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,700
He used to deal in cultural relics.

316
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,620
Then he went legit.

317
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,350
Now he works in infrastructure for me.

318
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,940
Still trading on the side.

319
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,300
Are these

320
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,620
newly unearthed?

321
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:06,980
They are.

322
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,140
Isn't this illegal?

323
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:09,860
Relax, darling.

324
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,620
This event is private.

325
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,100
No one will leak it.

326
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,740
Zhengru.

327
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,100
I think you should

328
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,340
avoid these people.

329
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,580
It's not safe.

330
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,860
Don't worry.

331
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,780
I'll listen to you.

332
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,740
Look, isn't it beautiful?

333
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,820
So stunning.

334
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,100
It's translucent.

335
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,540
And then?

336
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,100
Afterward,

337
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,900
we didn't interact much.

338
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,620
Apparently, he didn't listen to me.

339
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,580
Did this man hurt him?

340
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,380
We're still investigating.

341
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,340
What's your relationship?

342
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,620
We're not really anything.

343
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,140
At most,

344
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:01,980
we were

345
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,420
just good friends.

346
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,340
That's it.

347
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,140
Zhengru was a gentleman

348
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,620
and he behaved like one.

349
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,860
What we had

350
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,900
was totally platonic.

351
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,580
He's never confessed to me

352
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,660
or forced me into anything.

353
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,860
I might just enjoy

354
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,940
the feeling of us being together,

355
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,700
like childhood friends

356
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,340
or innocent playmates.

357
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,620
It's comfortable being together.

358
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,340
Fan Xiaomeng,

359
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,140
think carefully.

360
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,380
Any other connection

361
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,700
between Zhao and Wang?

362
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,500
We need to find this man quickly.

363
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,900
After the relics exhibition,

364
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,460
we had a meal

365
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,340
with him.

366
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,500
And?

367
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,220
Nothing more.

368
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,100
However,

369
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,380
the chicken was delicious.

370
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,420
I remember that well.

371
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,660
So Zhengru and I

372
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,300
went there again.

373
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,860
But it wasn't as good the second time.

374
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,900
We found out later

375
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,660
the restaurant is run by Wang's student.

376
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,900
Only when he visits
is the real stuff served.

377
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,740
What's the name of that place?

378
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,060
I think it's Cui Haitao.

379
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,940
Yes.

380
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,140
Cui Haitao.

381
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,220
That's the name.

382
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,140
Seems to be the owner's name.

383
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,540
This one?

384
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,740
Seems like it's this place.

385
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,940
(Cui Haitao's Agritainment)

386
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:41,820
Look.

387
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:42,980
Jian Hexagram.

388
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,380
Favorable southwest,

389
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,260
meeting the great man.

390
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,940
Like I said,

391
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,380
Wang believes in hexagrams.

392
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:04,060
(Cui Haitao's Agritainment)

393
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,020
Cui Haitao, 42 years old,

394
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,940
served time for tomb robbery.

395
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,740
After release, he started this business.

396
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,620
Hello. For how many?

397
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,060
- Two.
- This way, please.

398
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:45,900
Follow me.

399
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,900
- Hi there.
- Hello.

400
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,940
Excuse me,

401
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,060
have you seen this man?

402
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,660
He's my friend.

403
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,180
We agreed to meet here,

404
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,900
and I've been here all morning.

405
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,860
Haven't seen him today.

406
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,220
Saw him last night though.

407
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,620
Alright, thanks.

408
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,500
No problem.

409
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,860
This one.

410
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,820
And this one.

411
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,700
Sure.

412
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,700
This one.

413
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,220
And this.

414
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,780
Captain.

415
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,620
I confirmed with the front desk.

416
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,700
Wang Bingde stayed here last night.

417
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,860
But no one has seen him today.

418
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,420
He might still be in his room.

419
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,020
Dafei,

420
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,700
try to get Cui Haitao out.

421
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,820
Somewhere quiet.

422
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,220
Alright.

423
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,140
Mr. Cui, they ordered a lot.

424
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,260
Let me take a look.

425
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,300
The menu.

426
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,780
I'll go check it out.

427
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,740
Excuse me.

428
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,980
You've ordered quite a bit.

429
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,940
We serve food in big portions.

430
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,580
How about this?

431
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,140
One, two, three.

432
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,700
Start with these three.

433
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,660
Order more if needed.

434
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,540
How does that sound?

435
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,660
What kind of boss

436
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,700
turns down easy money?

437
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,900
Avoid wasting, right?

438
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,060
Sure.

439
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,940
Just these three, then.

440
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:11,860
Got it.

441
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,740
A moment, please.

442
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,780
Sir.

443
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,980
Could you tell me where the restroom is?

444
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,580
Outside. Turn right.

445
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,220
- Thanks.
- No problem.

446
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,140
Captain Xu, no sign of Wang Bingde here.

447
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,550
Xiaoxing went to check.

448
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:23,980
For how many, sir?

449
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,140
Looking for someone.

450
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,580
Stay here and watch.

451
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,180
Take off the glasses.

452
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,260
Can you see clearly?

453
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,940
Don't say you don't know him.

454
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,140
I know him.

455
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,500
A regular.

456
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:25,720
His last name is Wang.

457
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,140
- Mr. Cui.
- Hello.

458
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,060
He came

459
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,540
two days ago.

460
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,980
Stayed in Room Two.

461
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,700
Much better.

462
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,980
Feeling a bit stressed.

463
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,260
So I'm here to clear my head.

464
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,900
Well,

465
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,780
could you

466
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,460
prepare a room for me?

467
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,020
I'll stay a couple nights.

468
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,540
He left last night.

469
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,460
He left?

470
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,380
He came alone?

471
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,380
- Yes.
- What else?

472
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,700
If my wife calls,

473
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,670
just say you don't know.

474
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,780
Alright.

475
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,460
Don't tell anyone.

476
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,580
Okay.

477
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,700
His wife is over 20 years younger.

478
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:31,980
Spoiled.

479
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,460
But, as guys,

480
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,660
I totally understand.

481
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,220
If I were him,

482
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,020
I wouldn't have married her.

483
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:38,910
Did he mention

484
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:39,940
where he was going?

485
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,740
He didn't.

486
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:42,900
Probably went home.

487
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,000
How long have you known him?

488
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,220
How did you meet?

489
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,900
It's been two years.

490
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,140
We met over dinner.

491
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,060
Be honest with us.

492
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,380
If you waste time,

493
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,620
forget about your business.

494
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,740
Phone.

495
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,300
It's my wife.

496
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,090
Say you're at the village committee.

497
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,260
Put it on speaker.

498
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,140
Got it.

499
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,100
Where are you?

500
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,030
Where the hell are you?

501
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,780
I'm at the village committee.

502
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,460
I'll be right back.

503
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:13,900
Hurry up.

504
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,620
We've lost two rounds of guests.

505
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,140
Alright, got it.

506
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,380
Good-for-nothing.

507
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,110
Business is overwhelming.

508
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,060
Take him back.

509
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,420
No, please don't.

510
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,660
Wait, wait.

511
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,180
I have nothing to do with Wang.

512
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,260
Cui Haitao.

513
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,660
We've been watching you.

514
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,380
If you don't cooperate,

515
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,660
we'll treat you that way.

516
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,660
Think carefully. This is your last chance.

517
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,900
Your last chance. Think and speak up.

518
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,140
This way.

519
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,500
Where have you been?

520
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,380
What took you so long?

521
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,380
I'm swamped here.

522
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,810
They're here to check out the rooms?

523
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,860
Yes, they're all guests.

524
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,060
Give me the key to Room Two.

525
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,380
Please come in.

526
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,400
Take good care of them.

527
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,700
It's just ahead.

528
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,500
Almost there.

529
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,740
(Visionary Leadership)

530
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,700
Officers,

531
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,140
did you find anything?

532
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,860
Where is he? Where is he?

533
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,320
- Lin. Lin.
- Say it.

534
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,300
Lin, stop it.

535
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,740
- Lin.
- Who is he?

536
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,940
- Stop it.
- Speak up.

537
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,540
- Come on, Lin.
- Tell us.

538
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,620
- Lin.
- Say it.

539
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,040
Lin? Lin?

540
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,700
(Ambulance)

541
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,620
Get him to the ICU.

542
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,300
Doctor.

543
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,300
Doctor.

544
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,180
Come on.

545
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,420
Hurry up.

546
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,300
We're all set.

547
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:20,090
Please wait here.

548
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,260
We're starting emergency care.

549
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,980
Find where Wang Bingde went.

550
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:34,980
Before midnight tonight,

551
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,650
I need his whereabouts.

552
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,620
Got it.

553
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,980
Lin, you're hiding something.

554
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,820
Hello?

555
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,700
Mr. Shi.

556
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,100
I need to know everything
about Lin Guoqiang.

557
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,100
You have to tell me.

558
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,180
Lin's in the hospital now.

559
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,820
Not looking good.

560
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,740
Ten years ago,

561
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:34,460
Lin solved a dismemberment case.

562
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,020
The murderer

563
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,180
was a relics dealer.

564
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,660
Was it Zhou Jiahei?

565
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,380
Yes.

566
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,740
Zhou Jiahei was cunning.

567
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,260
He tried to bribe Lin first,

568
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,950
but after being rejected,

569
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,900
he kidnapped his daughter.

570
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,700
Hello?

571
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,020
Officer Lin,

572
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,420
I've sent you a message.

573
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,100
Check it out.

574
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,180
Drive.

575
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,740
Zhou Jiahei

576
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,820
was desperate.

577
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,740
He actually tried

578
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,820
to threaten Lin

579
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,380
with his daughter's life.

580
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,100
But Lin

581
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,460
would never agree to that.

582
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,780
He warned Zhou Jiahei

583
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,100
not to make more mistakes.

584
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,820
Then,

585
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,670
he rushed to the scene to rescue her.

586
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,420
Team A, over there.

587
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,300
Team B, follow me.

588
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,180
Go.

589
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:16,980
Greatness.

590
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,380
Greatness comes at a cost.

591
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,900
Zhou Jiahei was too ruthless.

592
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,980
He knew he couldn't escape.

593
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,900
So he decided to end it all.

594
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:52,540
Before doing so,

595
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,540
he killed Lin's daughter.

596
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,140
Moreover,

597
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,620
he left

598
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,380
unique marks

599
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,460
on the girl's eyelids.

600
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,580
She was only 18.

601
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,180
I heard she excelled in school.

602
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,660
She was beautiful,

603
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,500
talented, and skilled.

604
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,460
She passed away

605
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,060
in the prime of life.

606
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,100
Why didn't anyone

607
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,300
tell me this before?

608
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,460
Heroes shed blood and tears.

609
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,360
This incident

610
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,460
shocked the whole system.

611
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:44,900
Lin Guoqiang was devastated.

612
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,460
He got divorced

613
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,940
and was transferred
to the Cultural Relics Unit,

614
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,980
then to the archives,

615
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,500
doing an idle job.

616
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,660
For both him

617
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:56,740
and us,

618
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,500
it's a scar no one wishes to touch.

619
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,260
Only time can fade the pain.

620
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,100
In your bureau,

621
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,300
nobody knew.

622
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:09,100
The unassuming old man

623
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:10,820
was a big hero

624
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:13,020
back in the day.

625
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,860
Was Zhou Jiahei really dead?

626
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,420
Of course.

627
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,740
The case was closed.

628
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,140
But some escaped justice back then.

629
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,540
That's why Lin

630
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,620
insisted on joining the case team.

631
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,180
Behind every victim,

632
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,980
there's a broken family.

633
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,460
A grieving mother,

634
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,940
and a heartbroken father.

635
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,460
You've never been a dad,

636
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,340
so you don't know how it feels.

637
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,180
Raising a daughter is different
from raising a son.

638
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:47,780
Daughters are gentler.

639
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,140
The way they look at you

640
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,120
is something other women don't have.

641
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,820
They only see the good in you.
