3
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,040
Stop.

4
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,410
Sir, I need to borrow your bike.

5
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,250
Let's split up.

6
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,010
Go on.

7
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,130
Stop chasing.

8
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,570
Stop it.

9
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,890
No more running?

10
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:58,880
Why are you chasing me?

11
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,040
Who are you?

12
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,360
You tell me.

13
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,250
Okay. I confess.

14
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,670
I only dumped it once.

15
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:09,730
They told me to do it.

16
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,080
They told you to do it?

17
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,800
- Yes.
- Who do you mean by "they"?

18
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,740
Genwa

19
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,610
and Wu Qiang.

20
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:17,720
So you only dumped it once?

21
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:21,570
Three times.

22
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,800
After that,

23
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,360
I got panicked.

24
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,200
So I looked it up online.

25
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,360
Only then did I realize

26
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,890
- it's illegal.
- You had to look that up?

27
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,290
It was all my fault.

28
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,410
I told the two of them

29
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,010
to spend some money

30
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:35,890
to settle it.

31
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,200
But they insisted I dump it.

32
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,630
Do you realize you committed a crime?

33
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,640
I do.

34
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,170
I was so broke

35
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,610
that I did something so wrong.

36
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,080
If I had money,

37
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,320
Officer,

38
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,920
I'd never have done such a thing.

39
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,130
What's your name?

40
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,800
My name is Wang Qing.

41
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,520
Got something here.

42
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,120
How much did they pay you?

43
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:06,250
Ten yuan.

44
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,290
What exactly did you dump?

45
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,050
Wait.

46
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,120
Didn't you find it?

47
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,050
Speak.

48
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,320
Twelve piglets

49
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,370
died from illness.

50
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,410
What?

51
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,920
Little pigs.

52
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,970
A total of twelve.

53
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:28,130
I dumped them

54
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,610
in three batches.

55
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,050
Three batches?

56
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:40,610
Hello?

57
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,210
Captain Xu, we found

58
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,050
some dead piglets.

59
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,680
Do you want to take a look?

60
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,770
No need.

61
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,530
Call epidemic control to handle it.

62
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,680
Wrap up and leave.

63
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,520
Go get some rest.

64
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:51,610
Alright.

65
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,320
What are you doing?

66
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,140
Cops can't hit people.

67
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,090
Take him.

68
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,190
To the local police station.

69
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,280
Move.

70
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,520
Why didn't you run?

71
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,960
I can't.

72
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,280
My leg cramped up.

73
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,480
The marks on the eyelids

74
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,210
were made before death.

75
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,890
(Shuoyang Public Security Bureau)
Other wounds are postmortem.

76
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,920
What does that mean?

77
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:40,490
It's a marker.

78
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,010
But why this mark?

79
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,090
What's the purpose?

80
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:46,890
Hey, Lin.

81
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,000
They said you're back.

82
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,370
I came to check on you.

83
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,650
Come in. Let's talk inside.

84
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,880
Still no luck on the left side?

85
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,210
Mr. Lin,

86
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,800
everything you've mentioned

87
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,320
is just your perspective.

88
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,360
We have our own way of handling cases.

89
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,210
If you find that missing half,

90
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,050
I'll step aside.

91
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,040
But if you can't find it,

92
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,360
can you hear me out?

93
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,760
Go ahead.

94
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,320
I'm sorry.

95
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,840
The suggestion I made

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,320
was inconsiderate.

97
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,520
But I believe,

98
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:19,890
this case

99
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,360
is not simple at all.

100
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,360
Yes, we are aware of that.

101
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,240
It's a devil in human disguise.

102
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:31,730
What do you mean?

103
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:32,610
You think

104
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,360
they were dumping bodies.

105
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,090
But have you ever thought

106
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,980
about what they're trying to suppress

107
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,610
by dumping the bodies?

108
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,320
No, Mr. Lin.

109
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,480
Please don't bring up

110
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,920
that superstitious stuff, okay?

111
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,920
You may not believe it.

112
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,920
Same for you

113
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,760
and me.

114
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,210
But the suspect believes it.

115
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,770
What are you trying to say?

116
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,090
We should investigate

117
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,050
based on the suspect's way of thinking.

118
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,360
But we can't handle the case

119
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,920
based on superstitions.

120
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,240
A few years ago,

121
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:05,970
I encountered a similar case.

122
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,210
A college girl

123
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,200
was found dead.

124
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,090
Her body was dumped in two different places.

125
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:15,650
There were cuts on her eyelids.

126
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,240
Her right arm was left in a man-made canal,

127
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,850
and left arm was found on a mountain.

128
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,440
I didn't believe it either, just like you.

129
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,440
- But later...
- Was the case closed?

130
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:25,800
Yes, it was.

131
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,610
Did they find the body

132
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,230
according to your theory?

133
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,360
No, they didn't.

134
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,560
It was vehicle traces

135
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,680
that led to the other half.

136
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,360
You're the only one

137
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,500
who believes in that theory,

138
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,050
- right?
- Yes.

139
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,560
So what did

140
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,000
the murderer say?

141
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,840
He died.

142
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,230
Committed suicide.

143
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,770
There you go.

144
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,920
If you're trying to make a name

145
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,920
before you retire,

146
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,290
this team isn't for you.

147
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,120
Every red circle is

148
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,480
a place of Yang energy.

149
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,560
Go investigate there.

150
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:10,890
Captain Xu,

151
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,610
do you think I'm after the credit?

152
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,050
All I want is to solve the case!

153
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,120
Lin, don't get worked up.

154
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,650
Let's talk this through calmly.

155
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,680
The devil is still at large.

156
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,800
We, the exorcists,

157
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:34,480
should follow the devil's way of thinking
to investigate.

158
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,200
We must bring the suspect to justice.

159
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:40,250
Captain Xu,

160
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,040
give me 20 people.

161
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,090
Fifteen people.

162
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,770
Three days. Maybe two.

163
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,680
I'll get what you're looking for in two days.

164
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:51,840
All the credit

165
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,680
goes to you.

166
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,410
It's been two days.

167
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,510
We've searched almost everywhere.

168
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,680
Everyone's exhausted.

169
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,170
Should we maybe

170
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,560
change our approach?

171
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,920
You're the team leader now.

172
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,370
You need

173
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,170
to brainstorm solutions.

174
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:32,490
Wasn't he

175
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,600
part of the team once?

176
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,800
Even though he's a senior,

177
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,200
he's still pretty capable.

178
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,050
We're short-staffed right now.

179
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,560
Why not bring him on board?

180
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,490
Evil practices are often passed down.

181
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,530
If you don't trust me,

182
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:54,840
I'll look for it myself.

183
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,250
If you fail, it's all on you.

184
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,640
Just two days.

185
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,490
The suspect probably believes

186
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,920
in superstitions stuff.

187
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,130
So, centered on the body discovery site,

188
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,740
within a 10-kilometer radius,

189
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,870
focus on large intersections,

190
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,520
train stations,

191
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,070
long-distance bus stations,

192
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,850
southern slopes of mountains,

193
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,200
and northern riverbanks,

194
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,810

Xiaoxing,

199
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:10,370
any progress?

200
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,010
Nothing for now.

201
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,760
Gosh.

202
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:31,490
Watch your step.

00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,770
Isn't

205
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,290
Lin's plan ridiculous?

206
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,370
We have to explore every possibility.

207
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,600
Think about it.

208
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,890
Our search area is huge,

209
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,130
but why have we

210
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:51,890
only found right hands and feet?

211
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,370
Good point.

212
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:56,890
I think

213
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:57,920
we'd better find it first.

217
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,130
How could you not smell that?

218
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,370
It could be the smell

219
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,250
of some small animal's decaying body.

220
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,720
You can even tell that?

Your nose is as good as a coroner's.

222
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,530
Be careful, boss.

223
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,530
Xiaoxing, should we keep digging?

224
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,370
Keep going.

Go ahead.

232
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,090
Do as told.

233
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,800
Let's move.

234
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:07,440

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,280
Me?

236

I still want to stick to my original plan.

237
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,200
I can't put all my bets

238
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,890
on your method, right?

239
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,440
Hope you understand.

240

243
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,400
I didn't see any.

Captain Xu,

245
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:30,560
did you know?

246
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,410
These past two days,

247
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,490
Lin hasn't found anything either.

248
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,850
Why so excited?

249
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,290
I'm not.

250
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,760
Mr. Lin.

251
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,560
We've already searched three places today.

252
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:01,990
How about we call it a day?

253
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,560
To the mountain.

254
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,250
Hello, Xiaoxing?

255
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,400
Hello?

256
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,530
Wait a second.

257
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:23,680
Hold on a second.

258
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,520
Captain Xu,

259
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,010
Xiaoxing's calling for you.

260
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,530
You still have signal here?

261
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,560
If the signal's bad, try moving outside.

262
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,760
Yeah?

263
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,010
Hello? Wait a second.

264
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,010
Hello?

265
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,010
Can you hear me? Hello?

266
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,250
Hello?

267
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:42,770
I can hear you.

268
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,370
How's it going there?

269
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,410
Four teams searched for two days,

270
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,890
and found nothing.

271
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,050
Everyone

272
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,010
is getting

273
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:52,850
a bit frustrated now.

274
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,950
Stay on the mission.

275
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,490
That's just fine with us.

276
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,170
But I'm worried about Mr. Lin.

277
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,890
Yesterday, we checked seven spots.

278
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,290
We only caught a few hours of sleep

279
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,490
and were out before dawn.

280
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:03,890
We haven't even had lunch yet.

281
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,400
I saw him taking blood pressure pills.

282
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,640
He's older now.

283
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:08,770
What if

284
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,400
something happens

285
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:11,640
to him?

286
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,560
Can't you talk to him?

287
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,290
I tried, but he won't listen.

288
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,560
The thing is,

289
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,690
everyone's wondering

290
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,010
if his plan will work.

291
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,010
He just said it casually,

292
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,050
and we believed him.

293
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,720
Two days' search and nothing.

294
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,210
Do you have a better idea?

295
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:27,330
No, I don't.

296
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:29,330
Alright, I'll head over.

297
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,250
Dafei.

298
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,120
Dafei, come on. Let's go.

299
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,290
Take a break. Have some water.

300
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,290
- Okay.
- Coming.

301
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,090
Captain Xu.

302
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,250
How's it going?

303
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,530
This area

304
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,000
is the last spot on the map.

305
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,640
We've searched it thoroughly.

306
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,050
But Lin refuses to give up.

307
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,720
Let's go.

308
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,450
Mr. Lin insists it's the most likely place.

309
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,400
We searched repeatedly but found nothing.

310
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,560
He won't leave no matter what.

311
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:03,770
Give it to me.

312
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,480
How's it going, Lin?

313
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:08,610
Very promising.

314
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:09,920
Must search carefully.

315
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,960
Look.

316
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:13,290
This area is covered

317
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,880
with pine and cypress trees.

318
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,120
In the past, it was

319
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,400
ideal for burying ashes.

320
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,250
What if you can't find it?

321
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,770
Please, expand it by three kilometers.

322
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:27,130
You are

323
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,640
getting older

324
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,050
and in poor health.

325
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,360
Do you need a break?

326
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:33,530
I'm fine.

327
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,360
Just ask them to help out.

328
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,770
Everyone's exhausted.

329
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,050
But the devil isn't.

330
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:39,800
He won't stop after just two strikes.

331
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,160
It's been two days.

332
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,290
Could there be a flaw

333
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,450
in your theory?

334
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:44,290
Think about it.

335
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,440
Have you found anything?

336
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,160
I haven't

337
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,160
for now.

338
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,930
Then why not try my approach?

339
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:55,530
Lin,

340
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,690
we're shorthanded, you know?

341
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,640
We should focus

342
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,970
on the most likely place.

343
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,560
I'm short on people too.

344
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:03,640
Aren't you currently

345
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,730
not finding anything yet?

346
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:05,950
Fine. It's a trial and error.

347
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,990
I appreciate your effort.

348
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:07,850
Is that okay?

349
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,910
You don't trust me?

350
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,750
My job is to doubt

351
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,330
and explore all possibilities.

352
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,210
Give me one more day

353
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,450
and 20 people.

354
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,360
I'll definitely find it.

355
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,360
Lin, listen to me, will you?

356
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,570
Let's hit pause

357
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,800
and think about this.

358
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,080
You came to me.

359
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,490
I have the right to call a halt.

360
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,160
Why should I stop when you say so,

361
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,730
and start when you say so?

362
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,490
I have to keep looking.

363
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,450
Lin, I'm trying to be supportive

364
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,320
and understanding.

365
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,080
But I'm in charge of the case.

366
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,160
It's an order.

367
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,240
Stop it now.

368
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,450
The remains in the sewer,

369
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,930
were they dumped in the water

370
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,080
or placed on the bank?

371
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,040
In the water of course.

372
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,000
Wrong.

373
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,800
You only found them in the water.

374
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,800
The remains were initially placed

375
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,080
on the banks of the sewer.

376
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,930
Heavy rain washed them into the water.

377
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,080
Dumping in water destroys evidence faster.

378
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,400
Pulling out nails,

379
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:02,070
scraping off fingerprints,

380
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:03,080
and disfigurement—

381
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,530
evidence has already been destroyed.

382
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,450
The suspect isn't just dumping bodies.

383
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:07,880
You have to believe me.

384
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,120
I did.

385
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:10,880
But you end up finding nothing.

386
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:16,970
Alright. Wait a second.

387
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:18,530
Hold on. Come here.

388
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:19,730
Take a look at this.

389
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:20,800
Tell me, what do you see?

390
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,930
Black squares.

391
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:24,770
What else?

392
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,720
Something's flashing.

393
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,530
It's a program to test mental stress,

394
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,370
you know?

395
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,560
If you see white dots flashing,

396
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,970
it means your mental stress level

397
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:36,880
is high already.

398
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,290
It's reached its limit, you know?

399
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:40,160
Your mental state may already...

400
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,120
I'm almost retiring,

401
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,120
what stress could I have?

402
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,840
Stop trying to trick me.

403
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,690
No, this is accurate.

404
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,730
Everyone can see the dots.

405
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,160
We use this tool regularly.

406
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,400
You have to believe in science.

407
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:49,770
Captain Xu,

408
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,480
we have one goal:

409
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,960
find the missing body parts

410
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,220
and solve the case quickly.

411
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,320
Exactly. That's right.

412
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,730
Behind every victim,

413
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,800
there's a broken family.

414
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:18,970
A grieving mother,

415
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,210
and a heartbroken father.

416
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,530
Lin, I totally get it.

417
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,530
We also want to find the body parts fast.

418
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:26,530
But from now on,

419
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,600
we can't afford to waste manpower. Got it?

420
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,610
Then why did you call me?

421
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,050
To test for errors.

422
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,130
I'm not wrong.

423
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,130
I'm not wrong!

424
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:36,890
Put that down.

425
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,610
Put that down.

426
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,820
- Stop it.
- Let go.

427
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,480
Your blood pressure. It's dangerous.

428
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,970
- Hands off.
- Put it down.

429
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,370
- Let go.
- Drop it.

430
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:47,600
I'm good at fighting.

431
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,360
Just put it down.

432
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,570
- Captain Xu.
- Mr. Lin.

433
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,800
Are you okay, Lin?

434
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:01,530
Lin.

435
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,730
Captain Xu, are you alright?

436
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,840
A place of Yang energy.

437
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,880
Call the others.

438
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,720
Okay.

439
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:37,890
Make the call.

440
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:38,890
Alright.

441
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,720
Zhiyong, bring the team up here.

442
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,050
Hurry up.

443
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:04,770
Come over here.

444
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:06,890
Dad.

445
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,400
I'm over here.

446
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:21,860
(Eight Trigrams & Five Elements)

447
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:04,290
Captain Xu.

448
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,090
Are you resting?

449
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,240
Come on in.

450
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:19,690
Aren't you surprised

451
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:21,010
I'm here to find you?

452
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,000
As a detective,

453
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,080
finding people is a basic skill.

454
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:25,530
Have a seat.

455
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,820
("Archaeological Discoveries in China")

456
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,440
So,

457
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,490
how are you?

458
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:37,400
Is everything okay?

459
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,600
You had quite a fall

460
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,760
but didn't go to the hospital.

461
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:41,010
If something goes wrong,

462
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,450
Director Yang will blame me again.

463
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:45,690
Are you here to check on me?

464
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,100
What do you want me to say?

465
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,640
Should I formally apologize

466
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:52,080
for my investigative

467
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,160
approach?

468
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,480
Cut it out.

469
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,770
Don't give me this.

470
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,670
I want to thank you anyway.

471
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,770
Without you, my head would've been crushed.

472
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,190
How's the situation now?

473
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:05,530
It's odd, only two sets of left hand
and foot were found.

474
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,010
Still no torso.

475
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:10,120
No torso?

476
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,690
Maybe the torso was too large.

477
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:13,930
The murderer likely

478
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:14,930
dumped it elsewhere.

479
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,400
Back in your case,

480
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:19,770
was there a torso?

481
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:20,970
Yes.

482
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,360
Buried with the left hand and foot.

483
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:23,730
Could you tell me more

484
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,250
about that case?

485
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,730
A relic smuggler,

486
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:31,960
for reasons unknown,

487
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,250
kidnapped a twenty-year-old college girl.

488
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:41,810
Call the police.

489
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:43,250
Do you remember the plate?

490
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,450
After torturing for days,

491
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,640
kill, chop, and dump.

492
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:49,970
Nothing here.

493
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:50,970
Check over there.

494
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,000
Alright.

495
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:53,530
I'll go check.

496
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:00,450
I've told you everything else.

497
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,930
Yes, then why did you

498
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,080
start thinking of Yin and Yang?

499
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:06,530
Nothing special.

500
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,880
I'm just into it.

501
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,640
Weren't you on the team before?

502
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,490
What's your next plan?

503
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:17,810
Arrange a team

504
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,160
to keep searching.

505
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,740
I need to confirm the victim's identity ASAP.

506
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,520
There's one more thing you should do.

507
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:27,570
What is it?

508
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,350
Find some outside help.

509
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:33,730
Find

510
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:34,690
some outside help?

511
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,030
What kind of outside help?

512
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,180
An expert.

513
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,970
What kind of expert do we need?

514
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,010
Why do we need an expert?

515
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,580
(Han Zhen)
A top expert.

516
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,450
We need his help.

517
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,160
I'll freshen up

518
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,560
and get changed. Let's go find him.

519
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,490
Clean this up.

520
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,400
Hey, Mr. Lin.

521
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:07,160
Are you sure we need him?

522
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,120
Every trade has its own tricks.

523
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,290
He's an expert.

524
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,630
You'll see.

525
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,400
Can you smile?

526
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:17,890
Yeah. Why?

527
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,050
A smile can open hearts.

528
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,640
Excuse me.

529
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,520
I'm here for Professor Han.

530
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:31,050
Over there.

531
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,640
- Thank you.
- No problem.

532
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,680
Professor Han.

533
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:53,570
And you are...

534
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,560
We spoke on the phone this morning.

535
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:00,400
You're Director Zhao

536
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,360
from the Relics Bureau?

537
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,720
Li.

538
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:04,080
Be careful with that.

539
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,560
It's about to break.

540
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:06,850
Got it, sir.

541
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,430
I'm Lin from Public Security Bureau.

542
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:12,010
My poor memory.

543
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:14,050
I apologize.

544
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,160
I've been getting too many calls lately.

545
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:17,770
Six years ago,

546
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:20,360
you helped me crack
a Buddha statue smuggling case.

547
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,600
We had quite the drinks that night.

548
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:23,570
Do you remember?

549
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,530
Six years ago,

550
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:27,530
we drank together?

551
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,560
Looks like you really overdid it that night.

552
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,090
Let me introduce you.

553
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:34,280
This is Captain Xu Xiao

554
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,340
from the Major Crimes Unit.

555
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:38,800
May I ask,

556
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:39,780
what brings you to me?

557
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,570
Sir,

558
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:42,250
please take a look

559
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,290
at these two bodies.

560
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,440
Alright.

561
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,050
Sir, take a look.

562
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,400
What did you find?

563
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:08,160
This is love. So touching.

564
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,600
Not at all.

565
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:11,010
Look.

566
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:12,160
These are clearly

567
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,640
male pelvic bones.

568
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,400
It's two men here.

569
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:17,530
How could it be a double suicide?

570
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,040
Don't waste Mr. Han's time.

571
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,440
Take pictures. Quickly.

572
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,560
This seems to be a murder.

573
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:28,800
This pose suggests a ground struggle.

574
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,800
The one with the head lower

575
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
has rib edges

576
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,730
with clear signs

577
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:34,570
of cut wounds.

578
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,560
And his teeth show contact

579
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,460
with a blood-soaked area
on the other skeleton.

580
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:40,880
This indicates

581
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,150
he bit him during the attack.

582
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,560
There should be a sharp object,

583
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,160
like a dagger, around here.

584
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,290
That must be the murder weapon.

585
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,480
Mr. Han.

586
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:57,330
That's it.

587
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:59,290
That explains it clearly.

588
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,770
The one holding the dagger

589
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,320
stabbed the other person.

590
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:04,400
The other, just before dying,

591
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:05,600
fought back,

592
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,080
biting through the attacker's artery.

593
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,840
They ended up dead together.

594
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,970
The only question is,

595
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,490
what was the motive?

596
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,730
Greed kills.

597
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,520
Perhaps it was about the burial items.

598
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,080
As far as we can tell,

599
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,120
it seems they were

600
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,530
craftsmen buried alive

601
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:21,800
in the tomb passage.

602
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,160
But back then,

603
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,490
none of the treasures could leave.

604
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:28,530
Why would they fight over it?

605
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,090
Unless they had

606
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,730
prepared an escape in advance.

607
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,320
This way, please.

608
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,920
Chen.

609
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,480
Come up here.

610
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,960
Come on.

611
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,250
Let me introduce you.

612
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,010
This is my PhD student,

613
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:01,850
Chen Nan.

614
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,860
Officer Lin
from Public Security Bureau.

615
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,720
Hello, Officer Lin.

616
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:06,570
Sorry.

617
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:08,600
Lin Guoqiang.

618
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,440
Nice to meet you.

619
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:10,890
Nice to meet you.

620
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,570
Xu Xiao, Major Crimes Unit.

621
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:19,400
Please follow me.

622
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,490
Chen, come along.

623
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:24,970
That smile feels so fake.

624
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,290
Both victims

625
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,970
were young women.

626
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,560
I suspect the killer

627
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,050
used the Yin and Yang principle

628
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,640
to dump the bodies.

629
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:46,800
The left hand and foot were

630
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,740
placed in a Yang area.

631
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,640
The right hand, right foot, and head

632
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,680
were placed in a Yin area.

633
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,320
Following this principle,

634
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,670
we located the body parts.

635
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:55,730
You study Yin-Yang too?

636
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,460
A police officer should

637
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:58,790
know a bit of everything.

638
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:00,370
What case is this?

639
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,440
A dismemberment case?

640
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:02,880
Mr. Lin is trying

641
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,840
to figure out

642
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,680
if this case

643
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,160
has anything to do

644
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,560
with any kind of evil practices.

645
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,240
It's highly possible.

646
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:11,370
Looks like

647
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,530
they're performing some kind of ritual.

648
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:15,210
You think so?

649
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,810
Feels like I've seen it somewhere before.

650
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,810
Where have you seen it?

651
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:22,770
Think carefully.

652
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:28,060
It seems to be a special

653
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,860
(Ancient Yu Kingdom is fictional)
death ritual

654
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:30,850
the Ancient Yu Kingdom.

655
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:34,560
It seems to be a unique culture

656
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:35,820
of the Ancient Yu Kingdom.

657
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:36,970
So you mean

658
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:39,280
this suspect's method's related

659
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,080
to the Ancient Yu Kingdom?

660
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:43,560
That was like

661
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,560
a thousand years ago, right?

662
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:46,690
Over 2,000 years.

663
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:52,450
Evil practices

664
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:54,450
could've been passed down.

665
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:57,170
Professor.

666
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:58,370
It's settled then.

667
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,770
We'd like you to be our advisor.

668
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,230
It'll take about a month to wrap up.

669
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:03,850
Alright.

670
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:04,720
No problem.

671
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,560
Wait, sir.

672
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,300
Won't you go to Hong Kong, China?

673
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:09,760
My poor memory.

674
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,890
Before you came,

675
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,760
I applied for an international project.

676
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,560
It's already been approved.

677
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,760
I have to leave tomorrow.

678
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,890
I'll probably be gone for a few months.

679
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,720
Forget it if Professor Han is unavailable.

680
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,890
- Look, it's...
- No worries.

681
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:24,080
Someone can help you.

682
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,120
My student,

683
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,330
Chen Nan, is

684
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:27,990
in her third year of PhD,

685
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:29,330
and has learned

686
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,640
70% of my skills.

687
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:31,650
Not even close.

688
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,080
She's great.

689
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,410
She learned from the best.

690
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,760
Wait.

691
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:39,720
Mr. Lin needs you, sir.

692
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,560
Don't worry.

693
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,970
She's absolutely reliable.

694
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:43,970
I can help,

695
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:46,760
but I have two conditions.

696
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:47,970
Go ahead.

697
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:48,930
First,

698
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,490
I need detailed materials.

699
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,930
Only then can I give professional advice.

700
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,120
No problem.

701
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,720
A Confidentiality Agreement is needed.

702
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,360
Also approval from the bureau's

703
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:58,450
Party committee.

704
00:35:58,450 --> 00:35:59,290
Sure.

705
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,890
Second,

706
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:04,560
I'd like

707
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,560
a designated liaison.

708
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:07,970
So, this... Well...

709
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,240
Lin, it's...

710
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,280
- What?
- Add her.

711
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,240
Wait. What?

712
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,080
Add her on WeChat.

713
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:14,930
Add each other.

714
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:15,940
Either of you will do.

715
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,120
I just want to share some academic articles

716
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,120
for your reference.

717
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,850
No problem. Then...

718
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:21,920
Sir, I'll get back to work.

719
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,240
- Alright.
- I...

720
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,490
Discuss it and get me later.

721
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:25,330
Okay.

722
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:26,650
Pick up the pace.

723
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:28,290
Get it done quickly.

724
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,490
I drove for two hours.

725
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:40,640
What am I even doing here?

726
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,330
I admit,

727
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:44,600
the killer's body disposal method

728
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,530
might be related

729
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:47,240
to some superstitious stuff.

730
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:49,720
But 2,000 years ago?

731
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:51,060
Isn't that a bit absurd?

732
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,570
I've been a cop for over 20 years.

733
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,380
This is the first time I needed

734
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:59,450
an Archaeology PhD to help solve a case.

735
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:01,930
Do you even think she's reliable?

736
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:37,330
Both victims were young women.

737
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,810
I suspect the killer

738
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:41,810
used the Yin and Yang principle

739
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:42,680
to dump the bodies.

740
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:20,720
Guo.

741
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,720
Anything new there?

742
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,600
Feeling refreshed, huh?

743
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,490
What's going on?

744
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:26,330
Come on.

745
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:28,370
Let me give you an update.

746
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:30,850
So far, we can only confirm

747
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:32,030
both victims are

748
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,340
between 20 to 25 years old,

749
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:36,160
and died about 10 days ago.

750
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:38,640
This body's fingerprints are destroyed.

751
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:39,930
Come check the other.

752
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,080
Aside

753
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:54,490
from this tattoo,

754
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,370
everything else

755
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:57,050
has been cleaned by the murderer.

756
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,600
And it has been soaking for long,

757
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:00,970
so it cannot be matched.

758
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:04,970
Any updates on the missing persons?

759
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:06,730
Not yet.

760
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:11,330
Guo.

761
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:12,980
Provincial Department's calling.

762
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,520
Guo,

763
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,280
can you do a detailed skin test

764
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,160
on this body?

765
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:31,770
Guo?

766
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,040
Guo?

767
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:36,370
Guo Jinyi?

768
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:42,210

770
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:54,850
Liuzi?

771
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:56,770
Liuzi?

773
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,080
Hi, Mr. Lin.

774
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:08,250
Have a seat.

775
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,410
I just dreamed of playing ball

776
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,530
with you, Mr. Lin.

777
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:16,370
And here you are.

778
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:18,200
Playing ball, huh?

779
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,600
Thanks, Mr. Lin.

780
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:25,170
What is it?

781
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,200
That's brutal.

782
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,160
Found the torso yet?

783
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,400
No.

784
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:34,960
It's creepy.

785
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,450
Anything in the antique business lately?

786
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:39,010
Nothing much.

787
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,640
Are you suspecting

788
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,890
some antique dealer?

789
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:43,450
Just a suspicion.

790
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:45,160
In your line of work,

791
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,120
evil practices abound.

792
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:48,120
Nothing much recently.

793
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:50,890
However...

794
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,560
Shoot.

795
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,160
If this guy kills based

796
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,450
on superstitions,

797
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:01,440
it must be more than two.

798
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,340
You think?

799
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:03,330
I mean,

800
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,050
Five Elements, Dipper Stars.

801
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:05,980
Seven times seven is 49.

802
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Nine times nine is 81.

803
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:09,890
And 12,

804
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:11,720
36, and 72.

805
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:12,590
What?

806
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:13,930
- And 12.
- What?

807
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:15,530
- Twelve.
- Twelve.

808
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:16,370
Thirty-six.

809
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,480
Thirty-six.

810
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:18,810
Seventy-two.

811
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:20,690
One hundred and eight.

812
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,120
What's this?

813
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:27,700
Think about it, inside the tombs,

814
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:29,970
whether it's people
or livestock buried alongside,

815
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,270
doesn't it end up the same?

816
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,530
So, how many people did they actually kill?

817
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,530
I think

818
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,450
it might be tied to certain

819
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:37,690
unique numbers.
