00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,810
(Fuxing Road, Ping'an Road,
Jianshe Road, Qingnian Road)

4
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,600
Can't she pick up the offer letter herself?

5
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:09,970
Why do we have to deliver it?

6
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,210
Just drive.

7
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,360
These colors,

8
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,930
patterns, and sizes are all different.

9
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,210
Record everything in detail.

10
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,280
Look.

11
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,400
Alright.

12
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,800
The stratigraphic succession

13
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,720
is significant.

14
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,320
These materials are valuable.

15
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,160
Hello.

16
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,800
You're right on time.

17
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,280
Here's your offer letter.

18
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,880
Your leadership agreed to hire me?

19
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,160
Specially approved by the Party committee.

20
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,900
(Letter of Appointment)

21
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,880
Are you taking us to the archaeological site

22
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,320
of the Ancient Yu Kingdom?

23
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,160
Yeah, it's right here.

24
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,120
This is it?

25
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,460
Why didn't you mention it last time?

26
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,720
You hadn't hired me yet back then.

27
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,530
This tomb

28
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,610
is from

29
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:17,560
the Yu Kingdom.

30
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,080
About three years ago,

31
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,840
we discovered its location

32
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,440
and began protective development.

33
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,920
The main work has been completed,

34
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,050
but the follow-up remains.

35
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,160
Wait, wait.

36
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,720
- What?
- You can't come down here.

37
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,400
Alright.

38
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:37,610
Fine.

39
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,690
Some follow-up's ongoing.

40
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,760
So we haven't re-buried it yet.

41
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,440
By the way, thanks to both of you.

42
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,570
What you two mentioned last time

43
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:46,600
gave me some inspiration.

44
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,970
So, I did some research.

45
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,920
The location of the human sacrifice pits

46
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,920
does follow the Yin-Yang

47
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,780
opposing principle.

48
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,740
(Northwest, Yin; Southeast, Yang)

49
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,890
Southeast and northwest of the central axis

50
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,130
are two burial pits.

51
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,720
In the southeast pit,

52
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,800
the left hands, feet,

53
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,720
and torsos are buried.

54
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,760
In the northwest pit, the right hands,

55
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,280
feet, and skull.

56
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,730
Does that resemble your case?

57
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,010
Southeast is Yang.

58
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,160
Northwest is Yin.

59
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,360
Exactly.

60
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,490
But what's the purpose behind it?

61
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,220
The purpose

62
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,700
might be for

63
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,300
warding off evil,

64
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,580
banishing spirits,

65
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,950
and suppressing vengeful souls.

66
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,940
In ancient times,

67
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,820
many burial pits like this existed.

68
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,460
But this particular arrangement

69
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,740
is quite unusual.

70
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,700
Who were these people?

71
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,820
Young women.

72
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,980
Well,

73
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,460
according to your theory,

74
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,940
uh…

75
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,820
Shouldn't this skeleton be

76
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,820
in the sacrificial pit?

77
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,940
Why is it outside?

78
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,060
We've checked it.

79
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,220
This one is male.

80
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,700
Probably,

81
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,460
the tomb owner's servant or craftsman.

82
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,940
Has this tomb

83
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,900
been looted before?

84
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,020
Nine out of ten.

85
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,460
Especially the Han tombs.

86
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,020
We actually followed a robber's tunnel

87
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,900
straight into the main chamber.

88
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,860
After clearing the sediment,

89
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,100
we opened the door.

90
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,220
How did you find the tunnel?

91
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,460
Can't reveal that.

92
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,780
At the time,

93
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,700
we noticed a subtle dip

94
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,660
on the surface.

95
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,820
We tested it with a Luoyang shovel.

96
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,500
At about two meters deep,

97
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,710
the shovel hit a hollow spot.

98
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,420
I'll let you get on.

99
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,340
Feel free to look around.

100
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,140
Just don't touch anything.

101
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,540
Okay.

102
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,220
Don't touch anything, okay?

103
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:04,940
Got it.

104
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,420
Hello?

105
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,660
Can you handle it yourself?

106
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,020
I'm willing to help.

107
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,500
No need.

108
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,820
I'll take care of it.

109
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,060
I'll clean it up

110
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:45,940
and be there in a bit.

111
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,860
Alright.

112
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,940
Take a picture here. Get everything.

113
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,860
Sure.

114
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,500
We analyzed the tomb path.

115
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,700
It had water intrusion,

116
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,140
which prevented further looting

117
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,400
and preserved many artifacts.

118
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,220
In the tomb passage,

119
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,660
we found burial bamboo slips

120
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,290
and the remains of the tomb owner.

121
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,100
Using instruments,

122
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,060
we made an interesting discovery.

123
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,220
What kind of discovery?

124
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,780
What do you mean?

125
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,020
These are the bamboo slips we found.

126
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,940
There are a few words written on it.

127
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,660
(Shuoyang Institute of Archaeology)
King Qi of Yu

128
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,220
died in the fourth year of Qianyuan.

129
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,380
Qianyuan was the reign title

130
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,980
of Emperor Jing of Han.

131
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,660
The fourth year of Qianyuan

132
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,420
would be 152 BC.

133
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,060
But what's strange is,

134
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,780
King Qi of Yu was born

135
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,900
in the 33rd year of Emperor Qinshihuang,

136
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,700
which is 214 BC.

137
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,460
He lived 62 years.

138
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,180
Quite a long life for that era.

139
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,740
Sixty-two isn't that surprising.

140
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,020
For a ruler who was

141
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:57,860
well taken care of.

142
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,770
Right?

143
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,620
I'm not done yet.

144
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,780
Then, we

145
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,740
scanned his skull. Turns out,

146
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,500
his actual biological age

147
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,620
was only around 40.

148
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,500
Your testing equipment

149
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,980
must have malfunctioned.

150
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,260
Impossible.

151
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,620
We tested it multiple times.

152
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,460
Then maybe back then,

153
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,940
the person recording made a mistake.

154
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,700
So why are you coming to me?

155
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,620
The victim in our case

156
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,100
had X-shaped cuts on the eyelids.

157
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,540
Any similar features

158
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,100
in the tomb sacrifices?

159
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,300
Most of what we found were decayed bones.

160
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,740
We didn't see those signs on them.

161
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,740
Senior, we finished.

162
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,020
Let's go.

163
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,340
- It's done?
- Just listen.

164
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,260
It's assembled.

165
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,820
See?

166
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,100
Our job is

167
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,220
to decode history.

168
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,060
Does this discovery

169
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,300
help with our case?

170
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,380
It may not help

171
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,580
with your case,

172
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,220
but it's valuable

173
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,660
for the study

174
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,820
of ancient history.

175
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,100
I wonder

176
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,300
what secrets lie

177
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,180
inside this ancient skull.

178
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,300
Careful.

179
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,460
Don't step on it.

180
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,380
Why not ask her?

181
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,540
Yesterday afternoon

182
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,500
and this morning.

183
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,500
A full day

184
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,420
was wasted like that.

185
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,980
I think it's worth considering.

186
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,260
That girl is remarkable.

187
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,780
I've admitted it

188
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,700
that the killer

189
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,100
might be superstitious.

190
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,340
But he's somehow related
to someone from 2,000 years ago,

191
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,900
and that person reversed aging?

192
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,180
I just can't buy it.

193
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,020
Also, Lin.

194
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,020
Well,

195
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,580
your idea…

196
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,860
Your theory,

197
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,360
does it have some flaws?

198
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,620
Otherwise, why haven't we

199
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,980
found the torsos yet?

200
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,220
He'll kill more.

201
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,260
Three, five, seven, nine.

202
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,180
Nine…

203
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,300
Let me see.

204
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,380
Twelve.

205
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,340
Thirty-six.

206
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,100
Forty-nine, seventy-two.

207
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,660
- Come on.
- Eighty-one.

208
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,940
It's about these numbers.

209
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,380
Lin.

210
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,460
Let's go to the forensic lab

211
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,900
and just focus on science first.

212
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,780
Alright?

213
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,700
You don't trust me?

214
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,700
No, it's just our work requires

215
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,860
evidence based on science,

216
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,700
not historical assumptions.

217
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,020
Guo's report is already out.

218
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,340
Let's go check it first, okay?

219
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,580
All scientific achievements

220
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,580
start with imagination.

221
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,980
(Forensic Report)

222
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,420
Hi, Guo.

223
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,060
Here you are.

224
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,220
According to the report,

225
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,980
the victims' skin was in poor condition

226
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,100
due to dryness.

227
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,580
Both victims had a similar trait.

228
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,340
Based on your theory, Captain Xu,

229
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,580
I ran repeated experiments on it.

230
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,140
Your theory was proven correct.

231
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,700
Frequent bathing caused it.

232
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,780
Now,

233
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,460
explain this to me.

234
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,620
The skin color on the back of the hands,

235
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,500
fingers, and palms

236
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,820
differ slightly.

237
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,380
It's still visible after soaking in water.

238
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,340
Why?

239
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,300
Manicures.

240
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,420
Getting a manicure

241
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,170
exposes fingers to UV light.

242
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,020
And frequent sessions

243
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:03,940
can darken the skin.

244
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,490
Dafei,

245
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,500
contact Captain Zhao
from Anti-Pornography Squad.

246
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,380
Ask him

247
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,820
to join us for a joint search.

248
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,180
The target area?

249
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:24,660
Binxi New District.

250
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,700
Start from the spot
close to the dumping site,

251
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,100
then expand outwards.

252
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,260
Wait.

253
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,580
Why the Anti-Pornography Squad?

254
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,980
At first, Xiaoxing told me,

255
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,380
there were no reports of missing persons.

256
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,620
That got me thinking,

257
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,220
it might involve women

258
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,100
engaged in illegal activities.

259
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,940
They're often estranged from family.

260
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,430
Even if they go missing,

261
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,620
no one might report it.

262
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,620
So, Guo,

263
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,700
I need his help

264
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,340
to gather more evidence

265
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,940
to confirm my theory.

266
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,820
You want them to identify the body parts?

267
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,260
Yes.

268
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,140
Look, Captain Xu

269
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,300
truly believes in science.

270
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:08,620
However,

271
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,540
you stick to your science

272
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,780
while I handle my part.

273
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,660
All conclusions

274
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,180
begin with a hypothesis.

275
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,700
Go with my theory for now.

276
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,660
Alright.

277
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,540
Captain Xu,

278
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,780
check among this group

279
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,100
to see if anyone recognizes it.

280
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,500
Some more

281
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,420
are on the way.

282
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,260
Alright. Thanks.

283
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,180
Captain.

284
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,220
- How's it going?
- Asking now.

285
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,140
Hurry up.

286
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,700
Take a look at this photo.

287
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,940
Does anyone you know have this tattoo?

288
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,700
Don't be afraid.

289
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,820
Think carefully.

290
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,270
Don't be afraid.

291
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,740
If you recognize this tattoo,

292
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,300
let me know

293
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,980
so we can solve the case faster.

294
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,730
The sooner we find the killer,

295
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,020
the safer

296
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,940
everyone will be.

297
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,420
I...

298
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,170
You know this tattoo?

299
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,060
Are you sure?

300
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,940
I'm sure.

301
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,180
I've seen it too.

302
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,420
What's your name?

303
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,660
Ye Xiaolan.

304
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,180
And you?

305
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,300
I'm Qin Fang.

306
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,670
Ai Lin.

307
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,600
It's Ai Lin.

308
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,700
Are you sure it's that tattoo?

309
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,660
We went together

310
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,380
to get it.

311
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,260
Any other features

312
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,340
you remember?

313
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,900
She had

314
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,940
a fracture in her right shin before.

315
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,340
The X-ray does show a fracture.

316
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,300
How long has she been missing?

317
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,940
About three months.

318
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,460
Do you know where she lived?

319
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,300
We lived together.

320
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,260
Guo, let's go.

321
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,060
Let's see if we can find the torso.

322
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,300
Alright.

323
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,650
Feel free to look around.

324
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,780
This is my place.

325
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,780
That girl used to live here.

326
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:34,770
Her bedroom's upstairs?

327
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:35,940
Yes.

328
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,780
Which items here were originally hers?

329
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,780
Only the immovable ones.

330
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,980
I threw out everything else when I moved in.

331
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,620
When I threw her photos out,

332
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,020
I noticed her tattoo in one of them.

333
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,220
Well,

334
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,380
have the desk, cabinets, or sofa been moved?

335
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,100
No.

336
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,220
Guo, check upstairs.

337
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,140
I'm on it.

338
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,580
Officer,

339
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,460
can I pack my things first?

340
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,060
I can't stay here anymore.

341
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,300
This is too calamitous.

342
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,700
Wait until we finish collecting evidence.

343
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,010
Can you tell me

344
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,340
did she

345
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,460
die in this house?

346
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,260
We'll know after the investigation.

347
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,940
Gosh.

348
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,700
(Scene Investigation)

349
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,140
Captain Xu.

350
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,740
- What is it?
- Look.

351
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,000
So much disinfectant.

352
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,620
Not so much.

353
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,310
A whole box's in the cabinet.

354
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:25,960
Why stockpile so much?

355
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,780
(Scene Investigation)

356
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,220
Do you usually

357
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,940
stockpile that much disinfectant?

358
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,260
I'm a clean freak.

359
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,780
I disinfect daily.

360
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,860
But that much?

361
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:09,980
Captain Xu.

362
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,950
Do you think

363
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,110
it's this woman?

364
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,300
She committed the crime here in this room?

365
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,580
Why else stockpile so much disinfectant?

366
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,780
Do you have evidence?

367
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,620
It's speculation.

368
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,370
Even speculation needs proof.

369
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:31,980
Xiaoxing.

370
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:40,900
Officer,

371
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,140
what's going on?

372
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,700
Are you the landlord?

373
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,260
I'm the janitor.

374
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,740
Where's the landlord?

375
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:49,900
Abroad.

376
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,660
The landlord

377
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,980
owns over 20 apartments here.

378
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,900
It's for investment.

379
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,820
I'm just running them.

380
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,980
Do you remember the girl in Room 701?

381
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,940
Yeah, I do.

382
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:02,900
Not very tall,

383
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,700
but quite pretty.

384
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,140
Sometimes she even owed rent.

385
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,060
She lived here

386
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,140
for almost a year.

387
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,420
But recently she just disappeared.

388
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,520
Couldn't reach her at all.

389
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,620
So I rented it to someone else.

390
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,480
Got a rental contract?

391
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,620
Yes, wait a moment.

392
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,980
You are...

393
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,300
I'm a cleaner.

394
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,780
What's going on here?

395
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,140
The last girl who stayed here

396
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:30,980
left without a word.

397
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,980
We're just checking.

398
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,900
She didn't just leave.

399
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,020
Something happened to her.

400
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,060
Do you know what happened?

401
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,100
When Ma called me to clean,

402
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,500
there were still clothes
hanging on the balcony.

403
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,900
The dishes were unwashed.

404
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,660
Ma said when he came in,

405
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,380
the air conditioner was still on.

406
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,660
Doesn't seem like someone who left for good.

407
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,660
Officer,

408
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,580
here.

409
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,100
The rental contract.

410
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,260
When this girl rented the place,

411
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,060
she signed the rental contract.

412
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:58,180
(Zhang Yin)

413
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,460
Where

414
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,220
are the girl's

415
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,140
personal belongings?

416
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,260
I told her to throw it all out.

417
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,580
Throw it out?

418
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,780
Yes.

419
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,660
Are you sure

420
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,000
everything was thrown away?

421
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,780
Didn't keep anything useful for yourself?

422
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,660
Officer,

423
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,250
what do you take me for?

424
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,220
I don't need that.

425
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,140
Our family owns several relocation houses.

426
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,220
Why would I need to do that?

427
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,420
Besides,

428
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,310
even if I did,

429
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:27,260
it wouldn't be her stuff.

430
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,260
Something did happen to her.

431
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,700
She's gone.

432
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,820
It's pretty tragic.

433
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,060
If you know anything,

434
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,380
you'd better tell me.

435
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,300
Alright.

436
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,980
Good thing I didn't keep it.

437
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,700
- So unlucky.
- Yeah.

438
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,300
I'll keep this contract as evidence.

439
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,420
I'll leave you be.

440
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,660
- Alright. See you.
- Sure.

441
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,940
Dafei.

442
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,860
Dafei?

443
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,420
What's wrong?

444
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,700
That janitor

445
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,740
and the cleaning lady…

446
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,220
Captain Xu,

447
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,680
she cleaned thoroughly.

448
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,630
Even the floor drain is spotless.

449
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,840
No idea how much she used.

450
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,340
Just do your best.

451
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,620
Got it.

452
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,850
Captain Xu,

453
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:11,990
this is Ye Xiaolan's place.

454
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,710
Let's take a look inside.

455
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,300
Packing for a long trip?

456
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,810
I'm just tidying up.

457
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:25,940
How many rooms

458
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,860
upstairs?

459
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,220
Just a loft.

460
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,430
Do you have Ai Lin's belongings here?

461
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,380
I don't.

462
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,380
How about the gift she gave you

463
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,020
or clothes she wore?

464
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,540
Weren't you two pretty close?

465
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,060
No, I don't.

466
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,110
We're collecting some of

467
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,980
Ai Lin's personal items as evidence.

468
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,060
But the janitor said

469
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,210
everything was thrown out.

470
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,100
I don't have any.

471
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,380
We weren't

472
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,580
that close.

473
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,620
Alright.

474
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,420
Do you know

475
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,420
if Ai Lin

476
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,020
had any other jobs?

477
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,500
She didn't.

478
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,460
She just took some gigs online.

479
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,740
After gigs, she'd come back here?

480
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:50,920
No.

481
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:52,260
Did she stay at a regular hotel?

482
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,260
I'm not sure about that.

483
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,660
I work at nightclubs.

484
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,860
We're not in the same circle.

485
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:02,020
Did she ever mention

486
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,440
anything about her clients?

487
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,500
No, she didn't.

488
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,220
We don't talk about that.

489
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,300
What do you two talk about?

490
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,160
Money.

491
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,040
And

492
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,140
how to make more of it.

493
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:16,620
Did she have a boyfriend?

494
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,700
Or

495
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,380
any men she was

496
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,300
close with?

497
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:23,340
Not that I know of.

498
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,860
Maybe she dated before,

499
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,780
but it didn't last.

500
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,100
Actually,

501
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,700
she wanted to quit next year,

502
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,030
thinking of going back home
for a simple life.

503
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,140
Captain Xu,

504
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,260
look at what I found.

505
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,380
Speak.

506
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,940
I'm the one who took it.

507
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,940
But hear me out, please.

508
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,860
It's not what you think.

509
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,780
You know what?

510
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,540
This is just a small hobby of mine.

511
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,060
It's not just some innocent hobby.

512
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,740
At your age,

513
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,820
doing this kind of thing?

514
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,700
Sir, that's storage.

515
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,620
Go on.

516
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,020
Half the building's full of girls like her.

517
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,460
I'm 55 years old

518
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,580
and still single.

519
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,100
Isn't this just torture?

520
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,220
I don't have money, so I just…

521
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,260
How'd you get the stuff?

522
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,780
Fixing lights,

523
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,220
internet,

524
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,140
and water meters.

525
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,980
Just easy pickings.

526
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:08,980
Sir,

527
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,940
this is no major crime, right?

528
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,980
If they report, you might

529
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,940
get detained.

530
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,060
Captain Xu, we checked.

531
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,290
This probably isn't the scene.

532
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,940
It's your chance to redeem yourself.

533
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,700
Tell me.

534
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,940
Did the girl have any close friends?

535
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,140
Especially male?

536
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,060
No.

537
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,260
She always kept to herself.

538
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:33,980
Slept during the day

539
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,180
and went out at night.

540
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,660
What else did you do? Speak.

541
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,580
Don't make me ask.

542
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,540
I didn't do anything.

543
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,020
You think I did it?

544
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,300
You flatter me.

545
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:46,300
I get weak just killing a bullfrog.

546
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:48,020
Okay, I did hide something.

547
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,380
But I wasn't the first

548
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,540
to take her stuff.

549
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,660
Who?

550
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,180
Her friend from next door.

551
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:11,940
That's all?

552
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,660
Are these Ai Lin's?

553
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,340
I thought she wasn't coming back, so I...

554
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,260
How did you even get into her place?

555
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,020
I had her door code.

556
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,980
That's theft. Definitely theft.

557
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:26,980
Not your call.

558
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,420
What's it got to do with you,

559
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,340
you old perv?

560
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,320
How many girls' underwear

561
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:32,330
have you stolen, huh?

562
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,180
He even touched me.

563
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,300
He touched me!

564
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,300
Where did I touch you?

565
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,420
Do you dare say that?

566
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,820
Alright. Stop arguing.

567
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,190
Take it to the police station.

568
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,180
Dafei, call the evidence team up.

569
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,220
Take them away.

570
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,140
Yes.

571
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,260
Move.

572
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,660
Let's go.

573
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,020
(Police)

574
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,740
Extract the DNA

575
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,000
from the clothes and jewelry

576
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,280
and compare it with the victim's.

577
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:32,690
Confirm the identity again.

578
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:33,700

See if there are new leads.

582
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,500
Alright.

Zheng,

584
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,980

585

all missing persons

586
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,740
for the past two years.

587
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,950
- Don't miss anyone.
- Got it.

588
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,380
Get to work.

589
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,660
Alright.

593
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,900
- Hello.
- Director Yang.

594
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,020
Here's the thing.

595
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,780
You know him, right?

596
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,570
- We've met in meetings.
- Alright.

597
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:08,610
- Captain Shang.
- Hi.

598
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:09,460
Alright.

599
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,740
This is Song Mi.

600
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,660
Hello, Captain Xu.

601
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,280
They need your assistance

602
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,740
on something.

603
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,500
No problem. What do you need?

604
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,460
Here's the situation.

605
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,500
We had a case

606
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,480
that's officially closed,

607
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:21,500
but a woman named Cao Jinxi

608
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,540
was never found.

609
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,420
DNA from the scene

610
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,500
didn't match anyone.

611
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,180
So we wanted to check with you

612
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,340
to see if you have any clues.

613
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,620
Any details?

614
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:31,900
Yes.

615
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,740
She's about 25 years old.

616
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,490
Director Yang mentioned,

617
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,820
the victims in the 8/13 case
were also young women,

618
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,780
who frequented nightclubs as well.

619
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,660
(Resident Registration Info, Zhang Yin)

620
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,860
The most critical point now is,

621
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,020
the time the family's report

622
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,660
matches the death time

623
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,820
from your forensic analysis.

624
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,260
So we'd like our Coroner Xia

625
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,120
to come and collect

626
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:52,020
some DNA samples

627
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,380
for comparison.

628
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,740
I see. No problem.

629
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,660
Well,

630
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,620
I'll take a look.

631
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,540
We'll fully cooperate.

632
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,580
- Alright.
- Thanks.

633
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,420
Not at all.

634
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:02,940
Regarding this case,

635
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,060
any updates?

636
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,300
We've identified one victim.

637
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:07,740
Her name's Ai Lin.

638
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,340
We suspect she was a sex worker.

639
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,840
DNA is being extracted

640
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,740
for comparison

641
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,720
to confirm her identity.

642
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,220
The other needs further screening.

643

645
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,220
has been supervising the case.

Okay.

- That's settled.
- Alright.

how have you been?

00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,500
I've been

663
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,420
a bit busy lately.

664
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,620
Couldn't find time to visit you.

665
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,540

Alright.

669
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,340
Mom, you should try

670
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,500
to move around more.

671
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,260
You can't just lie down or sit all day.

672

675
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,780
But today

676
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,660
I slacked off a little.

677
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,740
You can't slack off.

678
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,180

00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,500
I hope to see my grandkids one day.

683
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,100
I'll keep walking.

684
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,420
What about…

685
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,420
you know who?

686
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,540

No.

A couple of days ago,

689
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,980
he went on a business trip.

Alright.

691
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,760

695
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,220
Got it.

696
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,980
Don't worry so much, okay?

697
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,140
Just rest up.

698
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,300
I'll be back soon.

Here.

710
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,100
We extracted DNA

711
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,580
from the underwear and the jewelry.

712
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,620

After comparison, it matches the body.

713
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,740
The victim is Ai Lin.

714
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:11,620
What about the other?

715
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,020
The other one is named An Qi.

716
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,420
She had a tongue piercing

717
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,640
and a birthmark on her scalp.

718
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,740
Both are inconspicuous.

719
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:21,860
No wonder

720
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,620
the suspect didn't erase them.

721
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,500
What about the janitor? Anything?

722
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:27,300
No.

With his condition,

739
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,740
is surgery needed?

740
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,500

749

But he has heart disease and hypertension.

750
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,460
You need to be cautious.

751
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,980
He can go home now.

752
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,140
Just needs proper rest.

753

762
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,460
It was him. I almost caught him.

763
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,460
He was dumping a body.

764
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,420

765

00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:48,700
(Information)

771
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,310
What are you looking for?

772
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,540
A shovel.

773
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,460
A shovel?

774
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,700
What does it look like?

775
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,420
Is it this one?

776
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,020
That's yours?

777
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,500
Better than a baton.

778
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,300
Did you see his face?

779
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:33,780
No.

780
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,780
You said he's left-handed?

781
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,020
He attacked me with his left hand.

782
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,320
His weight was on his right foot.

783
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,580
Is this place of Yang energy, too?

784
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:49,820
It is.

785
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,940
But he probably won't come back.

786
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,300
Lin, look.

787
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,620
Looks like a minivan tire print.

788
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:15,980
Hello, Captain Xu.

789
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,900
Xiaoxing, I've sent you a location.

790
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,860
Check the nearby surveillance.

791
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,290
See if there's a minivan passing by.

792
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,380
Zheng Jiong.

793
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,960
Captain Xu just sent a location.

794
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,220
Look for minivans

795
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,660
in the surrounding surveillance.

796
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,140
Got it.

797
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,420
Captain Xu.

798
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,810
It's all suburban and rural roads.

799
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:45,820
Total blind spots.

800
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,980
Widen the search area.

801
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,580
Focus around 11 p.m.

802
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,500
Minivans.

803
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,700
Keep me posted.

804
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,020
Copy that.

805
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,420
Widening search.

806
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,500
Camera detectors are easy to buy online.

807
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,700
Avoiding us isn't hard.

808
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,940
If it were you, what would you do?

809
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,880
I'd destroy the evidence first.

810
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,100
There's water nearby.

811
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:14,540
Should we follow the GPS

812
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,500
and check it out?

813
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,420
Is it far?

814
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,340
GPS says it's close.

815
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,620
