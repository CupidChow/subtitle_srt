=Episode 12=

3
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:16,730
Want a drink?

4
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,930
You care about Lin a lot.

5
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,820
Who cares about a stubborn old man?

6
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,890
I handled a case two years ago.

7
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,500
A modest couple

8
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,490
helped a kid from a poor family,

9
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,330
from primary school to high school.

10
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,300
But once he finished high school, he changed.

11
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,510
He decided not to prepare for college.

12
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,490
The couple stopped supporting him.

13
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,170
Then the kid said

14
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,330
he wanted to cook them a meal

15
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,210
to thank them for their years of help.

16
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:00,770
The couple was thrilled.

17
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,100
They bought ingredients

18
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,400
and waited for the boy at home.

19
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,770
But the boy showed up with a knife.

20
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,450
The wife died instantly.

21
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,770
The husband was severely injured.

22
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,890
After being rescued,

23
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,690
he was left with lifelong disabilities.

24
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,450
So,

25
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,450
you stopped trusting others.

26
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,690
At any time, human emotions

27
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:26,890
should never outweigh reason.

28
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,020
Can you do that?

29
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:04,940
I'm sorry

30
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,210
I couldn't help.

31
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:09,820
I'll be leaving tomorrow.

32
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,420
The rent is 500 yuan.

33
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,840
Don't try to bargain with me.

34
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:18,930
It's not expensive.

35
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,340
Go back and study hard.

36
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:34,260
Don't cry, Ding Dang.

37
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:46,540
What's wrong?

38
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,140
I just remembered.

39
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,610
Captain Xu!

40
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:10,780
What is it?

41
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,940
A man wearing a wig.

42
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,820
It was two men.

43
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,700
She said they are wearing

44
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,770
dark hoodies.

45
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,050
Thanks for the effort.

46
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,700
I told you that guy moved strangely.

47
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,770
Can we confirm based on his movements?

48
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,340
It's worth a try.

49
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,540
Dafei, I need everything

50
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,530
on Wang Bingde.

51
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,340
Zheng, help him.

52
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,910
- Got it
- Got it.

53
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,100
Wait a second.

54
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,660
Take a pepper spray with you,

55
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,540
just in case.

56
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,460
Thanks for caring.

57
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,620
Why is the garage so dim today?

58
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,410
Is one of the lights broken?

59
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,460
No worries, I'm going.

60
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,780
Alright.

61
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,700
Are you sure you don't need me

62
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,580
to take you up?

63
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:45,700
No need.

64
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,580
Get home early.

65
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,690
- Alright, bye.
- Bye.

(Resident Registration Info)

67
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:38,460
Captain,

68
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,470
this's the initial data...

69
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,620
Here's Wang Bingde's family registry info.

70
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,430
Xiaoxing said it still takes more time

71
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,810
to get his cash flow and data flow.

72
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:54,900
Thanks for that.

73
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,110
I'm fine.

74
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,940
Lin is sleeping in the office.

75
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,490
How dare I complain?

76
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,050
Come on, have breakfast.

77
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,580
(Resident Registration Info)

78
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,250
Awake now?

79
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,130
Eat something first.

80
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:27,690
That's him, right?

81
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:30,810
Indeed.

82
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,680
Isn't this the person

83
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:33,850
whom the curator drew for me?

84
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:34,890
He said it was

85
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,390
the mysterious buyer of the tripod.

86
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,260
He's Wang Yixuan.

87
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,160
Wang Yixuan is Wang Bingde's child

88
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,220
with his ex-wife.

89
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,220
This makes Wang Bingde even more suspicious.

90
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,400
Investigate him immediately.

91
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,590
Got it, I'm on it now.

92
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,980
We've finally found a connection!

93
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,100
Don't worry about the rest. I'll handle it.

94
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,260
- Okay.
- Alright, take it.

95
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,740
Let me check the tie.

96
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,180
Dad,

97
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,860
our team has a match tonight.

98
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,610
You and Mom must come watch in person!

99
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,340
Alright, I will definitely be there.

100
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,460
Bye.

101
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,730
Captain Xu, Wang Bingde is out.

102
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:37,700
Dafei,

103
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,730
follow him.

104
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,700
See where he goes.

105
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,580
Got it.

106
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,730
His youngest son is 17,

107
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,170
but looks like he's 27.

108
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,850
We need to confirm again

109
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,290
whether he is wearing a wig.

110
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:16,860
Hello? Captain Xu.

111
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,480
Based on the current information,

112
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,230
Wang Bingde's call records

113
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,600
(Zheng Jiong)
and financial transactions

114
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:23,880
are all clean and normal.

115
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,320
Plus, he has no criminal record.

116
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,620
He's just a regular building company owner.

117
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,620
(Wang Bingde)

118
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,020
His call records are normal,

119
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,410
but he did contact

120
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,550
Zhou Daye six months ago.

121
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,190
Other than that, just calls to his wife

122
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,260
and some business partners.

123
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,960
What kind of projects does he handle?

124
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,540
His company

125
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,300
specializes in two areas.

126
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,680
At the beginning, it involved the excavation

127
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,970
and transportation of earthworks.

128
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,700
Later, it shifted to landscape greening.

129
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,140
Earthworks?

130
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,020
Interesting.

131
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,510
That means if there's an ancient tomb

132
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,420
under a housing,

133
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:54,740
he's the first to know about it.

134
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,660
Zheng, well done!

135
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,940
Keep digging deeper.

136
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,820
Got it.

137
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,620
Mr. Zhao,

138
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,900
I'd like to visit you.

139
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,690
Fang, what are you up to?

140
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,380
Checking stocks.

141
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,140
Don't check it all the time.

142
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,060
Get out to do sports more often.

143
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,940
Got it, stop nagging.

144
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,060
What's for lunch today?

145
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,540
I'll just order some takeout.

146
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,100
Don't always order takeout.

147
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,460
Cooking at home is always better.

148
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,020
Take care of yourself and Jie when I'm away.

149
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,340
I'm hanging up now.

150
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,250
The stocks have risen. I'm selling them.

151
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,620
Mr. Wang,

152
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,580
what can I do for you?

153
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,810
I need to go on a business trip

154
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,850
to meet some important clients.

155
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,660
It'll take

156
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,300
about a month.

157
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,640
You'll handle the company affairs.

158
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,020
- Don't mess anything up.
- Got it.

159
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,020
Rest assured.

160
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,860
Let the finance give me 100,000 cash.

161
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,340
Understood.

162
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,720
Captain Xu! Captain Xu!

163
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,140
I saw it.

164
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,380
He is indeed wearing a wig.

165
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,580
Great job, Xiaoxing!

166
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,660
Keep an eye on him. Don't expose yourself.

167
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,780
Got it.

168
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,700
Just based on that movement,

169
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,710
can you confirm it's him?

170
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,300
(Zheng Jiong)

171
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,740
Zheng, go ahead.

172
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,620
Captain Xu,

173
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,060
he just made two phone calls.

174
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,940
One was to his home,

175
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,020
his wife answered it.

176
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,140
The other one

177
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,400
(Resident Registration Info)
was to a corporate legal person

178
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,180
named Zhao Zhengru.

179
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,660
Seems he's about to meet him.

180
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,780
Alright, got it.

181
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,040
Check more details about Zhao Zhengru.

182
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,540
Got it.

183
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,420
Understood.

184
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,450
Captain Xu, the target might be heading out.

185
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,820
Alright, copy that.

186
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,420
Dafei, the target has left.

187
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,300
Keep an eye on him.

188
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,060
Don't worry, I'm following.

189
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:48,980
Stay relaxed.

190
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,960
Just keep some distance.

191
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,140
Zheng, go ahead.

192
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,100
I find that Zhao Zhengru

193
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,260
had dealings with Wang Bingde's company.

194
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,980
And the projects from Zhao Zhengru's company

195
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,120
were all won by Wang Bingde.

196
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,980
The bidding success rate is abnormal.

197
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,700
(Winning party, bidding result)
Something's off.

198
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,260
Also, Wang Bingde is heading

199
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,540
to Zhao Zhengru's company.

200
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:30,780
Got it, Zheng.

201
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,500
Send the info to Dafei right away.

202
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,900
Got it.

00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,780
Is the photographer ready?

205
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,250
(Zhengru Real Estate)
Almost ready, Director.

206
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,460
When you're set, come out.

207
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,340
We're about to start.

208
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,820
Mr. Zhao, please take your seat.

209
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,390
Alright.

210

212
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,780
Welcome to our show,

CEO Talks Real Estate.

214
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,700
Today, we're excited to have

215
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,220
the Chairman of Zhengru Real Estate,

216
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,100
Mr. Zhao Zhengru.

217
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,060
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

218
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,940
Hello, Lei.

219
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,940
Thanks for having me.

220
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,020
Recently, our show's inbox

221
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,980
has been flooded with messages from viewers.

222
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,460
Everyone's curious to know,

223
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,300
as one of the city's biggest

224
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,540
real estate dealers,

225
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,700
how do you view the current property market?

226
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:10,820
Let me share my personal opinion.

227
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,060
First of all,

228
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,260
the era of real estate windfall profits

229
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,140
is coming to an end.

230
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,010
Based on past experiences

231
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,740
from developed nations,

232
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,500
a set of high-quality real estate

233
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,020
has a constant value of appreciation.

234
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,060
Similarly, in prime locations of cities

235
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,500
with a net inflow of population,

236
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,060
a high-quality house property

237
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,850
maintains its value.

238
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,210
Hello? Zheng.

239
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,340
Captain Xu,

240
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,260
I've found something.

241
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,460
Go ahead.

242
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,660
I found out that Wang Bingde

243
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,540
and his ex-wife's son Wang Yixuan

244
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,460
has already died.

245
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,380
What?

246
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,450
How did he die?

247
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,500
Three days ago, he was shot in the U.S.

248
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,980
It was during a home robbery.

249
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,420
But the scene indicated

250
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,700
he was using drugs at the time.

251
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,530
The consulate sent him a letter

252
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,260
two days ago.

253
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,180
Wang Bingde also sent a lawyer to the U.S.

254
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,050
to handle the funeral.

255
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,140
Anything else?

256
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,020
Nothing for now.

257
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,140
Zheng, let's do this.

258
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,730
Notify Immigration Inspection immediately

259
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:07,700
and check if Wang Bingde

260
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,900
has plans to leave the country.

261
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,800
Mr. Zhao, the shoot is all set.

262
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,270
(CEO Talks Real Estate)
You can get changed.

263
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,100
Alright.

264
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,380
I'll go change now.

265
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:29,540
- Please.
- Costume.

266
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,420
Okay.

267
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,340
Hello? Zheng.

268
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,060
The 17th floor is empty.

269
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,500
I think I lost him.

270
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,870
Check the location and see

271
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,520
if Wang Bingde is still in this building.

272
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,620

Did you find anything?

276
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,620
Not just yet.

277
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,500
Keep looking.

278
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,540
Got it.

What's going on, Zheng?

280

281
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,680
go check the 10th floor.

He entered the changing room.

326
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,540
He killed Zhao Zhengru

00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,010
and then left after changing clothes.

328
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,780
- Dafei.
- Too crowded to see him.

- What were you doing?
- Sorry.

332
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,120
But before that, he was in the building.

333
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,660
Wang Bingde must be avoiding cameras.

334
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,540

Yeah, but he didn't show up.

We checked all the cameras.

366

He likely escaped through the back road.

377
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,100
perfectly fine.

00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,660
any suspicious individuals?

380
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:03,940
No, not at all.

381
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,420
(Police tape)

382
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,300
Captain Xu.

383
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:10,940
Are there any witnesses?

384
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,300
No witnesses at the moment.

385
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,300
Captain Xu.

386
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,260
In such a transparent environment,

387
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,540
there's even a camera over there,

388
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:21,340
still no witnesses?

389
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,350
This is smart glass.

390
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,680
It was in off state at the time.

391
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,260
Let me show you.

392
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,660
Captain Xu, take a look at this.

393
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,780
The wound is very unusual.

394
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,460
What kind of weapon caused this?

395
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,420
A steel pipe?

396
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,420
But there's a gap in it.

397
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,420
No weapon was found nearby.

398
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,760
The murderer likely took it away.

399
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,700
Have you seen this weapon before?

400
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,060
A Luoyang shovel.

401
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,060
And this.

402
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,540
Officer Xu.

403
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,780
Hey, Chen Nan.

404
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,500
Can you come over

405
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:04,900
to find me right now?

406
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,140
I'm your consultant,

407
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,180
not your auxiliary officer.

408
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,620
I just sent you a photo.

409
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,780
Take a look first.

410
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,770
I need to check some records.

411
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:18,860
What happened?

412
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,020
Someone else was found dead.

413
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,740
It's pretty tricky this time.

414
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,420
(Scene Investigation)

415
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,420
Alright, check it first

416
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,500
and then get back to me.

417
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,380
Alright?

418
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,700
Zheng.

419
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,420
The phone signal disappeared nearby.

420
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,180
Search carefully. Don't miss any clues.

421
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,060
Alright.

422
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,360
There is a traffic camera

423
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,620
over there in the alley.

424
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,580
It's currently showing

425
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,210
the footage from the time of the incident.

426
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,180
Among these people,

427
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,210
Wang Bingde was not there.

428
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,300
No side alleys?

429
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,420
No back doors?

430
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,070
I walked the entire stretch of that road.

431
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:58,060
There are only two exits.

432
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,070
In the half hour after Wang Bingde left,

433
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,820
37 people passed by,

434
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,410
12 electric scooters,

435
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,300
three sedan cars,

436
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,180
and one taxi.

437
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,680
If you were Wang Bingde,

438
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,740
how would you do?

439
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,000
He didn't drive,

440
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:12,650
nor did he use his phone.

441
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,640
That taxi.

442
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,540
This footage.

443
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,620
Quickly.

444
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,980
(Southwest corner of the building)

445
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,270
Zoom in on the license plate.

446
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:23,140
(Southwest corner of the building)

447
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,340
Our team is all here.

448
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,020
No unfamiliar faces.

449
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,660
Captain Xu, the phone was found.

450
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,720
Can the data be recovered?

451
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,700
I'll do my best.

452
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,540
Thanks.

453
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,420
Officer.

454
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,780
Hello, I'm the legal director.

455
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,100
I want to talk to you about Mr. Zhao.

456
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,180
I think Mr. Zhao is one

457
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,460
of the best people in this world.

458
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,540
Loyal and compassionate.

459
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,180
Practicing vegetarianism
and worshipping Buddha.

460
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,860
You can ask anyone in the company.

461
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,140
Alright, just tell me

462
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,140
if Mr. Zhao knows

463
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,540
a man named Wang Bingde.

464
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,480
Do they have any grudges between them?

465
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,900
I'm not really sure about that.

466
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,020
Alright, thanks.

467
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,500
Captain Xu,

468
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,940
Wang Bingde most likely left in a taxi.

469
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,180
We've already located the driver

470
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,060
and brought her back.

471
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,580
Good, good.

472
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,780
Officer,

473
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:23,860
I think

474
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,110
I've seen this person before.

475
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,380
He's around 50 years old,

476
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,300
and

477
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,380
he was wearing all black at the time.

478
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,540
As for whether he wore a wig,

479
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,780
I'm not entirely sure.

480
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,780
He was wearing a hat though.

481
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,220
I really

482
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,100
didn't pay attention.

483
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,460
Where is his destination?

484
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,180
He got off at Daliang Village.

485
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:45,620
And then?

486
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,780
Then,

487
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:49,830
he seemed to take a motorbike.

488
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,660
I don't know after that.

489
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,380
Can you recall the motorbike driver?

490
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:55,120
He was quite tall.

491
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:57,180
A young guy,

492
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,580
average build,

493
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,180
with a big head,

494
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:01,860
dark skin,

495
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,050
and tiny eyes.

496
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,820
That's

497
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,100
what I remember.

498
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,140
If you come with us,

499
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,500
can you recognize him?

500
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:12,860
Probably.

501
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,220
Alright.

502
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,260
Let's go check it out.

503
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,140
Alright.

504
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,300
Let's move.

505
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,180
Thanks.

506
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:20,900
Come on.

507
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,220
Captain.

508
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,240
Winning and losing are part of the game.

509
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,420
Don't overthink it.

510
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,300
Got it.

511
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,660
Get ready,

512
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,540
we'll head out soon.

513
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:06,540
(Construction ahead. No entry.)

514
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,260
This guy's sneaky.

515
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,340
Another blind spot for cameras here.

516
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,820
Is he one of them?

517
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,380
It's him.

518
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,660
What's your name?

519
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,220
What do you mean?

520
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,460
What's it got to do with you?

521
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,100
Police.

522
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,460
Liu Shun.

523
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,340
My name is Liu Shun.

524
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:46,860
Look at this photo.

525
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,420
Does he look familiar?

526
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,420
Did you give him a ride?

527
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,400
Where did you take him?

528
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,980
I don't remember.

529
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,300
Let me tell you, this guy

530
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,020
is a murder suspect on the run.

531
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,500
If you can't explain here,

532
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,620
you'll need to come with us.

533
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,740
Liu Shun,

534
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,070
you're lucky to be alive.

535
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,540
Do you know you narrowly escaped?

536
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,350
The guy you gave a ride

537
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,420
is a murderer.

538
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,740
He's seen you.

539
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,660
Be careful, he might come back for you.

540
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,220
Officer,

541
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,340
I drove him

542
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,220
to the hidden canal,

543
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,540
and then he,

544
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,540
from here,

545
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,420
crawled inside.

546
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,360
How much did he pay you?

547
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,180
200.

548
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:04,900
Say that again.

549
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,540
2,000.

550
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,420
What else did he say?

551
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,940
He told me

552
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,380
that if anyone asks,

553
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,900
I should keep my mouth shut.

554
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,500
Sir,

555
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,460
the road's rough. Please hold steady.

556
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,900
He also told me not to take

557
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,240
any passengers for a few days.

558
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,020
Then he said

559
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,140
if I keep the secret,

560
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,030
he'll still look for me

561
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,220
after being back in a few days

562
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,480
and even give me 2,000.

563
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,160
Then why are you still waiting there?

564
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,500
Who would turn down money?

565
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,180
I just want to earn more.

566
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,460
Did he tell you when he'd be back?

567
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,380
No, he didn't.

568
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,500
Did you exchange phone numbers?

569
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:41,620
No, we didn't.

570
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,240
Is there anything else you're hiding?

571
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,220
No, nothing else.

572
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:45,910
Officer, I swear

573
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,500
I'm telling the truth.

574
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,500
I just checked around.

575
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,380
There's no cameras

576
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,360
within a few kilometers.

577
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,780
Moreover,

578
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,940
after leaving this cornfield,

579
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,300
one can run in the directions

580
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,660
of east, south, and west.

581
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,780
All rural roads.

582
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,920
And it's getting dark soon.

583
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,600
Call for help.

584
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,460
Search everywhere.

585
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,500
Got it.

586
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:26,930
- Here?
- That's right.

587
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,740
Alright.

588
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:30,620
That's okay?

589
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,620
Has it synced yet?

590
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,260
Yeah, you can see it now.

591
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,140
Alright.

592
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,060
Guo, we got it.

593
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,580
Officer Lin.

594
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,300
Lin.

595
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,180
How's it going?

596
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,380
Dafei is on it.

597
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:53,360
I'm back to check it out.

598
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,580
Are you okay?

599
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,780
Come on, let's look at this picture.

600
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,260
Captain Xu suspects

601
00:39:59,384 --> 00:40:00,736
it's caused by a Luoyang shovel.

602
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:01,970
I think it makes sense.

603
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,140
The internal structure of the wound shows

604
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,580
it is a specialized Luoyang shovel.

605
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,700
The head of the shovel

606
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,620
was modified from flat

607
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,500
to a pointed design.

608
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,140
One is the regular kind,

609
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,320
and one is the Guandong probe.

610
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:19,680
This specialized Luoyang shovel

611
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,420
first appeared in the Guandong relics world.

612
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,980
It's highly efficient for tomb raiding.

613
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,580
Those people from Zhouli Village

614
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,880
seem to use this tool too, right?

615
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,020
It could easily pierce someone through.

616
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,740
So, Wang Bingde

617
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:31,660
is likely connected to

618
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,500
Zhou Jiahei and Zhou Daye

619
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,780
from Zhouli Village.

620
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,530
Because this tomb-raiding gang's

621
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,500
iconic tool

622
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,220
is this special Luoyang shovel.

623
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,420
He can even kill with a Luoyang shovel.

624
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,420
Bet he's a tomb robber too.

625
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,420
Take a look at this.

626
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,260
It's a cicada pattern.

627
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,100
Wait, what cicada pattern?

628
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,260
A cicada.

629
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,420
A cicada?

630
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,300
In ancient culture,

631
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,580
people had a high level

632
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,100
of reverence

633
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,100
for cicadas.

634
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:04,940
Because cicadas

635
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,980
only drink tree sap and morning dew,

636
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,180
so ancient people saw them

637
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,100
as pure.

638
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,340
Plus,

639
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,300
cicadas transform underground,

640
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,620
then climb to the treetops,

641
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,140
becoming winged spirits.

642
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,300
In ancient times,

643
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,180
(The current image shows)
the cicada is a symbol

644
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,700
of ascension to immortality.

645
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:23,380
Many sacrificial tools,

646
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,580
and ritual objects,

647
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,620
including clothing,

648
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,820
often featured cicada patterns.

649
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,340
The tripod we excavated for rituals

650
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,100
also bears these cicada designs.

651
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,780
Even the tripod found at Zhou Daye's place.

652
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,830
They all have the pattern.

653
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,300
- Yeah.
- Plus,

654
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,180
this mark is scar tissue

655
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,340
that has healed after a burn.

656
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:40,900
It suggests

657
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,900
it was branded with a metal instrument.

658
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:44,820
I can't understand.

659
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:45,780
A tomb robber,

660
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:46,740
a renowned entrepreneur,

661
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,020
no connection between them?

662
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,760
Let's go to Wang Bingde's house.

663
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:53,540
Ms. Chen,

664
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:54,740
you come with me too.

665
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,460
Can I join?

666
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:58,660
Of course.

667
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,460
Sure, why not?

668
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,260
Alright, I'll grab my stuff.

669
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,100
Just go!

670
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,700
Come on!

671
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,060
