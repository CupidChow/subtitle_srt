00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.140
Hello?

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.180
Mr. Zhao?

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.780
Why did you get rid of Zhou Daye?

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.490
I had nothing to do with it.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.780
Zhou Wenhao doesn't have the guts.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.220
You must've been behind all this.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.020
Dead men are the safest.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.180
It benefits both of us.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.860
Are you mourning the old "prince"?

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.860
Do you think having the tortoise shell

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.700
means you can ditch me and go solo?

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.220
I don't have any tortoise shell.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.740
With your vast knowledge,

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.820
you can easily see there's

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.140
more than one piece of the shell.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.940
I don't care how many pieces there are.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.340
In ancient times,

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.180
methods were passed down

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.420
through both mental and physical techniques.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.900
The piece Zhou Daye has

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.540
is only about mental techniques.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.460
Young people these days

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.860
are without knowledge.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.300
I'll start work once notified.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:32.940
Mr. Chairman.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:12.740
Xu Xiao,

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:13.900
I found some new clues.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.940
I need to visit Yu County.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.340
What kind of clues?

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.660
Still in the evaluation stage.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.940
Not clear yet.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:22.780
Want me to go with you?

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.020
No need.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.660
I hope it helps your case.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:28.700
Wait for my update.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.260
Alright, sounds good.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:31.820
Bye.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.500
Captain Xu.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.940
Lin.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:46.820
Any new leads?

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:48.620
Not yet.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.740
I'll head back then.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:51.620
Sure.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.180
Captain Xu.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.500
What's this?

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.220
Files from Lin's case 10 years ago.

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:15.740
What about them?

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.060
It's related to Zhou Jiahei,

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.180
so I reviewed all the files.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.620
I found something odd.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:22.820
What's odd?

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.540
Lin said

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.420
there was just one female victim.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.020
Yes.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.220
Actually, there was another.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.900
Who?

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.940
No idea.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.060
It wasn't in the files.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.300
Not even the gender.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.460
Just glossed over.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.060
Anything else?

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.420
Also, Lin wasn't from our bureau.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.930
He was in a county criminal squad.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.820
After the case ten years ago,

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:46.780
he got transferred here.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.140
Alright.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.160
Put it in the archives.

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:54.300
I'll check it out later.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:57.300
I'll get back to work.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.900
Zhou Jiahei.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.420
Ten years ago,

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.420
Zhou Jiahei dismembered
and dumped bodies.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.120
And now, ten years later,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.860
his son

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.460
committed crimes using the same methods.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.500
And the way he did it

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.100
is closely tied to the mysterious rituals

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.820
of Ancient Yu Kingdom

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.620
that Chen Nan mentioned.

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.940
I think

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.380
someone out there is

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.660
pursuing forbidden occult for immortality.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:33.780
Zhou Jiahei.

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:54.300
Who?

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:56.380
It's me.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:57.500
Lin Guoqiang.

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.180
Lin, you…

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:01.900
What are you doing in the coffin?

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:03.300
Hurry up and get out.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.220
Come out.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:08.620
Be careful.

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.140
You're ridiculous.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:11.860
I wanted to view it

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.100
from the victim's perspective.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:16.980
Look at these nail marks.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:20.660
Truly, evil meets its match.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.660
You could've told me you were coming.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:24.260
I was just thinking,

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:26.740
if Zhou Wenhao

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:27.620
dies unexpectedly,

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.740
or fled abroad for 10 or 20 years.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:30.840
We can't wait that long.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.420
I wanted to ask you something.

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:36.660
About

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.140
the Zhou Jiahei case from ten years ago,

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.660
are there any details you left out?

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.500
Didn't I explain it to you before?

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:47.260
Yeah.

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:49.760
You said,

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:51.780
apart from Zhou Jiahei's suicide,

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:53.690
there was only one victim?

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:55.140
That's right.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.180
A college girl.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.540
That's not right. The file

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.500
mentions another victim.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:07.540
No identity provided.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.220
You were in charge of the case.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.500
You must've known.

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:20.260
Lin.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.740
We've been through thick and thin.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.500
We should at least be honest.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.580
No secrets between us.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:31.660
Chief Prosecutor Duan.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:33.550
What's your relationship?

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.060
Is he your father?

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:47.780
Why is your surname Xu

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:49.260
and not Duan?

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.660
Why do you sleep at the office
and not go home?

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.500
Why are you anti-marriage?

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:04.260
You investigated me?

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:07.380
I believe everyone has secrets

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.540
they don't want others to know.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.100
Am I right?

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.280
But if the secrets interfere with a case,

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:14.130
they can't be kept.

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:15.140
Mine don't interfere.

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:16.500
And I trust

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.660
yours don't either.

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:18.900
Right?

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:34.140
Guo, what's up?

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:35.740
Captain Xu,

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:37.140
we got the test results.

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:39.060
The meat pieces in the bag
are quite something.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.380
What are they?

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:43.260
Ziheche.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:45.740
Placenta.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:47.140
Human?

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:48.380
Yes, human.

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:49.660

I'll go to the community hospital.

I can send Dafei instead.

No, I'll go.

found out I work in OB/GYN,

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:01.380
so he asked me

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:04.020
if I could get that stuff.

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:06.100

Once a month, regularly.

Yes.

You're an associate.

You should've said so.

I didn't want to bother you,

Hello?

How long has it been?

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:20.220
Officer,

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:21.380
I know

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:22.900
this

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:23.780
isn't proper.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:26.380
It's been over a year.

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:30.380
What do you do

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:31.420
with it?

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:32.820
I'm getting older.

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:34.700
Take it as a supplement.

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:37.540
Take a look.

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:41.020
Is this the guy who introduced you?

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:45.380
Yes. Mr. Hu.

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:46.620
That's right.

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:48.540
You know the details well.

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:55.280
How long have you known him?

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:56.460
How did you two meet?

00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:58.740
Well,

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:00.580
three or four years, maybe.

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:02.700
Three or four years.

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:04.540
Where did you meet?

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:06.460
We met

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:08.660
at the Antique Street.

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:09.620
Be more specific.

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:12.140
Look,

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:14.060
I'm not very educated,

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:16.260
but I like to seem cultured.

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:18.700
I often go to Antique Street when I'm free.

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:20.620
He likes to wander there too.

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:21.940
We chatted

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:22.900
and became acquainted.

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:24.060
He sold me a few things.

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:26.120
I think he's knowledgeable.

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:27.660
What kind of things?

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:29.660
Well,

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:30.900
the bronze bell

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:32.060
and two vases at home.

00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:33.980
Does he have a shop there?

00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:36.940
I don't think so.

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:40.500
Do you know he runs a grocery?

00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:41.900
Selling seafood?

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:44.580
I had no idea about that.

00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:47.540
I just know he's into relics.

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:49.740
How often do you meet up?

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:51.460
Not often.

00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:54.540
Sometimes I ask him for advice.

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:57.020
He's interesting.

00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:57.900
He doesn't use WeChat.

00:30:58.340 --> 00:30:59.220
Only phone calls.

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:00.650
We haven't talked in half a year.

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:02.060
Do you two have business dealings?

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:03.020
Not at all.

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:04.860
I do landscaping projects.

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:06.540
We have no connection.

00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:08.580
I've heard something.

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:10.060
What did you hear?

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:13.380
Say it.

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:16.780
That guy's a mobster.

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:19.980
Don't know exactly which circle.

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:21.740
I've got a big business

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:23.340
and didn't want to get too close.

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:24.940
We just talk antiques.

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:26.820
Is he married?

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:28.340
Does he have kids?

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:29.540
Who are his usual friends?

00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:31.500
I'm not really sure.

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:32.660
We're just acquaintances.

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:34.020
What's in your cup?

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:36.060
Desert broomrape.

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:37.260
From Alashan.

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:38.260
I've got more. Want some?

00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:39.580
- No, no.
- Really refreshing.

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:40.820
- Don't.
- Perfect for you.

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:41.700
Sit down.

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:43.380
Just so you know,

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:45.740
trading placentas is illegal.

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:47.300
Plus, they might carry

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:48.540
viruses.

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:50.780
No way.

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:53.050
Pregnant women can infect too.

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:54.140
Think about it.

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:03.900
Let's go.

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:07.620
Take care.

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:09.940
Good day.

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:37.220
Trading placentas is illegal.

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:39.020
Plus, they might carry

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:40.060
viruses.

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:19.340
Wang's no decent guy,

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:21.140
but you were a bit harsh.

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:23.060
You probably scared him to death.

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:26.860
We've checked all places
tied to Zhou Daye.

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:29.020
None are the primary crime scene.

00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:30.940
I think

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:33.060
he had an accomplice.

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:35.540
But his contacts and finances

00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:36.620
are clean.

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:38.300
Hope this effort isn't wasted.

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:42.060
If he had accomplices,
they may strike again.

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.020
The victims might not just

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:45.540
be the few we've identified.

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:47.790
We can investigate

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:49.160
within similar groups of people.

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:50.900
Sounds feasible.

00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:53.700
I'll start organizing it.

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:01.020
- Hello?
- Hello.

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:02.020
Is this Captain Xu?

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:03.580
Who's calling?

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:05.300
(Police)
East Suburb Police Station, Yu County.

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:06.260
Someone's detained.

00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:07.400
She claims to be your friend.

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:09.180
Xu Xiao, get me out.

00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:10.060
Sit back down.

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:11.380
Sit back down.

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:12.540
What's going on?

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:14.980
Captain Xu, her name's Chen Nan.

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:16.160
Claims she's helping you.

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:17.580
You should come check.

00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:18.980
Alright.

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:19.860
I'm on my way.

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:20.900
Okay.

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:23.500
Officer, I'm not…

00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:32.620
Lin, about what we discussed earlier,

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:33.630
go back and set things up.

00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:34.860
Chen Nan's in trouble.

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:36.180
I gotta go to the police station.

00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:37.540
What about me?

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:40.460
Get out and head back
to organize the tasks.

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:42.580
Take a cab.

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:44.420
Go. Hurry.

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:45.700
This is not cool.

00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:46.580
Hurry.

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:03.220
Take a cab?

00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:04.580
Like there's one.

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:08.820
Gosh.

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:24.180
Placenta.

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:27.540
He was big on supplements.

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:29.460
(Wang Bingde)
This guy

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:30.340
has been in contact

00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:31.900
with Zhou Daye over the last four years.

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:33.380
I'm getting older.

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:34.580
Take it as a supplement.

00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:37.300
Good day.
