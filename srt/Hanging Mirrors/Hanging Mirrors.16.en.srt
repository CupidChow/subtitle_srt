3
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,380
Mr. Han.

4
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,450
You're still here?

5
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,100
I'm looking for some materials.

6
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,000
Let me know if you need anything.

7
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,060
Okay.

8
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,100
Go do your thing.

9
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,130
Mr. Han,

10
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,820
is now a good time to talk?

11
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,900
It's fine. Go ahead.

12
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,850
How's the collaboration
with the folks in India?

13
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,740
They are kind of unreliable.

14
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,620
It might take longer than expected.

15
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,780
What's up?

16
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,290
Well,

17
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,620
I've been studying
bronzeware's compartment.

18
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,700
So I was wondering

19
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,090
if you could give me some guidance.

20
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,180
That's a pretty niche topic.

21
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,900
I'm afraid I might not be able

22
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,700
to give you much help with that.

23
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,020
Look.

24
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,100
Why don't you

25
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,180
check some info yourself first?

26
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,900
I did check the info

27
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,970
and found out that

28
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,370
before now,

29
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,820
you were the one reading it.

30
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,580
So I thought I'd ask you.

31
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,780
Really?

32
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,380
You can find that out?

33
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,970
I wasn't trying to look into your records.

34
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,580
I just wanted to see

35
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,380
who shared the same interests as me.

36
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,140
Turns out, six months ago,

37
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,180
it was you who borrowed the book.

38
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,820
Guess I'm kind of lazy.

39
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,810
I thought I'd ask you.

40
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:34,900
No way.

41
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,580
I haven't been to the library in two years.

42
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,740
That can't be right.

43
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,180
Could it be a system error?

44
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,540
Yes.

45
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:46,820
Yeah. That's possible.

46
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,020
Okay.

47
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,180
Good luck with everything.

48
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,660
Bye-bye.

Doctor Hu.

56
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,060
What's his situation now?

57
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,370
His syncopal episode was brought on

58
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,820
by emotional agitation.

59
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,580
That was way too close.

60
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,620
Didn't I tell you last time

61
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,060
to keep a close eye on him?

62
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,460
He has high blood pressure

63
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,500
and can't afford to get worked up.

64
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,460
If it happens again,

65
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,380
he might have a stroke.

66
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,580
We will.

67
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,940
When will he wake up?

68
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,970
He woke up briefly earlier,

69
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,410
then fell back asleep.

70
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,380
That means it's not serious.

71
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,900
Let him rest for now.

72
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,290
He'll wake up naturally.

73
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,580
Once he wakes up,

74
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,500
he'll be fine.

75
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,350
Don't worry.

76
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,250
- Okay.
- Thank you.

77
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,180
Thank you.

78
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,250
- You heard the doctor, right?
- Yes.

79
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,100
It can't happen again.

80
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:58,980
It won't.

81
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,020
Don't worry about it.

82
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,460
- How is he?
- Not serious.

83
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,850
I'm here to check on Mr. Lin.

84
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,580
Thank you.

85
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,740
I have some

86
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:32,900
new findings,

87
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,460
but I'm unsure if I should say.

88
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,340
Go ahead.

89
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,740
I studied the replica of the tripod again.

90
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,340
I found the replica

91
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,500
is heavier than the original.

92
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,340
So, I consulted

93
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,340
a bronzeware

94
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,500
reproduction expert,

95
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,740
and he told me

96
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,500
the real one probably has
a hidden compartment inside.

97
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,380
You're still researching the tripod?

98
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,140
It's the key to the Immortality Ritual.

99
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,380
Of course, I'm researching it.

100
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,020
I even went to the library

101
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,260
and looked up some related materials.

102
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,060
The papers and materials

103
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,620
are obscure.

104
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,020
No one's read them

105
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,220
for a long time.

106
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,780
But six months ago,

107
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,770
someone borrowed them.

108
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,020
Who?

109
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,700
My advisor, Han Zhen.

110
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,780
He's a professional too.

111
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,290
There's nothing strange

112
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,700
about him reading that stuff.

113
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,180
That's true.

114
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,900
But when I asked him,

115
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,780
he denied it.

116
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,060
(Ward 9)
He said he never saw those papers,

117
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,580
and insisted it must be a namesake.

118
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,730
But I checked the library card.

119
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,050
It had his photo on it.

120
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,250
Also,

121
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,180
he recently

122
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,290
went abroad for research.

123
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,410
But when I called him that day,

124
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,340
I heard that song.

he took us there.

133
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,490
He even said

134
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,410

146
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,930
The songwriter

147
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,410
is Zhao Qian.

148
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:46,050
She owns this pub.

149
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,100
It's just one of her many businesses.

150
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,460
She's really capable.

151

Mr. Han's picks are classy.

152
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,050
Exactly.

153
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,890
Why would he lie to you?

154
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,010
You're his top PhD student.

155
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,180
That's what I'm wondering.

156
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,460
Mr. Han has many projects.

157
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:14,930
His research keeps him busy.

158
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,420
But why would he

159
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,980
dive into such a niche topic

160
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,260
like the compartment of bronzeware?

161
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,170
Your thesis

162
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,730
needs foreign references.

163
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,570
I remembered a detail.

164
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:26,850
He Xiang,

165
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,220
your thesis…

166
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,010
The data in your thesis

167
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:35,890
is…

168
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:37,810
Excuse me.

169
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:39,980
Hello?

(Immortality)

172
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,300
So, I was thinking…

173
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,370
He's like Wang Bingde

174
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,340
and Zhou Daye.

175
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,770
A successful professional.

176
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,420
Middle-aged.

177
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,460
Lin, you woke up.

178
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:58,610
I'm fine.

179
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:00,730
Are you alright?

180
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:01,930
You're suspecting Han Zhen?

181
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,370
That's bold.

182
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,300
Don't you want to graduate?

183
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,460
Of course, I do.

184
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,290
But it's of life and death.

185
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,250
Did Cui Haitao confess?

186
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,130
He told us everything.

187
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:14,650
So now you know it all.

188
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:16,410
Yes.

189
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,050
I want noodles.

190
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,050
Noodles? I made
soft-shelled turtle soup for you.

191
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,500
I want noodles.

192
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,100
Go make it.

193
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,650
Let's go buy some.

194
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:38,530
Go on.

195
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,490
Unbelievable.

196
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:42,370
Let's go.

197
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,300
Noodles?

198
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,180
Seriously?

199
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,570
Noodles for a southerner?

200
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:52,530
Wang Bingde

201
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,170
was the one that got away.

202
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,410
Yes.

203
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,010
Wang Bingde's

204
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,500
real name is Wang Xiang.

205
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,020
The underboss of Zhou Jiahei's gang.

206
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,900
Also the Master of Cui Haitao.

207
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,620
After Zhou Jiahei's death,

208
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,260
he fled with Zhou Daye.

209
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,260
That was my failure.

210
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,620
No, Lin.

211
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,980
Wang Bingde is

212
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,260
extremely cunning.

213
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,980
He's lived under aliases.

214
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,420
Zhou Jiahei hid him so well.

215
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,300
No one

216
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,180
could find him.

217
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,300
It's not your fault.

218
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,700
What else did Cui Haitao say?

219
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,060
He heard from Wang Bingde,

220
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,220
for the Immortality Ritual to succeed,

221
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,660
five young women need

222
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,380
to be sacrificed within 100 days.

223
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,250
A hundred days?

224
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,100
A hundred days…

225
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,580
Foundation Building.

226
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,380
Right. Cui Haitao used that term.

227
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,900
Ding Dang was the fifth victim.

228
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,260
But it didn't work.

229
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,580
With Wang Bingde's character,

230
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,300
he'll take another risk

231
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,380
- and go hunting again.
- Yes.

232
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,820
Now, he's gone

233
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,380
to Baoyang nearby.

234
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,380
I'll head over there soon

235
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,300
to coordinate things.

236
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,180
Don't worry, Lin,

237
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,700
this one that got away,

238
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,220
I'll take care of him for you.

239
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,420
Also, the info Chen Nan mentioned

240
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,460
is worth following up on.

241
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:01,900
I'll get Zheng Jiong over here.

242
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:03,820
I'm going.

243
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,900
No, no, no.

244
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,780
Lin.

245
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,660
Listen to me.

246
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,780
You can't get worked up again.

247
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,580
You're not alone now.

248
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,900
Better days are ahead.

249
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,140
If something happens to you,

250
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,060
someone will be upset.

251
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,300
Take it easy.

252
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,020
That's right.

253
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,820
Just chat it up for a bit.

254
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,420
I'm heading over there now.

255
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,260
Zheng Jiong,

256
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,800
look into where Professor Han has

257
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,780
been going

258
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,060
over the past three months.

259
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,780
Want to come along?

260
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,900
After our investigation,

261
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,020
over the past year,

262
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,820
he's often seen here often.

263
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,380
Even had his takeout

264
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,260
delivered here.

265
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,340
Are you sure it's this place?

266
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,220
Positive.

267
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,780
Who's the homeowner?

268
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,660
Zhao Qian.

269
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,060
What kind of person is he?

270
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,820
You don't know him?

271
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,530
Just a work relationship.

272
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,660
Not close.

273
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,540
He's quite scholarly.

274
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,340
Not interested in much else.

275
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,580
He's been divorced for years.

276
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,420
Always lived alone.

277
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,500
That's all I know.

278
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,020
Mr. Han.

279
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,580
Hello, Professor Han.

280
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,180
(Please Dispose of Trash Properly)

281
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,540
You're not welcome here.

282
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,540
Come in with me.

283
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:32,620
What's going on?

284
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,180
He left?

285
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,060
The clothes are here.

286
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,260
It's…

287
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,820
Seriously?

288
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,700
Come on.

289
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,180
Left without a word?

290
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,500
Hello?

291
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,460
Where are you?

292
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,660
You're still sick, alright?

293
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,820
Are you out of your mind?

294
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,420
You're almost 60.

295
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,300
You're not young like Xu Xiao.

296
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,420
If you pull this again,

297
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,540
I'm done with you.

298
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,580
Didn't you hear me?

299
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,380
A good friend.

300
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,140
- Okay.
- Did you hear me?

301
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,010
What good friend?

302
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:17,950
Who says we're friends?

303
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,140
Don't be mad, Ms. Zhang.

304
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,260
Listen to him. What a nerve.

305
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,420
Friends don't meddle like this.

306
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,420
Good Lord.

307
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,780
Mr. Lin.

308
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,660
Where are you?

309
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,180
You sure you're good with this?

310
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,660
I'm okay.

311
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,880
I can't just lie in bed all day.

312
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,780
Ms. Zhang made porridge for you.

313
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,860
Porridge's not good.

314
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,740
My blood sugar's high.

315
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,380
I used millet and brown rice.

316
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,820
Not white rice.

317
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,260
You must eat it.

318
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,060
Okay. Okay.

319
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,540
Are you staying here

320
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,180
or checking out?

321
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,060
I'm going home.

322
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,580
Why didn't you say so earlier?

323
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,820
I'll handle the discharge paperwork.

324
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,660
- I'll pack up.
- Pack things up.

325
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,420
Alright, Mr. Lin.

326
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,980
Don't worry. Ms. Zhang's got me.

327
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,580
We'll pack your stuff.

328
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,980
Stay safe.

329
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,380
- Okay.
- Hanging up.

330
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,220
Mr. Han,

331
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,620
when did you get back?

332
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,660
We had no idea.

333
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,420
Chen Nan,

334
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,060
are you my student

335
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,860
or a detective now?

336
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,260
I'll be straight with you.

337
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,020
I was just wondering—

338
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,260
did you borrow books from the library?

339
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,820
Do you dog-ear pages?

340
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,300
I've told you many times,

341
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,780
I haven't been to the library in ages.

342
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,060
Besides, look at this book.

343
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,260
Can I dog-ear it?

344
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,060
Plus, I've lost my library card.

345
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,300
Are you suspecting me?

346
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,340
You actually suspect me?

347
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,340
You've got some nerve,

348
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,660
Chen Nan.

349
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,660
Do you know who I am?

350
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,540
A national second-tier professor

351
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,300
and an archaeology expert.

352
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,300
You're suspecting me?

353
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,340
Do you think I'm like those

354
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,460
tomb robbers?

355
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,300
Mr. Han, don't be mad.

356
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,020
Didn't you tell me

357
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,620
to uncover the truth?

358
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,820
I just want to know

359
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,260
why have you come here

360
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,540
every night this past year?

361
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,660
You returned from abroad

362
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,060
without telling any of us.

363
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,300
You didn't even go home,

364
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,540
just came straight here.

365
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,540
Some things don't add up.

366
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,300
I'm just trying to figure it out,

367
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,180
Mr. Han.

368
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,140
What if I don't tell you?

369
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,580
Are you going to have the police officer

370
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,820
come arrest me?

371
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,620
That's outrageous!

372
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,660
Han,

373
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,380
calm down.

374
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,380
Just tell her.

375
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,100
I heard everything.

376
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,060
I don't want to live like this,

377
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,220
always hiding.

378
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,300
You're Chen Nan, right?

379
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,660
I'm Zhao Qian.

380
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,300
Mr. Han is my

381
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,580
friend.

382
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,820
He's been divorced for years.

383
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,980
I've also been single all along.

384
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,020
Out of respect for his child's feelings,

385
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,060
we never

386
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,820
made our relationship public.

387
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,500
Detective Chen,

388
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,420
are you satisfied now?

389
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,540
Sorry, Mr. Han.

390
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,540
Sorry, Ms. Zhao.

391
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,340
I'll get going now.

392
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,660
About us,

393
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,020
people will find out eventually.

394
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,300
How's it going?

395
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,220
Years of study down the drain.

396
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,220
Guess I won't be getting that PhD.

397
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,420
Don't worry.

398
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,740
I got your back.

399
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,980
Can you help me with my thesis?

400
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,500
That's beyond my expertise.

401
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,300
Get in the car.

402
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,580
Mr. Han's innocent.

403
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,060
This is his friend's place.

404
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,660
Xiaoyu,

405
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,020
how have you been lately?

406
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,300
Busy with work?

407
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:36,900
That's good.

408
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,300
I'm doing fine here.

409
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,660
Don't worry.

410
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,820
You're so annoying,

411
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:44,900
Lin Guoqiang.

412
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,740
If you pull this again,

413
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,740
I'm done with you.

414
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,500
(Dad)

415
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:31,420
(Dad)

416
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,620
Dad,

417
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,220
why are you back so late?

418
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,380
I wanted to show you my drawing.

419
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,820
I want to spend time with you too,

420
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,020
but my job means

421
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,820
I can't be with you every day.

422
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,220
Because there are others out there

423
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,020
who need me to protect them.

424
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,100
You're my hero.

425
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,580
You'll keep us safe, right?

426
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,580
I will.

427
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,940
Measurement starting.

428
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,220
Please stay still and silent.

429
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,140
Don't move.

430
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,420
- Can't move during the test.
- Okay.

431
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,580
Alright.

432
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,940
Captain Xu Xiao called,

433
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,380
said you need to rest.

434
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:35,940
I'm fine.

435
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,900
Measurement complete.

436
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,620
Systolic 119.

437
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,620
Diastolic 98.

438
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,900
119

439
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,940
over 98.

440
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,820
Is that high?

441
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,700
It's fine.

442
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,500
Here.

443
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,380
I'll get your meds.

444
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,940
Who called you yesterday?

445
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,020
Xiaoyu.

446
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,220
What did she want?

447
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,500
Just girl talk.

448
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,020
What's she doing now?

449
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,420
Working at a clothing store.

450
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,180
She said

451
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,580
after her shift,

452
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,900
she wants to grab dinner.

453
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,900
Can I go?

454
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,300
Don't be too late.

455
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,620
Remember to take this later.

456
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,900
You must wait 4 hours between doses.

457
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,300
Got it.

458
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,540
Professor Han.

459
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,780
Hello, Professor Han.

460
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,460
Welcome back, Professor Han.

461
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,500
Where's Chen Nan?

462
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,380
In the grave pit.

463
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,100
All of you, come over.

464
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,620
When I'm not around,

465
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,940
where do your brains go?

466
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,940
What is all this mess?

467
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,220
Kong Lingwei,

468
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,620
how many times have I told you

469
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,900
to use foreign references

470
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,260
in your thesis?

471
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,580
Where are your references?

472
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,220
I put them at the end.

473
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,100
Why didn't you cite them properly?

474
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,100
He Xiang,

475
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,700
you did the data analysis yourself, right?

476
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,380
Why must you cite others?

477
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:04,500
Have a little academic confidence.

478
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,220
And the rest of you,

479
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,940
take your work.

480
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,060
Rewrite it.

481
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,220
Rewrite everything.

482
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,700
Here's some good news.

483
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,300
The excavation project for the Tomb

484
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,020
of Marquis Donghai of Western Han

485
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,300
has been approved.

486
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,540
I'll be leading it.

487
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,460
Dismissed.

488
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,460
Take the junk away.

489
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,300
Why are you still standing there?

490
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,500
Mr. Han,

491
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,020
here's some water.

492
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,380
Mr. Han,

493
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,220
please don't be upset.

494
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,460
If the others were

495
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,100
half as thoughtful as you,

496
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,020
I wouldn't be this upset.

497
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,500
Chen Nan is straightforward.

498
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,020
If she overstepped,

499
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,340
please don't take it to heart.

500
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,780
Alright. Enough.

501
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,260
You can leave now.

502
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,340
Okay.

503
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,100
He Xiang.

504
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,620
Hello?

505
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,620
I know.

506
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,700
I'll talk to the kids.

507
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,740
I'm sure they'll

508
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,380
understand and support us.

509
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,020
Yes.

510
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,900
You've had it rough these years.

511
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,180
It's my fault.

512
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,740
I should've handled this sooner.

513
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,060
I apologize to you,

514
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:15,940
okay?

515
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,180
You actually suspect me?

516
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,380
Just tell her.

517
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,860
I don't want to live like this,

518
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,380
always hiding.

519
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,420
Besides, look at this book.

520
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,700
Can I dog-ear it?

521
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,620
Alright.

522
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,500
I promise you.

523
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,620
Okay.

524
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:14,940
(Qi's Secret Garden)

525
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,700
What's wrong?

526
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,100
Got something on your mind?

527
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,380
Nothing much.

528
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,660
How have you been?

529
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,300
Same old, same old.

530
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,300
Just getting by.

531
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,780
Didn't you say

532
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,100
you found a job

533
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,900
at a clothing store?

534
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,380
How's it going?

535
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,100
Don't even ask.
I'm on my feet all day.

536
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,260
Toiling away for pocket change.

537
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,340
But it's better than before.

538
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,820
Crawling out of the mud,

539
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,820
we have to look forward.

540
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,260
For people like us,

541
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,860
we're quite lucky.

542
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,260
Come on.

543
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,060
Cheers.

544
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,180
Have they found the murderer?

545
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,500
It's alright.

546
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,500
That officer's looking out for you.

547
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,660
What's there to be scared of?

548
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,900
So,

549
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,820
what's your next plan?

550
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,540
I haven't decided yet.

551
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:25,780
Well,

552
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,860
are you settling in okay?

553
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,620
Mr. Lin's been kind to me.

554
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:31,660
But,

555
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,660
I still want to find something

556
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,780
I can do myself.

557
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,500
Living at someone else's place,

558
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,740
I need to find my own value.

559
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,820
That's the spirit.

560
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,340
We need to rely on ourselves

561
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,220
to make it in life.

562
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,140
Don't overthink it. Cheers.

563
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,180
Cheers.

Hello, 110 Emergency Center.

578
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,420
Hello?

579
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,300
Can you hear me?

580
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,580
Yes. Go ahead.

581
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,500
I think I saw the man on the APB.

582
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:43,180
(Police)

583
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:55,260
Officer,

584
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,420
right in there.

585
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,100
Get ready to arrest.

586
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,340
What?

587
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,460
Why wear shades indoors at night?

588
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,580
My eyes are sensitive to light.

589
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:26,980
Is that a problem?

590
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,500
Hey, Cap.

591
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,020
We checked. Not him.

592
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,460
When are you coming back?

593
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:18,380
(Almost done eating. Be back soon.)

594
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,460
Captain Xu, have some water.

595
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,500
Thanks.

596
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,700
APB's sent to all locations.

597
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,740
None were missed.

598
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,140
We'll hear something soon.

599
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,620
Seriously,

600
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,100
how did Wang Bingde just vanish

601
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,180
after that gas station?

602
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,420
It's like finding a needle in a haystack.

603
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,100
He'll definitely

604
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:11,980
go hunt again.

605
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:13,980
He sure will.

606
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,340
Hello?

607
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,380
Hello, Captain Xu.

608
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,940
Officer Li, what's up?

609
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,100
What've you been up to?

610
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,980
Swamped with a tricky case.

611
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,260
Go ahead.

612
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,340
What's up?

613
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,420
Do you know someone named Chen Nan?

614
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,820
Yes, why?

615
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:35,980
Well,

616
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,540
she got into a fight over a cat.

617
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:38,700
She's here at our station.

618
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,460
Could you come over?

619
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,860
Sure.

620
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,230
- I'll head over now.
- Alright.

621
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,300
Get out of the car.

622
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,580
I need to take care of something.

623
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,380
- Sure.
- Sure.

624
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,260
I left the food I got for you here.

625
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,140
Okay.

626
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,420
Drive safely.

627
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,300
It's getting late.

628
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:53,660
I'll come pick you up.

629
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,420
Don't worry, Mr. Lin.

630
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,980
I'm walking Xiaoyu back.
Be right back.

631
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:00,940
Let me walk you home.

632
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,660
It's nothing.

633
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,780
Let's go.

634
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:14,820
My place is close.

635
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:15,980
This is fine for me. Thank you.

636
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,980
Alright. I'm heading back.

637
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:18,860
Stay safe.

638
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:19,780
Bye.

639
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:20,660
See you.

640
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:21,820
Bye.

641
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,340
Mr. Lin,

642
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,820
I'm on my way home now.

643
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:32,940
Don't worry.

644
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,420
Xiaoyu, where are you?

645
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,220
I'm home.
