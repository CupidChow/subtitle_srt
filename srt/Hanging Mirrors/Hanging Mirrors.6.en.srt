=Episode 6=

3
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,360
Do you think Shen Chao

4
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,000
doesn't know anything?

5
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,210
Impossible.

6
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,970
He's definitely hiding something.

7
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,720
He'd rather serve longer time

8
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,130
than give us any clues.

9
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,760
I think

10
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,610
there's something

11
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,970
scarier than jail in his mind.

12
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,840
We should start with his contacts.

13
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:05,770
Xu Xiao.

14
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:06,650
- Sir.
- Check out

15
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,890
- Here.
- his calls and chats.

16
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,570
Commissioner Cao is here to see you.

17
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:10,730
- Sir.
- Hello, everyone.

18
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:11,730
Hello, sir.

19
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:12,650
Thank you all.

20
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,570
It's an honor to have you guiding us.

21
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,730
I wouldn't say guiding.

22
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,290
With your capable team here,

23
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,170
I feel assured.

24
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,770
We're here today to boost morale.

25
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:20,810
Right, Director Yang?

26
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,580
We appreciate it.

27
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,820
Commissioner Cao heard
of your case's progress

28
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,900
and made a visit today.

29
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,540
Yes, there has been progress,

30
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,620
but at the same time,

31
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,180
new challenges have emerged.

32
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,940
There's a suspect

33
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,820
who might hold info

34
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,500
(Suspect Zhou Daming)
crucial to the case,

35
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,580
yet he's not cooperating.

36
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,620
So we're meeting to discuss strategies.

37
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,170
Xiaoxing, give an introduction.

38
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,740
Laosan's

39
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,420
real name is Shen Chao. A core member

40
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,540
of Zhou Daming's grave-robbing gang.

41
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,300
His main role was to handle

42
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,220
explosives for tomb entry.

43
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,860
He likely learned this skill

44
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,380
from his early mining work.

45
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,340
We're still tracking

46
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,380
the explosive's origin.

47
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,700
We noticed

48
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,740
Shen Chao

49
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,680
is addicted to gambling,

50
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,740
but strangely,

51
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,860
he has no gambling debts.

52
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,460
We suspect

53
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,820
he bets in small amounts.

54
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,380
According to call records,

55
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,140
besides Zhou and other gamblers,

56
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,540
the person he contacts most

57
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,060
is Du Lanlan.

58
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,620
This is her.

59
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,540
32 years old,

60
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,940
single mother of a 4-year-old,

61
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,300
running a small leather shop.

62
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,460
Shen Chao and Du Lanlan

63
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,810
must have an unusual relationship.

64
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,100
Over the past few years,

65
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,180
there were frequent transfers between them.

66
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,420
The biggest was two years ago.

67
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,620
Shen Chao transferred her
500,000 yuan in one go.

68
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,940
She later opened her leather store.

69
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,860
Could Du Lanlan be the key

70
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,500
to cracking this case?

71
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,780
We hope so.

72
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,940
I'm planning to visit her tomorrow.

73
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,140
I'll come with you.

74
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,540
No need, Lin.

75
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,460
I've got this.

76
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,060
Shen Chao's unwilling to talk.

77
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,030
Looks like he's trying

78
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,480
to take the fall himself.

79
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,540
Let me be clear.

80
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,460
This could get him

81
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,900
in serious trouble.

82
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,860
He's not from Zhouli Village.

83
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,420
No need to go down with those

84
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,580
tomb raiders.

85
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,420
If he confesses,

86
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,380
he might get

87
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,780
a reduced sentence

88
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,940
and get out sooner.

89
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,560
We're not married.

90
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,720
What happens to him

91
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:08,420
is not my concern.

92
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,740
It took the plate away.

93
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,160
Is that your son?

94
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,820
What a pretty boy.

95
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,700
Nice kid.

96
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,620
A bright future is

97
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,620
waiting for him.

98
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,060
Imagine him

99
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,740
graduating college,

100
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,180
wearing his cap and gown.

101
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,980
You'll get

102
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,180
a family photo

103
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,300
on campus.

104
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,940
A brand-new life begins.

105
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,780
How wonderful.

106
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,380
Can I visit him?

107
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,220
Number three.

108
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,900
Go ahead.

109
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,940
Dad, why are you in there?

110
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,620
When are you coming home?

111
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,740
I miss you.

112
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,620
Good boy.

113
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,060
I'll be home soon.

114
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,860
Dad, your yellow vest looks funny.

115
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,220
Take him back.

116
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,380
(Interrogation Room)
Captain Xu.

117
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,620
That guy's a tough nut.

118
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:05,980
Will this tactic work?

119
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,380
Worth a try, right?

120
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,820
Captain Xu.

121
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,340
They visited?

122
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,820
Yes.

123
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,340
You must

124
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:27,980
guarantee

125
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,620
my family's safety.

126
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,740
I can guarantee that.

127
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,780
Only if you cooperate.

128
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,340
I will.

129
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,380
I didn't set the explosives.

130
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,380
I had no grudge against Zhou Daming.

131
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,740
For many years,

132
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,220
he's treated me well.

133
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,700
I've worked at the mine for years.

134
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,580
I'm careful with explosives.

135
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,340
The explosive was

136
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,580
definitely planted

137
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,740
ahead of time.

138
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,340
I don't know

139
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,340
how it was triggered.

140
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,140
The reason I didn't tell you

141
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,060
is because

142
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,940
that was too brutal.

143
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,940
I'm afraid of getting involved.

144
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,660
In your line of work,

145
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,460
who else

146
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,660
knows this skill?

147
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,580
Probably

148
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,660
no more than five people.

149
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,940
If you want their names,

150
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,060
I can tell you all of them.

151
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,060
But they're all street names.

152
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:30,420
I don't know

153
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,660
their real names.

154
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,300
Did Zhou Daming

155
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,700
have enemies?

156
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,420
Yeah.

157
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,500
Quite a few.

158
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,940
He gambled,

159
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,220
got into fights,

160
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,580
sometimes

161
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,060
even harassed widows

162
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,860
when he was drunk.

163
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,700
Anyone

164
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,000
particularly strange

165
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,740
in his circle?

166
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,220
When you say strange,

167
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,740
what do you mean?

168
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,460
How strange?

169
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,460
Someone who gives you a feeling,

170
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:08,940
something's off.

171
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,060
Like when you see them,

172
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,700
you feel they

173
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,780
really like

174
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,140
superstitions.

175
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,420
Into Feng Shui and that.

176
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,340
Know anyone like that?

177
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,340
Yes.

178
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,380
There is one.

179
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,220
Who?

180
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,020
That person is

181
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,380
Zhou's handler.

182
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,780
But

183
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,260
I've never met him.

184
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,980
I don't know his name.

185
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:35,900
Once,

186
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,500
Zhou called him.

187
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,700
I felt

188
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,460
Zhou was very respectful.

189
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,060
On the phone,

190
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,660
he called him Boss.

191
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,300
Another time,

192
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,540
I had dinner with Zhou.

193
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,460
He drank too much

194
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,340
and told us,

195
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,420
his boss

196
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,380
was quite mysterious.

197
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,620
How?

198
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,780
The Boss

199
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,020
has a coffin

200
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,580
in his bedroom.

201
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,500
He finds it

202
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,660
pretty good

203
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,500
and sleeps in there every night.

204
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,620
Says it

205
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,620
helps his health.

206
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,180
When did Zhou Daming and the Boss

207
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,660
last talk?

208
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,580
Do you

209
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,580
remember?

210
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,780
No idea.

211
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,420
But

212
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,900
the day we went down into the tomb,

213
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,380
after our meeting,

214
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,660
Zhou said he had to meet the Boss first.

215
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,660
Because that tomb

216
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,500
was pointed out by the Boss.

217
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,140
Does the Boss know explosives?

218
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,460
Zhou said

219
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,700
he was an expert.

220
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:48,190
How did he get there?

221
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,300
I drove him.

222
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,700
Remember the address?

223
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,500
1206.

224
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,060
Kuilin Community.

225
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,380
Based on Shen Chao's confession,

226
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,620
we checked the surveillance from that day.

227
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,660
They indeed stopped

228
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,500
in front of Building 1206.

229
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,100
Hey, Captain.

230
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,140
How did you know

231
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,380
Du Lanlan could make him talk?

232
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,260
She's two years older,

233
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,300
divorced,

234
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,160
and has a kid.

235
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,300
But since early this year,

236
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,560
they've been tying up the lines.

237
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:26,500
Why?

238
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,300
Mistress?

239
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:29,980
True love.

240
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,980
What's one's biggest weakness?

241
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:35,910
The biggest…

242
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,140
Kids are our biggest weakness.

243
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,500
What do you mean, Lin?

244
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,660
You'll understand once you have one.

245
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,340
This is the place.

246
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,500
1206.

247
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,720
It has Room 1206?

248
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,380
Room 206, Building One.

249
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,320
Alright.

250
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:30,740
Find the property manager

251
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,860
and get the resident info.

252
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:33,980
Lin, let's go up.

253
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:40,380
Uh…

254
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,780
Is there a manager here?

255
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,300
There must be.

256
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,820
It's a proper complex.

257
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,740
Look around.

258
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:06,980
Over here.

259
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,300
Lin.

260
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,100
Lin.

261
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,540
What's that smell?

262
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,620
Seems like window caulk.

263
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,940
Let me.

264
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,020
No need.

265
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,740
(Monkfruit, Astragalus, Tai Bai Hua)

266
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,340
("Ancient Prose Anthology")

267
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,300
All done?

268
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,220
Yeah.

269
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,740
Three, two,

270
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,700
one.

271
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,220
We've met him, right?

272
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,620
I'm Hu Xiaomin.

273
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,620
(Fresh Every Day)

274
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,820
(Hu Xiaomin)
I run a grocery store.

275
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,380
We get some frozen chicken and eggs

276
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,180
from him monthly.

277
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,020
Hu Xiaomin?

278
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,460
That's right.

279
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,820
Hu Xiaomin.

280
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,780
You guys go ahead.

281
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,700
I'm leaving now.

282
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,140
How could it be him?

283
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,860
Where was it found?

284
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,580
Under Zhou Daming's pillow.

285
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,620
Captain Xu,

286
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,100
hit on the head from a bottle,

287
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:14,980
but it wasn't fatal.

288
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,810
He was dragged into the coffin
and suffocated.

289
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,300
There's caulking glue in his mouth.

290
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,020
Estimated time of death is

291
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,990
two to three days ago.

292
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,360
Broken glass near the coffee table

293
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,660
matches his head wound.

294
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,150
It should be the primary scene.

295
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,020
The coffin was sealed

296
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,220
by common window caulk.

297
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,140
25 yuan per tube at any market.

298
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,580
Fingerprints?

299
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,180
Several sets were collected.

300
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,860
Both victim's and Zhou Daming's.

301
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,470
Fingerprints on the bottle too.

302
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:36,630
We need to check

303
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,700
for any criminal records.

304
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,020
Captain Xu,

305
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,620
there's something burned in the coffin.

306
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:43,660
Probably

307
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,620
to consume oxygen faster

308
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,140
and ensure his death.

309
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,220
If we had arrived sooner.

310
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,620
How many were involved?

311
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,860
Judging by the footprints,

312
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,710
it seems one person

313
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,860
around 175 cm tall,

314
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,780
a male.

315
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,340
Xiaoxing.

316
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,140
Check his call records

317
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,660
over recent days.

318
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,700
Identify every number.

319
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,620
Get all the residents out.

320
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,130
Have Laosan identify them one by one.

321
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,060
Alright.

322
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,020
Focus on males around 175cm tall.

323
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,620
- Okay.
- Go.

324
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,660
- I'm going too.
- Sure.

325
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,580
Alright.

326
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,780
Captain Xu.

327
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,740
Mr. Lin,

328
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,620
this place is hard to find.

329
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,380
I asked her to come.

330
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,460
She's an expert.

331
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,380
We don't get it, but she does.

332
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,380
Check out the patterns.

333
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,780
Don't touch it.

334
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,140
The patterns are Ming dynasty imitations.

335
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,100
The replica's well-made.

336
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,300
It…

337
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,220
What?

338
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,420
You've been to burial pits,

339
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,500
but you're scared of this?

340
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,380
I was looking at bones,

341
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,860
not the deceased.

342
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,620
Why is this person

343
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,940
dead inside the coffin?

344
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,460
Good question.

345
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,020
Why did he die in the coffin?

346
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,540
Someone could enter easily

347
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,140
and attack with a bottle.

348
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,970
Must be someone familiar.

349
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,860
Carried the window caulk

350
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,540
means he came prepared.

351
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,540
He planned to seal him in the coffin.

352
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,140
But

353
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,180
why killed him this way?

354
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,860
Some kind of ritual?

355
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,140
Was it

356
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,100
to punish him

357
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,020
and torment him?

358
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:52,020
Look, his face is terrifying,

359
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,140
and he's suffocated inside.

360
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,380
Just like Zhou Daming.

361
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,020
Suffocated to death.

362
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,300
Maybe it was

363
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,420
to avenge Zhou Daming.

364
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,460
Maybe

365
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,620
an accomplice.

366
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,260
Silencing witnesses.

367
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,540
Think about Hu Xiaomin.

368
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,020
You ran into him that night.

369
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,380
He must be eliminated.

370
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:47,980
Zheng.

371
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,220
Captain Xu.

372
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,140
Check this out.

373
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,220
Alright.

374
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,460
A lacquered box.

375
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,380
Gold-inlaid.

376
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,900
What is this thing?

377
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,620
An ancient makeup box.

378
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:02,980
Obtained

379
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,420
on Guiyi Day,

380
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,660
Yimao Month,

381
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,540
Guiwei Year…

382
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,460
Si.

383
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,780
Look carefully.

384
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,140
That character is Si.

385
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,540
Night of Guisi Day.

386
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,860
Song Dynasty Tomb in Ma'an Village,

387
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:18,980
Jin Province.

388
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,220
Obtained

389
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,860
on Guiyou Day,

390
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,140
Dingyou Month,

391
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,660
Xinsi Year.

392
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,860
Night.

393
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,660
Ming Dynasty Tomb

394
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,780
in Sunjia Village,

395
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,620
Ji Province.

396
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:37,300
Xinsi Year is 2001.

397
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,740
Guiwei Year is 2003.

398
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,660
Is it a tooth?

399
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,060
Looks like one.

400
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,620
An ancient piece.

401
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,820
Different ancient tombs,

402
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,740
different teeth.

403
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,340
Could this person also be a tomb robber?

404
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,460
Every time he rob a tomb,

405
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,660
he kept a tooth as a souvenir?

406
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,300
Chen Nan, help me check.

407
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,380
Any from ten years ago?

408
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,700
On Renchen Day,

409
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,460
Bingyin Month,

410
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,860
Sichou Year.

411
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,460
Yu Kingdom Tomb

412
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,220
in Hedong Village, Yu County.

413
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,900
February 2009.

414
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,180
Zhou Jiahei committed crime

415
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,660
that October.

416
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,900
If this was unearthed

417
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,260
from the Yu Kingdom Tomb,

418
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,540
then, it should be

419
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,700
from the Monarch?

420
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,060
The Monarch's remains

421
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,380
lack a few teeth for sure.

422
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,780
Can I borrow it

423
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,660
for comparison?

424
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,300
Sure, just remember to return it.

425
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,380
Seems this person looted

426
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,680
the Ancient Yu Kingdom Tomb.

427
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,220
But what's the connection

428
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,300
to Zhou Jiahei's case?

429
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,620
Here's a possibility.

430
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,660
He raided the ancient tomb

431
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,820
and took the tortoise shell

432
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,380
recording the Immortality Ritual.

433
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,020
Method of immortality…

434
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,300
Recorded in the shell.

435
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,540
Then,

436
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,020
following its instructions…

437
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,130
He completed the ritual
by dumping bodies.

438
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,700
But was caught by Lin.

439
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,860
Police.

440
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,060
Freeze!

441
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,540
Drop the tool.

442
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,780
Then he framed that clueless

443
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,140
Zhou Daming.

444
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,380
Did you know Zhou Daming
was involved in tomb raiding?

445
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,500
I have no idea.

446
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:43,720
Officer, if you find him,

447
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,100
tell him to give my money back.

448
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,660
Help me check.

449
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,140
Where is the first tooth?

450
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,380
Obtained on Bingzi Day,

451
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,380
Guimao Month,

452
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,740
Dingchou Year.

453
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,820
Zhou Tomb

454
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,660
in Likou Village,

455
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,940
Nanhe Town,

456
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:44,980
E Province.

457
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,520
So this was in 1997.

458
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,460
That's not right. Hu Xiaomin looks like,

459
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:53,100
he's just over 30.

460
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,100
Back in 1997,

461
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,020
he was still a kid.

462
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,620
Must've had a teacher.

463
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,740
Who taught him?

464
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,140
Captain Xu, check out the lower layer.

465
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,980
What was kept here before?

466
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,660
Left such deep marks.

467
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,100
Zheng.

468
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,080
What do you think it is?

469
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,500
Can't tell.

470
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,180
("Oracle Bone Script Dictionary")

471
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,780
What for?

472
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,700
For my research.

473
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,580
Lin.

474
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:17,980
Are you okay?

475
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,180
I'm fine.

476
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,340
Who's in this photo?

477
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,780
Zhou Jiahei.

478
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,700
Zhou Jiahei?

479
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,220
The main culprit in the case ten years ago?

480
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,380
Zhou Daming is his nephew.

481
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,860
And Hu Xiaomin had a photo of him.

482
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,370
Stay here. I'm going to Zhouli Village.

483
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,260
Wait till I'm done. I'll go with you.

484
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,060
No need. Get someone to take me.

485
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:45,980
I can do it.

486
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:47,940
You?

487
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,300
Let's go.

488
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,060
Stay safe.

489
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,180
(Tablet of Zhou Ancestors)

490
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,220
Zhou Jiahei had a son,

491
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,140
right?

492
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,340
Officer,

493
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,860
this is the clan's ancestral hall.

494
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,460
Even as a public official,

495
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,380
you can't just...

496
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,660
Please.

497
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,860
Let me ask you,

498
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,240
why isn't Zhou Jiahei's son

499
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,660
in the family genealogy?

500
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,940
Why is Zhou Jiahei's page

501
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,460
of different color?

502
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,620

(Zhou Jiahei)

505
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,780
Was it replaced by someone?

506
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:26,860
Who did it?

507
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,040
What else are you hiding?

508
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,820
Officer,

509
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,220
let's sit down

510
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,820
and talk this through.

511
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,180
Alright?

512
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,620
Please.

513
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,180
Please.

514
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,340
Have a seat.

515
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,740
Tea?

516
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,580
No, thank you.

517
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,500
No need.

518
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,420

520
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:26,980
Hello?

521
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,300
Captain Xu.

522
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,980
It's mealtime. Join us?

523
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,780
- Bring something back for me?
- Sure.

524
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,900
Zheng, leave me the camera.

525
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,100
Alright. Got it.

526
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,020
Okay.

527
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,780
- Anything's fine.
- Okay.

528
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,780
Heading out.

529
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,700
Alright.

530
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,860
Zhou Jiahei's son

531
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,700
was likely illegitimate.

532
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,860
He and Zhou Daming grew up together.

533
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,060
One was slow,

534
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,300
kept tomb-robbing.

535
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,300
The other, clever,

536
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,610
became the boss behind the scenes.

537
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,780
Am I right?

538
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,860
If the person protecting him

539
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:16,980
had spoken the truth earlier,

540
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,820
he wouldn't have died.

541
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,460
Who's this?

542
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,580
Hu Xiaomin.

543
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,540
Maybe he had another name.

544
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,660
I know he was Zhou Jiahei's son.

545
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,820
Small-time grocer.

546
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,260
Big-time artifact boss.

547
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,420
What else are you hiding?

548
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:49,740
Who killed him?

549
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,180
You should ask yourself.

550
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:58,980
Zhou Daming

551
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,740
was blown up in the tomb.

552
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,460
The next day,

553
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,740
Zhou Jiahei's son

554
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,140
was suffocated in a coffin.

555
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,740
The dead are gone.

556
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,100
Karma.

557
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,460
Retribution.

558
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,740
Let it go.

559
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,620
Officer,

560
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,620
please hear me out.

561
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,180
Jiahei's father

562
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,700
and I

563
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,620
were like brothers.

564
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,100
When I was 55,

565
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,460
my son fell seriously ill.

566
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,180
But

567
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,980
I had no money.

568
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,140
Jiahei had

569
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,340
made his fortune

570
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,580
and saved my son's life.

571
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,820
He only asked me

572
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,060
to erase his illegitimate son's name

573
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,740
from the family

575
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,100

576
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,460
Except for me,

577
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,060
no one knew

578
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,740
about his illegitimate son.

579
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,300
In household registration,

580
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,180
there was

581
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,940
no official

582
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,900

relationship

584
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,500
on record.

585
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,260
Thinking back now,

586
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:33,420
he must've known early on

587
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,180
that something would happen.

588
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,060
So he left his son

589
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,340
a backup plan.

590
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,060
Sure enough,

591
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,980
he died shortly after,

592
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:49,220
leaving everything he had,

593
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,260
including his shady dealings

594
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,540
all together

595
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:56,220
to this son.

596
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,140
That's him.

597
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,060
What's his real name?

598
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,900
Zhou Daye.

599
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,740
Same generation as Zhou Daming.

600
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,020
They're both dead.

601
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,620
Jiahei's bloodline

602
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,940
is cut off.

603
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,020
You two,

604
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,500
each pick an item and appraise it.

605
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,140
Whoever gets it wrong,

606
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,540
kneels for two hours.

607
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,260
I'll go first.

608
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:49,100
Blue and white lotus patterned gourd bottle.

609
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,100
The motif says it's from Chenghua period,

610
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,020
Ming dynasty.

611
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,180
Religious item,

612
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,620
used by Taoist priests for pills.

613
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,220
But this is a replica.

614
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,020
Worth only a few thousand.

615
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:01,900
Not bad.

616
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,140
Daming.

617
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,300
Your turn.

618
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,500
Judging from the shape,

619
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,700
it's Warring States…

620
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,420
Qin…

621
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:21,820
Han.

622
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:22,900
A Han sword.

623
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,020
The inscription reads…

624
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,700
King Goujian of Yue

625
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,500
made this sword for personal use.

626
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:30,900
Correct.

627
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,660
Goujian.

628
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,300
What Goujian?

629
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,660
Does Goujian have any connection to the Han?

630
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:43,980
Kneel.

631
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,020
Kneel!

632
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,780
Daye,

633
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:53,980
go to sleep.

634
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:21,420
(Spirit Tablet of King Wu of Wei)

635
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,180
Rite complete.

636
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,620
Next.

637
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,740
Zhou Daming.

638
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,420
Salute the Founder.

639
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,180
Salute the Leader.

640
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,460
Rite complete.

641
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,220
Next.

642
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,220
Zhou Wenhao.

643
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,300
Salute the Leader.
