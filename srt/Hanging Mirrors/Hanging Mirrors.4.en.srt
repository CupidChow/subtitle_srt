3
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,280
Turn it around.

4
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,130
Slowly, be careful.

5
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,400
Careful now.

6
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,720
Got it.

7
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,720
Watch out.

8
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,840
Xiaoxing,

9
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,760
check its engine number.

10
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,360
No security screw caps on the plate.

11
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,720
I think it's cloned.

12
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,050
On a junker like this?

13
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,050
Draws less attention. Go check.

14
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:15,970
Alright.

15
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,600
Here, the engine number.

16
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,280
The front.

17
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,290
That veteran turns 60 today.

18
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,250
We didn't even get him a birthday gift.

19
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,930
It's his birthday?

20
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,250
Well,

21
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,960
everyone's been too busy lately.

22
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,930
He'll probably understand.

23
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,850
If only I had trusted him earlier

24
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,290
and given him more support…

25
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,960
Do you think sometimes I can be

26
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,370
pretty annoying?

27
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:54,450
Yeah.

28
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,050
No.

29
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:56,970
No.

30
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:57,960
I mean, your job

31
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,680
is to question everything, right?

32
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,170
Plus, leading a team is stressful.

33
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,810
We're all used to it.

34
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,400
I'm talking about the gift.

35
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,170
A gift?

36
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,320
- My dad…
- Forget it.

37
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,770
It's pointless. I'll ask Xiaoxing.

38
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,050
Yeah. Ask Xiaoxing.

39
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:13,970
Right.

40
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:16,570
Captain Xu.

41
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,930
Female, around 20.

42
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:23,970
Four limbs

43
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:24,890
and head.

44
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,250
The torso's missing.

45
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,610
Same method as before.

46
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,650
It was soaked.

47
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,010
Not looking good.

48
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,010
Captain Xu,

49
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,130
we found it.

50
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,770
The owner had reported it stolen.

51
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:45,860
Here's the system record.

52
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,020
(Case Filing Form)

53
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,250
Imagine how heartbroken her dad must be.

54
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,410
Maybe her dad

55
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:24,490
didn't even care about her.

56
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,080
You've never been a dad,

57
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,250
so you don't know how it feels.

58
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,080
Raising a daughter is different
from raising a son.

59
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:32,650
Daughters are gentler.

60
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,460
The way they look at you

61
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,490
is something other women don't have.

62
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,400
They only see the good in you.

63
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,320
Hey,

64
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,250
we found the car owner.

65
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,880
He filed a report.

66
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,930
It's in the system.

67
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,150
Dafei and I will go talk to him tomorrow.

68
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,480
I'll go with you.

69
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,600
Okay, stop.

70
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,560
The guy who reported it lives here.

71
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,400
Zhang Haiyang?

72
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,280
Captain Xu, he's here.

73
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:49,890
Looks busy.

74
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,530
Hello, Mr. Li.

75
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,560
Have you

76
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,480
found my van?

77
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,050
We're working on it.

78
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,320
These two officers

79
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,580
came specifically for this case.

80
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,210
Your van's been missing for over 10 days?

81
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,530
Exactly.

82
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,600
About two weeks.

83
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,930
Where did you park it?

84
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,160
Right at the entrance.

85
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,920
Which entrance exactly?

86
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,040
Show us?

87
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:20,890
Over there.

88
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,360
I left it right here.

89
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,370
Who are

90
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,290
these guys?

91
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,520
Major Crimes Unit.

92
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,320
Listen.

93
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,800
Your van's caught up in a big case.

94
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,210
That's why they're here.

95
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,210
When was the bike left here?

96
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,040
It's been here

97
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,210
for a few days.

98
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,800
Can't really remember.

99
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,850
Feels like it's been here for a while.

100
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:27,840
Zheng,

101
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,760
check this shared bike for me.

102
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,720
I need to know

103
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,080
who last used it.

104
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,000
Thanks.

105
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,130
Any surveillance in the village?

106
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,050
Yes.

107
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,560
But the cameras are off.

108
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,680
They haven't been fixed yet.

109
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,680
Did you lend your van to someone?

110
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,540
I didn't.

111
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,330
Just bought it secondhand.
Still precious.

112
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,840
Captain Xu, I found it.

113
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,080
The person

114
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,250
who used this shared bike

115
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,250
is Li Mingyi.

116
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,250
Sent you

117
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,520
all the details.

118
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,280
Do you know Li Mingyi?

119
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,560
I do.

120
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,520
He's my brother-in-law.

121
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,360
Where does he live?

122
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,600
I'll take you there.

123
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,920
This is Li Mingyi's house.

124
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,330
The door's locked. No one's home.

125
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,000
He lives alone?

126
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,920
Yes.

127
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,840
Just him.

128
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,480
That's Li Mingyi.

129
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,600
Mingyi.

130
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,480
Lin, split up.

131
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:41,570
Don't move.

132
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,010
Why are you arresting me?

133
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,010
No questions.

134
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,720
Come with me and you'll see. Get up!

135
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,370
You sure can run.

136
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:53,690
Get up.

137
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:54,810
Move.

138
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:01,330
Behave.

139
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,720
Hello?

140
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,050
Hello?

141
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:11,970
Officer Xu.

142
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,400
I got some new discoveries.

143
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,720
Tell me more.

144
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,130
You'd better come to the site.

145
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,250
I'm in the middle of an arrest.

146
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,370
Can I get back to you later?

147
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,560
Alright, I'll wait.

148
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,480
Bye.

149
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:44,210
Start talking.

150
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,070
How did you steal the van?

151
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:47,210
Who did you sell it to?

152
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,520
Be specific.

153
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,050
Steal the van?

154
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,290
I didn't.

155
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,290
It's on record.

156
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:02,410
We've confirmed it.

157
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,640
You gonna talk, or do we

158
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,410
have to pull it out of you?

159
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,640
Okay.

160
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:10,530
Two days ago,

161
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:12,160
I got tempted

162
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:13,490
and went big.

163
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:14,570
I lost five grand.

164
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,410
If you keep that up,

165
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:17,730
we won't waste time.

166
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,040
I got a cellmate for you.

167
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,490
Fang Biao,

168
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:21,450
aka Black Tiger.

169
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,450
Heard he's a self-taught financial guru.

170
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,210
Beat cop said

171
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,090
you owe him quite a bit.

172
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,290
Perfect. Acquaintance.

173
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,570
Keep each other company.

174
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:36,370
Wait, wait.

175
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,290
I...

176
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,520
Okay.

177
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,880
I'll talk.

178
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,000
Last December,

179
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,610
I stole

180
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:48,930
an Elysion.

181
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,160
In February came, I was broke.

182
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,610
So I stole a Lexus.

183
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,160
A Ruifeng in March.

184
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,760
And,

185
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:00,850
a GAC…

186
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,850
A GAC business van.

187
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:05,930
That's all.

188
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,000
That's it?

189
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,090
You're lying.

190
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:10,650
Officer,

191
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,290
even if you throw me in with Black Tiger,

192
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,410
I've said all.

193
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:14,330
What did you do

194
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:15,690
two weeks ago?

195
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,490
Nothing.

196
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,370
Just stayed home.

197
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,970
You even steal from family?

198
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,160
What do you mean?

199
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,490
Two weeks ago,

200
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:28,450
you rode a shared bike

201
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:29,850
to Zhang Haiyang's house.

202
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,290
Brother-in-law?

203
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,080
Speak.

204
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,960
Who'd you sell it to?

205
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,890
Officer,

206
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:48,770
even if I'm a thief,

207
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,130
I'd never steal from my sister.

208
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,970
Shared bikes have usage logs.

209
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,860
(Li Mingyi)

210
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,490
I rode a bike to my sister's house,

211
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,600
that's not against the law.

212
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,970
Your record lines up

213
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,970
with the van theft date.

214
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:02,750
Your brother-in-law says

215
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,570
you never came by that day.

216
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,090
Officer,

217
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,330
I confessed everything I did.

218
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:09,730
For things I didn't do,

219
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,170
I really don't know.

220
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,330
Stop denying it.

221
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,490
We found the car already.

222
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,050
Officer.

223
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,290
I swear, I didn't do it.

224
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,610
Stop asking me about it.

225
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,680
I'll ask you one last time.

226
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,800
Have you seen this van?

227
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,210
Have you

228
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,280
caught Daming?

229
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,210
Tell us about him.

230
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,200
What's his name?

231
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,370
You tricked me.

232
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,050
Li Mingyi, you still don't know

233
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,370
how serious this is?

234
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,320
This isn't just about theft anymore.

235
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,000
Do you know how many years you'll face?

236
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,640
Kid,

237
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,160
you seem pretty smart.

238
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,650
Go back to school

239
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:26,680
and turn your life around.

240
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,000
You're not like them.

241
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,640
Or it'll be

242
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,970
20 years in jail.

243
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,490
Is that worth it?

244
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,520
What had he done

245
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,290
with that van?

246
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,040
Tell us his name.

247
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:46,810
Zhou Daming.

248
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,650
Captain Xu,

249
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,770
third victim's identity confirmed.

250
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,050
The three victims,

251
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,500
one was a nightclub hostess,

252
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,990
and the other two found gigs online.

253
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,560
They didn't know each other.

254
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,560
Their workplaces

255
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,160
and residences differ.

256
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,200
Dozens of kilometers apart.

257
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:19,920
What about info and cash flow?

258
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,400
No unusual cash flow.

259
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,560
As for info flow,

260
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,450
just family, friends, and colleagues.

261
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,680
We've investigated all of them.

262
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,290
Nothing suspicious.

263
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,210
So, based on what we know,

264
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,920
they had no direct connection.

265
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,290
But we can't rule out

266
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,060
the possibility of in-person interactions.

267
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,170
What about the clients?

268
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:38,810
That's a key focus.

269
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:40,690
Well,

270
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:42,610
they used non-verified accounts,

271
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:43,970
and each was deactivated

272
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,690
after being used for a while.

273
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,050
Their new accounts

274
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,960
had new names and avatars.

275
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,250
So,

276
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,050
it's hard for us to track the data.

277
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,120
We cross-referenced

278
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,600
(Victim An Qi's contacts)
the contacts of all three victims,

279
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,210
and only two people

280
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,050
overlapped.

281
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,200
Both female, both coworkers.

282
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,290
But still,

283
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,490
(He Qing)
nothing suspicious.

284
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:04,810
That's all we have for now.

285
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,860
(Debit Card Transaction Record)

286
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,850
The suspect is extremely cautious.

287
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,200
Once these women are killed,

288
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,050
all traces are completely erased.

289
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,210
(Victim Info)
It's as if they never existed

290
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,350
(Zhang Yin, An Qi, Shen Meng)
in this world.

291
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,690
These women share some common traits.

292
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:23,610
Have you noticed?

293
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,690
From the photos,

294
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:26,770
they're all attractive.

295
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,690
Their height is also similar.

296
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,810
You might try profiling the killer.

297
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,970
(Zhang Yin, An Qi, Shen Meng)

298
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:33,930
In my opinion,

299
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:34,970
two types of people

300
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,240
would be drawn to this type.

301
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,560
First,

302
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:40,050
those craving control

303
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,560
they lack,

304
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,290
maybe even being controlled themselves;

305
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:44,890
Second,

306
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,480
those under extreme stress

307
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:47,650
who need an outlet.

308
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,160
These women all have

309
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,530
a calming look,

310
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:52,610
which might

311
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,050
make the killer feel powerful.

312
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,640
Could be a group too.

313
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,080
Try checking the victims'

314
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,970
social circles

315
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,050
from this perspective.

316
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:02,890
Yes, sir.

317
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:14,610
Hello, Ms. Chen.

318
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,800
Captain Xu,

319
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:17,920
you have such a loose grasp on time.

320
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,480
You're so busy,

321
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,200
and I have to go with your schedule?

322
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,320
Like I've got

323
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,730
nothing going on, right?

324
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:26,970
You said you'd call,

325
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,240
and I've been waiting.

326
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,960
Wasn't it for your case?

327
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,000
My apologies, Ms. Chen.

328
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,490
The thing is,

329
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,640
we're truly swamped.

330
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:37,850
Alright?

331
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,810
I can't be perfectly on time.

332
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,490
Don't you think that's a bit much?

333
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,410
How about this?

334
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,320
Just go ahead with your work.

335
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,800
Fine. Whatever.

336
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,000
Captain Xu.

337
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,390
Zhou Daming's identity is confirmed.

338
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:02,890
He's a tomb raider.

339
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,810
He served time for tomb raiding.

340
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,830
After getting out, he went right back to it.

341
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,110
I say we arrest him immediately.

342
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:09,610
Why?

343
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,000
Trust me.

344
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,170
He's a tomb raider.

345
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:13,700
His name is Zhou Daming.

346
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,720
Surname's Zhou.

347
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,090
I suspect this is a group crime now.

348
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,720
We need to monitor him first,

349
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,200
then catch them all in one go.

350
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,920
Delays complicate things.

351
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,300
I suggest an arrest.

352
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,840
Listen to me, Lin. Stay calm.

353
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,800
We must stay calm.

354
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,720
Dafei.

355
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,720
Set up perimeter surveillance on him.

356
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,970
Don't alert him.

357
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:33,890
Keep me posted.

358
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,410
- Okay.
- And you?

359
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,480
I'll go meet Ms. Chen.

360
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:39,950
You say he's a tomb raider?

361
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,220
Ancient tombs might be involved.

362
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,810
She just snapped at me on the phone.

363
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,080
Let's go together.

364
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,210
Go by yourself.

365
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,560
Dafei, let's go

366
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:47,560
set up.

367
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,800
Get the surveillance equipment.

368
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:49,810
Come on. Let's go.

369
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,720
Okay.

370
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:54,880
Take measurements here.

371
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,650
- Help me log it.
- Got it.

372
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,200
Be careful with this one.

373
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,480
Scan it.

374
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:04,610
I'll help you.

375
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,760
Alright.

376
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,290
Sorry, Ms. Chen.

377
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,400
My apologies.

378
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,770
Sorry again for the wait.

379
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,880
I brought everyone coffee.

380
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:15,370
Sorry about that.

381
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,410
Really sorry.

382
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,080
Kong.

383
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:26,650
Kong.

384
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:28,650
Coming.

385
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,010
Captain Xu brought coffee.

386
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:32,400
- Thanks, Captain Xu.
- Thanks.

387
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,320
Thank you.

388
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:34,930
You don't want some?

389
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,130
Where's Officer Lin?

390
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:40,690
He, uh…

391
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:41,610
He has other duties.

392
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,160
Last time,

393
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,770
Officer Lin gave me a lot of hints.

394
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,130
So I re-examined the bamboo slips.

395
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:53,850
Take a look.

396
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,130
Dispel evil.

397
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,680
What does it mean?

398
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,010
To dispel evil resentment.

399
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,010
Why on earth

400
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,530
would they do that?

401
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,560
What we want to know

402
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,480
is the motive.

403
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,680
Take a look at this.

404
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,210
Through

405
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,240
the eyes

406
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,400
of

407
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,320
the living.

408
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:22,610
Now I'm totally lost.

409
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,130
In Yin-Yang principles,

410
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,610
Yin corrodes Yang,

411
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,240
or Yin consumes Yang.

412
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,720
Below that,
immortality and enduring vision.

413
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,320
His motivation

414
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,640
could be immortality.

415
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,010
Killing others to achieve it?

416
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:44,680
Do you think

417
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,600
the suspect is after the same thing?

418
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,810
Immortality is

419
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,010
humanity's

420
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,010
eternal obsession.

421
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,040
Look at this.

422
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:00,770
Method of…

423
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:01,770
Recorded in…

424
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,120
We think it says,

425
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,250
"Method of immortality,

426
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,290
recorded in the shell."

427
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:07,890
Come on.

428
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,240
Over here.

429
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,010
Look at his left hand.

430
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:17,930
According to our analysis,

431
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:18,880
his left hand

432
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,130
was likely holding a tortoise shell.

433
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,930
Back then,

434
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:24,770
tortoise shells were used for divination

435
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:25,720
and for recording.

436
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,250
So the tortoise shell might've

437
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,570
had the immortality method

438
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,040
inscribed?

439
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,800
Where is it?

440
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,400
Taken by tomb raiders.

441
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,530
Isn't it also recorded on the bamboo slips?

442
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:45,570
The bamboo slips

443
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:46,970
only recorded

444
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,250
some general details.

445
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,720
But the ritual procedures

446
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,810
were carved on the tortoise shell.

447
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:54,530
That's why it was so precious.

448
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,250
When this Monarch died,

449
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,960
he held onto it tightly in his hand.

450
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,050
- Hello?
- Captain Xu,

451
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,440
tech team just called.

452
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,810
They say Zhou Daming might act tonight.

453
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,330
Not sure what he's planning.

454
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,090
He was speaking in code. We didn't get it.

455
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,370
I've sent you the location.

456
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:16,660
Alright, got it.

457
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,010
Okay, um…

458
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:21,930
You go ahead.

459
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,040
By the way,

460
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,610
just a thought.

461
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,320
Even if that Monarch

462
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,440
did have the immortality method,

463
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,800
he probably never got to use it.

464
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,840
Because his sons probably

465
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,160
wanted him gone so they'd

466
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,080
take the throne sooner.

467
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,080
Just wild speculation.

468
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,000
Never mind.

469
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,210
Kong.

470
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,160
Get me a coffee.

471
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,050
I'm done dividing it up.

472
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,080
Come take a look.

473
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,050
The Immortality Ritual?

474
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,000
Captain.

475
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,760
They're coming out.

476
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:02,810
The one in the middle.

477
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,160
Does he look like the guy attacked you?

478
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,090
The height and figure match.

479
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,050
A lefty.

480
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,780
You said he's left-handed?

481
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:20,720
He attacked me with his left hand.

482
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,570
His weight was on his right foot.

483
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,400
When counting money, right hand holds,

484
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,320
left hand counts.

485
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:27,840
That's our guy.

486
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,410
Dafei, play the recording.

487
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:31,410
Captain.

488
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:34,450
Play it.

489
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:36,530
Laosan, we work tonight.

490
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,120
Dibs on the loot in a flaming tomb.

491
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,050
Bring all your jingling gear.

492
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,120
Got it, bro.

493
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,330
Don't worry. It's all good.

494
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:43,970
How can I not worry?

495
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,960
Mess it up, and you'll regret it.

496
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,760
The loot

497
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,920
means going grave-robbing.

498
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,240
A flaming tomb

499
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,960
refers to a valuable grave.

500
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,560
Dibs

501
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,810
means a grave no one's dug yet.

502
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,050
Bring a few more people over.

503
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:02,010
We are

504
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,010
monitoring him,

505
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:03,930
not making an arrest.

506
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:05,640
The grave rats are ruthless.

507
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:06,920
Better to be cautious.

508
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,560
Dafei,

509
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:11,070
get one more guy to join us.

510
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:12,800
Got it.

511
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,720
Lin,

512
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,920
I just met with Ms. Chen.

513
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,720
She agrees with your

514
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:20,410
Yin-Yang theory.

515
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,840
The motive might be absorbing Yin energy

516
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,760
for immortality.

517
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,730
They documented it on a tortoise shell,

518
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,570
which the king of the Ancient Yu Kingdom

519
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,050
took to his tomb as a burial item.

520
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:37,650
They're moving.

521
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:39,520
Dafei, you go in my car.

522
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:46,800
Dafei,

523
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,360
keep an eye on that small truck.

524
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,280
Copy that.

525
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,370
Let's move.

526
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,480
Laosan.

527
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,640
I'll head down.

528
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,640
Stay here and keep watch.

529
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,160
- Okay.
- Tug it if there's trouble.

530
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,640
I'll tug three times.

531
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:33,930
Don't worry, Daming.

532
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,530
It's all under control. Totally safe.

533
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,960
Go ahead. It's fine.

534
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,480
Keep a close watch.

535
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:39,640
Relax. No problem.

536
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,560
Come down with me.

537
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,560
Sure thing.

538
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,760
- Let's go.
- Come on.

539
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,370
Let's go.

540
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,120
Take it slow.

541
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,040
All good?

542
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,130
Yeah. Totally.

543
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,200
I suggest we act now.

544
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,320
Catch them red-handed.

545
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:17,650
Lin,

546
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,640
we're not here for relic crimes.

547
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,770
We're solving a murder case.

548
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:25,130
Daming, go ahead.

549
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,320
Don't worry.

550
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,680
It's perfectly safe.

551
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:30,520
- Hand me the basket.
- Here.

552
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,120
Stay sharp.

553
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,610
Relax. It'll be fine.

554
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:38,680
Judging by the rope length,

555
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,810
it's at least 20 meters deep.

556
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,160
I think it's time to act.

557
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,530
We discussed this,

558
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:44,450
Lin.

559
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:49,480
Straighten the rope.

560
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:54,090
You two, slow down.

561
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,000
Feels odd.

562
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:02,720
I've got a bad feeling.

563
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,120
Get them!

564
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,040
Lin.

565
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,800
Police! Don't move!

566
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:15,410
Go get him!

567
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,290
Be careful.

568
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,720
Stop it.

569
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:38,930
Stop.

570
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,130
I'm warning you. Stop.

571
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:58,450
Stop! Drop it!

572
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,450
Get him in the truck.

573
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:10,470
The rest, secure the road.

574
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,200
- Don't move.
- I didn't do anything.

575
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:22,720
I'm just the driver.

576
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:29,530
Lin.

577
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,450
Lin.

578
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,690
What are you doing?

579
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:33,610
He's a tomb raider.

580
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,040
Surname's Zhou.

581
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:36,120
Arrest him immediately.

582
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,090
Arrest him

583
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,210
immediately.

584
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:41,850
Can you dig it out like that?

585
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,450
Excavator. Go get it.

586
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:44,770
Go get an excavator!

587
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:48,050
This is crazy. Stop digging.

588
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:50,010
Hey, stop digging. Stop it.

589
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,440
Get an excavator!

590
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:56,320
Are you hiding something from me?

591
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,310
I want to solve the case.

592
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,760
Get it?

593
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:00,370
I must solve this case!

594
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:22,650
Don't move.

595
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:26,450
Captain.

596
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:29,690
Behave.

597
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:34,410
Have some water.

598
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:55,770
What's wrong with Lin?

599
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:57,210
Obsessed?

600
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:00,950
When will the excavator

601
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,850
get here?

602
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,210
On the way.

603
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:05,370
But if we use the excavator,

604
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,240
the man underneath might not survive.

605
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,200
Keep your head down.

606
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,680
What are you trying to say?

607
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,160
Stop wriggling.

608
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,560
I have a friend with excavators.

609
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,850
- I'll call him now.
- No need.

610
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:36,480
Shut up and stay put.

611
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,890
I really don't know anything.

612
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:56,970
I did set the explosives.

613
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,010
But they went off.

614
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:01,640
I've done this for years without issues.

615
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:02,930
Besides,

616
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:04,490
why would I kill Zhou Daming?

617
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,000
Why?

618
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,800
We'd like to know that too.

619
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,410
We looked into it.

620
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:11,330
These two cups

621
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:12,410
are quite valuable.

622
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,280
You handle explosives.

623
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,860
(Resident Registration Info)
Could it be that

624
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:16,970
you're eying these cups?

625
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,810
You blew people up down there

626
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:19,890
to make them yours, right?

627
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:20,890
I have no idea.

628
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,490
Maybe

629
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:24,160
one of the fuses failed.

630
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,970
But what triggered the explosion

631
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:27,410
after Zhou went down…

632
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:28,930
I really don't know.

633
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:30,490
Don't try anything.

634
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,890
You're now suspected of murder

635
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:33,840
and grave robbing.

636
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,410
Multiple crimes, you get that?

637
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,660
Did Zhou Daming have enemies?

638
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,000
No idea.

639
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,600
- Does he have a handler?
- No clue.

640
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,000
What about the driver keeping watch?

641
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,370
He's just some random guy

642
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:45,410
we found in the village.

643
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:46,680
Knows even less than I do.

644
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:50,930
Shen Chao.

645
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:53,490
Do you know how many years

646
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:55,880
you'll face if all these charges

647
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:57,610
against you are proven?

648
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:59,050
Zhou is already dead.

649
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:00,840
However long you want to sentence me,

650
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:02,410
I deserve it.

651
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,720
Sentence me however you like.

652
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:05,970
I don't care.

653
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:08,890
You may not care,

654
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,790
but what about your family?

655
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:12,450
Your parents?

656
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,490
Wife? Kids?

657
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:15,570
Do they not care either?

658
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,240
My parents died long ago.

659
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:18,810
I…

660
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,050
don't have a wife or kids.
