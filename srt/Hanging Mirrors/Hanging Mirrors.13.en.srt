=Episode 13=

3
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,100
Today we're here

4
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,060
to learn about Wang Bingde's situation.

5
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,580
My client has a neuropathic headache.

6
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,260
She needs to rest.

7
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,280
I know

8
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,350
citizens have an obligation

9
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,540
to cooperate with the police.

10
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,540
Mrs. Wang,

11
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,660
can we take a look around?

12
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,420
Do you...

13
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,540
Do you have

14
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,420
a search warrant?

15
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:37,580
(Search warrant from Shuoyang City
People's Court)

16
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,220
Alright, that's fine.

17
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,180
Let them look around.

18
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,540
Alright.

19
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,260
Let's go, Chen Nan.

20
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,820
Do you know this person?

21
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,580
Any disputes with your husband?

22
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,340
Zheng, I'll send you a photo.

23
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,660
Check all the owner information

24
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,340
of the phone numbers

25
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,620
listed above.

26
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:35,900
Officer,

27
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,100
let me clarify something.

28
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,420
Wang Bingde

29
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,060
is no longer my client's husband.

30
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,020
They divorced six months ago.

31
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,580
So,

32
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,820
whatever Wang Bingde does

33
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,120
has nothing to do with my client.

34
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,140
Are you sure?

35
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,620
He left here this morning.

36
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,020
Wang Bingde has been living here.

37
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,820
He refused to leave my client's home.

38
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,380
What could we do about it?

39
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,220
According to our investigation,

40
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,500
after your divorce,

41
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,080
most of Wang Bingde's cash

42
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,680
(Debit card transaction record)
was transferred to your account.

43
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,260
Four overseas properties

44
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,580
are all under your name and the child's.

45
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,700
Officer,

46
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,700
please don't make baseless assumptions.

47
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,180
We've been keeping an eye on Wang Bingde.

48
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,720
Don't think divorce makes the assets safe.

49
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,220
As for illegal income,

50
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,100
even you are divorced,

51
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,260
we can still take action.

52
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,100
Everything about Wang Bingde

53
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,380
has nothing to do with me anymore.

54
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,340
If you

55
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,820
can prove any illegal income,

56
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,180
you're free

57
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,340
to handle it through legal procedures.

58
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,580
That's fine.

59
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,220
Mrs. Wang.

60
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,180
This saw has no distinct smell.

61
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,030
It's unlikely to be the weapon.

62
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,500
It is probably used

63
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,060
for smashing these phones.

64
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:12,780
Makes sense.

65
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,660
Officer,

66
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,260
what does this prove?

67
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,700
It proves Wang Bingde

68
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,600
has strong counter-surveillance abilities.

69
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,540
I don't get it.

70
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,540
Just a few SIM cards,

71
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,460
and some phones?

72
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,780
These are

73
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,740
non-real-name unregistered cards.

74
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,660
Wang Bingde used them

75
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,700
to contact his accomplices.

76
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,560
They agreed to make a call

77
00:06:31,584 --> 00:06:32,796
in every three days.

78
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,220
His accomplices likely have

79
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,260
the same calendar.

80
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,500
When the scheduled time comes,

81
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,420
they'll insert the cards and dial.

82
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,060
They use non-smart phones to make calls

83
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,420
and then destroy them immediately.

84
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,620
Mrs. Wang,

85
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,940
if he hasn't done anything shady,

86
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,670
do you think this is necessary?

87
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,100
If he committed murder, you'd arrest him,

88
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,960
but this doesn't prove anything.

89
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,060
What are you saying?

90
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,380
You might not

91
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,140
even know yet

92
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,820
why we've been watching Wang Bingde.

93
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,060
I haven't told you,

94
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,540
because I didn't want to scare you.

95
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,380
Once you find out what he's done,

96
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,060
and you recall the years

97
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,460
that you spent living with him,

98
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,440
I fear you'll have nightmares every night.

99
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:08,860
But,

100
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,340
if

101
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,460
you refuse to cooperate...

102
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,460
I can show you something.

103
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,660
Zoom in to take a closer look.

104
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,660
There's more.

105
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,980
Look. Swipe this way.

106
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,710
Alright, thanks.

107
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,500
Are you okay?

108
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,620
Let me pour you some water.

109
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,580
Thanks.

110
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,420
I really don't know

111
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,300
about the things he has done.

112
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,460
But if he killed this person,

113
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,700
I don't know either.

114
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,180
But I can tell you everything

115
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,260
that I know.

116
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,540
Just don't ever let me see him again.

117
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,420
What do you want to know?

118
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,940
Where is he most likely to go?

119
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,160
Give me a piece of paper and a pen.

120
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,420
Thanks.

121
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,940
These are the addresses

122
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,180
of all the properties

123
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,420
we own

124
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,060
in this city.

125
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,680
You could go check it out.

126
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:42,900
As for others,

127
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,450
I can't think of anything for now.

128
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,980
He really doesn't have close friends.

129
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,300
Most of them are just business partners.

130
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,060
On Wang Bingde,

131
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,120
is there this kind of mark?

132
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,060
It seems

133
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:04,940
to be

134
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,180
on his left arm.

135
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,580
When did it appear?

136
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,540
It's been a while, I guess.

137
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,780
He said

138
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,920
he was wearing short sleeves

139
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,460
and got burned at the construction site.

140
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,060
Getting burned at a construction site?

141
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,550
Sounds unlikely, right?

142
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,660
He didn't want to explain, so I didn't ask.

143
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,300
After the mark appeared,

144
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,700
you two just got divorced, right?

145
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:28,900
It seems so.

146
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,900
But how did you know about it?

147
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,020
Because he knows he won't have a good ending.

148
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,580
How did Wang Bingde start his fortune?

149
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,540
He told me

150
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,580
his ex-wife's family had some influence

151
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,500
and they got him some construction projects.

152
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,660
That's how he made his money.

153
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,540
Later, his ex-wife passed away.

154
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,820
What about before that?

155
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,660
He rarely talked about his earlier days.

156
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,380
Did he ever tell you

157
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,580
why he's so fond of antiques?

158
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:10,940
He just said

159
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,300
it's a personal hobby.

160
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,420
He's done

161
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,780
quite a bit of research

162
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,100
on artifacts and cultural relics.

163
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,250
He also likes fortune-telling.

164
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,020
He seems to calculate everything

165
00:11:21,044 --> 00:11:21,816
that he encounters.

166
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,420
Did he have contact with people

167
00:11:23,444 --> 00:11:24,570
in the cultural relics field?

168
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,900
I'm not sure about that.

169
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,380
Probably, yes.

170
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,060
I've never been involved in those matters.

171
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,870
I just focused on taking care of the kid.

172
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,220
Did he ever

173
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,700
secretly trade antiques before?

174
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:36,900
No, he didn't.

175
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:38,940
Actually,

176
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,300
I truly don't know what he did

177
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,300
when he was young.

178
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,780
I don't want to know, either.

179
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,540
Take a look at this.

180
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,180
His eldest son lives in the U.S.

181
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,170
Do you know about his life there?

182
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,120
That's the son he had with his ex-wife.

183
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,940
He was not very capable,

184
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,100
so he was sent to the U.S.

185
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,060
He stayed in a house there

186
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,660
and just meddled along

187
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,440
day by day.

188
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,420
We didn't interfere much.

189
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,560
He used drugs, and you didn't care?

190
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,300
That's just beyond control.

191
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,980
He and his son have fallen out.

192
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,600
He once asked his eldest son

193
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,180
to buy a bronze tripod, you know?

194
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,540
I had no idea.

195
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,140
Three days ago,

196
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,580
his eldest son was killed in the U.S.

197
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,060
Do you know why?

198
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,420
They said it is a home invasion.

199
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,100
But

200
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:18,980
he was always reckless

201
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,140
and loved showing off.

202
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,250
Trouble was bound to happen.

203
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,100
How did Wang Bingde handle it?

204
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,580
He hired a lawyer over there

205
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,820
to take care of the aftermath.

206
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,700
Mrs. Wang,

207
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,260
you are much younger than him, right?

208
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,500
So what?

209
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,440
How's your sexual life?

210
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,740
Answer the question.

211
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,820
Don't you think asking this question

212
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,980
is extremely rude?

213
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,900
Marital relations can be

214
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,540
one of the motives for the crime.

215
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,460
There's nothing rude about this.

216
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,380
Just cooperate with us.

217
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,500
It's much better than before.

218
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,740
You're the police, right?

219
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,500
Yes.

220
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,180
What did my dad do?

221
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,800
I can't say for sure yet.

222
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,460
Then what do you

223
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,780
need to do to let my mom go?

224
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,180
We're just conducting an investigation.

225
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,660
Your mom is just cooperating with us.

226
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,140
30,000.

227
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:42,980
Is it enough?

228
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,860
What do you mean?

229
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,860
30,000.

230
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,520
It's the lucky money I saved up.

231
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,770
I'm giving it all to you.

232
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,100
It's just you and me here.

233
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,500
No one else will know.

234
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,380
Take the money,

235
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,260
and leave.

236
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,180
My mom will be free.

237
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,700
It's better for everyone.

238
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,100
Is that okay?

239
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,500
What do you think?

240
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,340
50,000.

241
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,900
That's all my lucky money.

242
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,860
Plus any antique from our house.

243
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,860
Each is worth over 100,000.

244
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:13,580
Deal?

245
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,020
Who taught you this?

246
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,580
Your dad or your mom?

247
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,860
In this world,

248
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,500
problems that money can solve

249
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,440
aren't really problems.

250
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,500
Right?

251
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,480
Sounds like your dad taught you that.

252
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,980
Do you really think everything in life

253
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,100
can be solved with money?

254
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,260
Of course it can.

255
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,900
I treated the top student in class to dinner,

256
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,620
and asked him how he studies.

257
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,660
He told me, and I followed his advice.

258
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,380
Now I'm the top student.

259
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,220
In your eyes,

260
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,100
what kind of person

261
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,220
is your dad?

262
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,500
An ATM machine.

263
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,600
Pretty straightforward, huh?

264
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,270
Nothing wrong with saying it.

265
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,540
But he's getting older now.

266
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,270
We'll soon be unable to rely on him.

267
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,140
My mom's getting old too.

268
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,540
Mr. Ouyang would never marry her.

269
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,800
In the end, she'll rely on me.

270
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,860
I have to take care of this family.

271
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,860
So, do we have a deal?

272
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,580
If you can tell me where your dad went,

273
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,380
then we are done.

274
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,700
Also,

275
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,480
I need to tell you something.

276
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,100
In this world,

277
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,060
not everything

278
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,580
can be solved with money.

279
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,900
Look, it won't work with me.

280
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,740
Jie.

281
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,100
Didn't I tell you to stay inside?

282
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,200
What are you doing out here?

283
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,420
I'm just here

284
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,140
to get some fresh air.

285
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:55,940
Officer,

286
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,060
before you ask my child,

287
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,660
shouldn't you get my consent first?

288
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,300
We were just chatting.

289
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,700
Xu Xiao.

290
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,300
What did you just say?

291
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,060
Nothing, just chatting.

292
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,060
Don't talk nonsense.

293
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,820
It's fine. I didn't.

294
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,540
Let me tell you something.

295
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,940
All of his stuff here

296
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,620
is completely authentic.

297
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,420
Where's Lin?

298
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,900
He's lecturing that lawyer.

299
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,820
Why is he doing that?

300
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,260
Don't you think lately

301
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,370
he's been acting a bit off?

302
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,950
Stress is making him lose his temper.

303
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,360
Even the day we caught Zhou Daming,

304
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,640
he couldn't control himself.

305
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,580
Do you know what this is?

306
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,540
How would I know that?

307
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,420
Yarrow stalks.

308
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,120
What are they used for?

309
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,580
They're part of an ancient divination method.

310
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,940
King Wen used this

311
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,020
to interpret the hexagrams.

312
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,580
But it's a bit complicated.

313
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,060
Do you want to try calculating something?

314
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:19,940
For example,

315
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,940
wealth, career,

316
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,340
love,

317
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,220
or marriage.

318
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,910
You know how to do this?

319
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,180
Then calculate where Wang Bingde went.

320
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,940
What do you think he burned here?

321
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,340
Well...

322
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,460
Maybe it's this.

323
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,380
Guai Hexagram.

324
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,300
Guai Hexagram...

325
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,980
Guai Hexagram,

326
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,060
speaking in the court,

327
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,170
warning people the danger still exists.

328
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,370
A message from the fief warns

329
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,900
that it is unwise to use force,

330
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,480
as this would be beneficial
for future actions.

331
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,140
Basically, it means

332
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,340
if an enemy is about to invade,

333
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,420
we must prepare for defense.

334
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,660
After transformation, it's Jian Hexagram.

335
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,180
Favorable to the southwest.

336
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,500
Unfavorable to the northeast.

337
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,910
Favorable to meet a powerful figure.

338
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,140
He probably burned this before leaving home.

339
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,660
Favorable to the southwest?

340
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,180
Should we search in the southwest?

341
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,160
You actually believe this?

342
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,940
Wang Bingde is so superstitious.

343
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,020
I think it likely

344
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,700
influences his logic and actions.

345
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,860
If we could solve a case like this,

346
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,580
we cops might lose our jobs.

347
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,900
How's it going?

348
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,420
Did you guys find anything new?

349
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,980
That's where my dad kept the Guandong probe.

350
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,180
Guandong probe?

351
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,140
Take a look to see if this is it.

352
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,220
Pretty close.

353
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,260
Do you know what it's used for?

354
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,500
He used to say

355
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,900
it's something he used while making a living.

356
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,820
This is a modified Luoyang shovel.

357
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,440
It's specifically made for tomb robbers.

358
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,500
Either you don't know Wang Bingde,

359
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,940
or you're not being honest with us.

360
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,620
Officer,

361
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,940
if you really can find him,

362
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,300
could you ask him

363
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,660
why he is willing

364
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,780
to give up the business,

365
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,580
and abandon us,

366
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,020
to do such a thing?

367
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,380
Take your time.

368
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,980
This family is quite odd.

369
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,500
Such families are simply

370
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,180
a disaster for society.

371
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,540
Don't try that on me.

372
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,140
You're obligated to cooperate with us.

373
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,020
Do you understand?

374
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,020
In China, you must follow Chinese laws.

375
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,060
Lin.

376
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,100
We checked upstairs.

377
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,540
Wang Bingde does have this subject.

378
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,180
Great, let's go find him.

379
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,980
No need, Dafei and Xiaoxing will go.

380
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,640
- Alright.
- Let's check on Zhao Zhengru.

381
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:47,300
(Zhengru Real Estate)

382
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,140
Officer,

383
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,220
this is Lawyer Du, whom you've met before.

384
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,580
This is Deputy Manager Wang.

385
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,530
- Hello.
- Hello.

386
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,100
Hello, we're from the Major Crimes Unit.

387
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,080
Alright, this way please.

388
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,180
Mr. Zhao is an exceptional person.

389
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,980
He's always kind to everyone.

390
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,180
He's the best boss I've ever met.

391
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,660
This is Zhou from the sales department.

392
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,210
His mother is critically ill.

393
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,860
Zhou,

394
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,480
I've already told the finance department.

395
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,180
They'll advance you 100,000 yuan for now.

396
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,640
If that's not enough, let me know.

397
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,260
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

398
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,770
I don't know how to repay you.

399
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,870
Everyone goes through difficult times.

400
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,300
Working hard

401
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,780
is the best reward for the company.

402
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,700
I promise I will.

403
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,540
Get back to work.

404
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,360
Ms. Zhao, a cleaning lady,

405
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,700
just moved to the city.

406
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:48,820
Greetings, Mr. Zhao.

407
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,460
Zhao,

408
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,900
don't worry about your child's school.

409
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,460
I've already found a school.

410
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,220
Just take him there when it's time.

411
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,300
Thank you so much!

412
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,180
You really are

413
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,060
a living Buddha!

414
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,900
We both have the surname Zhao.

415
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,910
We may be from the same family 500 years ago.

416
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,420
Thanks, I'll get back to work.

417
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,300
This is Mr. Zhao's office.

418
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,740
Feel free to look around.

419
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,860
Has the tech team been here yet?

420
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,460
Yes, they came last night.

421
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,380
Did they find anything?

422
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:56,980
Nothing so far.

423
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,820
Captain Xu,

424
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,220
I actually know that person.

425
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,100
You mean the murderer?

426
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,420
Yes.

427
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,900
I... I was too scared yesterday,

428
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,020
so I didn't talk to you.

429
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,100
I'm sorry.

430
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:20,980
Go on.

431
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,100
His name is Wang Bingde.

432
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,320
He works in construction.

433
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,050
He's very close to Mr. Zhao.

434
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,000
The earthwork and landscaping for several

435
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,610
of our properties are all handled by him.

436
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,420
Is there any grudges between them?

437
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,020
I checked with the finance department.

438
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,820
All accounts with his company

439
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,020
were settled promptly.

440
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,300
Mr. Zhao is a very fair person.

441
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,740
- He rarely delays payments.
- Exactly.

442
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,900
This is well-known in the industry.

443
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,340
Wang Bingde should be grateful

444
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,660
to Mr. Zhao.

445
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,100
Absolutely.

446
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,100
Do they have any private interactions?

447
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,540
Both of them really like

448
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,220
antiques.

449
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,580
Yes, several of Mr. Zhao's antiques

450
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,100
were purchased with Wang Bingde's help.

451
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:02,980
What antiques?

452
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,900
Mostly calligraphy and paintings.

453
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,140
Nothing else.

454
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,660
Anything in other areas?

455
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,220
No.

456
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,020
Zhao, no,

457
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,620
Mr. Zhao is a practitioner.

458
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,820
Yes, he follows a vegetarian diet,

459
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,620
worships Buddha, and stays single.

460
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,260
- Right.
- Everyone in the company knows.

461
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,100
How old is Mr. Zhao?

462
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,340
47.

463
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,340
47?

464
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,420
Single?

465
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:24,740
How is that possible?

466
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,580
Here's the story.

467
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,860
I heard

468
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,100
he had a girlfriend in college.

469
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,340
They were deeply in love.

470
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,780
But they had some disagreements later.

471
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,940
The girlfriend moved abroad.

472
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,300
Since then,

473
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,060
he's been single

474
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,620
and never dated anyone again.

475
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,780
Visit his place.

476
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,720
We want to check out his place.

477
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,100
Sure.

478
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,740
Secretary Sun, take them there.

479
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,380
- Alright, let's go.
- Okay.

480
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,700
Ms. Chen, we're leaving.

481
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,580
He's in his prime,

482
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,580
devoted to love,

483
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,220
single, and wealthy.

484
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,100
As good as a saint.

485
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,020
Don't overestimate men.

486
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,860
Men like that exist.

487
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,180
Captain Xu.

488
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,860
Lin, don't talk nonsense.

489
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,820
I'm neither rich nor young anymore.

490
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,340
I am not a saint.

491
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,340
(Zhengru Real Estate)

492
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,380
I'm not needed here, huh?

493
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,860
I have to return to the site.

494
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,810
Let me give you a ride.

495
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:18,860
No need.

496
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,700
Does Mr. Zhao usually live alone?

497
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,060
Yes.

498
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,380
None of us have been to his house.

499
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,360
He keeps work and personal life separate.

500
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,720
He never lets us interfere

501
00:27:44,744 --> 00:27:45,644
in private matters.

502
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,860
You haven't been here either?

503
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,500
No, I haven't.

504
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,010
How long have you been his secretary?

505
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,540
Four years.

506
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,700
Then

507
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,180
who takes care of his life?

508
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,100
He always takes care of himself.

509
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,540
Such a strong smell of Chinese medicine.

510
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,460
Yeah.

511
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,580
Judging by the smell,

512
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,070
I guess he never skipped a single day.

513
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,340
Let's check downstairs.

514
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,460
Alright.

515
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,140
Mr. Zhao likes to work out?

516
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,100
Yes, he does.

517
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,020
He always keeps himself in great shape.

518
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,020
He also likes classical music.

519
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,340
It's the same person.

520
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:31,980
It sounds awful.

521
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,060
Switch it over.

522
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:49,980
That material

523
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,380
doesn't retain any smell.

524
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,820
I'll check the second floor.

525
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:28,940
Lin?

526
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,100
I'm here.

527
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,170
What kind of place is this?

528
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,540
Mr. Zhao's Zen room.

529
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:51,300
(The portrait of Immortal Liu)

530
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,220
Captain Xu.

531
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,820
Could this be

532
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,020
the tortoise shell?

533
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,300
Guang, Guang!

534
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,180
Come here, quick!

535
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,260
Take this for comparison.

536
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,470
- Quickly!
- Got it.

537
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:09,300
This guy wants to break

538
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,540
the cocoon and be reborn.

539
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,900
This is exactly the same as what

540
00:34:33,924 --> 00:34:35,324
was found at Wang Bingde's house.

541
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,300
Look, there's also a saw.

542
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,180
At least three people in this group.

543
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,020
Zhou Daye, Wang Bingde,

544
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:42,900
and Zhao Zhengru.

545
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,780
Each of them has this system.

546
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,380
They must use the same system to make calls.

547
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,600
After their chat on the agreed day,

548
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,720
just destroy it and throw it.

549
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,180
Also,

550
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,100
Wang Bingde's wife mentioned

551
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:58,220
he has a cicada pattern mark on his left arm.

552
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,300
All three of them have it.

553
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,940
They must be accomplices.

554
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:04,900
Wang Yixuan,

555
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,100
Zhou Daming,

556
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,020
they are peripheral members.

557
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,870
But why didn't we find these things

558
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:11,980
at Zhou Daye's house?

559
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,500
The suspect must've taken them away.

560
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,270
Afraid the police would discover them.

561
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,760
Those two had a falling out.

562
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,740
They probably didn't expect

563
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,220
the police to search their homes.

564
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,540
Wang Bingde

565
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:27,940
kept a Guandong probe

566
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,260
at home.

567
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,660
His wife said it is his tool

568
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,860
to making a living before.

569
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,740
But when he left home,

570
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,870
he took that thing with him.

571
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,420
And he used it

572
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,660
to kill Zhao Zhengru.

573
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,500
I'm wondering if Wang Yixuan was killed

574
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,740
under the instigation of Zhao Zhengru.

575
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,500
That was his accomplice's son.

576
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,780
Why would he kill him?

577
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,900
Now I suspect Zhou Daye's death

578
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,780
is also linked to Zhao Zhengru.

579
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,580
He hired someone.

580
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,550
Because they were exposed.

581
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,950
You witnessed Zhou Daye's body disposal.

582
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,540
Wang Yixuan buying the tripod

583
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,500
was also discovered.

584
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,750
The only solution was to silence them.

585
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,300
Zhao Zhengru even tried to kill Wang Bingde.

586
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,940
But Wang Bingde

587
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:12,820
struck first

588
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:13,900
and killed him.

589
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,020
I was just wondering

590
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:19,540
why Zhao Zhengru got involved.

591
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,300
Immortality.

592
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,780
Is a reason even needed?

593
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,780
When people gain wealth and power,

594
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,940
they want to hold onto it forever,

595
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,420
especially when they get older.

596
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:32,940
When you reach my age,

597
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,820
you'll understand.

598
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,180
At your age, I might not understand either.

599
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,500
But speaking of Zhao Zhengru,

600
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,560
considering his status and position,

601
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,970
he has a massive family and fortune,

602
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,220
and beyond that,

603
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,660
he holds significant social standing.

604
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,300
This pursuit of immortality,

605
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,620
compared to committing a crime,

606
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,420
carries far greater risks and costs.

607
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,620
Higher than Wang Bingde and Zhou Daye.

608
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,180
Captain Xu,

609
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,220
take a look at this.

610
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,940
There are a total of 143 videos.

611
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,460
Most of them is this woman

612
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,620
dancing provocatively

613
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,620
in front of Zhao Zhengru

614
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,540
in different types

615
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,580
of sexy lingerie.

616
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,060
Some are even more explicit.

617
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,320
Could they be on his computer?

618
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,180
When were these videos recorded?

619
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,700
The earliest one is from a year ago.

620
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,780
And the latest is from a month ago.

621
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,580
Search for the files from May 6th.

622
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,160
See if we can find anything.

623
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,460
Found it.

624
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,060
Based on the video timestamps,

625
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,580
I checked his phone call logs

626
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,060
and identified this woman.

627
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,140
I get her name, address, and location.

628
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,640
I've already sent someone to find her.

629
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,140
Are these all her videos?

630
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:50,380
Yes, all hers.

631
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,500
All 143 videos are hers.

632
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,140
Great job!

633
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,430
Hello?

634
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,660
Captain Xu,

635
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,220
I checked the tortoise shell.

636
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,040
It matches the imprint on the cushion

637
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,580
from Zhou Daye's safe perfectly.

638
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,660
It likely belonged there originally.

639
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,660
Got it. I'll ask the consultant

640
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,760
to recognize the text on it.

641
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,820
Keep it safe for now.

642
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:36,940
Understood, Captain Xu.

643
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,220
