Ding Dang.

Xiaoxing, rescue her.

5
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,570
Okay.

6
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,170
Don't move.

7
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,540
Dafei.

8
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,420
Here.

9
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,170
Take him away.

10
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,060
- Get up.
- Go.

11
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:55,940
Yes.

12
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,140
Cuff him. Take him away.

13
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,540
Go.

14
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:04,820
Easy there.

15
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,700
Be careful.

16
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:25,820
Did you call the police?

17
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,030
Why'd you take so long?

18
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,650
Finding you was hard enough.

19
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,140
Are you hurt?

20
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,890
Do I look hurt?

21
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,210
Why did you go back?

22
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,150
I went back

23
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,450
to stall Wang Bingde.

24
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,490
Giving you more time.

25
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,330
Well done.

Where did he go?

32
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,220
Moved to Bed 10.

33
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:51,980
Bed 10?

34
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,860
Thanks.

35
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,940
Why moved to Bed 10?

36
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:56,820
How should I know?

37
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,660
Here.

38
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,780
Come on.

39
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,060
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.

40
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,050
Have more.

41
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,450
Those people are like demons.

42
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,060
Being a cop sometimes

43
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:56,890
can be overwhelming.

44
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,220
Let's go.

45
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,620
Wang Bingde.

46
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,620
Wang Xiang.

47
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,500
That's me.

48
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,360
On the fifth of this month,

49
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,180
you abducted two women

50
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,220
and took them to the old

51
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,530
Dashan Coal Processing Plant
in Binxi New District,

52
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,350
and carried out murders
and ritual sacrifices.

53
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,460
Isn't that right?

54
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,420
Wang Bingde,

55
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,660
at the scene where we arrested you,

56
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,780
we found body parts
from several female victims.

57
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,420
The evidence is solid.

58
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,560
Stop denying.

59
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,060
Talk.

60
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,300
That's right.

61
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,140
I did it all.

62
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,660
Killed four in total.

63
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,660
Those women

64
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,620
were just a burden

65
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,660
to this world.

66
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,020
People like you

67
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,420
are the real burden.

68
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,460
Who else was involved?

69
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,120
What's your relationship

70
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,420
with Zhou Daye and Zhao Zhengru?

71
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,620
How did your son Wang Yixuan

72
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,660
get involved in this?

73
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,060
Why did you kill Zhao Zhengru?

74
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,540
Only these two guys.

75
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,340
My useless son

76
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,820
just helped with a tripod.

77
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,740
Yu Kingdom Tripod.

78
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,420
Fifty thousand.

79
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,460
Yet Zhao Zhengru got him killed.

80
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,540
He killed Zhou Daye too.

81
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,020
Zhao did it all

82
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,660
to protect himself.

83
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,540
But more than that,

84
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,420
he wanted the immortality technique
all to himself.

85
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,420
Hello?

86
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:01,860
Is this Mr. Zhao?

87
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,140
Why'd you kill Zhou Daye?

88
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,460
It had nothing to do with me.

89
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,340
Zhou Wenhao wouldn't dare.

90
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,700
You must've pushed him.

91
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,220
A death means safety.

92
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,420
Benefits both of us.

93
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,500
You seem upset about Zhou.

94
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,380
Are you heartbroken?

95
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,740
Think having the tortoise shell

96
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,300
means you can go solo?

97
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,820
I didn't take any shell.

98
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,580
With your vast knowledge,

99
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,660
you can easily see there's

100
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,260
more than one piece of the turtle shell.

101
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,460
I don't care how many pieces there are.

102
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,300
(Shuoyang Detention Center)
Then you started watching me.

103
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,260
I had nothing to lose.

104
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,820
So I had to take out Zhao Zhengru.

105
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,620
You noticed

106
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,500
our surveillance?

107
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,420
Where's the fourth victim's body?

108
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:26,900
Where did you dump it?

109
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,940
I didn't.

110
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,060
It's buried in the underground chamber.

111
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,820
Where did these dark rituals come from?

112
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:43,980
Zhou Jiahei.

113
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,260
Jiahei

114
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,140
took the tortoise shells

115
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,820
from the Yu Kingdom Tomb.

116
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,340
He saw that mural

117
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,460
and pulled out that tooth.

118
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,420
What a pity.

119
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,580
I was too young at the time.

120
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,460
Couldn't understand his obsession

121
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,660
and determination.

122
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,660
Later, I became wealthier.

123
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,660
And older.

124
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,700
That's when I realized what it all meant.

125
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,940
So, I brought in Daye

126
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,260
and Mr. Zhao

127
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,260
to retrace Jiahei's path

128
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,340
and restart this grand experiment.

129
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,300
Mr. Zhao.

130
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,660
Do you really believe in this?

131
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,540
I'm telling you,

132
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,020
it's real.

133
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,100
You haven't tried it,

134
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,700
so my words mean little.

135
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,500
Stop the nonsense.

136
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,020
Why did you go after Ding Dang again?

137
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,780
Why her specifically?

138
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,500
Is there

139
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,060
something on her you need?

140
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,260
From the moment

141
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,140
that ritual mark was carved on her,

142
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,180
her fate was sealed.

143
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:09,900
What about Chen Nan?

144
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,540
Why did you take her hostage?

145
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,180
She brought it on herself.

146
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,060
So did you.

147
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,620
Alright. Bye.

148
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,020
Need me to walk you up?

149
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,500
No, I'm good. See you.

150
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,540
Go on.

151
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,420
Bye.

152
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,060
You know why I'm so honest with you?

153
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:51,940
Because I know

154
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,300
I'm about to die soon.

155
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,340
I take this conversation

156
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,300
like a sermon.

157
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,860
Maybe,

158
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,780
one of you

159
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,660
will make it big one day,

160
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,300
rise to a higher level,

161
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,060
and finally understand why I said all this.

162
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,390
If that's what it takes,

163
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,420
we'd rather never make it big.

164
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,100
Wang Bingde,

165
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,780
misguided ideas can be dangerous.

166
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,700
You're a prime example.

167
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,420
Kong,

168
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,060
this perspective is valid,

169
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,100
but this citation

170
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,100
should be in English.

171
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,220
Especially

172
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,300
the capitalization.

173
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:55,860
Got it, Professor.

174
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:58,900
Chen Nan.

175
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,100
Come over here a second.

176
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,540
Go ahead.

177
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,700
Thanks, Professor.

178
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,460
Mr. Han.

179
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,780
Have a seat.

180
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,260
Do you know why I called you?

181
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,580
Yes.

182
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,460
About the thesis.

183
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,260
Do you think your thesis

184
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,220
will pass?

185
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,460
Mr. Han,

186
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,300
do I have to rewrite

187
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,180
my thesis?

188
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,380
Chen Nan,

189
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,540
I wanted to talk to you today

190
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,700
about the incident

191
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,780
where you

192
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,700
brought the police to follow me.

193
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,260
Mr. Han,

194
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,740
I honestly didn't mean to.

195
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,300
But it happened.

196
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,900
Because of this,

197
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,660
Zhao Qian had a long talk with me.

198
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,300
I've been

199
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,740
thinking thoroughly

200
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,900
about what she said

201
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,380
over and over.

202
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,420
I think she makes a good point.

203
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,060
All these years,

204
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,300
I've been devoted to archaeology.

205
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,260
I've achieved some success at work,

206
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,940
but my family life

207
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,020
and my personal life is a mess.

208
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,820
I feel like

209
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,940
I should plan

210
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,980
my life better.

211
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,220
Mr. Han,

212
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,060
I really didn't

213
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,620
mean any harm.

214
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,860
Curiosity drove me.

215
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,140
I didn't expect

216
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,700
to cause you such trouble.

217
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,900
I'm sorry.

218
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,460
But I want to say,

219
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,580
I put real effort into my thesis.

220
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,900
If there's anything wrong with it,

221
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,940
I'd really appreciate your guidance.

222
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,180
Even in the same field,

223
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,220
on the same issue,

224
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,300
everyone's perspective

225
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,380
and research methods

226
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,340
are different.

227
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,540
Everything in my thesis

228
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,220
was rigorously validated.

229
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,780
Chen Nan,

230
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,900
your thesis

231
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,660
has passed.

232
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,500
I've already submitted

233
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,940
a report to the Faculty Office.

234
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,340
I've decided

235
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,740
to take some time off

236
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,140
to clear my head.

237
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,700
While I'm away,

238
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,620
you will be in charge

239
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,620
of all the work.

240
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,540
Go ahead.

241
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,390
Tell He Xiang to come over.

242
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,020
Mr. Han.

243
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,900
Thank you.

244
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,860
Go on.

245
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,980
Chen Nan.

246
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,620
Chen Nan.

247
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,420
You're here.

248
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,300
I brought coffee.

249
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,220
Has Wang Bingde confessed?

250
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,900
Yes, very smoothly.

251
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,960
What about the second tortoise shell?

252
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,460
It's with him.

253
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,390
Once the site's cleared,

254
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,370
we'll hand it to you.

255
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,300
And the tripod?

256
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,780
We've retrieved it

257
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,540
along with the girls' torsos.

258
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,380
Where's Mr. Han?

259
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,820
He went to Pit No. 2.

260
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,500
Gotta go.

261
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,580
Over there.

262
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,740
Well...

263
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,980
Immortality.

264
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,660
The immortality technique.

265
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,740
If only immortality

266
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,460
really existed in this world…

267
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,700
I remember you told me,

268
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,780
the king of Yu Kingdom

269
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,020
died at 62.

270
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,500
I said he was well taken care of.

271
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,380
Not that surprising.

272
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,220
But look, your report says,

273
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,020
there's another skeleton near the coffin.

274
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,100
Male.

275
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,060
Dental age 62 years old.

276
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,380
Coincidence?

277
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,980
It's his servant.

278
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,540
I've explained this to you before.

279
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,020
Most Monarchs usually

280
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,460
would have their servants,

281
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,460
beloved concubines,

282
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,220
and his favorite dogs and horses

283
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,380
with them in the main chamber.

284
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,340
Were royal corpses

285
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,220
specially

286
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,380
preserved?

287
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:35,660
Yes.

288
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,980
They underwent extensive
embalming procedures.

289
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:42,140
In Kingly System in the Book of Rites,

290
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,260
it says the emperor is
encoffined in seven days

291
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,420
and buried in seven months.

292
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,020
Lords are encoffined in five days

293
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,030
and buried in five months.

294
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,460
Basically, his body

295
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,940
stayed in the chamber for a long time.

296
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,380
Your report states that

297
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,380
the skeleton outside the coffin

298
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,580
had sulfur

299
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,020
and arsenic levels

300
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,220
higher than the one in the coffin.

301
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,500
Moreover, the one inside

302
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,020
has knife wounds on the ribs.

303
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,380
Can you explain that?

304
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,260
In the last 20 years

305
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,860
of the Yu Kingdom,

306
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,940
there were four coups.

307
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:17,180
So it's normal for the Monarch
to have wounds.

308
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,260
Plus, his servant

309
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,940
might've secretly taken his elixirs,

310
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,180
which were quite trendy then.

311
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,420
So the chemical traces

312
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,380
on his body

313
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,220
are quite normal.

314
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,700
I think maybe

315
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,220
you got distracted

316
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,900
by that dental age data.

317
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,620
It pulled

318
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,820
your focus,

319
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,700
so you overlooked these details.

320
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,480
What are you trying to say?

321
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,020
Maybe the one in the coffin

322
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,660
isn't the Monarch at all.

323
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,060
Maybe it's the inventor
of the ritual

324
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,700
and the maker of the tripod.

325
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,020
The kingdom's high priest,

326
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:54,900
Liu Chuan.

327
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,300
Why is that?

328
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,460
Because he was a manipulator.

329
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,380
The kings of Yu Kingdom

330
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,820
came and went,

331
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,180
but Liu Chuan's position

332
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,180
never changed.

333
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,260
Ever wonder why?

334
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,220
He conned

335
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,260
every single one of them.

336
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,740
If you were king,

337
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,100
and your time was up,

338
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,700
how would you handle Liu Chuan?

339
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,420
You know immortality technique,

340
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,420
Liu Chuan?

341
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,380
You didn't complete it

342
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,860
this life?

343
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,660
Then let's go.

344
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,500
To the underworld.

345
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,380
Finish it there.

346
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,260
So Liu Chuan had only one end—

347
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,540
burial sacrifice.

348
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:28,980
A swift stab.

349
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,300
Buried alive.

350
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,420
But here's

351
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,860
where it gets creepy.

352
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,940
That's why I said

353
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,220
the skeleton outside

354
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,260
the coffin is the king.

355
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,580
Not only was it embalmed,

356
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,700
but your report says

357
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,260
the dental age

358
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,420
is also 62.

359
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,300
Inside the coffin

360
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,460
is Liu Chuan

361
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,460
with stab wounds on him.

362
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,220
But why would he do that?

363
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,500
To keep the con going.

364
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,020
To fool people

365
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,460
like Zhou Jiahei.

366
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,860
You know, age by teeth is ancient.

367
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,460
Liu Chuan is purposely trying to make

368
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,380
teeth age and history not match.

369
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:02,940
Plus, with him holding

370
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,900
two pieces of shell

371
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,060
describing the so-called

372
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,180
immortality technique.

373
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,940
It's hard not to believe his lies.

374
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,820
This occult practice spreads on.

375
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,140
That's his real aim.

376
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,660
Your theory

377
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:14,980
does make some sense.

378
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,740
But in historical research,

379
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,260
a theory is just a theory.

380
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,180
If you're done with the tripod,

381
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,180
could I

382
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,260
borrow it again?

383
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,820
Hello?

384
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,100
Alright.

385
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,420
Something urgent came up.

386
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,700
I've got to go.

387
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,300
The tripod…

388
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,020
(Shuoyang Institute of Archaeology)

Guo.

393
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,230
What's the rush?

394
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,100
You came quickly.

395
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,380
Come, let me show you.

396
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,700
Get ready.

397
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,300
That jerk.

398
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,260
Such a temper.

399
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,820
(Eat)

400
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,580
Senior.

401
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,460
Scans are done.

402
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,540
Kong, bring the tripod.

403
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,420
Okay.

404
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,140
Put it here.

405
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,040
Open the lid, thanks.

406
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,660
You two, go get the camera.

407
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,540
Sure.

408
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,540
Xu Xiao, I found something.

409
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:51,460
(Interrogation Room)

410
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,700
Xiaoxing.

411
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,660
Wang Bingde,

412
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,540
we found four female torsos

413
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,060
at your ritual site.

414
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,780
But no internal organs.

415
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,500
Where did you put them?

416
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,580
I threw them away.

417
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,020
Where?

418
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,260
I forgot.

419
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,260
This tortoise shell details

420
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,580
the Immortality Ritual steps.

421
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,100
Did you all follow them?

422
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,700
That's right.

423
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,540
So,

424
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,460
just as you thought.

425
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,500
He's insane.

426
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,660
How could you do such a thing?

427
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,200
Have you lost your humanity?

428
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,340
I'm not human.

429
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,660
I'm a god.

430
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,300
Do you still not realize

431
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,060
the Immortality Ritual is fake?

432
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,340
You're lying.

433
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,060
I have no reason to lie to you.

434
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,300
The one who lied was Liu Chuan.

435
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,100
Did you know?

436
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,780
That fraud

437
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,020
fooled four kings

438
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,940
with these tricks.

439
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,420
Even before death,

440
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,400
he took it to his grave,

441
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,700
hoping to deceive for ages.

442
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,180
Isn't that pathetic?

443
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,940
Look.

444
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,700
Even rulers fall to desire.

445
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,980
These so-called mystics

446
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,820
manipulate rulers' desires

447
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,660
to gain wealth and fame.

448
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,100
In the end,

449
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,180
they fool even themselves

450
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,500
into thinking they're divine

451
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,020
like a god,

452
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,340
right?

453
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,300
Utterly foolish!

454
00:28:54,820 --> 00:29:01,820
(Interrogation Room, ECI Office)

455
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,780
Can you believe

456
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,470
what they've turned into?

457
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,860
Because of desire.

458
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,980
Desire needs boundaries.

459
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,660
Once crossing the line,

460
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,300
people turns into monsters.

461
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,580
We must uphold this line,

462
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,700
and also,

463
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,340
catch the monsters.

464
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,100
Son,

465
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,460
the massage chair for your dad arrived.

466
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,780
He's really happy.

467
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,580
Son,

468
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:50,180
come home for dinner when you're free.

469
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,540
It's been a while since we all gathered.

470
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,420
I'll come home once I wrap things up.

471
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,940
Zhou Wenhao's been caught.

472
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,180
How'd we get him?

473
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,620
He tried to leave through Yunnan.

474
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,820
Border patrol caught him

475
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:29,940
and sent him over.

476
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,300
- He confessed?
- He did.

477
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,420
Said he killed Zhou Daye.

478
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,900
Suffocated him with a glue gun

479
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,780
in the coffin.

480
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,940
His crimes are serious.

481
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,460
Charged with murder,

482
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,020
grave robbing,

483
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,300
and trafficking relics.

484
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,540
Multiple crimes.

485
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,420
He's got it coming.

486
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,740
But what was his motive

487
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,620
for killing Zhou Daye?

488
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,660
Said it was to avenge Zhou Daming.

489
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,860
(Q: Do you know why you're detained?)

490
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,060
(A: Yes. Because I killed Zhou Daye.)

491
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,380
Doesn't add up.

492
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,980
The first tortoise shell

493
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:00,420
should've been at Zhou Daye's place.

494
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,420
Why did it end up at Zhao Zhengru's?

495
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,060
I was wondering the same.

496
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,580
He confessed Zhao Zhengru hired him.

497
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,620
Zhou Daye killed Zhou Daming.

498
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,660
He became the scapegoat.

499
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,820
Then Zhao Zhengru

500
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,700
hired Zhou Wenhao

501
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,780
to kill Zhou Daye

502
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,860
to cover it all up.

503
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,420
And took the first tortoise shell.

504
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,020
The ultimate goal is

505
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,540
just to monopolize the so-called

506
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,940
immortality technique.

507
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,020
Well done, Xiaoxing.

508
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,620
You're improving now.

509
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,780
You two keep it up.

510
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,460
Alright, back to work.

511
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,360
- Got it.
- Got it.

512
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,540
Dad, I'm downstairs.

513
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,660
Need me to bring anything up?

514
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,780
No need to bring anything.

515
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,260
Just glad you're back.

516
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,580
Come on up.

517
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:27,020
(Third Class Merit)

518
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:32,460
(Name: Lin Qi, Age: 9, Grade 3, Class 1)

519
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,380
So much good food.

520
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,460
Why is this pizza square?

521
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,100
- You ordered it?
- It's recommended.

522
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,060
- Cap.
- By whom?

523
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:48,920
- Cap.
- Don't touch it.

524
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,060
- I'll snap a pic.
- Coming.

525
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,500
Shouldn't we open this first?

526
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:52,500
Alright.

527
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,420
Yes. Open it up.

528
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,300
Not yet.

529
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,140
It's called creating a moment.

530
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,020
Need to make a memory.

531
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,200
You don't get it at all.

532
00:33:58,210 --> 00:33:59,220
Where's everyone else?

533
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,900
Off duty. The rest of us are here.

534
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,220
- Where's Lin?
- Lin is

535
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,700
busy. Said next time.

536
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,540
Let's eat before it gets cold.

537
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,140
- Come on. Have some.
- Here.

538
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,260
Before we dig in,

539
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,180
I've got a message

540
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,940
from Director Yang.

541
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:14,980
Everyone did a great job

542
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,420
on this operation.

543
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,300
Well done.

544
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,260
You all get a half-day off tomorrow morning.

545
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,100
After that, you need

546
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,180
to keep up the good work.

547
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,780
Please send my regards

548
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,740
and thanks to everyone.

549
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,460
That's it?

550
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,580
Just a half-day off?

551
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,060
What more do you want?

552
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,660
Pizza's on me. Alright?

553
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,420
- Just…
- If we'd known you were buying,

554
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,460
we should've ordered more.

555
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,180
Don't be so greedy.

556
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,060
Captain Xu,

557
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,420
are we missing someone?

558
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,460
That's right.

559
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,420
- Yeah.
- I asked. She can't come.

560
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,620
We didn't say who it was.

561
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,100
Exactly.

562
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,060
You mean Ms. Chen, right?

563
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,460
Xiaoxing, this is on you.

564
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,010
- You insisted on inviting him.
- Yeah.

565
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,580
You probably messed up their plans.

566
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,940
My bad.

567
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,620
No, I really asked her.

568
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,820
She couldn't make it.

569
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:04,860
I'll make a call.

570
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,820
Can I make a call?

571
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,060
Put it on speaker.

572
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,260
Sure, I'm not afraid.

573
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,180
Ms. Chen.

574
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:16,940
We're having pizza.

575
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,700
I said I invited you.

576
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,740
They wouldn't believe me.

577
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,100
Say hi to Ms. Chen.

578
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,300
Dr. Chen.

579
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,300
We just started.

580
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,820
- Come join us.
- Yeah!

581
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,340
You're our honorary hero.

582
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,300
You should come.

583
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,140
Hurry up.

584
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:29,090
It's really good.

585
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,300
Come on.

586
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,620
I'd love to.

587
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,220
But I've got a work task.

588
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:35,340
Might not make it in time.

589
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,460
It's just a meal, you can make it.

590
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,180
Want a private dinner with Xu?

591
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,780
Working with you guys

592
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,100
has been a joy.

593
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,580
But once

594
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,020
is enough.

595
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,580
Alright.

596
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,140
You guys eat.

597
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:49,440
We're starting without you.

598
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:50,300
Dig in.

599
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,780
- Have a seat.
- No, I…

600
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,060
- Help yourself.
- We're just starting.

601
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,260
You can still make it.

602
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,500
Everyone misses you.

603
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,180
I wish I could come.

604
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,980
But I'm heading to Italy on Monday

605
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,340
for a relics restoration.

606
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,500
Really?

607
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,580
You never mentioned it.

608
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,300
I was tied up with your case,

609
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,300
remember?

610
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,380
Now it can't wait any longer.

611
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,020
Do I have

612
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,260
to report all my plans

613
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,260
to you from now on?

614
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,780
Even if I do,

615
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,100
I might not have time to listen.

616
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,500
Seriously. If you go abroad,

617
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,100
watch out

618
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,340
over there.

619
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,580
The mob scene is no joke.

620
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,020
Stay safe.

621
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,340
Do you want

622
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,620
to come be my bodyguard?

623
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:40,020
We can't enforce laws abroad.

624
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,420
What if I never

625
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,300
come back?

626
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,860
What do you mean?

627
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,580
Didn't you say it's dangerous over there?

628
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,500
What if something happens?

629
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,340
Don't be ridiculous.

630
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,940
What are you talking about?

631
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,620
Relax. I'm just joking.

632
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,420
Let's stay in touch.

633
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,460
Sure. No problem.

634
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,420
Also,

635
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,460
there are some documents

636
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,660
I haven't finished preparing.

637
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,390
I'll have my colleague sent them to you.

638
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,380
Alright.

639
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,260
Hey.

640
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,340
Just

641
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,900
stay safe, okay?

642
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,900
When you're back, that meal's on me.

643
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,220
Alright.

644
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,100
Bye.

645
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,560
Why staring at me?

646
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:30,420
Let's eat.

647
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,740
Lin, you look good.

648
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,740
Let's go.

649
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,620
Here.

650
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,620
Enjoy.

651
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,660
Thanks.

652
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,500
This is nice.

653
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,220
Dig in.

654
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:28,980
The chive filling

655
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,020
is missing shrimp.

656
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,340
With shrimp, it'd be perfect.

657
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:32,670
I'll make you some at home.

658
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,020
Mr. Lin.

659
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:08,900
Mr. Lin.

660
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,020
What brings you here?

661
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,420
We want to go over

662
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,160
all the evidence related to the case again.

663
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,300
Can you get the stuff

664
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,180
we've stored here?

665
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,300
Alright.

666
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,900
- Same drill.
- Sure.

667
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:28,780
Let me.

668
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,300
There's more.

669
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,100
Here you go.

670
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,780
Count it carefully.

671
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,860
Should be no mistakes.

672
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:46,740
- Thank you, Mr. Lin.
- Keep it up.

673
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,060
Appreciate it.

674
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:52,180
I'll brew some dampness-dispelling tea
for you.

675
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,780
- Sounds good.
- Thanks.

676
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,460
You should get some sun more often.

677
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,180
The broken phone.

678
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,060
Zero Two Nine.

679
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,220
A jade ring. 03129.

680
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:09,060
Captain Xu, with all this evidence,

681
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,260
shall we organize it later?

682
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,580
Dafei's hungry.

683
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:19,140
Yeah, I'm the hungry one.

684
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,940
Okay. Start ordering.

685
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,380
I'll join you later.

686
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,340
- Sure.
- Don't hold back.

687
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,220
Got it.

688
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:48,140
(The portrait of Immortal Liu)

689
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,740
The portrait of Immortal Liu.

690
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,260
The person here is Liu Chuan.

691
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,620
We've seen this picture

692
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:03,900
in several places.

693
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,220
(The portrait of Immortal Liu)

694
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,620
But don't you find it odd?

695
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,260
Such a ceremony

696
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,220
should have a priest

697
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,620
like Liu Chuan to lead.

698
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:22,140
Wang Bingde and his people

699
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,660
couldn't have pulled that off.

700
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,700
So you're saying

701
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,980
there's a modern-day Liu Chuan?

702
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,460
Who could it be?

703
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:57,820
Where

704
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,140
