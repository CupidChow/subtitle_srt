=Episode 10=

3
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,780
What case are you working on lately?

4
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,290
Sorry, I broke the rules.

5
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,100
Apologies.

6
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,290
I won't ask anymore.

7
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,890
Xu, are you married?

8
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:30,690
No, I'm not.

9
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,010
Do you have a girlfriend?

10
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,660
No, I don't.

11
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,610
No time for dating?

12
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,690
I think you don't talk much,

13
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,170
so girls don't want to chat with you.

14
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,260
You seem strong and capable.

15
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,210
You should make time to find a girlfriend,

16
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,050
right?

17
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,940
You can't avoid dating and marriage forever.

18
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,220
Yeah, just no time for it.

19
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,780
When I'm free,

20
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,500
I'm busy with cases.

21
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,610
I know. I know you're busy.

22
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,820
Always staying up late and working overtime.

23
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,340
And smoking.

24
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,940
The car smells strongly of smoke.

25
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,010
Zhang, I don't smoke.

26
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,760
Maybe my colleague smoked here.

27
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,170
Actually, we don't always

28
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,660
stay up late when not on cases.

29
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,220
Anyway, I'm healthy. No worries.

30
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:28,900
Alright.

31
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,610
Health is everything.

32
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:32,780
You must keep fit.

33
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,180
Right, exactly.

34
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,130
Let me introduce a girl to you.

35
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:38,860
Don't worry.

36
00:03:38,884 --> 00:03:40,584
I won't set you up with anyone unreliable.

37
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,540
She's a distant niece of mine.

38
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,100
An overseas returnee.

39
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,030
She's highly educated

40
00:03:45,054 --> 00:03:45,986
and has a house and car.

41
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:46,890
She's great, really.

42
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,060
You, you...

43
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,780
Don't stress out. These days...

44
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,890
No need, really.

45
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:54,170
Being an overseas returnee isn't special.

46
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,820
No, no, no, I just...

47
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,340
It's just that you guys,

48
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,340
as police officers, earn so little.

49
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,620
You really should

50
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,660
find financially stable,

51
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,780
an independent woman.

52
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,940
You just focus on

53
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,940
being heroes out there.

54
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,060
Leave the home to your wife.

55
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,660
Everything you're saying

56
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,060
is already making me feel pressured.

57
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,610
Honestly, I might not

58
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:13,900
be able to handle it.

59
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,540
Actually, I feel

60
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,380
that a person

61
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,456
doesn't necessarily have to have a companion.

62
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,780
Like the ones

63
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,340
I've encountered.

64
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,050
Many were once deeply in love as couples.

65
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,490
But in the end, for various reasons, they...

66
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:33,890
I'm afraid.

67
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,700
Love requires courage.

68
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,490
Do you have that courage?

69
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,250
Alright, alright.

70
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,900
Let's not talk about this anymore.

71
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,810
Okay, okay, okay.

72
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:47,660
Not talking about it.

73
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,460
You don't necessarily have to marry.

74
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,860
But you need someone by your side.

75
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,020
Do you know what's...

76
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,020
Zhang, what's in your thermos?

77
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:56,900
Oh.

78
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,140
There's chicken soup inside.

79
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,140
Chicken soup? Be careful not to spill it.

80
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:00,980
It won't spill.

81
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,050
Do you know

82
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,450
what's the scariest thing in life?

83
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,540
Growing old without a companion.

84
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,700
Living alone forever.

85
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:20,930
This chicken soup

86
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:21,930
smells so good.

87
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,490
How long did you simmer it?

88
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,020
Two hours.

89
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,440
It must be packed with flavor.

90
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,090
Here, have some.

91
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,460
- Thank you, Zhang.
- Thanks, Zhang.

92
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,620
There's more if you finish it.

93
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,460
Help yourselves.

94
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,340
Whoever marries you

95
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,660
would be so lucky.

96
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,810
Cooking skills alone aren't enough.

97
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,370
This soup is really good.

98
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,700
My mom's a culinary master.

99
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,210
Her level is about the same as this.

100
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,520
Bring two bowls here.

101
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,380
More people over there?

102
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,420
Help yourselves.

103
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,420
Come on, have some soup.

104
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,130
Here.

105
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,010
Drink it.

106
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,570
Thanks.

107
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,930
It's delicious. I spent two hours making it.

108
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,220
It's okay, Ding Dang.

109
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,060
Go ahead, drink.

110
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,250
Your stomach's protesting already.

111
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,580
That just means it's hungry.

112
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,300
Drink it. It's really good.

113
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,330
Have some.

114
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:56,980
How is it?

115
00:06:58,410 --> 00:06:59,250
It's great.

116
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,050
These two girls...

117
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,850
They're the victims.

118
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,220
What happened?

119
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,300
Well...

120
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:21,430
The soup is really tasty.

121
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,620
Can I have another bowl?

122
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,330
Xu.

123
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:36,770
Save me some, okay?

124
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,900
I've got a rough idea of the situation.

125
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,930
I don't think it's a good idea

126
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,370
for Lin to stay here tonight.

127
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,140
His blood pressure is high,

128
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:50,980
and he's been

129
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,250
sleeping poorly.

130
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,900
What if it spikes to 180 tomorrow?

131
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,370
We'd have to send him to the hospital.

132
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,490
How about this idea?

133
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:57,770
The two of us

134
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,220
take the girls home,

135
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,900
if you're okay with that.

136
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:02,660
She's currently

137
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,810
the key witness.

138
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,020
Isn't it your police's duty

139
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,780
to protect witnesses?

140
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,610
Look at her right now.

141
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:10,930
What can you get from her?

142
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,400
She's been through such a shock.

143
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,780
What she needs most now is warmth and care.

144
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,140
If a normal person walked in here,

145
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,340
they'd be shaking, let alone her.

146
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,250
Right? Lin and I

147
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:22,810
will take her home together.

148
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,220
We'll help her clean up.

149
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,220
Let her have a bath and get some rest.

150
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,930
After a good sleep, she might be normal.

151
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,440
If she's normal, you can question her.

152
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,626
This way, you'll solve the case.

153
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,010
Taking her home is not a good idea.

154
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,850
What's the problem? I'll be there.

155
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,770
This really goes against the rules.

156
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,370
Do you even know who I am?

157
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,770
I'm the captain of the joint defense team

158
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,130
of our community committee.

159
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,050
My armband was issued

160
00:08:49,074 --> 00:08:50,274
by the local police station.

161
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,750
I'm a legitimate grassroots cadre.

162
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,100
I understand your rules and protocols.

163
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,010
Don't worry.

164
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,970
Alright? It's settled then.

165
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,020
Okay?

166
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,020
Okay, but...

167
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,180
You must report her condition on time.

168
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,300
No problem.

169
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,140
How often?

170
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,100
Ideally, every eight hours.

171
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,490
But if you can't get up,

172
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,100
- 12 hours is fine too.
- Eight hours.

173
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,490
Got it. Don't worry about it.

174
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:20,610
Can you do that?

175
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,770
For your sake, I have to do it.

176
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,730
Let's go, hurry up!

177
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,490
Hurry up! Go.

178
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,570
Are you sure this is okay?

179
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,020
Miss,

180
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,250
pack your things and come home with me.

181
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,090
Let's go.

182
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,300
I still feel this isn't right.

183
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,890
Why? What's wrong with it?

184
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,820
- It's inconvenient.
- No worries. I'm here.

185
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,980
- Ding Dang.
- Listen to me.

186
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,770
Your blood pressure is already high.

187
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,130
Your back isn't doing well either.

188
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,100
Go back home with them first.

189
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,070
If you get sick, who'll care for you?

190
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:49,850
I won't, anyway.

191
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:51,890
You shouldn't do like this.

192
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:54,490
Hurry up, go now.

193
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:58,890
Let's go.

194
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,540
Come on, follow me.

195
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,060
Alright,

196
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,700
we're home.

197
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,420
Miss,

198
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,220
staying at his place

199
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,580
is just like being at home.

200
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:28,850
Don't be afraid.

201
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,850
Stop following him around like this.

202
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,610
He hasn't even gone to the restroom in hours.

203
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:36,940
Come on, come with me.

204
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,780
Come over here.

205
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,900
Hurry up and use the bathroom.

206
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,690
Come on.

207
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,100
You'll sleep in this room tonight.

208
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:48,980
Go pack up your things.

209
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,580
I'll be here in a while.

210
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,180
Go ahead.

211
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,220
How will we sleep tonight?

212
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,220
You brought her back, so you decide.

213
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,650
It's not appropriate

214
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,820
for you alone to stay here with her.

215
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,770
I have to make a sacrifice.

216
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:16,610
I'll come here.

217
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,460
I sleep in your bedroom

218
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,460
and you manage on the sofa.

219
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:21,820
Let her

220
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,370
- sleep in that room.
- No way.

221
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,700
Why not? She's already inside.

222
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,460
So what?

223
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,650
You want to sleep with me?

224
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,060
Just send her away.

225
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:36,980
How could we do that?

226
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,770
That means throwing her into trouble.

227
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,510
Let's talk about it later.

228
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:42,260
Alright, go ahead.

229
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,250
Come here.

230
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,460
Help me lift the mattress.

231
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,830
I'll move it over for her.

232
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,420
Don't be scared.

233
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,700
Let me take a look.

234
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,490
This...

235
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,210
This...

236
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,300
These people are unbelievably cruel.

237
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:21,940
Let me take a look.

238
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,060
Oh my goodness.

239
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,940
You have suffered a lot.

240
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,180
It's truly heartbreaking.

241
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,250
These people are just...

242
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:50,430
Are you feeling sleepy?

243
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,780
Take a nap.

244
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,180
Don't be afraid.

245
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,770
We are staying outside.

246
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,180
Just relax and get some rest.

247
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,340
If you feel sore, try sleeping on your side,

248
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:05,580
or lie on your stomach.

249
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:06,780
Alright?

Dad.

255
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,190
You love steamed buns?

256
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,740
You're awake!

257
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,140
Get up and have breakfast.

258
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,700
You're up so early.

259
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,330
Ding Dang got up early today.

260
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,010
Try her eggs and see how they taste.

261
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,240
No thanks, high blood sugar.

262
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,180
Alright.

263
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,020
Thanks.

264
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:56,420
Then just have a steamed bun.

265
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,290
How's the egg?

266
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,250
It's overcooked.

267
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,090
Overcooked?

268
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:01,930
You fried it too long.

269
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,490
Add some water next time.

270
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:04,530
Water can make it softer.

271
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,370
Alright.

272
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,250
The girl cooked it.

273

She's really hardworking.

274
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,660
She got up early to make breakfast.

275
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,330
Slept well here, right?

276
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,160
You look much better today.

277
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,140
Not bad.

278
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,340
I'm done eating.

279
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,460
I want to ask you something.

280
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,380
That night,

281
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,340
those two men,

282
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,540
can you remember

283
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,020
their looks

284
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,670
or the license plate number?

285
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,700
It's fine, it's fine.

286
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,820
Do you remember now?

287
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,540
Alright, stop asking.

288
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,660
Let her eat in peace.

289
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,100
It's okay now, really.

290
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,180
Go ahead and eat.

291
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,740
Don't ask anymore.

292
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:10,900
Okay, okay, okay.

293
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,980
Alright.

294
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,700
I won't ask.

295
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:14,940
Hurry up and eat.

296
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,300
Go ahead.

297
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,340
Thank you.

What are you thinking about?

00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,380
Director Yang, I...

301
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,060
I want to ask you something.

302
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,340
It's about...

303
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,500
Lin.

304
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,100
Do you know

305
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,380
why he came to our bureau?

306
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,460
Lin.

307
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,460
It's been almost ten years.

308
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,300
Back then,

309
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,220
I was just a Section Chief.

310
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,220
I remember the Provincial Department

311
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,340
transferred him directly here.

312
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:23,980
Why do you ask?

313
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,300
The Provincial Department, huh?

314
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,060
Yeah, that's right.

315
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,740
Why are you asking?

316
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,300
Nothing, I was just curious.

317
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,460
Focus on work. Don't think about Lin.

318
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,300
(We're going to buy groceries.
Wait for us when you wake up.)

Slow down. Wait for me.

323
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,300
Be gentle.

324
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,980
That girl's probably still asleep.

325
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,860
Here.

326
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,700
Let me take it.

327
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,060
Why has she been sleeping so long?

328
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,460
Ding Dang.

329
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,820
Ding Dang, time to wake up.

330
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,540
How about dumplings today?

331
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,420
Alright, alright, I'll handle it.

332
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,380
Don't stay here.

333
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,540
Don't worry, leave it to me.

334
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,780
- Go outside.
- Okay.

335

336

Let me help you.

337
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,580
You're helping me?

338
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,980
Put this in the fridge.

339
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:24,900
I found these pieces.

340
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,010
They're almost put together.

341
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,300
Alright.

342
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,310
I'll go get the camera now

343
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,420
and take photos of them.

344
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,900
Then we can tidy this up

345
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,380
- and document this.
- Got it.

346
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,740
Watch your step.

347
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:34,900
It's steep here.

348
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,300
Ms. Chen,

349
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,820
the items from Yu County Museum

350
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,760
have all been delivered.

351
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,340
Coming.

352
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,420
- Take them over there.
- Sure.

353
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,420
Let's go.

354
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,260
Oh my gosh.

355
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,140
Put it here.

356
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,100
This is the replica tripod

357
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,620
taken from Yu County Museum.

358
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,540
This is the one from Zhou Daye' house.

359
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,860
Aren't they identical?

360
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,540
You said this tripod is

361
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,220
key to the Longevity Ritual.

362
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,100
What exactly does it do?

363
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,700
Honestly, I'm still not sure

364
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,900
what role it plays.

365
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,860
I think we need to study this further.

366
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,820
But in the Shang Dynasty, the tripods

367
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,980
were used to cook sacrificial offerings.

368
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:30,880
For instance,

369
00:24:30,904 --> 00:24:33,316
the lowest-level offering was livestock.

370
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,780
If it was a higher-level offering,

371
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,260
it would be a person.

372
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,820
Someone of high status,

373
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,260
or someone young.

374
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,830
Many such tripods were found in Yin Ruins.

375
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,260
So,

376
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,660
I suspect the missing body parts

377
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,620
of those girls you can't find...

378
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,050
Is it possible that...

379
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,300
Are you sure?

380
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,340
This is the mark on the back

381
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,420
of Ding Dang whom you rescued.

382
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:19,940
Look at this wound.

383
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,460
I thought it was strange at the time.

384
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,060
Don't you think

385
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,150
it resembles something?

386
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,370
Definitely a knife wound.

387
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,660
But look closely at the stroke pattern.

388
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,700
It seems like

389
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,340
there's a missing stroke.

390
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:45,460
It resembles the ancient script for "Sheng".

391
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,180
"Sheng"?

392
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,340
As in "Xi Sheng".

393
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,940
It means they were

394
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,260
not only used in rituals

395
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,740
like livestock

396
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,300
and also branded

397
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,140
with a mark.

398
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:03,020
The character "Sheng" in ancient texts

399
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,660
didn't mean livestock.

400
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,060
It referred to sacrificial cattle.

401
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,660
Sacrificial humans

402
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,140
were called "human offerings".

403
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,420
Humans were considered the highest offering,

404
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,740
dedicated to so-called gods.

405
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,340
That's just horrifying!

406
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,420
This could give me nightmares tonight.

407
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:25,800
These two tripods

408
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,740
are both counterfeits.

409
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,640
They're not authentic.

410
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,540
I wish I could figure out a way

411
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,300
to unlock that girl's memories.

412
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,060
She's been deeply affected.

413
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,740
Now she can't say a word.

414
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,420
I might know someone who can help.

415
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,280
Back in college,

416
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,950
she volunteered at the psychology center

417
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:49,596
for four years.

418
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,520
Sounds good.

419
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,380
Where is she? Let's find her now.

420
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,220
I minored in psychology.

421
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,860
You?!

422
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,440
Do archaeologists need to study psychology?

423
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,740
Not really.

424
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,420
Just a personal interest.

425
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:10,820
Alright.

426
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,500
Ding Dang,

427
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,580
do you have any family left?

428
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,540
Kids losing their moms are like grass.

429
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,860
You're just like me.

430
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,620
Both of us are all alone.

431
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,660
Are you two

432
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,340
not a couple?

433
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,780
No, we're not.

434
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,620
I've been divorced for years.

435
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,970
I don't have any children.

436
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,860
As for Mr. Lin...

437
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,740
Carrot beef dumplings,

438
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,740
my absolute favorite.

439
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,940
I know it's your favorite too.

440
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,340
Ding Dang suggested this filling.

441
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,180
You love it too, huh?

442
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,460
Ding Dang,

443
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,780
after all this is over,

444
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,220
what are your plans?

445
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:10,380
You should learn a skill.

446
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,380
It's necessary to have some skills

447
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,380
to stand on your own in this society.

448
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,000
Otherwise, how will you make a living?

449
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,020
Right?

450
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,100
What kind of idea is this?

451
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,660
She's still young.

452
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,800
She should focus on studying.

453
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,080
I'll help you find a school.

454
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:25,810
Let her study for a few years first

455
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:27,100
and then learn a skill afterward.

456
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,220
Education is the right path.

457
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,100
I... I don't have any money.

458
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,500
Money is not the issue.

459
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,180
Money is not the issue?

460
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,420
Then you'll pay for it?

461
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,300
Fine, fine, fine.

462
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,310
- He's bragging.
- Fine.

463
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,020
Money is not the issue.

464
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,700
Like you're so loaded or something.

465
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,780
Don't fall for his nonsense.

466
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:53,940
He has no money.

467
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,100
Or how could he live here?

468
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,980
Ding Dang, take a rest for now.

469
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,620
I'll go with Mr. Lin to get you something.

470
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,300
Alright.

471
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,200
You don't need to come along.

472
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,580
I'm getting things for women's use.

473
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,740
You can't come.

474
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:35,860
Dad.

475
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,200
Where did you get this?

476
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,900
Don't mess with my stuff.

477
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,540
Got it.

478
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,700
Dad,

479
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,760
I want to show you something.

480
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:37,020
(Certificate of Honor)

481
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,300
I knew you'd remember my birthday, Dad.

482
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,140
This is my favorite flavor.

483
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,300
Strawberry and mango.

484
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,460
Dad bought it for you.

485
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,300
Thanks, Dad.

486
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,140
Thanks, Mom.

487
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,660
Apply some cake before eating.

488
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,540
I'm an adult now.

489
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,740
Yeah, 18 already.

490
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,580
You've grown up now.

491
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,380
You've saved so many people.

492
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,820
But you couldn't save our daughter.

493
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,100
My daughter is gone.

494
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,460
I can't go on like this.

495
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,580
Let's divorce.

496
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,780
Stop digging! Stop, stop!

497
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,260
I said stop digging!

498
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,900
Hurry and get an excavator.

499
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,420
I need to solve this case.

500
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,740
Are you hiding something from me?

501
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,730
I want to solve the case.

502
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,180
Do you understand?!

503
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,940
In that file,

504
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,940
there's another deceased recorded.

505
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,020
No identity was stated.

506
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,480
Lin,

507
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,140
we've been through thick and thin together.

508
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,860
I think we should be honest with each other.

509
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,020
We can't just keep it hidden.

510
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:40,420
Mr. Shi,

511
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,260
it's me.

512
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:42,700
It's been a long time.

513
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,780
Are you busy right now?

514
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,100
Not at all.

515
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,020
Xiao,

516
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,300
what made you decide

517
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,780
to call me today?

518
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,970
How have you been lately?

519
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,460
Working on a big case at the moment.

520
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,460
Mr. Shi, I want

521
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,420
to ask you something.

522
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:00,780
What's it?

523
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,260
As long as it doesn't break any rules,

524
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,180
I'm happy to help.

525
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,620
There's an old officer in my team.

526
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,930
