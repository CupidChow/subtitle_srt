3
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:16,610
Cui Haitao,

4
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,100
you once joined a tomb raiding gang.

5
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,580
What was your relation to Wang Bingde?

6
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:24,610
Nothing between us.

7
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:29,730
Look,

8
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,860
I've served my time

9
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,210
and paid my dues.

10
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,580
Now I'm

11
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:37,730
clean.

12
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:41,980
He just came to eat.

13
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:01,610
Cui Haitao!

14
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,010
Captain! Captain! Captain!

15
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,130
- Captain!
- Xu Xiao.

16
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,010
Don't stop me.

17
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,330
Xu Xiao, what are you doing?

18
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:10,330
Come out here.

19
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,620
Xu Xiao.

20
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,550
Xu Xiao,

21
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,660
stay calm.

22
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,650
I get how you feel.

23
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,020
I know, but Cui Haitao...

24
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,340
Don't give me the "but".

25
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,360
Lin Guoqiang's daughter...

26
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,700
I understand your feelings.

27
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,020
My bad, I was too hasty.

28
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,170
I'll handle myself better.

29
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,100
No worries. Can I go in now?

30
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,100
Trust me, I'll get it together.

31
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,290
Go ahead.

32
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,770
Keep your cool.

33
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,050
No problem.

34
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:57,140
(Interrogation Room)

35
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,660
Start talking.

36
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,060
How long have you been at this?

37
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,130
Seven or eight years.

38
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,210
How many kids do you have?

39
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,780
Two.

40
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,180
One's seven.

41
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,420
One's five.

42
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,780
A son and a daughter?

43
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,200
Does this business make money?

44
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,560
It's so-so.

45
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,460
In a year,

46
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,980
I make around 100,000.

47
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,860
So your life

48
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,300
is going pretty well.

49
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,060
Just okay.

50
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,300
Thanks to my wife

51
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,460
for not minding.

52
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,820
Have you ever thought

53
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,100
you'll lose it all

54
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,420
overnight?

55
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,740
Like

56
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,140
tomorrow?

57
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,700
It's not that I don't want to say.

58
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,420
I'm just afraid to say.

59
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,820
Xiang is ruthless.

60
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,580
These people

61
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,740
can do anything.

62
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,180
Who's Xiang?

63
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,260
Cui Haitao, listen up.

64
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,940
If you tell me the truth,

65
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,740
I can keep your family safe.

66
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,420
Why should I trust you?

67
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,980
Because you're here now,

68
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,350
you have no choice but to trust me.

69
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,140
Got it?

70
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,420
There's no way out for you.

71
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,640
If you don't speak the truth,

72
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,100
you'll stay stuck here.

73
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,620
Xiang is

74
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,500
Wang Bingde.

75
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,100
His real name is

76
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:28,940
Wang Xiang.

77
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:34,940
Jiahei,

78
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,700
there's nothing here.

79
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,940
It's all been cleared out, right?

80
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,220
Keep looking.

81
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,700
What are you hiding?

82
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,580
Nothing.

83
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,300
Found anything good?

84
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,260
Nothing.

85
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,140
What are you hiding?

86
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,020
Nothing at all.

87
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:10,950
Keeping it to yourself?

88
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:11,860
Who's keeping anything?

89
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:12,980
You've got me wrong.

90
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,860
Really, nothing.

91
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,140
Buddy,

92
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,180
you're breaking the rules.

93
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,060
What rules?

94
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,140
We share everything, the three of us.

95
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:21,980
What rules?!

96
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,740
Everyone earns their keep here.

97
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,100
Finder's keepers, right?

98
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,180
Everyone earns their keep?

99
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,060
Exactly.

100
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,440
Everyone earns their keep, huh?

101
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,260
- Wang Xiang.
- Don't act recklessly.

102
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,140
Follow the rules.

103
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,400
Help him finish me off, huh?

104
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:35,760
Soon he'll be after you too.

105
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,780
Good buddy.

106
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:52,980
Good buddy.

107
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,660
In my younger days,

108
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,340
I once worked with them.

109
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,300
Later on,

110
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,780
I spent three years in jail.

111
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,460
After getting out,

112
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,220
I worked at Wang Bingde's site.

113
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,140
Eventually he

114
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,940
brought me into their gang.

115
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,020
What's your role in this gang?

116
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,380
Tomb blasting.

117
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,020
Few know this skill.

118
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,060
Wang Bingde taught me himself.

119
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,220
I'm just a peripheral member,

120
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,270
mainly handling technical stuff.

121
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,340
Does Wang Bingde handle tomb blasting too?

122
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,860
No,

123
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,780
he's the underboss,

124
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,100
a strategist.

125
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,420
How long have you been doing this?

126
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,180
For quite a while now.

127
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,740
Then,

128
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,700
something happened.

129
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,140
I felt like

130
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,420
this gang was a bit...

131
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,620
a bit twisted.

132
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,540
So I left.

133
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,220
What made you

134
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,660
leave the gang?

135
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,660
Hei...

136
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,540
Zhou Jiahei

137
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,940
unearthed a wet corpse

138
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,420
and found many bamboo slips.

139
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,540
Come on. Hurry up!

140
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,060
Clear everything off the table.

141
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,950
- On it!
- Okay!

142
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,300
Uncle, this is a wet corpse.

143
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,660
Why did you bring it back?

144
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,980
I haven't seen a non-decaying

145
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,300
wet corpse in years.

146
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,380
Quick, quick, quick.

147
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,300
Master,

148
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,460
can this sell for money?

149
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,180
Many people want it.

150
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,420
It's very useful.

151
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:48,900
Come.

152
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,980
This is...?

153
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,420
What's it used for?

154
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,940
I've been seeking a secret.

155
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,660
A huge secret.

156
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,660
Worth more than hundreds of tombs.

157
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,900
Help me check this character.

158
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,260
See that? This one.

159
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,340
Daming.

160
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,060
Fell asleep?

161
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,500
Get the dictionary.

162
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,420
This character.

163
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,420
Where to turn, you fool?

164
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,700
Isn't that the character?

165
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,420
On this bamboo slip,

166
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,660
he discovered

167
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,130
the secret to immortality

168
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,660
buried in a nearby tomb.

169
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,820
Later on,

170
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,660
he took us

171
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,540
to Yu County and excavated the tomb.

172
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,180
In that ancient tomb,

173
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,700
it's said a monarch was buried.

174
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,060
The tomb had water seepage,

175
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,380
making it unsafe.

176
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,100
The tomb passage

177
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,100
was flooded,

178
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,380
which prevented further looting

179
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,760
and protected many cultural relics.

180
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,900
We dared not go down,

181
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,060
but he wouldn't listen.

182
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,740
He went down alone.

183
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,820
I don't know what happened inside.

184
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,700
He seemed crazy

185
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,100
after he came up.

186
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,180
Dad...

187
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,420
Dad?

188
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,540
Uncle?

189
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,420
What's wrong with you?

190
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,180
Oh no!

191
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,540
He was possessed.

192
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,300
Hurry up! Get the black dog's blood.

193
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,820
How dare you!

194
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,020
You were possessed.

195
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,020
Sorry, uncle.

196
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,900
Uncle.

197
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,570
What's wrong with you, Jiahei?

198
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:34,900
Immortal Arts!

199
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,460
You brat!

200
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,980
I'm not angry today.

201
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,620
How many tortoise shells did Zhou Jiahei get?

202
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,180
One piece, I guess.

203
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,460
Are you sure?

204
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,540
Not really.

205
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,700
It's been too long.

206
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,940
Does he have more?

207
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,020
Go on.

208
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,420
Later,

209
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,700
he went home

210
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,620
and locked himself in a room

211
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,500
for a whole three months.

212
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,820
He said he wanted

213
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,170
to decipher the Immortal Arts.

214
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,900
Back then,

215
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,940
only his son Zhou Daye was with him.

216
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,780
Daye,

217
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,060
check this character.

218
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,260
Half a year later,

219
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,100
he did...

220
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,220
actually

221
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,020
killed a college girl

222
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,620
and dismembered her.

223
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,340
In our line of work,

224
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,270
it's usually clean and precise.

225
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,860
We avoid bloodshed.

226
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:07,740
But he...

227
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,220
Wang Bingde said

228
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:14,820
he was possessed.

229
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,340
That tortoise shell he took

230
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,140
from the tomb might be cursed,

231
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,740
which is able

232
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,860
to cloud one's mind.

233
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,380
It details the method of immortality.

234
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:26,900
What's the method?

235
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,420
Sacrifice women,

236
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,580
and worship dark spirits.

237
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:32,940
It's called

238
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,580
Immortality Ritual.

239
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,900
If it really worked,

240
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,580
why would the monarch lie in a tomb?

241
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,380
Go on.

242
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,540
After they killed someone.

243
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,280
Soon after,

244
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:53,340
the police found them.

245
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,980
Wang Bingde suggested

246
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,620
offering a million

247
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,500
to bribe the detective captain.

248
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,460
But he

249
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,340
firmly refused,

250
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,420
and wanted justice.

251
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,580
Afterwards...

252
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,020
They captured the captain's daughter, right?

253
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,580
What does he say?

254
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,260
No compromise.

255
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,780
So great!

256
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,020
So great!

257
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,620
Zhou Jiahei went mad.

258
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,490
After the captain refused him,

259
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,340
he knew it meant his end.

260
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,620
But,

261
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,260
before his time was up,

262
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,380
he wanted to teach the captain a lesson.

263
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,460
Dad,

264
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,420
let's leave together.

265
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,260
Exit from the south.

266
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,260
No one will find us.

267
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,740
I can't leave.

268
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,700
You two go.

269
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,500
I'll handle this.

270
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,030
Only in this way will you both be safe.

271
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,580
Daye.

272
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:06,940
Dad.

273
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,340
Daye,

274
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,580
live well.

275
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,100
I've taught you all I can.

276
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,780
You must continue this path.

277
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,660
The immortality technique

278
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,700
is our family's legacy.

279
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:21,900
Remember that.

280
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,540
Dad,

281
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,340
I remember.

282
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,020
- Xiang.
- Jiahei.

283
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,060
Promise me

284
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,260
to look after Daye for me.

285
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:35,940
He's impulsive

286
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,500
and grew up without a mom.

287
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:39,940
When things happen,

288
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,020
guide him often.

289
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,620
Don't worry, Jiahei.

290
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,700
In the future, if I have food,

291
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,100
Daye won't go hungry.

292
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,620
I'm relieved.

293
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,540
Leave here.

294
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,860
Go.

295
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:57,820
Come on!

296
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,580
Just go!

297
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,140
Dad!

298
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,460
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

299
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,500
So great!

300
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,260
Being a great person comes at a cost.

301
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:38,940
So

302
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,460
he ended the girl himself,

303
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,180
and drew a cross

304
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,420
on her eyes.

305
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,660
What's the meaning

306
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,100
of that mark?

307
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,860
It's Zhou Jiahei's signature.

308
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,780
Since the day I met him,

309
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,020
he told me

310
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,740
not to look into his eyes.

311
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,340
Wang Bingde, the gang's underboss,

312
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,780
how did he evade

313
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,660
the police back then?

314
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,340
Not only is he meticulous in thought,

315
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,580
but he was also a sanda champion.

316
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,020
Zhou Jiahei knew

317
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,300
trouble would come.

318
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,020
So he kept Wang Bingde hidden,

319
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,960
just for entrusting his son

320
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,060
to him in the future.

321
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,140
What's wrong with your eye?

322
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,100
Haitao, you're here!

323
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,860
Master, these past months,

324
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,820
where have you been?

325
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,500
Couldn't find you.

326
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,860
Just in the city,

327
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,740
laying low.

328
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,130
Haven't eaten, right? Get in.

329
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,220
Let's grab a bite.

330
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,220
Not in a rush.

331
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,580
I came to ask you something.

332
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,140
Jiahei was gone.

333
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,220
Now Daye is in charge.

334
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,660
We are thinking

335
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,780
we will focus on business, no fieldwork.

336
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,780
Good.

337
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,180
But the former members

338
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,660
are all gone.

339
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,660
I was wondering if you

340
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,020
would like to come back

341
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,180
and handle the fieldwork.

342
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,780
Your skills are impressive.

343
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,740
No one can match your skill

344
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,940
in tomb blasting.

345
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,540
Master,

346
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,780
it's too risky.

347
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,580
I

348
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,060
don't want to do it anymore.

349
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,940
From what you're saying,

350
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,820
you look down on me?

351
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,340
No, no, that's not it.

352
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,140
That's not what I mean.

353
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,220
- I really...
- Shut up.

354
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,260
What else can you do?

355
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,940
Always talking nonsense.

356
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,460
Apologize to Daye.

357
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,220
Let's pretend we didn't hear

358
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,420
what you just said.

359
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,700
Master, it's not nonsense.

360
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,860
I

361
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,700
have a girlfriend now.

362
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,860
We are preparing to open a restaurant

363
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,860
in our hometown.

364
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,620
It seems like

365
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,060
you had this planned all along,

366
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,370
ready to disband, right?

367
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,700
Well,

368
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,460
it's a pity to waste your skills.

369
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,620
I have no other way.

370
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,140
Have you made up your mind?

371
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,300
Alright.

372
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,940
I can't force you.

373
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,460
I have my own business.

374
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,980
I can't stop you from yours, right?

375
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,500
Master...

376
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,940
You can run your small diner.

377
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,190
When we need you here,

378
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,500
you just blow up a tomb

379
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,300
to earn extra money. Isn't that fine?

380
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:53,900
Well,

381
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,260
hmm,

382
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,340
master,

383
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,660
I want

384
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,580
to quit completely.

385
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,020
I'm done with it.

386
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,780
Are you sure?

387
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,860
I'm sure.

388
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,220
But you're different

389
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,700
from the peripheral members.

390
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,180
You know too much.

391
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,380
Well, Daye,

392
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,260
master,

393
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,500
I won't say a word.

394
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,460
I'm tight-lipped.

395
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,380
You know that.

396
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,260
Really?

397
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,300
Mr. Wang.

398
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,180
Why not

399
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,620
follow the rules?

400
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,700
Just bury him in a tomb.

401
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,380
- Daye, Daye.
- Master, please don't.

402
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,820
Haitao's been with us for years.

403
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:36,900
Show me some respect.

404
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,060
Master, can you speak for me?

405
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:39,940
Haitao,

406
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,260
you're my apprentice.

407
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,460
I really can't bear it.

408
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,180
But there are rules.

409
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,980
Or the team won't be obedient.

410
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:47,940
Master...

411
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:48,940
Just one eye.

412
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,700
No, Master, please.

413
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,300
Daye, Daye.

414
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,700
Guys, please don't.

415
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,660
Please.

416
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,780
I won't say a word. Trust me.

417
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,500
Losing one of your eyes

418
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,470
is better than being buried.

419
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,340
In this world,

420
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,820
what goes around comes around.

421
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,780
These people have no limits.

422
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,860
I'm really scared.

423
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,690
Did Wang Bingde ever mention

424
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,200
how many people

425
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,640
the Immortality Ritual requires?

426
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:47,100
Seems he did mention it.

427
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,540
At least five

428
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,460
once.

429
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,260
It must be done in 100 days.

430
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:57,950
Complete the foundation

431
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,340
within 100 days.

432
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,540
Kill five people

433
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,620
once?

434
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,860
Right.

435
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,660
If once isn't enough,

436
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,820
it has to be done several times.

437
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:27,100
(Tripod, one piece)

438
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,260
What's wrong, Senior?

439
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,580
This tripod...

440
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,780
Let me study it.

441
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,500
You've been studying it for a while.

442
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,580
Focus on your own stuff.

443
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,610
Why do you care what I do?

444
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:43,980
Alright, alright.

445
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,260
(Weight (kg) 4.8)

446
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,900
(Weight 4.0kg)

447
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,740
Don't you find this tripod

448
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,420
a bit odd?

449
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:12,980
I don't find it odd.

450
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,470
I think you're a bit odd.

451
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,460
So,

452
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,500
you are very likely to not graduate.

453
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:24,340
I'll just work here forever.

454
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,620
Kong,

455
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,500
look here.

456
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,660
Look here.

457
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,500
(Fang Qi)

458
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:16,860
Fang Qi.

459
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:18,980
Is it fake?

460
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,300
Excuse me. Is Fang Qi here?

461
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:03,040
He's in the kiln over there.

462
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,060
Thanks.

463
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:23,940
Fang Qi.

464
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,540
You are...?

465
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,460
I'm Chen Nan.

466
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,500
Last year, my friend took me

467
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,020
to have some bronze mirrors made here.

468
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:33,900
Do you remember?

469
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,180
I have a vague memory.

470
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,540
Here's the thing.

471
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,540
I have an item here.

472
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,850
Could you take a look?

473
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,060
Please, come inside.

474
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:42,940
Sure.

475
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,300
Please have a look.

476
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,460
This tripod

477
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,740
was a gift from a friend.

478
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,020
Is it your work?

479
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,900
Yes, it's mine.

480
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,660
No doubt, my mark's here.

481
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,060
Is this made

482
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,340
from the same material as the real one?

483
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,500
Pretty much.

484
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,900
The same material ratio,

485
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,780
six to one ratio.

486
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:14,930
How about the size?

487
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,100
Also the same.

488
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,920
But the real one is one jin lighter.

489
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,020
Haven't you weighed it?

490
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,940
I make crafts,

491
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,500
not selling meat.

492
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,420
Why do you think

493
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,540
the real one's lighter?

494
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,220
Lighter?

495
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,020
It shouldn't be, right?

496
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,780
Unless

497
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,660
this tripod

498
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,580
has a compartment.

499
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,700
Ancient tripods often have

500
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,020
compartments.

501
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,700
Now some high-quality replicas

502
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,080
is also made with a compartment.

503
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,160
Are you sure it's a compartment?

504
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,900
Well, if you have the real one,

505
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,120
just use medical imaging on it,

506
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,140
and you'll know.

507
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:56,940
But,

508
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,500
why would it have a compartment?

509
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,590
In the past, some had air pockets

510
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,430
left during casting,

511
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,300
and some contained

512
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,540
metal objects

513
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,500
just to add weight,

514
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,960
making it feel substantial.

515
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,500
But the real one is lighter than this.

516
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,460
Do you think there's any other reason?

517
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,580
I really don't know.

518
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,380
You have to admit

519
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,500
this tripod is really well-made.

520
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,900
Chen Nan,

521
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,460
I have one even better than this.

522
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,420
Let me show it to you.

523
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,100
Mom, I might not make it home this week.

524
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,220
No need to keep going back and forth.

525
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,460
It's alright.

526
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,400
Take care of yourself, okay?

527
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,030
Don't just eat cup noodles.

528
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,380
Have something nutritious.

529
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,220
It's been a while since I had
instant noodles.

530
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,340
Don't worry, I'm eating well.

531
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,460
You're not getting any younger.

532
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,980
Time to find a girlfriend.

533
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,360
You should settle down.

534
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,100
Your dad and I

535
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,300
want a grandkid soon.

536
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,100
You,

537
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,060
please don't mention that man.

538
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,620
He's your dad.

539
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,900
He cares about you.

540
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,380
I know that well.

541
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,380
He takes care of the family less.

542
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,300
Isn't it because he's busy with work?

543
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,820
When he's busy, he neglects home.

544
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,740
But son,

545
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,780
he does love you.

546
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,630
You should understand now.

547
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,540
Those dedicated to police work

548
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:01,220
rarely have time for family.

549
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,580
Make time

550
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,380
to visit your dad.

551
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,660
Alright,

552
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,260
I won't keep you.

553
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,300
I'll come back when I can.

554
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:14,580
Mom, you...

555
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:31,960
Xiaoxing, I've been looking for you.

556
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,500
So, how's it going?

557
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,780
Wang Bingde left at midnight,

558
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,880
so there were no witnesses.

559
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,940
And there are no cameras in that village.

560
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,020
But Dafei just mentioned

561
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:51,220
a villager lost a motorcycle

562
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,220
yesterday.

563
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,780
Yes.

564
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,060
While investigating,

565
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,300
we overheard villagers chatting.

566
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,020
We found the motorcycle's owner.

567
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,570
The time the motorcycle was lost

568
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:00,820
coincides with the time

569
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,780
Wang Bingde disappeared.

570
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,820
During our investigation,

571
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:05,140
the gas station camera

572
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,940
captured the motorcycle passing.

573
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,100
But the rider wore a helmet,

574
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,210
so we couldn't see the face.

575
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,660
Judging by the build,

576
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,640
it resembles Wang Bingde.

577
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:14,780
And from the direction he went,

578
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,100
he likely headed to Baoyang City.

579
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,380
Immediately notify the local police

580
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,180

Wang Bingde won't stay idle.

584
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:28,900
He might hunt again soon.

585
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,700
Got it.

586
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,290
Zheng, send me the video.

587
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:34,260
Quickly.

588
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,780
Captain, almost done.

589
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,790
All set, Captain Xu.

(Refueling Area-4,

591
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:48,980
Is this him?

592
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,860
Yes.

593
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:51,140
The one with the helmet.

594
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,500
How's Lin doing?

595
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,980
I've been busy since last night.

596
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,500
I haven't visited him yet.

597
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,500
(Ward 9)

598
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,080
He was doing well.

599
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,270
Since he started working with you,

600
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,160
he's completely worn out.

601
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:23,070
Sorry.

602
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,460
Zhang, thanks for your care.

603
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,910
You brought chicken soup again?

604
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,540
Turtle soup.

605
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,860
Hey, let me tell you.

606
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,100
I like this old man.

607
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:33,820
He's quite decent.

608
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,420
If you mess him up,

609
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,540
I won't let it go.

610
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:37,940
Alright, got it.

611
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,300
Is he awake yet?

612
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,740
Why doesn't he wake up?

613
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,620
Seriously.

619
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,220
help me find out

who borrowed this book last.

621

What do you want to check it for?

622
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,430
This book is relatively obscure.

623
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,860
I want to see who shares my interests,

624
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,740

625
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,020
