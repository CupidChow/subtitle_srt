3
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,500
Mr. Shi,

4
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,380
I want

5
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,420
to ask you something.

6
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,580
What's it?

7
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,060
As long as it doesn't break the rules,

8
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:11,980
I'm happy to help.

9
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,340
There's an old officer in my team.

10
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,710
His name is Lin Guoqiang.

11
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,450
About a decade ago,

12
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,260
he was transferred to the City Bureau's

13
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,040
Cultural Relics Unit

14
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,104
and then to the archives.

15
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,720
Now, he's working alongside me.

16
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,640
I want to know why he was

17
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,240
transferred to the City Bureau?

18
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,580
What kind of person was he before?

19
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,210
What happened to him?

20
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,140
What's wrong with him?

21
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,500
Nothing.

22
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,420
This transfer matter was indeed

23
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,940
handled by the Provincial Department.

24
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,260
The reason was his daughter's passing.

25
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,700
An accident.

26
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,100
It hit him really hard.

27
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,340
Because of this,

28
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,700
his wife divorced him.

29
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,760
She returned to her parents' home.

30
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,860
He applied for a transfer

31
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,970
to change a new environment.

32
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,780
Someone who handled it back then

33
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,420
kept reminding me

34
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,500
never

35
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,260
to bring this up in front of him.

36
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,420
Never.

37
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,180
But as far as I know,

38
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,980
he's a very competent officer.

39
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,260
About that,

40
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,100
you can rest assured.

41
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,780
What kind of accident

42
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,980
caused his daughter to be gone?

43
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:26,900
You better not ask about that.

44
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,300
Anyway, she's gone.

45
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,380
You've never raised a child,

46
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,780
so you might not understand his feelings.

47
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,300
In short,

48
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,140
you can think of him as someone

49
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,060
who's already lived through death.

50
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,580
Got it?

51
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,500
Alright, alright.

52
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,580
I get it now.

53
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,700
Thanks, Mr. Shi.

54
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,220
Why are you being polite with me?

55
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,180
Don't blame me for nagging.

56
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,620
But I want to ask

57
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,500
if You've been arguing with your dad

58
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,420
lately.

59
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,060
If you ask me...

60
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,460
Mr. Shi, I...

61
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,660
I need to take a call.

62
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,820
Bye.

63
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,100
We'll catch up later. Thank you.

64
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,020
Bye!

65
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,340
This kid!

66
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,340
I wish I could figure out a way

67
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,060
to unlock that girl's memories.

68
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,220
I might know someone who can help.

69
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,740
Where is she? Let's go find her now.

70
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,300
I minored in psychology.

71
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,380
She is currently in the early stages

72
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,180
of post-traumatic stress disorder.

73
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,460
She'll avoid painful memories

74
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,420
consciously or unconsciously.

75
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,680
This condition

76
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,980
takes at least three to four days

77
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,860
to alleviate.

78
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,300
Where's Tewu?

79
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,660
I didn't see it.

80
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,220
It's okay.

81
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,250
Don't shut the door tight.

82
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,124
Leave the window ajar.

83
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,160
It'll come back.

84
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,140
Your colleague is here.

85
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,700
Lin.

86
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,300
You're here.

87
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,900
Lie down in a position

88
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,460
that makes you feel comfortable.

89
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,300
We sit next to you and accompany you, okay?

90
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,020
Don't be scared.

91
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,740
Ms. Chen is a psychology expert.

92
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,580
She'll help you recall everything.

93
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,580
Could you two step out for now?

94
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,580
You should've let me know beforehand.

95
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,530
I could've been mentally prepared.

96
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,970
What if she gets triggered again?

97
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,060
We don't have much time left.

98
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,540
She's a key witness.

99
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,100
Spending time on her is worth it.

100
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,780
Lin,

101
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,540
as police officers,

102
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,900
we must constantly remind ourselves

103
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,140
not to bring personal emotion

104
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,540
into the cases we're handling.

105
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,580
What do you mean by that?

106
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,540
I'm just reminding you.

107
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,460
You're not thinking clearly right now.

108
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,700
Don't worry.

109
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,940
I won't let emotions cloud my judgment,

110
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,340
and I won't delay the investigation.

111
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,620
These scars weren't randomly made.

112
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,740
They form the oracle bone character "Sheng"

113
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,820
which means "livestock."

114
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,300
Ms. Chen told me about this.

115
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,020
Don't be nervous. We're just chatting.

116
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,700
So,

117
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,340
let's take it slow.

118
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,220
What does that person

119
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,580
look like?

120
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,620
You...

121
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,060
No need to feel pressured.

122
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,500
Just think about whatever comes to mind.

123
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,620
It's okay if you can't remember.

124
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,180
What do those people

125
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,300
look like?

126
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,860
Were they tall?

127
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,580
Were they fat or slim?

128
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,180
Can you tell me

129
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,740
where

130
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,500
they took you?

131
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,740
What did they do to you?

132
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,140
How did you manage to get away?

133
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,140
When you escaped,

134
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,580
where were you exactly?

135
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,780
What kind of surroundings was it?

136
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,940
Did you notice

137
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,180
anything unusual?

138
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,460
For example,

139
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,380
clothing,

140
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,900
shoes,

141
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,220
or anything distinctive?

142
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,820
She's incredibly brave.

143
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,170
A little girl was locked up

144
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,100
in the trunk

145
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,700
with a bag of corpses.

146
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,580
It's a miracle for her to survive.

147
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,260
From the timeline,

148
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,260
she seems to be the fourth victim.

149
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,620
Ding Dang is the fifth.

150
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,340
What confuses me is

151
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,860
why they didn't dispose of the body first

152
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,340
and then abduct Ding Dang.

153
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,820
Captain Xu, what's your take?

154
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,860
I think before they dumped the body,

155
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,180
they found their next target

156
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,980
and they just had a chance to do it.

157
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,540
To them, the order didn't matter.

158
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,070
The people they had set their sights on

159
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:53,780
were already dead.

160
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,580
They didn't care.

161
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,060
Does this lead help us?

162
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,020
Not much.

163
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,820
I do have an idea.

164
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,860
Recreate the scene.

165
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,500
There may be

166
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,740
other significant discoveries.

167
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,540
Alright, let's try.

168
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:13,940
No, we can't.

169
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,420
Why not?

170
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,100
It's too cruel to do that.

171
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,740
You two can discuss it.

172
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,580
I'll wait outside.

173
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:26,960
Delaying for a day

174
00:11:26,984 --> 00:11:28,236
may result in one more victim.

175
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,050
All you care about is solving the case.

176
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:30,900
Case! Case!

177
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,340
Can you show some compassion?

178
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,460
Compassion won't save the next victim.

179
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,500
It might even put us at risk.

180
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,220
If we lose our humanity,

181
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,820
that's even scarier.

182
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,860
Have you thought about her?

183
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,980
Take a little more rest.

184
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,860
Take it easy.

185
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,220
Give her two more days.

186
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,780
I'll try my best.

187
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:44,860
Tewu?

188
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,660
Tewu?

189
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,060
Come on.

190
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,500
Step on me to climb in.

191
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,700
Go ahead.

192
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,700
Only you can enter.

193
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,380
Take it slow.

194
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,980
Be careful.

195
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,300
Slow down.

196
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,920
I'll turn on the flashlight.

197
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,700
Tewu.

198
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,700
Tewu.

199
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,820
How've you been feeling these days?

200
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,630
Here's the situation.

201
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,700
Captain Xu and Ms. Chen

202
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,140
want to recreate the scene

203
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,820
with you.

204
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:34,940
This could help you regain some memories.

205
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,820
Of course, without your consent,

206
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,940
we wouldn't proceed.

207
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,690
What's a scene recreation?

208
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,540
It means

209
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,180
we'll have two officers

210
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,420
play the two men in black

211
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,980
you met that night

212
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,540
and repeat

213
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,400
their actions towards you.

214
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,580
Don't worry.

215
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,460
This won't actually harm you.

216
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,980
We hope the process

217
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,100
could trigger

218
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,060
some lingering memories.

219
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,780
Like

220
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,620
the suspect's

221
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,300
license plate number,

222
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,220
physical features.

223
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,460
Of course.

224
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,220
Without your consent,

225
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,380
we won't force you.

226
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,220
Are those people

227
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,260
still killing?

228
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,260
They've killed four girls already.

229
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,330
Originally, you were the fifth.

230
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,700
We suspect there'll be more victims.

231
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,910
We're racing against time.

232
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,460
Are they all girls like me?

233
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,620
Yes.

234
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,900
I have one condition.

235
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:03,940
Go ahead.

236
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,780
If I help you find

237
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,860
useful clues,

238
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,500
could I

239
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,820
stay and live here?

240
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,420
Well...

241
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,900
If I can't help you,

242
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,900
I'll just leave on my own.

243
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,020
Is this you?

244
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,580
Yes, it's me.

245
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,730
I'm going to ask you a few questions.

246
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,300
Answer them truthfully

247
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,000
and cooperate with my work.

248
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,500
Alright.

249
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,180
I'll be honest.

250
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,100
(Lin Guoqiang)

251
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,860
Hello?

252
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,780
Captain Xu,

253
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,020
she agreed.

254
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,580
Don't worry.

255
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,580
I'll handle everything.

256
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,820
I heard

257
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,420
that you write your wish on this note,

258
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,340
put it in a bottle, and it'll come true.

259
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,460
Well then,

260
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,620
wishing us

261
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,380
to make a lot of money,

262
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,980
and to be safe and healthy.

263
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,900
Do you plan

264
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,840
to do something else in the future?

265
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,020
I think this life is pretty good.

266
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,980
I don't know how to do anything else.

267
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,220
Eat it. It's getting cold.

268
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,260
Sounds good, sir.

269
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,460
Have a drink.

270
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,620
- Ten.
- Ten?

271
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,060
No, just five.

272
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:07,980
Eight.

273
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,780
(Suspect?)

274
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,740
(Zhou Jiahei)

275
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,140
(Zhou Daming, deceased)

276
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,460
(The boss, Hu Xiaomin, fresh market manager)

277
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,060
Is anyone here?

278
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,300
Help me!

279
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,620
Open the door!

280
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,660
Is anyone here?

281
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,620
Help!

282
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,260
Help!

283
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,580
I'm sorry.

284
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,260
It didn't work.

285
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,020
(Police)

286
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,260
I'll have Xiaoxing send her away tomorrow.

287
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,100
Where will she be sent?

288
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,700
Maybe you shouldn't ask.

289
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,020
Where exactly?

290
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:24,700
Does it matter, Lin?

291
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,020
If she's not sent away, what can you do?

292
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,220
I can help her go to school.

293
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:32,420
She can learn a skill to support herself.

294
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,490
Is it worth it?

295
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:35,900
She's been living at my place.

296
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,300
Her habits have improved.

297
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,980
She read books on her own.

298
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:39,940
She made me breakfast.

299
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,220
She even took care of the cat.

300
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,140
She needs someone to guide her.

301
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,420
You can also have dumplings

302
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,980
that she made for you, right?

303
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,300
How did you know?

304
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,460
Zhang Yanni.

305
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,900
The captain of the joint defense team

306
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,460
is obligated to report every detail.

307
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,700
Have you ever thought

308
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:08,180
about why this girl just happened to make

309
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,860
carrot and beef dumplings you love?

310
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,380
Why were you able to see her just

311
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,660
when she was reading a book?

312
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,660
Why does she just happen

313
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,340
to love getting up early

314
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,740
and making breakfast?

315
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:24,860
Why is she so good to your cat?

316
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,530
Because she already knows

317
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,780
what kind of dumplings you love.

318
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,940
She knows you like young people who read.

319
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,380
She knows you have to eat breakfast.

320
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,110
She knows you'll make do with yourself,

321
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,460
but not when it comes to your cat.

322
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,820
Don't you realize

323
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,020
things rarely happen perfectly like that?

324
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,580
She's been watching you,

325
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,340
studying you,

326
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,100
and plotting against you.

327
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,340
Can you wake up?

328
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,780
She's just an 18-year-old girl.

329
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,530
Do you really think she's that clever?

330
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,900
Here, take a look.

331
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,080
Why do I feel like she already

332
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,180
understands men very well?

333
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,100
(Interrogation record)

334
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:24,170
(Police)

335
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,160
Let me tell you something

336
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,620
about this 18-year-old girl.

337
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:28,580
She dropped out in seventh grade

338
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,140
and started hanging out with troublemakers.

339
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,480
She was suspected of robbery

340
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,520
and has been to the police station twice.

341
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,460
It's all recorded in the system.

342
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,620
(Interrogation record)

343
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,420
Later, she got involved with a rich man

344
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,820
and caused his family to fall apart.

345
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,570
Then she got beaten by his wife.

346
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,120
She couldn't stay there anymore.

347
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,320
She moved to the provincial capital

348
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,396
and started working at a barbershop.

349
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,020
She always tried to seduce the shop owner.

350
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,320
Eventually, she was kicked out.

351
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,100
Later on,

352
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,020
she joined the business

353
00:30:59,144 --> 00:31:00,244
with a woman named Yu Qian.

354
00:31:00,246 --> 00:31:01,646
(Including someone called Ding Zhenzhen)

355
00:31:01,646 --> 00:31:02,800
She's the type of person who's

356
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:04,120
lazy and just wants an easy life,

357
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,220
always dreaming of turning things around.

358
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,340
You

359
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,260
are her next target.

360
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,220
Do you get it?

361
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,420
You've done thorough research.

362
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,940
Exactly.

363
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:19,180
I've spent three days at her home and school.

364
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,120
I've talked to everyone

365
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:20,940
I could find.

366
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,180
If you've got time,

367
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,580
why not focus on the case?

368
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,700
This girl is the key to everything.

369
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,300
And you're also the key.

370
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,940
Your attitude towards her,
and hers towards you,

371
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,860
will determine if we find the crucial clues.

372
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,860
Let me ask you this.

373
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,540
Her dad passed away,

374
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,460
right?

375
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,460
Her mom abandoned her,

376
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,700
right?

377
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,820
She was abused at her uncle's house,

378
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,180
right?

379
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,460
What do you expect her to do?

380
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,820
She has done her best

381
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,180
to survive until now.

382
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,620
Lin, you can't let your own...

383
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,520
One's greatest weakness is another person.

384
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,860
That's what you said.

385
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,700
Did Zhang Yanni tell you that again?

386
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,580
But what about yourself?

387
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,740
Let me guess.

388
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,500
You had an unhappy childhood.

389
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,500
Ding Dang managed to escape.

390
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,820
She's trying to get her life back on track.

391
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,020
But what about you?

392
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,540
Have you ever truly tried?

393
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,420
Can you face your tragic past head-on?

394
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,400
Just look at yourself,

395
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,710
always with that stern expression,

396
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,380
keeping everyone at arm's length.

397
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,580
You're like someone trapped in a prison,

398
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,420
lacking even half this girl's courage.

399
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,340
Lin Guoqiang!

400
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:46,800
Do you know

401
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,940
why I'm investigating this?

402
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,860
Because that night...

403
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,380
Go back with them first.

404
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,940
The opportunity is here.

405
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,770
The opportunity is here.

406
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,220
What opportunity?

407
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,020
If I didn't know lip reading,

408
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,860
I would've been tricked by those two girls.

409
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,140
Is there anything you didn't tell us?

410
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,260
Nothing else.

411
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,460
Let me ask you this.

412
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,380
That day,

413
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,070
did you say "the opportunity is here"?

414
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,460
Did you say it or not?

415
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,420
Then explain what "opportunity" means.

416
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,260
What kind of "opportunity"?

417
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,120
Especially in that kind of situation,

418
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,620
why would you tell her that?

419
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,060
I want her to be better.

420
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,500
Just be honest with me.

421
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,700
Did you ever

422
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,380
suggest or guide Ding Dang

423
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,100
to investigate Lin Guoqiang?

424
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,700
No.

425
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:15,980
Are you serious?

426
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,830
You've always been staying with Ding Dang.

427
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,540
She would only be honest with you.

428
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,780
She would only follow you.

429
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,420
Do you think a young girl like her

430
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,700
could act

431
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,220
independently?

432
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,740
I feel she lacks social experience.

433
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,270
Someone must be manipulating her.

434
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,620
I'm giving you the chance to speak honestly.

435
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,140
What kind of opportunity is it

436
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:50,700
that makes you want her

437
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,820
to hold on tightly

438
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:53,060
in that situation?

439
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,060
They're all plotting against you, Lin.

440
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,770
They're just that kind of people.

441
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,620
They can cry whenever they want

442
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,820
and are good at playing the victim.

443
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,820
I've been a cop for 20 years.

444
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,460
People's hearts is the scariest thing

445
00:35:14,484 --> 00:35:14,916
I've seen.

446
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,220
You're getting older.

447
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,140
Do you realize your heart's softening?

448
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,440
She's already been through so much.

449
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,100
Isn't she unqualified to say that?

450
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,180
Her life

451
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,460
just needs one opportunity.

452
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,530
Others won't give her it,

453
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,700
but I will.

454
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,820
What do I have left to lose?

455
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,540
Every little bit

456
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,460
helps.

457
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:04,980
Xu,

458
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,500
don't assume everyone's bad.

459
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,780
I'm saving Ding Dang,

460
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,860
not because of who she is,

461
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,820
but because of who I am.

462
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,380
What you just told me,

463
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,340
she told me in person yesterday.

464
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:22,980
She also told me,

465
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,500
she secretly read my daughter's diary.

466
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,540
So now she knows

467
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,220
what kind of dumpling filling I like.

468
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,180
Mr. Lin.

469
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,260
I'm sorry.

470
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:31,460
I've said what needs to be said.

471
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:33,860
Take care of yourself.

472
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,820
Captain Xu.

473
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,100
Captain Xu.

474
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,180
Thank you.
