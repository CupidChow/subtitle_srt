1
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:25,070
Here is fine.

2
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,680
I'm heading home now.

3
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,400
See you tomorrow.

4
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,550
See you tomorrow.

5
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,880
Bye.

6
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,950
What's up?

7
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:48,840
We just parted,

8
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,000
and I already miss you.

9
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,840
I miss you too.

10
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,650
See you at work tomorrow.

11
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:01,920
I'm almost home now.

12
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,150
Hanging up.

13
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,960
See you tomorrow.

14
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:45,180
(Director Hou)

15
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:49,840
Honey,

16
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,960
why aren't you home yet?

17
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,310
I've warmed up the soup.

18
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:51,460
=Hanging Mirrors=

19
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,460
=Episode 1=

20
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:14,870
Keep driving.

21
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:15,720
You can't park here.

22
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,370
I'm here for Captain Gao.

23
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,790
Hey, Gao.

24
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,870
Xu?

25
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,350
What are you doing here, classmate?

26
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,150
I was just passing by and saw you.

27
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,630
I made dinner...

28
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,480
What's going on here?

29
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,350
- A traffic accident.
- Waiting for my wife.

30
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,360
I made a phone call,

31
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,480
and this guy answered.

32
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,950
My home is just nearby.

33
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,040
Only 200 meters away.

34
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,480
She was just 200 meters from home.

35
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,480
But she'll never make it back.

36
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,840
Two hundred meters.

37
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,360
Just 200 meters.

38
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:51,910
Director Hou,

39
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,920
will you go home

40
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,760
and change

41
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,040
or will you come with us now?

42
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,270
I'll go with you.

43
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,460
(Ambulance)

44
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,320
Director Hou?

45
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,640
Director of where?

46
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,480
A renowned one at the Oncology Hospital.

47
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:06,710
His wife passed away.

48
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,320
That's so tragic.

49
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,190
Such a wide intersection.

50
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:15,830
How could someone get hit?

51
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,270
No dash-cam footage.

52
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,400
I had them check the surveillance.

53
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,800
Take the person back.

54
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:23,790
Call for a tow truck.

55
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,790
Alright.

56
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,730
Got your license?

57
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,960
Is that him?

58
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,360
When he was younger, maybe.

59
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,270
Where did his hair go?

60
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,480
He must've been seriously ill.

61
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:48,790
I didn't bring it.

62
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,270
Tell me,

63
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,160
do you think anyone

64
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,430
would leave a family photo

65
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,830
carelessly in their car?

66
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,400
Him.

67
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,230
I have to ask him.

68
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,590
Is this you?

69
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,480
No.

70
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,320
It's mine.

71
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,710
It's evidence now.

72
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,140
How much did you drink?

73
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,950
I'm not sure.

74
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,070
Seems quite a bit.

75
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,200
Where did you drink?

76
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,560
At a friend's place.

77
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,080
Friend?

78
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,600
What's your friend's name?

79
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:27,480
Zhang Danian.

80
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,720
How many people were drinking?

81
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,910
Four people.

82
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,740
Where does your friend live?

83
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,760
In Taoyuan Community.

84
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,560
Do you remember what dishes you ate?

85
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,510
I drank too much. Can't recall.

86
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,830
How many dishes were there?

87
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,870
I really don't remember.

88
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,310
I drank too much.

89
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,240
So,

90
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,640
where were you headed?

91
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,080
Driving so fast.

92
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,080
Going home.

93
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:54,870
Where do you live?

94
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:55,710
East Suburbs.

95
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,390
East Suburbs?

96
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,070
This seems like the wrong direction.

97
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,470
Take him back.

98
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,440
Move.

99
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:11,760
He's hiding something.

100
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,630
Three?

101
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,980
You tell me,

102
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,160
no matter how much in love,

103
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:23,960
is it necessary

104
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,360
to carry it around?

105
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,390
It wasn't for her husband.

106
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,600
She was just 200 meters from home.

107
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,840
But she'll never make it back.

108
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,870
Did you just see Director Hou?

109
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,470
Was he crying or acting?

110
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,390
I didn't see any tears.

111
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,840
From that far away, I couldn't see clearly.

112
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,310
Do you suspect something?

113
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,200
No, we don't suspect.

114
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:57,740
We only deal with evidence.

115
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,870
I don't think this looks like a case

116
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,840
of a simple

117
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,960
drunk driving accident.

118
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,970
Hand it to the criminal police team.

119
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:04,870
Alright.

120
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,320
Hello?

121
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,600
Alright, you go to the scene first.

122
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,800
I'll head over right away.

123
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,320
Okay.

124
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,800
I'll go ahead now.

125
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,040
Hurry up.

126
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,870
Did any strangers linger here during the day?

127
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,590
Captain Xu.

128
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,720
A girl victim.

129
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,960
Her body was dismembered

130
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,310
and dumped in the sewer.

131
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,000
Are Coroner Guo and Technician Zheng here?

132
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,270
They're here. Down below.

133
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,980
(Medium Liquid Waste)

134
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,040
It rained heavily.

135
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,030
Workers found body parts

136
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,250
while inspecting the sewer
for potential clogs.

137
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,080
Captain Xu.

138
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,320
Be thorough.

139
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,420
- Okay.
- Got it.

140
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,440
Where's Guo?

141
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,230
Over there.

142
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,440
Alright.

143
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,740
- Captain Xu.
- Hey, Zheng.

144
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:58,990
Hey, Guo.

145
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,060
A woman's right forearm.

146
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,680
Based on the level of decomposition,

147
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,010
it's been here at least 10 days.

148
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,200
The nails are gone.

149
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,960
Were they naturally shed or pulled off?

150
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,040
They were pulled.

151
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,760
The fingerprints were stripped too.

152
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,710
It was someone skilled.

153
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,000
There's something even trickier.

154
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,320
It's also a right hand.

155
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,390
Two victims?

156
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,990
Dafei.

157
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,670
What did you find out?

158
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,750
The dredging worker said

159
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,750
he saw hands and feet floating in the water,

160
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,000
and a head

161
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,440
with long hair.

162
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,140
No wonder he was so scared.

163
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,200
Any other body parts?

164
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,680
Guo.

165
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:53,380
That's all. I've checked.

166
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,150
If no other body parts are found,

167
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,760
it means they were dumped elsewhere.

168
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,420
What do you think, Captain Xu?

169
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,390
The key is, those cuts are too clean.

170
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,560
Look.

171
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,090
The fractures on the bones

172
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,860
show no signs of hacking or chopping.

173
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,490
Looks like a saw was used.

174
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,670
And the body was likely frozen first.

175
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,750
Very professional.

176
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,560
Dafei,

177
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,040
is it reported?

178
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,920
Yes.

179
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,960
Director Yang
and Commissioner Cao are waiting.

180
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,470
Guo.

181
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,630
How soon can you get the report?

182
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,630
I'll prioritize it.

183
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,080
We found two victims in total.

184
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,670
Only their right hands and feet,

185
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,740
and the heads were found.

186
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,600
Left hands, feet, and torsos are missing.

187
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,600
We're still searching.

188
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,000
Both victims were female,

189
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,440
around 20 years old.

190
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,270
Cells show freezing and thawing signs.

191
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,390
This suggests the bodies were frozen.

192
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,670
The wounds

193
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,800
are very neat,

194
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,070
likely caused by a chainsaw.

195
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,200
Due to the freezing,

196
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,080
the exact time of death is hard to pinpoint.

197
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,560
We can only estimate

198
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,140
(Shuoyang Public Security Bureau)
it's within two months.

199
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,000
The two victims

200
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,600
died about 15 days apart.

201
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,320
(Road condition at the scene)
There's a blunt force injury

202
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,720
on the back of their heads,

203
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,360
and two strange marks

204
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,550
on their eyelids.

205
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,940
(Shuoyang Public Security)

206
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,800
Everyone,

207
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,790
today,

208
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,080
we're holding a brief meeting.

209
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,550
The Provincial Department

210
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,380
attaches great importance to this case,

211
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,790
so Commissioner Cao's personally
overseeing it.

212
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,260
Commissioner Cao's a familiar face to us all.

213
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,360
Everyone knows him well.

214
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,510
Xu Xiao, please brief everyone.

215
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,590
Alright.

216
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,150
The bodies were found

217
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,390
(Road condition at the scene)
in the sewer of Fenglin Road,

218
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,150
Binxi New District.

219
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,870
There are many

220
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,240
undeveloped real estate around,

221
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,350
and there's almost

222
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,510
no one there at night

223
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,620
as the place's very remote.

224
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:56,100
Also, the nearby roads are not yet open,

225
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,240
and the surveillance cameras

226
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,270
are not in use.

227
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,630
We're expanding the search.

228
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,270
(Sewer conditions)
The body parts at the scene

229
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,510
were discovered by several dredging workers.

230
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,060
No eyewitnesses were found.

231
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:07,900
(Specific details)

232
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,920
We're still looking.

233
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,030
If this is the work

234
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,080
of a serial killer,

235
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,120
they typically prefer

236
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,030
operating in familiar surroundings.

237
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,600
So the urgent task right now

238
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,360
is to quickly

239
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,200
identify the victims.

240
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,080
Yes, sir.

241
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,240
We're gathering

242
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,720
recent missing persons cases

243
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,150
and double-checking them

244
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,170
for new leads.

245
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,750
Do you have any difficulties right now?

246
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,080
Well, at the moment,

247
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,030
if the case team is established,

248
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,670
our office will be too small

249
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,510
to organize things.

250
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,040
The bureau's

251
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,960
Party committee has solved that for you.

252
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,460
Has Room 413 been vacated?

253
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,390
Yes, it's cleared out.

254
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,480
Lend it to them for a while.

255
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,790
We'll get it ready.

256
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,280
But just to clarify,

257
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,360
this office

258
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,750
is only temporarily lent to you.

259
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,160
Return it when you're done.

260
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,720
Of course, we'll return it.

261
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,340
Should we get more people on the team?

262
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,960
We don't want to waste such a big office.

263
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,030
Sure.

264
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,120
Do you want

265
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,790
Shang Jie and Li Xuekai to help?

266
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,480
If necessary,

267
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,030
you can assign any of us anytime.

268
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,120
Forget I said anything.

269
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,000
Well,

270
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
thanks for the office.

271
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,510
Today,

272
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,510
after this meeting,

273
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,750
- the case team will be established.
- Yes, sir.

274
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,270
You'll be the team leader

275
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,300
in charge.

276
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,160
Yes, sir.

277
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,720
The killer dumped the body in the sewer

278
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,270
to hide and destroy evidence faster.

279
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,150
That place is extremely remote.

280
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,360
It's impossible

281
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,630
for young women to live nearby.

282
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,320
This indicates

283
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,120
the crime scene and dump site are far apart.

284
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,390
According to crime statistics,

285
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,240
distance makes solving harder.

286
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,870
We might be facing a tough case.

287
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:42,630
Shang Jie,

288
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,270
brief Commissioner Cao

289
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,000
about the Li Helei case.

290
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,720
We've done some checks,

291
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,120
and Xia Ying has

292
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,600
done a DNA comparison.

293
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,390
It confirmed the missing woman's DNA

294
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,240
matches the one found

295
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,240
on the window screen

296
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,720
at Li Helei's house.

297
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,320
Commissioner Cao,

298
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,510
please report back

299
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,540
to Secretary Qian on this.

300
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,630
Everyone's doing their best.

301
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,960
So, tell the leader not to worry, okay?

302
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,800
Alright.

303
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,380
(Shuoyang Public Security Bureau)

304
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,680
We need to locate

305
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,000
the rest of the bodies quickly.

306
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,620
A regular refrigerator won't fit them.

307
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,200
It's highly likely a freezer was used.

308
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,480
Check connected sewage channels,

309
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,920
drainage ditches,

310
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:17,790
and small ponds.

311
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,630
No place unchecked.

312
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,930
Gather more men and expand the search area.

313
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,760
Xiaoxing, go to the archives

314
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:24,910
to check the missing persons

315
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:25,960
from the past three months

316
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,240
who haven't been archived yet.

317
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,320
Got it.

318
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,200
Let's meet in the new office
tomorrow morning.

319
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,720
- Morning, Captain Xu.
- My apologies.

320
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,120
I overslept.

321
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,160
Captain Xu.

322
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,390
Captain Xu.

323
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,000
Guo's sleeping pill work wonders.

324
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,320
He gave me one tablet

325
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:53,320
and told me to take half,

326
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,870
but I took the whole thing.

327
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,080
I just couldn't wake up.

328
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,440
You guys are fast, huh?

329
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,340
Got your spot already.

330
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,560
Yeah, we have.

331
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:02,840
It's spacious.

332
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:06,750
Where's mine?

333
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,310
You're the captain.

334
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,240
You oversee everything.

335
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,480
Upstairs.

336
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,310
Got an office upstairs?

337
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:13,960
Alright.

338
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,070
Guess I'll take it.

339
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,310
Gao, what's up?

340
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,960
You moved offices and didn't even tell me.

341
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,800
Made me waste a trip.

342
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,000
That's right.

343
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,490
We moved to a new office.

344
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,560
What's up?

345
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,200
The driver confessed everything.

346
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,840
Matches your assessment exactly.

347
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,960
I have late-stage colon cancer.

348
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,480
The doctor said

349
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,720
I have at most two months left.

350
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,400
I have a wife and child,

351
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,480
so I thought before I die,

352
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,480
I should leave something for them.

353
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,240
Do you know who you hit and killed?

354
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,400
I do.

355
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,960
She was the wife of my attending doctor,

356
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,750
Director Hou.

357
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,960
She was having an affair

358
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,110
with the vice president

359
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:00,950
of their company.

360
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,720
She betrayed Director Hou

361
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,270
but refused to divorce

362
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,300
because of the property.

363
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,160
Director Hou is

364
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,480
actually a good doctor.

365
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,680
He's been trying hard to treat me.

366
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,960
But how much did Director Hou spend

367
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,170
to hire someone to kill?

368
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,350
Half a million.

369
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,800
Can you imagine that?

370
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,620
A life partner worth just half a million.

371
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,240
He hung up on me.

372
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,140
(Police)

373
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,240
Half a million.

374
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,030
That's how much a life is worth.

375
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,350
Everyone,

376
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,240
stick to yesterday's grouping.

377
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,310
Get to work.

378
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,150
Got it.

379
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,000
Hi, Mr. Lin.

380
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,840
Xiaoxing.

381
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,160
What brings you here?

382
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,550
I need your help again.

383
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,360
Can you check the missing persons' records

384
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,590
for women aged 20 to 30

385
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,000
from the last three months?

386
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,800
Same drill.

387
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:26,950
Alright.

388
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,800
Here you go.

389
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,030
Has something happened?

390
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,070
A serious case.

391
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,350
The leaders and Director Yang
are overseeing it.

392
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,590
Captain Xu is leading the team.

393
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,310
Mr. Lin, can I use your computer?

394
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,200
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.

395
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:56,420
(Case Report)

396
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,440
Captain Lin.

397
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,350
The coroner's checked.

398
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:14,560
Only the right hand and foot,

399
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,840
and the head.

400
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,200
Found other torso parts?

401
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,040
Not yet.

402
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,920
Any info on the missing person?

403
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,000
Nothing.

404
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,250
Get someone to check it quickly.

405
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:37,950
Alright.

406
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,500
Conduct a thorough search.

407
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,510
Check if anyone nearby witnessed anything.

408
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,760
Yes, sir.

409
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:57,630
So far, you've only

410
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,840
found half of the body parts, right?

411
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,000
Yes.

412
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,510
Where was the incident site?

413
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,000
The sewer.

414
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,180
You only found the right parts,

415
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,040
right?

416
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,390
Yes.

417
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,760
Where is Xu Xiao?

418
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,040
In the office.

419
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,240
(Sewer entrance)
Mr. Lin.

420
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,420
(A.I. tattoo)

421
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,110
Captain Xu.

422
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,200
- Captain Xu?
- Mr. Lin.

423
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,200
What brings you here?

424
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,350
I'm here to see Captain Xu.

425
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,720
- Who's looking for me?
- Captain Xu, Mr. Lin is...

426
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,400
You asked me to...

427
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,240
Hold on.

428
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,590
Hello.

429
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,280
Captain Xu.

430
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,530
My name is Lin Guoqiang.

431
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,870
I'm the archive administrator.

432
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,720
I know you.

433
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,830
You used to be on the team

434
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,310
and earned a second-class merit

435
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,550
and two third-class merits.

436
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,510
You were in charge

437
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,400
of the 4/17 Case.

438
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,640
That's all in the past now.

439
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,160
What can I do for you?

440
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,720
You're handling this case now, right?

441
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,390
What's going on, Xiaoxing?

442
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:00,570
I went to the archives and...

443
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,390
Don't blame her.

444
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,080
That's on me.

445
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,710
This symbol appeared in a case I handled

446
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,780
many years ago.

447
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,450
You're a senior in this field.

448
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,080
You've seen more than we have.

449
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,800
What are you trying to tell us?

450
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,310
Captain Xu, come over here.

451
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,760
Come here.

452
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,440
The head,

453
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,400
right hand and foot

454
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,320
are considered Yang in nature.

455
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,310
You won't find the other half in the sewer.

456
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,590
Also,

457
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,000
the scratches on the eyelids

458
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,920
were made before death.

459
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,560
Mr. Lin,

460
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,790
we're working

461
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,160
on a heinous case here.

462
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,750
It's not about Yin-Yang
and Five Elements stuff

463
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,240
you're talking about.

464
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,000
Captain Xu, you're missing my point.

465
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,750
Maybe we're approaching this differently.

466
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,390
I just wanted to offer some advice.

467
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,030
Well, thank you for the advice.

468
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,240
But as you said earlier,

469
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,750
our approaches

470
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,710
are clearly different.

471
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,560
Also,

472
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,180
you're a senior officer,

473
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,160
so you're more familiar

474
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,190
with the rules than I am.

475
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,240
Good day.

476
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,550
Xiaoxing, if you do it again,

477
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,550
leave the team yourself.

478
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,150
Mr. Lin,

479
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,570
please don't make it hard for me.

480
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,520
Captain.

481
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,640
I just saw Lin from the archives at the door.

482
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,760
Why was he here?

483
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,440
He came to give us some advice.

484
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,590
Advice?

485
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,160
Wasn't he part of the team once?

486
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,200
Does he want to join the case team?

487
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:57,750
You know what?

488
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,200
Even though he's a senior,

489
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,750
he's still pretty capable.

490
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,720
We're short-staffed right now.

491
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,160
Why not bring him on board?

492
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,280
Alright.

493
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,370
Then it's on you to recruit him.

494
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,310
I misspoke.

495
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,510
Forget I said anything.

496
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:15,670
Hold on.

497
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,000
Let's go check the site again.

498
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,760
Alright.

499
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:33,720
Be careful.

500
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,030
Inform everyone

501
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,750
to rotate

502
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:00,790
every 15 to 30 minutes

503
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,730
to get some fresh air.

504
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:02,870
Got it.

505
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:05,870
Captain Xu.

506
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,750
It's been two days.

507
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,750
We've searched almost everywhere.

508
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,960
Everyone's exhausted.

509
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,550
Should we maybe

510
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,480
change our approach?

511
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,890
Get help from the precinct.

512
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:19,870
Send everyone down.

513
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,280
We're short on people.

514
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,480
Did you hear me?

515
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,190
Alright.

516
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:39,380
(Add contacts From past three days I'm Qiang)

517
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,340
(Qiang)

518
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,590
The head,

519
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,510
right hand and foot

520
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:43,590
are considered Yang

521
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,550
in nature.

522
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,960
So they were dumped in the sewer,
a Yin space.

523
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,440
You won't find the other half in the sewer.

524
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,940
The left hand and foot are considered Yin.

525
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,350
They must be placed in a Yang space.

526
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,620
(Qiang)

527
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,440
You're back.

528
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,510
You bought so much alcohol.

529
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,180
I'm tired, thought I'd drink.

530
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,160
Drinking without food won't do.

531
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,200
It's bad for your health.

532
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,270
I made some braised beef today.

533
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:51,110
I'll make you a quick dish to go with it.

534
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,320
No need.

535
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,430
Why?

536
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,200
You think I'll fight you for the alcohol?

537
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,680
Alright, go take a shower now.

538
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,000
Change out of the dirty clothes.

539
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,160
Toss them into the washer.

540
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,000
Okay.

541
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,720
Easy on the drinks, alright?

542
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,720
Wait until I finish cooking to have more.

543
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:25,600
Captain Xu,

544
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,830
we've checked the surveillance.

545
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:27,670
Nothing found.

546
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,400
We also ran DNA tests

547
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,500
on possible missing persons.

548
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,680
(Location of body found on 8/13)
None match.

549
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,510
There are too many places using freezers.

550
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,900
We're still investigating.

551
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:35,960
But we're shorthanded.

552
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,830
So far, we've only checked a third of them.

553
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,840
At this point,

554
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,400
nothing suspicious has been found.

555
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,680
Keep checking.

556
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,520
Yes, sir.

557
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,320
Got something to say?

558
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,320
Yes.

559
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,560
Good or bad?

560
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,000
Not sure yet.

561
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,350
Speak.

562
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,800
Director Yang wants to see you.

563
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,940
(Shuoyang Public Security Bureau)

564
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,580
(Director's Office)

565
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,590
You're here.

566
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,430
Director Yang.

567
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,830
I've given you the people,

568
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,400
and the office.

569
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:31,950
Now what?

570
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,680
Well, I was thinking...

571
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,540
Could I get more staff

572
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,920
from the precinct's police station?

573
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:41,210
If I give you people from the precinct,

574
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,210
and from the police station,

575
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,680
what about other cases?

576
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:47,160
You're the team leader now.

577
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,510
You need

578
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,070
to brainstorm solutions.

579
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,040
Alright, I'll figure it out.

580
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:53,870
Got it.

582
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:02,670
Dafei.

583
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,990
Conduct a thorough search.

584
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,040
Do it again.

585
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,320
Mr. Lin,

586
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,240
our approaches are clearly different.

587
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,790
We're working

588
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:32,960
on a heinous case here.

589
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,510
It's not about Yin-Yang
and Five Elements stuff

590
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,030
you're talking about.

591
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,060
(West Station Passenger Center)

592
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,590
- A body.
- What's going on?

593
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,590
Hey, bro, what are the cops looking for?

594
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,240
Must be a murder.

595
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,080
Searching for a body.

596
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,000
Captain Xu.

597
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,350
The sluice gate is just ahead.

598
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:22,360
Let's start searching downstream from here

599
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:23,860
and move in sections.

600
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:25,080
- Got it.
- Understood.

601
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,510
Keep your eyes sharp.

602
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:27,630
Got it, Captain Xu.

603
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,190
Don't move, Dafei.

604
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,310
Five o'clock behind you,

605
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,550
there's someone in red.

606
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,070
Murderers have

607
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,180
about a 40% chance of revisiting the location

608
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,280
where the body was dumped.

609
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:56,670
