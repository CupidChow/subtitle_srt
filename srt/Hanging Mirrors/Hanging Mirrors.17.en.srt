3
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:40,900
Ms. Chen,

4
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,940
you're a PhD holder.

5
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,660
Can't you stay out

6
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,850
of these fights and conflicts?

7
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,320
You went to the police station

8
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,100
just to save a cat.

9
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,210
Do you think it's worth it?

10
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,180
Isn't a cat's life a life?

11
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,270
A cat's life is as valuable as a human's.

12
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,530
Alright, perhaps I am shallow.

13
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,120
Let me take you home first.

14
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,340
What I said isn't wrong, right?

15
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,660
A human life is precious.

16
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,810
A cat's life is precious too.

17
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,380
Thanks for today.

18
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,660
Um,

19
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,580
would you like a drink upstairs later?

20
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,020
Why are you snorting?

21
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,580
Can't you avoid physical fights?

22
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,620
Isn't there an Animal Protection Association?

23
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,610
I didn't have time to...

24
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,850
Luckily, I know someone there.

25
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:24,860
Otherwise, you'd have a record.

26
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,420
How will you

27
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:27,940
write your thesis?

28
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,170
That's why

29
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,460
I called you quickly.

30
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,700
You can't always rely on me.

31
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,140
Right, I understand.

32
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,020
I'm sorry.

33
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,220
Sorry to bother you

34
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,780
when you're busy.

35
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,660
I'm really sorry.

36
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,220
Come on.

37
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,100
Come in, please.

38
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,220
Should I change shoes?

39
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,660
No, no, just come in.

40
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,580
Sorry about that,

41
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,170
I left in a hurry.

42
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,060
My room's a bit messy.

43
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,580
Make yourself comfortable.

44
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,980
Sure, it's fine.

45
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,020
Let me get you a drink.

46
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,660
No worries.

47
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,540
It's okay. Anything is fine.

48
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,610
- Sit anywhere.
- Alright.

49
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,290
This thing

50
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,660
came from underground, didn't it?

51
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,580
It's a replica.

52
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,540
Thanks a lot.

53
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,970
Having a police friend is quite handy.

54
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:19,900
Why's that?

55
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:21,730
Well,

56
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,050
the police

57
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,740
always remind you

58
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,400
to stay out of trouble.

59
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,890
So, having more police friends

60
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,380
helps keep society stable.

61
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,310
Has Wang Bingde been found?

62
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,820
The APB has been issued.

63
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,940
But Wang Bingde, you know,

64
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,320
is a seasoned tomb robber.

65
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,090
His counter-surveillance skills

66
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,290
are sharper than most.

67
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,980
Have you checked the properties

68
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:48,880
under their names?

69
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,760
We did long ago.

70
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,660
Nothing unusual.

71
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,730
What do you mean?

72
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:54,930
If this sacrifice

73
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,290
is indeed used by the monarch,

74
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,380
it requires a very complicated ritual.

75
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,540
They'd need to prepare

76
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,420
the site,

77
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,490
the items,

78
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,370
and the offerings.

79
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,770
So they are likely

80
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,890
to have secretly built such a place

81
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,380
to serve as an altar.

82
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,290
If it were you, would you easily give up?

83
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,890
Are you saying Wang Bingde might return?

84
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,980
But that's just a possibility.

85
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,290
That's my guess.

86
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,410
Where would the altar be?

87
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,280
Where do you think

88
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,290
the altar

89
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,770
might be located?

90
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,490
You haven't found

91
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,140
the torsos so far, have you?

92
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,290
According to their ritual,

93
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,340
torsos are considered

94
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,730
extremely Yin.

95
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,220
I suspect

96
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,560
those torsos

97
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,140
are hidden

98
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,260
in this altar.

99
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,890
Then this altar

100
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,660
should be located

101
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,720
in a place of extreme Yang.

102
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,380
It's place of extreme Yang again.

103
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:59,860
Why is that?

104
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,610
Because...

105
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,250
What?

106
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,580
How is he now?

107
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,900
When did it happen?

108
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,540
Where is he?

109
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:20,650
Okay, I'm coming now.

110
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:22,610
What's wrong?

111
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,050
Lin was sent to the hospital.

112
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,020
I need to go see him.

113
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,340
- I'll go with you.
- No, no, no.

114
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,290
Stay home.

115
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,200
Wait for my news, okay?

116
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,110
I'll go first.

117
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,010
Drive carefully, alright?

118
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:32,890
Alright.

119
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,580
(Information)

120
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,180
Captain.

121
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:00,730
He's still being rescued.

122
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,730
The doctor said the injuries are severe

123
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:03,930
and it's uncertain

124
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,860
whether he will wake up.

125
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,140
Go find the doctor

126
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,440
and tell him that he must be saved.

127
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,580
He must be saved!

128
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:15,940
Who found him?

129
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,170
A passing driver did.

130
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,020
Can you repeat

131
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,260
what you just said to me?

132
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,370
I was heading home after my night shift

133
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,050
and saw this guy lying by the road.

134
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,020
I thought he was just drunk.

135
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,370
Sir.

136
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:46,610
How are you, sir?

137
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,370
Wang Xiang...

138
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:50,930
Wang Xiang...

139
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,890
- Sir.
- Wang Xiang...

140
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:53,770
What did you say?

141
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:54,860
A Buick.

142
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,650
- Are you sure he said Wang Xiang?
- Yes.

143
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:00,530
Then what happened?

144
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,530
He said,

145
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:02,410
a Buick car.

146
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,170
Could it be him?

147
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,570
Wang Bingde has indeed returned.

148
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,160
He's using Ding Dang as the fifth offering.

149
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:11,890
Zheng,

150
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,050
check all nearby cameras.

151
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,370
We must find that Buick car.

152
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,250
Got it.

153
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,730
Thanks, sir.

154
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,300
- We appreciate it.
- Alright.

155
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,860
(Information)

156
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,530
I'll go check on him.

157
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,530
Here.

158
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,490
Who is it?

159
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:28,770
Zheng.

160
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:30,690
How's it going?

161
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,610
Captain Xu,

162
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:32,890
no cameras at the attack point.

163
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:33,820
But there's some nearby.

164
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,890
I'll get them out for you.

165
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:35,770
Alright.

166
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:02,650
Stop.

167
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:06,530
Rewind a bit.

168
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,250
Captain Xu, look.

169
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:17,530
It must be him.

170
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,290
The Buick from the incident site.

171
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,370
Keep playing.

172
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,370
Where is he turning this way to go?

173
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,410
What's this road?

174
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:37,370
This is

175
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,250
Linshui Road.

176
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,650
He entered Taoyuan Community.

177
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,580
Captain Xu, you okay?

178
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,050
He went to that community?

179
00:14:58,650 --> 00:14:59,860
The garage?

180
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,050
Isn't that Chen Nan's place?

181
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,770
Zheng Jiong, check if that car

182
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:05,800
is still in the community.

183
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,130
The car stayed in the community

184
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,220
for about half an hour.

185
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,610
Let's head to Chen Nan's place.

186
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,220
Quick, quick, quick.

187
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:01,490
Chen Nan!

188
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,060
Chen Nan!

189
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,700
Chen Nan!

190
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,460
(The portrait of Immortal Liu)

191
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:25,820
Captain Xu,

192
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,180
Chen Nan's phone.

193
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,050
No signs of struggle inside.

194
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,420
- Hello? Zheng.
- Captain Xu,

195
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,110
the last place where this Buick disappeared

196
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,540
was at the Ziqiang intersection

197
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,410
in Binhe New District.

198
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,100
But no cameras on that road.

199
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,910
Isn't Binhe New District the place

200
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,840
where the body parts were found?

201
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:44,890
Yeah.

202
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,130
What do we do now?

203
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:48,740
How late are we?

204
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,020
About 40 minutes.

205
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,570
Tell everyone to meet there.

206
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,820
Got it.

207
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,370
Let's go.

208
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:02,890
Go.

209
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,940
I've got a knife in my pocket.

210
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:09,880
Captain,

211
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,060
it's a three-way intersection.

212
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:12,210
What now?

213
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,860
Is Lin awake?

214
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,740
Not yet, still in surgery.

215
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,900
They are very likely

216
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:35,900
to have secretly

217
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,370
built an altar long ago.

218
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,460
The suspects

219
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:39,680
disposed of the bodies

220
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:40,720
according to the principle

221
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,110
of Yin and Yang opposing each other.

222
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,810
Head and right limbs

223
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:47,930
is of Yang nature,

224
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,660
so it was left at the places of extreme Yin.

225
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,330
I suspect

226
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,260
those torsos

227
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,180
are hidden

228
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,610
in this altar.

229
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,380
Among the six or seven spots you circled,

230
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,850
three are near railways.

231
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,610
Is there any significance?

232
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,530
They're all places of extreme Yang.

233
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,090
Places of extreme Yang.

234
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,180
Everyone,

235
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,810
start searching from the location I sent.

236
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,050
Within a ten-kilometer radius,

237
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,480
train stations and bus terminals,

238
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,080
south-facing slopes and north riverbanks,

239
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,270
Chaoyang Songbailin Power Plant,

240
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,570
and all large factories nearby

241
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:30,630
are considered places of extreme Yang.

242
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,460
Check them one by one.

243
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,330
- Got it.
- Got it.

244
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,550
- Get in.
- Let's go.

245
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,770
You police officers...

246
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,330
I shouldn't date anyone.

247
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:30,370
What's the point of dating?

248
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,700
Anyone who loves you is unlucky.

249
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,330
You can't even care for yourselves,

250
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,370
let alone your family.

251
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,090
Who can you care for, really?

252
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:46,730
Why can't you just live quietly?

253
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:47,700
Can't you stay out of it?

254
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,850
Can't you let me relax?

255
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,740
Run!

256
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,180
(6.3 km, the auxiliary road of South Second Ring)
Xiaoxing, Xiaoxing.

257
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,220
- Captain Xu.
- Xiaoxing, 12 km

258
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:12,980
to your northwest,

259
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,250
there are some agritourism farms.

260
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,370
Take people to check it out.

261
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,500
Got it.

262
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,660
(Waiting)

263
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,180
(6 km, the auxiliary road
of South Second Ring)

264
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,490
Xu Xiaocong, 8 km to your east,

265
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:24,930
there's a long-distance bus station.

266
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,940
Wang Zhi,

267
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,810
8 or 9 km to your southeast,

268
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,360
there's a residential area under renovation.

269
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,610
Take a few more people with you.

270
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,300
Xiao Qiang,

271
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,980
7 km to your southwest,

272
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,730
there's a small forest park.

273
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:40,650
It has hills and water.

274
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,380
Captain Xu, the police station got a report.

275
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,260
6 km to the southwest,

276
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,520
there's a coal processing plant.

277
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,380
Who can go there?

278
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,460
We're too far from there.

279
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:47,650
Right here.

280
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,660
We'll head there. Join us quickly.

281
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,540
Got it.

282
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,530
I know this processing plant.

283
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,260
It's been abandoned for ages.

284
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:57,610
My dad said working here in the past

285
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:58,980
was like having a golden rice bowl.

286
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,530
It's been closed for quite a while.

287
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:02,610
Alright.

288
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,060
Let's check it out.

289
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,980
You'll need a witness, right?

290
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,030
Otherwise, others would think you are crazy.

291
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:36,900
You can tie me up.

292
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,220
It's easy to end me,

293
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,220
anywhere, anytime.

294
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,300
Turn around.

295
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:57,260
Aren't you here to witness my immortality?

296
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,370
I'll show you.

297
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:28,210
Get in.

298
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,700
Wang Bingde,

299
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,940
have you ever thought

300
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,420
that this "immortality technique"

301
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,300
might be fake?

302
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,610
There's no such thing as immortals.

303
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,900
No one can live forever.

304
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,190
What are you planning to do?

305
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,340
Wang Bingde!

306
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,050
Even if you take her life,

307
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,940
it won't grant you immortality.

308
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:08,250
Wang... Wang Bingde.

309
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:10,700
Wang Bingde!

310
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,090
You don't let go of Ding Dang

311
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,730
because of that unfinished mark.

312
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:37,980
Wang... Wang Bingde,

313
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,900
there's no immortality technique.

314
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,130
That was all a trick

315
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:47,380
played by wizards

316
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,570
like Liu Chuan.

317
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,220
Wang Bingde,

318
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:17,940
release us.

319
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:12,090
Dafei.

320
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:13,780
Dafei,

321
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,460
check if there's another way out.

322
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,220
Wang Bingde!

323
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:32,860
Xu Xiao.

324
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:06,490
Ding Dang.

325
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,420
Wang Bingde,

326
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,300
