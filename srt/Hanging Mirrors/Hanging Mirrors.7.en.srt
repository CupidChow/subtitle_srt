Daming

4
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,210
was too careless.

5
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,170
It hadn't even exploded,

6
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,890
how could he just go down there?

7
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,330
He

8
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,930
had a child.

9
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,170
Wasn't the kid taken by that woman?

10
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,170
Alright.

11
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,050
I'll go calm things down.

12
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,010
Thanks, bro.

13
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,560
Hey.

14
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,680
You need to step up

15
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,650
and take on Daming's

16
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,680
responsibilities.

17
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,050
It'll pay better

18
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,770
than installing toilets.

19
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:29,930
Got it?

20
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,680
Recently,

21
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:34,980
we found a flaming tomb.

22
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,880
You should head in.

23
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:37,610
Lose some weight.

24
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,240
Look at yourself.

25
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,210
You can't even fit.

26
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,400
You may get stuck.

27
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,800
Did you hear me?

28
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,120
Thanks, bro.

29
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,400
Daming…

30
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,450
Well,

31
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,800
after all these years,

32
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,170
isn't it foolish?

33
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,650
What a loser.

34
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,610
Bro,

35
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,920
let me top you off.

36
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,000
Drink.

37
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,400
You're my brother.

38
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,960
My brother.

39
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,810
I'll give you money.

40
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,250
A million.

41
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,170
Five million.

42
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:35,810
I'll give it all to you.

43
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,010
Let me go, man.

44
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,330
I've got something good.

45
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,690
Top-notch stuff.

46
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,600
I'll give it to you.

47
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,160
It's for immortality.

48
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,690
Immortality…

49
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,360
Where is it?

50
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,480
In the living room safe.

51
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,000
Bro,

52
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,920
why didn't you say so earlier?

53
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:03,770
Get up.

54
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:04,650
Show me.

55
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:30,850
The shell.

56
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,440
Let me go.

57
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,410
Bro,

58
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,040
pack all the money.

59
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,410
Okay.

60
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:52,610
Go to hell.

61
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,120
Bro,

62
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:15,490
rest up.

63
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,220
Sir,

64
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,500
harboring is also a felony.

65
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,780
If you tell the truth,

66
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,660
we'll show leniency.

67
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,260
Please come with us.

68
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:47,260
Where are they?

69
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,220
Where?

70
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,100
They are over there.

71
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,660
Hurry.

72
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,540
That way. That way.

73
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:54,900
Great-uncle.

74
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,140
Over there.

75
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,740
Great-uncle.

76
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,620
Great-uncle.

77
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,100
Great-uncle.

78
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,420
You're confused.

79
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,900
You can't go with them.

80
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,900
Don't go to that place.

81
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,140
Who are you?

82
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,380
Who am I?

83
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,420
It's not your concern.

84
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,700
My great-uncle's not going with you today.

85
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,060
He's a key witness.

86
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,300
He has to come with us.

87
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,660
Key witness or not.

88
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,300
He's not going with you.

89
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,460
He's not leaving.

90
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,580
He can't go with you.

91
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,450
Great-uncle,

92
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,540
what did you say?

93
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,260
What did I say?

94
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,900
He's dead.

95
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,500
I said it all.

96
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,910
It makes it clearer they can't go.

97
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,140
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

98
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,740
- You can't go.
- You can't.

99
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,820
I'm warning you.

100
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,380
Don't try anything reckless.

101
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,580
Trying to attack a cop?

102
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,700
I've been a cop for 40 years.

103
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,020
This is the first time

104
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,260
someone's trying to act

105
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,940
with a rusty shovel.

106
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,220
Dying under this shovel

107
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,700
would be your honor.

108
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,190
Go!

109
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,260
Listen up.

110
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,380
If we're not back

111
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,660
at the station in two hours,

112
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,660
the entire Public Security Bureau

113
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,880
will come looking for us.

114
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,420
I'll bury you in the tomb

115
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,540
and sink the car in the river,

116
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,620
the police

117
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,060
won't find anything.

118
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,900
This is knowingly breaking the law.

119
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,540
(Xu Xiao)

120
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,740
(Chen Nan)

121
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,980
(Xu Xiao)
I think

122
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,140
we should just tie them up.

123
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:49,860
Would that work?

124
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,260
- Why not?
- Think it through.

125
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,780
If I'm gonna die, I want answers.

126
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,380
Is Zhou Jiahei your boss,

127
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,380
or is it Zhou Daye?

128
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,620
What are you talking about?

129
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,500
I don't know anything.

130
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,180
My great-uncle's
not going with you today.

131
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,740
Get them!

132
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,700
Consort Bai's Tomb.

133
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:06,960
Consort Bai's Tomb?

134
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,700
How does she know about it?

135
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,780
- Yeah.
- We've been looking for it for ages.

136
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,020
Why does she know?

137
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:12,900
Are you...

138
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:18,020
Are you guys looking
for Consort Bai's Tomb?

139
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,020
How do you know?

140
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:24,020
It has plenty of treasures, right?

141
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,060
But the Yuan tombs

142
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,700
are different from the others.

143
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,420
If you find the right spot

144
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,820
but wrong layer,

145
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,900
it still won't work.

146
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,420
But there's really good stuff in there.

147
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,420
Pick any item,

148
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,420
and your village could live off it.

149
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,740
Can she find it?

150
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,380
- We tried so hard but failed.
- Yeah.

151
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,500
We couldn't find it.

152
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,540
No.

153
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,820
Just because you couldn't

154
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,500
doesn't mean I can't.

155
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,780
I have a PhD in archaeology.

156
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,220
With geomancy,

157
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,580
advanced technology,

158
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,260
and satellite imaging,

159
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,220
everything underground

160
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,540
is crystal clear to us.

161
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,510
Look at the mountains.

162
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,820
It's great Feng Shui, right?

163
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,260
The mountains and rivers

164
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,500
resemble dragon veins.

165
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,520
The Feng Shui is amazing.

166
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,900
How many noble tombs are here?

167
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,620
Noble tombs?

168
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,860
There must be treasures.

169
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,740
How about this?

170
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,180
Have her take us to dig.

171
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,340
We can.

172
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,380
Let's make a deal.

173
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,300
Let us go.

174
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,860
I'll tell you where it is.

175
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,420
There are treasures buried here.

176
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,860
We have to dig them up.

177
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,740
Shut up.

178
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:26,980
If we let them go,

179
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,140
we're all doomed.

180
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,260
Harming officers is a serious crime.

181
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,660
All our cars have GPS.

182
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,540
GPS and surveillance.

183
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,060
They know exactly where we are.

184
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,540
None of you can escape.

185
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,900
Think about it.

186
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,260
Money

187
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,460
or your life.

188
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,620
What's more important?

189
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,140
No way. If we let you go,

190
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,260
what if you come back for us?

191
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,780
Exactly. What if you arrest us?

192
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,660
- No way.
- Yeah.

193
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,780
- Right.
- You can't.

194
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,260
Police need evidence to make arrests.

195
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,650
They can't arrest you randomly.

196
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,100
If you come with tips,

197
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,140
and they definitely won't.

198
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,540
- No matter what,
- Wait.

199
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,700
you can't leave today.

200
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,500
- You can't leave.
- Dajiang!

201
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,660
You…

202
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,380
You are…

203
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,780
- Don't…
- Chief.

204
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,660
Chief!

205
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,860
- Great-uncle.
- Great-uncle.

206
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,740
- Chief.
- Sir.

207
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,710
- You okay?
- Call an ambulance.

208
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,780
Chief.

209
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,860
Great-uncle.

210
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,780
(Missed Call from Chen Nan)

211
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,740
Look.

212
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,180
Consort Bai's Tomb is right here.

213
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,020
Here.

214
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,020
It's right there.

215
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,640
I gave you the location.

216
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,620
Can we leave now?

217
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,740
Officer,

218
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,420
we're not grave robbers.

219
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,620
If we

220
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,550
find something

221
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,620
while digging a foundation,

222
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,660
we'll report it right away.

223
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,660
Keep a close eye

224
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,620
- on the one who attacked me.
- Got it.

225
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,620
Let's go check on Chief.

226
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,420
- Let's go.
- Alright.

227
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,500
Let me see.

228
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,380
Mine.

229
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,870
Consort Bai's Tomb really exists?

230
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,500
I was tricking them.

231
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,380
I'm glad you came.

232
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,740
Thank you.

233
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,260
You saved my life.

234
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,660
No need for that, Mr. Lin.

235
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,620
Xu Xiao.

236
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,500
Hello?

237
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,900
Why aren't you answering?

238
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,900
What happened?

239
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,020
Nothing serious.

240
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,380
Someone just

241
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,260
tried to kill us to silence us.

242
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,900
Is it resolved now?

243
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,820
Keep your voice down.

244
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,420
Mr. Lin and I sorted it out.

245
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,580
Is Lin okay?

246
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,660
He can explain it to you himself.

247
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,540
Let's meet at Zhou Daye's place.

248
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,500
Alright, got it.

249
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,220
Thanks.

250
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:01,780
(Foot Spa)

251
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:33,980
Lin.

252
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,020
What's going on?

253
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,810
Are you okay?

254
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:36,780
It's all taken care of.

255
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,940
One thing's confirmed.

256
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,540
Zhou Jiahei had a secret son

257
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,620
named Zhou Daye.

258
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,300
And he adopted Zhou Daming.

259
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,660
Cao Cao's portrait.

260
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,100
Cao Cao's portrait.

261
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,140
What are you looking for?

262
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,140
Cao Cao's portrait.

263
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,780
Over here.

264
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,780
Take a look. Is this it?

265
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,780
The one behind it all is Zhou Jiahei.

266
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,030
Leader of tomb raiders in Zhouli Village.

267
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,740
Moreover,

268
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,780
Zhou Jiahei

269
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,100
had a peculiar habit

270
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,380
during tomb raids.

271
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,100
Zhou Daye inherited his work

272
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,860
and his peculiar habit.

273
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,860
Even became the gang's handler.

274
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,220
But Zhou Daming became a digger.

275
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,740
Daye,

276
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,100
Daming, listen up.

277
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,460
I hid a few jade pieces down there.

278
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,140
Go find them in half

279
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,780
an incense stick's time.

280
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,300
Whoever finds it

281
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,060
gets rewarded.

282
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,140
If you're overdue—

283
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,420
punishment.

284
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,820
Go.

285
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,540
Found it.

286
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,780
Dad, I found it.

287
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,700
Within

288
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,540
the time limit. Well done.

289
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,820
Daming, look.

290
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,340
How long did you take?

291
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,780
It's almost burned out.

292
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,180
What did you find?

293
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,740
Go down and try again.

294
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,260
Found the second piece.

295
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,140
A jade Buddha.

296
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:23,940
Hurry up!

297
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,620
Hello?

298
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:33,940
Second floor.

299
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,450
- Senior.
- Hi.

300
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,540
Senior,

301
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,860
is this an incident site?

302
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:46,940
So thrilling.

303
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,340
Where's that dark wood coffin?

304
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,060
What are you doing?

305
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,300
You can't go inside.

306
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:53,780
Ms. Chen,

307
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,380
it's against our agreement.

308
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,260
We have rules.

309
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,460
They are not allowed inside.

310
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,260
Thank you for coming.

311
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,140
You can head back now.

312
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,420
What do you have?

313
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:11,940
Yu Qi.

314
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,380
Why did you bring his skull?

315
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,540
Just watch.

316
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,540
Fits perfectly, right?

317
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,980
It proves that 10 years ago,

318
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,780
Zhou Jiahei entered the ancient tomb

319
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,620
and took the ruler's tooth.

320
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,140
Check this out.

321
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,300
What's in this suitcase?

322
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,780
Tortoise shells.

323
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,460
There was

324
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,780
a tortoise shell stored here.

325
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,260
May I?

326
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,140
Sure.

327
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,100
Where did you get these tortoise shells?

328
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,620
There were many

329
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,700
in the Zhou Tomb.

330
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,220
Zhou Jiahei

331
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,220
must've gone to that ancient tomb

332
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,620
and taken the tortoise shell.

333
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,340
From the shell,

334
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,340
he obtained the so-called

335
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,340
immortality technique.

336
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,380
"Method of immortality,

337
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,620
recorded in the shell."

338
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,370
You can just casually carry

339
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,540
the relics around in public like this?

340
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,580
Are you out of your mind?

341
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,580
Of course we wouldn't.

342
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,140
These are replicas

343
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,340
for research purposes.

344
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,460
I've got this ready.

345
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,620
A van?

346
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,180
Get down.

347
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,140
Look over there.

348
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,300
Should we just leave?

349
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,660
Wait a sec.

350
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,540
Seems he's leaving.

351
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,620
Quiet.

352
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,060
Ten years ago,

353
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,700
through eyewitnesses,

354
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,540
we identified Zhou Jiahei

355
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:30,900
and found body parts.

356
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,740
But the arrest went wrong.

357
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,740
Zhou Jiahei took his own life,

358
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,700
leaving everything

359
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,780
to his illegitimate son,

360
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:56,860
Zhou Daye.

361
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,500
Including the tortoise shell

362
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,020
and the strange rituals up there,

363
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,540
Zhou Daye was

364
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,020
obsessed with the occult.

365
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,300
He slept in a coffin

366
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,820
and took supplements.

367
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,060
I suspect

368
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,780
he was trying to refine elixirs.

369
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,470
If I hadn't seen it myself,

370
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,740
I wouldn't believe people still

371
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,940
do that kind of thing nowadays.

372
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,740
Evil practices

373
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,940
are often passed down.

374
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,020
Does that tripod

375
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,100
look familiar?

376
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,100
What do you mean?

377
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,860
Hard to say.

378
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,620
I'll do some research when I get back.

379
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,980
How did the clan chief know this?

380
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,060
After Zhou Jiahei's death,

381
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,220
Zhou Daye

382
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,780
and the chief were very close.

383
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,380
So, it seems Zhou Jiahei

384
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,500
adopted Zhou Daming

385
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,620
with bad intentions.

386
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,500
He was probably planning

387
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,340
to use him

388
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,700
as a scapegoat for his son one day.

389
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,700
Very likely.

390
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,220
Zhou Daye

391
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,220
blew up Zhou Daming in the tomb,

392
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,050
making it hard for us to investigate.

393
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,900
But what he didn't expect was

394
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,380
that he'd also be killed,

395
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,630
with the tortoise shell taken.

396
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,260
Seems the tortoise shell

397
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,500
is nothing but trouble.

398
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,900
Captain Xu.

399
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,940
The victim is Hu Xiaomin,

400
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,100
also named Zhou Daye.

401
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,900
We traced his call logs, residency records,

402
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,300
and personal relationships.

403
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,700
His parents are dead.

404
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,580
No direct relatives.

405
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,980
Three types of people
had close contact with him.

406
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:35,940
First,

407
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,620
some subordinates with relic crime records.

408
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:38,740
Second,

409
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,190
people trading and collecting relics.

410
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,540
Lastly, two women

411
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,780
he usually contacted at night

412
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,020
I suspect

413
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,210
they were his mistresses.

414
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:47,980
Lin,

415
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,340
we need to interrogate everyone

416
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,500
she just mentioned.

417
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,620
(Chen Xiaoxing
Shuoyang Public Security Bureau)

418
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,740
Who is Wang Shiyi?

419
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,620
(Police Ran Xiongfei)
Are you Qi Li?

420
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,580
Is this man

421
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,300
your boyfriend?

422
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,580
Yeah.

423
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,060
Do you know this guy?

424
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,180
I do.

425
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,220
Why?

426
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:44,900
He died.

427
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,140
We need to have some questions answered.

428
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,940
How long

429
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,300
were you together?

430
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,140
Not quite half a year.

431
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,700
He said

432
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,700
he was studying traditional culture.

433
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,340
But later, I found him really creepy.

434
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:03,860
Why?

435
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,100
Because…

436
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,220
He slept in a coffin.

437
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,380
He explained to me

438
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,700
it was for skincare.

439
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,860
He said that coffin

440
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,860
was custom-made by a master.

441
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,540
I stopped seeing him after that.

442
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,100
All that immortality stuff

443
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,140
is pure nonsense.

444
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,580
Just superstition.

445
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,840
If bad people could live forever,

446
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,460
wouldn't the world be doomed?

447
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,580
There's a saying,

448
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,180
"The good die young,

449
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,540
while the wicked live long."

450
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,020
That's why people like us exist,

451
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,950
to make sure the wicked don't live long.

452
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,300
But seriously.

453
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,180
Why were Zhou Daye

454
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,300
and his father

455
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,580
so obsessed

456
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,500
and crazy about all of this?

457
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,780
Superstition. That's why.

458
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,820
How do you explain
the changes in Zhou Daye's body?

459
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,270
He must've been taking something.

460
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,180
Obviously.

461
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,300
The so-called elixirs

462
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,340
Zhou Daye was refining

463
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,660
have aphrodisiac ingredients.

464
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,060
Guo's tests confirmed it.

465
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,660
Don't forget.

466
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,990
In the Ancient Yu Kingdom tomb,

467
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,020
the ruler's dental age was

468
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,460
20 years younger than his actual age.

469
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,340
That's what you think.

470
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,060
Clearly, something's fishy here.

471
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,780
I'm discussing logic with you.

472
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,740
It's academic.

473
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,220
Whatever discussion

474
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,260
can't defy common sense, right?

475
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,220
What else is left to debate?

476
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,810
Where are you headed after this?

477
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:55,740
To your mom's place?

478
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,540
Yeah.

479
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,810
She's been home alone lately.

480
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,100
Haven't visited her in a while.

481
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,940
I'll go check on her.

482
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,420
Where's your dad?

483
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,340
No idea.

484
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:09,940
Drive safely.

485
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,180
Bye.

486
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,710
He used the name Hu Xiaomin.

487
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,880
His real name was

488
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:40,900
Zhou Daye.

489
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:41,900
Lin

490
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,740
once saw him

491
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,860
dumping a body.

492
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,940
Police. Don't move!

493
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,540
They had a direct confrontation.

494
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,100
During the fight,

495
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,700
his left ankle got injured.

496
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,500
He is suspected to be

497
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,580
(Zhou Daye, Suspect of 8/13 Case)
the main culprit of the serial murders.

498
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,500
After verification,

499
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,940
he was the successor to Zhou Jiahei,

500
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,780
the 10/13 Case's criminal a decade ago.

501
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,540
(Uncle Zhou Shouben)
This man named Zhou Shouben

502
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,000
was the clan chief of Zhouli Village.

503
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,980
He died of a sudden heart attack.

504
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,580
While alive, he helped

505
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,260
cover up the father-son relationship

506
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,860
of Zhou Jiahei and Zhou Daye.

507
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,820
As for Zhouli Village,

508
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,300
it's now become a hub

509
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,780
for tomb raiding activities,

510
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:16,900
developing into

511
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,160
a regional crime hotspot.

512
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,860
Hu Xiaomin?

513
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,100
A fake identity.

514
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,020
How deep could it be hidden?

515
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,460
Almost indistinguishable from reality.

516
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,700
Xiaoxing.

517
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,580
It's a ghost identity.

518
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,220
The real Hu Xiaomin was actually

519
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,260
from a remote area in another province.

520
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,740
That man died ten years ago.

521
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,060
Following protocol,

522
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,350
his family should've
deactivated his identity records

523
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,860
at local police station.

524
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,340
But they sold all his personal information

525
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,460
to traffickers for profit.

526
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:50,260
Traffickers then sold it on the dark web.

527
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,700
Because this identity

528
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,300
was originally real and legitimate,

529
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,540
it could be used to create a clean slate.

530
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,940
Let a person start a life as the deceased.

531
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,380
He used the name Chen Jialun

532
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,540
at the property management,

533
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,580
using

534
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,540
a fake ID.

535
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,100
In short, he was extremely cunning.

536
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,580
We're still checking
if he used other identities.

537
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,300
In daily life, he was very cautious.

538
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,980
His car didn't have a dashcam,

539
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,780
and he used a non-smart phone.

540
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,140
This one.

541
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:19,860
Dafei.

542
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,060
On the day of the crime,

543
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,100
the victim, Zhou Daye,

544
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,740
contacted eight people.

545
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,300
Three were his employees,

546
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,100
and four were his suppliers.

547
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,860
None had any criminal record.

548
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,860
But there was one man

549
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,780
who's a renovation worker.

550
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,420
(Zhou Wenhao, Zhou Daye Murder Suspect)
According

551
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,460
to Shen Chao, a suspect we arrested,

552
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,460
his name is Zhou Wenhao.

553
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,020
Zhou Daming's closest ally

554
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,140
and loyal follower.

555
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:47,040
The day Zhou Daming went into the tomb,

556
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,160
Zhou Wenhao was out of town.

557
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,260
After hearing

558
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,500
Zhou Daming was killed,

559
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,940
he rushed back and took revenge
on Zhou Daye.

560
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,580
He killed Zhou Daye by

561
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,780
suffocating him in a coffin

562
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,540
(Zhou Daye's Murder Scene)
with window caulk applied.

563
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,220
After the murder,

564
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,300
he disappeared.

565
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,700
We issued a warrant for him.

566
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,060
The person you just mentioned,

567
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,860
how did he know

568
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,820
Zhou Daming was

569
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,220
killed by Zhou Daye?

570
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,900
We're not sure.

571
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:14,650
Maybe some other sources of information.

572
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:15,860
I have a question.

573
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,020
Why was Zhou Daye,

574
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,620
aka Hu Xiaomin,

575
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,620
at the chicken farm?

576
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,620
Many criminals

577
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,700
revisit the crime scene.

578
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,460
First,

579
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,060
to gather Intel on the police.

580
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,420
Second,

581
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,660
to mislead us with false info.

582
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,720
Zhou Daming's wife abandoned him,

583
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,340
so he resented sex workers.

584
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:40,100
The false clues about Zhou Daming was a decoy

585
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,100
to mislead us.

586
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,740
With his intelligence,

587
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,670
he should've figured it out.

588
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,140
However,

589
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,020
it was too deliberate.

590
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,540
For all this time,

591
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,130
his true identity had never been exposed?

592
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,700
We visited the grocery he ran.

593
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,660
A small place

594
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,750
with only three employees.

595
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,540
None of them know his real identity.

596
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,060
Additionally,

597
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:58,940
that location

598
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,580
is not the original crime scene.

599
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,220
That's correct.

600
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,940
Zhou Daye killed Zhou Daming,

601
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,060
and Zhou Wenhao, Zhou Daming's bro

602
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,940
took revenge and killed Zhou Daye

603
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,190
before going on the run.

604
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,300
Logically speaking,

605
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,620
this case is

606
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,500
already a closed loop.

607
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,660
Since it's confirmed

608
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,080
Zhou Daye was the main perpetrator,

609
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,020
could his home

610
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,540
be the site of the murder

611
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,620
and dismemberment?

612
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,500
We've checked all his properties

613
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,820
and those listed under his relatives.

614
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:32,990
None were the crime scene.

615
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,540
Have you found

616
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,900
the victim's torsos?

617
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:41,860
Not yet.

618
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,100
We can't rule out destruction of evidence.

619
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,220
The priority now

620
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,380
is to capture Zhou Wenhao.

621
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,460
As long as we get him,

622
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,820
there'll be

623
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,140
major progress in the case.

624
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,260
I think

625
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,020
they must have accomplices.

626
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,340
Dafei said it's a closed loop.

627
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,380
But it feels

628
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:02,820
way too perfect.

629
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,580
So far,

630
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,460
not a single key figure

631
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,660
has fallen into our hands.

632
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,740
Think about it.

633
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:11,330
Those bags of heads,

634
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,180
and limbs

635
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,180
are very heavy.

636
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,540
How could one person

637
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,240
carry them into the sewer overnight?

638
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,420
It's impossible.

639
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,260
Ten years ago,

640
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:23,060
Zhou Jiahei dismembered
and dumped bodies.

641
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:24,950
And now, ten years later,

642
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,660
his son

643
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,320
committed crimes using the same methods.

644
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,220
And the way he did it

645
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,540
is closely tied to the mysterious rituals

646
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:35,420
of Ancient Yu Kingdom
that Chen Nan mentioned.

647
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,100
I think

648
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,500
someone out there is

649
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,940
pursuing forbidden occult for immortality.

650
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,150
If the root cause isn't addressed,

651
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,180
there will be another Zhou Jiahei,

652
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,580
or Zhou Daye.

653
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,460
Perhaps,

654
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,700
there already is.
