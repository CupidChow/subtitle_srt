3
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,260
Captain Xu,

4
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,140
she is...

5
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,340
Gao Jing,

6
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,980
the bag is here. Where's the person?

7
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,430
She's in the restroom.

8
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,180
(Restroom)

9
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,150
Captain Xu,

10
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,310
you're finally here.

11
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,150
Hold on a second.

12
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,780
Answer my questions honestly, okay?

13
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,460
Director Zhao is listening here.

14
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,380
Don't lie.

15
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,380
I'm not someone who lies!

16
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,100
What exactly are you doing here?

17
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,660
Take a look at this.

18
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,060
At that time,

19
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,040
the Ancient Yu Kingdom's

20
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:45,040
Longevity Ritual culture

21
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,000
had a significant impact
on surrounding areas.

22
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,340
In other ancient tombs,

23
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,620
we also found some records

24
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,100
about the Longevity Ritual,

25
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,560
saying there's a tripod

26
00:02:52,684 --> 00:02:53,876
in the Ancient Yu Kingdom.

27
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,660
This tripod played a critical role

28
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,280
in the whole process of the ritual.

29
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,060
But the records don't explain clearly

30
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,640
what exactly this tripod was used for.

31
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,070
It's also mentioned in the burial list.

32
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,460
It's called Longevity Tripod.

33
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,660
What's a burial list?

34
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,660
A burial list is

35
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,940
a catalog of items buried with the deceased.

36
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,780
And

37
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,060
I remember

38
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,430
that when we first started excavating,

39
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,940
we did find a round tripod buried there.

40
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,500
The craftsmanship was incredibly refined.

41
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,920
But it was much smaller

42
00:03:22,944 --> 00:03:24,056
than a ruler's tripod.

43
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,630
The local museum

44
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,150
wants to act as a front,

45
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,900
so it applied to borrow it

46
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,900
for an exhibition.

47
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,620
So, we send this tripod

48
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,340
along with some other artifacts

49
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,470
to the museum.

50
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,190
Look at this tripod.

51
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,060
On this tripod,

52
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,040
there are inscriptions.

53
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,100
It says,

54
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,070
Liu Chuan made this tripod

55
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,240
to pray for the king's longevity

56
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,600
and for it to be treasured forever.

57
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,150
Alright, let's keep it simple.

58
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,780
How is this related to our case?

59
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,060
Director Zhao, listen to him.

60
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,260
It's our case.

61
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,660
I didn't lie to you, did I?

62
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,660
Get to the point.

63
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,750
Alright, let me explain first.

64
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,170
What this means is,

65
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,020
there was someone named Liu Chuan

66
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,350
who made a tripod and presented it

67
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,584
to the king as a birthday gift.

68
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,630
It was meant to be cherished forever.

69
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,900
You've seen this tripod

70
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,940
at Zhou Daye's house.

71
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,220
You've even touched it.

72
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,420
(The portrait of Immortal Liu)

73
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:22,930
The tripod at Zhou Daye's house

74
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:23,940
is definitely a fake.

75
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,150
Zhou Daye

76
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,540
is obsessed with alchemy, isn't he?

77
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,460
He uses that tripod for alchemy.

78
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,460
Now think about it.

79
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,700
Isn't the tripod very important?

80
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,070
What does this have to do

81
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,250
with you coming to the museum?

82
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,270
Well,

83
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,300
this tripod is sought after

84
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,540
by relic dealers like Zhou Daye,

85
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,510
yet remains unattainable.

86
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,950
Something this important,

87
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,340
should I come take a look?

88
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,340
I want to see

89
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,220
what key role

90
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,500
this Longevity Tripod plays

91
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,260
in the entire ceremony.

92
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:53,780
I want to see

93
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,820
if we've missed anything.

94
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,380
Then I come over.

95
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,500
But guess what?

96
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,220
This tripod

97
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,750
is a counterfeit.

98
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,070
The tripod in the museum is fake?

99
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,430
Not just this tripod.

100
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,270
Let me tell you, over half the items there

101
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,500
are counterfeits too.

102
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,900
I know the reason behind this.

103
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,070
Usually in museums,

104
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,870
the genuine items are kept in storage.

105
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:16,950
A fake display outside

106
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,190
is for people to visit.

107
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,470
Here's the situation.

108
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,460
When we delivered the tripod,

109
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,480
we asked about it.

110
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,900
They said the museum

111
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,150
didn't have the budget

112
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,360
for a climate-controlled vault.

113
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,820
So all the genuine items

114
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,750
were placed in the exhibition hall.

115
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,390
No, wait.

116
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,870
Let's talk about your actions today.

117
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,030
Alright.

118
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,340
Do you know what this means?

119
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,750
This

120
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,630
means

121
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,500
citizens like me, ardent haters of evil,

122
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,500
have uncovered many

123
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,340
questionable details.

124
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,380
I risk my personal safety

125
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,390
to help the police with their case.

126
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,830
This could also be defined as theft.

127
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,230
Or perhaps, attempted theft.

128
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,340
How could I possibly steal something?

129
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,140
I personally unearthed this tripod myself.

130
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,070
If I wanted to steal it, why wait until now?

131
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,590
At the time,

132
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,260
I felt something was off about this tripod.

133
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,260
But the administrator

134
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,950
said she was about to finish her shift

135
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,460
and the person in charge was away.

136
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,110
And she promptly kicked me out.

137
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,990
Isn't this just a cover-up?

138
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:22,340
So, I had no choice but to take a risky move.

139
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,780
Director Zhao,

140
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,390
how about

141
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,430
going to the museum?

142
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,970
You, come over here.

143
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,970
Leave your fingerprint here.

144
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,310
See? I didn't lie to you.

145
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,750
Just sign it quickly.

146
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,420
Put your fingerprint here.

147
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,220
Alright, let's go.

148
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:56,100
(Police Reception Office;
Registration Office)

149
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,070
Here.

150
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,190
Focus on these specific areas.

151
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,310
Talk to all the girls.

152
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,700
Verify their statements.

153
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,070
We'll need your squad's help.

154
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,070
No problem.

155
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,880
This time,

156
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,010
we need face-to-face contact,

157
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,070
person-to-person.

158
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,180
Undercover works too.

159
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,790
Just don't reveal your identity.

160
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,570
Let's go with this plan.

161
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,980
Xiaoxing,

162
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,010
we will handle this area.

163
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,390
Two bottles of water.

164
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,150
Ten yuan.

165
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,950
Hello. We're the police.

166
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,510
Hello there.

167
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,750
I have a quick question.

168
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,630
Do you have any staff on leave

169
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,650
or female employees

170
00:07:48,674 --> 00:07:49,926
who haven't shown up recently?

171
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,750
No, we don't.

172
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,750
Everyone clocks in for work daily.

173
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,670
No one's been absent.

174
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,300
- Alright.
- Got it.

175
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,180
Thanks a lot.

176
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,390
Stop right there!

177
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,550
Why are you running?

178
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,370
What are you running for?

179
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,830
Stop!

180
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,270
Running again?

181
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,710
Why are you running?

182
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,630
Why are you running?

183
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,300
There are probably around ten of us

184
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,870
who often come here to hang out.

185
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,590
Has anyone suddenly

186
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,190
become unreachable recently

187
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,590
or hasn't come for a long time?

188
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,470
Well...

189
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,860
No, not really.

190
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,030
What's wrong?

191
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,180
It's nothing.

192
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,660
If there's anything unusual,

193
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,580
let us know anytime.

194
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,700
- Sure.
- Got it.

195
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,100
It's just that

196
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,860
I was arrested before.

197
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,100
I have a fear of the police.

198
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,390
I'm a newcomer.

199
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,740
Just a small role here.

200
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,070
I only manage two girls.

201
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,540
You know,

202
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,030
I haven't even earned much yet.

203
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,910
Come with us.

204
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,260
Let's go.

205
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,180
(Shuoyang Yu County Museum)

206
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,980
You're saying this is fake?

207
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,780
Look at the casting line here.

208
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,660
See it?

209
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,940
And these inscriptions

210
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,820
engraved on the sides.

211
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,340
I really can't tell the difference.

212
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,920
Each field has its own experts.

213
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,780
Even Captain Xu can't tell it.

214
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,180
Who's there?

215
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,940
Mr. Zhao.

216
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,940
Sorry about that.

217
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,580
I always trouble you.

218
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,600
Curator Shen, let me introduce someone.

219
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,220
This's Captain Xu from the Major Crimes Unit.

220
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,100
A true defender of the people.

221
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,100
Pleasure to meet you.

222
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,420
Pleasure to meet you.

223
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,260
And this is

224
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,140
Chen.

225
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,660
Hello.

226
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,460
You're Professor Han's student, right?

227
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,660
Yes, I'm Chen Nan.

228
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,660
I know you.

229
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,260
You brought this tripod last year, right?

230
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,300
That's right.

231
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,270
Professor Han often praises you,

232
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,700
saying that you

233
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,070
are not inferior to men.

234
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,660
Curator Shen,

235
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,540
she stole something.

236
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:58,910
Quiet!

237
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,610
She's the one who brought this here.

238
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,430
Why would she need to steal it?

239
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,100
Curator, she claims this is fake.

240
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,510
You all seem to lack common sense.

241
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,220
She delivered this herself,

242
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,920
then filed a report saying it's fake?

243
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,660
There must be a misunderstanding.

244
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,700
Curator Shen,

245
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,300
everyone's quite busy.

246
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,820
Let's talk about something real.

247
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:22,940
Alright.

248
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,110
Let's chat over here.

249
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,220
Come on.

250
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,110
I just set this up.

251
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,340
It's a bit messy here.

252
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,070
Come on, Director Zhao.

253
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,780
Here, please have some tea.

254
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,220
Are you absolutely sure

255
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,040
that the tripod is fake?

256
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,660
I'm certain.

257
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,220
That's really strange.

258
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,430
What's so strange about it?

259
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,780
Ever since you brought it here,

260
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,270
it has been sitting there untouched.

261
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,820
But now,

262
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,460
- well...
- Are you saying

263
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,100
that I brought a counterfeit here?

264
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,940
I found it odd back then.

265
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,030
It's such a precious artifact.

266
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,820
How could they lend it

267
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,460
to a private museum so easily?

268
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,340
It's exactly as they say,

269
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,740
city life is full of tricks.

270
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,940
Curator,

271
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,820
all the items we delivered

272
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,030
were verified by experts.

273
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,460
You signed off on them,

274
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,820
didn't you?

275
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,700
Of course.

276
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,390
But now,

277
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,910
you're putting all the blame on me.

278
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,820
There's one thing I can confirm.

279
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,220
That tripod is a high-quality replica

280
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,620
from a traditional workshop.

281
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,030
I examined your collection closely.

282
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,370
It's a mix of real and fake items.

283
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,580
I'm not questioning your expertise.

284
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,390
You're indeed very skilled.

285
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:44,900
Many of the items

286
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,460
look real enough to fool anyone.

287
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,220
But I could spot something off.

288
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,740
Sir,

289
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,460
I'm now filing a real-name report.

290
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,510
I hope the police will investigate.

291
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,540
If that's the case,

292
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,420
sir,

293
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,860
I'd also like to report something.

294
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,390
Why is the artifact she sent over

295
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,300
a counterfeit?

296
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,150
And now,

297
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,010
we're being accused

298
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,670
of being the ones who made the counterfeit.

299
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,780
Alright, listen to me.

300
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,540
Curator Shen,

301
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,740
we're handling a big case.

302
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,270
I haven't slept in over ten hours.

303
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,430
All the comrades in our team

304
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,680
are also working tirelessly,

305
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,700
and waiting on me to coordinate things.

306
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,940
I drove two hours

307
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,820
to get to this place.

308
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,460
I'm definitely not here

309
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,230
to listen to you argue

310
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,350
about the authenticity of a tripod.

311
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,060
Frankly, I don't care

312
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,460
about its authenticity.

313
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,340
But if you traffic cultural relics,

314
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,110
then I can tell you

315
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,150
what I'm going to do next.

316
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,340
First, I'll close this museum right away.

317
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,180
Second, the police

318
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,060
will go to each of your homes

319
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:58,940
or the office space,

320
00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,820
and take you away.

321
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,390
Third, I'll invite

322
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,580
the best industry experts

323
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,700
to conduct a thorough evaluation here.

324
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,180
So there's no need for disputes.

325
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,270
Everyone will be questioned.

326
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,540
Fourth,

327
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,340
I'll investigate

328
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,450
your bank transactions,

329
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,540
call records,

330
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,580
spending history,

331
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,740
everything.

332
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,650
Take this watch for example.

333
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:17,900
How did you get it?

334
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,940
If you bought it,

335
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,580
how much did it cost and where?

336
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,700
If it was a gift,

337
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,660
who gave it to you?

338
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,820
And how did they get it?

339
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,940
Everything will be checked.

340
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,920
No one can escape this.

341
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,750
In short,

342
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,350
if any of you have secrets

343
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,940
you wish to keep hidden,

344
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:31,990
I'm sorry,

345
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,940
once I start investigating,

346
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,270
then it won't be a secret anymore.

347
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:35,990
Understand?

348
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,660
All personnel

349
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,420
related to major cases

350
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,780
will be dealt with by the police,

351
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,660
no leniency.

352
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:50,910
Curator Shen,

353
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,100
you're a respected figure.

354
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,320
Your staff are young and inexperienced.

355
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,670
They have a long future ahead.

356
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,940
That's all I'll say for now.

357
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:02,940
Those who confess

358
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,700
will earn significant merit.

359
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,300
Those who don't

360
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,520
will face consequences as I stated.

361
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,900
Sir,

362
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,970
I want to report something.

363
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,340
It's him. He sold all the authentic ones.

364
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,790
This area is an urban village,

365
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,470
with a complex mix of residents.

366
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,270
The local police station

367
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,680
reported there may be

368
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,820
some people engaged

369
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,200
in illegal activities in this area.

370
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,660
Hurry up, give me the money!

371
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,320
Why did you sell so little alcohol?

372
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,980
Where's your friend Ding Dang?

373
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,560
When will she give me the money?

374
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,660
What's wrong?

375
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,010
Still not feeling better?

376
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,660
I'm warning you,

377
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,090
if she delays another day,

378
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,700
the amount will change tomorrow.

379
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,160
Are you driving us insane?

380
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,460
If you don't want to work,

381
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,700
I'll send you to do something else.

382
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,300
Let go of me!

383
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:54,750
Let go!

384
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,510
Move now!

385
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,390
Let go!

386
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,470
- Not listening, huh?
- Police.

387
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,420
You'll regret it...

388
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,300
How dare you!

389
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,900
Don't move.

390
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,920
Sir, I didn't do anything!

391
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,300
Be honest.

392
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,540
- Sir...
- Don't move!

393
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,780
I did nothing!

394
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,060
- Dafei!
- I'm here.

395
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,300
Keep an eye on him.

396
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,100
Don't move! Stay put!

397
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,700
Stop running.

398
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,910
Sir,

399
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,310
I swear I did nothing!

400
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,910
Come with me.

401
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,030
Let me buy medicine for my roommate first.

402
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,510
What medicine?

403
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,580
Life-saving medicine.

404
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,300
Let's go.

405
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,550
Where do you live? Take me there.

406
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,310
I live right here.

407
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:21,630
Ding Dang.

408
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,870
Ding Dang!

409
00:17:24,894 --> 00:17:25,646
Ding Dang!

410
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,470
Ding Dang!

411
00:17:26,494 --> 00:17:27,394
Ding Dang!

412
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,870
Leave here.

413
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:04,910
Dad.

414
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,220
Dad.

415
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,100
Dafei.

416
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:47,980
How's it going?

417
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,550
Check if this guy is sick.

418
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,740
What happened?

419
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,340
He poked me with a needle.

420
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,460
Let me see.

421
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:58,060
I'll arrange a blood test right away.

422
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:02,790
Come here.

423
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,630
It's fine. Come out.

424
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,390
Come out.

425
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:10,870
It's fine.

426
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:14,540
Come out.

427
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,420
Let me do it.

428
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,150
Let me.

429
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,020
Don't be scared.

430
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,550
We're the police.

431
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,540
You were so brave.

432
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,510
Thank you.

433
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,390
Come here.

434
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,310
Come on.

435
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:58,910
Here.

436
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,260
Don't be afraid.

437
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:07,960
We're all police officers.

438
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,840
Take her back to the station.

439
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,340
Have the coroners check her

440
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,320
and collect the evidence.

441
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,940
There are still something

442
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,950
we'll need your help with.

443
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,110
Let's go.

444
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,620
Ticket sales are terrible.

445
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,460
So...

446
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,380
Sometimes we can't even pay wages.

447
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,470
I had no choice but to sell them.

448
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,100
I made a counterfeit first

449
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,380
and then

450
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,140
sold the genuine one for profit.

451
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,900
This place is so remote. No one comes here.

452
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:25,670
Occasionally,

453
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:26,750
the school organizes visits

454
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,870
for primary school students.

455
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,800
Who would've thought

456
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,160
a female expert would visit today,

457
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,380
and cause such a stir.

458
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,500
Curator Shen,

459
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,750
how many years have you been doing this?

460
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,340
How many items have you sold?

461
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,840
How much illegal profit have you made?

462
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,660
About

463
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,030
14 years.

464
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,660
Around 40 to 50 items.

465
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,270
About several million.

466
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,310
That tripod we just saw,

467
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,040
who did you sell it to?

468
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,950
Seems like it was a young man

469
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,380
in his twenties.

470
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,010
What's his exact identity?

471
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,710
I don't know.

472
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,710
I was on duty in the lobby that day.

473
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:13,590
Curator Shen.

474
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,180
He showed up.

475
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,420
Who are you?

476
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,630
You don't know me.

477
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,180
I don't know you either.

478
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:20,550
But I want

479
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,590
(Chungwa cigarette)
to restock from you.

480
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,900
You don't have a single acquaintance

481
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,680
between you two, yet you dare to sell it?

482
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,330
Can't say there're no acquaintances.

483
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,150
Without acquaintances,

484
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,100
he wouldn't have found me.

485
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,420
Someone like me

486
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:37,580
is ideal for this.

487
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,050
Clear money and goods exchange.

488
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,480
Each went their separate ways.

489
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,730
The Yu Kingdom's tripod,

490
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,260
50,000.

491
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,720
When was it sold?

492
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,340
About half a year ago.

493
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,570
Did that person ever call you?

494
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,420
No, he didn't.

495
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,960
We've never been in contact.

496
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,030
Every time, it was always

497
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,750
a cash transaction.

498
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:59,820
No records at all.

499
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:01,580
We arranged the next meeting

500
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,270
during the meeting.

501
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,660
This person is key to our case.

502
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,240
I have to find this person.

503
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,780
Think carefully again.

504
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,380
Don't overlook any details.

505
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,630
I remember.

506
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,550
I've seen him once.

507
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:21,990
He took off his sunglasses.

508
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,990
That guy might be an addict.

509
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,380
Alright, don't draw the hair anymore.

510
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,670
Let me add some color.

511
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,020
- No need.
- It'll look better.

512
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:38,870
Does it look like him?

513
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,140
It's 90% similar.

514
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,240
He's specialized in oil painting.

515
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,740
A top student from the art institute.

516
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,660
Yeah, I even won a few awards...

517
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,750
Let's not talk about that now.

518
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,790
Can I ask

519
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,410
if this counts as a contribution?

520
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,700
Director Zhao.

521
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,030
Keep them here for now.

522
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,580
- Help me watch them.
- Sure.

523
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,050
The museum is officially sealed now.

524
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,540
And these counterfeit items

525
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,860
will be confiscated as evidence.

526
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:12,750
I'll send someone over to handle it.

527
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,020
Thanks.

528
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,340
Leave...

529
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,230
Leave a memento.

530
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,440
The prettier the employees are,

531
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:24,900
the more trouble they cause.

532
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,180
Trouble, indeed.

533
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:29,620
Your words sounded pretty sharp earlier.

534
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,620
What were you thinking?

535
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,060
Sneaking into a museum?

536
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:34,990
Weren't you scared?

537
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,510
With you here, what's there to fear?

538
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:39,270
If I weren't around, would you still do it?

539
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,470
I'll still do like that.

540
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,150
Do you think we can recover the tripod?

541
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,180
Curator Shen sketched a portrait.

542
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,670
According to him, this person is an addict.

543
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:50,650
That makes things easier.

544
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:52,660
I can check with the Narcotics Squad

545
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,940
or the Rehabilitation Center for leads.

546
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,420
This clue is valuable for us.

547
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:57,170
It suggests

548
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:58,756
Zhou Daye might not be the main culprit.

549
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:59,660
Think about it.

550
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,580
He can't even get the real tripod

551
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,720
and have to rely on replicas.

552
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,380
I've always had a feeling.

553
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,300
If the secret behind the Longevity Ritual

554
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,380
is uncovered,

555
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,820
your case will be solved too.

556
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,620
Do you remember

557
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,590
there was a painting

558
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,770
in Zhou Daye's secret chamber?

559
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:16,910
No, I don't remember.

560
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,470
The portrait of Immortal Liu.

561
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,100
Back then, I always thought

562
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,860
the character Liu in the name

563
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,070
meant to leave behind.

564
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,820
After I thought it over,

565
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,910
the character Liu should refer to Liu Chuan,

566
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:29,420
the High Priest of the Yu Kingdom.

567
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,560
(The portrait of Immortal Liu)

568
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,580
The person in the painting might be him.

569
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:36,470
Zhou Daye hung this painting in his home.

570
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:39,030
Because Liu Chuan is the inventor

571
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:41,230
of the Longevity Ritual and also the tripod.

572
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:44,230
Is it possible that Zhou Daye sees Liu Chuan

573
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,710
as a god he deeply admires?

574
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,820
Speaking of ancient rulers,

575
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,860
like Emperor Qin,

576
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,620
they were educated people.

577
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,860
Yet they still fell for these tricks.

578
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,230
Ancient rulers

579
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,300
held power and authority.

580
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,140
They were obsessed with seeking immortality

581
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,420
to unify their kingdoms forever.

582
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,580
For those emperors,

583
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,670
the pursuit of immortality

584
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:11,180
seemed like an eternal obsession.

585
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,270
In my opinion, life is precious

586
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,790
precisely because it's fleeting.

587
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,480
If we achieved immortality,

588
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,170
everything would become dull.

589
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,710
Quite profound.

590
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:40,580
(Shuoyang Yu County Museum)

591
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,020
What's up, Dafei?

592
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,980
Captain, where are you?

593
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,150
I'm on my way back.

594
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,100
We had a mission today

595
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,390
and got some results.

596
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:07,100
Lin wants you to come back quickly.

597
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:09,070
Alright, I'll head back now.

598
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,150
Let me go with you.

599
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,860
I've got nothing to do at home anyway.

600
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,900
The time was about...

601
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,710
a week ago.

602
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,580
It rained that night.

603
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,030
Business was slow.

604
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,510
So I went home early.

605
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,620
Didn't expect when I started...

606
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,150
Alright, alright.

607
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,510
It's fine, it's fine now.

608
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:48,910
Everything's fine.

609
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,740
It's nothing.

610
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:51,940
Alright.

611
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:01,940
Headphones?

612
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:20,590
All set.

613
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:13,070
Go on.

614
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,950
Ding Dang, what happened to your leg?

615
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,260
Take a seat, quickly.

616
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:28,550
Be careful.

617
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,740
Take it slow.

618
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:31,980
Sit here.

619
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,580
Where did you hurt your leg?

620
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:41,910
It's fine now.

621
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,390
It's fine.

622
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,420
We dare not call the police.

623
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,710
I just tried to calm her down.

624
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,470
She was absolutely terrified.

625
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,660
At first, she said nothing.

626
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,750
Later, she calmed down a bit

627
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,070
and shared a rough idea.

628
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,340
It was two men.

629
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:13,990
She said they are wearing

630
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:15,900
dark hoodies.

631
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,420
Are you serious?

632
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,410
It's all about the ritual.

633
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,710
She won't die, right?

634
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,750
No, she'll be fine.

635
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,030
You're insane.

636
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,750
You guys need to recall everything carefully,

637
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,580
including the license plate number,

638
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,140
location where the car was parked,

639
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,140
details about the murder,

640
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:30,870
their accent,

641
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:32,330
age and appearance.

642
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:33,830
Anything.

643
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,230
You can't just stay silent.

644
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:40,750
She didn't say anything.

645
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,820
She's been hiding under the bed all day

646
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:44,860
and refused talk to anyone.

647
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,310
I'm the only one bringing her food.

648
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,380
Then a few days later,

649
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:51,990
we heard rumors

650
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,580
about someone targeting girls

651
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,660
from out of town like us.

652
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:00,270
We were scared to death,

653
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,790
and didn't dare to go to work.

654
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:06,790
Later...

655
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,500
What happened then?

656
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:11,830
Later,

657
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:14,990
they saw she was of no use anymore,

658
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,700
so they decided to sell her.

659
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,540
Then,

660
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,030
they took turns playing with her.

661
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:34,190
Animals!

662
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,030
It's clear this was a group crime.

663
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:41,620
How did you two meet?

664
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:43,510
We met at the hair salon.

665
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,740
When she was in eighth grade,

666
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,390
her dad worked at a construction site

667
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:48,610
and passed away in an accident.

668
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,620
Not long after that,

669
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:53,100
her mom remarried and abandoned her.

670
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:54,590
So she dropped out of school.

671
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:56,990
From what she told me,

672
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,780
after her dad passed away,

673
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,950
she was abused by her uncle.

674
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:04,030
So she came here from the county.

675
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,620
She worked at the hair salon for a year.

676
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:10,550
She's quite attractive.

677
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,700
But she was abused

678
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:14,230
and harassed by others.

679
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,030
What's her real name?

680
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,540
Ding Zhenzhen.

681
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,580
She later changed her name

682
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,460
to Ding Dang.

683
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:24,870
Lin,

684
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,700
you need to make her recall clues

685
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:29,510
that can help us.

686
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,140
Don't be afraid.

687
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,430
We are the police,

688
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,090
specifically catching bad people.

689
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,950
I know it's been tough for you.

690
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,700
But you still need to try your best

691
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,140
to recall anything you can, alright?

692
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,660
It will really help us if you do.

693
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:05,990
This car is crucial.

694
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:07,220
The color of the car,

695
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,680
the license plate number...

696
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,640
Even if you can't remember the whole thing,

697
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,700
try to recall a number,

698
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,470
or even one letter, that helps us.

699
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,020
And what are their characteristics?

700
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,260
What color were their clothes?

701
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,130
Did they have a beard?

702
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:22,080
Any scars on their face?

703
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,060
What did they look like?

704
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,910
Even a vague description will do.

705
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,510
Do you understand?

706
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:27,610
You can't remember anything?

707
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:28,450
That can't be, right?

708
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,420
It's alright.

709
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:38,870
Alright, alright.

710
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,260
It's okay, it's okay.

711
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:43,510
It's fine. It's fine.

712
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,710
Everything's alright.

713
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,470
Take it slow.

714
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:48,510
Easy, take it slow.

715
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:50,540
Take it slow.

716
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,310
Take it slow. Have a seat.

717
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,060
Take it slow.

718
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:54,910
Come on, sit.

719
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:55,850
Slowly, take your time.

720
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:56,870
It's fine, really.

721
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:57,940
It's fine.

722
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,060
You're safe, no worries.

723
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,910
No one can hurt you here.

724
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,260
This is a safe place.

725
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:05,830
Hey, open the doors and windows.

726
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:06,870
Let her get some fresh air.

727
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:12,100
This is a PTSD Response.

728
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,930
It's common after being injured.

729
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,790
She can't handle any more stress right now.

730
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:16,670
No questioning either.

731
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:18,510
It's best to find a quiet place

732
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,780
or a place where she feels safe

733
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,870
for her to stay for a while.

734
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:24,870
Are you serious?

735
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,580
You know about this?

736
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,700
Back in college,

737
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,910
I minored in psychology.

738
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:35,200
How could you ask questions like that?

739
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,020
You're just stressing her out more.

740
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,420
Lin.

741
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:04,350
If we want to take her in, we must

742
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,680
conduct a full examination on her.

743
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:08,540
- I'll send her there.
- Alright.

744
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,790
Also, do me a favor.

745
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:10,840
Get medicine from my place.

746
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,470
No problem, I'll get it for you.

747
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:13,400
Where did you leave it?

748
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:14,650
I'll have someone bring it downstairs.

749
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,020
Alright, no problem.

750
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,420
Thanks.

751
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:20,670
Xiaoxing.

752
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:21,790
Dafei.

753
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:24,790
Take the picture of the portrait

754
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:26,060
I sent you to the Narcotics Squad

755
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,390
and check if anyone they've caught

756
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,140
- look like that person.
- Got it.

757
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,260
Send people to the Rehabilitation Centers.

758
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:33,170
Make sure you find this person's whereabouts.

759
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,180
And tomorrow,

760
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,170
take some people with you

761
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,700
to the Yu County Museum.

762
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,260
Alright.

763
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,200
- That's it.
- Got it.

764
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,100
Lin.

765
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:50,620
Lin.

766
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,900
I go to get your medicine.

767
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:53,780
I leave this to you.

768
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,470
Zhang.

769
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:25,350
Stop the car.

770
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,350
Thanks for that.

771
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:29,510
Just give me the stuff.

772
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:31,140
I need to go with you.

773
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:32,260
That's not necessary.

774
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,260
I can handle it myself.

775
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,070
He can't take care of himself at all.

776
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:36,390
I have to go personally.

777
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:38,350
Start driving.

778
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,060
(Laboratory)

779
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:57,310
Miss,

780
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:58,760
we're going to deal with those jerks.

781
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,870
So we need to keep your clothes for testing.

782
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:01,940
This lady here

783
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,740
will get you clean clothes.

784
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,060
Alright?

785
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,540
Wang, upload the photos.

786
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,420
Got it.

787
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:12,710
Lin,

788
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:13,910
the tests are done.

789
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,170
The liquid in the syringe

790
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:16,260
doesn't contain HIV

791
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,430
or any other infectious virus.

792
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:18,330
Thank you.

793
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,200
Rest assured.

794
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,350
Based on the test report earlier,

795
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,620
there are over 20 injuries,

796
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:33,990
mild to moderate,

797
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:35,390
signs of blunt trauma on the head,

798
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,230
and mild

799
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:38,270
vaginal tear.

800
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:39,930
Unstable psychological state.

801
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:40,870
Low blood sugar.

802
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:41,750
Severe exhaustion.

803
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:43,310
As for whether there're other diseases,

804
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:44,240
we can know it tomorrow.

805
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,030
The photo of the back injury,

806
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,700
can you retake it more clearly?

807
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:58,310
