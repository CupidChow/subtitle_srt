=Episode 5=

3
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,360
I'm sorry.

4
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,210
I failed to protect our daughter.

5
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,840
- Hi, I'm looking for Captain Xu.
- Hello.

6
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,600
Captain Xu.

7
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,490
Someone's here to see you.

8
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:49,930
Who is it?

9
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,320
Have some Chrysanthemum Tea to cool down.

10
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,680
Thanks.

11
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,640
I came here today

12
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,890
to express my gratitude to you.

13
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,330
For what?

14
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,130
Thank you

15
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,210
for giving me new insights

16
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,240
into my work.

17
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:13,850
Before this,

18
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,040
we always assumed

19
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,850
the king of Ancient Yu Kingdom

20
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,170
died in chaos or war.

21
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,760
But your words last time inspired me.

22
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,200
Can I still inspire you, Doctor?

23
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,280
Think about it.

24
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,240
If the king truly became immortal,

25
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,320
what would happen when his son
wanted the throne?

26
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
What could he do then?

27
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,930
Usurpation, of course.

28
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,480
Exactly.

29
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,120
So we conducted new tests

30
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,240
on the remains of the king

31
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,050
and discovered

32
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,290
suspicious knife wounds

33
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,610
on his ribs.

34
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,730
In the last 20 years of the Kingdom,

35
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,930
there were four coups.

36
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,400
This is quite unusual in history.

37
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,120
So we now speculate

38
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,250
this was the reason.

39
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,290
The so-called immortality technique

40
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,410
turned into the curse of immortality.

41
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:03,370
Isn't it ironic?

42
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,350
I really need to thank you for this.

43
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,240
No, no,

44
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,160
no need to thank me.

45
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,880
If your investigation efforts

46
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,130
can help our case,

47
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,810
we should be thanking you.

48
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,290
You know,

49
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,970
your perspective on things

50
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,200
is truly unique.

51
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:22,470
It's just

52
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,130
a characteristic of this profession.

53
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,240
But at the end of the day,

54
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,880
the whole usurpation thing

55
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,360
is definitely discouraged, isn't it?

56
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,610
Now, the Ancient Yu Kingdom

57
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,490
has turned into quite the mystery.

58
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,880
The so-called immortality technique,

59
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,490
what exactly is written

60
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:41,930
on that tortoise shell,

61
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,900
and how is the immortality technique

62
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,000
implemented,

63
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,080
are becoming more worth studying.

64
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,880
How's your case going?

65
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,200
I haven't seen Lin around.

66
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,130
Oh, Lin...

67
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,720
Lin is sick.

68
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:00,650
He's resting at home.

69
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,640
I was just thinking

70
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,840
to check on him later.

71
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,080
I'll go with you.

72
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,810
I just want to thank him.

73
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,240
You still want to thank him?

74
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,120
Thank him for hiring me

75
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,690
as your consultant.

76
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,030
Well, indeed.

77
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,350
That's a decision made by the committee.

78
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,560
These things you bought aren't suitable.

79
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,860
They're all for older folks.

80
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,420
Do you know what seniors dislike most?

81
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,750
What seniors dislike the most is

82
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,260
you see him as an old man.

83
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,800
Who doesn't want to stay young forever?

84
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,020
You don't get it.

85
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,340
At Lin's age,

86
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,700
practicality is what matters.

87
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,780
That's just you.

88
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,380
(Archaeological Discoveries in China)

89
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,860
Lin!

90
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,180
- What's going on?
- Lin.

91
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,180
Why are you so loud?

92
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:32,920
Your hands don't hurt,

93
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,220
but I'm worried about the door!

94
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,740
- No manners at all.
- Sorry, sorry.

95
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,820
Behave yourself.

96
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,340
Who are you looking for?

97
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,220
I... we're here to see Lin Guoqiang.

98
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,820
Who are you?

99
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,860
I... I'm his colleague.

100
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,300
Here, this is my ID.

101
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,020
How about yours?

102
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,340
I... I came to check on him.

103
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,740
I told you to be gentle.

104
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,380
- Gentle!
- Okay, okay!

105
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,660
He's still not awake.

106
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,820
Sorry about that.

107
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,300
Wait, you have the key?

108
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,900
Oh, you're awake.

109
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,780
Does your head hurt?

110
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,220
Why did you drink so much?

111
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,240
You can't drink like this.

112
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,060
- Come in!
- It is bad for you.

113
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,740
Your colleague came to see you.

114
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,380
- Hurry up, come in!
- Come in.

115
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,540
Did you drink the water

116
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,460
I left on the table?

117
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,780
Yes, I drank it.

118
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,300
Come, have a seat.

119
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,380
She's my neighbor.

120
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,300
Hello.

121
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,460
Have a seat.

122
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,340
Anywhere is fine.

123
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,380
Go ahead, sit down.

124
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,300
You should change your clothes.

125
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,720
I washed your dirty clothes

126
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,820
and dried them too.

127
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,040
They're right by the bedside.

128
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:45,580
Alright.

129
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,500
Okay.

130
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,500
I'll leave you alone.

131
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,420
Alright.

132
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,100
Did you get any results

133
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,420
from the one we caught yesterday?

134
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,860
Nothing yet.

135
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,620
Lin, I... I need to ask you

136
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,300
if you are hiding something from me.

137
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,780
It's that case from ten years ago.

138
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,660
The murderer seemed to deal antiques,

139
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,520
but was actually a tomb robber.

140
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,660
His surname was Zhou.

141
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,780
He's called Zhou Jiahei.

142
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,900
So, you suspect this Zhou Daming

143
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,060
is

144
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,620
somehow connected

145
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,060
to that murderer Zhou Jiahei, right?

146
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,580
Even shady practices can be passed down.

147
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,300
Maybe he's a fish that got away.

148
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,180
No wonder you're so worked up.

149
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,620
But you're right.

150
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,440
- We shouldn't rush in.
- Never mind.

151
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,380
What's the next move?

152
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,260
We caught that guy already,

153
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,660
but he's tight-lipped.

154
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:41,940
At least we know

155
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,780
Zhou Daming is from Zhouli Village.

156
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,380
Go to Zhouli Village.

157
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,180
Zhouli Village?

158
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,420
Seems like Zhouli Village is

159
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,140
a hub for tomb robbers.

160
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,100
Take me with you.

161
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,580
We're handling the investigation.

162
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,760
Is it appropriate to take you?

163
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,860
Take her with us.

164
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,860
Chen is the expert here.

165
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,900
She might uncover something new.

166
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,220
Got it!

167
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,420
Lin,

168
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,340
I made porridge for you.

169
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,260
Hurry and drink it.

170
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,940
He's changing his clothes.

171
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,780
Ms., can I have a bowl too?

172
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,900
I only made one bowl.

173
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,940
This is Zhou Daming's house.

174
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,500
Zhou Daming lives right here.

175
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,900
He's a really odd person.

176
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,460
He loves living in high places

177
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,540
and avoids contacting anyone in the village.

178
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,060
Feel free to look around.

179
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,300
No one lives here anyway.

180
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,380
Alright.

181
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,860
Don't touch things randomly.

182
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,540
We have gloves too.

183
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,420
That stone lion of his

184
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,500
is from the Ming Dynasty

185
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,660
and so is this one.

186
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,300
Do you know Zhou Daming well?

187
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,120
He's got quite a temper

188
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,270
and loves to fight and drink.

189
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,420
I heard he even scared his wife away.

190
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,640
Doesn't he live in the village?

191
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,300
No, he doesn't.

192
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,660
I heard he got jailed for digging up tombs.

193
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,420
Later, he set up a chicken farm outside.

194
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,700
Now he lives over there

195
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,700
and rarely comes back.

196
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:05,650
How about you stay here?

197
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:06,820
I'll go check out the farm.

198
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,740
I'll go too.

199
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,560
I'll come along.

200
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,620
Show me where it is.

201
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,540
Over there.

202
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,340
Over the hill?

203
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,260
No, just there.

207
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,740
all have the surname Zhou?

208
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,420
Yes, we've been here for 300 years.

00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,740
Take me there.

How many people live in your village?

213
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,300
Our village has about

214
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,270
less than 400 households,

215
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,180
around 1,160 people in total.

216
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,940
This is our ancestral hall.

217
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,780
It's a place of ancestral worship.

someone is looking for you.

Grandpa!

221
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,260
Keep your voice down.

222
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,500
- Grandpa.
- That's so rude.

223
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,820
This is an police officer from the city,

225

Hello.

- Let me help you.
- Hello.

227
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,540

Zhou Daming.

234
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,700

237
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,940
Such a disgraceful act.

238
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,940
Just arrest him directly.

239
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,780
Why do you need the genealogy?

240
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,900
We suspect

241
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,420
it's a group operation.

242
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:22,980
I see.

275
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,070
Zhou Jiahei.

276
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,020
I know him.

277
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,660
He passed away long ago.

278
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,020
A troublemaker.

279
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,420
A murderer.

280
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,700
A disgrace to the family.

281
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,100
I originally disagreed with him

282
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,700
being included in the family genealogy.

283
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,940
But his father

284
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,260
threatened me with his life.

285
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,300
Forget it.

286
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,880
So his name was written in.

287
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,210
Based on the family genealogy,

288
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,380
Zhou Daming

289
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,140
is Zhou Jiahei's nephew.

290
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,420
That's right.

291
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,580
Zhou Daming's grandfather

292
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,140
and Zhou Jiahei's father

293
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,100
were blood brothers.

294
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,020
Jiahei had no descendants.

295
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,140
And Zhou Daming's father passed early.

296
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,420
His mother remarried.

297
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,220
So Zhou Daming followed Jiahei growing up.

298
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,300

As expected,

301
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,820
he still learned some bad habits.

302
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,380
Why is it so smelly here?

303
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,140
Talk less, breathe less.

304
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,940
Excuse me.

00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,780
Hello? Captain Xu.

306
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,660

307
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,320
I've discovered something here.

308
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,640
I'll send you the location now.

309
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,140
Alright, I'll be there shortly.

310
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,540
Thank you, sir.

311
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,620
No need to thank me.

313
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,860
if someone in the clan

314
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,140
acts unlawfully,

315
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,380
we

316
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,620
appreciate you

317
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,820
keeping our clan

318
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,900
disciplined.

319
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,300
By the way,

320
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,500
I wanted to ask

321
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,620
why Zhou Jiahei doesn't have kids.

322
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,820
Digging up tombs

323
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,180
harms his moral character.

324
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,900
He deserves it.

325
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,460
Take care.

326
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,820
Take care.

327
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,740
Alright.

328
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,900
Go see him off.

329
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,900
So senseless.

330
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,220
It's a cicada.

331
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:41,980
Where did it come from?

332
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,020
Found it under the pillow.

333
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,380
Let me tell you, this design

334
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,620
has a special meaning.

335
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,420
But I advise you

336
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,960
not to take it with your hands.

337
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:52,940
Why not?

338
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,780
This thing

339
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,700
is a burial object.

340
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,940
Look. It is carved

341
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,660
in the shape of a cicada.

342
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,860
It symbolizes transformation and ascension.

343
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,860
This kind of thing

344
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,140
is usually worn close to the body.

345
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,100
Can I go in for another look?

346
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,140
No, no, no.

347
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,300
It might be a crime scene now.

348
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,460
You can't go in.

349
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,060
What is this?

350
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,340
Where did you find it?

351
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,020
Under Zhou Daming's pillow.

352
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,420
Don't take it with your hands.

353
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,300
It's him.

354
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,380
The one who attacked me that night

355
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,700
was carrying this item.

356
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,460
Right, you mentioned it.

357
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,420
Ten years ago,

358
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,380
the suicide suspect Zhou Jiahei

359
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,540
is the uncle

360
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,620
of Zhou Daming.

361
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,420
Zhou Daming was raised by him.

362
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,020
When Zhou Jiahei died,

363
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,860
he was holding this in his hand.

364
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,140
These are a pair?

365
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:11,940
Daming.

366
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,420
Daming.

367
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,380
Da...

368
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,520
Who are you looking for?

369
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,400
I'm looking for Zhou Daming to restock.

370
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,460
Who are you?

371
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,380
Come here.

372
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,820
We're the police.

373
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,300
Officer Xu.

374
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,580
What happened to Zhou Daming?

375
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,580
Did something happen?

376
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,540
He ran away?

377
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,140
I knew it.

378
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,240
I've told him so many times

379
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,580
that he can't gamble;

380
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,760
it was bound to cause trouble.

381
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,680
He didn't listen to me.

382
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,680
Now look, trouble's here.

383
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:50,620
I even prepaid him

384
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,900
three months of goods payment.

385
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,500
And now it's all gone.

386
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,260
Darn it!

387
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,860
I'm not scolding you.

388
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,260
What's your name?

389
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:04,670
I'm

390
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:05,740
Hu Xiaomin.

391
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,180
I run a fresh good supermarket.

392
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,980
(Fresh Every Day)
I get some fresh frozen chickens and eggs

393
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,400
(Hu Xiaomin)
from him monthly.

394
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,280
How long have you known Zhou Daming?

395
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,300
Over two years.

396
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,020
Not quite three years yet.

397
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,360
I've been sourcing goods from him.

398
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,180
How did you meet?

399
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,780
We didn't know each other before.

400
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,720
I knew his wife first.

401
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,880
His wife introduced us later.

402
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,820
That's how we met.

403
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,020
Where did his wife go?

404
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,740
She left early on.

405
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,420
Later, she met another guy,

406
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,380
and then took all his money away.

407
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,500
We can find you at this address, right?

408
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,420
Yes, definitely.

409
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,340
Anytime.

410
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,420
Captain.

411
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,740
Inside.

412
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,660
Alright.

413
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,260
Okay, here's the plan.

414
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,120
We'll go to you

415
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:44,220
to get more details, alright?

416
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,140
Anytime.

417
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,340
Please go ahead. I'm off.

418
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,060
Do you know about Zhou Daming

419
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:51,980
and the tomb raiding?

420
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,420
No, I don't.

421
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,320
Officer,

422
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:57,260
after you find him,

423
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,820
make him return my money.

424
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,420
You go ahead.

425
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,860
(Blood stains on the cutting board)
The forensic analysis shows

426
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,060
at the scene, apart from chicken blood,

427
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,100
most of it is human blood.

428
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,700
(Jade cicada on Zhou Daming's bed)

429
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,820
This is

430
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,760
a jade cicada found

431
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,980
under Zhou Daming's pillow.

432
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:19,820
It's a pendant.

433
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,700
Lin mentioned,

434
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,420
during his fight with the man in black,

435
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,660
he noticed something hanging

436
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,220
around the man's neck, just like this.

437
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,500
Lin also discovered

438
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,500
that Zhou Daming

439
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,260
is the nephew of Zhou Jiahei,

440
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,420
the main suspect of 10/13 Case.

441
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,020
Everyone,

442
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,220
today, we finally

443
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,500
see a glimmer of hope.

444
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,220
If the DNA comparison

445
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,340
shows no discrepancies,

446
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,500
then we can confirm it's Zhou Daming.

447
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,900
But, Captain,

448
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,740
the torso is still missing right now.

449
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,420
Stick to this approach.

450
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,700
We'll definitely find it.

451
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,100
Exactly.

452
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,260
Let's leave the follow-up work

453
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,900
to the Technical and Forensic Department.

454
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,380
Guo, I'll leave it yo you.

455
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,820
Alright then,

456
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,820
everyone can go home

457
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:58,940
and get some rest.

458
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,340
Lin, you've been working all day.

459
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,440
Go home and get some rest.

460
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,700
Ms. Chen,

461
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,860

462
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,680

will treat you to dinner.

465
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,780
Then I want something fancy.

466
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,100
Sure, no problem.

467
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,220

(Photos of Zhou Daming's chicken farm)

What is it, Ms. Chen?

500
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,740
There are something I can't figure out.

501
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,020
I want to discuss it with you.

502
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,060
It's about Zhou Daming's family.

503
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,860
What happened?

504
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,100
At Zhou Daming's house,

505
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,500
there isn't a single book

506
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,060
above a middle school reading level,

507
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,980
no materials on Chinese traditions,

508
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,440
like Eight Trigrams theories,

509
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,700
Yin-Yang or Feng Shui practices,

510
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,180
or burial customs and rituals.

511
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,020
So, I feel this person

512
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,540
doesn't have the knowledge base

513
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,780
to handle this case.

514
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,340
I've been thinking about that too.

515
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,660
Think about it.

516
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,460
We traced the missing van

517
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,260
to Zhou Daming's location.

518
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,780
Then Zhou Daming

519
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,340
while robbing the tomb,

520
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,540
was accidentally killed in an explosion.

521
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,240
No evidence left behind.

522
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,940
And then,

523
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,300
at Zhou Daming's chicken farm,

524
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,180
we found a series of items,

525
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,100
like bloodstains,

526
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,180
a chainsaw,

527
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,620
a jade cicada,

528
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,260
and the DNA of the deceased.

529
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,740
I just got a call from the tech team.

530
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,540
They said no fingerprints

531
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,060
were left on the chainsaw.

532
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,820
Why would a person

533
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,100
clean his fingerprints

534
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,500
so thoroughly

535
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,420
in his own home?

536
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,700
No, I want to say

537
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,300
these clues showed up

538
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,860
way too smoothly.

539
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,380
I find it pretty strange too.

540
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,020
Thanks for pointing this out.

541
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,020
This is still pretty useful.

542
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,540
Where are you planning to go next?

543
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,260
I'm going to the chicken farm again.

544
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,780
I'll go with you.

545
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,700
Who's there?

546
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,380
The police.

547
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,220
It's me.

548
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,140
Lin Guoqiang.

549
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:14,900
Lin?

550
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,040
What are you doing here?

551
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,660
Why are you two together?

552
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,380
After I came back,

553
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,950
something kept bugging me.

554
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,360
Everything went too smoothly.

555
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:27,770
So I decided to come back and check.

556
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,700
I consulted Ms. Chen.

557
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,020
I wanted to come back too.

558
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,700
I also felt something was off.

559
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,020
What do you think is wrong?

560
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,020
The personality.

561
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,540
Personality?

562
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,580
I asked the villagers.

563
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,940
Zhou Daming

564
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,420
has a bad temper and likes drinking.

565
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,460
He often gets into fights.

566
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,580
And he's fond of gambling.

567
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,420
You think this matter

568
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,900
was done by someone meticulous,

569
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,020
not someone rough like him.

570
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,580
But,

571
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,300
didn't his wife run off with someone else

572
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,580
and take all his money with her?

573
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,900
Hating his ex-wife

574
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,700
doesn't mean he'd kill someone.

575
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,540
Let me show you something.

576
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,180
I found it at Zhou Daming's house.

577
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:10,780
P2P

578
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,020
Loan Contract.

579
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,020
I had Xiaoxing verify it.

580
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,460
Zhou Daming

581
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,670
lost a lot of money

582
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:19,860
in this P2P lending platforms.

583
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,620
He's only been out of prison for a few years.

584
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,820
People like him,

585
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,940
who personally dig up tombs,

586
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,140
probably don't make much money.

587
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:32,180
Exactly.

588
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,210
Around a million in total.

589
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:34,100
He threw it all in.

590
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:36,880
This doesn't seem like

591
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,610
something the suspect in this case would do.

592
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,900
Great minds think alike.

593
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,060
You two seem to...

594
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,260
Ms. Chen believes

595
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,780
Zhou Daming lacks

596
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,900
the cultural knowledge for this crime.

597
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,700
Makes sense.

598
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,020
Alright,

599
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:58,940
let's take a look.

600
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,620
What's going on here?

601
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,460
We're observing the blood spatter pattern.

602
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,220
Check this out here.

603
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:29,500
These are clearly blood drip marks.

604
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,100
But according to the test report,

605
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,340
the blood should've fallen as ice shards,

606
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,620
hitting the ground in that form,

607
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,940
then leaving traces as it melted.

608
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,200
But this clearly isn't the case.

609
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:38,820
See that?

610
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,260
Why is it so dense and abundant?

611
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,460
It's clearly splattered intentionally.

612
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,660
Why would the murderer do that?

613
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,180
Let's go back and analyze this carefully.

614
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,700
I'll also look into it thoroughly.

615
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,580
Take another look here.

616
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,020
What's wrong?

617
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:04,940
I don't get it.

618
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,420
It's inconsistent.

619
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,380
None of it matches.

620
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,740
Lin,

621
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,220
where's Captain Xu?

622
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,380
He's handling another task.

623
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,460
Let's begin.

624
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,600
Alright, got it.

625
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,100
Take a look at this saw.

626
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,660
Is it the same model?

627
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,100
Yes, it matches the one at the scene.

628
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,780
Did you trace it to a buyer?

629
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,140
The sales are too large

630
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,060
to trace the buyer.

631
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,220
This pig wasn't bled and frozen

632
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,580
as you asked.

633
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,460
Cut in half after coagulation.

634
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,500
Alright, that's enough.

635
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,420
Guo.

636
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,020
(Shuoyang Public Security Bureau)

637
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:30,940
Look here.

638
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,580
Photos from the incident site

639
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,380
show bloodstains everywhere on the wall

640
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,020
in a splatter pattern.

641
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,070
But when we recreated the scene,

642
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:39,420
the walls didn't have that much.

643
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,580
(Shuoyang Public Security Bureau)

644
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,860
The blood on the table and floor

645
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,020
after thawing

646
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,900
doesn't match the blood patterns

647
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,100
at the incident site, right?

648
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,580
Correct.

649
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,780
And based on the chainsaw's rotation,

650
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,140
blood typically sprays and gathers,

651
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,500
forming a pool.

652
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,080
But there's no such pool at the scene.

653
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,460
The last one is the most obvious.

654
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,160
The body blocked the center of the table,

655
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,060
leaving very little blood there.

656
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,030
However, the table at the incident site

657
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:16,300
is covered with blood stains.

658
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,620
Why is it so dense and abundant?

659
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,170
It's clearly splattered intentionally.

660
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,780
So, was the scene fabricated?

661
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,500
We can make such a judgment.

662
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:47,180
(Shuoyang Public Security Bureau)

663
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,380
That's all human blood.

664
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,560
And in such large quantities.

665
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:55,940
Mr. Lin...

666
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:57,860
What did those girls

667
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,460
go through before they died?

668
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,700
Zhou Daming

669
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,420
is probably just a scapegoat.

670
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,160
Laosan definitely knows something.

671
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,660
He's scared and dare not talk.

672
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,620
Interrogate him again.

673
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,300
- Alright.
- Got it.

674
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,220
Also,

675
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,500
submit today's report

676
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,580
to Captain Xu immediately.

677
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,420
