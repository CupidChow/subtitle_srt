00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Chapter 7

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
What are you saying, Nii-sama?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Shiori?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What do you mean you're going to marry her?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I will never forgive you!

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Sister Nanaka.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yes?

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Sister Chisa is not the type of person who puts books on the floor, right?

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
That's right, but...

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Nii-sama and the others are still wearing their clothes,

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and it's unnatural for them to sleep without being aware of Sister Nanaka's wedding.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
In other words, they think that something happened between them is a misunderstanding.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
If you put it that way...

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Right?

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Y-Yeah...

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That's exactly right, but...

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
How do you know that much?

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's as if you've seen a whole bunch of them.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's just a guess.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Chapter 8

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Hey Endless!

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Hey Endless!

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The moon is sleeping, and there's no variation at all

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Hey Endless!

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Sunday is a big day, and the sun is shining on the smartphone

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Hey Endless!

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Lately, my body's been shaking

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm tired of standing on my knees, and my family's been lonely, but I'm still crying

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The shine of that day is once again

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Let's go!

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The blue sea is so refreshing

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's still the season of the season

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Let's get high!

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Let's become a star!

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We're still looking at the world, and we're still looking for a dive

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Youth is

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
A battle to keep on fighting

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Youth is

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
A battle that won't be forgotten even if we're a few years old

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Youth is

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
A battle to keep on fighting

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Youth is forever

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Wow, you're Iori's little sister.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm Kitahara Shiori.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
My big brother always takes care of me.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
No, me too.

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Nice to meet you.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You're so polite.

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You're a good girl.

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So what are you here for?

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
To see how my big brother's doing.

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I wrote my report in a letter the other day.

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yes, I'm sure you're sending me a link every day.

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So I came here to make sure it was all a lie.

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You know that, too.

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I hate being insincere.

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I understand what you're saying, but...

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I just married my little sister.

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What do you mean you married?

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
There are various reasons.

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So you're worried about Iori's life?

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yes.

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And I wanted to say hello.

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Haruru.

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You're doing well.

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Is she really your little sister?

67
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You're so cool.

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It looks like you when you line up like this.

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
That's right.

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You have the same number of eyes.

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You have two fingers.

72
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Isn't there another one?

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes, yes.

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
My big brother too.

75
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Food?

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
No, my big brother forgot it at home.

77
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's important, isn't it?

78
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Stop it!

79
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm glad you're happy to be here.

80
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Where did you get this?

81
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I happened to open the locked desk the other day.

82
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
That's 100% love, too.

83
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Don't tell me you're Nakami.

84
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I saw it, but I don't know much about it.

85
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I read it with my family.

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The song I sang to my father.

87
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Why are you doing this to me?

88
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
By the way, how are you?

89
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
My father and mother are fine.

90
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
They wanted me to come and play.

91
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
If you don't mind, I'll take you to the inn.

92
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
That's great.

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'd love to go.

94
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So you're going to the inn one day?

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
No, my father said he didn't want to make me do it.

96
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Then it can't be helped.

97
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's a reasonable decision.

98
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I don't want to go after you.

99
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Really?

100
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I don't want to be a fool.

101
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You know me well.

102
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I won't stop talking about it because I'm stupid.

103
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I don't want to go after you.

104
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Don't say that.

105
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'll fix it as hard as I can.

106
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I told you it was wrong.

107
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Anyway, I'm going to the station.

108
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Aren't you going to stay?

109
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You came all the way here.

110
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm taking the exam this year.

111
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's not that hard.

112
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I have time.

113
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You're too naive.

114
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You study every day.

115
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You're so weak.

116
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's not normal to be so persuasive.

117
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm going home.

118
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Brother.

119
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Did you come because you were bothered?

120
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Shiori.

121
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's so annoying that I'm dying.

122
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I didn't go.

123
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Don't you have any kindness?

124
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Is that so?

125
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Iori.

126
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What are you talking about?

127
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I don't have a partner.

128
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Iori is also in trouble.

129
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Can you understand?

130
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I understand.

131
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
What is the average of a girl in junior high school who is younger than her sister?

132
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Iori's death.

133
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Hurry up.

134
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Before he comes.

135
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Good day, Kitahara.

136
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Is that your sister?

137
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
No.

138
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm Shiori, your sister.

139
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You're going to investigate my family.

140
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I see.

141
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm scared.

142
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm afraid I'll lose my head.

143
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm scared.

144
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm scared.

145
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Shut up.

146
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm the devil who takes over all the world.

147
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
But I'm not a demon.

148
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What?

149
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'll help you if you drink.

150
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What is it?

151
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
She called me Kohei Onii-chan.

152
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You're really creepy.

153
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Then die.

154
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Wait.

155
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Who said no?

156
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Shiori, do as you say.

157
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What?

158
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Please.

159
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm dying because of your words.

160
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
What?

161
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Well.

162
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm embarrassed.

163
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm embarrassed, Kitahara.

164
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm not going to abandon my brother.

165
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So, I'll ask Kohei Onii-chan.

166
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Kitahara.

167
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What?

168
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm counting on you.

169
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What money?

170
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I bought it from Larako-tan.

171
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I didn't hear about the money.

172
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Larako-tan?

173
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's a anime that Kohei likes.

174
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Oh, you mean the magical girl Larako?

175
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Do you know her?

176
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yes, just a little.

177
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I like the magical girl Larako.

178
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Kitahara.

179
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What?

180
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's really expensive.

181
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So what money?

182
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's dangerous to be here.

183
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I see.

184
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Then I'll try not to leave you.

185
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
That's dangerous.

186
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Anyway, go home.

187
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
No.

188
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Go home.

189
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
No.

190
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Go home.

191
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Don't argue.

192
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I told you to play games.

193
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I understand.

194
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Let's go to the team.

195
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
We are the judges.

196
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
There are so many people.

197
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Please cooperate with me.

198
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
No.

199
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I see.

200
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Then I'll blow your bad reputation into the air.

201
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
This is disgusting.

202
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I can't choose either.

203
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
She chose death herself.

204
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
She's a warrior.

205
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But Iori is blowing bad reputation into the air.

206
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Actually, he's a bug.

207
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Is he a demon?

208
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Well, the game is...

209
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's a game of half-past-past-past.

210
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's a nostalgic game.

211
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Who is this?

212
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's me.

213
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Let's make a place.

214
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm not a child to play like this.

215
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,920
Iori's

216
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,920
Brother.

217
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,920
This is my home.

218
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,920
It's a half-past-past-past.

219
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,920
What?

220
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,920
Iori?

221
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,920
She said she suddenly felt sleepy.

222
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,920
She must have lost her strength when she saw her sister's face.

223
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,920
Let's go.

224
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,920
I'll show you around.

225
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,920
Yes.

226
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,920
I'll help you.

227
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,920
But you know...

228
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,920
What?

229
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,920
I think you and Nanaka have the same hobby.

230
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,920
Really?

231
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,920
Nanaka loves you, too.

232
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,920
At first glance, I think I like you, but...

233
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,920
I feel something different.

234
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,920
I will never forgive you for running away from home.

235
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,920
Damn you.

236
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,920
I'm Shiori Kitahara.

237
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,920
I'm an AB type in the third grade of junior high school.

238
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,920
My parents are looking for an old hotel.

239
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,920
I want to confess one thing here.

240
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,920
Actually, I don't like my brother or anything.

241
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,920
Brother, it's morning.

242
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,920
Please wake up.

243
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,920
The reason why I'm acting like a housewife is...

244
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,920
...to make my brother pass the hotel to me.

245
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,920
I'll even play the bra-con for that.

246
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,920
Good morning.

247
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,920
Good morning.

248
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,920
You're early this morning.

249
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,920
Shiori woke me up.

250
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,920
What are you saying, brother?

251
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,920
The hotel work is even earlier than that.

252
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,920
I don't do the hotel work.

253
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,920
Then you can get a job properly.

254
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,920
I believe that my brother will come back.

255
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,920
You're great, Iori.

256
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,920
You should wear clothes.

257
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,920
I should wear clothes once every two days.

258
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,920
Wait for me.

259
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,920
I'll make dinner right away.

260
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,920
Sister Nanaka, can I help you?

261
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,920
Then let's make it together.

262
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,920
Now, the operation begins.

263
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,920
Let's eat.

264
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,920
Shiori made most of it.

265
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,920
I hope it goes well with your mouth.

266
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,920
It's delicious.

267
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,920
Shiori is good at cooking.

268
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,920
I'm not that good.

269
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,920
The miso I brought from home,

270
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,920
the sweet flavored egg,

271
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,920
and the pickles I made are all my favorite.

272
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,920
Brother, you're home-cooked.

273
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,920
I'm proud of you.

274
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,920
Brother, you should buy it from home-cooked.

275
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,920
If it's so delicious, my parents will miss it.

276
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,920
It's the taste of my mother.

277
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,920
What kind of taste is it?

278
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,920
It's a terrible memory.

279
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,920
What should I do with this idiot?

280
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,920
Then I'll play a bad bra-con this time.

281
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,920
I'll make him eat and make him suffer.

282
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,920
Oh, no.

283
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,920
Are you okay, brother?

284
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,920
I should change my clothes.

285
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,920
Do you want to take a bath?

286
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,920
I didn't take a bath yesterday.

287
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,920
Then let's do that.

288
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,920
I'll play with you and wash my back.

289
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,920
That's good.

290
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,920
That's good.

291
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,920
Are you going to play?

292
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,920
You're going to play, right?

293
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,920
At least one person is playing.

294
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,920
You don't care.

295
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,920
I'm going to play with Tsutomu after a long time.

296
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,920
Don't play because it's narrow.

297
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,920
I want you to play with those two.

298
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,920
I'll tell you one thing.

299
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,920
Yes.

300
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,920
Don't provoke Nanaka.

301
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,920
I don't understand.

302
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,920
Then I'll give you a bath.

303
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,920
Are you really going to play?

304
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,920
Yes, if you like it.

305
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,920
I won't forgive you.

306
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,920
Where did you come from?

307
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,920
That was dangerous.

308
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,920
You're okay now.

309
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,920
Yes.

310
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,920
You have to take care of yourself more.

311
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,920
I'm sure it's Imamura.

312
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,920
That's not it.

313
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,920
I'm sorry.

314
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,920
I mispronounced your name.

315
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,920
No, it's just that the way you call me is different.

316
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,920
You got it.

317
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,920
The right way to call me.

318
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,920
Imamura, the main job of the bug.

319
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,920
What are you doing?

320
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,920
Let's get ready.

321
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,920
Is there something today?

322
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,920
Yes.

323
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,920
Iori's license course continues.

324
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,920
What?

325
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,920
You're really going to go into the sea.

326
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,920
It's a diving circle.

327
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,920
It's just a drinking group that's completely alienated.

328
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,920
That's not true.

329
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,920
Iori, you have to answer with a louder voice.

330
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,920
By the way, can you swim?

331
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,920
I can't swim with a wave of people.

332
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,920
Let go of me.

333
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,920
I don't think they're really brothers.

334
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,920
What are you talking about?

335
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,920
Brother is my dear brother.

336
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,920
Then answer the question about Iori.

337
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,920
That's just what I want to know.

338
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,920
The first question.

339
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,920
What is her favorite food?

340
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,920
Isn't it Japanese sweets?

341
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,920
The second question.

342
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,920
What is her weakness?

343
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,920
The whole machine.

344
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,920
The third question.

345
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,920
What is her favorite clothes?

346
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,920
It's a kimono.

347
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,920
Are you right?

348
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,920
Brother is right.

349
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,920
What? I'm not right.

350
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,920
My favorite food is donuts, and I'm good at machines.

351
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,920
I'm just wearing a kimono because my parents are happy.

352
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,920
I'm impressed by your understanding.

353
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,920
That's good.

354
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,920
By the way, Iori, if you don't have a schedule, how about we go together?

355
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,920
Diving together?

356
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,920
It's a good idea. It's a lot of fun and it feels good.

357
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:05,920
Diving is more than making a place for my brother.

358
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,920
Excuse me. I won't do it.

359
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,920
I don't even have a swimsuit ready.

360
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,920
If you don't mind, I'll do it.

361
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,920
Me too.

362
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,920
I'm grateful for your feelings.

363
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,920
I see.

364
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,920
The size doesn't fit.

365
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,920
What is he doing?

366
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,920
Iori, what are you doing?

367
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,920
Was it bad?

368
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,920
No, I have to take the initiative of being a brother.

369
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,920
I'll kill you.

370
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,920
Oh, my eyes.

371
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,920
But Iori's swimsuit is a little too big for you.

372
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,920
Really?

373
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,920
I don't care about Nanaka.

374
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,920
It might fit my size.

375
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,920
It's okay. It's just the beginning.

376
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,920
Please don't get angry.

377
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,920
Iori is watching your brother from here.

378
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,920
I see. If Iori says so, it's impossible.

379
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,920
Wait.

380
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,920
It's a present.

381
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,920
A wild policeman.

382
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,920
Don't give me a kiss.

383
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,920
Don't worry. You're just misunderstanding.

384
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,920
It's a non-use item.

385
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,920
I'm afraid of using it. I can't stop shaking.

386
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,920
Don't worry.

387
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,920
I just need to see my brother.

388
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,140
Iori's

389
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,920
Do you hate the sea?

390
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,920
I don't really go in there, but I think it's an attractive and wonderful place.

391
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,920
That's a smart answer.

392
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,920
No, it's not.

393
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,920
I want you to try diving in there.

394
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,920
What do you mean?

395
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,920
It's valuable for smart kids.

396
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,920
It's a time to be able to empty your head in the wild.

397
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,920
If they look like they're having fun, I hope they try it.

398
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,920
Diving...

399
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,920
I think it's more important to get my brother back.

400
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,920
In the first place, it looks like it's going to be fun.

401
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,920
I don't know.

402
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,920
Iori wants to try it, too.

403
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,920
Then let's dive together.

404
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,920
No, Iori will go with my brother.

405
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,920
I'm testing it.

406
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,920
I'll make sure Iori is close.

407
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,920
I understand.

408
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,920
It's not because they looked like they were having fun.

409
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,920
It's not like that.

410
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,920
I'll adjust the force, so don't worry.

411
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,920
Yes.

412
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,920
Iori's brother is going to be back.

413
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,920
I'm going to be back.

414
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:17,920
Oh, this is the scenery in the sea?

415
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:22,920
It wasn't that clean because of the rain the other day.

416
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,920
I'm sorry.

417
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,920
I'm sorry.

418
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,920
I'm sorry.

419
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:34,920
But I can't hear you even though you're with someone.

420
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,920
I don't have to be careful with my words.

421
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:42,920
This mysterious time may be precious.

422
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,920
Let's celebrate Iori's license and welcome to Shiori!

423
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,920
Cheers!

424
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,920
Now we have an open water diver.

425
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,920
We can relax without the wind.

426
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,920
We failed because of the gravity.

427
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,920
How was it, Shiori?

428
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,920
It was like swimming in miso soup.

429
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:11,920
There was a seaweeds, and it was more beautiful after the rain.

430
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,920
But it was a very fresh experience.

431
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,920
That's good.

432
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:29,520
That oolong tea is a

433
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,920
Iori's brother.

434
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,920
Oh, my brother.

435
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,920
What are you doing?

436
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:49,920
I was too messy when I came to change clothes, so I cleaned it up.

437
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,920
Oh, my. Your butt is finally broken.

438
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,920
What are you doing?

439
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,920
I was looking for you.

440
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,920
I was caught.

441
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,920
I didn't know you noticed.

442
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:05,920
You really wanted to go somewhere else today, didn't you?

443
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,920
What?

444
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,920
No, it's not like that.

445
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,920
That's good.

446
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,920
This old man is my brother.

447
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,920
I'm too worried about my brother.

448
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,920
I see.

449
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,920
Shiori is not a child anymore.

450
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,920
You're not good at saying that.

451
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,920
It's not like that.

452
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,920
But you don't seem to be saying that you don't want to go to the inn.

453
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,920
What?

454
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,920
What's wrong?

455
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,920
I don't want to go to the inn right now.

456
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:44,920
I don't know how stupid you think I am, but I know that much.

457
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:51,920
I don't know your favorite food or clothes, but I'm your brother.

458
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,920
What?

459
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,920
I know where Shiori is.

460
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,920
That's easy.

461
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,920
I'm your brother.

462
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,920
Brother?

463
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,920
Then, please follow me to the inn.

464
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,920
I'm sorry, Komuru.

465
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,920
It's so noisy.

466
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,920
Well, Shiori, say hello to everyone.

467
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,920
See you.

468
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,920
I hope you come when it's clear.

469
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,920
What's wrong?

470
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,920
Shiori will go home quietly, so I'll go with you.

471
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,920
You're going to lock me up at home.

472
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,920
I'll go home and show my face, so go home today.

473
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,920
You look just like Nanaka.

474
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,920
What?

475
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,920
I came to see my brother who left the house alone.

476
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,920
I imitated what he was doing and became interested in the environment.

477
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,920
That's a complete bra-con.

478
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,920
I'm Kitahara Shiori.

479
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:13,920
I don't like my brother or anything, but I don't hate him.

480
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,920
I want to talk to you.

481
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,920
I want to know everything about you.

482
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,920
It's boring to end at 1 o'clock.

483
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,920
Stand by until 2, 3, 4 o'clock.

484
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,920
Let's go deeper into the deep night.

485
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,920
Your history, your scenery, your page.

486
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,920
Hey, get closer.

487
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,920
You're my future.

488
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,920
This is the perfect place to forget tomorrow.

489
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,920
Hey, get closer.

490
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,920
Slip too much, slip too much.

491
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,920
I'm a clumsy person.

492
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,920
Let's take care of it now.

493
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:55,920
Live your life with all your might so you don't regret it.

494
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,920
I can do it.

495
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,920
I'm not going to be a lie.

496
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,920
I'll fly.

497
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,920
I'll fly.

498
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,920
First of all, please take off your clothes.

499
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:16,940
I'm going to be a

500
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:20,940
magical imagination that crosses the wall.

501
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,940
Once you get used to it, you won't feel anything.

502
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,940
Just one night, I'll drink that mysterious liquor.

503
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,940
I'm going to be a

504
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,940
Try not.

505
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,940
Hey, hey.

506
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:35,940
Before I knew it, my heart was more naked.

507
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,940
I'm going to catch up.

508
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,940
I'm going to catch up.

509
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,940
I'm going to catch up.

510
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,940
I'm going to catch up.

511
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,940
I'm going to catch up.

512
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,940
I'm going to catch up.

513
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,940
I'm going to catch up.
