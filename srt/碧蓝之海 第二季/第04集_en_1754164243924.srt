00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
A&OS

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
A&OS

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
A&OS

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
No monthly salary, no money, no variation

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
A&OS

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I put my afternoon on my smartphone to surf

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
A&OS

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Recently, my body is tired

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm tired of working out, but I'm still crying

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The shine of that day, once again

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Let's go, the blue sea, the red waves

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's always a season of the moment

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Get high, keep on, it's easy to become an adult

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm still looking for a world to dive in

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Youth is

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
A path to pursue your dreams

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Youth is

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
A path that never stops

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Youth is

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
A path to continue your journey

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Youth Forever

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I think it's unfair.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Um, what are you talking about?

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
About our drinks.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Every time, every time, all the guys are taking off their clothes.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yeah, I agree.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Azusa is also mixed with them.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So today, we're going to have a big party with just girls!

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's a girls' party.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Are you going to do it in my room?

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
That's more fun.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
What about Nanaka's room?

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's definitely not allowed.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Cheers!

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
This is a normal drinking party.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That's good.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You don't have enough, do you?

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
No, I don't.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm a girl too.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Speaking of which,

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What is it?

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Chi-chan's room doesn't have any decorations, right?

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I thought so too.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This is enough.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Oh, but there are cosmetics.

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That's what you're doing.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Because if you leave Chisa alone, she won't do anything.

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That's true.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Well, I'd like some cosmetics.

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Is there anything else?

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
A girls' party in Chi-chan's room?

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Can you take this with you?

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Chi-chan, this is from the old man.

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
He even gave me this.

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Listen to me!

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
That's not mine because you bought it.

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I see.

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You really know.

59
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I know.

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That's yours, right?

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm sure you're mistaken.

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What happened?

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I felt a little responsible.

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Responsible?

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
For not keeping my promise.

66
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Thank you, Chi-chan!

67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'll buy you a more attractive underwear next time!

68
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I don't know, but that's not good.

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Welcome back.

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Did you get the wrong room?

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I think so.

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I heard Chi-chan's voice.

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But I don't think it's right to say that this is Nanaka's room.

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
God is unfair in many ways!

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Why are we so small?

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Really?

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I wonder why.

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Are you doing something special?

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
With exercise or food?

80
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
If you say so.

81
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I think it's a bad thing.

82
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Really?

83
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You're a woman, right?

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
If you want to be beautiful, you need to be more attractive.

85
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I think it's a little bit reasonable.

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What?

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Then...

88
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Nanaka has a lot of family.

89
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
In short, you need to be attractive.

90
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
That's it.

91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yori, take this.

92
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Hey, you're going to take this too?

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Sashimi?

94
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Thank you, Yori.

95
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Sorry, I can't let go of your hand.

96
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Come on!

97
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'll tell you, but that was a bad joke between women.

98
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
What?

99
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You may not have realized it, but it was a very dangerous situation.

100
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What are you talking about?

101
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Anyway, stop talking about that!

102
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I don't understand.

103
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Chii-chan, is this a movie?

104
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's a diving documentary.

105
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You like Chisa, don't you?

106
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I borrowed it from Yori and came back yesterday.

107
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I want to see it too.

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Hey, Yori.

109
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Senpai, you're here.

110
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
This isn't an AV.

111
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Really?

112
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm sorry, I think I put it in the wrong place.

113
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Come on, man.

114
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
By the way, what was in it?

115
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's a diving movie.

116
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Is it a hand signal to go first?

117
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
No, it's just a warning.

118
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's a girls' party, so it's a waste to watch a movie.

119
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Stop using the wrong word!

120
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I can watch the rest of it.

121
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
That's a little...

122
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Anyway, girls' parties are a love trap!

123
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Oh!

124
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Then, let's talk about love.

125
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Azusa, please.

126
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Oh, me?

127
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You have a lot of experience.

128
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Hmm, you suddenly asked me.

129
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Something happened recently.

130
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Recently?

131
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I heard it was recently.

132
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Did you invite Yori to the edge?

133
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What?

134
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So what happened?

135
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
She refused.

136
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Don't tell me Azusa is talking about Yori.

137
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I like you.

138
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What about that Aina?

139
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Azusa, let's drink.

140
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's a girls' party.

141
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You ran away.

142
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Cheers!

143
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Cheers!

144
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Is Nanaka weak in alcohol?

145
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I don't think she's that strong.

146
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Oh, right.

147
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Here.

148
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
My entrance ticket to the school festival.

149
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Oh, it's a ticket.

150
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I hope no strange people can enter.

151
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's annoying to be a man.

152
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
This year, a famous voice actor will come.

153
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I see.

154
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It seems that Yori and Kohei want it.

155
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
That's right.

156
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
That's right.

157
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So I won't let them know.

158
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Kebako, if you don't want to be hurt by the girls' party anymore,

159
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
give us the ticket.

160
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I don't want it.

161
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Why?

162
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I don't know why.

163
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Anyway, I can't.

164
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Aki?

165
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I gave you everything.

166
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I gave it to Chisa, too.

167
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
What?

168
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Really?

169
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Kohei, hold the exit.

170
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Okay.

171
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Hey, Chisa.

172
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
There was a loan between you and me.

173
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
There is, but...

174
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Don't forget that loan.

175
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Will you forgive me?

176
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'll keep it as a loan.

177
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Do you have another loan?

178
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You're the one who's borrowing.

179
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
What are you going to do?

180
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Reject.

181
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Then I'll be your bodyguard.

182
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'll be your luggage.

183
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I don't need it.

184
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What are you doing?

185
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's a school festival.

186
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I hope no strange men can enter.

187
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
They're really being followed now.

188
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
By the way, Yori is Chisa's boyfriend.

189
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Go!

190
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Kebako, that's...

191
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What's wrong?

192
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm so glad.

193
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm totally drunk.

194
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Nanaka, are you okay?

195
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm fine.

196
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Does she always look like this?

197
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Yes.

198
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
When she gets drunk...

199
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Chisa!

200
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
She's got a habit of hugging me.

201
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I see.

202
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It's hot.

203
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'll take your place.

204
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Aina!

205
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'll take your place.

206
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Nanaka, you've grown up again.

207
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Just a little.

208
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm so tired.

209
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It's a school festival.

210
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Boys, get out of here.

211
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Kebako, you're so reckless.

212
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You're drunk, Nanaka.

213
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I can't believe she has a habit of hugging me.

214
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Thanks to her, I was able to ignore Kebako's appearance.

215
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But the problem now is...

216
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
A ticket to the Aoi Girls' School Festival.

217
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Good morning.

218
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Hey, wait a minute.

219
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'll be ready to have breakfast.

220
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
By the way, you're not very good at drinking.

221
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Him?

222
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yes.

223
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
He was hugging Chisa when he was drunk yesterday.

224
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
That's strange.

225
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Is it strange?

226
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
After all, she's my daughter.

227
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Good morning, Dad.

228
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Iori.

229
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Good morning.

230
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Good morning.

231
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Iori.

232
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yes.

233
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
About Chisa's boyfriend yesterday.

234
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Let me hear it in detail next time.

235
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
He's not a little drunk.

236
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Why are there so many people?

237
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You're so annoying.

238
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You're embarrassing me.

239
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Can you shut up when you hear the ticket to the Aoi Girls' School Festival?

240
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
The first class is the first class.

241
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
For the time being, I'm going to go home.

242
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Don't be ridiculous.

243
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Don't be ridiculous.

244
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm going to go home.

245
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm going to go home.

246
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm going to go home.

247
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm going to go home.

248
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Don't come out.

249
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You're not related.

250
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
The girls and the girls are gone.

251
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I think there are still many people left.

252
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Are there still so many people?

253
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
There are many.

254
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
There are only three people left.

255
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
In other words, there are only two people left except me.

256
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
How do you decide?

257
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Do you want to kill me without any regrets?

258
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I can't help it.

259
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Wait.

260
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
How about choosing Chisa?

261
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I see.

262
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's the same school as the other school.

263
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Chisa, is that okay?

264
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I live alone.

265
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Okay.

266
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Listen.

267
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
The appeal time is two minutes per person.

268
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Yes.

269
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I want to go home.

270
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'll go first.

271
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'll go first.

272
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I'll go first.

273
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
What do you want to do?

274
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I want to talk to you.

275
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Kotegawa, do you like sweets?

276
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Well, I don't know.

277
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
My friend is in Aoujo.

278
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
We're going to have a crepe shop.

279
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'll give you a lot of sweets.

280
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'll show you around.

281
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Then...

282
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I think I should get a ticket from my friend.

283
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm going.

284
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Is it bad?

285
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
No, it's the same.

286
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
What? Ticket?

287
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I can't get in touch with that girl.

288
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You're a bad person.

289
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
If you have a choice, you're the one.

290
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You don't have to choose this.

291
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'll go next.

292
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
What's with that confident face?

293
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You'll understand my passion.

294
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Is it a direct match?

295
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's a high-level exchange without a small thing.

296
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Kotegawa.

297
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
What?

298
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm going to Aoujo.

299
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm sure I can get a girlfriend.

300
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Is that so?

301
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
No, it's impossible.

302
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's impossible.

303
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
But if you say it's no good, I'll give up.

304
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You guys are on my side.

305
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Please be my girlfriend.

306
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I won't give it to you.

307
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Today is the day.

308
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's not a passion. It's a threat.

309
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I can't hide it from anyone.

310
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I have a boyfriend.

311
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I said stop.

312
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
My execution will begin soon.

313
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm next.

314
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
What's your plan?

315
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm clumsy and talkative.

316
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I don't talk much.

317
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
What will you do?

318
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'll talk to you with my back.

319
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What?

320
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
What's the path of a hard-boiled man?

321
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I can give you two more.

322
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm just a man.

323
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I can't see a man's face.

324
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm going to the sex life.

325
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I don't have money.

326
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I said it.

327
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'll give you my life.

328
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You're a bad man.

329
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm going to the sex life.

330
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'll show you a woman.

331
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Kotagawa, you're beautiful today.

332
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm so desperate.

333
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I don't want to see that woman next to you.

334
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You're a beautiful woman.

335
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'll be a prince.

336
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm sorry.

337
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Please continue.

338
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm fine.

339
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You're the best.

340
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You're a good man.

341
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
What do you want me to be?

342
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Shut up.

343
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
If you don't do what you said.

344
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You're a bad man.

345
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You're a bad man.

346
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You're not a good man.

347
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You're just a bad man.

348
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I don't understand.

349
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm sorry.

350
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm sorry.

351
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Kotagawa.

352
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm sorry.

353
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You're a man who doesn't choose the right way.

354
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You're a man.

355
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Why are you so desperate?

356
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
There are many reasons.

357
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
That's why.

358
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm just Tsutomu's boyfriend.

359
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
That's what happened.

360
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I was wondering what to do if you were really dating.

361
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I don't want to hear what you were doing.

362
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
If that's the case.

363
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Yes?

364
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Tsutomu is not the only one who is hit by a girl.

365
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Right?

366
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Damn it.

367
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm dying.

368
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I can't fail.

369
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It's Kitahara's turn.

370
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Go and have a good time.

371
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
What is he doing?

372
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Chisa.

373
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Choose me.

374
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
This is for you.

375
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Why is it for me?

376
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Think about it.

377
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You don't want to kill and kill people from the same house, do you?

378
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Wait, what does that mean?

379
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Don't tell me you're going to kill me.

380
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
That's a misunderstanding.

381
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'm the one who died.

382
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
The culprit is Nanaka.

383
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Why are you involved?

384
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,000
That's because Nanaka is very quiet and loves you.

385
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Really?

386
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm sorry my sister is so quiet.

387
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I can't explain why.

388
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Please choose me.

389
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
No.

390
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I understand.

391
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'll listen to you.

392
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Then give up after you're hit by a car five times.

393
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
There's no point in being hit five times.

394
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It's a misunderstanding.

395
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's time.

396
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It's been two minutes.

397
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Let me go.

398
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Damn it.

399
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I'm sorry.

400
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm the last one.

401
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You're still here.

402
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
He's not close to Kotegawa and has little contact with him.

403
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
He's a loner.

404
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
If you take me with you, I won't do anything.

405
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
What?

406
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
If you let me in, we'll split up right away.

407
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I won't do anything bad alone.

408
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I won't get in the way of Kotegawa.

409
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Damn it.

410
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
That's what it means.

411
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I don't want you to do anything.

412
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
What's important is...

413
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
what you don't do.

414
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
What do you think, Kotegawa?

415
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
If that's the case...

416
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm done for.

417
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
He's the best.

418
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I won't do anything.

419
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Can you give up so easily?

420
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
They're just women.

421
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
If it's impossible, just give up.

422
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
But I...

423
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'm going to tell you something.

424
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I'm going to...

425
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Damn it.

426
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I knew it.

427
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I can see what you're going to do.

428
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Sorry.

429
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I was too careless and pushed the handkerchief that soaked the medicine.

430
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
That can't be helped.

431
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
These guys...

432
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
How desperate are they?

433
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Now I understand.

434
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
If we're going to kill them all,

435
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
we should have done this from the beginning.

436
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
That's right.

437
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I'm going to risk my life for this fight.

438
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Then I'll be...

439
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It's no use trying to run away.

440
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
The ending is coming soon.

441
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Come on.

442
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Die, you bastard!

443
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Stop it!

444
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I don't think this is right.

445
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
How can good friends fight over something like this?

446
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Friends should be equal.

447
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It's weird to think that only a few people are special.

448
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I believe that everyone here is not a person who fights with friends.

449
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Kotegawa...

450
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Friends are equal in the fight?

451
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
That's right.

452
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I'm sorry, Mr. Uchi.

453
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm sorry.

454
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm glad you understand.

455
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
So I'll do this alone.

456
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Yeah, you guys...

457
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm going to stop being friends with you!

458
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
This is how we fight!

459
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
What?

460
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
No, I mean...

461
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I want you to take care of your friends, not me.

462
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I can't do this anymore.

463
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Oops.

464
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
What's wrong, Mitai?

465
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
No, it's about the childhood friend of Aoi.

466
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'll give you that much, but it's really just this time.

467
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
If you betray me next time, I'll pay you back.

468
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I heard you can give me a ticket.

469
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Then you four can afford to enter with the ticket.

470
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
That's right.

471
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
That means...

472
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I see.

473
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So the girls are all going to go together.

474
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
That's right.

475
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Why do you look so sad, Achi?

476
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Let's dive deeper into your history, your scenery.

477
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Your page is flying.

478
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Hey, come closer.

479
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
You're my future, my work.

480
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
This ruckus I'll forget tomorrow.

481
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It's just not finished.

482
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Hey, slide more.

483
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Sliding too much, sliding too much, I'm a clumsy person.

484
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Let's take care of it now, play.

485
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Don't regret it.

486
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Live now with all your might.

487
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I can do it, right?

488
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Go beyond the limit.

489
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Not all night, until noon.

490
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Fly.

491
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Fly.

492
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
First, please take off your clothes.

493
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
The meeting of the two sides.

494
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
The meeting of the two sides of life and death.

495
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I want to meet you and throw you out of the beauty.

496
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I want to decorate my exposed feelings.

497
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
You and I.

498
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
What? What?

499
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
The magical magic that pierces the wall.

500
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
If you get used to it, you won't feel anything.

501
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Just one night, that mysterious drink.

502
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I'll continue to drink as it is.

503
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Try now.

504
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Hey, hey.

505
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Before I knew it, my heart is chasing after the naked.

506
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Thank you for watching.
