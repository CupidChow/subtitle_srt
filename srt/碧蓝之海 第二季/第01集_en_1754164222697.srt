1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Sea of the Sea

2
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,500
The sea is so nice, isn't it?

3
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,000
Iori-kun!

4
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,500
A letter for you.

5
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,000
From Shiori-chan.

6
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,000
Shiori?

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The Sea of the Sea

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Sea of the Sea

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The Sea of the Sea

10
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,500
Dear brother,

11
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
How are you doing in the middle of the sea?

12
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,000
The mountains are full of summer colors,

13
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,000
with the beautiful views of Sawagi and the whole of the land.

14
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,500
It's been three months since your brother went to school.

15
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,500
Have you been bothering your sister or your uncle?

16
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,500
Are you trying to calm him down?

17
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,500
I'm worried about you.

18
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,500
I'm worried about my father and mother.

19
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,500
I want you to be a priest, but if you can't,

20
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,500
please tell me in a short time.

21
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm looking forward to your reply.

22
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,500
I'm sorry.

23
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I made a doll with the leftover of the watermelons.

24
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,000
I'd be happy if you could decorate it thinking of it as a letter.

25
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Iori-kun.

26
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,000
Did you reply to Shiori-chan?

27
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,500
Nanaka-san.

28
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,500
Actually, I don't think I should reply to her this time.

29
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Oh, why?

30
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,500
She said that unreliable things are good evidence.

31
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,500
That's true, but...

32
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,000
Then, I'll write about your life.

33
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,500
About Nonoko-san?

34
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,500
Yeah.

35
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
This way, Chisato-chan and I got a letter.

36
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But, you want to know the current situation of your family, right?

37
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Is that so?

38
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,000
Report my situation.

39
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Please forgive me!

40
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,000
But Chisato-chan seems to have already started writing.

41
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,000
I've got an answer!

42
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,000
What?

43
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,500
I'll write my own letter!

44
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You write about yourself, right?

45
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:22,000
It's fine, but if you're going to write a lie, tell me.

46
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,000
Tch!

47
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,000
So, tell me when you're done. I'll check it.

48
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,000
Okay.

49
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,000
Damn it, I'm in trouble.

50
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,000
You're in the same school and in the same circle.

51
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,000
You know everything about my life.

52
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,500
I can't lie.

53
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,500
I have to write about myself and tell her.

54
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,500
Hi, Shiori.

55
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's almost summer.

56
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,500
Ioriori.

57
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The book.

58
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,500
There's nothing to write!

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'll write a letter.

60
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,500
No, it's fine.

61
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,500
I just couldn't think of a way to say hello.

62
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,500
Oh...

63
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,500
Then, write it with all your might.

64
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,500
Okay, I see.

65
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,500
All my might.

66
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,500
Concentration.

67
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Concentration.

68
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,500
One more chance!

69
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I think it's easier to write if you give her a reason.

70
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,500
Then, about the circle activities, school studies, and private life.

71
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,500
Okay, I'll report a lie.

72
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,500
Shiori.

73
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,500
Shiori.

74
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,500
I'm in a diving circle called Peekaboo.

75
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,500
Everyone here is very thoughtful.

76
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,500
You're lying!

77
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,500
They taught me how to express myself without a decoration.

78
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,500
My university studies are completely different from middle school and high school.

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,500
The test is difficult, but everyone is working hard and preparing for it.

80
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,500
So, canning?

81
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,500
So, how do you bring this?

82
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,500
Inside the pencil case.

83
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,000
The label of the drink.

84
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,500
Inside the towel.

85
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,500
I'll go inside the ring.

86
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,500
I'll never give up until the end and take the turn together!

87
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,500
Yeah!

88
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,500
About private life, I have nothing to write about.

89
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,500
I live a regular life every day.

90
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,500
I'm going to be late again today!

91
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,500
I can't make it!

92
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I don't wear unscrupulous clothes.

93
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,500
Please wear a bag sometimes!

94
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,500
I sometimes have an exciting day.

95
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,500
That's why it's different!

96
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,500
I don't understand!

97
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,500
I'm not saying that! I'm saying that!

98
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,500
I'll ask you in Urayama.

99
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,500
I'm not going to ask you!

100
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,500
I'm doing well, so don't worry.

101
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,500
Please tell my parents.

102
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,500
I see.

103
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,500
How is it, brother?

104
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,500
But it's nice to have a letter now.

105
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,500
Not an email.

106
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,500
No, it's not that.

107
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,500
That guy is a machine.

108
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Oh my.

109
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,500
He may not be able to use a computer or a smartphone.

110
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I see.

111
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,500
Everyone has their own problems.

112
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Well, that's why I let you fool me this time.

113
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,500
It's as far as the truth.

114
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You're not lying, are you?

115
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,500
But if you get used to it now, you'll be able to...

116
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
That's right.

117
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Now you can mix with me.

118
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,500
You're the worst.

119
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,500
Oh my.

120
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I need to keep an eye on my brother who lies.

121
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,000
Right?

122
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Hello!

123
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,500
What's up, you two?

124
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,500
Huh?

125
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,500
We have a meeting today.

126
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,500
Hey, hey.

127
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,500
That's for next week.

128
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Seriously?

129
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,000
Why isn't everyone here?

130
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,500
We said it at the last meeting.

131
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I totally forgot.

132
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,000
Where are Nanaka and Tenkyo?

133
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,000
They're on a business trip.

134
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,500
Well...

135
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Are you going to make it soon?

136
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,500
What are you talking about?

137
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Dinner.

138
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Hmm...

139
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,500
Thank you.

140
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,000
What's wrong, Kemako?

141
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Nothing.

142
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,000
Let me taste it.

143
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's a little spicy.

144
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,500
Really?

145
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,500
I'll help you.

146
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,500
I'll make the dessert.

147
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,500
Huh?

148
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,500
I don't need it.

149
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,500
It's okay.

150
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,500
What's going on?

151
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,500
Something happened?

152
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,500
Kemako kicked me out.

153
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,500
I see.

154
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So what do you think?

155
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,500
What do you mean?

156
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
What's going on?

157
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,500
I'm not sure if I'll get something decent.

158
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,500
It's a 6-4.

159
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,500
Thank you for the food.

160
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I guess I've calmed down with the fruit.

161
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,500
What were you going to make first?

162
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Pudding.

163
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,500
I'll teach you how to make it this time.

164
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,500
By the way...

165
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,500
Do you often go to the bathroom together?

166
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,500
Sometimes.

167
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Once a month.

168
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,500
Is that okay?

169
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
What do you mean?

170
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,500
What do you mean?

171
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Well...

172
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,500
I don't think I make mistakes.

173
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
You make mistakes?

174
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
What are you talking about?

175
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,500
I told you to be nice to me.

176
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,500
I told you to be nice to me.

177
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,500
You did.

178
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,500
And you're nice to me.

179
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,500
Aina!

180
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,500
What's going on?

181
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,500
I don't know.

182
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,500
You're a good friend.

183
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,500
But you're like a sister.

184
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,500
I see.

185
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,500
I see.

186
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,500
So you're determined to help me.

187
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,500
Wait!

188
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,500
What are you going to do to your sister?

189
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,500
Don't make me say it.

190
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,500
What are you going to do?

191
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,500
It's your way of thinking that's embarrassing.

192
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,500
But this is the second dimension.

193
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,500
What are you thinking?

194
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,500
I don't think there's anyone who would do that to my sister.

195
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,500
I see.

196
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,500
There's no way.

197
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,500
Why are you all staring at me?

198
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,500
People who don't have sisters say that.

199
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,500
But it's not a good thing.

200
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,500
Do you have a sister?

201
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,500
Well, yes.

202
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,500
I'm not sure.

203
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,500
What's your answer?

204
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,500
Choose your words.

205
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,500
I don't have one.

206
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,500
Look into my eyes and answer.

207
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,500
I'm a cute girl named Shiori.

208
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,500
I'm a human.

209
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,500
What's with the count?

210
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,500
How old are you?

211
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,500
I think I was in the third grade.

212
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,500
Stop it! That count is scary!

213
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,500
Are you close to Iori?

214
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,500
I don't think I'm a little older than you.

215
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,500
This is bad!

216
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,500
I'm going to be born again!

217
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,500
He sent me a letter the other day.

218
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,500
I see.

219
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,500
It's not an email. It's a letter.

220
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,500
Yeah.

221
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,500
He just couldn't use his phone.

222
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Really?

223
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,000
He's a genius.

224
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,500
He's just hiding it in front of you.

225
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,500
I got an answer from Shiori.

226
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,500
And I got this too.

227
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,500
It's handmade.

228
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It's cute!

229
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm going to send you this photo as a thank you.

230
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,500
That's not good.

231
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,000
Why?

232
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,000
If you find out about my life, you'll be sent to jail.

233
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,000
If you have a sense of self-awareness, do it again.

234
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,000
If you say you have to, I'll select a photo.

235
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,000
Okay.

236
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,000
No, big brother.

237
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,000
There's no other photo that I can send you.

238
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,500
It's because you always take it off.

239
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,500
The land is more exposed than the sea.

240
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's interesting to take a picture of the sunset.

241
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,500
Chisa! Chisa!

242
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,500
What?

243
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,500
This...

244
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,000
What's wrong with that photo?

245
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,000
It's nothing!

246
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,500
Don't be so mean!

247
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
My heart almost spilled.

248
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,500
My sister and Azusa are both big.

249
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,000
I see.

250
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,000
It's a photo of Nanaka and Azusa's treasure.

251
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,500
I can't show it to you!

252
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,500
I have to delete this data.

253
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,500
I won't tell you to show it to me.

254
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,500
What?

255
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,500
Is that so?

256
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,500
That's fine, but...

257
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I need to use the bathroom.

258
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,000
Okay.

259
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,500
Look!

260
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,500
You can't show it to me just because you want to see it.

261
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,500
I'm not interested in this place, Zoui.

262
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,500
I'll steal it from the moon!

263
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,000
See you later.

264
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,000
Okay.

265
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,000
Oh, right.

266
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,500
Be careful if you're alone.

267
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
I told you it's impossible.

268
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,500
Just in case.

269
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,500
Bye.

270
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
Then let's continue with the photo selection.

271
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
Now there's no one in the way.

272
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,000
What?

273
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,500
It's nothing.

274
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,500
Maybe it's just my imagination.

275
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,500
Aina is saying something weird.

276
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,500
I've deleted the person in the way.

277
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,500
Now...

278
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,500
I just want that photo!

279
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,500
Well then...

280
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,500
What's wrong?

281
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,500
Nothing.

282
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,000
Well...

283
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,500
Now...

284
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,500
What was that?

285
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,500
Did you try to do something?

286
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,500
No, nothing.

287
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,500
It's a very good thing, but...

288
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,500
No way.

289
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,500
Is that so?

290
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,500
After all, it's just a photo of diving.

291
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,500
It can't be helped.

292
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,500
I haven't worn any other clothes.

293
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,500
Well then, let's go.

294
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,500
What?

295
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,500
Go take a shower first.

296
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,500
The bathroom is closed.

297
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,500
Aren't you going to take a bath?

298
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,500
I will, but...

299
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,500
Iori...

300
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,500
I have a TV I want to watch, so I'll go in later.

301
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,500
Okay.

302
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Well then...

303
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,500
This is where the battle begins.

304
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,500
The battle begins.

305
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,500
Daki!

306
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,500
You pervert!

307
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,500
No! I just...

308
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,500
I just wanted the clothes you took off!

309
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,500
You're a more arrogant pervert!

310
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:15,500
I can't believe I was being careful.

311
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,500
What should I do?

312
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,500
Oh, I forgot to turn it off.

313
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,500
It's not good to use something that looks expensive.

314
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,500
And something that looks like shampoo...

315
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,500
Can you do it?

316
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,500
I can do it!

317
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,500
Iori!

318
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,500
Chisaa!

319
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,500
I just want to use your shampoo today!

320
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,500
I-It's fine, but...

321
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,500
Sorry about that, Chisaa.

322
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,500
Your head?

323
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,500
That's not what I meant.

324
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,500
I don't know why, but I'm a little worried.

325
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,500
If it's this...

326
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,500
I'm going to change my clothes!

327
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,500
I'll give up.

328
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,500
Oh, it's already this late.

329
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,500
Well then, I'll go back to my room.

330
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Me too.

331
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,500
Wait.

332
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,500
How did you get rid of the photos?

333
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,500
You can't even burn them.

334
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,500
You just have to wrap them up and throw them away.

335
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,500
There's still hope in the garbage bin!

336
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Iori's Room

337
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,500
What's going on?

338
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,000
Were you awake?

339
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,500
I was awake.

340
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
No, Chisaa!

341
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,500
I know you're not trying to do this, but...

342
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I know.

343
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,000
This is your purpose, right?

344
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,000
When did you notice?

345
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,000
Since the bath time.

346
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,500
It's weird that Iori doesn't want to see you.

347
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,000
You're so naive.

348
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,500
Now, if you know that much...

349
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,500
I'll destroy you!

350
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,500
I'll wake you up!

351
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,500
You're too naive!

352
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,500
Iori's Room

353
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,000
Wait, wait, wait!

354
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,000
I'm home!

355
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,500
Oh?

356
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,500
Chisaa, are you still sleeping?

357
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,000
Well...

358
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,500
What does this mean?

359
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,000
Oh...

360
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,000
Huh? Chisaa?

361
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,500
By the way, did you sneak in yesterday?

362
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,500
If someone saw you like this...

363
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,500
I might die today.

364
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,500
Iori-ken!

365
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,500
Calm down, Nanaka-san!

366
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,500
Nanaka-san...

367
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,500
I didn't do anything with Chisaa.

368
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,500
It was just a coincidence.

369
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,500
I swear to God that I didn't do anything wrong to Chisaa.

370
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,500
I'm scared!

371
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,500
I'm sorry!

372
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,500
It was just an accident!

373
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,500
It's okay, Iori-kun.

374
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,500
I know.

375
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
What?

376
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,500
Oh, my.

377
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,500
I was in a hurry.

378
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,500
I knew it.

379
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,500
It smells like the same shampoo as Chisaa.

380
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,000
Don't say anything.

381
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,000
I know everything.

382
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,500
Oh?

383
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,500
Iori and Onee-chan?

384
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Good morning, Chisaa!

385
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,000
Nice timing, Chisaa!

386
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,500
Please explain what happened yesterday to me!

387
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
What's wrong?

388
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,500
My life is at stake!

389
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Well, yesterday...

390
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,000
Iori sneaked into my room while I was asleep.

391
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,500
Oh, really?

392
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,000
No way!

393
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,000
That's not it, Nanaka-san!

394
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,000
I had a purpose for that!

395
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,500
A purpose?

396
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,500
That's a bad thing.

397
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
No way!

398
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,500
What are you talking about?

399
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,500
You were 100% sure about it.

400
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,500
It's hard to explain just by looking at it partially!

401
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,000
Iori-kun, marry Chisaa-chan.

402
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
What?

403
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,500
Wait, what are you talking about?

404
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,500
Are you angry?

405
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,500
You're going to kill me?

406
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,500
Of course I'm angry.

407
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,500
I thought about it.

408
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,500
But Chisaa-chan is important, too.

409
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,500
I know you're a good girl.

410
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,500
Nanaka-san!

411
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
If you're happy, I won't kill you.

412
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,500
Thank you!

413
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,500
What are you talking about?

414
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,500
Leave it to me.

415
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,500
What do you mean?

416
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,500
Nanaka-san is in a panic.

417
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,500
Once she gets married, she'll listen to me.

418
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,500
What do you think my life is?

419
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Then you're going to marry me?

420
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,500
No way!

421
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,500
I won't do it!

422
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,500
What are you talking about?

423
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,500
Shiori?

424
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,500
I'm sorry.

425
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,500
I'm sorry.

426
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,500
I'm sorry.

427
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,500
I'm sorry.

428
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,500
I'm sorry.

429
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,500
I'm sorry.

430
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,500
I'm sorry.

431
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,500
I'm sorry.

432
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,500
I'm sorry.

433
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,500
I'm sorry.

434
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,500
I'm sorry.

435
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,500
I'm sorry.

436
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,500
I'm sorry.

437
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,500
I'm sorry.

438
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,500
I'm sorry.

439
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,500
I'm sorry.

440
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,500
I'm sorry.

441
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,500
I'm sorry.

442
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,500
I'm sorry.

443
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,500
I'm sorry.

444
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,500
I'm sorry.

445
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,500
I'm sorry.

446
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,500
I'm sorry.

447
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,500
I'm sorry.

448
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,500
I'm sorry.

449
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,500
I'm sorry.

450
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,500
I'm sorry.

451
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,500
I'm sorry.

452
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,000
I'm sorry.
