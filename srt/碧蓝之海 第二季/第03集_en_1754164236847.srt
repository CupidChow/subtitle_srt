Chapter 3

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Farewell, Brother Kouhei! Brother! Brother!

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Is your parents a inn and you're in love with your brother? If that's the case, then let's go to the inn.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Brother, my lover, my mother...

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You two are going back to the inn.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Wow, you were such a cute little girl.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I don't think she's Iori's sister.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
But why did you suddenly come here?

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Oh, you said that yesterday.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You said you felt like Chii-chan and Iori were getting married, so you flew here.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Is that the feeling of being brothers?

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The strong bond between brothers, huh?

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What are you doing?

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm Shiori-chan's brother.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
In other words, I feel her too!

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I want to drink alcohol.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Not you!

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The inn, lover, and the next one...

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If, if Iori and Ana get into this and that...

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
If they both get married and I... I...

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm the god...

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm not the god!

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But you're more worried about Chii-chan and Iori.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Even though they're under the same roof...

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You're pretty worried, aren't you?

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Haha, that's true.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Even though they're actually blood-related cousins.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What?

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Meinung

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

67
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,960
One more time.

68
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,960
Let's go!

69
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,960
Blue sea road, let's go!

70
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,960
It's always a new season.

71
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,960
Get high!

72
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,960
Keep on!

73
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,960
Let's become adults and have a good show!

74
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,960
Let's search for a new world and dive in!

75
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,960
Youth is

76
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,960
to keep on going forward.

77
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,960
Youth is

78
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,960
to never let go of your youth.

79
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,960
Youth is

80
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,960
to keep on wandering.

81
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,960
Forever.

82
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

83
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

84
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

85
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

86
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

87
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

88
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

89
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

90
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

91
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

92
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

93
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

94
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

95
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

96
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,960
Stop!

97
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,960
Huh? What's wrong?

98
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,960
I feel really weird.

99
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,960
What do you mean you don't understand?

100
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,960
It's so hard to keep up with him.

101
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,960
I know. What's going on between us?

102
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,960
I don't know, but

103
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,960
I think we should go out for coffee now.

104
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,960
You mean we should kill time?

105
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,960
If Kebako is in that state,

106
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,960
there's nothing good about it.

107
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,960
Well, maybe.

108
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,960
Then, how about a cafe you recommend?

109
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,960
Or a cafe with a nice view?

110
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,960
Where are you two going?

111
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,960
Nothing special.

112
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,960
Then let's go inside.

113
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,960
It's just the time to have fun at the baseball stadium.

114
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,960
Everyone, come home!

115
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,960
What?

116
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,960
I don't know what happened.

117
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,960
This is bad.

118
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,960
I think he drank a strong alcohol.

119
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,960
Is it true that Iori and Chisa's blood are not connected?

120
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,960
Oh, you didn't say that?

121
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,960
Huh?

122
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,960
No, that's not true.

123
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,960
What's wrong?

124
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,960
Why are you so upset?

125
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,960
I was relieved because I thought it was a good place.

126
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,960
I didn't know they had no blood connection.

127
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,960
Maybe they already have children.

128
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,960
Let's calm down.

129
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,960
Why do you suddenly have children?

130
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,960
They can't do it.

131
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,960
Really?

132
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,960
They're fine.

133
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,960
I don't know what you're saying in front of your father.

134
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,960
What's important is the feelings of the two.

135
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,960
Well, I don't know.

136
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,960
I don't know what they're thinking.

137
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,960
I don't think they're hiding something.

138
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,960
I'm sure they're hiding it from the public.

139
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:17,960
If that's the case, let's cooperate to find out the truth.

140
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,960
Is that okay?

141
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,960
It's a case that can't be overlooked.

142
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,960
Then let's cooperate and find out the truth about them.

143
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,960
By the way, why are you asking?

144
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,960
For the sake of the daughter of the circle.

145
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,960
Welcome back, you two.

146
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,960
I'm back.

147
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,960
Do you want to be a spiritus or a baseball?

148
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,960
Don't be so merciless.

149
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,960
Aina, did something happen?

150
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,960
You don't seem to be drunk.

151
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,960
Nothing.

152
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,960
I'm sure they won't tell the truth.

153
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,960
So I'll let them down and pull out the truth.

154
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,960
I think this is good.

155
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,960
It's suspicious.

156
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,960
It's not like that.

157
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,960
I'm drinking with you and playing baseball.

158
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,960
I don't care.

159
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,960
Really?

160
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,960
However...

161
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,960
If you can participate in the game in that state...

162
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,960
I won't do it after all.

163
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,960
I don't know what you were planning, but I'll give up.

164
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,960
Really?

165
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,960
Really?

166
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,960
Then let's get started.

167
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,960
What?

168
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,960
What are you so prepared for?

169
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,960
It's just a swimsuit.

170
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,960
I'm not embarrassed.

171
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,960
I'm scared.

172
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,960
You put on too much makeup.

173
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,960
I'm on guard.

174
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,960
I'm scared.

175
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,960
I understand.

176
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,960
Hey, Kitahara.

177
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,960
I have a question for you.

178
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,960
What is it?

179
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,960
I was playing a beautiful girl game at home the other day.

180
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,960
The most beautiful thing in that game was the protagonist's appearance.

181
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,960
You're good at bringing up the game.

182
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,960
So I want to hear your opinion on the connection between blood and love.

183
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,960
Kitahara, what do you actually think?

184
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,960
I'm a sister to Shiori.

185
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,960
It's not like that.

186
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,960
You know that Shiori is my real sister.

187
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,960
That's why it's possible to get excited.

188
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,960
I don't have such a thing.

189
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,960
If you're an ordinary person...

190
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,960
What?

191
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,960
I'll just make sure.

192
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,960
What?

193
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,960
So, Azusa.

194
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,960
Love.

195
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,960
Impression game?

196
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,960
Yes.

197
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,960
When the person who appears in the game gives a suggestion,

198
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,960
the person who fits the impression is given a hint.

199
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,960
It's simple.

200
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,960
It's just a drinking game.

201
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,960
It's just right to be able to do it with a drunk head.

202
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,960
Sometimes it's different, but it's okay.

203
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,960
It's always baseball.

204
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,960
That's true.

205
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,960
Then let's start.

206
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,960
Impression game.

207
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,960
Yeah.

208
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,960
The topic is, does blue look good on you?

209
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,960
Yeah.

210
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,960
One, two.

211
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,960
Do I look like blue?

212
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,960
You do.

213
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,960
It's the impression of a hoodie or a shirt.

214
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,960
It smells blue.

215
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,960
Then Iori will be punished.

216
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,960
I see.

217
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,960
Is it beer?

218
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,960
Is it sour?

219
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,960
No, it's not that today.

220
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,960
I'll drink this water.

221
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,960
Water?

222
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,960
Water.

223
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,960
It's really just water.

224
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,960
I see.

225
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,960
Are you okay?

226
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,960
Do you want water?

227
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,960
If you don't notice...

228
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,960
Then Iori will be the next one to lose.

229
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,960
I see.

230
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,960
The topic is, what's your impression?

231
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,960
That's right.

232
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,960
Then...

233
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,960
Impression game.

234
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,960
The topic is, who's got a long bath?

235
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,960
One, two.

236
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,960
Really?

237
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,960
Iori looks like that.

238
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,960
It's like a inefficient bath.

239
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,960
Maybe.

240
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,960
Here's the punishment game.

241
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,960
I want to avoid three losses.

242
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,960
This is not a cowardly place.

243
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,960
I'll shoot one person.

244
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,960
Impression game.

245
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,960
The topic is, who's the most like an otaku?

246
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,960
One, two.

247
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,960
Why?

248
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,960
It's weird to have this guy.

249
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,960
That's not true.

250
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,960
I used to be an otaku, too.

251
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,960
You still say that.

252
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,960
That's an impression game.

253
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,960
It's not like that.

254
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,960
It's not?

255
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,960
Is that so?

256
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,960
Here's the punishment game.

257
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,960
It's fine. Let's go next.

258
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,960
You're motivated.

259
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,960
As expected of Iori.

260
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,960
This time, I'll take on a topic that might be different from mine.

261
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,960
Impression game.

262
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,960
Hey! You haven't started yet!

263
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,960
Oh, really?

264
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,960
You moved your hands too early.

265
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,960
That's not in the game.

266
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,960
Don't worry about the details.

267
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,960
It's less than three rounds if you lose.

268
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,960
I'm frustrated.

269
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,960
I don't think so.

270
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,960
I'll do it!

271
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,960
Do it!

272
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,960
That's what a man does!

273
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,960
It's started.

274
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,960
Now I'll just wait for Iori to take the water.

275
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,960
Hey, Iori.

276
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,960
Why do you look so fine?

277
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,960
What?

278
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,960
Didn't you notice?

279
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,960
What?

280
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,960
This is just water.

281
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,960
No way!

282
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,960
I'm sure I...

283
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,960
I'm sorry.

284
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,960
I was just pretending to drink and almost spilled it.

285
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,960
I'm sorry.

286
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,960
Hey, good job.

287
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,960
I'm so tired.

288
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,960
So what was that?

289
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,960
Actually...

290
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,960
What?

291
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,960
My dad is just a good man.

292
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,960
So what's it like with Chisa?

293
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,960
I can't really explain it.

294
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,960
They're like friends of the same age.

295
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,960
So I can't really tell.

296
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,960
I see.

297
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,960
So Azusa and Nanaka are different?

298
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,960
Of course they're friends.

299
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:56,960
But they're older sisters.

300
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:03,960
So I honestly think that Nanaka is a bad guy.

301
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,960
Nanaka, what was that?

302
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,960
I'm sorry, Iori.

303
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,960
I have to call my friend.

304
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,960
No!

305
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:28,960
Nanaka, that's what an old man is like.

306
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,960
That's not like Chisa.

307
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,960
Don't cry.

308
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,960
You'll get to see him again.

309
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,960
That's not what I meant!

310
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,960
That's not what I meant!

311
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,960
You're getting a little cold.

312
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,960
Thank you.

313
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,960
You're going to sleep in that outfit.

314
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,960
I'm embarrassed.

315
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,960
I'm sorry, I had a show.

316
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,960
The manager isn't here, is he?

317
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,960
It's okay.

318
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,960
My sister is here, and my dad will be home soon.

319
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,960
Iori left me, too.

320
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,960
I see.

321
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,960
If it's just you and Nanaka, that idiot is a real fool.

322
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,960
It's a nice day, Nanaka.

323
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,960
I know.

324
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,960
It's sunny and hot outside, Nanaka.

325
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,960
I know.

326
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,960
Nanaka.

327
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,960
What is it, Iori?

328
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,960
Can you sit a little closer?

329
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,960
I've been liking this sofa lately.

330
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,960
I see.

331
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,960
I can't believe he's going to pull the king this far.

332
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,960
You're looking at me with a ferocious eye.

333
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,960
This is the best way to get rid of this disgusting atmosphere.

334
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,960
What Nanaka likes is...

335
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,960
Nanaka.

336
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,960
I think...

337
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,960
Chisa is cute, isn't she?

338
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,960
She's smart and can cook.

339
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,960
She's kind and cold.

340
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,960
She knows a lot about the sea.

341
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,960
She's a good friend of yours, Nanaka.

342
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,960
Did you film it?

343
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,960
I don't think so.

344
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,960
That's fine, but if you're free, read the book.

345
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,960
Okay, thank you.

346
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,960
Wait, Chisa, the book is...

347
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,960
The Book of the Sea

348
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:35,960
Now that we've gotten even closer, I want to make a statement.

349
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,960
I want to prove that I didn't mean to do that.

350
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,960
But there's one problem here.

351
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,960
I'm actually looking at you with a ferocious eye.

352
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,960
Even if I lie about that, I'll be exposed immediately.

353
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,960
That's not where I should make a statement.

354
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,960
What's important is...

355
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,960
I see.

356
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,960
Then it's no use looking at it with that kind of eye.

357
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,960
That's right.

358
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,960
...is what I want you to accept.

359
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,960
In other words, I want to tell you the truth.

360
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,960
Please listen, Nanaka.

361
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,960
Yes.

362
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,960
I'll be honest with you.

363
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,960
Nanaka's body is an eroin.

364
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,960
What? What did I do wrong?

365
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,960
Nanaka.

366
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,960
What?

367
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,960
I'll go get the wet clothes outside.

368
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,960
Then I'll...

369
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,960
No, I'll do it myself.

370
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,960
Now, that was the opposite effect of earlier.

371
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,960
Now I'll try to act like a gentleman.

372
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,960
I'll drink the wind, young lady.

373
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,960
Well...

374
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,960
It's over.

375
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,960
Thank you.

376
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,960
I can have lunch now.

377
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,960
It's already that late?

378
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,960
It's hot.

379
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,960
Are you okay, Nanaka?

380
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,960
You look tired.

381
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,960
It's nothing.

382
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,960
No, it's not that hard.

383
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,960
Let's take this off.

384
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,960
What's wrong, Nanaka?

385
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,960
You know, Azu...

386
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,960
I think Yori will take responsibility for this.

387
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,960
What's going on over there?

388
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,960
Let me sort out my thoughts.

389
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,960
People avoid loneliness and isolation.

390
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,960
That's the instinctive fear of living in a group.

391
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,960
The fact that you're the only one specializing in it

392
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,960
is a result of your loneliness and isolation.

393
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,960
Then I should tell you something right now.

394
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,960
Nanaka.

395
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,960
I won't take it off.

396
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,960
No, you can leave that aside.

397
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,960
I can only leave it aside.

398
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,960
Please remember this.

399
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,960
Okay.

400
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,960
I can see Azu's body through your erotic eyes.

401
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,960
I didn't know you could see through that kind of thing.

402
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,960
That's not what I meant.

403
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,960
I'm not just looking at you with that kind of look.

404
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,960
I want you to be at ease.

405
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,960
I see.

406
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,960
Nanaka is not good at talking like that.

407
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,960
I'm fine with people talking about me.

408
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,960
Is that so?

409
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,960
But you have to get used to it.

410
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,960
You're right.

411
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,960
Nanaka, you know, Yori is a boy.

412
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,960
You have to forgive him for looking at you with that kind of look.

413
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,960
Azusa, you're doing this for me?

414
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,960
But it's hard to deal with a boy all of a sudden.

415
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,960
Let's try something different with someone we're the same age.

416
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,960
This is a different goal.

417
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,960
Azusa, that's a no.

418
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,960
Was it a no?

419
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,960
No, no, no.

420
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,960
Then let's go drink.

421
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,960
What? Why would you do that?

422
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,960
When Nanaka is depressed, it's best to go drink.

423
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,960
And then?

424
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,960
What?

425
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,960
Let's make Nanaka drink together.

426
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,960
What?

427
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,960
No?

428
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,960
Of course not!

429
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
Why not?

430
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,960
Nanaka is attractive as a girl,

431
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,960
but I think she's like my real sister.

432
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,960
So I can't do that.

433
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,960
So you're treating her like your real sister.

434
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,960
Well, yes.

435
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,960
I see.

436
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,960
Well done.

437
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,960
This is a rare combination.

438
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,960
So you came back to drink with me?

439
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,960
And then?

440
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,960
You called me your sister?

441
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,960
I'm glad you came.

442
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,960
I can't do that to you.

443
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,960
Was it a bother?

444
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,960
No, it was a help.

445
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,960
You can't leave the other girls to the other girls.

446
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,960
You're right.

447
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,960
I can't imagine those three dating.

448
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,960
Tokki doesn't talk about her at all.

449
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,960
You're having a hard time, too.

450
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,960
I know.

451
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,960
When you're done, you can't move.

452
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,960
You should move before you can move.

453
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,960
I'm going to break you!

454
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,960
I can't move.

455
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,960
Buki, can I have your drink?

456
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,960
You're drinking, Nanaka.

457
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,960
I can't lose.

458
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,960
So those four girls are now in a relationship.

459
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,960
I'll drink for you, too.

460
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,960
You're drinking a lot.

461
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,960
Chisa...

462
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,960
I'm not interested in that book.

463
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,960
I'll leave it at that.

464
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,960
You're leaving it at that.

465
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,960
Don't you want a boyfriend?

466
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,960
What's wrong with you?

467
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,960
You're a fake boyfriend and girlfriend.

468
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,960
It's convenient to have a boyfriend.

469
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,960
Is that enough?

470
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,960
Do you want a girlfriend?

471
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,960
I wonder.

472
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,960
Am I the only one who thinks about that?

473
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,960
I'm thinking about that all the time in that circle.

474
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,960
Let's go back to the jungle and drink!

475
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,960
Let's drink!

476
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,960
Let's drink!

477
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,960
So, you're not going to borrow it?

478
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,960
Really?

479
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,960
To be continued...

480
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,960
It's so thick.
