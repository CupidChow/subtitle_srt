1
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:25,859
WALK

2
00:01:29,682 --> 00:01:34,170
My father and I inherited the craft of
making bamboo beds from Grandpa Daniel.

3
00:01:34,404 --> 00:01:37,483
That's what kept our family going.

4
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:49,708
People often said
his work was the best,

5
00:01:50,138 --> 00:01:53,721
polished and top quality.

6
00:02:34,723 --> 00:02:38,379
I've been with a lot of women in my bed,

7
00:02:38,888 --> 00:02:42,916
but Laura's the one
I'm going to marry.

8
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,197
Ouch!

9
00:06:14,321 --> 00:06:15,837
- What the heck?
- You devil!

10
00:06:15,862 --> 00:06:17,356
The pawnshop just texted!

11
00:06:17,464 --> 00:06:19,736
You animal! Don't tell me
you pawned our wedding rings.

12
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:21,403
Damn it, I swear I'll kill you!

13
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,000
- Well... it's just that...
- What?

14
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,288
I lost in online gambling...
on the internet!

15
00:06:27,445 --> 00:06:29,304
Online gambling again?

16
00:06:40,325 --> 00:06:42,508
Hey, I'm sorry.

17
00:06:42,933 --> 00:06:44,764
I really didn't want to gamble again.

18
00:06:45,126 --> 00:06:47,553
But I just took a chance.

19
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:52,259
You know I wanted to at least
contribute something to our wedding.

20
00:06:52,771 --> 00:06:54,732
Promise, I'll get it back.

21
00:06:54,757 --> 00:06:56,120
I'll find a way.

22
00:06:56,145 --> 00:06:57,650
I mean well.

23
00:06:58,747 --> 00:07:01,641
You know how much
that ring means to me!

24
00:07:03,551 --> 00:07:06,806
That's the most important keepsake
I have from my grandma.

25
00:07:07,826 --> 00:07:10,561
My grandmother who raised me!

26
00:07:11,922 --> 00:07:14,056
Have you forgotten that?

27
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,539
I swear I didn't mean for that to happen.

28
00:07:16,563 --> 00:07:18,373
I really thought I could get it,

29
00:07:18,398 --> 00:07:20,218
but I was just unlucky.

30
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,484
Please, believe me, it wasn't my intention.

31
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,637
I'll make it up to you.

32
00:07:24,665 --> 00:07:25,740
You're such a gambler!

33
00:07:27,235 --> 00:07:30,277
My grandma treasured all her jewelry,

34
00:07:30,563 --> 00:07:31,698
and she even had it melted

35
00:07:31,723 --> 00:07:33,119
down to make our wedding rings.

36
00:07:34,175 --> 00:07:36,870
And this is what'll you do?

37
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,416
Hmm?

38
00:07:40,988 --> 00:07:42,032
I'm sorry, okay?

39
00:07:42,056 --> 00:07:45,209
I really didn't mean for that to happen.

40
00:07:45,324 --> 00:07:46,833
I honestly thought I was going to win,

41
00:07:46,857 --> 00:07:48,678
but I just had terrible luck.

42
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:50,617
My intentions weren't bad.

43
00:07:50,642 --> 00:07:53,343
It's just that damn online gambling!

44
00:07:53,368 --> 00:07:54,928
Why did it even have to become a thing?

45
00:07:55,326 --> 00:07:56,326
Shit!

46
00:08:01,361 --> 00:08:02,893
I'm going to sell you.

47
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,013
What?

48
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:08,998
Hey, help me out.

49
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:20,720
Now grab me a t-shirt and shorts.

50
00:08:21,652 --> 00:08:22,774
Quick.

51
00:08:46,468 --> 00:08:48,153
Bed for sale!

52
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,822
Bed for sale!

53
00:09:30,563 --> 00:09:33,108
My dad said I was
named Lennon because

54
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:36,029
my mom was into the Beatles
when she was pregnant with me.

55
00:09:36,518 --> 00:09:41,142
Almost everyone in our
neighborhood loves the Beatles.

56
00:09:42,065 --> 00:09:47,738
But I'm not a fan of my name...
I'm not into music.

57
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:51,329
I'm into basketball.

58
00:10:02,715 --> 00:10:04,890
- For you, bro!
- Oh, thanks, bro!

59
00:10:05,932 --> 00:10:08,747
- I need like 30 minutes to stretch out.
- Just 30 minutes!

60
00:10:09,171 --> 00:10:12,314
I'll just be quick,
only 30 minutes.

61
00:10:13,472 --> 00:10:16,441
- When you're done, make sure to clean up.
- Sure, man.

62
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,145
- Ten pesos for me, bro.
- Okay.

63
00:10:30,305 --> 00:10:31,616
What's a wooden bed doing here?

64
00:10:31,811 --> 00:10:33,917
Oh, I'm selling it, sir.

65
00:10:34,312 --> 00:10:35,564
Oh really?

66
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:37,763
You made that?

67
00:10:37,788 --> 00:10:38,841
Yes.

68
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,987
How much?

69
00:10:41,285 --> 00:10:42,428
It's just 2500 pesos, sir!

70
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,189
- Your order's done, sir!
- Wait a sec.

71
00:10:44,252 --> 00:10:46,132
I'll give you a discount
if you push me harder.

72
00:10:46,157 --> 00:10:47,203
Go ahead, and take it!

73
00:10:47,718 --> 00:10:49,038
Does that guy come
with the 2500?

74
00:10:49,634 --> 00:10:50,634
Uh...

75
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,560
Ex-deal.

76
00:10:55,546 --> 00:10:56,857
Wait, let me look at it first.

77
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,316
- Looks sturdy.
- Mhm!

78
00:11:00,476 --> 00:11:01,602
Did you make this?

79
00:11:02,618 --> 00:11:03,618
Yes, sir!

80
00:11:04,076 --> 00:11:05,144
I built that myself.

81
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,478
It's rock-solid!

82
00:11:10,738 --> 00:11:11,990
But this looks like it's already been used!

83
00:11:12,014 --> 00:11:13,427
No, sir...

84
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:15,937
only, you know, almost everyday.

85
00:11:16,028 --> 00:11:17,250
Just kidding!

86
00:11:17,628 --> 00:11:19,722
But you know what, day beds

87
00:11:19,747 --> 00:11:21,488
like this can be used for a lot of things.

88
00:11:21,954 --> 00:11:23,751
You can even use it as a dining table.

89
00:11:24,293 --> 00:11:29,893
I remember, my siblings and I used to
sleep on a wooden bed like this.

90
00:11:30,716 --> 00:11:33,847
But kids these days
don't want to lie on one!

91
00:11:33,872 --> 00:11:37,313
They don't realize it's
actually better for the body.

92
00:11:38,057 --> 00:11:41,118
They probably have no idea
they were made on a wooden bed.

93
00:11:42,711 --> 00:11:43,876
Do you have a family?

94
00:11:43,901 --> 00:11:46,330
Ah! I'm getting married soon, sir.

95
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,741
That's why I'm rushing to sell this.

96
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,993
Oh! Congrats!

97
00:11:51,108 --> 00:11:52,328
Thank you.

98
00:11:52,605 --> 00:11:56,021
But getting married is expensive.

99
00:11:56,364 --> 00:11:57,574
Tell me about it.

100
00:12:00,055 --> 00:12:02,064
- You want some?
- No, thank you, sir.

101
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:07,133
But you know sir, it's
tougher without money.

102
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:08,937
Yeah, you're right.

103
00:12:10,678 --> 00:12:13,733
So... sir, go ahead and buy it.

104
00:12:14,325 --> 00:12:17,372
That way I'll have money to get
back the ring for my future wife.

105
00:12:17,975 --> 00:12:19,043
What?

106
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:22,669
You pawned your wedding ring?

107
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,125
Why?

108
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:27,384
Got myself in a predicament.

109
00:12:27,992 --> 00:12:28,992
Well...

110
00:12:30,308 --> 00:12:32,588
I still bet even when I don't
really have anything to bet.

111
00:12:33,537 --> 00:12:35,616
Just taking my chances, you know?

112
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:38,241
Turns out your mistake was pretty big.

113
00:12:39,561 --> 00:12:40,561
I know.

114
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:44,016
That's why every time I carry this bed,

115
00:12:44,566 --> 00:12:47,122
I feel my mistakes even more.

116
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:49,899
But what can I do... Man?

117
00:12:50,052 --> 00:12:52,545
You know I've been trying to
sell this all day, and nothing.

118
00:12:53,322 --> 00:12:54,720
Just bad luck, man.

119
00:12:54,765 --> 00:12:56,161
Wow, that must be exhausting.

120
00:12:57,233 --> 00:12:59,058
You've probably been everywhere by now.

121
00:13:00,086 --> 00:13:01,806
How are you going to get the ring back now?

122
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,680
Bed for sale!

123
00:13:11,902 --> 00:13:13,135
Bed for sale!

124
00:13:20,898 --> 00:13:21,911
Bed for sale!

125
00:13:21,936 --> 00:13:24,173
I've been all over the place,

126
00:13:24,676 --> 00:13:27,359
and I've run into all sorts of people.

127
00:13:27,712 --> 00:13:28,984
Bed for sale!

128
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:35,458
Hey, bro!

129
00:13:35,557 --> 00:13:37,880
- What is it?
- Mind if I rent your bed?

130
00:13:38,622 --> 00:13:39,737
- Come on!
- Rent?

131
00:13:39,761 --> 00:13:41,659
It's really itchy! hurry, I'm naked.

132
00:13:41,684 --> 00:13:42,694
Rent?

133
00:13:42,719 --> 00:13:44,291
- Come here!
- How much?

134
00:13:44,914 --> 00:13:46,413
- Hey! What are you...
- Come on!

135
00:13:46,798 --> 00:13:49,098
- 275 pesos!
- Yeah, sure.

136
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:50,269
Come on.

137
00:13:50,606 --> 00:13:51,927
Oh! Who's that?

138
00:13:52,505 --> 00:13:54,665
It wasn't part of the plan
that someone else will join.

139
00:13:55,465 --> 00:13:56,486
Bianca!

140
00:13:56,865 --> 00:13:58,743
This is my girlfriend, Bianca.

141
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:00,306
What's your name?

142
00:14:00,331 --> 00:14:02,867
- Lawin.
- His name is Lawin. Okay, come on!

143
00:14:02,917 --> 00:14:04,237
- Where are we going?
- Over here.

144
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:06,865
He's gonna lend his bed to us.

145
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,614
Wait. Lend what? You
said you're renting it out.

146
00:14:08,638 --> 00:14:10,078
Yeah, yeah!
Hurry, it's really heavy!

147
00:14:10,358 --> 00:14:11,374
Come on! Over there!

148
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:12,617
- Where?
- Yeah, right there.

149
00:14:13,092 --> 00:14:14,772
Keep going, keep going.

150
00:14:14,973 --> 00:14:16,670
Put it down there.

151
00:14:17,177 --> 00:14:19,049
Yeah, there, there, push it
back a little, a little more.

152
00:14:19,073 --> 00:14:20,291
- Here.
- Yeah, put it down.

153
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,922
- Move it over, to the other side.
- Where?

154
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:25,789
Yeah, put it down. Over there!

155
00:14:26,311 --> 00:14:27,509
Okay, I'll lift it.

156
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:28,710
Okay, a bit more.

157
00:14:29,748 --> 00:14:30,748
That's it!

158
00:14:31,395 --> 00:14:33,075
Why here of all places?

159
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:34,550
Don't get involved!

160
00:14:34,797 --> 00:14:36,431
I'm done with motels, I hate the smell...

161
00:14:36,455 --> 00:14:37,509
Go on, keep moving it.

162
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:38,819
- Fine!
- Move it to the side!

163
00:14:38,843 --> 00:14:39,978
A bit more! There!

164
00:14:40,351 --> 00:14:41,364
Okay.

165
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:44,186
Their laundry soap
doesn't even get it out.

166
00:14:44,372 --> 00:14:47,597
There are still cum stains on the sheets.

167
00:14:47,671 --> 00:14:48,926
Go on, set it aside.

168
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,818
It should've been properly washed!

169
00:14:51,436 --> 00:14:54,812
At least here, we're in nature.

170
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,736
I feel like we're Adam and Eve.

171
00:14:59,521 --> 00:15:01,942
- Seriously, you’re unbelievable!
- Go on.

172
00:15:02,409 --> 00:15:04,217
Go on, get over there and keep watch.

173
00:15:07,008 --> 00:15:08,008
Go!

174
00:16:29,713 --> 00:16:31,073
What the hell are you doing there?

175
00:16:32,307 --> 00:16:33,307
Go there!

176
00:16:33,824 --> 00:16:35,217
I said keep watch.

177
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,188
So, was the dude’s dick big?

178
00:17:31,213 --> 00:17:34,056
I mean... how much did that
couple in the bushes even pay you?

179
00:17:34,239 --> 00:17:36,785
Was it enough to cover
for your ring?

180
00:17:38,661 --> 00:17:39,960
That's Ka Ellie!

181
00:17:39,984 --> 00:17:42,939
You barely got back from the market
and you’re already gossiping.

182
00:17:52,431 --> 00:17:57,405
Just one lottery win, and all
my problems would be gone.

183
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,031
Maybe I could even take
care of your problems too!

184
00:18:00,642 --> 00:18:03,642
But I really don’t want to bet anymore.

185
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:04,960
It’s too much.

186
00:18:05,379 --> 00:18:08,129
I might even gamble away
our future, mine, and Laura’s.

187
00:18:09,034 --> 00:18:10,634
Nope, not happening.

188
00:18:11,167 --> 00:18:13,136
This time, I’m making sure I win.

189
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:20,339
Bed for sale!

190
00:18:22,981 --> 00:18:24,219
Bed for sale!

191
00:18:25,825 --> 00:18:28,521
Sturdiest bed for sale!

192
00:18:30,213 --> 00:18:32,226
Bed for sale!

193
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:34,446
- Bed?
- Oh! Miss! Watch it!

194
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,072
Miss!

195
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,099
How much is that?

196
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,176
Uh, 2500 pesos.

197
00:18:43,434 --> 00:18:46,162
I'll give you a discount
if you try to convince me.

198
00:18:48,912 --> 00:18:50,195
I'm not asking for a discount.

199
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:54,450
Let me check.

200
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,786
It seems sturdy.

201
00:19:01,564 --> 00:19:04,037
The color is nice.
I like it.

202
00:19:05,191 --> 00:19:06,231
Is it sturdy?

203
00:19:07,155 --> 00:19:08,155
Hmm...

204
00:19:15,596 --> 00:19:16,752
Put it in.

205
00:19:17,146 --> 00:19:18,146
Ma'am?

206
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:20,934
The bed.

207
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,440
Come, follow me.

208
00:19:23,698 --> 00:19:24,935
I will check it first.

209
00:20:01,002 --> 00:20:02,094
Eat first.

210
00:20:02,944 --> 00:20:04,231
So, what's your name?

211
00:20:04,706 --> 00:20:06,126
They call me Lawin (hawk).

212
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:07,953
The hawk is a fearless bird.

213
00:20:08,377 --> 00:20:09,537
Are you bold enough to match?

214
00:20:10,935 --> 00:20:12,398
Depends on the fight.

215
00:20:14,074 --> 00:20:15,618
Hey, you know how to answer!

216
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,611
Go, eat some more.

217
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:20,094
Um...

218
00:20:20,499 --> 00:20:21,973
Ma'am... Can I go now?

219
00:20:21,998 --> 00:20:23,406
Are you in a hurry?

220
00:20:25,301 --> 00:20:27,018
Is there anything else
I need to do here?

221
00:20:28,107 --> 00:20:29,587
There’s something I’d like you to do.

222
00:20:32,488 --> 00:20:33,488
Sure.

223
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:36,275
I'm game as long as I can do it.

224
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,855
I'm sure you can do it.

225
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:39,788
Go, eat some more.

226
00:20:44,352 --> 00:20:45,729
Have a drink.

227
00:20:48,671 --> 00:20:49,793
Have a sit.

228
00:20:54,542 --> 00:20:55,579
Eat some more.

229
00:20:55,604 --> 00:20:57,051
You look so tired.

230
00:20:58,855 --> 00:20:59,932
Where have you been?

231
00:20:59,957 --> 00:21:01,418
You must've travelled quite far.

232
00:21:01,813 --> 00:21:03,569
Go on, eat some more.

233
00:21:05,165 --> 00:21:06,925
Make sure you get full…
Finish it all, okay?

234
00:21:09,408 --> 00:21:11,202
You’re all sweaty.

235
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,429
Wait a sec… you’re really sweaty.

236
00:21:20,453 --> 00:21:21,974
You must’ve come from pretty far away.

237
00:21:22,276 --> 00:21:23,837
A little…

238
00:21:27,091 --> 00:21:28,351
- Stand up.
- Oh, uh...

239
00:21:29,734 --> 00:21:31,184
Come on… Take that off already.

240
00:21:33,303 --> 00:21:35,320
You’re soaked in sweat!

241
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:40,150
Don't act so modest. Come on.

242
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:47,224
Wow, nice body.

243
00:21:49,658 --> 00:21:51,327
You’re really sweaty.

244
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:45,810
Oh...

245
00:23:47,952 --> 00:23:50,485
Oh, there's something over here too...

246
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:08,362
Hold on, hold on.

247
00:26:09,055 --> 00:26:10,895
If that was just the
woman’s imagination,

248
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:12,554
how did you know?

249
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:14,641
Right? Stop messing with us!

250
00:26:15,099 --> 00:26:16,810
Maybe it's just your imagination!

251
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,274
So, what would you rather do?

252
00:26:20,062 --> 00:26:21,342
Story, or debate?

253
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,639
Exactly!

254
00:26:23,687 --> 00:26:25,876
That’s his story.
So, let him be.

255
00:26:25,901 --> 00:26:27,006
Keep it going, bro!

256
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:30,895
Sorry, man.

257
00:26:31,234 --> 00:26:32,502
So, what happened next?

258
00:26:33,034 --> 00:26:34,234
Please proceed.

259
00:26:35,972 --> 00:26:36,972
Oh!

260
00:26:37,101 --> 00:26:38,732
You're so wet.

261
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,461
Honey!

262
00:26:56,739 --> 00:26:58,419
- Shoot!
- That’s Dax, my husband!

263
00:26:59,334 --> 00:27:00,694
Hide over here!

264
00:27:01,905 --> 00:27:03,298
- Where?
- Honey!

265
00:27:03,352 --> 00:27:04,352
Below here!

266
00:27:08,883 --> 00:27:09,883
Dax!

267
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,060
Honey!

268
00:27:11,608 --> 00:27:12,608
Hon!

269
00:27:14,154 --> 00:27:15,323
Why is the gate open?

270
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,374
And the hose is all over the place.

271
00:27:24,817 --> 00:27:26,728
What is that again?

272
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:31,324
Son of a… you keep
buying all sorts of stuff!

273
00:27:31,822 --> 00:27:33,854
I just thought the
design was nice.

274
00:27:34,377 --> 00:27:38,674
You’ve got such a habit of
buying stuff you don’t really need.

275
00:27:39,413 --> 00:27:41,791
But I love the design.

276
00:27:42,801 --> 00:27:43,989
Looks good?

277
00:27:44,224 --> 00:27:45,617
- Hmm?
- It's nice.

278
00:27:46,323 --> 00:27:47,663
Oh wow.

279
00:27:47,725 --> 00:27:49,488
Oh, honey! Hang on!

280
00:27:50,195 --> 00:27:51,874
I bought you some noodles!

281
00:27:52,011 --> 00:27:54,263
It's still quite hot!

282
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:58,378
- Just like me.
- Yummy!

283
00:28:01,181 --> 00:28:02,864
Babe? Are you possessed?

284
00:28:02,964 --> 00:28:05,101
Oh wow, honey!

285
00:28:05,126 --> 00:28:06,126
Babe?

286
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:10,189
Oh my!

287
00:28:10,547 --> 00:28:16,001
Are you possessed? Honey?

288
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:17,940
Honey!

289
00:28:37,071 --> 00:28:38,706
You’re like a demon!

290
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,060
Honey?

291
00:28:54,444 --> 00:28:55,717
Come over here.

292
00:28:58,309 --> 00:29:00,890
You’ve been possessed, babe!

293
00:29:01,398 --> 00:29:03,611
You’ve been possessed, babe!

294
00:30:20,181 --> 00:30:22,181
I'm close! I'm close!

295
00:30:22,307 --> 00:30:23,333
I'm close!

296
00:30:36,526 --> 00:30:37,526
Damn, babe!

297
00:30:37,889 --> 00:30:38,889
Damn, babe!

298
00:30:39,768 --> 00:30:42,821
Oh, honey, you're so hot!

299
00:30:50,218 --> 00:30:52,129
- Who's that?
- Nothing… Don't mind it.

300
00:30:52,154 --> 00:30:54,723
- Who's that?
- Just keep going.

301
00:30:55,828 --> 00:30:58,614
One, two, three, four.

302
00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:01,529
Keep going, keep going!

303
00:31:02,036 --> 00:31:04,722
One, two, three, four.

304
00:31:08,692 --> 00:31:09,692
Shit!

305
00:31:11,017 --> 00:31:12,814
Damn, mission accomplished!

306
00:31:16,327 --> 00:31:17,327
Wow, babe!

307
00:31:20,544 --> 00:31:22,124
Your powers are insane! Shit!

308
00:31:36,305 --> 00:31:37,305
I better take a bath now.

309
00:31:37,732 --> 00:31:39,010
Go ahead and take a bath.

310
00:31:42,945 --> 00:31:43,945
My god.

311
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,152
Salute!

312
00:32:10,503 --> 00:32:11,503
My god.

313
00:32:13,154 --> 00:32:18,786
Forgive me, I almost got mad at you
for buying that bed…

314
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:23,544
- But damn, it’s tough...
- I told you.

315
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:25,597
Better than Viagra!

316
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,160
Alright, that’s enough!
Go take a shower.

317
00:32:28,242 --> 00:32:29,720
- Why?
- Go wash with shampoo.

318
00:32:29,745 --> 00:32:31,120
Do I smell?

319
00:32:31,396 --> 00:32:33,291
No… for round two later.

320
00:32:33,316 --> 00:32:34,818
Wow… Round two.

321
00:32:40,508 --> 00:32:42,752
Hey babe, make sure
to take care of the bed.

322
00:32:42,911 --> 00:32:45,821
Don’t let those damn
termites mess it up

323
00:32:46,008 --> 00:32:49,316
or I'll handle them. Okay?

324
00:32:49,979 --> 00:32:51,150
Go take a shower!

325
00:32:55,325 --> 00:32:57,991
- Who’s that bastard?
- Honey!

326
00:32:59,082 --> 00:33:00,211
Forget about it.

327
00:33:00,622 --> 00:33:01,622
Hey!

328
00:33:02,023 --> 00:33:03,192
You bastard!

329
00:33:05,297 --> 00:33:06,611
Damn it!

330
00:33:13,507 --> 00:33:14,754
Who’s that guy?

331
00:33:14,779 --> 00:33:15,819
I don't know!

332
00:33:16,568 --> 00:33:18,427
- Shit!
- Come on, let’s go inside.

333
00:33:18,815 --> 00:33:19,870
Don’t be mad.

334
00:33:29,867 --> 00:33:31,548
Ugh… Money’s
just turned to stone.

335
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:38,433
Oh… Lawin.

336
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,388
I’ll go ahead, still
have a trip to make.

337
00:33:43,075 --> 00:33:44,786
Good luck to you!

338
00:34:02,213 --> 00:34:03,932
How about you, bro?
Just hanging out there?

339
00:34:04,022 --> 00:34:06,181
Dude, it hasn't even
been 30 minutes yet.

340
00:34:42,856 --> 00:34:44,190
Bed for sale!

341
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:54,599
[sighs]

342
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:58,701
Hello Laura!

343
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,766
Seriously, no updates?

344
00:35:00,961 --> 00:35:03,046
Well, I’m still trying to sell it.

345
00:35:03,496 --> 00:35:04,498
Lawin!

346
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:07,444
We need to get the rings!

347
00:35:07,847 --> 00:35:09,725
Yeah, I know… I know!

348
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:11,791
I’m actually working on it.

349
00:35:11,816 --> 00:35:13,011
Just wait for me there.

350
00:35:13,036 --> 00:35:14,865
I’m going to keep my promise to you.

351
00:35:14,964 --> 00:35:16,473
I’ll make it right.

352
00:35:16,498 --> 00:35:18,068
I’ll definitely fulfill my promise.
I'll get it back.

353
00:35:18,092 --> 00:35:19,288
Promises again.

354
00:35:32,082 --> 00:35:33,356
Bed for sale!

355
00:35:51,631 --> 00:35:54,292
Saw it here, saw it there.

356
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:59,314
Measure this, measure that.

357
00:36:36,064 --> 00:36:37,125
Bang it here,

358
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,334
bang it there.

359
00:36:38,398 --> 00:36:40,264
Who’s a whore?

360
00:36:40,463 --> 00:36:42,986
I’m asking you nicely
and that’s how you answer!

361
00:36:43,317 --> 00:36:44,317
Huh?

362
00:36:44,376 --> 00:36:46,088
I’m sorry, Miss.

363
00:36:46,178 --> 00:36:47,364
I wasn’t talking to you.

364
00:36:47,389 --> 00:36:48,574
I was just spaced out.

365
00:36:48,912 --> 00:36:50,792
- Really sorry about that.
- Alright, it’s fine.

366
00:36:50,821 --> 00:36:54,007
Maybe you’re just dizzy
from walking around all day.

367
00:36:54,821 --> 00:36:57,116
So… how much is that again?

368
00:36:57,376 --> 00:36:59,421
Only 2500 pesos.

369
00:36:59,855 --> 00:37:01,232
Come on, Miss, buy it, please?

370
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:02,372
Give me your phone.

371
00:37:02,601 --> 00:37:03,912
But this is not for…

372
00:37:03,937 --> 00:37:06,864
- Give me that! Come on!
- No, miss! Please!

373
00:37:06,889 --> 00:37:07,900
Wow, that’s intense!

374
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:09,844
Take that to this address.

375
00:37:10,022 --> 00:37:11,214
It’s close by.

376
00:37:11,954 --> 00:37:12,954
Bring that bed.

377
00:37:13,071 --> 00:37:14,434
I'm Lauren, by the way.

378
00:37:17,451 --> 00:37:18,451
And I'm Lawin!

379
00:37:33,622 --> 00:37:34,622
Bed for sale!

380
00:37:40,668 --> 00:37:44,335
A day bed rests inside the humble hut.

381
00:37:45,047 --> 00:37:47,849
The hut stands quietly in the fields.

382
00:37:48,578 --> 00:37:51,278
In the countryside, peace lingers.

383
00:38:00,025 --> 00:38:02,579
And life is the sweetest
when it carries no burdens.

384
00:38:25,478 --> 00:38:27,620
Glad you came, it’s solid here.

385
00:38:27,658 --> 00:38:29,407
No one's going home sad tonight!

386
00:38:29,873 --> 00:38:30,980
Cheers! Cheers!

387
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:34,063
You’re getting sexier, huh?

388
00:38:34,874 --> 00:38:41,747
[background chatter]

389
00:38:41,789 --> 00:38:43,920
- Hey! How are you, man?
- Good!

390
00:38:43,945 --> 00:38:46,613
We’ve been waiting for you!

391
00:38:46,638 --> 00:38:47,638
Hello!

392
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,500
What's up?

393
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,203
Take a shot!

394
00:38:52,228 --> 00:38:54,179
We haven’t bonded in a long time.

395
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,564
Drinks?

396
00:38:56,036 --> 00:38:58,316
There’s plenty over there.

397
00:38:58,445 --> 00:39:00,004
- Go ahead and take your pick.
- Nice!

398
00:39:00,036 --> 00:39:03,299
- You know us so well!
- Of course!

399
00:39:03,528 --> 00:39:05,285
- Oops, hold on, bro.
- Sure, man.

400
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:06,704
Excuse me, excuse me.

401
00:39:10,145 --> 00:39:11,145
Hello!

402
00:39:11,778 --> 00:39:13,178
Hello! What?

403
00:39:14,696 --> 00:39:15,696
What bed?

404
00:39:16,703 --> 00:39:18,185
Where are you now?

405
00:39:20,884 --> 00:39:22,720
Okay, fine. Just hurry up!

406
00:39:23,891 --> 00:39:25,368
Alright. Bye!

407
00:39:34,386 --> 00:39:35,849
Shot! Shot!

408
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,590
Cheers!

409
00:39:40,762 --> 00:39:42,362
This is my favorite!

410
00:39:42,784 --> 00:39:44,243
Try this.

411
00:39:45,315 --> 00:39:47,536
It's your turn!

412
00:40:29,327 --> 00:40:30,871

413
00:40:31,078 --> 00:40:32,078

Balut!

423
00:40:57,879 --> 00:40:59,307
You want balut?

424
00:40:59,979 --> 00:41:01,018
Not much left.

425
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,946
What do you say, boss...
You getting some?

426
00:41:05,597 --> 00:41:06,641
Still warm?

427
00:41:07,053 --> 00:41:08,090
Of course, boss!

428
00:41:08,115 --> 00:41:09,300
This is still warm.

429
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:10,679
Want one?

430
00:41:15,584 --> 00:41:16,584
Got a light?

431
00:41:18,487 --> 00:41:20,181
Sheesh, I thought you came to buy,

432
00:41:20,905 --> 00:41:22,383
turns out you just wanted a light.

433
00:41:26,968 --> 00:41:28,528
Sorry, I don’t have any money.

434
00:41:30,729 --> 00:41:33,483
Tell you what, there are only two left.

435
00:41:33,986 --> 00:41:35,266
I’ll just give you a discount...

436
00:41:35,484 --> 00:41:37,051
Buy one, take one.

437
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,180
Deal?

438
00:41:41,657 --> 00:41:44,134
Sorry, I’m broke right now.

439
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:46,656
I gotta run, I’ve got
another place to go.

440
00:41:47,825 --> 00:41:49,745
No, no, here’s the deal instead.

441
00:41:52,035 --> 00:41:53,289
Just take it...

442
00:41:53,964 --> 00:41:55,731
It’s free.
Go ahead, and enjoy it.

443
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:57,338
Just do me a favor,

444
00:41:57,896 --> 00:41:59,528
let me lie down on your
bamboo bed for a bit.

445
00:41:59,552 --> 00:42:00,552
Just for a short while.

446
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,303
The road’s so dirty.

447
00:42:07,991 --> 00:42:09,044
Alright, no problem.

448
00:42:09,924 --> 00:42:11,604
- So that’s mine now?
- Yeah.

449
00:42:11,726 --> 00:42:13,410
Alright, thanks!

450
00:42:20,468 --> 00:42:24,136
Someday, we’ll make it big.

451
00:42:43,462 --> 00:42:46,330
- Let's party!
- [cheering]

452
00:42:46,357 --> 00:42:47,823

- Cheers!
- Cheers!

454
00:42:52,584 --> 00:42:54,182
One more time!

00:43:07,892 --> 00:43:10,585
Get one! Go on!

00:43:11,285 --> 00:43:13,510
[whooping, cheering]

459
00:43:13,637 --> 00:43:16,763
- There we go!
- Bro!

460
00:43:22,128 --> 00:43:24,371
Party!

462
00:43:30,842 --> 00:43:32,315
Cheers! Cheers!

463
00:43:32,993 --> 00:43:35,641
Party! Party!

464
00:43:37,441 --> 00:43:38,525
More!

465
00:43:38,552 --> 00:43:42,688

466
00:43:44,501 --> 00:43:45,501
Party!

467
00:43:51,579 --> 00:43:52,579
Nice!

468
00:43:54,487 --> 00:44:02,233
[whooping, cheering]

469
00:44:03,976 --> 00:44:05,312
Man, you’re something else!

470
00:44:06,281 --> 00:44:08,841
You're supposed to get married,
yet you pawned your wedding ring?

471
00:44:09,556 --> 00:44:10,556
For what...

472
00:44:10,818 --> 00:44:11,945
online gambling?

473
00:44:14,486 --> 00:44:16,798
Go hustle and find the
money to get it back!

474
00:44:17,705 --> 00:44:21,119
If you hadn’t done that,
you’d be home right now,

475
00:44:21,362 --> 00:44:24,797
with your girl making
love the whole day.

476
00:48:09,047 --> 00:48:10,248
Not like this!

477
00:48:10,355 --> 00:48:11,868
Instead of being responsible,

478
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:13,651
you're loitering about,

479
00:48:13,675 --> 00:48:15,425
instead of selling your bed!

480
00:48:16,585 --> 00:48:18,338
That’s what’s wrong
with you kids today...

481
00:48:18,721 --> 00:48:20,058
You just want things
handed to you.

482
00:48:20,082 --> 00:48:21,522
Everything easy, everything instant.

483
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:24,080
Someone gives you a task,
you just sit around waiting.

484
00:48:24,537 --> 00:48:26,682
Get hurt a little, and you
cry like the world’s ending.

485
00:48:26,706 --> 00:48:27,734
Pathetic!

486
00:48:27,759 --> 00:48:29,516
Blah, blah, blah…

487
00:48:31,666 --> 00:48:33,316
What's blah Blah Blah?

488
00:48:34,602 --> 00:48:36,907
I’m not sure either, that’s
just what the script says.

489
00:48:37,676 --> 00:48:38,699
I'll leave you be.

490
00:48:46,025 --> 00:48:47,243
Balut!

491
00:49:39,526 --> 00:49:40,669
How are you doing there?

492
00:49:40,694 --> 00:49:42,266
Let's party!

493
00:49:42,291 --> 00:49:44,604
Damn, I'm jealous!
Keep going!

494
00:49:44,696 --> 00:49:45,828
Wait... Hey!

495
00:49:46,175 --> 00:49:48,176
What took you so long?
Where have you been?

496
00:49:48,201 --> 00:49:49,987
- We’ve been waiting for you…
- Doesn’t matter, you don’t have to know.

497
00:49:50,011 --> 00:49:52,853
- So, where’s the bed?
- What’s with that damn bed anyway?

498
00:49:52,901 --> 00:49:55,284
I have an idea… For a change.

499
00:49:55,309 --> 00:49:57,668
Wow! Okay, okay.
Hey, Joyce!

500
00:49:57,693 --> 00:49:58,879
Lauren.

501
00:49:58,904 --> 00:50:00,379
- Hi!
- Oh yes!

502
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:04,781
Alright, come on! Let's start this!

503
00:52:05,605 --> 00:52:08,045
[cheering]

504
00:52:08,154 --> 00:52:09,673
Party! Party!

505
00:52:09,698 --> 00:52:11,756
- Yeah!
- Woohoo!

506
00:52:11,835 --> 00:52:14,282
- I'm gonna be choosing two, okay?
- Yeah!

507
00:52:14,307 --> 00:52:18,287
Super fun, right?

508
00:52:18,365 --> 00:52:20,617
Hey you, join us here!

509
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:24,282
Stop now, come here, stay here.

510
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:28,561
[cheering]

511
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:29,932
You’re mine.

512
00:52:29,989 --> 00:52:32,115
[cheering, whooping]

513
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:34,972
Keep going! Come on!

514
00:52:34,997 --> 00:52:36,943
Fun, right?

515
00:52:37,207 --> 00:52:38,380
It's so fun!

516
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:41,200
- Yes, go on!
- Yeah! Come here!

517
00:52:41,661 --> 00:52:44,841
- Go!
- Alright, that's enough!

518
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:47,881
Come here to me!

519
00:52:49,707 --> 00:52:51,809
Oh! Our guest is here!

520
00:52:52,109 --> 00:52:56,081
Come over here,
and join us! Come on!

521
00:52:56,105 --> 00:52:58,781
- Come here… Come here…
- He doesn't want to!

522
00:52:58,806 --> 00:53:00,287
Here, maybe he'll say yes to you.

523
00:53:00,312 --> 00:53:02,346
Come on, come on.

524
00:53:03,961 --> 00:53:06,088
There we go!

525
00:53:06,113 --> 00:53:07,713
Go on, approach him!

526
00:53:07,738 --> 00:53:10,163
[cheering, chattering]

527
00:53:10,284 --> 00:53:11,284
Come on!

528
00:53:11,337 --> 00:53:13,967
[cheering, chattering]

529
00:53:13,992 --> 00:53:16,269
Nah, nah, you’re too scared, huh?

530
00:53:16,294 --> 00:53:17,849
- Come here!
- Let's go!

531
00:53:17,916 --> 00:53:20,382
- Boo!
- Lame!

532
00:53:20,453 --> 00:53:24,763
[overlapping chatter]

533
00:53:25,144 --> 00:53:28,689
- Not interested?
- Seems like he isn't!

534
00:53:28,754 --> 00:53:30,048
Alright then, suit yourself.

535
00:53:30,242 --> 00:53:33,542
We'll have fun ourselves!

536
00:55:15,333 --> 00:55:17,330
- Miss!
- What?

537
00:55:20,592 --> 00:55:22,903
- Miss, you gotta pay me.
- Hey! Stop being annoying!

538
00:55:23,409 --> 00:55:26,062
Joyce. Come over here.

539
00:55:26,358 --> 00:55:27,391
Let me borrow this first.

540
00:55:29,414 --> 00:55:30,414
Go to him.

541
00:55:30,677 --> 00:55:32,974
You handle him, okay?

542
00:55:35,553 --> 00:55:37,326
We'll take care of you, man!

543
00:55:40,813 --> 00:55:41,813
Right?

544
00:55:41,891 --> 00:55:43,727
Wait, miss, sorry.

545
00:55:44,088 --> 00:55:46,469
Man, you’re so annoying.

546
00:55:46,493 --> 00:55:47,725
You’ve been going on and on.

547
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:50,347
We said we’ll pay you, okay?

548
00:55:51,105 --> 00:55:52,274
Why won't you stop?

549
00:55:52,581 --> 00:55:54,101
- Hmm?
- Uh, well...

550
00:56:05,721 --> 00:56:08,576
- Hey! Hey!
- Police!

551
00:56:08,621 --> 00:56:10,026
Stop right there, Gen Z!

552
00:56:10,051 --> 00:56:12,002
Nobody try anything funny.

553
00:56:12,189 --> 00:56:15,508
Hey!

554
00:56:15,641 --> 00:56:17,649
- Sir, we didn't do anything wrong!
- Don't move!

555
00:56:17,694 --> 00:56:22,892
[clamoring]

556
00:56:22,916 --> 00:56:26,291
Grab her, grab her!
Where are you going, huh?

557
00:56:26,318 --> 00:56:30,784
[clamoring]

558
00:56:30,809 --> 00:56:32,962
Come here! Where are you going?

559
00:56:32,987 --> 00:56:37,157
Sir, I’m sorry… I’m still studying.

560
00:56:37,211 --> 00:56:39,877
Please don't! My parents can't find out!

561
00:56:39,936 --> 00:56:43,421
Your poor parents… You’re busted.

562
00:56:43,446 --> 00:56:44,480
Get dressed now!

563
00:56:44,544 --> 00:56:45,919
You won’t slip past me.

564
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:47,904
Clothes on! Get dressed!

565
00:56:47,929 --> 00:56:49,364
Hey, hey!

566
00:56:49,389 --> 00:56:52,862
Sir, we’re begging you,
don’t take us in.

567
00:56:52,887 --> 00:56:56,462
- Sir, please!
- I'm begging you!

568
00:56:56,487 --> 00:56:58,502
You Gen Z kids.

569
00:56:59,771 --> 00:57:03,697
Sir, our parents will get mad…

570
00:57:03,758 --> 00:57:05,184
- Sir!
- Wait!

571
00:57:05,249 --> 00:57:10,594
- Sir! Please!
- Please have mercy!

572
00:57:10,691 --> 00:57:12,765
Sir, we didn’t do anything wrong…

573
00:57:12,913 --> 00:57:15,474
Sir, we won't fight back!

574
00:57:15,608 --> 00:57:40,608
[clamoring]

575
00:58:07,493 --> 00:58:09,037
Hold it!

576
00:58:12,673 --> 00:58:13,884
Stop right there!

577
00:58:17,102 --> 00:58:18,896
Hands down!

578
00:58:19,229 --> 00:58:20,229
Sir!

579
00:58:20,593 --> 00:58:22,051
I haven’t done anything wrong.

580
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:26,383
Put your pants... uh, I mean,
put your hands down!

581
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:30,548
- Down!
- Yes, sir!

582
00:58:38,661 --> 00:58:42,431
Damn… here it is.

583
00:58:48,041 --> 00:58:49,792
Today is your lucky day.

584
00:58:52,266 --> 00:58:53,266
Sir?

585
00:59:00,486 --> 00:59:02,864
I know this bed quite well.

586
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:07,663
Me and my babe
used to hang out here.

587
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:11,026
This bed is mine.

588
00:59:12,110 --> 00:59:15,019
We’ve got so many memories here.

589
00:59:17,252 --> 00:59:18,293
Sir?

590
00:59:18,318 --> 00:59:23,595
We make love on this bed.

591
00:59:25,793 --> 00:59:27,273
Does that mean you’ll take it?

592
00:59:27,315 --> 00:59:29,654
This bed is mine now.

593
00:59:29,976 --> 00:59:31,132
It's 2500 pesos, sir!

594
00:59:31,243 --> 00:59:33,451
- I might give you a discount!
- I'm a cop!

595
00:59:34,776 --> 00:59:36,223
Sir, it’s 2500 pesos.

596
00:59:44,287 --> 00:59:45,471
It’s top quality.

597
01:00:00,284 --> 01:00:01,328
Thank you, sir.

598
01:00:04,766 --> 01:00:05,787
I can help you, sir…

599
01:00:05,812 --> 01:00:07,036
No, don't touch.

600
01:00:07,305 --> 01:00:08,445
Do not touch.

601
01:00:10,195 --> 01:00:11,238
Alright, sir, but…

602
01:00:11,263 --> 01:00:12,575
I said do not touch.

603
01:00:22,256 --> 01:00:23,499
Sir, maybe you want my help?

604
01:00:23,524 --> 01:00:24,524
No.

605
01:00:25,078 --> 01:00:26,107
Thanks a lot, sir!

606
01:00:26,131 --> 01:00:27,775
And good luck with the sexy time later.

607
01:00:30,235 --> 01:00:33,448
I'm a cop, and I'm good
at "bang bang".

608
01:00:34,290 --> 01:00:35,417
Nice one!

609
01:02:15,132 --> 01:02:16,426
Oh, you’re here already.

610
01:02:17,696 --> 01:02:19,219
I didn’t wake you up…

611
01:02:20,025 --> 01:02:21,446
You’re really enjoying your sleep.

612
01:02:23,262 --> 01:02:24,542
But look…

613
01:02:27,161 --> 01:02:29,507
The pawnshop’s already closed…

614
01:02:30,443 --> 01:02:32,553
I didn’t get the ring back.

615
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:46,664
Don’t worry about it.

616
01:02:46,688 --> 01:02:50,042
As long as you sold it
and made it home, Lawin.

617
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:56,602
So, what should I do with this?

618
01:02:57,306 --> 01:02:59,072
Put it away for now…

619
01:02:59,127 --> 01:03:01,689
We’ll go get the ring
together tomorrow.

620
01:03:04,962 --> 01:03:05,964
Then?

621
01:03:06,929 --> 01:03:07,929
Of course…

622
01:03:08,991 --> 01:03:10,923
Wait… I’ll hide this for now,

623
01:03:10,948 --> 01:03:12,607
you might end up gambling it again.

624
01:03:12,631 --> 01:03:13,650
Never.

625
01:03:14,292 --> 01:03:15,292
Come here!

626
01:06:00,998 --> 01:06:03,685
"In gambling, you won't win.

627
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:06,398
But in sex, you won't ever lose!"
