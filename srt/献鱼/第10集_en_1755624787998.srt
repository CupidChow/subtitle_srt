1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The wind and the moon are the same.

2
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
But between us, love can be changed.

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Who can love without a wish?

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The heat and the cold will last for the rest of my life.

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Even if this life is endless and I can't live it,

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I will still want to be with you.

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We will never return to this life.

8
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,740
The

9
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,600
Legend of Duanmu

10
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,000
Episode 28

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Why did I just feel something in my body?

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What is he pointing at me for?

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Look at the sun!

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Look at the sun!

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Why did the ancestral moon fly to this place so early?

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Could it be that he is the one who sent the sun to the moon?

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Why did he send the sun to the moon?

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Why did he send the sun to the moon?

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Why did he send the sun to the moon?

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Why did he send the sun to the moon so early?

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Could it be that he is...

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What is this old-age poem or script?

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Shut up.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Did I just say something wrong?

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Si Su, do you have a poison heart skill?

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I don't.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I will test it again then.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Sima Jiao, you are such an old-fashioned man who is crazy for his own good!

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Are you scolding me?

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Come and pick me up.

31
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,400
Yan Jiu.

32
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,880
You and him wait here for me.

33
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,480
Take my order.

34
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,160
Yes.

35
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,240
I'm going to have fun, too.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,840
Okay.

37
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,760
He's so open-minded.

38
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,120
He missed the opportunity

39
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,680
to enjoy the view of the capital.

40
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,680
Yan Jiu has just become a human being.

41
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,520
Let him see what these things are made of.

42
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,920
No wonder you made him.

43
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:09,920
I know.

44
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,080
I'm not surprised.

45
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,600
I didn't expect you to be like this.

46
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,880
I'm here to find someone.

47
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,280
Find someone.

48
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,480
Mr. Tian.

49
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,840
Didn't you just marry the 14th concubine?

50
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,480
Why didn't you stay in the bridal chamber?

51
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,880
You're here to have fun again.

52
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,760
That's right.

53
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,280
I've married her home.

54
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,320
I don't want to marry her.

55
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,000
Mr. Yan, don't be unhappy.

56
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,680
Come on.

57
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,920
The 14th concubine?

58
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,240
This man is so bad.

59
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,920
Look at that man.

60
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,680
I saw him.

61
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,280
But the distance is too far.

62
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,240
He's a little small.

63
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,440
I saw it.

64
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,200
There's a fire mark behind him.

65
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,400
Mr. Tian.

66
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,920
Is he the one you're looking for?

67
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,040
Mr. Tian.

68
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,160
That man is coming up.

69
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,560
Huan Lang.

70
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,560
Why are you here again?

71
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,440
How long are you going to keep me?

72
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,640
Huan Lang.

73
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,200
You said

74
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,080
you only love me in this life.

75
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,520
But now,

76
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,720
why are you here to have fun again?

77
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,720
Guards.

78
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,120
The maid in charge of the flower house.

79
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:37,840
Here they are.

80
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,800
Huan Lang, you...

81
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,920
Take this man away.

82
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,360
Yes.

83
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,400
Huan Lang.

84
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,000
Huan Lang.

85
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,560
Go.

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Go.

87
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,760
I'd rather

88
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,640
kill him

89
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,600
if I exposed him.

90
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,200
You're worried about him.

91
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,680
You're worried about him a lot.

92
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,000
What kind of death is it?

93
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,840
The most painful kind.

94
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,440
It's better to die than live.

95
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,680
Go.

96
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,440
Mr. Yan.

97
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,160
Mr. Yan.

98
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm not attractive at all.

99
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,800
I don't want to touch him at all.

100
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,800
Go.

101
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:16,960
Yes.

102
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,720
Guards.

103
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,560
Guards.

104
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,560
Guards.

105
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,560
Guards.

106
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,560
Guards.

107
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,560
Guards.

108
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,560
Guards.

109
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,560
Guards.

110
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,560
Who are you?

111
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,760
What are you going to do?

112
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,360
Master.

113
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,600
Is there any connection

114
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,720
between the maid and your family?

115
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,520
I'm also curious.

116
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,520
I have a blood-stained feeling for the Purple Man.

117
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,520
Mr. Yan.

118
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,520
Mr. Yan.

119
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,520
Mr. Yan.

120
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,640
They just changed their clothes.

121
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,440
Why did they

122
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,240
recognize you as Mr. Shen Xu?

123
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,640
I just tried a little trick.

124
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,280
Master, you're going to pretend to be someone else

125
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,400
and hit the enemy's internal force.

126
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,800
I thought you were a strong attack player.

127
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,840
I didn't expect you to use the jade-backing tactic.

128
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,840
Not bad.

129
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,240
Mr. Yan.

130
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,840
You look much better.

131
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,840
You're really a good boy.

132
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,840
It hurts.

133
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,440
It hurts.

134
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,440
You can fly if you don't want to.

135
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,440
It hurts.

136
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,840
Stop it.

137
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,440
I really admire your jade-backing tactic.

138
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,240
You're Mr. Yan now.

139
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,440
Don't show your face.

140
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:41,840
Master.

141
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,240
Master.

142
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,440
Mr. Yan.

143
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,640
Mr. Yan.

144
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,840
You still avoid me.

145
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,040
It's our previous promise.

146
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,240
We can't keep it.

147
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,640
This girl is so pitiful.

148
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,240
Why don't you stop hurting her?

149
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,640
What does she have to do with me?

150
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,640
Master.

151
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,840
Remember you're Mr. Yan now.

152
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,240
Tell her

153
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,240
I don't deserve your love.

154
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,040
I don't deserve your love.

155
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,440
I'm a rotten,

156
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,440
dirty,

157
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,440
and a beast.

158
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,240
I'm a rotten,

159
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,240
dirty,

160
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,640
and a beast.

161
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,840
So,

162
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,240
forget me.

163
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,640
Go find Liang Yuan.

164
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,840
Forget me.

165
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,240
Go find Liang Yuan.

166
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,640
Huan.

167
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,440
I can stop looking for you.

168
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,640
I won't bother you anymore.

169
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,240
But can you tell me why?

170
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,040
Why are you so cold all of a sudden?

171
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,640
You treat me like a stranger.

172
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,240
You're silly.

173
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,640
All men are like this.

174
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,840
You're silly.

175
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,640
All men are like this.

176
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,240
Master.

177
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,440
Don't say that.

178
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,240
Huan.

179
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,840
I don't understand what you're talking about.

180
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,440
There are too many people.

181
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,440
Actually,

182
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,640
I have something to tell you.

183
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,840
Our daughter

184
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,040
had an accident last month.

185
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,040
She hasn't got a name yet.

186
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,440
Can you

187
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,040
give her a few names?

188
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,040
It's none of my business.

189
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,240
Soul Wolf.

190
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,840
Where's Nian Jiu?

191
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,240
I sent her a message.

192
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,040
Didn't you say you'd keep her in the water for three months?

193
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,040
The effect of the Magic Elixir

194
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,040
depends on my mood.

195
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,440
I can change it if I want.

196
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,440
I can change her mood.

197
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,040
But you're now dead.

198
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,640
So in front of others,

199
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,040
you'd better be a good girl.

200
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,240
I know.

201
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,640
Soul Wolf.

202
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,280
Go.

203
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,000
It seems

204
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,400
that Mr. Yan is a big scumbag

205
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,280
who is always in trouble.

206
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,680
What do you mean by scumbag?

207
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,640
It's the kind of man

208
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,360
who should be chased into a scum.

209
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,880
Maybe he will.

210
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,440
What will he do?

211
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,120
He will turn into a scum

212
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,880
after he breaks his bones.

213
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,440
I think this ancestors

214
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,920
are going to make a big deal.

215
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,040
Mr. Yan is back.

216
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,920
Mr. Yan is back.

217
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,240
Hurry.

218
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,760
Hurry.

219
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,440
Hurry.

220
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:36,160
He's case is being

221
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,240
discovered.

222
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,200
Miss Yan.

223
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,460
Miss Yan.

224
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,640
Who are you?

225
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,640
Why did you turn into me?

226
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,520
Of course, you're interested in me.

227
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,120
What are you going to do?

228
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,080
Are you going to take me back?

229
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,240
Guards!

230
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,920
Your Highness, have you forgotten?

231
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,040
Master went to the next town to do business.

232
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,440
He'll be back in a month.

233
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,440
Guards!

234
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,880
I got it.

235
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,160
Get lost.

236
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,160
Yes.

237
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,760
Who are you?

238
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,720
You can't fight with the ancestors.

239
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,720
Stop it.

240
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,520
Get lost.

241
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,520
Guards!

242
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,120
What's behind the flame-tiger behind you?

243
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,360
I don't know.

244
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,480
I don't know.

245
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,400
Tell me.

246
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,680
I don't want to go back there.

247
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,000
I don't want them to go there either.

248
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,920
It's so scary.

249
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,440
It's so disgusting.

250
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,640
Master,

251
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,080
it seems that it's PTSD.

252
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,160
What?

253
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,000
It's like it's touched a kind of shadow memory

254
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,560
when it mentioned the tiger.

255
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,080
It's so crazy.

256
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,560
I can't even take it seriously.

257
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,680
Master,

258
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,320
Master asked you to go to the Sixth Concubine's place to rest tonight.

259
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,280
You're not allowed to go anywhere.

260
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,120
You should stay at home and give me a good life.

261
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,920
The Young Master of the Yan family married many wives.

262
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,280
He didn't go to the imperial examination and got a good reputation.

263
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,720
He even drank wine every day.

264
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,800
What's the difference between raising a useless woman?

265
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,960
I think

266
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,600
you're just trying to live a good life.

267
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,680
You don't have to suffer.

268
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,040
He'll be a man of no value

269
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,240
and will be a rich man sooner or later.

270
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,160
You still have nothing.

271
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,800
You can't even use the Soul-searching Skill.

272
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,080
It seems that his shadow memory is quite heavy.

273
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,080
He's just a useless man.

274
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,400
Don't worry.

275
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,560
Let's find some clues from somewhere else.

276
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,200
I'm not afraid.

277
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,840
I'll kill a few people in this mansion.

278
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm not afraid that they won't tell the truth.

279
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,920
Master, you can't do that.

280
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,640
We still have a lot of important news to ask.

281
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,760
And you're wearing this scoundrel's skin.

282
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,360
You have to be cautious.

283
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,000
If you can't bear it, you'll mess up the plan.

284
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,880
Oh my god.

285
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,880
The son of the God-killing God-willing God

286
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,520
has already got a team of footballers.

287
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,120
Childe.

288
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,160
Childe.

289
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,280
It's been a long time since you came to see me.

290
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,080
Childe.

291
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,720
When can I see Xiange?

292
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,880
Since he was born,

293
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,360
I haven't seen him for a few times.

294
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,120
That's right.

295
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,840
Childe.

296
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,680
Childe.

297
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,080
Childe, you came to see me.

298
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,720
Let go of me.

299
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,240
Childe.

300
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,600
Master.

301
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,560
Can you help me change my personality?

302
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,680
I'll go out for a while.

303
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,200
What for?

304
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,160
That Qingniang must not know yet

305
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,760
that Childe Yan has married more than ten concubines.

306
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,560
I have to tell him.

307
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,480
Let him give up.

308
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,040
Don't you always like to be lazy?

309
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,920
Why do you take the initiative to find your master now?

310
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,640
I'm not lazy.

311
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,320
I'm just being lazy.

312
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,040
More importantly,

313
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,040
those concubines have made it difficult for you to find your master.

314
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,000
Qingniang is still entangled.

315
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,160
I have to help my master solve this trouble.

316
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,320
All right.

317
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,480
Then you go.

318
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,920
If Zhou Qing'er has any clues about the flame birthmark,

319
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,600
please report it to me.

320
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,360
This is a wild wild beast.

321
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,080
Got it.

322
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm praising you.

323
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,160
Praising you.

324
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,800
How much is this embroidery?

325
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,680
Five cents.

326
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:39,960
What about the white one?

327
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,960
Let's see the white one.

328
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,080
The white one is also five cents.

329
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,280
The price is the same as the white one.

330
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,120
I think the red one is better.

331
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,040
Thank you.

332
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,280
Qingniang.

333
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:53,880
Qingniang.

334
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,480
Qingniang.

335
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,280
Qingniang.

336
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,040
Qingniang.

337
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,760
Qingniang.

338
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,400
Qingniang.

339
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,240
Qingniang.

340
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,520
Qingniang.

341
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,000
You are

342
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,240
the concubine of the new wife of Huan Lang, right?

343
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,960
I saw you in Huan Lang's sedan chair.

344
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,000
I have nothing to do with Mr. Yan.

345
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,360
I came here because I saw him treat you like that that day.

346
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,440
I feel unworthy of you.

347
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,920
He has already married many concubines.

348
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,800
He just married one two days ago.

349
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,640
Listen to me.

350
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,640
You should give up on that

351
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,280
disloyal and heartless man.

352
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,000
Miss, you don't know that

353
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,800
Huan Lang is not the kind of person you are talking about.

354
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,480
I met Huan Lang for the first time.

355
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,920
We have the same heart.

356
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,840
We have the same wish.

357
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,520
Which one do you like?

358
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,560
Tell me.

359
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,640
Xiao Cui.

360
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,560
How about this one?

361
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,520
So annoying.

362
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,920
The good one is still inside.

363
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,160
Let me tell you.

364
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,000
The press is broke.

365
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,840
Incorrect.

366
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,760
Qingniang.

367
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,760
It's quite small.

368
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,200
Did Huan Lang ask you to give me the money?

369
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,760
No, he...

370
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,360
Just take it as a yes.

371
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,120
Miss,

372
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,680
I don't want to talk about it.

373
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,040
I can stop pestering him.

374
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,280
But if he can't explain the reason to me,

375
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,560
I will never leave him.

376
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,520
Miss,

377
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,000
please wake up.

378
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,360
Huan Lang once wrote a poem to me.

379
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,040
It's about love and light.

380
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,960
Love is not expensive.

381
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,720
At that time,

382
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,760
he would spend the night with me

383
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,920
near Fanzhou.

384
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,840
I don't believe it.

385
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,080
I don't believe that everything is for no reason.

386
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,200
It will become like this.

387
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,440
No.

388
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,440
Don't cry.

389
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,240
Qingyang,

390
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,640
I have another question.

391
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,960
You know that

392
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,280
there is a fire-shaped birthmark behind the salt ring, right?

393
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,560
I know it.

394
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,640
Did he tell you about the birthmark?

395
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,320
I never heard of it.

396
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,760
Alright.

397
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,520
But the birthmark is really a secret.

398
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,640
Don't cry.

399
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,560
You look like you are in a bad shape.

400
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,720
I asked Qingyang.

401
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,720
He only knows that there is a fire-shaped birthmark on the salt ring.

402
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,600
But he doesn't know what it represents.

403
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,480
We can only find another clue.

404
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,440
And Qingyang is so obsessed with love.

405
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,480
No matter how I try to persuade him,

406
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,200
he won't believe that the salt ring is for him.

407
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,160
What is love?

408
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:56,200
It's a disease that can't be cured except love.

409
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,800
It's a disease that can't be cured except love.

410
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,280
So you have the disease or not?

411
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,560
Me?

412
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,240
Of course not.

413
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,120
I can't even take care of myself.

414
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,880
That's good.

415
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,280
Love is the most useless thing in the world.

416
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,160
Love is a very powerful thing.

417
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,400
Only a person with such a bad cultivation

418
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,360
can have such a thought.

419
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,480
It's normal for the ancestors to grow up in such an environment.

420
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,240
It's normal for them to not believe in love.

421
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,280
Don't you want to rest?

422
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,760
I don't want to rest.

423
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,000
Although the water tower is fierce,

424
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,800
it's not necessary to appear frequently.

425
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,720
Grandmaster,

426
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,840
I want to go out for shopping tomorrow.

427
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,680
Can you help me change into a human?

428
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,080
You talk too much.

429
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,680
Go to bed.

430
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,720
Grandmaster,

431
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,160
I'm begging you.

432
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,360
Don't sleep.

433
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,360
Grandmaster.

434
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,040
Again?

435
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,280
Buy a newspaper, Grandmaster.

436
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,680
It's not much money.

437
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,920
I already have five newspapers.

438
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,400
I'll buy it when I go back.

439
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,640
The silver bug that can locate the soul

440
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,360
and guide me to the last trace of the wine

441
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,040
is the Yan Mansion.

442
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,320
I think Sima Jiao and Ting Yan are also here.

443
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,880
Let's go to the street.

444
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,280
Shuling.

445
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,080
Miss,

446
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,600
may I ask if there is a girl who has entered the mansion recently?

447
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,600
Are you talking about the concubine of Mr. Yan?

448
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,600
Concubine?

449
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,960
No.

450
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,960
The girl I'm looking for

451
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,960
is about this tall,

452
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,480
very thin,

453
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,040
and very beautiful.

454
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,200
Lu Ling came to find me?

455
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,320
I haven't seen her.

456
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,040
Thank you.

457
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,840
Lu Ling.

458
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,120
Ru Ling.

459
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,400
Where are you from?

460
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,400
Don't delay my business.

461
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,560
Lu Ling, wait for me.

462
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,880
The last trace of the wine

463
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,400
is clearly here.

464
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,560
Could it be...

465
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,840
Could it be that Ting Yan has already...

466
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,200
You little demon.

467
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,200
Why are you here again?

468
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,120
What does this mean?

469
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,280
I'm Ting Yan.

470
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,760
Ting Yan?

471
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,600
Ting Yan?

472
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
Ting Yan?

473
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,600
How is that possible?

474
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,680
At the star-gazing platform,

475
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,760
Ting Yan invited me to eat fruit

476
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,200
and watch the scenery.

477
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,880
Are you really Ting Yan?

478
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,800
Ting Yan.

479
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,200
It's really not easy, sister.

480
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,200
I understand.

481
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,200
The Grand Master wanted to use this method to protect you

482
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,680
so that you can avoid the difficulties of the eight great masters.

483
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,120
But seeing you in the star-gazing platform

484
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,320
really scared me.

485
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,880
You're my best friend.

486
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,480
Lu Ling.

487
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,280
Lu Ling, it's really you.

488
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,800
Why are you here?

489
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,520
I came here

490
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,120
to find Ting Yan.

491
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,920
I happened to meet her.

492
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,120
You found Ting Yan?

493
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,920
Where is she?

494
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,200
I don't know.

495
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,200
I don't know.

496
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,200
Don't worry.

497
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,600
She's fine now.

498
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,600
That's good.

499
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,600
It seems that she and you are really close.

500
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,800
Grand Master.

501
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,800
My name is Liao Ting Yan.

502
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,800
I keep this secret from everyone.

503
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,000
She's quite happy about you.

504
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I'm so happy.

505
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I'm so happy.

506
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I'm so happy.

507
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I'm so happy.

508
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I'm so happy.

509
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I'm so happy.

510
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I'm so happy.

511
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,600
Grand Master, please forgive me.

512
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,600
I'm really worried about Ting Yan's safety.

513
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I've been looking for her.

514
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,400
Ting Yan can't bear to see me sad.

515
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,400
That's why I told you.

516
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,000
If you tell me where she is,

517
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Grand Master, don't worry.

518
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I will keep my mouth shut.

519
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Grand Master.

520
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,400
Lu Ling.

521
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
You all know where Ting Yan is.

522
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,000
Why didn't you tell me?

523
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,000
I didn't want to hide it from you.

524
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,600
Why don't you find your own problem first?

525
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,600
Well...

526
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,600
My own problem?

527
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,600
By the way, Lu Ling.

528
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,600
We'll meet again this time.

529
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Can you take the class officially?

530
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,200
Take the class?

531
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,600
Have you forgotten?

532
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,600
You promised to teach me how to be a person.

533
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,200
I haven't forgotten.

534
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,600
Then the first class...

535
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,600
You are a person with a bad temper.

536
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,600
Although you have a bad temper,

537
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,600
you will be unprotected by others.

538
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,600
Even you will be obedient unconditionally.

539
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,600
You are too sincere and kind.

540
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,600
You will suffer losses.

541
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,600
Then what should I do?

542
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,600
Lu Ling.

543
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,600
Teach me.

544
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,600
Miss.

545
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,600
Good-looking long-sleeved shirt.

546
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,600
Take a look.

547
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,600
Which one do you like?

548
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,600
Take a look.

549
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,600
You have good taste.

550
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,600
This is a good-looking long-sleeved shirt.

551
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,600
How much?

552
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
Only 110.

553
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,600
110?

554
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,600
Yes.

555
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,600
Wait.

556
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,600
I can see your long-sleeved shirt.

557
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,600
It was bought in a large batch in Nanshan.

558
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,600
At most, 10 taels.

559
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,600
10 taels?

560
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,600
Miss.

561
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,600
10 taels.

562
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,600
You should buy this.

563
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,600
This is 10 taels.

564
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,600
Okay?

565
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,600
It's 10 taels.

566
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,600
No.

567
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,600
10 taels is a loss.

568
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,600
No.

569
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,600
10 taels is yours.

570
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,600
Yours.

571
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,600
Here.

572
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,600
Master.

573
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,600
Take this as a thank-you gift.

574
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,600
I remember that the Shao can be heard for a hundred miles.

575
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,600
If I call you with my life,

576
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,600
you can hear my Shao in the distance.

577
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,600
Okay.

578
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,600
If you need it,

579
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,600
I can be with you anytime.

580
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,600
Thank you, Nianjiao.

581
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,600
Look.

582
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,600
People are complicated.

583
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,600
There are traps everywhere.

584
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,600
If you meet the situation of buying Shao again,

585
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,600
you can't just agree like just now.

586
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,600
Do you understand?

587
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,600
Then how should I refuse them?

588
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,600
Let me teach you.

589
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,600
You can say it's not good to refuse them later.

590
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,600
It's not good.

591
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,600
If they keep asking you,

592
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,600
just say I'm not convenient.

593
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,600
I'm not convenient.

594
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,600
If they insist on you to do it,

595
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,600
you can just be straightforward

596
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,600
and clearly refuse them.

597
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,600
Or you can say no.

598
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,600
I understand.

599
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,600
I understand.

600
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,600
It's the same as the word roll in poetry, right?

601
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,600
Yes.

602
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,600
But that should be the most top-notch refusal.

603
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,600
It's not good.

604
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,600
I'm not convenient.

605
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,600
Or no.

606
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,600
Roll.

607
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,600
I've learned it.

608
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,600
I didn't teach you the last one.

609
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,600
It's not good.

610
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,600
Or no.

611
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,600
I'm not convenient.

612
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,600
Good for you, you scoundrel.

613
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,600
You didn't even tell Qingniang,

614
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,600
and now you're here to teach Zhou Yueqing.

615
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,600
Let's see how I teach you.

616
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,600
Yueqing.

617
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,600
Yueqing.

618
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,600
Yueqing.

619
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,600
Yueqing.

620
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,600
Yueqing.

621
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,600
Wait.

622
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,600
Our daughter was born last month.

623
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,600
She's poor. She doesn't have a name yet.

624
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,600
Can you give her a name?

625
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,600
Huan Lang once wrote a poem to Zeng Huo.

626
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,600
Jin and Mingyue

627
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,600
are not home since the Qingfeng.

628
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,600
Mingyue, Qingfeng, Zhou...

629
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,600
My god. Is this name...

630
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,600
Yueqing.

631
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,600
Master.

632
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,600
I think I found something.

633
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,600
What is it?

634
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,600
Yan Huan.

635
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,600
He really likes Qingniang.

636
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,600
You came to me in a hurry

637
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,600
to tell me about Yan Huan's story.

638
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,600
I just saw him

639
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,600
give her a name.

640
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,600
Even if he really likes her,

641
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,600
so what?

642
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,600
Master.

643
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,600
Think about it.

644
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,600
Yan Huan is a man of good looks and good character.

645
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,600
Since he likes her,

646
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,600
he can marry her.

647
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,600
Why does he want to

648
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,600
get close to her?

649
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,600
I think Yan Huan's pain

650
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,600
is related to the fire-bombed birthmark.

651
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,600
Master.

652
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,600
Master.

653
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
Master.

654
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,600
It's the second aunt. She's having a stroke.

655
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,600
What?

656
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,600
Luckily.

657
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,600
Luckily, she was saved.

658
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,600
Take me to see her.

659
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,600
Master.

660
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,600
It's here.

661
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,600
My god.

662
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,600
Master.

663
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,600
Master.

664
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,600
Please let me see my god.

665
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,600
Master.

666
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,600
If I didn't miss my son,

667
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,600
I wouldn't have forced him to death.

668
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,600
I would have forced him to death.

669
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,600
Master.

670
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,600
I'm begging you.

671
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,600
I'm begging you.

672
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,600
I'm begging you.

673
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,600
Let me see him.

674
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,600
Master.

675
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,600
I miss my son too.

676
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,600
Master.

677
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,600
Where's the baby?

678
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,600
I don't know.

679
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,600
You and Master

680
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,600
never allow us

681
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,600
to talk about the baby.

682
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,600
It sounds like

683
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,600
Master Yan also has a problem.

684
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,600
Right, Ancestor.

685
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,600
We've all neglected one thing.

686
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,600
The concubine of Yan's house.

687
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,600
But there's no baby in the whole house.

688
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,600
I'm begging you.

689
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,600
There's also a child

690
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,600
of Yan's family.

691
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,600
The bride?

692
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,600
I saw the bride

693
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,600
here last time.

694
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,600
She said her house is nearby.

695
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,600
Huan Lang.

696
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,600
Huan Lang.

697
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,600
Concubine.

698
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,600
What's wrong?

699
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,600
Our baby was stolen.

700
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,600
When?

701
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,600
Just now.

702
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,600
Just now.

703
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,600
The baby and I were playing in the yard.

704
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,600
I wanted to get a baby's skull

705
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,600
in the bedroom.

706
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,600
When I got back to the yard,

707
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,600
the baby was gone.

708
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,600
What should we do?

709
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,600
I'll go find it.

710
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,600
But there are people all over the street.

711
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,600
We don't know where the bastard went.

712
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,600
How to find it?

713
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,600
Follow the light.

714
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,600
We should be able to find

715
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,600
the bottom of the sea.

716
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,600
This way.

717
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,600
It's you.

718
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,600
Bring the baby back.

719
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,600
Get out of my way.

720
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,600
Move.

721
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,600
Baby.

722
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,600
Baby.

723
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,600
Childe.

724
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,600
You're really a great person.

725
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,600
Why did you steal the baby?

726
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,600
Do you know that

727
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,600
we're not allowed to steal the baby.

728
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,600
It's a death sentence.

729
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,600
Why did you steal the baby?

730
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,600
I want to take the baby back to the mansion.

731
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,600
When Master Yan comes back,

732
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,600
I'll give it to him.

733
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,600
You're from the Yan Mansion.

734
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,600
What about after giving it to Master Yan?

735
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,600
I don't know.

736
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,600
Master only asked me to pay attention

737
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,600
to whether the child was left outside.

738
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,600
If there's anything,

739
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,600
I'll take it back to the mansion.

740
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,600
I just met Zhou Qing'er.

741
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,600
I don't know anything else.

742
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,600
Where is Master Yan?

743
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,600
He said he was going to the next city to do something.

744
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,600
No one knows where he is.

745
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,600
It's true.

746
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,600
The baby also has a fire-burning birthmark.

747
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,600
Does it mean that

748
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,600
Master Yan will give birth to a baby

749
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,600
with a fire-burning birthmark?

750
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,600
The Yan family took the baby

751
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,600
for some purpose

752
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,600
and took it away.

753
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,600
It's because these babies

754
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,600
are very useful.

755
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,600
The Yan family gave Yan Huan

756
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,600
so many concubines

757
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,600
to force him to pass on.

758
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,600
Why does this operation sound so...

759
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,600
Isn't it the same as Master Yinsi's operation?

760
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,600
In order to feed the spirit fire,

761
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,600
it's like combining the ancestors' parents.

762
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,600
First, it's like combining the ancestors' parents.

763
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,600
Then it's like applying the ancestors' blood.

764
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,600
The people of the Xian family are really boring.

765
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,600
They all have the same birthmark.

766
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,600
No suspicion.

767
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,600
The baby! My baby!

768
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,600
Thank you, Miss.

769
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,600
Thank you, Young Master.

770
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,600
Who... who took my baby away?

771
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,600
Is it the maid?

772
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,600
The people of the Yan family.

773
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,600
The people of the Yan family?

774
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,600
Why... why is that?

775
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,600
My sister is pregnant.

776
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,600
Why is that?

777
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,600
Because of the baby.

778
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,600
The baby is not a child.

779
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,600
The baby is a child.

780
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,600
Why?

781
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,600
We don't know.

782
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,600
Qiniang,

783
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,600
I asked you about the baby last time.

784
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,600
Why didn't you tell me

785
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,600
that your daughter also has a baby?

786
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,600
Do you know about the baby?

787
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,600
I really don't know.

788
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,600
I didn't mean to hide it.

789
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,600
Huan...

790
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,600
I asked Huan about the baby's birthmark.

791
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,600
But he was so anxious.

792
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,600
It seemed that the baby was a miscarriage.

793
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,600
Then I gave birth to a daughter.

794
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,600
She also had the same birthmark.

795
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,600
I knew Huan didn't like it.

796
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,600
So I pretended not to know

797
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,600
when you came to ask.

798
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,600
It seems that only Master Yan

799
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,600
and Master Yan's daughter

800
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,600
can know the truth.

801
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,600
Master,

802
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,600
tell her

803
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,600
that your daughter's name is Yue Qing.

804
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,600
Me?

805
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,600
Mother is here.

806
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,600
I named my daughter

807
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,600
Yue Qing.

808
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,600
I named my daughter

809
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,600
Yue Qing.

810
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,600
Zhou Yue Qing.

811
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,600
Yue Qing?

812
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,600
The love letter and the moon

813
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,600
are not returned.

814
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,600
Huan wrote this

815
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,600
as a gift for me.

816
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,600
I guess

817
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,600
he still misses me.

818
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,600
Yue Qing,

819
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,600
this is the name your father gave you.

820
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,600
Do you like it?

821
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,600
Do you like it?

822
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,600
E'er,

823
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,600
give our baby

824
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,600
a name.

825
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,600
Call him Jiao'er.

826
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,600
Well...

827
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,600
What if

828
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,600
he has a name?

829
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,600
Even if he has a name,

830
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,600
he will be a disaster

831
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,600
for us.

832
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,600
Master,

833
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,600
don't scare me.

834
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,600
I'll take care of him.

835
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,600
No matter what kind of ancestors

836
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,600
Yue Qing has,

837
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,600
he has his mother in the world.

838
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,600
I will never let him

839
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,600
be alone in the world.

840
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,600
Young Master, Miss,

841
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,600
although I don't know

842
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,600
your real identities,

843
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,600
I'd like to thank you.

844
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,600
Can you tell that he is not Yan Hua?

845
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,600
Can you break my spell?

846
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,600
I don't know any spell.

847
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,600
I just

848
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,600
got used to his every move

849
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,600
when I was with Huan Lang.

850
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,600
At first,

851
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,600
I didn't dare to deny it.

852
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,600
Now,

853
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,600
I have more time to get along with him.

854
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,600
Besides,

855
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,600
you were looking for someone

856
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,600
with a magic trick.

857
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,600
I can confirm that

858
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,600
he is not Yan Hua.

859
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,600
Master,

860
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,600
can true love break magic?

861
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,600
Let him use true love

862
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,600
to break Yan Hua's fate.

863
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,600
He is a knife.

864
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,600
We will continue to investigate

865
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,600
the Yan family.

866
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,600
Thank you, Miss.

867
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,600
Thank you, Miss.

868
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,600
Thank you, Miss.

869
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,600
Thank you, Young Master.

870
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,600
Master,

871
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,600
so

872
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,600
does the Yan family

873
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,600
really have any relationship with you?

874
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,600
Otherwise, why did you

875
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,600
have such a relationship?

876
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,600
Otherwise, why did you

877
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,600
have such a relationship?

878
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,600
Yes.

879
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,600
I have noticed that

880
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,600
the flame birthmark

881
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,600
is related to the Fengshan Clan.

882
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,600
When I first entered the city,

883
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,600
I found Yan Hua

884
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,600
with the blood of the bloodline.

885
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,600
For more than 500 years,

886
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,600
Sima is only one person.

887
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,600
I don't know

888
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,600
there is a power of

889
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,600
bloodline between the bloodline.

890
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,600
So just now,

891
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,600
I used the bloodline to detect the child.

892
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,600
But

893
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,600
why is there

894
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,600
the bloodline of the Fengshan Clan?

895
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,600
The Fengshan Clan

896
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,600
has always promoted pure bloodline translation.

897
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,600
But after so many years,

898
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,600
it is inevitable that someone will not listen to the advice of the elders

899
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,600
and leave the descendants of the non-tong clan.

900
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,600
Shi Qian Lv

901
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,600
has been working so hard

902
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,600
to find the Fengshan bloodline.

903
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,600
It's a big deal in the next round.

904
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,600
Use the pen to draw the color of light

905
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,600
to warm your cold soul.

906
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,600
Memories stop,

907
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,600
yearning is clear,

908
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,600
but unable to be touched.

909
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:59,600
Searching for the pulse in the sand,

910
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,600
the flower is still not fire.

911
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:09,600
Burn all the fireflies.

912
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,600
If you are alone,

913
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,600
you will not be alone.

914
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,600
The rules of heaven are all in a whirlwind.

915
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,600
What about life and death?

916
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,600
If you are alone,

917
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,600
you will not be alone.

918
00:43:34,600 --> 00:44:00,280
The result is lost in the
