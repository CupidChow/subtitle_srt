song title

3
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,700
 ♫ Heavens strike with thunderous wrath ♫ 

4
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,520
 ♫ Mountains and rivers shatter before my eyes ♫ 

5
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,680
 ♫ Endless splendor
cultivated through lifetimes ♫ 

6
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,490
 ♫ Turns to dust between my fingers
in an instant ♫ 

7
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,180
 ♫ When the line
between good and evil is clear ♫ 

8
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,240
 ♫ Countless souls drift
into the boundless wilds ♫ 

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,700
 ♫ Carrying the spirit fire forward ♫ 

10
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,780
♫  I defy fate just to remain by your side  ♫

11
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,840
 ♫ Falling into love's abyss ♫ 

12
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,660
 ♫ Like heavy rain pouring down ♫ 

13
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:08,560
 ♫ Drunk on romance ♫ 

14
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,300
 ♫ In a blink, love and hate
vanish into illusion ♫ 

15
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,240
 ♫ Falling into endless love ♫ 

16
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,440
 ♫ Stirring waves upending a lifetime ♫ 

17
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,660
 ♫ Even if this life leads to ruin ♫ 

18
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:27,020
 ♫ I still choose to be entangled with you ♫ 

19
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,125
 ♫ Through all lifetimes ♫ 

20
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:36,620
 

21
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,800
 

22
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,750
There's no time to dwell on it.

23
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:46,390
While he's wounded by the array,
we capture him.

24
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:49,750
Remember this. Leave him alive.

25
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,880
Shi Qian Lv.

26
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,550
Shi Qian Lv, you spent centuries scheming

27
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,040
and went to such lengths
to build Baifeng Mountain,

28
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,990
all so you could seize control
of Gengchen Celestial Palace

29
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,850
and no longer be restrained by the Sima clan.

30
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,990
Now, everything is about to fall apart
when you're this close to success.

31
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,130
Does that please you?

32
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:31,810
Sect Master Shi. Was Baifeng Mountain really your doing?

33
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:36,180
Don't listen to him! He's slandering me!

34
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,990
Sima Jiao, I thought
you still had a shred of conscience, so I defended you at every turn.

35
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,830
But you treat human lives like nothing.

36
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,200
Don't blame us for no longer protecting you!

37
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,430
- Everyone, don't be misled by him!
- That's right.

38
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,320
He just wants to drag
Gengchen Celestial Palace down with him.

39
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,740
If he manages to kill
the Spirit Fire completely, that will be the real disaster.

40
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,200
You want my life?

41
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,080
Keep dreaming.

42
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,930
The likes of you aren't capable
of bringing me down.

43
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,230
Shi Qian Lv, so you've really reached
the Grand Ascend realm.

44
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:31,610
No wonder you've been pushing
your secret plans at Baifeng Mountain.

45
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,100
Let me guess.

46
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:39,000
You must have hidden
another Spirit Fire somewhere,

47
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,480
planning to use my clan's secret to achieve your goal.

48
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,080
Another Spirit Fire?

49
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,320
Sima Jiao, stop spouting lies!

50
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,280
If I die here with everyone on the mountain and leave you no trace of Fengshan blood,

51
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,430
then your grand dream will be over.

52
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:19,440
 ♫ All beings are but fleeting mayflies,
deceived ♫ 

53
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,740
 ♫ Only with both love and hate
can one fight relentlessly ♫ 

54
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:31,040
 ♫ To forge the boundless Great Way
as its creator ♫ 

55
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,180
 ♫ Rewrite the starry tides of time ♫ 

56
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,570
 ♫ Dye the moon and sky in crimson light ♫ 

57
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:40,170
He wants to throw his life away and take us down with him!

58
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,450
Stop him together!

59
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,460
It's useless.

60
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,020
 ♫ Transform our parting's elegy ♫ 

61
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:53,680
 ♫ Strength bows to nature's law alone ♫ 

62
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,840
 ♫ So what if we perish? ♫ 

63
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,320
Sima Jiao, you...

64
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,860
He really does look like he's at his limit.

65
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,520
His body is about to give out.

66
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,610
Are you afraid?

67
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:18,660
The ones who should be afraid
are those people over there.

68
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,960
Sima Jiao, if it hurts too much, just stop.

69
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,240
If you're going to die anyway, there's no point in dragging out your suffering for their sake.

70
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,350
Looks like I'll be dying here today.

71
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:42,880
But I've already had such a long holiday, so I guess I can't complain.

72
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,100
 ♫ To save you, to save me ♫ 

73
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:52,233
 My destiny is to live a carefree life, eating, drinking, and having fun. 

74
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,930
 Grandmaster. Does this mean I don't have to
be buried with you? 

75
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,020
 You don't want to die? 

76
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,450
 Of course not. 

77
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,860
 I have nothing left in this world
worth clinging to. 

78
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,910
 But she... She still wants to live. 

79
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,670
She still wants to live.

80
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,910
Forget it.

81
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,810
Forget what?

82
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:27,350
 ♫ For the healing of wounds ♫ 

83
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,440
What is he doing now?

84
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,540
 ♫ To protect the vastness ♫ 

85
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:38,220
 ♫ For you, for me ♫ 

86
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,380
 ♫ For the light of dawn ♫ 

87
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:52,140
 ♫ I'll face promises like a moth to a flame ♫ 

88
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,590
Grandmaster, let's go.

89
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,840
- Come on.
- All right.

90
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,940
Grandmaster?

91
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,560
Go, now.

92
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,520
You can't walk anymore?

93
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,270
I can't. Run on your own.

94
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,180
Hold on a little longer.

95
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,440
Get up.

96
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,030
Don't you know how to run away?

97
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,660
Come on, Grandmaster.
Just hold on a little longer.

98
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,230
You want to take me with you?

99
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,670
Yes.

100
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,280
Are you trying to die?

101
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,320
No.

102
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,470
If you drag me along, you'll die for sure.

103
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,440
You're not that foolish, are you?

104
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,330
This isn't foolish.

105
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,470
You've saved me so many times.

106
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,230
Pull yourself together.

107
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:47,980
Tell me where it's safer to run.

108
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,010
Just go.

109
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,080
Grandmaster?

110
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,560
S-Sima Jiao!

111
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,280
Sima Jiao!

112
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,980
Wake up!

113
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,850
Sima Jiao!

114
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,720
 What's on his leg? 

115
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,040
Why is it glowing?

116
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,204
 

117
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,510
Where is this?

118
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,200
Why does it feel like
I've stepped into someone else's domain?

119
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,550
Since fate has brought you here,

120
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,150
don't be in such a hurry to leave.

121
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,112
 

122
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:15,460
Young man, it looks like you still remember me.

123
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:19,820
So... It really is you.

124
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:29,980
Are you here to kill me or to save me?

125
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:34,620
Either is possible.

126
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,990
But before that, there is a question that must be answered.

127
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:42,140
And what if I have no patience to answer you?

128
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,490
This is not a question for you to answer.

129
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,660
Nian Jiu.

130
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,400
You're awake.

131
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,950
Here.

132
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,560
How do you feel?

133
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,340
Ru Ling, why am I here?

134
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,530
Where is the Grandmaster?

135
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,440
How is he now?

136
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,710
The Shi family noticed your movements
and attacked you.

137
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:36,750
I rescued you when no one was watching and secretly brought you back here.

138
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,700
As for the Grandmaster, don't worry.

139
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,810
The Shi family and the other palaces
failed to subdue him.

140
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:47,320
But he and Ting Yan are currently missing.

141
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,780
Missing?

142
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,110
Then I must find him right away.

143
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,320
Wait.

144
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,160
If you rush out now,
you'll only make things worse.

145
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,000
Sit down.

146
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,880
The Shi family and the other palaces are searching everywhere for the Grandmaster.

147
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,590
If you go now,
you'll draw attention to yourself,

148
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:09,630
and you may end up injured again,
just like this time.

149
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,750
But the Grandmaster...

150
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,830
Don't worry.

151
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:16,950
If he and Ting Yan managed to escape, I'm sure they'll be fine.

152
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,960
Listen, I can move around more freely than you.

153
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,440
I'll go out and see how the search went.

154
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,630
You stay here and wait for me.

155
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:49,940
Centuries of my clan's work,
all ruined by that brat!

156
00:12:53,590 --> 00:13:00,200
Once I complete my great plan,
I'll flay him alive and tear out his tendons!

157
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:06,780
Sect Master, we've searched
the surrounding area, but there's no sign of Sima Jiao.

158
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,250
He was already gravely injured.

159
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,400
In such a short time, how could he just vanish?

160
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,410
Keep searching!

161
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,400
Bring him back to me,
even if you have to dig deep into the ground!

162
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,940
Understood.

163
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:31,000
Father, what should we do next?

164
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,960
Sima Jiao was badly wounded in the siege.

165
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:40,320
With his condition, even if he hides for a few days,
it won't help him.

166
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,960
Now that my plan is exposed and Baifeng Mountain is destroyed,

167
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:51,300
our only option
is to take advantage of his injuries and seal him away again.

168
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:55,030
But with Baifeng Mountain exposed, I fear the Eight Palaces may...

169
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:59,440
They are too busy hunting Sima Jiao right now to think about that!

170
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:02,920
Zhen Xu, clean this place up.

171
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,400
Don't leave a single witness alive.

172
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,840
Yes, Father.

173
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,560
You're a demonic cultivator, aren't you?

174
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,890
Me, a demonic cultivator?

175
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:38,030
 If the Sect Master or the other palace heads learn your true identity, 

176
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,680
 do you think Sima Jiao will still protect you? 

177
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:46,150
Well, even though I'm a demonic cultivator, I don't think I've ever harmed anyone.

178
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,230
Don't be nervous, Miss.

179
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,050
I know.

180
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:58,600
My eyes can tell good from evil, so I know you are not one of the wicked.

181
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,630
Thank goodness.

182
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,920
You scared me.

183
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,860
I thought you were going to take my life.

184
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:09,160
Many years ago, I met Sima Jiao once at Three Saints Mountain.

185
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,200
He was still very young then,

186
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,870
yet he already showed extraordinary intelligence and insight.

187
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,920
I gave him the Taoist name "Mercy"

188
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,200
in hopes that he would
have compassion for living beings

189
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,990
and restrain his urge to kill.

190
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,860
I foresaw

191
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,010
that he would single-handedly
destroy Gengchen Celestial Palace,

192
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:37,710
nearly overturn the entire cultivation world, and slaughter countless innocent mortals.

193
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,350
Fertile lands would be scorched barren.

194
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:48,470
The Immortal Realm would become hell.

195
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,630
The world would fall into devastation.

196
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,260
And he would commit terrible sins.

197
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,970
The Grandmaster may look ruthless, but he doesn't kill indiscriminately.

198
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,590
Nothing in this world is absolute.

199
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:12,040
Even in a dead end,
there may be a thread of hope.

200
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:17,640
In his blood-soaked, murderous future, I caught sight of a faint glimmer of life.

201
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:22,070
So, I foretold that he would one day
encounter a turning point,

202
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:25,130
a person who would change him.

203
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:27,290
Who is that person?

204
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,980
Back then, I left a prayer bead on him

205
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,930
to suppress his viciousness and help keep his mind clear.

206
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:41,180
But at the same time,
if he gave in to killing intent,

207
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,930
he would be overcome by unbearable pain.

208
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,470
So, this bead isn't just an ornament.

209
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:59,940
This prayer bead is seen by others
only as a seal that binds him.

210
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,130
From the day it was put on,
no one has been able to remove it.

211
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:07,210
But in truth, it is also a divine medicine.

212
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:11,410
If you can undo this seal, the bead can save his life once.

213
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:17,080
If not, it means Sima Jiao never found that spark of hope,

214
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:21,300
and today will be his end.

215
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,000
Can't you just save him yourself?

216
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,310
Why don't you try?

217
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,470
I thought so.

218
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:13,200
Since you are Sima Jiao's one chance at life,

219
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,110
you are also the hope of all living beings.

220
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,840
I ask that you guide Sima Jiao from now on.

221
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,960
Lead him toward the good.

222
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,360
There are other Spirit Fires in the world.

223
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,250
Tell him to handle them with care and use them for righteous deeds.

224
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,960
Other Spirit Fires?

225
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,510
What do you mean?

226
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,640
Pass the message to Sima Jiao.

227
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,970
He will understand.

228
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,920
But look at him now.

229
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,360
He's gravely injured.

230
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,260
No number of bandages would be enough.

231
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,960
Master...

232
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:54,610
Master?

233
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:58,200
My connection with the Fengshan Clan ends here.

234
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,710
Take care.

235
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,150
You're leaving just like that?

236
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:15,680
This bead was taken off your ankle,

237
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,350
but surely you wouldn't mind, right?

238
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,340
 His complexion looks better than before. 

239
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,720
Finally, I've managed to save you for once.

 ♫ Mountains and rivers shatter before my eyes ♫ 

241

You have the face of a delicate, pretty boy,

00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:17,110
yet you endured it all without ever once crying out in pain.

Please wake up.

255
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:51,460
 ♫ Through all lifetimes ♫ 

256
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,510
The new Spirit Fire has already taken shape.

257
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:11,230
I originally planned to use
the Fengshan clansmen on Baifeng Mountain

258
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:16,560
to complete my grand plan, but he has ruined everything!

259
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:22,920
He will repay what he destroyed with his own blood!

260
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,360
Don't worry, Father.

261
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,200
Even if we cannot find Sima Jiao here,

262
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,170
the Eight Palaces have spies everywhere in the Celestial Palace.

263
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:33,340
He may hide for a while,
but he cannot hide forever.

264
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,250
Exactly.

265
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,440
My people are everywhere.

266
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:49,160
Father, why don't I return now

267
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,480
to investigate the movements
of the Eight Palaces for you?

268
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:03,200
At a time like this, you are still caught up in romance?

269
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,580
I apologize, Father.

270
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:11,230
But I have never asked you for anything.

271
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,120
My only wish is to be with An Xue.

272
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,680
I beg you, Father, let us be together.

273
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,660
Zhen Xu.

274
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,090
I don't want to go against your wish,

275
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:34,305
but Sima Jiao found An Xue while you were away

276
00:22:34,305 --> 00:22:36,870
and killed her in the cruelest way!

277
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:40,270
I couldn't do anything.

278
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:45,190
And for fear of exposing myself, I couldn't even recover her body.

279
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,230
What?

280
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:53,680
No... impossible.

281
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,510
That's impossible.

282
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:58,960
An Xue was always so cautious.

283
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,090
This can't be. How could this happen?

284
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,480
No...

285
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,940
Sima Jiao...

286
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:09,680
I will kill Sima Jiao to avenge An Xue!

287
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,450
 Zhen Xu. 

288
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:17,690
 When do you plan
to perform Soul Cleanse on An Xue? 

289
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,400
 Remember this. 

290
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,960
 Apart from me, no one
is truly trustworthy in this world. 

291
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,560
 In our great undertaking, there must not be the slightest flaw. 

292
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,530
Father.

293
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:44,960
Father.

294
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,840
I have always revered you.

295
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,920
I've worked hard since childhood.

296
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:52,680
You know the only one I ever loved was An Xue.

297
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,820
You know how much I loved her.

298
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,150
What are you implying?

299
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,600
Why are you saying this to me?

300
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,550
You are my son.

301
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,600
Of course I know you better than anyone else.

302
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,120
What is it?

303
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,640
Do you think I am lying to you?

304
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,710
No.

305
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,360
No.

306
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,580
I would never think that.

307
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,390
Good.

308
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,960
Get up.

309
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:25,580
Zhen Xu, from now on,

310
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,820
don't let yourself be entangled in love again.

311
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:32,160
Our top priority now is to capture Sima Jiao

312
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:38,880
so we can complete our plan
and attain immortality.

313
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,860
Yes.

314
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:46,980
When we achieve our goal, I will kill Sima Jiao to avenge An Xue!

315
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,400
You're still sleeping?

316
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,760
He's about to die!

317
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,030
I just gave him a life-saving pill.

318
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,440
His Soul Manor is a complete mess.

319
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,190
He tried to die together with his enemies and nearly burned up his very soul.

320
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:14,020
His body may be recovering now, but his consciousness is fading away.

321
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,400
What does that mean?

322
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,620
It means he'll die!

323
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:22,020
So, that master's medicine can heal his body, but not his soul?

324
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:26,410
Go inside his Soul Manor and piece his soul back together.

325
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:28,360
Hurry!

326
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,190
Go!

327
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:33,710
Didn't you always say
you wanted to kill Sima Jiao?

328
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:35,990
Why are you suddenly so concerned?

329
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,790
You think I want to save him?

330
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:40,160
I still haven't figured out
how to separate from him.

331
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,440
If he dies now, I die with him.

332
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,360
So, hurry up and save him!

333
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,880
Easy for you to say.

334
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,400
Sima Jiao is at such a high realm.

335
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,350
If he doesn't open up his Soul Manor, how am I supposed to get in?

336
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,230
Just try.

337
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,880
He's crazy about you, isn't he?

338
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,690
Maybe you can get in.

339
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:58,440
What makes you think that?

340
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,840
How could I not know how he feels?

341
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,600
Stop wasting time.

342
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,920
Get in already!

343
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:09,120
If you don't act fast,
once his consciousness fades completely, he'll really be gone!

344
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,840
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

345
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,440
How do I get into his Soul Manor?

346
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,350
Press your forehead to his.

347
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,110
Do it!

348
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:51,860
So, this is Sima Jiao's Soul Manor?

349
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:14,350
Nothing?

350
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:20,510
Is his soul too damaged to even fight back?

351
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,510
Grandmaster, I'm here to save you.

352
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,690
Open the door, please.

353
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,340
Grandmaster?

354
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,790
Sima Jiao?

355
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,680
Jiao?

356
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:03,310
That was easy.

357
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:33,160
His Soul Manor is like a mountain of flames.

358
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,550
If I had to suffer like this all the time,

359
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:39,580
I'd go insane, too.

360
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:04,040
 He will live forever in the agony of the Spirit Fire's burning. 

361
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,920
 I don't want him to live such a life. 

362
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,820
 Better to end the Fengshan Clan's
generations of tragedy here. 

363
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:13,030
 Jiao was born with this mission. 

364
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:16,510
 If you act recklessly, you might die! 

365
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:18,290
 Sima Jiao! 

366
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:26,170
 Why do these soul fragments even carry emotions with them? 

367
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,230
 Sima Jiao, are you really this miserable? 

368
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:32,120
 I took you eating, drinking, and having fun. 

369
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,040
 Hasn't that cheered you up at all? 

370
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,080
No...

371
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,920
No...

372
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,400
This is the soul core.

373
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:05,860
If it scatters,
he'll be completely annihilated.

374
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,070
No, stop.

375
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,990
Please stop.

376
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:12,620
No!

377
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,640
No...

378
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,460
How do I hold it together?

379
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:21,100
 ♫ No fate's tangle, no parting swans ♫ 

380
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,880

400

Sima Jiao.

401
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:13,720
Am I going to die in your Soul Manor?

402
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:17,160
I'm already starting to forget who I am,

403
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:23,290
yet I can still clearly feel all the emotions you've ever experienced.

404
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:30,900
 ♫ I would never regret the day I met you ♫ 

405
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,100
I told you,

406
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:37,590
if I don't want you to die, you won't die.

407

 ♫ Even if my very soul were to vanish ♫ 

408

 ♫ Mad love blooms a lotus in the heart ♫ 

413
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:14,580
 ♫ Mad love blooms a lotus in the heart ♫ 

414
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,050
I...

415
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,310
He won't kill me when he wakes up, will he?

416
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,920
I told you you could do it.

417
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,200
His condition is much more stable now.

418
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,510
A few more tries and he'll be fine.

419
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:41,010
A few more tries?

420
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,100
That one nearly killed me already.

421
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,880
I thought barging in like that would have damaged your soul,

422
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,610
but it seems not only are you fine, but you also came out with benefits.

423
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:54,350
Shut up, you little brat!

424
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:12,030
 He's crazy about you, isn't he? 

425
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:14,380
 Maybe you can get in. 

426
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,070
 Grandmaster, I'm here to save you. 

427
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,110
 Open the door, please. 

428
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:25,620
 Then why don't you tell me
what you really think? 

429
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:28,050
 I want to hear the truth. 

430
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:29,660
 I'm doing this 

431
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,040
 because I cherish you so much 

432
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:39,380
 that I don't want you
to be harmed in the slightest. 

433
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:45,940
Maybe he really does like me a little bit.

434
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:51,360
No... I'm getting ahead of myself.

435
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,960
One of life's biggest illusions is thinking, "He must like me."

436
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,560
Nine times out of ten,
it's just wishful thinking.

437
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,860
Calm down...

438
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:03,070
He's at least 500 years old.

439
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:05,870
How could he possibly have feelings for me?

440
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:11,620
Even if I'm into him, he won't care.

441
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:16,610
 You, a lowly cultivator
at the Foundation Rise realm, think I like you? 

442
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:19,400
 How laughable. 

443
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,760
 Thinking about romance day and night? 

444
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,940
 No wonder the people from your world never make progress in cultivation. 

445
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:35,440
But I can't just give up halfway, right?

446
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,570
Wouldn't that be a waste of effort?

447
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,550
All right, I'll see this through to the end.

448
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:15,570
 Liao Ting Yan's Soul Manor
is so peaceful and pleasant. 

449
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:02,300
I don't think I've ever really looked closely at your face.

450
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,440
Most of my memory of your face

451
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:10,420
is still stuck on the day we first met.

452
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,190
Back then, the disciple beside me collapsed,

453
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:19,760
her blood splattering onto my dress and hands.

454
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,450
I immediately broke out in a cold sweat.

455
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:27,410
Later on, as I saw you fight
against more and more people.

456
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:31,960
I gradually learned about your painful past.

457
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,090
 The pain I've endured will be repaid. 

458
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:36,710
 Every bit of it. 

459
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:44,780
 Grandmaster, so we've broken the seals, right? 

460
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,280
 Correct. 

461
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,450
But my fear of you actually grew weaker.

462
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,230
Now, I'm not afraid of you at all.

463
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:03,570
Even though I think you'll lash out at me
when you wake up,

464
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:07,700
to be honest, I don't feel nervous at all.

465
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:21,030
You have such plump earlobes.

466
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:24,300
Why didn't that make you a man of good fortune?

467
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,260
You're awake.

468
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:01,720
It's hard to explain this to you right now.

469
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:06,290
 That stupid flame said it would take at least three rounds of merging
before he could wake up. 

470
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:07,270
 But it's only been two! 

471
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:09,220
 Can't it do basic math? 

472
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,260
I think...

473
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:14,300
I just had a very good sleep.

474
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,870
Maybe I had something to do with that.

475
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,110
The wounds on your chest are almost healed.

476
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,900
That pill really worked like a charm.

477
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,720
The best medicine

478
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,450
isn't the pill.

479
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,740
 What... 

480
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:45,040
 What on earth is going on with Sima Jiao? 

481
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:50,860
 ♫ The tale of fate keeps winding on ♫ 

482
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:57,560
 ♫ I'm unafraid though memories are gone ♫ 

483
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:04,380
 ♫ Through karma's journey,
all lifetimes share one gaze ♫ 

484
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:10,680
 ♫ I believe in each life
we'll fall in love again ♫ 

485
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:15,020
 ♫ Through every trial we've endured ♫ 

486
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:18,380
 ♫ No matter who has sought the cure ♫ 

487
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:24,500
 ♫ Love is the thread that mends the scar ♫ 

488
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:28,780
 ♫ For you, my tears still burn like fire ♫ 

489
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:32,160
 ♫ Destiny leads where my heart belongs ♫

song title

493
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,240
 ♫ Autumn winds sigh ♫ 

494
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,160
 ♫ Moon and stars dapple the sky ♫ 

495
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,200
 ♫ Brushing the loneliness of bygone days ♫ 

496
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,160
 ♫ Candlelight flickers low ♫ 

497
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,200
 ♫ Shadows sway ♫ 

498
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,300
 ♫ Shimmering in the night ♫ 

499
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,240
 ♫ With a brush I draw ♫ 

500
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,200
 ♫ The color of light ♫ 

501
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:36,200
 ♫ To warm your frozen soul ♫ 

502
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,140
 ♫ Memories anchor here ♫ 

503
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,200
 ♫ Longing is engraved ♫ 

504
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,600
 ♫ Yet cannot be touched ♫ 

505
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,920
 ♫ Following ♫ 

506
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,220
 ♫ The veins of gravel ♫ 

507
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:51,570
 ♫ I turn into spirit fire ♫ 

508
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,020
 ♫ Burning away ♫ 

509
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:59,060
 ♫ All these karmic ties ♫ 

510
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,400
 ♫ To save you ♫ 

511
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,340
 ♫ To save me ♫ 

512
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:08,220
 ♫ To cross over all suffering,
I'll break through ♫ 

513
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,300
 ♫ The laws of heaven ♫ 

514
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,260
 ♫ The vortex of reincarnation ♫ 

515
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:16,320
 ♫ What of life and death? ♫ 

516
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,320
 ♫ To save you ♫ 

517
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,280
 ♫ To save me ♫ 

518
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:24,160
 ♫ To redeem all beings, I'll let pass ♫ 

519
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,200
 ♫ Right and wrong ♫ 

520
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,280
 ♫ Rumors and tales ♫ 

521
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,880
 ♫ To seize fate ♫ 

522
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:35,600
 ♫ With my own hands ♫ 

523
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,400
 ♫ For you ♫ 

524
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,300
 ♫ For me ♫ 

525
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:44,140
 ♫ For the healing of wounds ♫ 

526
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,240
 ♫ I'll stir the murky seas ♫ 

527
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,300
 ♫ And strive against the heavens ♫ 

528
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:52,280
 ♫ To protect the vastness ♫ 

529
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,300
 ♫ For you ♫ 

530
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,280
 ♫ For me ♫

00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:00,220
 ♫ For the light of dawn ♫ 

532
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,300
 ♫ I'll face promises ♫ 

533
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,280
 ♫ Like a moth to a flame ♫ 

534
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:10,110
 ♫ And use my body to shine ♫ 

535
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:16,080
 ♫ On even more ♫
