1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Like the heavy rain, I'll be your sword in the sky

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The wind and the moon are the same

3
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But love can be changed

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Who loves me is not fated

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The time is hot and cold

6
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Even if this life is endless

7
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I still want to be with you

8
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I will never change my love for you

9
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Good, good, good

10
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The original body of the City Leader of Dong City is a black snake

11
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Do you think he is so powerful in human form?

12
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I think you're thinking about cultivation again

13
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Don't let anyone hear

14
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The leader of the city is a little white face

15
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's pretty handsome

16
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's decided

17
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Who belongs to you and who belongs to me

18
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Black snake

19
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
This black snake is really powerful

20
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
In a short time

21
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm about to take this Demon Citadel City

22
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That's possible

23
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
After all, behind the leader of the east city

24
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's the old master of Xianfu, Sima Jiao

25
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
He is Sima Jiao

26
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Don't call the name of the ancestral Daoist army

27
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Good, good, good

28
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I thought it was a good day

29
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I didn't expect you to be a roadside boy

30
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
This Sima Jiao should not be a soft-faced

31
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
A two-meter tall demon king

32
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Why does it look like a little white face?

33
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Great, great, great

34
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Brother

35
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Qian Du

36
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
How did you become like this?

37
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's all that Sima Jiao

38
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Let me now

39
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm so sorry

40
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You

41
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You come all the way

42
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm sure you've been through a lot of hardships

43
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I've been avoiding the arrest of the demon

44
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I heard on the way

45
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Sima Jiao has already entered Hexian City

46
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Come so fast

47
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Sima Jiao

48
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Combined with the new spirit fire

49
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Stronger than that year

50
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
He killed a lot of our family members on the way

51
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I believe it will be found soon

52
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Qian Du

53
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Qian Du

54
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
No matter how strong Sima Jiao is

55
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Now

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
He can't beat us

57
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
We can only rely on his magic

58
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Brother said

59
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Liao Tingyan

60
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Correct

61
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Liao Tingyan

62
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That Liao Tingyan

63
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Can actually control

64
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Sima Jiao's power of fire

65
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The extreme cold

66
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
That's right

67
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
After I took him to the Demon Citadel

68
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Give him

69
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
He

70
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
He used the Soul-worshipping spell

71
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I went to his base

72
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So he can use it for me

73
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
No wonder

74
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Eighteen years ago you didn't kill him

75
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Instead, you brought him to the Demon Citadel

76
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Then why

77
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
He stayed with Sima Jiao for a long time

78
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But his cold body

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Didn't affect the power of Sima Jiao

80
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
A little bit

81
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
He seems to have forgotten how to move the body of extreme cold

82
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
This is why I always wash his water

83
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Just to stimulate his extreme cold

84
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Kill Sima Jiao

85
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Dad, I'm back

86
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You're back, Yan

87
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
There are guests at home

88
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Then you talk to the aunt

89
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I forgot to buy vinegar

90
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Come, let me introduce

91
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
My sister, your aunt

92
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I have loved you since I was a child

93
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
She came to see you on purpose

94
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I almost thought I was a ragged old man

95
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's the second spring

96
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Really?

97
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Come

98
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I watched you grow up

99
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yes, I remember

100
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Aunt, you came just right

101
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
What I'm going to prepare tonight

102
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Are all the special dishes of Hexian City

103
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You can try it

104
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
No need

105
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Our family's great grudge has not been paid off for a day

106
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
How can I rest in peace

107
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Dad

108
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Have you heard

109
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Sima Jiao took over Hexian City

110
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
That's right

111
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
But this is not a bad thing

112
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
This is a good opportunity for you to do it

113
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
He is such a devil

114
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm just going to die

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Don't worry

116
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It won't

117
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Your aunt came

118
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Just to help me wash your water

119
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
As soon as possible to stimulate your body of extreme cold

120
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Your action will be successful

121
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I have to wash again

122
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yes

123
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's really a bad thing

124
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Who can die

125
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I can't die in Sima Jiao's hands

126
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I can't revenge for him

127
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Brother

128
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You have tried your best

129
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Although we didn't stimulate his body of extreme cold

130
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
But you have improved a lot

131
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
In addition, Sima Jiao has feelings for him

132
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
No defense

133
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I believe he will succeed

134
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm going to die

135
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm going to die

136
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm going to die

137
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I believe he will succeed

138
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm not afraid he can't kill

139
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm afraid he can't kill

140
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Then

141
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
With this dream spell

142
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I hope he can make up his mind to revenge

143
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What are you doing this early in the morning

144
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Dad

145
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I dreamed of my brother last night

146
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm angry

147
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I can't wait to find Sima Jiao now

148
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Kill Zhier

149
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Kill Zhier

150
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I finally did my best

151
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Dad

152
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I have a lot of power now

153
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm afraid it will hurt you

154
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Can you let me go out

155
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm so scared

156
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Go

157
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Don't make trouble outside

158
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Come back early

159
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I know

160
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It seems that I was fooled

161
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
The nightmare last night was also my father's

162
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
He was full of heart and eyes

163
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Only revenge left

164
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Mother

165
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
This runway

166
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Didn't it say badly

167
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Why is more beautiful than before

168
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
This weapon can resist the harm caused to everyone

169
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I can't hurt him.

170
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,720
Ping Yan.

171
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,640
Ping Yan.

172
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:16,960
Ping Yan.

173
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,280
Master.

174
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,040
Master of Hexian City

175
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,560
wants to host a banquet for us.

176
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,240
Are you going or not?

177
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,280
No.

178
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,160
Then I'll stay here with Master.

179
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,400
Don't bother me here.

180
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:46,960
Master.

181
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,600
Don't worry.

182
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,360
We made such a big fuss

183
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,920
when we attacked Hexian City.

184
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,480
I've exposed my true identity.

185
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,800
I believe

186
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,240
you'll come to me soon.

187
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,280
But I'm not good at waiting.

188
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,760
I'm the best at holding back.

189
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,760
Hexian City

190
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,440
He wants to take my father

191
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,800
to Gu Yuwu to hide from the storm.

192
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,200
Don't move.

193
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,360
I can see that Chang Shao is everywhere.

194
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,760
Why do you care so much about him?

195
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,720
I don't know either.

196
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,040
I just think he's important to me.

197
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,200
What matters to me now

198
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,440
is to save enough money

199
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,880
and take my father to Gu Yuwu.

200
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,880
How about this?

201
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,920
I'll pay the rest.

202
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,200
I'll give you all my savings.

203
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,640
It should be enough.

204
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,400
Then we'll leave together.

205
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,200
Don't you want to

206
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,480
restore your cultivation?

207
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,440
Why do you want to leave too?

208
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Orange Tfortress

209
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,360
Here in this place

210
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,040
I wanted to preserve myself

211
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,200
and develop another resonant.

212
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:20,780
If not for my

213
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,760
I wouldn't stay here.

214
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,440
If you give me the money,

215
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,320
no one will stop me

216
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,400
to leave Yan's Terrace.

217
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,320
Fine.

218
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,240
I'll persuade my father

219
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,280
to pay you back in the future.

220
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,640
You're not going to pay me back

221
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,680
for saying that?

222
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:42,840
Come on.

223
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,560
Good wine.

224
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,720
Come on, guys.

225
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,720
Fill it up. Fill it up.

226
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,600
To the City.

227
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,280
Cheers.

228
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:49,880
Lord Chengzhu, come on.

229
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,360
Come on.

230
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,320
Let's drink together.

231
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,360
Lord Chengzhu.

232
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,680
Congratulations.

233
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,240
You're a good actor.

234
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,240
Come on.

235
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,960
Cheers.

236
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,040
Come on.

237
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,960
Come on.

238
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,360
Come on.

239
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,040
Lord Chengzhu,

240
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,600
let me give you another toast.

241
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,120
I'm here.

242
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,120
You're here.

243
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,320
Let's have a toast together.

244
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:09,960
Cheers.

245
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,640
Together.

246
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,960
Great.

247
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,160
Cheers, Lord Chengzhu.

248
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,720
Lord Chengzhu, cheers.

249
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,960
Lord Chengzhu,

250
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,240
this is the most beautiful street dance here.

251
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,320
Great.

252
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,160
Great.

253
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,040
Great.

254
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,000
Great.

255
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,840
Great.

256
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,800
Great.

257
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:54,880
Come on.

258
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,760
Let's have another toast.

259
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,080
Come on.

260
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,080
Shuling.

261
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,440
I miss you so much.

262
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,320
Eating ice saved my life.

263
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,760
I'm so full.

264
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,600
Enjoy your meal, Lord Chengzhu.

265
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,360
Lord Chengzhu.

266
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,440
Lord Chengzhu.

267
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,000
Go and get a good defining 52許盈酒,

268
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,280
I'll fill it up for you.

269
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,320
Here.

270
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,880
You're a good drinker.

271
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,800
Have another cup.

272
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:08,640
Father.

273
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,240
I have something to discuss with you.

274
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,680
What is it?

275
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,960
I plan to take you to the Gu Yu House right away.

276
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,200
I'm almost ready for the concert.

277
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,440
You can rest in peace when you arrive.

278
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,920
Then, will you give up

279
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,280
the great plan of revenge in our family?

280
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,640
You often say that the Sima Sect is cruel and despicable.

281
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,600
You always think about revenge for your dead brother.

282
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,200
Do you also think about your living daughter?

283
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,680
Why do you make it difficult for me to do that impossible thing?

284
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,000
Here.

285
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,200
Here.

286
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,920
You're so stubborn.

287
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,960
Have you forgotten

288
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,160
who killed your brother?

289
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,760
Who made me like this?

290
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,560
Who ruined our family?

291
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,840
I've been waiting for you for so long.

292
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,280
You told me that I was making things difficult for you.

293
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,080
You've disappointed me.

294
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,080
Father.

295
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,640
I'm heading for our future.

296
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,200
Father.

297
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,320
Please come with me.

298
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,240
We'll take care of the revenge

299
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,720
slowly.

300
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,360
Shut up!

301
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,200
If the Sima Sect doesn't die,

302
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,720
we won't have a future.

303
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,200
Father.

304
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,920
Don't talk nonsense.

305
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,960
If you don't want to persuade me,

306
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,800
you might as well reflect on yourself.

307
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,280
Father.

308
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:51,960
Something happened.

309
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,480
What happened?

310
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,960
My carrot...

311
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,040
I've packed the stuff up.

312
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,120
Let's go.

313
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,280
Yan.

314
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,280
Yan.

315
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,240
How about this?

316
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,760
I'll pay the rest.

317
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,040
I'll give you all my savings.

318
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,480
It's not a big deal.

319
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,560
Then we'll leave together.

320
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,000
Hey.

321
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,560
If I die here one day,

322
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,240
can you collect my body?

323
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,720
I don't want to be sold to the practitioners

324
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,840
when I have no body.

325
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,560
I wonder what they'll train me into.

326
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,320
Okay.

327
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,360
What's your name?

328
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,120
Call me Yan.

329
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,440
When I save enough money,

330
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,880
I'll take you and my father

331
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,400
to Gu Yuwu

332
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,480
to enjoy our lives.

333
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,720
Gu Yuwu?

334
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,560
That's a legendary place.

335
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,440
I've never heard of anyone going there.

336
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,360
Although I don't know where I come from

337
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,360
and who my parents are,

338
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,640
I'm content to have a friend like you.

339
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,080
I don't know who you are.

340
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,680
It's so nice to have you.

341
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,880
Thank you, Yan.

342
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,800
That's right.

343
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,520
Hu Yanfan

344
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,640
didn't break his promise, right?

345
00:21:46,640 --> 00:22:06,260
The

346
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,720
Good day, My Lord.

347
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,480
Live well.

348
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,640
It's good.

349
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,760
Try it.

350
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,560
Here.

351
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,560
Drink some water.

352
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,240
It's good.

353
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,640
You're a good man.

354
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,560
If you want to drink, play some games.

355
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,240
We have to go back to the Eastern City.

356
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:57,960
Okay.

357
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,720
Let's go.

358
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,600
Okay.

359
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,720
Let's go.

360
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,560
Come on.

361
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,680
When we're back to the Eastern City,

362
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,040
we'll have a good time.

363
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,040
Brother,

364
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,200
the dance last night

365
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,360
was nothing special.

366
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,000
Right.

367
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,200
If he didn't resist,

368
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,600
he would have been killed.

369
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,480
I thought he was a cruel character

370
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,480
and he would attack us.

371
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,520
He's a little brat.

372
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,400
Tell me.

373
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,320
Why did you attack us?

374
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,800
Because you killed

375
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,000
someone you shouldn't have.

376
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,840
Oh.

377
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,320
You're the old friend of Wu Ji.

378
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,440
You're here to avenge him.

379
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,120
He's almost my only child.

380
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,040
If you take him away,

381
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,960
I'll pay you with my life.

382
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,040
You're so stubborn.

383
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,720
Mother,

384
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,440
implicitly.

385
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,680
You're under house arrest.

386
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,320
Mother.

387
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,240
You...

388
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,880
Father.

389
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,000
How do you feel

390
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,720
after losing Jin Yu?

391
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,920
I'll kill you.

392
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,120
You!

393
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,360
You...

394
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:58,100
The

395
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:58,660
Okay.

396
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,060
Let's go.

397
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,620
It's a nightmare again.

398
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:27,780
Lord.

399
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,100
When you're in danger,

400
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,380
you should stop me

401
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,820
and be happy.

402
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,060
Yes.

403
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,580
I forgot to go last night.

404
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,700
You smell like blood.

405
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,580
Who dares to attack my brother?

406
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,820
Second doncnir?

407
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,900
Toy spirit.

408
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,980
He is going to play remarkable games with me.

409
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,500
What's this sound?

410
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,020
I've traveled too far

411
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,300
to hear anyальные sound.

412
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,220
Yuan.

413
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,300
It's you.

414
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,620
Let me go.

415
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,180
Let me go.

416
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,340
Master.

417
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,020
Let me go.

418
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,260
Master.

419
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,460
Look.

420
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,740
I brought someone here.

421
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,460
That backầnه.

422
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,180
Death.

423
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,020
It's notAs I've been silentin the whole worldthat

424
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,020
The city is a sky

425
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,020
Let love be forgotten

426
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,020
Old city

427
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:40,020
Unable to resist

428
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,020
Parting from the south

429
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,020
He

430
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,020
Why is he crying

431
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:50,020
The city is a sky

432
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,020
Let love be forgotten

433
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,020
The city is a sky

434
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,020
Unable to resist

435
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,020
Parting from the south

436
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,020
He

437
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,020
Why is he crying

438
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,020
The city is a sky

439
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,020
Let love be forgotten

440
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,020
The city is a sky

441

Parting from the south

He

444
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,020
Why is he crying

445
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,020
The city is a sky

446
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,020
Let love be forgotten

447
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,020
The city is a sky

448
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,020

He

451
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,020
Why is he crying

452
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,020
The city is a sky

453
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,020
Unable to resist

454
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,020
Parting from the south

455
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,020
He

456
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,020
Why is he crying

457
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,020
The city is a sky

458
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,020
Unable to resist

459
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,020
Parting from the south

460
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,020
He

461
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,020
Why is he crying

462
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:20,020
The city is a sky

463
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,020
Unable to resist

464
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,020
The city is a sky

465
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,020
Unable to resist

466
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,020
Parting from the south

467
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,020
He

468
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,020
Why is he crying

469
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,020
The city is a sky

470
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,020
Unable to resist

471
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,020
Parting from the south

472
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,020
He

473
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,020
Why is he crying

474
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,020
The city is a sky

475
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,020
Unable to resist

476
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,020
Parting from the south

477
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,020
He

478
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,020
Why is he crying

479
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,020
The city is a sky

480
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,020
Unable to resist

481
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,020
Parting from the south

482
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,020
He

483
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,020
Why is he crying

484
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,020
The city is a sky

485
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,020
Unable to resist

486
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,020
Parting from the south

487
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,020
He

488
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,020
Why is he crying

489
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,020
The city is a sky

490
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,020
Unable to resist

491
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,020
Parting from the south

492
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,020
He

493
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,020
Why is he crying

494
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,020
The city is a sky

495
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,020
Unable to resist

496
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,020
Parting from the south

497
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,020
He

498
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,020
Why is he crying

499
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,020
The city is a sky

500
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,020
Unable to resist

501
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,020
Parting from the south

502
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,020
He

503
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,020
Why is he crying

504
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:08,020
The city is a sky

505
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,020
Unable to resist

506
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:14,020
Why does Grace still have the ability to use the real flower puff?

507
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,020
You actually don't remember anything

508
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,020
This must be Shi Qianliu's handkerchief

509
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,020
Tell me where he is

510
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,020
Don't try to force me to betray him

511
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,020
Listen

512
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,020
Your name is Liao Tingyan

513
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,020
You are my principle

514
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,020
It has nothing to do with that master

515
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,020
Shi Qianliu apparently called you his father

516
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,020
Does he deserve it?

517
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,020
He just wants to use you to deal with me

518
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,020
Do you understand?

519
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,020
Principle

520
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,020
Are you sure you are not a enemy?

521
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,020
I am sorry

522
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,020
I was too impatient

523
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,020
I will not force you again

524
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,020
I am sorry

525
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,020
I am sorry

526
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,020
I am sorry

527
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,020
I am sorry

528
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,020
I am sorry

529
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,020
I am sorry

530
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,020
Why is he so gentle to me?

531
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,020
It doesn't matter

532
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,020
We still have a lot of time

533
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,020
The situation is a bit wrong

534
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,020
I have to observe first

535
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,020
Where is it?

536
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,020
You wild woman

537
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,020
You killed my brother

538
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,020
And you attacked the master

539
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,020
I will kill you

540
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,020
Give me my brother

541
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,020
Give me my brother

542
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,020
This is the family business of our soul-seeking clan

543
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:01,020
This year

544
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,020
Our soul-seeking clan

545
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,020
Established this eastern city

546
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:07,020
Although this city is now

547
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,020
Your territory

548
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,020
But the dead are our people

549
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,020
Is our family business

550
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:15,020
So the one who killed my people

551
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,020
Should be handed over to our soul-seeking clan

552
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,020
To be punished

553
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,020
Burn it up

554
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,020
Burn it up

555
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,020
That's not a coincidence

556
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,020
This is also the family business of our city's master

557
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,020
Otherwise, follow the rules of your demon jade

558
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,020
Whoever is good, listen to whoever

559
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,020
How about it?

560
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,020
I can't let you go

561
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,020
I can't let you go

562
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:41,020
I can't let you go

563
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,020
I can't let you go

564
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,020
You killed someone

565
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,020
So what if I kill

566
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:55,020
If you didn't attack

567
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,020
With your Jueying's cultivation

568
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,020
You can't kill my brother

569
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,020
Jingcong repeatedly destroyed Jueying

570
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:04,020
Did that hurt

571
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,020
It's the mother of the ancestral city

572
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,020
Does he protect me too much

573
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,020
This enemy

574
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,020
Why are you killing

575
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,020
My good sister died in the hands of those two

576
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,020
I want to revenge for her

577
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,020
I once forced you to kill a bunch of people

578
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,620
I killed a bunch of people before.

579
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,540
You cried and had nightmares.

580
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,060
Now,

581
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,300
we are being harmed by the time.

582
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,340
How can we live

583
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:43,980
if we don't kill people?

584
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,460
I promised you

585
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,620
I wouldn't force you to kill people again.

586
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,580
I don't need you to kill people again.

587
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,700
I won't break my promise.

588
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,620
For the past few days,

589
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,140
I'll deal with those who are causing trouble outside for you.

590
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,180
You don't have to do it.

591
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,420
The one who is guilty has the responsibility.

592
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,300
Those two scoundrels are dead.

593
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,300
But their clan is innocent.

594
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:29,860
I'm sorry.

595
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,380
But I can feel

596
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,500
the anger in your heart

597
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,460
is not dissipated.

598
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,100
If you just want to kill

599
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,820
those two dead people,

600
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,540
I can revive them

601
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,860
and let them die again.

602
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,340
If you can revive them,

603
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,100
can you revive Hong Luo too?

604
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,940
If you want,

605
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,620
you can.

606
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:25,100
But you don't have a friend anymore.

607
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,400
I can only use the skill of

608
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,180
reviving the soul to let her reborn.

609
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,500
Reborn?

610
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,460
So it's not resurrection.

611
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,140
It's reincarnation?

612
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,260
It's different.

613
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,220
The skill of reviving the soul

614
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,340
can let you see her as soon as possible.

615
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,660
And after she was born,

616
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,500
she can have the memories and feelings of the past.

617
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,220
The previous death

618
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,540
is like a dream.

619
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:54,660
Great.

620
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,780
I can see Hong Luo now.

621
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,220
Is Hong Luo

622
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:12,900
so important to you?

623
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:18,020
She is my best friend in the Demon Citadel.

624
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,860
She has been the only one

625
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,460
who has been sincere to me these years.

626
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,280
The Great ROD Alliance

627
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,540
cheered Mi Ka clear up the dark horse.

628
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:33,780
Thank you.

629
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,940
I Pain afterward.

630
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,660
If you don't mind,

631
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:54,900
We've already reached the tone of cups.

632
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,220
Your Highness,

633
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,260
why does Master

634
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:09,900
still mistook him

635
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,060
for a stranger?

636
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:11,980
A stranger?

637
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,100
He's not a stranger.

638
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,580
He's just my best friend.

639
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,860
He even

640
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,540
is this Okong's wife.

641
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:20,740
I...

642
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,260
Thank you for welcoming us.

643
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,060
Greetings, master.

644
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,380
Please punish the one who killed our group

645
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,060
with our soul通,

646
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,900
no matter what happens.

647
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,780
What about the dégâts

648
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,540
from the soul goods rolled up?

649
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,100
It's already very kind of you

650
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,260
to not settle the score with us.

651
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,420
Hurry up and leave!

652
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,700
Go and get Shi Qianli back.

653
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:06,900
Shi Qianli?

654
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,380
What did he do again?

655
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:10,540
He wants to live.

656
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,500
We can't let him die so easily.

657
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:13,700
Yes.

658
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,740
Shi Qianli

659
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:29,340
Master.

660
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,260
Stop looking. Let's go.

661
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,780
Why are you following me?

662
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,540
Master.

663
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,740
Did Ting Yan accidentally hurt you?

664
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:50,660
Your hand...

665
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,260
I'll ask Bai Zhu to come and help you.

666
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:53,780
No need.

667
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,100
What's the use of helping me?

668
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,100
Master.

669
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,860
Since you've combined the two powers of fire,

670
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,340
your martial arts have been strong,

671
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,780
but your counterattacks have been getting stronger.

672
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,780
It's even harder to heal the wound.

673
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,740
Stop talking nonsense.

674
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,860
I want to use the skill of Soul-saving.

675
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,820
You'll protect me from the side.

676
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:16,700
Master.

677
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,900
This is too much damage to you.

678
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,140
You even took the Heart-guarding Bone

679
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,060
to make the Defending Moon Pillar for Ting Yan.

680
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,340
I know what I'm doing.

681
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,100
Okay.

682
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,380
I'll protect you.

683
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:42,180
E'erhe Stir-fried Rice Qual29

684
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,780
Sima Jiao has protected Yan,

685
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,500
yet he let him marry another woman

686
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,060
and replaced her to academia president.

687
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,340
Did you guys watch carefully?

688
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,540
Yes,

689
00:40:58,860 --> 00:40:59,940
that Yan.

690
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:11,700
Si Ma Jiao is deeply in love with Liao Ting Yan.

691
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,420
How could he have a new lover

692
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,780
in such a short time?

693
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:21,220
I'm afraid that A Yan

694
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,980
is Liao Ting Yan.

695
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,460
That's great.

696
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:26,740
But

697
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,740
Dong Cheng is now Si Ma Jiao's territory.

698
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,980
We need to find a way

699
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,540
to get Liao Ting Yan out of Dong Cheng.

700
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:40,300
Then we can get together with her.

701
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,580
You've been in contact

702
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:47,060
with the late general of the Chang family, right?

703
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,300
Yes.

704
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:51,900
Now he has become a vanguard.

705
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,620
He is doing some house-keeping work in Hexian City.

706
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,260
According to your order,

707
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:01,100
I'll send some people to help him.

708
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:06,180
He is very close to A Yan.

709
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:10,300
It's time to send some people.
