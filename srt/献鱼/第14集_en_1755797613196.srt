1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The wind and the moon are the same.

2
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
But between us, love can be changed.

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Who loves me?

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I can't heat up the lifetime of love.

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Even if this life is endless and I can't live it,

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I still want to be with you.

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We will never change in this life.

8
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We will never change in this life.

9
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I heard that they lost their trace here.

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
There's so much blood.

11
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It seems like Sima Jiao is badly injured.

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Princess De, there's a blood stain here.

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Let's look through the blood stain.

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
They came too.

15
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
They've already left?

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
They're not coming.

17
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
They are here too.

18
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,720
The blood has disappeared

19
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,840
when we arrived here.

20
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,160
It's really strange.

21
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,520
It seems that

22
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,800
we can't track down

23
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,160
the whereabouts of Sima Jiao anymore.

24
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,960
He must have some kind of secret trick

25
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,760
hidden in him.

26
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,800
We should search more closely.

27
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,120
Sima Jiao has killed

28
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,200
countless innocent lives

29
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,880
in Chiyan City and Bai Feng Mountain.

30
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,360
If we don't seal him

31
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,320
while he is badly injured,

32
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,800
he will definitely kill us

33
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,400
when his martial arts are restored.

34
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,800
Although that's true,

35
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,080
we can't let him

36
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,200
stay here anymore.

37
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,160
I think

38
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,400
we should go back

39
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,400
and discuss the countermeasures

40
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,400
with other princesses.

41
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,560
Let's go.

42
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,320
The body of Ji Han who transferred the court

43
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,160
is in a bad shape.

44
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,360
I can't take his internal order to hurt him.

45
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,480
If we want to break the barrier of the Immortals and Demons,

46
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,080
there is only one way left

47
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,000
to kill Sima Jiao.

48
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,720
The spirit fire has been extinguished and the barrier has been broken.

49
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,680
He was too powerful before.

50
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,640
I couldn't kill him.

51
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:25,840
Now,

52
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,920
he is badly injured and is alone.

53
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,920
If I work with him,

54
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,160
I may not win.

55
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:42,960
What are you afraid of?

56
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,760
What do you think I'm afraid of?

57
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,840
Please forgive me, Master.

58
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,600
I really can't stand it.

59
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,240
Don't bother.

60
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,560
Why?

61
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,120
You don't like it?

62
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,240
I don't like it.

63
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,480
It seems that you are seriously injured this time.

64
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,040
Even the spirit fire has been extinguished.

65
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,920
You said

66
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,560
you didn't like it.

67
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,880
Do you like it very much?

68
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,320
Why do you force me to tell the truth?

69
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,160
There are many ways to know a person's true heart.

70
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,000
Without the truth,

71
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,080
I can now tell

72
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,560
whether what you said is true or not.

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,520
What's going on?

74
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,360
It seems that the fire is telling the truth.

75
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,720
Si Ma Xiu really likes me.

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,960
The specialties of Xingu Tian

77
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,240
can make you feel better.

78
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,200
I'll give you a try.

79
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,800
He doesn't look like he's been badly injured.

80
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,560
This is the spiritual realm that the man changed.

81
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,840
In half a day,

82
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,360
it will be disbanded.

83
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,560
No wonder it's not dark

84
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,240
and there are no soldiers.

85
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,560
By the way,

86
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,400
the master asked me to tell you

87
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,480
that there are other spirit fires in this world.

88
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,880
What do you mean?

89
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm afraid it's the spirit fire

90
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,800
that Shi Qian Lv raised privately.

91
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,440
It hasn't been extinguished.

92
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,400
Why does Shi Qian Lv raise spirit fires?

93
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,400
Spirit fires can only be raised by your Si Ma clan.

94
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,720
Do you know

95
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,400
Si Ma clan is a god who can fly?

96
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,280
There's a story in the history of Geng Chen.

97
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,920
Many years ago,

98
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,440
many immortals from Si Ma clan

99
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,480
used thunder to fly to become a god.

100
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,960
Flying to become a god

101
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,960
is just a joke in this world.

102
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,240
In the past,

103
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,080
without immortals flying,

104
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,120
there would be abundant spiritual energy in this world.

105
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,280
I know that.

106
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,640
The book says

107
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,120
it's because immortals fly,

108
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,280
the immortal world connects with the lower realm,

109
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,760
and spiritual energy enters the mortal world.

110
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,440
It's true.

111
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,160
The immortals who fly

112
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,360
can't go to the immortal world.

113
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,400
Instead, they are scattered in the world.

114
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,400
The soul and flesh

115
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,240
are turned into pure spiritual energy

116
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,880
and are replenished in this world.

117
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,720
Now,

118
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,080
the Si Ma clan is about to be destroyed.

119
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,920
It's the heaven's will

120
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,840
to destroy Si Ma clan.

121
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,840
No wonder Mr. Ba and Mr. Shi

122
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,520
are so careless

123
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,920
to trick the rest of your Si Ma clan.

124
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,280
It's because...

125
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:55,840
I know

126
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,840
the so-called flying to become a god

127
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,480
is all fake.

128
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,960
Except for the Si Ma clan,

129
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,240
no one knows

130
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,480
how to end the flying curse

131
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,200
and how to connect with the spiritual energy.

132
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,600
You told me

133
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,160
such a big secret?

134
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,280
I don't need a secret from you.

135
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,880
It seems that

136
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,000
Mr. Shi knows about this secret

137
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,720
and he's greedy.

138
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,480
So he's trying to get the immortality

139
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,320
by keeping the spiritual energy.

140
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,440
Is that right?

141
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,160
Yes.

142
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,160
He created the Mount Baifeng

143
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,000
to get the blood of Mount Feng

144
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,280
with the blood of the Immortal Blood.

145
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,440
That's how he got the foundation

146
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,240
to merge with the spiritual energy.

147
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,760
But now,

148
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,960
I've destroyed Mount Baifeng.

149
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,120
He can't continue to keep the spiritual energy.

150
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,000
But according to the old man,

151
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,680
Shi Qianli's spiritual energy hasn't been used up.

152
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,240
It means that he still has the blood of Mount Baifeng

153
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,160
in another place.

154
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,800
He's trying to get the immortality by changing his blood.

155
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,680
Shi Qianli is so bold.

156
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,720
Are you going to kill him now?

157
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,240
How can I kill him?

158
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,200
I'll bury the dark fire in the nine spiritual mountains

159
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,160
of the Shi clan.

160
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,360
When I find the spiritual fire of Shi Qianli,

161
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,400
I'll light the shadow of the spiritual mountain

162
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,880
and destroy Shi's family.

163
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,440
It's a hundred-year dream.

164
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,840
But you just woke up.

165
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,440
You should recuperate first.

166
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,640
I don't know medical skills.

167
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,160
If you fall again,

168
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,600
I can't save you. What should I do?

169
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:35,760
It doesn't matter.

170
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,560
I have many ways to destroy the shadow of the Shi family.

171
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,640
As long as I don't wake up,

172
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,120
no one can hurt me.

173
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,120
Do you still want to die now?

174
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,200
You have to save me with such a great effort.

175
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,000
I'll live.

176
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,240
Where are we going next?

177
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,280
Go find the people of the Shi clan.

178
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,480
Princess Ye.

179
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,240
Princess Ye.

180
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,520
What's the matter?

181
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,400
I'm here to ask you

182
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,680
how to deal with Si Ma Jiao

183
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,400
if he is found.

184
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,480
Of course,

185
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,960
I'll seal him in the Three-Legend Mountain again.

186
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,040
Then,

187
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,360
please open the seal

188
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,120
and needle with us.

189
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,720
I'm afraid

190
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,120
you

191
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,040
have another plan.

192
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,960
Where did you say that?

193
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,560
The Shi clan is in charge of the Baifeng Mountain.

194
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,680
I'm curious

195
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,880
where the blood of the Feng family

196
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,320
is left in the mountain.

197
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,760
I'm also curious.

198
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,480
You didn't tell the other princesses

199
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,520
about these words.

200
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,200
But you came to find me.

201
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,560
What's your plan?

202
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,360
I want Si Ma Jiao's life.

203
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,240
I didn't expect

204
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,040
that Princess Ye has already

205
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,120
hated Si Ma Jiao so much.

206
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,640
Princess Ye's death

207
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,600
is not for revenge,

208
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,560
but to

209
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,480
break the barrier between the evil and the evil.

210
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,120
We both have secrets.

211
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,560
So we don't need to hide.

212
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,920
I just want to ask you one question.

213
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,440
Do you want to kill Si Ma Jiao?

214
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,440
I can cooperate with Princess Ye

215
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,480
to kill him.

216
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,640
But

217
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,080
what should I do

218
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,920
to help you?

219
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,920
I'll keep the Baifeng Mountain

220
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,880
as a secret.

221
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,920
That's the advantage.

222
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,520
Princess Ye,

223
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,520
I have many ways to seal your mouth.

224
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,160
What do you think

225
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,400
these things are for?

226
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,080
One quick news.

227
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,520
The Co部长们别忘了

228
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,760
我虽修为不及你倒 bomb 侵

229
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,520
可我毕竟是一公之主

230
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,400
希望师长们

231
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,800
莫要小瞧了我

232
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,760
After it's done,

233
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,880
you can take whatever you want.

234
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,280
I appreciate your determination.

235
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,000
I hope you can

236
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,760
tell me the truth in time.

237
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,320
I hope you can keep your promise.

238
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,600
Greetings, Aunt.

239
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,720
Don't stand on ceremony.

240
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,040
I'm incompetent.

241
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,800
I disappointed you.

242
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,480
That's why I disturbed you.

243
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,640
It's okay.

244
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,760
I've been training

245
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,600
to improve my cultivation.

246
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,400
I can help you to help me one day.

247
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,720
Now,

248
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,840
it's important to catch Sima Jiao as soon as possible.

249
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,640
It's not your fault

250
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,440
that Baifeng Mountain was destroyed.

251
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,760
You don't have to blame yourself.

252
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,680
Thank you, Aunt.

253
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,760
Listen up,

254
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,160
follow me to split up with your Young Master

255
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,320
and find out where Sima Jiao is.

256
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,200
Yes.

257
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,240
Master,

258
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,200
why can't they see us

259
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,400
and bump into us?

260
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,800
I used the Hidden Technique to hide.

261
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,160
They're low-level.

262
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,160
They can avoid

263
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,480
the strong wind.

264
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,040
It's useful even if you're hurt.

265
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,320
Even if I'm not seriously injured,

266
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,720
they're not my match.

267
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,560
We can just use the Hidden Technique.

268
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,680
The Hidden Technique

269
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,800
consumes a lot of spiritual power.

270
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,440
Otherwise,

271
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,040
I can only keep the world in peace.

272
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,480
Right.

273
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,840
You're seriously injured.

274
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,400
All the high-level techniques are out of order.

275
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,760
Why don't we keep a low profile?

276
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,400
After all, the Prince of Tau is not the Du family.

277
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,400
You don't have to worry about these things.

278
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,480
With me,

279
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,800
you're the Du family everywhere.

280
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,280
Yes.

281
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,240
You have a good speech.

282
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,360
By the way,

283
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,160
where are we?

284
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,280
It feels more and more remote

285
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,400
along the way.

286
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,880
Luohe Fairy Hall

287
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,720
is a place where ordinary people and cultivators gather.

288
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,160
It's the most remote place in the Immortal's Mansion.

289
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,800
No wonder they don't know how to do magic.

290
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,200
There are few cultivators.

291
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,560
It's more like a place where ordinary people gather.

292
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,320
They're all people who are excluded

293
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,920
or lack of cultivation.

294
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,720
Am I

295
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,520
a big boss here?

296
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:33,840
Now,

297
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,760
you've reached the end of your life.

298
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,400
You can only get in

299
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,800
if you're one step away.

300
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,080
What a bad place!

301
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,800
Be careful with your actions.

302
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,160
You'll ruin my stuff.

303
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,640
You're so mean.

304
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,760
How can I help you as a manager?

305
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,120
Mr. Chen,

306
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,800
I already rest you two alone.

307
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,280
No, no, no.

308
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,200
I'll handle my family affairs.

309
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,000
Please reflect on yourself.

310
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,160
Nothing else matters.

311
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,880
Do you dare to look at me this way?

312
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,960
Is that

313
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,000
all?

314
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,720
Go and make a looked-out for me.

315
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,240
No, I must keep it dry.

316
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,240
Have you seen him?

317
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:17,920
No.

318
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,720
Have you seen this man?

319
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,200
Have you seen this man?

320
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:22,760
Si Ma Jiao.

321
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:23,800
Go after him.

322
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,480
Up there.

323
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,640
You two, go that way.

324
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:34,960
Okay.

325
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,640
You two, come with me.

326
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,040
Yes.

327
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,280
This way.

328
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,280
Who is it?

329
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,520
Who's that?

330
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,040
Who are you?

331
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,640
Now?

332
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,800
Is someone else in just now?

333
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,800
Have you two not kept your eyes open?

334
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,360
Or do we still call it your room?

335
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,720
Me, greater all my brothers and underlings

336
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,440
are going to relocate to you.

337
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,160
Master, there is indeed a rumor recently

338
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,700
that the grand- Luckily, anger be Mudu's grand grand daughter

339
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,080
are coming foration.

340
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,360
of the world.

341
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:47,840
Let's go.

342
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,040
Here you are.

343
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,240
Are they

344
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,600
the Silly Brothers and Silly Sisters?

345
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,360
Yes.

346
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,880
Didn't we go to revenge on Shi Qianli?

347
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,080
Why did we dress up like them?

348
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,640
You made me feel low.

349
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,200
I saw them

350
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,080
with their identities.

351
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,080
They are the granddaughters of Mu's father.

352
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,280
The Mu family has been in a relationship with Shi clan for many years.

353
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,800
They are Shi clan's forces.

354
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,600
But the Mu family

355
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,400
is hidden in the border area

356
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:33,960
of Luohe County.

357
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,760
They won't be noticed by Shi Qianli

358
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,680
with their identities.

359
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,160
I see.

360
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,000
It's probably convenient for us to take revenge.

361
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,880
It's not easy to be found.

362
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,920
Finally.

363
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,480
Grandfather.

364
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,280
Good.

365
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,480
I'm relieved

366
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,520
to see you are not tired.

367
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,640
From now on,

368
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,720
you will live in the Chens' Mansion

369
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,880
like other students.

370
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,040
You must study hard.

371
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,720
Don't lose the relationship

372
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,320
between the Chens and the Yeyou Palace.

373
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,400
It seems that we are really going to school.

374
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,400
It's fine if we don't go.

375
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,280
This school is very boring.

376
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,440
But we are acting as our identities.

377
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,080
What if we are exposed if we don't go?

378
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,000
What are you talking about?

379
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,280
Later,

380
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,400
go to the Chens' Mansion

381
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,360
and prove your name with the steward.

382
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,880
It's so hot.

383
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,640
It's so hot.

384
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,640
It's so hot.

385
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,360
I've never seen this before.

386
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,400
It's hot.

387
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,720
The Fu is here.

388
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,400
The Fu is here.

389
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,800
As we all know,

390
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,440
the high and low of the cultivation

391
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,360
determines the strength of the spiritual power and the magic.

392
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,200
This is our old Fu.

393
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,640
This is too...

394
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,440
Listen carefully.

395
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:09,920
Sorry...

396
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,720
What's the matter?

397
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,840
It's the last time I go to attend Nice to you.

398
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,680
My spicy school has been closed for a few days.

399
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,720
One of the teachers said

400
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,360
she would school more girls in nice Somewhere in active time.

401
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,200
Then,

402
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,000
and she said

403
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,560
it is normal for girls

404
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,040
to study more useless things and obtain more smart than others.

405
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,800
And in parallel with

406
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,080
The first preceptor

407
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,680
Besides the great Taoist priest

408
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,600
So he can't see

409
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,880
What are we really doing

410
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,360
Provided us with

411
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,040
Practice conditions for the best of the best

412
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,200
There is another reason

413
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,120
Is that we have the most magic books

414
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,640
Let's practice it too

415
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,320
The basic is not reliable

416
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,800
It's easy to turn over

417
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,560
Don't you want to sleep

418
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,040
Why did you suddenly listen to the class

419
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,800
Aren't you hurt

420
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,520
I think if I can learn a little magic

421
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,800
Maybe when can I help you

422
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,280
No need

423
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,480
You do what you want to do

424
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,880
This is what I want to do

425
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,880
I'm not afraid of you

426
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,880
I'm not afraid of you

427
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,880
I'm not afraid of you

428
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,880
I'm not afraid of you

429
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,880
I'm not afraid of you

430
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,920
I'm not afraid of you

431
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,560
Even if I can't help you

432
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,920
Then if there is anything special

433
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,320
If I can save myself

434
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,080
I can stop dragging you

435
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,640
What can the half-chopped on it teach you

436
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,600
You are best at using earth

437
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,600
Water

438
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,600
Wood

439
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,760
Use to attack

440
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,040
Defense and speed

441
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,480
You can also use the eye-shining technique

442
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,040
It's a bit cool

443
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,040
A bit cool

444
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,040
With your current cultivation

445
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,040
Can enter space freely

446
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,600
No need to use this kind of thing again

447
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,080
Space

448
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,200
In my body

449
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,720
Space is in your soul

450
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,440
No one can enter

451
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,840
I try

452
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,280
What kind of fresh stuff are you

453
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,720
Oh yeah

454
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,880
What are these

455
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,000
The tribes close to the dead

456
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,240
How do you know these tribes

457
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,480
Close to the dead

458
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,240
The death of the Fengqi Pavilion

459
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,560
You forgot

460
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,840
Then you are through

461
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,760
At that time, the confrontation situation

462
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,360
Completed their division of power

463
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,200
You won't kill all these people, will you

464
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,840
I won't kill these disciples

465
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,240
I just use them

466
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,120
Change the direction of the world

467
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,920
Find the soul for me

468
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,280
Just fight for some time

469
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,240
Can't see you, the devil

470
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,560
I started to care about us

471
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,360
The lives of these little Lou

472
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,800
You are leaving now

473
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,960
It's not good to escape, right

474
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,800
Or go around the space

475
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,240
Succeeded

476
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,280
Want to eat more here

477
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,200
Come

478
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,240
Eat some food first

479
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,040
Life supplies

480
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,240
What if we are found by the people of the Shi family

481
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,320
Hide in the mountains

482
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,680
Life can be more comfortable

483
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,920
I have to prepare some medicine

484
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,680
The body of Sima Jiao

485
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,600
Can't get better after half a year of injury

486
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,920
Prepare some medicine

487
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,200
Prepare for the need

488
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,360
What else to write

489
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,520
Got it

490
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,200
I will fifth

491
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,200
I'm in charge of co-op

492
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,400
No need

493
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:42,280
Just a bit

494
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,000
No problem

495
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,640
You are the night superiors

496
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,280
Can beuu the half-siblings

497
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,440
Where's your brother

498
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,920
I'm sorry.

499
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,600
My name is Qi Letian.

500
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,520
You're Yong Linchun, right?

501
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,840
Listen,

502
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,760
our...

503
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,040
Our family has been friends for generations.

504
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,000
You can call me Brother Qi.

505
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,240
Maybe I can take care of you in the future.

506
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,720
There are no rules in the guest room.

507
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,120
Stand outside.

508
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,920
Be quiet!

509
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,520
It's a pity that Si Ma Jiao didn't see my ability to sell my blood.

510
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,840
My disciples have searched Baifeng Mountain

511
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,560
but they didn't find Si Ma Jiao.

512
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,360
Si Ma Jiao should have fled to somewhere else.

513
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,760
It's meaningless for us to search near Baifeng Mountain again.

514
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:55,920
Princess Ye,

515
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,920
how can you be willing to work with us today?

516
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,640
It's really strange.

517
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,520
As the Princess of Yanzhi Palace,

518
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,160
I should focus on the grand plan of the County Office.

519
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,760
What's wrong with that?

520
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,720
Alright, everyone.

521
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,760
Everyone,

522
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,960
don't be distracted by small things.

523
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,120
The priority is to work together

524
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,880
to catch Si Ma Jiao

525
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,960
and seal him again.

526
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,840
Princess,

527
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,600
now the Grand Master has become

528
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,400
the most important envoy of other palaces.

529
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,360
Do we still have to help the Grand Master secretly?

530
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:39,840
I found Shi Zhen Xu

531
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,560
destroying some corpses secretly

532
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,000
in Baifeng Mountain a few days ago.

533
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,080
It's not easy.

534
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,880
Although the Grand Master is a man of a man's nature,

535
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,560
he is definitely not a man who kills and does not do anything.

536
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,200
Compared to the Grand Master,

537
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,720
the Grand Master is more important than the Grand Master.

538
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,880
The Grand Master is more important than the Grand Master.

539
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,880
The Grand Master is more important than the Grand Master.

540
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,960
But you have asked me to help Baifeng Mountain

541
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,440
to deal with the Grand Master.

542
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,480
I'm afraid Shi Qian Lv will suspect something.

543
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,800
You immediately tell Shi Zhen Xu

544
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,600
to destroy the corpses secretly

545
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,680
and reveal it to the Sun Ghost.

546
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,440
Yes.

547
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,360
Grand Master,

548
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,360
it was an emergency that day.

549
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,160
We didn't ask about the Baifeng Mountain

550
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,600
too clearly.

551
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,480
I heard that the Grand Master's cultivation

552
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,240
has reached the capital city.

553
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,720
The battle between Baifeng Mountain and Sima Jiao

554
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,680
is as weak as before.

555
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,640
Could it be that they were playing a trick on us?

556
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,280
Could it be that Baifeng Mountain

557
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,920
is also your hand?

558
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,080
What Princess Di said

559
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,280
is that you heard about the Sima Jiao's death.

560
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,480
You also suspect that I

561
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,560
built Baifeng Mountain

562
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,480
to improve my cultivation

563
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,000
by drinking blood.

564
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,400
Then I...

565
00:28:59,400 --> 00:28:59,880
I...

566
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,800
Princess Di,

567
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,920
don't be fooled by the Sima Jiao's words.

568
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,920
There was nothing serious in the former Magistrate's Mansion.

569
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,640
Even if the Grand Master's cultivation is high,

570
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,080
he has no place to fight.

571
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,880
So he didn't do anything in front of people.

572
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,480
I think he didn't hide it on purpose.

573
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,120
That's right.

574
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,760
If he really wants to drink people's blood,

575
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,920
why bother to

576
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,000
build this huge Baifeng Mountain?

577
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,400
You must be worried too much.

578
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,280
Yes.

579
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,840
You can do whatever you want.

580
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,680
But you need to

581
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,200
seal Sima Jiao again.

582
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,600
That's the most important thing.

583
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:41,880
Princess Di,

584
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,200
what do you think?

585
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,080
I'm with all the palaces.

586
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,520
Good.

587
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,680
In that case,

588
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,400
from now on,

589
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,520
we'll expand the search range.

590
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,960
We must catch Sima Jiao as soon as possible.

591
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,080
We can't let him open the killing trap

592
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,080
and hurt the innocent again.

593
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,160
Everyone,

594
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,680
please.

595
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,400
Father.

596
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,880
Go and check

597
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,520
what the Japanese know.

598
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:30,760
Yes.

599
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,800
Ling Chun.

600
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,400
Ling Chun.

601
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,240
Tomorrow night, the students of Chenxue Prefecture

602
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,920
will attend the assembly at Jingxiu Hall.

603
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:46,760
Will you come?

604
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,040
What assembly?

605
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,320
Is it a communication?

606
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,640
How can we learn from the past?

607
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,920
It's just a gathering

608
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,880
and drinking party.

609
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,640
Is there such a good thing?

610
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,760
The young masters and young ladies of all the families will attend.

611
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,160
It's a good opportunity to make friends.

612
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,680
Ling Chun, you must come.

613
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,880
Although I can eat and drink,

614
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,200
I always feel that

615
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,320
the young masters and young ladies at the banquet will be in trouble.

616
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,280
And I, the first lady of Yongling Spring,

617
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,520
don't seem to be a good lady.

618
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,040
What if I get involved in the past grudges?

619
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,520
Should I go or not?

620
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,440
Everyone in the whole classroom except Sima Jiao went.

621
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,960
If I don't cover her up,

622
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,320
it will be more troublesome to attract other people's attention.

623
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,160
I miss the days when Sima Jiao took me to the banquet.

624
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,600
She should be looking for the spirit fire

625
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,760
that Shi Qianli has cultivated.

626
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,520
I don't know how it is.

627
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,440
Why do I feel like I'm falling?

628
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,480
It's been 500 years.

629
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,920
The spirit wisdom of the world

630
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,280
is still full of spirit energy.

631
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,440
Shi Qianli,

632
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,400
your days are very peaceful.

633
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,840
It's time to change.

634
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,920
Shi Qianli!

635
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,640
Shi Qianli!

636
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,800
I...

637
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:30,760
I won.

638
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,360
I won easily.

639
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,720
You can't get in if you hold me for 2 years.

640
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:40,320
How can I get in if I can't use the spirit products in the spirit way?

641
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,120
You...

642
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,760
How can you get in if you hold me for 2 years?

643
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,440
You can't get in if you hold me for 2 years.

644
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,720
If you find Feng Shan Linghuo's whereabouts

645
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,600
and let me know immediately...

646
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:55,700
Yes.

647
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,720
Si Ma was still alive even when he was dead.

648
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,020
But would this

649
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,300
hinder the peace of Ting Yan?

650
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:14,960
Endure?

651
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,360
What is it?

652
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:22,440
I've always let you 지금

653
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,120
a danger for yourself?

654
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,480
It has not been that serious for you.

655
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,280
It's not every day you're living.

656
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,200
Normally,

657
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,320
it's all the weight,

658
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,360
and only you still keep an eye on it.

659
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,840
It's an deb dicen missy.

660
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,840
Nobody wants you to live a life

661
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,580
I won't be able to do anything else.

662
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,540
You're not in the room.

663
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,220
Why are you here?

664
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,780
You haven't come to see me for days.

665
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,860
I just want to see you.

666
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,380
I...

667
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,140
I've been busy these days.

668
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,260
I don't have time to visit you.

669
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:04,860
It's okay.

670
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:07,980
I'm thinking

671
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,460
I should go to see my master and his family.

672
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,380
When are you going to start?

673
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,800
Of course, as soon as possible.

674
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,520
It's just...

675
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,720
Just what?

676
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,160
I just can't bear to part with you.

677
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:26,560
I...

678
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,720
But now,

679
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,800
the people of the Shi family and the Eight Great Palace

680
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,000
are looking for their master everywhere.

681
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,840
You're so handsome and handsome

682
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,120
and show up in my hall.

683
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,840
Aren't you afraid of being exposed?

684
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,360
Don't worry.

685
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,160
They can't find me.

686
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,440
And...

687
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,840
You're here.

688
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:54,840
Right?

689
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,560
I won't cause you any trouble.

690
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,120
I really...

691
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,320
I really want to see you

692
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,160
before I leave.

693
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,120
I want to talk to you.

694
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,460
Besides, I don't sleep

695
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,980
in such a place at night.

696
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,460
Look at the beam over there.

697
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,060
That pillar.

698
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,540
I can sleep anywhere.

699
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,300
I can sleep anywhere.

700
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:31,900
So can you

701
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,620
allow me to stay with you tonight?

702
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:38,860
I...

703
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:39,660
Master.

704
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,420
Master FCC은

705
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,180
we can't stay in this place tonight.

706
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:51,700
Let me see.

707
00:35:59,220 --> 00:35:59,860
I'll lay it first,

708
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,020
you can go to sleep in your room.

709
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,860
Try to take a rest.

710
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,920
No.

711
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,520
Tonight,

712
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,720
you should hide in your room

713
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,120
and rest.

714
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,520
Don't come here.

715
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,120
Or...

716
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,120
Or I'll sleep in your room.

717
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:42,920
Zhu Li,

718
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,920
your eyes

719
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,320
are shining.

720
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,320
So beautiful.

721
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,120
Good.

722
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,520
You know how to praise others

723
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,520
and you have the ability to be a person.

724
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,520
Really?

725
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,920
Then I'll praise you more.

726
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:05,920
Your...

727
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,120
When you don't know what you aren't,

728
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,520
you should have realized the importance.

729
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:29,440
It's also

730
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,680
so I can't let you fly away.

731
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:45,960
Let's go.

732
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,100
Meanwhile master Master,

733
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,660
don't forget to go to your room first!

734
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,020
Lin搞得很乖。

735
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,320
Yinchun,

736
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,080
So ugly.

737
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,320
Your cousin?

738
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,120
He said he was a rare disciple

739
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,840
who was stabbed in the ass by me a few days ago.

740
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,720
Family members,

741
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,920
we have to

742
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,000
tell the truth, right?

743
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,880
You can't just come to me

744
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,080
just because you heard it.

745
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,600
Isn't it a little too hasty?

746
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,600
You said that.

747
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,760
It seems that I really can't think it through.

748
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,880
You treat me as your family member.

749
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,000
I'll go.

750
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,200
It's okay. I can't go to you in person.

751
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,680
Then thank you.

752
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,320
You're welcome.

753
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,840
Why did you turn to him?

754
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:25,840
I say,

755
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,640
why do people from Yueyou Palace

756
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,000
come to our Gengchen's mansion to study?

757
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,640
I don't think your spiritual roots are that good.

758
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,920
You can't learn anything if you want to.

759
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,920
Why don't you find a reason

760
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,520
and just let it go?

761
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,520
Yes, you're right.

762
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,200
Are you here to find a reason?

763
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,360
It's a pity that

764
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,720
you can't be a good student

765
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,480
among the students here.

766
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,240
You'd better know yourself.

767
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,760
Yes, I think so, too.

768
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,280
Stop pretending.

769
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,040
If you don't agree,

770
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,640
we can have a competition.

771
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,000
No, no.

772
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,400
A gentleman should not talk.

773
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,760
Besides, what you said is reasonable.

774
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:09,960
Well...

775
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,280
I can't make it clear to you.

776
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,320
You should know yourself.

777
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,000
Didn't you say that

778
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,240
Yongling Chun is a bad temper?

779
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,160
He's so arrogant.

780
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:25,680
Well...

781
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,440
Why is he like a man?

782
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,800
He doesn't respond to anything.

783
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:29,880
Right.

784
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:30,720
Let's go.

785
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,680
He's talking about Yongling Chun.

786
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,080
Not me.

787
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,440
Do you know

788
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,120
something happened in the house today?

789
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,200
What happened?

790
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,280
I heard that the teacher was furious

791
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,200
and killed many people.

792
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,040
It's just that a girl he likes

793
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,240
blew him a whole wind.

794
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,800
The master wanted to hide it from him.

795
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,200
I heard that

796
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,600
the teacher and the master had a dispute.

797
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,040
Now they're hiding in Bailu Cliff.

798
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,960
It must have covered the real situation.

799
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,800
I thought that

800
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,720
if the teacher went out,

801
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,760
our Gengchen Fairy Mansion would be stronger.

802
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,120
Now it seems

803
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,840
it's not a good thing

804
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,760
to have this teacher.

805
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,040
The teacher has a high level of cultivation.

806
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,520
And he's the only son of the Sima Clan.

807
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,160
It's normal to be casual.

808
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,160
You've read the history of Gengchen.

809
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,320
The teacher is the pillar of Gengchen Fairy Mansion.

810
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,440
He's a great senior

811
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,760
who deserves our respect and worship.

812
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,360
Yes.

813
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,400
If we have a chance,

814
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,120
I'd like to serve the teacher.

815
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,240
Yes.

816
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,360
If you know that you're in the same room with the teacher,

817
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,640
you don't look up every day.

818
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,120
What's the mood?

819
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,480
It's a pity.

820
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,320
Well.

821
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,440
I can't

822
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,200
look at SimaORE at any time.

823
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,480
The dust is still there.

824
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,480
The dust is still there.

825
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,480
The dust is still there.

826
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,480
The dust is still there.

827
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,480
The dust is still there.

828
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,480
The dust is still there.

829
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,480
The dust is still there.

830
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,480
The dust is still there.

831
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,480
The dust is still there.

832
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,480
The dust is still there.

833
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,480
The dust is still there.

00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,480
The dust is still there.

835
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,480
The dust is still there.

836
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,480
The dust is still there.

837
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,480
The dust is still there.

838
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,480
The dust is still there.

839
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,480
The dust is still there.

840
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,480
The dust is still there.

841
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,480
The dust is still there.

842
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,480
The dust is still there.

843
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,480

848
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,480
The dust is still there.

849
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,480
