OST credit

3
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,660
 ♫ Heavens strike with thunderous wrath ♫ 

4
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,420
 ♫ Mountains and rivers shatter before my eyes ♫ 

5
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,680
 ♫ Endless splendor
cultivated through lifetimes ♫ 

6
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,140
 ♫ Turns to dust between my fingers
in an instant ♫ 

7
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,220
 ♫ When the line
between good and evil is clear ♫ 

8
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,240
 ♫ Countless souls drift
into the boundless wilds ♫ 

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,500
 ♫ Carrying the spirit fire forward ♫ 

10
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,880
 ♫ I defy fate Just to remain by your side ♫ 

11
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,900
 ♫ Falling into love's abyss ♫ 

12
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,780
 ♫ Like heavy rain pouring down ♫ 

13
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:08,460
 ♫ Drunk on romance ♫ 

14
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,340
 ♫ In a blink, love and hate
vanish into illusion ♫ 

15
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,300
 ♫ Falling into endless love ♫ 

16
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,420
 ♫ Stirring waves upending a lifetime ♫ 

17
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,660
 ♫ Even if this life leads to ruin ♫ 

18
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:27,020
 ♫ I still choose to be entangled with you ♫ 

19
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,225
 ♫ Through all lifetimes ♫ 

20
00:01:30,225 --> 00:01:36,500
 

21
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,397
 

22
00:01:41,183 --> 00:01:44,223
 Why did something inside me just stir? 

23
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,080
 What is it trying to tell me? 

24
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,680
Have a nice day, sir.
 

25
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,760
Welcome, sir.

26
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,290
 Did he fly all the way here just to... 

27
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,360
 Is this some late-life scandal plot or what? 

28
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,600
- Pipe down.
- What?

29
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,800
Did I say anything just now?

30
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,920
Grandmaster, can you read minds?

31
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,960
No, I can't.

32
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,840
Then let me test it again.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,600
 Sima Jiao, you crazy old man! 

34
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,540
Are you cursing me?

35
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,860
No.

36
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,080
Please have a look inside, sir.

37
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,140
This way, please.

38
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,360
Take care, Mr. Wang.

39
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,160
It's been a long while.

40
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,630
Yes, a long while.

41
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,140
Nian Jiu.

42
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,160
Stay here with it and wait for my orders.

43
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,540
Yes.

44
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,680
Let me tag along.

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,120
This way, please, sir.

46
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,380
This really blows my mind.

47
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,140
Nian Jiu is actually missing out
on such shocking scenes.

48
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,220
He's just transformed into a human.

49
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,300
Why let him see things like this?

50
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,320
No wonder you didn't let him in.

51
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,060
I see. It's not kid-friendly.

52
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,880
Never thought you were this kind of man.

53
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,280
I came here to look for someone.

54
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,680
As if.

55
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,400
Mr. Yan.

56
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,000
Didn't you just take in
your 14th concubine today?

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,760
Why aren't you spending the night with her,

58
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,720
but coming here to seek pleasure?

59
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,260
Why indeed?

60
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,280
She's already mine.  

61
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,140
There's no need to rush it.

62
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,280
Cheer up, Mr. Yan.

63
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,760
- Come.
- The 14th concubine?

64
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,060
This man is scum through and through.

65
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,840
Do you see that person?

66
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,960
I do.

67
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,320
The distance is far.

68
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,080
He looks rather small.

69
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,020
I see it. There's a flame-shaped birthmark
on his back.

70
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,740
Grandmaster, is he the one you're looking for?

71
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,960
Grandmaster, he's coming up.

72
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,440
Huan.

73
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,900
Why are you here again?

74
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,100
When will you stop pestering me?

75
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,760
Huan...
 

76
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,540
You once said you'd love only me.

77
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,560
But...

78
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,460
why do you still come here to seek pleasure?

79
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,280
Hey. Where's the owner here?

80
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,880
- Coming.
- Huan, you...

81
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,360
- Take this whining wench out.
- Yes, sir.

82
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,480
- Go.
- Huan.

83
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,920
- Huan.
- Leave.

84
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,860
- Just leave.
- Huan!

85
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,760
He's a piece of work.

86
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,760
If this were in the modern day,

87
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,380
he'd have been exposed and canceled.

88
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,840
You sure have many concerns.

89
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,040
What do you mean, "canceled"?

90
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,680
It's the most miserable fate.

91
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,720
Worse than death.

92
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,220
Let's go.

93
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,840
Mr. Yan.

94
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,720
Mr. Yan, am I so unattractive

95
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,240
that you won't touch me even once?

96
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,880
Go away.

97
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,520
Yes, sir.

98
00:05:30,647 --> 00:05:32,307
Who are you?

99
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,520
What are you trying to do?

100
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,440
Grandmaster, does this man
have anything to do with your clan?

101
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,640
I'm wondering the same.

102
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,240
I feel a blood resonance with him.

103
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,760
Mr. Yan.

104
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,880
Mr. Yan.

105
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,800
You only changed your clothes.

106
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,080
Why did they all think
you were that Mr. Low-Stamina?

107
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,280
It's an illusion.

108
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,620
Grandmaster, are you going to pose as him to get inside the enemy's base?

109
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,960
I thought you were the frontal assault type.

110
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,960
I never thought you could use
roundabout tactics.

111
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,400
Not bad.

112
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,120
Mr. Yan, you look much better.

113
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,960
It was indeed a lovely night, huh?

114
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,360
My hand!

115
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,060
- If you don't want that hand, I don't mind breaking it. 
 - I want it!

116
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,560
Stop it!

117
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,000
I overestimated your roundabout tactics.

118
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,480
You're Mr. Yan now.

119
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,400
Don't give yourself away.

120
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,720
Huan.

121
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,680
Huan.

122
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,380
Mr. Yan.

123
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,540
Mr. Yan.

124
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,380
You've been avoiding me.

125
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,920
Do the vows we once made mean nothing now?

126
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,920
Poor lady.

127
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,000
Perhaps you shouldn't break her heart.

128
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,600
That's none of my concern.

129
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,540
Grandmaster, remember that you're Mr. Yan now.

130
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,040
Say to her, "I'm not worthy
of such devotion from you."

131
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,840
I'm not worthy of such devotion from you.

132
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,480
"I'm a jerk. A scum."

133
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,340
"Nothing but an animal."

134
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,440
I'm a jerk. A scum.

135
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,640
Nothing but an animal.

136
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,840
"So, forget me,
and go find a better man."

137
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,120
Forget me, and go find a better man.

138
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,540
Huan.

139
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,120
I can stop coming to see you.

140
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,120
I won't disturb you anymore.

141
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,540
But can you tell me why?

142
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,700
Why have you suddenly become so cold,

143
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,140
as if I were a stranger?

144
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,920
Silly, that's exactly how every jerk acts
when he dumps a girl.

145
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,600
Silly, that's exactly how every jerk acts
when he dumps a girl.

146
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,580
You don't have to say that line, Grandmaster.

147
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,820
Huan, I don't understand what you're saying.

148
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,540
There were too many people around just now.

149
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:14,500
Actually, I had
something important to tell you.

150
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,760
Our daughter was born last month.

151
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,680
This poor child doesn't have a name yet.

152
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,240
Will you give her a name?

153
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,160
What's that to me?

154
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,160
Huan.

155
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,200
Where's Nian Jiu?

156
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,140
I sent him a message.

157
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,960
Wasn't I supposed to stay
as an otter for three months?

158
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,480
The Form-Changing Pill works
according to my will.

159
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,520
Whenever I want, I can use it.

160
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,040
But you're now a dead person.

161
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,180
So, you should still appear as an otter in front of others.

162
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,660
All right.

163
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,020
Huan.

164
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,600
By the looks of it,

165
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,620
Mr. Yan is indeed an irresponsible jerk.

166
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,720
What exactly does "jerk" mean?

167
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,720
A man who abandons his wife and child

168
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,820
and should be pounded into pulp.

169
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,720
Perhaps he will be.

170
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,720
What do you mean?

171
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,860
Smashed into pieces

172
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,580
and ground into dust.

173
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:58,640
 I have a feeling
Grandmaster's cooking up something big. 

174
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,120
 

175
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,080
Mr. Yan has returned!

176
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,980
- Quick!
- Quick!

177
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,780
Mr. Yan.

178
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,020
You...

179
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,120
Who are you?

180
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,340
Why did you transform into me?

181
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,360
Because there's something
about you that interests me.

182
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,360
What do you want?

183
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,100
Are you going to catch me back there again?

184
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,800
Someone! Father!

185
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,400
Have you forgotten, Mr. Yan?

186
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,280
Your father went to the neighboring city
on important business.

187
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,460
He won't return for a month.

188
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,300
All right. Get lost.

189
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,050
Yes, sir.

190
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,620
Wh-Who are you people?

191
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,780
Never ever try to fight against Grandmaster.

192
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,120
Just give up, jerk.

193
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,860
The flame-shaped birthmark on your back,

194
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,360
where did it come from?

195
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,340
I don't know.

196
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,560
I honestly don't know.

197
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,640
- Speak.
- I don't want to go back there.

198
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,920
I don't want them to go there either.

199
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,800
It's so frightening. So disgusting.

200
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,360
Grandmaster, he seems to have PTSD about this birthmark.

201
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,380
What?

202
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:12,520
Just hearing about the birthmark triggers his traumatized memory

203
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,440
and drives him into madness.

204
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,340
Not even the Truth Spell works on him.

205
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:36,420
 Mr. Yan, the Master asks that you rest
at the 16th concubine's quarters tonight. 

206
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,880
 You're not going anywhere from now on. 

207
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,120
 Stay home and give me heirs. 

208
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,980
 That son of the Yan family
takes concubine after concubine, 

209
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,220
 yet never studies for the imperial exams. 

210
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,940
 He spends his days drinking in brothels. 

211
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,040
 There's no difference between him
and keeping worthless trash. 

212
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,620
 Well, you're just jealous he was born with a silver spoon. 

213
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:01,080
 If this keeps going on,
he'll wind up down and out. 

214
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,580
I can't get anything out of him.

215
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,620
The Soul Search can't help either.

216
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,840
Looks like the memory traumatized him badly.

217
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,900
He's a good-for-nothing.

218
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,100
Patience.

219
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,460
We'll see if we can find clues elsewhere.

220
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,080
Don't worry.

221
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,480
We can kill a few people in this residence,

222
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,220
and they'll tell us the truth.

223
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,220
That won't do, Grandmaster.

224
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,900
We still have much to find out.

225
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,700
Besides, you're wearing this jerk's face,

226
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,560
you have to tread carefully.

227
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,040
A little impatience will spoil our plan.

228
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,160
Goodness!

229
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,880
This frigging Mr. Low-Stamina

230
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,520
has enough wives for a football team.

231
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,460
Mr. Yan.

232
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,380
Mr. Yan, you haven't visited me in so long.

233
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,740
Mr. Yan, when will I get to see Xian?

234
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,420
I've barely seen him since he was born.

235
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,820
- Right.
- Mr. Yan.

236
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,700
Let go.

237
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,070
- Mr. Yan.
- Mr. Yan.

238
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,500
Could you turn me back
into human form, Grandmaster?

239
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,220
I need to go out.

240
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,960
Why?

241
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,260
I bet Ms. Qing Er still has no idea

242
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,420
Mr. Yan has taken a dozen concubines.

243
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,940
I must tell her so she'll give up on him.

244
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,420
Weren't you the one who always
wants to do nothing?

245
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,860
Why take trouble now?

246
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,580
I'm not lazy.

247
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,140
I'm just relaxed.

248
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:03,220
The point is, those concubines are such a pain.

249
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,540
It's worse if Ms. Qing Er keeps coming to you.

250
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:08,680
I should handle this trouble for you.

251
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:13,520
Fine, then. Go on.

252
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,520
If Zhou Qing Er has any clues
about the flame-shaped birthmark,

253
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,600
report back to me.

254
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,160
He's a workaholic.

255
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,240
All right.

256
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,820
That's a compliment.

257
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,620
How much for this embroidery?

258
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,880
Five wen.

259
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,880
And the white one?

260
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,640
Show us the white one.

261
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,920
That's also five wen.

262
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,580
Same price?

263
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,340
I think the red one is prettier.

264
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,860
Thank you.

265
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,500
Ms. Qing Er.

266
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:14,020
You're Huan's new concubine, aren't you?

267
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,540
I saw you in his carriage.

268
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,980
I have nothing to do with Mr. Yan.

269
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,300
I came because I saw
how he treated you the other day.

270
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,900
I thought it was unfair.

271
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,040
He has taken too many concubines now.

272
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,500
Just days ago, he took another.

273
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:33,740
Heed my advice, leave that faithless scoundrel.

274
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,680
You don't know.

275
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,620
Huan isn't the kind of man you say.

276
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:46,520
When we first met,
we sincerely liked each other.

277
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,970
 Which one do you like? Tell me. 

278
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,420
 Cui, do you like this one? 

279
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,360
 Jeez. 

280
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,850
 The good ones are inside. 

281
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,940
Ms. Qing Er, you've been fooled by him.

282
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,980
Why still hang on to someone like him?

283
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,460
I took some silver from Yan Huan.

284
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,400
Take your child and start over somewhere else.

285
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,540
Did Huan give you this to pass to me?

286
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,500
No. He...

287
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,060
Yes, you can think of it this way.

288
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,320
Miss, I won't take this money.

289
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,880
I can stop seeking him out.

290
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,940
But if he won't explain to me in person,

291
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,140
I'll never leave.

292
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,260
Wake up, Ms. Qing Er.

293
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:06,280
Huan once wrote me poems.

294
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,040
"We entrust our affection to the clear moon."

295
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,480
"Let the breeze carry you away forever."

296
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:18,340
We also recited poems together

297
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,500
and played the guqin on a boat.

298
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,020
I don't believe this.

299
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:28,760
I don't believe everything
just ends up like this without reason.

300
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,300
Don't cry.

301
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,820
- There...
- Ms. Qing Er, I just want to ask this.

302
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:46,260
Do you know about the flame-shaped birthmark
on Yan Huan's back?

303
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,020
I do.

304
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:54,460
Has he ever told you about that?

305
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,020
Never.

306
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,240
All right.

307
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,320
- Don't cry.
- That birthmark is truly a hard secret to dig.

308
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,320
There...

309
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,180
Your face tells me things didn't go well.

310
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,780
I spoke with Ms. Qing Er.

311
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,680
She knows Yan Huan
has a flame-shaped birthmark,

312
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,360
but she has no idea what it means.

313
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,840
Then we have to find clues elsewhere.

314
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,360
And Ms. Qing Er is a hopeless romantic.

315
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,100
No matter how I try to warn her, she refuses to believe that Yan has failed her.

316
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,040
What is "hopeless romantic"?

317
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:54,600
It's an illness in which one

318
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,100
only cares about romance and nothing else.

319
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:06,060
Do you suffer from this illness?

320
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,480
Me?

321
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,620
Of course not.

322
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,300
I can barely manage my own affairs.

323
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,420
Good.

324
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:21,600
Love is the most useless thing in this world.

325
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,540
You can't put it that way.

326
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,780
A true and beautiful relationship
can give people great strength.

327
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:34,600
Only people with poor cultivation
would think so.

328
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:45,340
Considering the environment he grew up in,

329
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,320
it's normal that he doesn't believe in love.

330
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,520
Not resting yet?

331
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,020
I know otters are cute,

332
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,930
but it doesn't have to appear so often.

333
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,900
I'd like to stroll the market tomorrow.

334
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,960
Can you turn me back into human form?

335
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,740
You chatter too much.

336
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,720
I'm trying to rest.

337
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:30,900
Grandmaster, please.

338
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,480
Don't fall asleep yet, Grandmaster.

339
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,620
Not again.

340
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,300
Care to buy a body pillow?

341
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,060
It's cheap.

342
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,260
I already have one here.

343
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,460
Why would I need another?

344
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,020
 The soul-tracking firefly 

345
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,740
 shows me that Nian Jiu's last trace 
 

346
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,080
 is at Yan Residence. 

347
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,280
 Sima Jiao and Ting Yan must be here, too. 

348
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,810
Let's go shopping.

349
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,160
It's Ru Ling!

350
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,600
Miss, has a young lady
entered your household lately?

351
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,600
Do you mean Mr. Yan's new concubine?

352
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,120
Concubine?

353
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,660
No. The one I'm looking for is about this tall.

354
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:31,960
She's slender and beautiful.

355
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,120
Ru Ling must be here for me.

356
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,060
No, I haven't seen her.

357
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,540
Thank you.

358
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,700
Ru Ling.

359
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,320
Ru Ling.

360
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,360
Where did this little spirit come from? Don't get in my way.

361
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,520
Wait for me, Ru Ling!

362
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,820
 Nian Jiu was clearly last found here. 

363
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:30,340
Could it be... Could it be that Ting Yan's already...

364
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,660
You little spirit.

365
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,780
Why is it you again?

366
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,096
 

367
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,400
What does that mean?

368
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,400
I'm Ting Yan.

369
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,560
 Ting Yan? 

370
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,380
It can't be.

371
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:03,660
On Stargazing Terrace, Ting Yan gave me fruits, and we enjoyed the view.

372
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,700
You really are Ting Yan?

373
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,520
Ting Yan!

374
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,120
Oh, finally, my friend.

375
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,680
I understand now.

376
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,720
Grandmaster is trying to protect you this way

377
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,610
so you can avoid trouble
from the Eight Palaces.

378
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,200
But it truly frightened me when I saw your life lamp go out.

379
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,980
It's always good to have friends.

380
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,940
Ru Ling.

381
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,880
Ru Ling, it's really you.

382
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,040
What brings you here?

383
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:40,960
I came seeking Ting Yan,
so I happened to stop by here and found her.

384
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,960
You found Ting Yan?

385
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,560
Where's she?

386
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,380
- You don't know yet? 
 - No.

387
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:57,860
Don't worry. She's safe now.

388
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,040
That's a relief.

389
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,620
Looks like you two are tight.

390
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,900
Grandmaster.

391
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,680
I told Liao Ting Yan
to keep this secret from everyone.

392
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,520
She trusts you so much.

393
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,060
Forgive me, Grandmaster.

394
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:21,480
I worry for Ting Yan and came looking for her.

395
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,080
Ting Yan couldn't bear to see me upset,
so she told me.

396
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,880
If you say a word about her whereabouts...

397
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,100
Please don't worry, Grandmaster.

398
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,840
I will keep it to myself.

399
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:36,720
Grandmaster, Ru Ling,
you know where Ting Yan is,

400
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,580
why won't you tell me?

401
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,520
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

402
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,300
Why don't you figure it out yourself?

403
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,780
Figure it out myself?

404
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:57,920
Say, Ru Ling, now that we meet again,

405
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,200
are you ready to begin the lessons?

406
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,520
Lessons?

407
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:07,200
Have you forgotten? You promised
to teach me how to behave like a human.

408
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,800
No, I haven't.

409
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,340
So, in the first lesson,

410
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,040
you've just taken human form and still carry your beastly nature.

411
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,160
Though it can be brutal,

412
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:25,720
it also makes you lower your guard and obey unconditionally.

413
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,160
You're too sincere and kind.

414
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,040
That won't do you any good.

415
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,020
What should I do?

416
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:42,160
Ru Ling. Teach me, please.

417
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,880
Miss, we have great tube whistles.

418
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,200
Come have a look. Which one do you like?

419
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,020
Come have a look.

420
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,160
You have keen eyes, miss.

421
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,880
This tube whistle has an excellent tone.

422
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,720
- How much? 
 - Only 100 gems.

423
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,040
- 100 gems. 
 - Yes.

424
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,760
Wait.

425
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,800
I can tell this tube whistle

426
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,240
was bought in bulk from South Mountain.

427
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,920
It's worth no more than ten gems.

428
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,440
Ten gems.

429
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,120
Miss, you should take this one instead.

430
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,880
Ten gems for you.

431
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,000
Ten it is.

432
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,690
No. I'll lose money. No way.

433
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:25,360
Wait. You can have this for ten gems.

434
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,400
All yours.

435
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:36,040
There you go. Master, this is my gift as a disciple.

436
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:39,720
The sound of this whistle travels a hundred li.

437
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,440
If I call for you with it, you'll hear me even from afar.

438
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:49,660
All right. If you need me,
I can appear by your side anytime.

439
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,960
Thank you, Nian Jiu.

440
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,480
You see, human minds are complicated.

441
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,760
Full of traps.

442
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,960
If you ever come across a situation like with the whistle peddler,

443
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,980
never agree so easily like you did just now. Understood?

444
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,860
How should I refuse them?

445
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,980
I'll teach you.

446
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:20,740
You can refuse politely by saying, "This doesn't look right."

447
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,280
This doesn't look right.

448
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:27,800
If the other person insists, you say, "I don't have the time."

449
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,520
I don't have the time.

450
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:35,900
If they still insist, you can be more direct and give a firm refusal.

451
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,740
"No, I can't."

452
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,840
Oh, I see.

453
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,680
It's the same when Grandmaster
usually says, "Get lost", right?

454
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:50,640
Yes, but that's the ultimate form of rejection.

455
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,460
This doesn't look right. I don't have the time.

456
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:58,280
No, I can't. Get lost.

457
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,980
I think I've got the hang of it.

458
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:04,560
I didn't teach you the last one.

459
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,000
This doesn't look right.

460
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,720
No, I can't. I don't have the time.

461
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,989
 

462
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:20,080
 

463
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,880
You're indeed a jerk.

464
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,160
You haven't even settled things
with Ms. Qing Er,

465
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,880
and now you're messing with Zhou Yue Qing.

466
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,880
I'm going to teach you a lesson.

467
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Yue Qing.

468
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,520
Yue Qing.

469
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,960
Yue Qing.

470
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,160
Yue Qing.

471
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,760
Hold on.

472
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:44,800
 Our daughter was born last month. 

473
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,920
 This poor child doesn't have a name yet. 

474
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,360
 Will you give her a name? 

475
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:54,480
 Huan once wrote me poems. 

476
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,220
 "We entrust our affection to the clear moon." 

477
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,480
 "Let the breeze carry you away forever." 

478
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,440
Clear moon, breeze, Zhou.

479
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,180
My, my! This name is...

480
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,520
Yue Qing.
(T/N: Moon and breeze)

481
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,840
Grandmaster, I think I've discovered
something important.

482
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,940
What's it?

483
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:23,780
Yan Huan really likes Ms. Qing Er.

484
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:31,260
You rushed here just to tell me Yan Huan's love story?

485
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:34,480
I just saw him
giving Ms. Qing Er's child a name.

486
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,320
Even if he truly likes her, so what?

487
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,280
Grandmaster, think about it.

488
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,000
For someone like Yan Huan,
who bluffs and flirts a lot,

489
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,800
if he really liked her, why wouldn't he marry Ms. Qing Er?

490
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,180
Why would he go to such lengths
to cut ties with her?

491
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,920
Perhaps he has his own reasons,

492
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,780
and it might have something to do
with the flame-shaped birthmark.

493
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,560
Mr. Yan!

494
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,000
Mr. Yan, the 12th concubine
threw herself into the well!

495
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,920
What?

496
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,640
Luckily, she was saved.

497
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,120
Take me to her.

498
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,860
Mr. Yan, she's here.

499
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,940
My Xian!

500
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,860
Mr. Yan!

501
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:21,240
Mr. Yan, please let me see my son.

502
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,320
Mr. Yan, if I weren't desperate to see my son,

503
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,840
I wouldn't have risked my life, Mr. Yan.

504
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,200
I'm begging you.

505
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,560
Please.

506
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,640
Please let me see him.

507
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,800
Mr. Yan, I miss my child, too.

508
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,480
Mr. Yan.

509
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,360
Where's her son?

510
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,760
I don't know, sir.

511
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,840
The Master and you never allow us to ask about the children.

512
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,960
It seems like something's wrong
with this Master Yan.

513
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,500
Oh, right, Grandmaster.

514
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,560
We've overlooked something.

515
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,640
With so many concubines in the Yan Residence,

516
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,160
there's no child here at all.

517
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,640
I'm begging you, Mr. Yan.

518
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,040
There's still one person who has a Yan child.

519
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,040
Ms. Qing Er.

520
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,740
I saw Ms. Qing Er here last time.

521
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:26,520
She said she lives nearby.

522
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,560
Huan!

523
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:36,200
- What's wrong, Ms. Qing Er?
- S-Someone took our child away.

524
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,840
- When did this happen?
- Just now.

525
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,280
I was playing with the child in the courtyard.

526
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,080
Then, I went inside to get her a pellet drum.

527
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,920
But when I returned, the child was gone.

528
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,580
What should we do?

529
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,840
I'll find her.

530
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,400
But the streets are full of people.

531
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,120
We don't know where the culprit went.

532
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,800
How do we find the baby?

533
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,500
Follow this light stream.

534
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,040
We should be able to find the baby.

535
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,360
This way.

536
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,840
You! Return the child!

537
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,640
Get out of my way.

538
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,880
Move!

539
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,600
The baby!

540
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,300
Mr. Yan?

541
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,820
As expected of you, Grandmaster.

542
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,720
Why are you stealing someone else's child?

543
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:55,780
Do you know you'd be sentenced to death if you stole a child in my world?

544
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,600
Why are you taking this child?

545
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,680
I'm bringing her back to the household

546
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,760
and will hand her over to Master Yan
when he returns.

547
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,240
You're from the Yan Residence?

548
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,200
And what happens
after giving the child to Master Yan?

549
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,560
I don't know.

550
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:11,100
The Master only told me to watch if Mr. Yan had any children outside.

551
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,880
If he did, bring the child back.

552
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,840
That was why I was watching Zhou Qing Er.

553
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,340
I'm clueless about the rest.

554
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,480
Where's Master Yan?

555
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,980
He said he went to the neighboring city
on some matters.

556
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,460
No one knows where he is.

557
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,200
As expected.

558
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:47,140
This child has a flame-shaped birthmark.

559
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,280
Could it be that all of Mr. Yan's children

560
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,400
have a flame-shaped birthmark,

561
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:56,720
and for some reason,
the Yan family took them away?

562
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:03,280
Perhaps because these children
are of great use,

563
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,180
the Yan family made Yan Huan
marry many concubines

564
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,320
and forced him to have children.

565
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,400
This sounds exactly like...

566
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,880
 It's exactly the same
as what the Eight Palaces did. 

567
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,680
 To feed the Spirit Fire, 

568
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,540
 they first forced
Grandmaster's parents together 

569
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,620
 and then plotted to obtain his blood. 

570
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,160
The Celestial Palace is indeed childish.

571
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,520
They always use the same trick.

572
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,580
Nothing new.

573
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,480
My child!

574
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,840
Thank you, miss. Thank you, sir.

575
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,280
Who took my child?

576
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,280
Was it a human trafficker?

577
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,180
It's someone from the Yan family.

578
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,600
The Yan family?

579
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,120
Why is that?

580
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,480
We don't know.

581
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:11,400
Ms. Qing Er, I asked you
about the flame-shaped birthmark,

582
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:16,200
but why didn't you tell me
your daughter had it, too?

583
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,540
Do you know anything about it?

584
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,320
I truly didn't know.

585
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,360
I wasn't trying to hide it either.

586
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,920
Huan...

587
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:35,800
I asked Huan before
about the flame-shaped birthmark,

588
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,840
and he suddenly became agitated,

589
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,320
as if it were an ill omen.

590
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,600
When I later gave birth to my daughter,

591
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,780
she also had the same mark.

592
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:48,760
I knew Huan wouldn't like it,
so when you asked,

593
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,960
I pretended I didn't know.

594
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:01,900
Looks like we can only
find out the truth from Master Yan.

595
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:13,000
Grandmaster, tell her
the daughter's name is Yue Qing.

596
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,820
Me?

597
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,980
I'm here, darling.

598
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,200
I've come up with a name for her.

599
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,920
Yue Qing.

600
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,720
Zhou Yue Qing.

601
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,880
Yue Qing...

602
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,720
"We entrust our affection to the clear moon."

603
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,800
"Let the breeze carry you away forever."

604
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,620
It's from a poem Huan wrote for me.

605
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:48,880
I suppose he still cares for me.

606
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:53,240
Yue Qing, this is the name
your father gave you.

607
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,070
Do you like it?

608
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,200
Yes?

609
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:10,780
 E, Give our child a name. 

610
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,660
 Let him be called Jiao. 

611
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:35,740
So what if she has a name?

612
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,120
Even with a name,

613
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:46,560
she will still bring disaster.

614
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:51,360
Grandmaster, don't say such frightening things.

615
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,160
No matter what dangers lie ahead,

616
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,500
Yue Qing has a mother who loves her the most.

617
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:13,780
I won't let her face the world alone.

618
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:28,360
Sir, Miss, although I don't know
our true identities,

619
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,170
thank you so much.

620
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:34,180
You can tell he's not Yan Huan?

621
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,800
You saw through my illusion?

622
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,520
I know nothing about spells.

623
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,640
But I spent so much time with Huan before,

624
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,840
and I'm familiar with his every move.

625
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:51,080
I wasn't sure at first,

626
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,100
but over time,

627
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:58,080
and after you cast a spell to locate the baby,

628
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,660
I knew you weren't him.

629
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,270
Grandmaster.

630
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,110
True love can break spells.

631
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:15,780
In that case, she can use true love
to break the Yan family's fate.

632
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,280
He didn't mean that.

633
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,020
We'll continue looking into the Yan family.

634
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,120
Thank you, Miss.

635
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,680
Thank you, Miss.

636
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,680
Thank you, Miss.

637
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,580
Thank you, sir.

638
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,260
Grandmaster.

639
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:47,060
So, does the Yan family
have a blood relation with you?

640
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:49,900
Otherwise, why would all this happen?

641
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:53,420
Yes. I suspected there was some relation

642
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:56,940
between the flame-shaped birthmark
and the Fengshan line.

643
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,760
Just when I entered the town,

644
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,440
I located Yan Huan using blood resonance.

645
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,320
For over 500 years,

646
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,400
I'm the only one left of the Sima Clan.

647
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:14,800
I didn't know the blood could sense each other.

648
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:20,600
That was why I used blood resonance
to find the child.

649
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,760
But why is there the Fengshan bloodline here?

650
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,580
The Fengshan Clan has always
pursued bloodline purity.

651
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,200
But over the years,

652
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,460
some have defied their elders, run off,

653
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,160
and had children with outsiders.

654
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:44,920
Shi Qian Lv has gone to great lengths
to gather people of the Fengshan bloodline.

655
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,540
He is playing a long game.

656
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:16,900


657
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:24,680

 ♫ Moon and stars dapple the sky ♫ 

660
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:32,720
 ♫ Brushing the loneliness of bygone days ♫ 

661
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,780
 ♫ Candlelight flickers low ♫ 

662
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,720
 ♫ Shadows sway ♫ 

663
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,780
 ♫ Shimmering in the night ♫ 

664
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,760
 ♫ With a brush I draw ♫ 

665
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,720
 ♫ The color of light ♫ 

666
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,720
 ♫ To warm your frozen soul ♫ 

667
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,660
 ♫ Memories anchor here ♫ 

668
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,720
 ♫ Longing is engraved ♫ 

669
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,180
 ♫ Yet cannot be touched ♫ 

670
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:58,340
 ♫ Following ♫ 

671
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,880
 ♫ The veins of gravel ♫ 

672
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,660
 ♫ I turn into spirit fire ♫ 

673
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:06,540
 ♫ Burning away ♫ 

674
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:11,920
 ♫ All these karmic ties ♫ 

675
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,820
 ♫ To save you ♫ 

676
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:16,840
 ♫ To save me ♫ 

677
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:20,800
 ♫ To cross over all suffering,
I'll break through ♫ 

678
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,840
 ♫ The laws of heaven ♫ 

679
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,700
 ♫ The vortex of reincarnation ♫ 

680
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:28,820
 ♫ What of life and death? ♫ 

681
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:30,800
 ♫ To save you ♫ 

682
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,800
 ♫ To save me ♫ 

683
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,580
 ♫ To redeem all beings, I'll let pass ♫ 

684
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,720
 ♫ Right and wrong ♫ 

685
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,700
 ♫ Rumors and tales ♫ 

686
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:44,360
 ♫ To seize fate ♫ 

687
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:48,120
 ♫ With my own hands ♫ 

688
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,820
 ♫ For you ♫ 

689
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:52,780
 ♫ For me ♫ 

690
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:56,740
 ♫ For the healing of wounds ♫ 

691
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:58,760
 ♫ I'll stir the murky seas ♫ 

692
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,780
 ♫ And strive against the heavens ♫ 

693
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:04,620
 ♫ To protect the vastness ♫ 

694
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,720
 ♫ For you ♫ 

695
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,700
 ♫ For me ♫ 

696
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:12,640
 ♫ For the light of dawn ♫ 

697
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,780
 ♫ I'll face promises ♫ 

698
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,700
 ♫ Like a moth to a flame ♫ 

699
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:28,938
 ♫ And use my body to shine on even more ♫
