1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I can't get back what I lost.

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Shi Qian Lü

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,900
is so hardworking to find the Fengshan Blood S

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
is a big deal.

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But Shi Qian Lü, he collected the blood

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
what can he do?

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
For the personal desire.

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I've said it before.

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The people of the Geng Chen's house are the same.

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
For the cultivation, they can do anything.

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We just need to find out

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
where Shi Jia took the kids.

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Then we can know his real plan.

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But the only person who knows about this

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
is that Master Yan.

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Then we can only wait for him to come back.

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
After all, no one knows his whereabouts.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Why should we wait?

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
He came back to see me.

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Please tell us.

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Using the identity of Yan Huan

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
to destroy Yan's house.

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Old Yan will come back.

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The puppet is used as a counter.

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Someone is scheming to get past it.

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
How is it?

41
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Am I still alive?

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Actually, I pretended to be a wolf in the wind and moon.

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The people in the house still don't want to let me go.

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm already dead.

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm not a ghost.

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I can't just die in the open.

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You'd rather live in a cage

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
than die with dignity.

49
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You're right.

50
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I also want to kill Bai Yao.

51
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Is it that simple to die?

52
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You've never experienced my pain.

53
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You won't understand.

54
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
After everything is over,

55
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'll help you understand everything.

56
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Then this is the best.

57
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So you want to create a serious chaos

58
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
and bring Old Master Yan back in advance?

59
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Bring him back?

60
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'll follow the plan of the Group 10.

61
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's a big project.

62
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I think in a short time,

63
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
we won't have a day like this.

64
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Ting Yan, you're saying something

65
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I don't understand.

66
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Don't mind the details.

67
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That video is good.

68
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
How is it? I'll change another one.

69
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
This one is good.

70
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Is it?

71
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
That person is Ye Ru Ling.

72
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
How did she appear here?

73
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
The woman beside you looks like Liao Ting Yan.

74
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Isn't Liao Ting Yan dead?

75
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Let's go and see.

76
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
If these two are compared, which one should I choose?

77
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'll choose this one.

78
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'll go and see.

79
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What's wrong? What are you looking at?

80
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Nothing.

81
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Ting Yan, this hairpin is very beautiful. I like it.

82
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Help me choose. I'll be back soon.

83
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Oh no, it's the family.

84
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm back.

85
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Cang Lan, why are you here?

86
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
If I don't follow you here,

87
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I won't be able to wait for you to tell Liao Ting Yan that she's still alive.

88
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You used the shadow bug to track me?

89
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Don't you dare to hurt Liao Ting Yan.

90
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I believe that there will be a way to make it better.

91
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You're so soft-hearted.

92
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You even want to save your clan?

93
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Ye Ru Ling, the whole country will be in chaos.

94
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Let's see who will be the final winner.

95
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What are you doing?

96
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm just in case you do something wrong.

97
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Do you know that if Sima Jiao finds out about this,

98
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
we will all end up in a mess?

99
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Come on, let's go.

100
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Hello, Mr. Li.

101
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You're finally here.

102
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I was waiting for you.

103
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Young Master, you're here.

104
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Go away.

105
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Young Master.

106
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Stop.

107
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Young Master.

108
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Go away.

109
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
What are you doing?

110
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Young Master, it seems that we've got the wrong person.

111
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Did I really do something wrong?

112
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Let's go.

113
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I finally got away from the past.

114
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Why did I become a water tower?

115
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It seems that the Ape is here too.

116
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm back.

117
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Grand Master, did you save me just now?

118
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Are you hurt?

119
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
No, no.

120
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's lucky that you're here.

121
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Even if I become a water tower,

122
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I would be found out by the Shi family.

123
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's hard for me to escape.

124
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
What happened today is a little strange.

125
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm afraid someone has exposed your whereabouts.

126
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Who was with you just now?

127
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I went out by myself.

128
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Ru Lin went with me.

129
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You're really too reckless.

130
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
How dare you lie to me.

131
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm afraid that I said it.

132
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Do you suspect Ru Lin?

133
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
After all, she is Princess Yintze.

134
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's very likely that she has a connection with the Shi family.

135
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
No.

136
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm afraid that she's not the one.

137
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's impossible for her to be connected with the Shi family.

138
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
No.

139
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Ru Lin will definitely not betray me.

140
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I believe her.

141
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Besides, it's not a big deal.

142
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And it's the only way.

143
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's not a big deal.

144
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I saved your life.

145
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I gave your blood.

146
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
If you're in danger of being hurt,

147
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
it's my blood that's wasted.

148
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You think I wasted your blood.

149
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You're so mean.

150
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You know to scare me.

151
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
By the way,

152
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
don't you like to lie?

153
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Let's see how you can lie to me now.

154
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Sima Jiang, you shut down the truth.

155
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Young Master, then my brother Xian...

156
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Let's go.

157
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Give some reaction.

158
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I will find out their whereabouts.

159
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Thank you, Young Master.

160
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Thank you, Young Master.

161
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Thank you for restoring my freedom.

162
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Young Master must have known our pain.

163
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
That's why he let us leave.

164
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Today is my rebirth day.

165
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I will be your wife.

166
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I will make this day my rebirth day.

167
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I will take this moment to welcome you.

168
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Great.

169
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Your pink clothes make you look a little black.

170
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Even if I touch it, it will not tell the truth.

171
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's not good for me.

172
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You're so rude.

173
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You can't judge my clothes.

174
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Sorry.

175
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Young Master, can you solve the truth quickly?

176
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Even if the people of Chiyan City are weak,

177
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
they can't see my magic formation.

178
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
But if I keep talking like this,

179
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
they will feel strange.

180
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Maybe...

181
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
They will eat me up.

182
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Do you know?

183
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I said it's a punishment.

184
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
If someone wants to take me to jail

185
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
and beat you up,

186
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
it's not a good thing.

187
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
What kind of little school girl's behavior is this?

188
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It seems that you are very satisfied with my words.

189
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You call me a little school girl.

190
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Little school girl is not a compliment.

191
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm talking about your childish, boring, and unreasonable...

192
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Liao Ting Yan, shut up.

193
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
If so,

194
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
you can continue to scold me.

195
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I dare not.

196
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I dare not.

197
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Don't you want to hear the truth?

198
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You see, you solved it for me.

199
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
No matter how many words I say,

200
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I will tell you.

201
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
How boring the fake Feng Cheng is,

202
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I don't like to hear it.

203
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Greetings, Young Master.

204
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Young Master, can I stay?

205
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I have no one to rely on.

206
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I am willing to stay at Yan's house to serve you day and night.

207
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
No need.

208
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm not used to having someone with me.

209
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Am I right?

210
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I think you are used to it.

211
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Didn't you hold me last night to sleep?

212
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So the young master took us away

213
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
because of this girl.

214
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
That's right.

215
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I just want to keep her alone with me.

216
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Are you happy?

217
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I can't talk about happiness.

218
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
But I'm very surprised.

219
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
What is this?

220
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It's not written in the script.

221
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I think you are angry.

222
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You are talking nonsense.

223
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Miss, it's like this.

224
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I am actually a water tower.

225
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
He is not really Mr. Yan.

226
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I...

227
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
What he means is

228
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I don't want to be a water tower anymore.

229
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I don't want to be a water tower anymore.

230
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I don't want to be a young master of Yan's family anymore.

231
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I want to live according to my own thoughts.

232
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I understand.

233
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I will bless the young master and the girl for the rest of my life.

234
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
See?

235
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
If you don't untie me,

236
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
you will be punished by the world.

237
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It will ruin your great plan.

238
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I don't know what great plan.

239
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I only know that someone called me a little school girl.

240
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
The truth will be revealed in five days.

241
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Are you cursing me in your heart?

242
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Yes.

243
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Then add five more days.

244
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You are so stupid.

245
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You are so stupid.

246
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I don't want to be a water tower anymore.

247
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You want to use the way of the people to return to the body of the people.

248
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You want to trap me here.

249
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You reflect on yourself here.

250
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Don't think about sharing the Yang Biao with me.

251
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I will find a way to gain the trust of Sima Jiao as soon as possible.

252
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I won't let our plan fail.

253
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
A way?

254
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You have been in Chiyan City for many days.

255
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You haven't found any way to move the body of Liao Ting Yan's body.

256
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I am right, right?

257
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Sister, don't lie to yourself anymore.

258
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Now we have no way to go except to take Liao Ting Yan's internal order.

259
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
There is one more way.

260
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Kill Sima Jiao.

261
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You are so naive.

262
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Sister, who is Sima Jiao?

263
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You have no chance to win.

264
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
We will have a chance.

265
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Sister, you must be clear about it.

266
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Grand Master.

267
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I am here.

268
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I am here.

269
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Did you tell the world about Liao Ting Yan's whereabouts?

270
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I didn't tell anyone about it.

271
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Why did you come to the city to find us?

272
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I was worried about Ting Yan's safety.

273
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I didn't want to believe that you would kill him.

274
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
So I came up with a plan.

275
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I found the traces of Ting Yan.

276
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Please forgive me.

277
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
If I knew you had a second heart, I would kill you.

278
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I dare not.

279
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I don't know what you are going to do today.

280
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
First, you disband the concubine.

281
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Then you call all the family members of the family.

282
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It's so scary.

283
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Miss.

284
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I heard from the housekeeper that you like you a lot.

285
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
We are all servants.

286
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Can you help me say a few words in front of you?

287
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Let me be a steward.

288
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I will help you if I need it.

289
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Thank you, brother.

290
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Brother, you look like a martial arts master.

291
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'm only in my early twenties.

292
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm sorry.

293
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I saw you were in your late twenties.

294
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I thought you were in your fifties.

295
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I'm sorry. I'm really disobedient.

296
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I don't care about you for the sake of the young master.

297
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You are really not a good person.

298
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Miss.

299
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Your throat is broken.

300
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I think you are too tired.

301
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You should rest. I'll go to work.

302
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Thank you.

303
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Can you stop talking to me?

304
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You offended me so much in such a short time.

305
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Excuse me.

306
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Be gentle.

307
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Master.

308
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
What do you mean?

309
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
What?

310
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
The effect is good.

311
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It's just a word.

312
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You don't have to answer if you can't hear it.

313
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Interesting.

314
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Diao Ting Yan.

315
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I don't care if you are praising me or scolding me.

316
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I can't hear it.

317
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
There are wings behind you.

318
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You don't think you are so handsome, do you?

319
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Are you sincere?

320
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Do you want to trick me?

321
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I just reminded you.

322
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
There are wings behind you.

323
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
If you don't listen to me,

324
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
what can I do?

325
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You are really trying hard to find me a way to have fun.

326
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
In order to trick me,

327
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
you are working hard today.

328
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
If you want to play,

329
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I will accompany you to the end.

330
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Do you still want to play?

331
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
No.

332
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Pull me up.

333
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
No.

334
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Let's go and play with the housekeeper.

335
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Master.

336
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Master's belongings are all here.

337
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Go to the money house and take them all out.

338
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
This...

339
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Tell the servants outside

340
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
to pick out the things in the houses in the yard

341
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
and leave the house.

342
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Master.

343
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Those are all the treasures that Master cares about the most.

344
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
This...

345
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Yes.

346
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
What is the childe doing?

347
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I don't know where Master is.

348
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
No.

349
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I have to send someone to spread the news immediately.

350
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I hope Master can receive the news and come back quickly.

351
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I have to take it.

352
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
These boxes are neither jewelry nor gold.

353
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Why are they the most popular?

354
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Miss.

355
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
You don't know that.

356
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Our city is low in magic.

357
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And Master Yan is very good at the immortal magic.

358
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
So he collected these magic weapons from the immortal houses.

359
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Magic weapons?

360
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Yes.

361
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Look at this.

362
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
This is the pass.

363
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
This is the mirror.

364
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Look.

365
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It can reflect the other party's immortal magic.

366
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And this is called the good luck tree.

367
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
As long as you engrave the names of the two people on this tree,

368
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
they will be in love.

369
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I have been a fan of the flower shop for a long time.

370
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I plan to engrave the names of the two of us.

371
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Flower shop?

372
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Then I think you don't deserve it.

373
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You... you are too much.

374
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm sorry.

375
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I don't want to say it either.

376
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
You... you listen to my apology.

377
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I am sincere in my apology.

378
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I don't want to hear it.

379
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
When did Si Ma Jiao stop the real words?

380
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
The mirror?

381
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Si Ma Jiao.

382
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Let's talk.

383
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
What do you want to talk about?

384
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
How long do you want me to be fooled by the real words?

385
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Can you please help me solve it?

386
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It really caused a lot of trouble to my life.

387
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Then you know your mistake.

388
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Why did you lie to me?

389
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I have explained it.

390
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I have my own concerns.

391
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Why do you have to force me to tell the truth?

392
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I just want to have some space for myself.

393
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
What's wrong?

394
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
If a person is even heard from the inside,

395
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
how tired he is to live?

396
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:18,300
I hate the false

397
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,000
and false expectations of others.

398
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I treat them with lies.

399
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
No one can hide it from me.

400
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I'm not a man.

401
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I'm not a man.

402
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You're a man.

403
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Master,

404
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I know that you are surrounded by lies.

405
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I know that lying makes you feel lonely.

406
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
And me?

407
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I came to this world.

408
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Everything here makes me feel strange.

409
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
No one understands my thoughts.

410
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Even if time is all gone.

411
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Actually, we are all lonely.

412
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
But can we not use this way

413
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
to understand each other's feelings?

414
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
There are many ways to know a person's true heart.

415
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Love is too crazy.

416
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Open up the heart.

417
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
You understand.

418
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
So,

419
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
don't punish me anymore, okay?

420
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
You make me feel so uncomfortable

421
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
for fun.

422
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
In your opinion,

423
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I do this for fun.

424
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Or what?

425
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
For your big picture,

426
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
everything is not going to fail.

427
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I'm sorry.

428
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
The most annoying thing is

429
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
what you said

430
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
is all your true thoughts.

431
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Or you can tell me your true thoughts.

432
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I want to hear the truth.

433
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Because

434
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I'm serious about you.

435
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I don't want you to be hurt.

436
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Love is too crazy.

437
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Open up the heart.

438
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
You understand.

439
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
If you dare to use this kind of

440
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
mortal thing to fool me,

441
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I'll let you sit in the water for the rest of your life.

442
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
What does that mean?

443
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Or he has some

444
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
unfulfilled thoughts about me?

445
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
No, no, no.

446
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
He can't fall in love with others.

447
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
But his eyes

448
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
are too sincere.

449
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
So annoying.

450
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
You're drunk.

451
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Impossible.

452
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I'm not drunk.

453
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I just drank one cup.

454
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
How could I be drunk?

455
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
You used to be a human.

456
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Now you're a water tower.

457
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Your drinking capacity is different.

458
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
All of these

459
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
are for yourself?

460
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Or what?

461
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Forget it.

462
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I was going to celebrate

463
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
our liberation.

464
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
You should eat some too.

465
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
What are you doing?

466
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Hugging and sleeping.

467
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
You always hug me

468
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
and sleep in the water tower.

469
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
What?

470
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Are you shy?

471
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Yes.

472
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Who's shy?

473
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
None of the political matters can stop you.

474
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Did you cut my hair?

475
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Thanks, dear master.

476
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I've finally

477
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
lost all my feelings.

478
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Feelings?

479
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,040
Actually, we are all lonely.

480
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:01,040
But can we not use this method to understand each other's feelings?

481
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,040
In my head,

482
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,040
it's like I'm possessed by some kind of ancient monster.

483
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,040
Could it be that I've changed to what he said?

484
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,040
Love party?

485
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,040
In Qinggu Tian,

486
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,040
is it only you who likes to write and write?

487
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:20,040
What kind of love is it?

488
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,040
Dear,

489
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,040
it's a name that is suspected by the elders.

490
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,040
I usually use it to call my close ones.

491
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:32,040
You can also use it to call the most annoying fake customers.

492
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:40,040
There are many ways to know a person's true heart.

493
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,040
Do you treat me as the first one

494
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,040
or the second one?

495
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,040
I must hate you.

496
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,040
I'm not lying to you.

497
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,040
It's true.

498
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,040
Are you uncomfortable?

499
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,040
No.

500
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,040
Drink this.

501
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,040
Don't wake up.

502
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,040
I'm too lazy to drink it myself.

503
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,040
Come on.

504
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,040
Why did I become a human?

505
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,040
What's wrong with you?

506
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,040
I'm just a child.

507
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,040
I am not a child.

508
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I'm a human.

509
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I'm a human.

510
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I'm a human.

511
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I'm a human.

512
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I'm a human.

513
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
You...

514
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Why are you smiling so happily at me?

515
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,560
Si Ma Jiao is still that stubborn.

516
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,560
Master, where are you going?

517
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,600
Kill someone.

518
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,680
Is it you who is talking too much?

519
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,160
Master, don't be impulsive.

520
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,120
You came to kill me?

521
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,720
Exactly.

522
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,400
No, no.

523
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,600
Master, please let me talk.

524
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,080
No.

525
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,720
What are you doing?

526
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,120
Master,

527
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,920
the person you want to kill is Mr. Yan?

528
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,560
What's wrong?

529
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,720
I think the son's death

530
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,560
is the most likely thing to lead him back to the mansion.

531
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,720
Can we not be so bloody?

532
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,240
Be more gentle and gentle.

533
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,520
Doing this

534
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,360
is not a relief for him.

535
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,360
How can death be a relief?

536
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,000
Is there no other way?

537
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,360
What do you want to do?

538
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,000
We can stop him from being a birth control tool.

539
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,960
Isn't that good?

540
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,000
How about we promote him to elope with his mother?

541
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,120
This is also equivalent to

542
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,320
preventing the Yan family from cultivating Fengshan bloodline.

543
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,880
Mr. Yan can go back to the mansion.

544
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,000
You want to use this

545
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,400
to pull Mr. Yan out of the mud pool.

546
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,560
I advise you to be careful.

547
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,000
Don't do anything that will cost you your life.

548
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,200
I believe

549
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,320
we can do it.

550
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:24,720
Master,

551
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,480
trust me.

552
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,640
You really don't have the courage to turn back.

553
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,600
I'll know when I try.

554
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,040
I'll go help my mother prepare.

555
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:43,960
Did you hear that?

556
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,240
Mr. Yan has dismissed all his concubines.

557
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,240
He even gave each concubine a large sum of money.

558
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,240
He even gave each concubine a large sum of money.

559
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,480
That's true.

560
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,080
No, no.

561
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,880
It's a perfect match.

562
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,360
Not only that,

563
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,560
Mr. Yan also divided the money between the servants

564
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,840
and dismissed the servants.

565
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,680
Really?

566
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,640
I'm telling you.

567
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,240
Isn't this a mess?

568
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,840
Which mess did you say this is?

569
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,520
Why is Mr. Yan suddenly so chaotic?

570
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,320
It's true.

571
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,800
Did you hear that?

572
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,240
Did you hear that?

573
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,680
Mr. Yan was planning to

574
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,240
elope with the concubine of the flower house he had secretly met.

575
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,640
He abandoned everything in the Yan family for him.

576
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,280
There's such a thing?

577
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,360
That's right.

578
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,480
When Mr. Yan comes back,

579
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,640
he'll be able to see you.

580
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,400
That's right.

581
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,800
What are you doing?

582
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,000
I heard that you were making a scene outside.

583
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,960
You lost all your money,

584
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,680
and even dismissed the concubine.

585
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,640
And a woman eloped with the flower house.

586
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,800
You're so careless.

587
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,200
How am I supposed to keep you in the dark?

588
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,520
What's the matter?

589
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,640
It's a serious matter.

590
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,640
I'm just telling you.

591
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,640
I'm just telling you.

592
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,640
I'm just telling you.

593
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,640
I'm just telling you.

594
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,640
I'm just telling you.

595
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,640
I'm just telling you.

596
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,280
Tell me.

597
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,640
You actually forgot about my wife?

598
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,880
You bastard!

599
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,080
It's all because those wild women outside

600
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,480
have made you so mad.

601
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,480
I'm telling you.

602
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,320
From now on,

603
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,320
you're not allowed to go out.

604
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,880
I'm going to get you some concubines

605
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,480
and give birth to more children.

606
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,360
Otherwise,

607
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,320
there won't be a good day in the Yan family.

608
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,080
Who will provide you with a good life?

609
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,760
Who are those children for?

610
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,320
You...

611
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:43,920
You...

612
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,640
You're going to a place like the flower house

613
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,240
and screw up your brain.

614
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,240
From the moment you entered,

615
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,440
you didn't even call me father.

616
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,640
You're still a bastard.

617
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,040
If I call you father,

618
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,240
I'm afraid you're not blessed enough.

619
00:35:59,240 --> 00:35:59,840
You...

620
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,040
Who are you?

621
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,240
You're not my son.

622
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,920
I'm your ancestor.

623
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,920
You're just a child.

624
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,920
How dare you humiliate me?

625
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,920
What's the matter with the fire-bomb birthmark

626
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,520
on Yan Huan?

627
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,320
The Yan family

628
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,520
and Sima clan are of the same family.

629
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,920
Every generation of the Yan family

630
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,920
will have a person

631
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,920
with Sima clan blood.

632
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:40,120
There will be a fire-bomb birthmark behind it.

633
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,320
What will you do with these people?

634
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,120
Once such a child appears,

635
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,520
he will be sent directly to that place.

636
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,720
If the child's blood vessels are strong,

637
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,520
he will stay there directly.

638
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,920
Our Yan family will naturally get many benefits.

639
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,720
If the blood vessels are weak,

640
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,520
just like my son Yan Huan,

641
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,920
he can return to his own home.

642
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,520
Where is that place?

643
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,120
Bai Feng Mountain.

644
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,920
Where is it?

645
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,320
I don't know.

646
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,520
There will be a cultivator to pick us up.

647
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,920
We can't get close.

648
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,920
We can only wait outside.

649
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,120
If I want to go to Bai Feng Mountain as soon as possible,

650
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,320
what method is there?

651
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,520
We can only wait.

652
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,520
It's always the cultivator from Bai Feng Mountain to contact us.

653
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,320
At the end of every month, the cultivator from Bai Feng Mountain

654
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,520
will come to the house to check if there are any blood vessels.

655
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,320
If there are any children in the house,

656
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,320
the cultivator from Bai Feng Mountain will check

657
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,320
if there are any descendants of the Feng clan blood vessels.

658
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,720
If there are no blood vessels,

659
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,320
he will directly bring them to Bai Feng Mountain.

660
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,720
I will follow his lead.

661
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,720
Don't we only need one child?

662
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,120
No problem.

663
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,720
Have you memorized all the things I taught you?

664
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,920
I've been practicing even while sleeping.

665
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,520
Senior.

666
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,320
Nian Jiu, control Master Yan first in the house.

667
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,920
Then go do something else.

668
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,320
A late refusal can mean...

669
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,120
This...

670
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,120
This is not good.

671
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,720
What did you say? What's wrong with doing things for me?

672
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,120
If the other party asks again, you can continue to play tricks.

673
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,120
It can mean...

674
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,920
I'm not convenient.

675
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,520
If I want you to be convenient,

676
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,520
you can be more direct and clearly refuse him.

677
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,720
I still won't.

678
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,920
Nian Jiu, is there nothing you miss in this world?

679
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,720
What kind of honey-trap medicine did you give him?

680
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,720
I know my mistakes.

681
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,120
I...

682
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:56,720
I'm just teaching Nian Jiu some tricks to bring people to pick up things.

683
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,320
Teach him how to betray the Grand Master.

684
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,920
I dare not.

685
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,120
You are so stingy.

686
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:05,520
Grand Master, this really has nothing to do with Ru Ling.

687
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,520
I'm the one who is pestering Ru Ling to learn how to be a person.

688
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:14,120
In the first class, Ru Ling taught me how to learn to refuse others.

689
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:17,720
Because I thought I can't be like before.

690
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:22,520
Like a pet, I'm always obedient to everyone.

691
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,920
Humph.

692
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,520
You're learning from him.

693
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,720
Why don't you come to me to learn how to be a person?

694
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,520
Grand Master, let's not play tricks on Nian Jiu.

695
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,320
I'm going to find Young Master Yan.

696
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,920
Help me become a human.

697
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,920
Ting Yan.

698
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,720
You're done for.

699
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,320
This water tower is Ting Yan.

700
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,720
In a few days, I'm going to go to Mount Baifeng with Young Master Yan.

701
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,120
You go back and keep an eye on the movements of the Shi family and the Eight Great Palace.

702
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,520
If the situation is good, you can report to me at any time.

703
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,520
Yes.

704
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,720
If I make a contribution to this matter and gain the trust of the Sima Sect,

705
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,120
then no matter if I kill or use it,

706
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:13,520
it might help me break out of the Immortal Demon Plain as soon as possible.

707
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,720
Grand Master, I'll go with Nian Jiu.

708
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,920
Okay.

709
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,920
If there's any situation, report to me at any time.

710
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,520
Yes.

711
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,720
Young Master Yan.

712
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,520
Come with me.

713
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,320
Mother and your daughter are waiting for you.

714
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,720
No.

715
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,520
I'm not going.

716
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,720
I can't harm them.

717
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,520
Their mother is far away from me.

718
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,920
That's the best choice.

719
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,920
You should cheer up.

720
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,120
We've already heard your father talk about Mount Baifeng.

721
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,920
My family is...

722
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,320
My Young Master is very powerful.

723
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,320
He will definitely solve the matter of Mount Baifeng.

724
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,920
He will make sure that you won't have any more worries.

725
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,520
We've already paved the way for you.

726
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,920
You can live your life as you wish.

727
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,720
After going through such a thing,

728
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,120
can I still be at ease?

729
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,720
The blood of the Mount Fushan Clan...

730
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:40,520
will one day still drag me into this tragedy.

731
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,520
He's right.

732
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,120
I'm sorry.

733
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,120
I'm sorry.

734
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,320
I'm sorry.

735
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,320
I'm sorry.

736
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,320
I'm sorry.

737
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,320
I'm sorry.

738
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,320
I'm sorry.

739
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,320
I'm sorry.

740
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,320
I'm sorry.

741
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,320
I'm sorry.

742
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,320
I'm sorry.

743
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,320
I'm sorry.

744
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,320
I'm sorry.

745
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,320
I'm sorry.

746
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:22,320
The autumn breeze is light and the stars and the moon are scattered.

747
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:26,320
It burns through the deep loneliness.

748
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:30,320
The candlelight is weak and the shadow is shattering.

749
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:34,320
Shimmering in the dark night.

750
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:38,320
I used my pen to draw the color of light.

751
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:42,320
I warm your cold soul.

752
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,320
The memory stops.

753
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,320
The yearning is clear.

754
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:50,320
But I can't touch it.

755
00:42:50,320 --> 00:43:05,420
I look for the

756
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:10,420
I'm waiting for you to come to me.

757
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:14,420
Only to break through the bitter and bitter.

758
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:18,420
The rules of heaven are turned into a whirlpool.

759
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:22,420
What about life and death?

760
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:26,420
I'm waiting for you to come to me.

761
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:30,420
Only to lose the result in the end.

762
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:34,420
Right or wrong, the rumors are spread.

763
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:41,420
I'll live my life to the fullest.

764
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:50,420
For you, for me, for the fish in the river.

765
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:54,420
The sea is warm and the rain is pouring.

766
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:58,420
I'm the one who is being fulfilled.

767
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:06,420
For you, for me, for the sincere surrender.

768
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:10,420
Facing the promise, I will never fail.

769
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:22,420
Use my body to light up the path.
