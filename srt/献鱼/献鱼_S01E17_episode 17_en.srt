 ♫ Heavens strike with thunderous wrath ♫

 ♫ Mountains and rivers shatter before my eyes ♫

 ♫ Endless splendor
cultivated through lifetimes ♫

 ♫ Turns to dust between my fingers
in an instant ♫ 

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,220
 ♫ When the line
between good and evil is clear ♫

 ♫ Countless souls drift
into the boundless wilds ♫

 I defy fate just to remain by your side  ♫

22
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,240
Whose treasury did you rob this time?

23
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,500
Here.

24
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,990
Take this.

25
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,010
I feel all warm inside.

26
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,010
How many injuries do you still have?

27
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,890
Here. And here. Too many to count.

28
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,920
I went too easy on them earlier.

29
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,080
If I'd known they'd hurt you like this,

30
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,670
I would have made their deaths
far more miserable.

31
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,760
All right.

32
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,520
Don't be angry.

33
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,660
The important thing is we're out of danger.

34
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:10,070
Did what happened today frighten you?

35
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,900
No.

36
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,890
Not even after all that?

37
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,380
What, am I supposed to say yes?

38
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,200
Look.

39
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,240
Your wounds are healing well.

40
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,600
But I still have many internal injuries.

 ♫ Snow not gone, flame not out ♫ 

42

There is another way

43
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:02,360
to make you recover faster,

44
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,340
like when you healed me before.

45
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,010
 ♫ No one reaches, no one hears ♫ 

46
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:12,000
You mean through soul bond?

47
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,710
Not just that.

48
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,800
 ♫ No fate's tangle, no parting swans ♫ 

49

What are you doing?

60
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,460
It feels like I'm being burned alive.

61

 ♫ Snow not gone, flame not out ♫ 

62

This is the searing pain
I endure day and night.

63
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:40,780
 ♫ You, untouched by moon's regrets ♫

 ♫ No one reaches, no one hears ♫

 ♫ Thousands of stars in your eyes ♫ 

66

Don't be afraid.

67
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,200
As long as I'm here,

68
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,140
no one will ever be able to hurt you again,

69
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,480
and you won't have to
feel this kind of pain again.

70
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:12,010
If the pain is unbearable, tell me.

71
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,400
Don't hold it in.

72
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,240

74
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,200
If you ever get so gravely injured again,

75
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,980
I will kill you.

76
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,830
As if you could bear to.

77
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:41,840
Your thoughts already tell me
how much you care about me.

78

 ♫ Be it destiny or doom,

 ♫ Mad love blooms a lotus in the heart ♫ 

84
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:21,090
Madam Ye, I've brought Miss Cang Lan.

85
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,840
You finally let me out, Ru Ling.

86
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:40,650
Cang Lan, I've joined forces
with Sect Master Shi to kill Sima Jiao.

87
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,420
Really?

88
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:49,680
From the sound of it,
the Shi family is powerful but also suspicious of you.

89
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,060
You must be careful.

90
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,350
Why not let me secretly dig up leverage on them

91
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,740
so we won't be left at their mercy?

92
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,750
No need.

93
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:05,160
Just stay here and guard Yin Palace.

94
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,680
Leave the rest to me.

95
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,010
- But...
- Enough. Stop worrying about this.

96
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,110
We haven't seen each other in so long.

97
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:18,290
Let's talk about something pleasant, all right?

98
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,710
All right.

99
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,310
Come.

100
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,560
Sect Master, after recent covert surveillance,

101
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,610
we have found no sign that Madam Ye is colluding with Sima Jiao.

102
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,920
Keep watching her.

103
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,440
She cannot be fully trusted.

104
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,535
Understood.

105
00:09:35,535 --> 00:09:38,110
Also, Madam Ye's younger sister, Ye Cang Lan,

106
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,680
seems to be looking for dirt
on the Shi family to use against us.

107
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,710
She has always been willful and reckless.

108
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,540
She could endanger our plans.

109
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,560
Don't touch her yet.

110
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,540
Ye Ru Ling is a useful blade.

111
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,420
I intend to keep a firm grip on it.

112
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,922
 

113
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,790
You're awake.

114
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,790
Do you feel any better?

115
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,560
My head really hurts.

116
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,920
Where?

117
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,580
My neck hurts, too.

118
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,590
And my shoulders...

119
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,930
Your shoulders?

120
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,590
Just teasing you.

121
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,890
Where are we?

122
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,900
Fenghua City.

123
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,350
You are now Shi Yu Xiang,
mistress of this city.

124
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,090
The Shi family?

125
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,040
Have we infiltrated the enemy camp now?

126
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,960
Fenghua City is in the outer territory
of Gengchen Celestial Palace.

127
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,040
Shi Yu Xiang may belong to the Shi clan,

128
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,560
but she is not highly regarded.

129
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,020
She seems to be living quite a carefree and happy life, though.

130
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,160
She has always been arrogant and domineering.

131
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,960
She built Fenghua City herself.

132
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:21,020
People outside even call it the City of Pleasure.

133
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:25,520
You really gave me quite the role to play.

134
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:32,560
But since you've gone to such lengths,

135
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,210
how could I let your efforts go to waste?

136
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:44,780
Getting bold, are you?

137
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,870
Madam Shi, are you awake?

138
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:55,400
Ting... Madam Shi, the man outside
won't let me in!

139
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,200
What kind of racket is this?

140
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,860
If Madam Shi is interested in you, she will call you in to serve her.

141
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,230
I am her friend.

142
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,610
Hey!

143
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,040
Madam, this man claims to be your friend,

144
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,590
but I have never seen him before.

145
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,870
He is my friend.

146
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:19,850
Madam, this man is rude, plain-looking,

147
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:22,110
and even less attractive
than the one behind you.

148
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,690
Why would you be friends with him?

149
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,680
I meant he was a friend of my friend.

150
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,070
In terms of looks, of course he cannot compare
to this one beside me.

151
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,180
Ting... Madam Shi.

152
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,470
Hey, you on the bed.

153
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,830
Madam Shi is up.

154
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,350
Why are you still in bed instead of getting up

155
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,750
to fetch water and help her wash and change?

156
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,870
Tomorrow, I will send you
back to the countryside.

157
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,380
How dare you?

158
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:59,920
Since when is it your place
to tell my man what to do?

159
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,980
Please forgive me, Madam.

160
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,160
Madam.

161
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:09,190
Do you want me to serve you?

162
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,380
No. Keep lying there.

163
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,710
And you, get out!

164
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,460
Yes.

165
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:35,400
Just now, Ting Yan's demeanor
felt strangely familiar.

166
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,520
I was just copying the Grandmaster,
projecting authority.

167
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,920
When have I ever acted like that?

168
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,690
Then I must not have captured your essence.

169
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,360
Nian Jiu.

170
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,970
Ye Ru Ling is using you
more than she cares for you.

171
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,750
If you want a master to teach you how to live,

172
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,540
I can find another for you.

173
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,800
From now on,

174
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,490
From now on, you are my only master, Grandmaster.

175
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,350
Nian Jiu, I've heard
Fenghua City is quite lively.

176
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,230
Why don't we go out and explore together?

177
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,580
Sure.

178
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,490
I need to take you somewhere first.

179
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,630
Then I guess you'll have to go by yourself.

180
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,290
I'll wait.

181
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,110
Did news of the new Spirit Fire come in?

182
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,490
No.

183
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,590
But someone is going to take me to it.

184
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,440
Who?

185
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,010
Shi Qian Lv.

186
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,220
"Act as planned"?

187
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,060
Guards.

188
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,710
Master Yuan.

189
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,350
I will be away for a while.

190
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,280
You must watch the Young Master closely.

191
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,490
Understood.

192
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:34,490
Young Master?

193
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,650
I will go kill that wicked Shi Qian Lv myself!

194
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,990
- Madam Shi.
- Pick me, please.

195
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,080
Madam Shi, pick me.

196
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,100
- Pick me, Madam.
- Please choose me, Madam.

197
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,920
- Look at me.
- Pick me, Madam.

198
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,150
- Look at me.
- Madam...

199
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,210
Give me a chance, Madam.

200
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,460
- Look here, Madam.
- Pick me.

201
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,650
Please choose me, Madam.

202
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:03,040
Pick me, Madam.

203
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,590
- Choose me, Madam.
- Pick me, Madam.

204
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:10,710
Grandmaster, why did you bring me
to Shi Yu Xiang's treasure vault?

205
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:13,470
You never used magical artifacts before.

206
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,580
Why are you suddenly interested?

207
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,440
What is this for?

208
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,740
Defense.

209
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,890
Don't tell me these are all for me.

210
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,630
I'll pass on this nose ring.

211
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,320
If I really put it on,

212
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,630
my beautiful nose would fall right off.

213
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,220
This is a nose ring?

214
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,830
It's so big that it looks like
it's meant for cattle.

215
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,180
I don't want it.

216
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,440
I think it's fine.

217
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,820
I don't. No, thanks.

218
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,250
Are these really all for me?

219
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,980
Of course.

220
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,550
But I don't like them.

221
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,740
Forget it, all right?

222
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:31,960
I can already hear you
cursing me in your heart.

223
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,200
My temper has been really bad lately.

224
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,380
I'm warning you, don't mess with me.

225
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,710
What about this one?

226
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,160
Do you like it?

227
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,220
Yes, I do! This one's pretty.

228
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,030
Too bad it isn't a defensive artifact.

229
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,070
What's wrong with you?

230
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,180
Do you really have feelings for me?

231
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,470
What's this?

232
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:10,230
Pills. They don't taste bad.

233
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:13,570
They calm the mind.

234
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,180
Wow, I feel so happy.

235
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,310
 Greetings, Madam Shi. 

236
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,120
 Greetings, Madam Shi. 

237
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,070
- Madam.
- Madam.

238
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,920
Back off! Leave me alone!

239
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,550
- Please choose me, Madam Shi.
- Pick me, Madam.

240
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,900
- Madam...
- Don't you see I have one already?

241
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,940
I'm not putting on any of those.

242
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:10,030
Are you kidding me?

243
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,710
Sima Jiao, you're hundreds of years old,

244
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,810
yet you're as childish as a kid!

245
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,680
 Why is it suddenly thundering? 

246
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,620
 Even the weather is in a foul mood. 

247
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:45,232
 

248
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,700
- Who goes there?
- How dare you damage our spiritual peak?

249
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,220
Father, another spiritual peak
has been destroyed.

250
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,360
Who did it?

251
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,960
Someone at quite a high realm.
Our disciples couldn't catch him.

252
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,470
But the spells he used

253
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,750
carried traces of Sima Jiao's spiritual power.

254
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,850
So, Sima Jiao was behind it?

255
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,750
He's searching for our Spirit Fire?

256
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,620
Yes, and that's what worries me.

257
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,070
By the way, Father,

258
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,640
about the spy you told me to investigate,

259
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,230
after looking deeper,

260
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,900
I discovered someone
who should have already been dead.

261
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,030
Who?

262
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,420
Yuan Shang.

263
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,660
Yuan Shang?

264
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,250
He's not dead?

265
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,620
No.

266
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,880
If Yuan Shang is still alive,

267
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,400
then in the failed siege
at the Luo River Immortal District,

268
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,770
the traitor wasn't Ye Ru Ling.

269
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:12,660
Are you saying you suspect Yuan Che?

270
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,790
Sima Jiao knew we were going after Yuan Shang,

271
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:21,680
so he deliberately set a trap for us

272
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,160
to win Yuan Che over and use him.

273
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,200
Father, then we can also use Yuan Shang

274
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,570
to turn Yuan Che into our spy.

275
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:36,440
Ever since the Baifeng Mountain fire,

276
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,160
Sima Jiao has been gravely weakened

277
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,640
and has become everyone's target.

278
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,070
And yet. Yuan Che still follows him so loyally.

279
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:46,050
This man is useless to us.

280
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,030
Then should we just kill him?

281
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,470
All you know is killing.

282
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:52,620
And yet you even failed to kill Yuan Shang!

283
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,530
No need to kill him.

284
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,960
Sima Jiao's whereabouts are elusive.

285
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,230
I've been fretting over how to track him down.

286
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:09,180
Perhaps this is just the opportunity I need.

287
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,530
 It really is a bit heavy. 

288
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,570
Grandmaster, Yuan Che has sent a message.

289
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,810
Look.

290
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,550
 The plan is underway.
Please await further news. 

291
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,490
Shi Qian Lv is about to take the bait.

292
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,230
Grandmaster, are you
making artifacts for Ting Yan?

293
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:06,840
I heard thunder outside.

294
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,510
Is Ting Yan about to undergo tribulation?

295
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,750
You've gotten smarter.

296
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:14,710
So, you brought her to Fenghua City

297
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:17,200
because of the tribulation artifacts

298
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,200
and the Thunder Valley,

299
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,030
which can help her survive, right?

300
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,840
But Ting Yan's tribulation should only be

301
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,200
36 thunderbolts.

302
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,920
With her cultivation and your support,

303
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,680
she'll survive them easily.

304
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:37,600
Why are you going to such trouble?

305
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,270
Because I will not be with her.

306
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:41,200
Why not?

307
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,380
The way of heaven has always been
against the Sima clan.

308
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:50,380
If I stay by her side,
she'll only be in greater danger.

309
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,050
Isn't this a storage artifact?

310
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,420
How did it turn into a defensive one?

311
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,980
Did you make this yourself?

312
00:24:55,990 --> 00:25:00,840
Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine...

313
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,070
Just how many layers
of defensive seals are there?

314
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,700
Have you finished counting?

315
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,440
Forget it.

316
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,940
There are so many. I won't need all of them.

317
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,270
There will always be times like last time

318
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,880
when I am not by your side.

319
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,470
After thinking it through,

320
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:27,640
I decided a defensive artifact is the best way

321
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,900
to keep you unharmed in the face of danger.

322
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:34,250
I won't be in danger anytime soon.

323
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,510
You will be needing it very soon.

324
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,980
Why?

325
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,160
Why do you always leave things unsaid?

326
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,840
Now I can't even sleep.

327
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,620
Sima Jiao...

328
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:06,070
I haven't done anything bad.

329
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:08,250
Why do I feel so uneasy?

330
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,790
Jiao, something's off about the thunder.

331
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,180
Jiao!

332
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,680
I really feel uneasy.

333
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,180
I've never felt this way
during a thunderstorm before.

334
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:28,680
You are about to break through
to the Void Forge stage,

335
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,490
so there will be a thunder tribulation.

336
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:39,570
No wonder I've been so restless lately.

337
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,790
So, you gave me this defensive artifact
because you were worried

338
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:45,250
I'd be struck to death by lightning.

339
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,400
Am I going to be the first Soulshift cultivator

340
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,980
to be killed by lightning?

341
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,990
As long as I don't let you die, you won't die.

342
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:02,060
All right. I know you're mighty.

343
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:08,160
But maybe you should
keep your distance for now.

344
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,620
I'm not ready to face
the thunder tribulation yet.

345
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,880
Stop touching me!

346
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:28,460
- You...
- You're going to face it now.

347
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:37,102
 

348
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,980
We're here.

349
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,470
All right.

350
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:00,810
Do you know why I chose Shi Yu Xiang?

351
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,460
Because you wanted to be my boy toy?

352
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,570
She is also a Soulshift cultivator

353
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,220
close to a breakthrough.

354
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,440
What a coincidence.

355
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,270
But what does that have to do with me?

356
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:20,470
Thunder Valley once belonged to the Sima clan

357
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,050
and could help with tribulation.

358
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:26,990
But now, only the Shi clan
can enjoy this privilege.

359
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:30,140
So, this is the protective shield
you found for me?

360
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,530
Go inside yourself.

361
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,380
He's really sending me in alone?

362
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:45,470
I was trained by exam-oriented education.

363
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:48,050
The best thing it gave me
was psychological endurance.

364
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,140
Relax.

365
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:00,600
With my aptitude and spiritual roots,

366
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,640
the tribulation for
going from Soulshift to Void Forge

367
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,790
should only be 36 thunderbolts.

368
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:07,470
Thunder Valley can weaken the strikes.

369
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:10,920
And I have Jiao's
overpowered defensive artifact

370
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,620
and my own cultivation to shield me.

371
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,640
It's just 36 bolts of lightning.

372
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,490
Piece of cake.

373
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,380
Already starting?

374
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,180
It's like the thunder
wants to blast me into dust.

375
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,360
I'm not facing 36 thunderbolts.

376
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,160
I'm facing 81 thunderbolts!

377
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,400
Isn't that supposed to happen
only when a Grand Ascend cultivator

378
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,270
is about to become immortal?

379
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:45,220
Why would I,
a Soulshift cultivator, be facing this?

380
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:00,400
This isn't a tribulation.

381
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,900
This is a death sentence.

382
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,640
Am I really going to be

383
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,680
the first Soulshift cultivator
to be killed by lightning?

384
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:13,850
If I get blasted to pieces here,

385
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,700
Jiao will never forgive himself.

386
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:24,050
I should probably put up a fight.

387
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,740
Sit still.

388
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,380
You will be fine.

422
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:02,140
Didn't I tell you to sit still?

423
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,660
Why didn't you listen?

424
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:11,280
Sima Jiao, my heart is racing.

425
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,190
I don't know if it's because
the thunder tribulation was too terrifying

426
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,250
and I'm still shaken,

427
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,850
or if it's because
you are taking my breath away.

428
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:44,060
Is it impossible to have
a moment of romance with you?

429
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:00,320
All that noise just now...

430
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,700
Won't it draw attention?

431
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,360
A thunder tribulation here

432
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,330
doesn't cause any visions outside.

433
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,240
If I take proper care of it,

434
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,660
even if the wound heals slowly,

435
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,190
it should be fully recovered in ten days.

436
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,880
You prepared this especially for me?

437
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,190
Of course.

438
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:48,370
You're my pretty boy, aren't you?

439
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,880
I don't want bandages. They're troublesome.

440
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,550
Stop. I just applied medicine.

441
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,670
If it's not wrapped,
the wound will split open easily.

442
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:10,150
Just for one day. That's it, okay?

443
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:13,100
Once it closes up a little,
we'll take the bandages off.

444
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,660
Please. I'm really worried about you.

445
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,590
Just keep them on.

446
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:24,610
I've put on the Yingluo necklace you gave me.

447
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:26,920
I've prepared these especially for you.

448
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,360
If you don't use them,
my efforts will all go to waste.

449
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,220
Please?

450
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:36,700
Do you think I can't tell you're playing cute?

451
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:42,840
So what if you can tell?

452
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,140
You're still enjoying it, aren't you?

453
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,990
 If it were anyone else
who was at such a high realm, 

454
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:59,700
 such a wound would heal quickly
after a few pills. 

455
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,890
 But not for Sima Jiao. 

456
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,850
Don't worry.

457
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,660
I won't die before you do.

458
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,140
Sima Jiao.

459
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:26,800
Do you know you carry a faint scent

460
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,100
of the Bloodseal Bloom?

461
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:33,630
It's like it seeps out from your blood.

462
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:34,970
Is that so?

463
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:42,220
Am I the only one in the world
who can smell your scent?

464
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,850
You went out of your way to bring me here

465
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:15,020
and made such a
powerful defensive artifact for me.

466
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,590
Did you foresee that this tribulation

467
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,450
wouldn't be so simple?

468
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,500
Yes.

469
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,410
Because you carry

470
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,620
my aura.

471
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:43,140
The way of heaven rejects the Sima clan.

472
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,360
It wants me dead.

473
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,360
It is my aura clinging to you

474
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,970
that caused you to go through 81 thunderbolts.

475
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,190
I had planned to stay far from you

476
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,670
during your tribulation

477
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:58,890
so that you could maybe have it easier.

478
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,450
But unfortunately,

479
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,620
heaven wouldn't even spare my aura.

480
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,580
How vicious heaven is,
targeting your whole clan.

481
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,100
Are you scared?

482
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,590
Afraid I might bring you down with me?

483
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:18,410
Of course not.

484
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,720
But thunder tribulation is such a hassle.

485
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,450
I'd rather not
advance my cultivation too quickly.

492
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,360
 ♫ With a brush I draw ♫ 

493
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,320
 ♫ The color of light ♫ 

494
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:34,320
 ♫ To warm your frozen soul ♫ 

495
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,160
 ♫ Memories anchor here ♫ 

496
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,520
 ♫ Longing is engraved ♫ 

497
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,720
 ♫ Yet cannot be touched ♫ 

498
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:44,240
 ♫ Following ♫ 

499
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,640
 ♫ The veins of gravel ♫ 

500
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,360
 ♫ I turn into spirit fire ♫ 

501
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,240
 ♫ Burning away ♫ 

502
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:58,320
 ♫ All these karmic ties ♫ 

503
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,520
 ♫ To save you ♫ 

504
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,560
 ♫ To save me ♫ 

505
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:06,440
 ♫ To cross over all suffering,
I'll break through ♫ 

506
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,680
 ♫ The laws of heaven ♫ 

507
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,480
 ♫ The vortex of reincarnation ♫ 

508
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,640
 ♫ What of life and death? ♫ 

509
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,440
 ♫ To save you ♫ 

510
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,400
 ♫ To save me ♫ 

511
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,280
 ♫ To redeem all beings, I'll let pass ♫ 

512
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,320
 ♫ Right and wrong ♫ 

513
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,400
 ♫ Rumors and tales ♫ 

514
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,320
 ♫ To seize fate ♫ 

515
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:33,720
 ♫ With my own hands ♫ 

516
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,520
 ♫ For you ♫ 

517
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,680
 ♫ For me ♫ 

518
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:42,240
 ♫ For the healing of wounds ♫ 

519
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,360
 ♫ I'll stir the murky seas ♫ 

520
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,680
 ♫ And strive against the heavens ♫ 

521
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:50,240
 ♫ To protect the vastness ♫ 

522
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,320
 ♫ For you ♫ 

523
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,200
 ♫ For me ♫ 

524
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:58,040
 ♫ For the light of dawn ♫ 

525
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,120
 ♫ I'll face promises ♫ 

526
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,400
 ♫ Like a moth to a flame ♫ 

527
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:09,560
 ♫ And use my body to shine ♫ 

528
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:14,200
 ♫ On even more ♫
