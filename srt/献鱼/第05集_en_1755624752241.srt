1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

2
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

3
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

5
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Princess Ying,

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
why haven't the elders of your palace

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
come out for so long?

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Did I say it right?

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The spiritual power of the Grand Master

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
is not weak.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Everyone,

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
please be patient.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Just wait for the news.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Do you remember

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
how I taught you?

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's best to forget the past.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Do it.

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Do it!

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Why do you have to force me?

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Boss,

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
why are you still touching the words?

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I killed someone.

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I killed someone.

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The spiritual power is really weak.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Good chance.

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
How can you steal it?

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Princess Xin,

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
aren't you going in with me?

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Leader Shi,

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm afraid that

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
you can't go in with me.

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm afraid that

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
you can't go in with me.

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm afraid that

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
you can't go in with me.

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm afraid that

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
you can't go in with me.

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You are the guardian of the Grand Master.

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You didn't go in.

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
How can I act rashly?

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You have experienced

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
the whole process

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
of the Grand Master being sealed.

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You know how strong he is.

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Is it true that

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
the spiritual power of the New Moon Night

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
will be weakened?

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I don't know.

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
But I believe that

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
the Grand Master

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
will not be killed by the fish.

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Grand Master,

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Grand Master,

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
wake up.

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Grand Master, Grand Master,

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
wake up.

77
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Grand Master.

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's so noisy.

79
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Are you okay?

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Are you scared?

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Of course I'm scared.

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I didn't even kill the chicken.

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I let them kill me when I came up.

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Why did you come here yourself?

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Don't worry.

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
This is the necessary moment

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
to unseal the seal.

88
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What do you mean?

89
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The show is about to start.

90
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Grand Master,

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
why are you injured like this?

92
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Grand Master, are you okay?

93
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The one beside Grand Master,

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
you.

95
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Go check his pulse.

96
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Why him?

97
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I haven't learned the Chinese medicine.

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Why are you sighing?

99
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Seeing him like this,

100
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I think he's really dying.

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
That's right.

102
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm seriously injured.

103
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
My spiritual power is almost exhausted.

104
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I think you also found out

105
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
and came here.

106
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Everyone is here.

107
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Great.

108
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
My life is here.

109
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Come and take it.

110
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Grand Master,

111
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
where did you get the enemy's flag?

112
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
We just avoided you and me from dying.

113
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Are we going to die together?

114
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I won't let you die.

115
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You won't die.

116
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Si Ma Jiao,

117
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
you're still acting like this

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
in such a situation.

119
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
We sent our disciples

120
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
to serve you with kindness.

121
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
But you killed them for no reason.

122
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
What's the reason?

123
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What did you do?

124
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You locked me up for 500 years.

125
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I can't remember it.

126
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The old man who sealed me

127
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
only has you three left.

128
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Of course.

129
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm not even a human yet.

130
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
How can I get rid of the hatred in my heart?

131
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
At this time, you're still pulling the hatred.

132
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You're really a great ancestor.

133
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I really admire you.

134
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Everyone,

135
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
did you hear that?

136
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Si Ma Jiao is going to

137
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
fight with us.

138
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Tonight, we'll work together

139
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
to solve him.

140
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
If we don't kill him tonight,

141
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
no one can escape.

142
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You're so stupid.

143
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You're really stupid.

144
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
If I die,

145
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
no one can

146
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
provide the spirit fire anymore.

147
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Have you thought it through?

148
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
After you die,

149
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
we'll take over

150
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
the body of your body

151
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
and the blood lotus.

152
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
We'll naturally avoid it.

153
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
We'll take the responsibility of the ancestors.

154
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The blood lotus you said

155
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
is a porcelain.

156
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
We're trapped.

157
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Si Ma Jiao wants to use our eight great masters

158
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
to come here

159
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
and use our blood to remove the seal.

160
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Hurry up.

161
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Where are you going?

162
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's the spirit fire.

163
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
We can't get out.

164
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Grand Master,

165
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm afraid this is a misunderstanding.

166
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
We have no evil intentions.

167
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
At least, our Tian Zhi Palace

168
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
has no ill intentions towards you.

169
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You're right.

170
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Your New Moon Night's

171
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
weakness is a lie.

172
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I just realized

173
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
that it's too late.

174
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Fight him!

175
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Si Ma Jiao,

176
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,340
you're a

177
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
devil.

178
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Si Ma Jiao,

179
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
you can't die.

180
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Si Ma Jiao,

181
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
you're a traitor.

182
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You didn't think that

183
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
you'd miss

184
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
a star lotus.

185
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Only the blood of the eight great masters

186
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
can be removed.

187
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You're right.

188
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
We can't let the spirit fire

189
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
get away.

190
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
We can't let the spirit fire

191
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
get away.

192
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
We can't let the spirit fire

193
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
get away.

194
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
We can't let the spirit fire

195
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
get away.

196
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That star lotus

197
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
is usually as timid as a rat.

198
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
But now,

199
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
your plan is out of control.

200
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's a great achievement.

201
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
How do you know

202
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
that my plan

203
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
is out of control

204
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
when he's alone?

205
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'll definitely

206
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
use the people

207
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
you sent in.

208
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Si Ma Jiao,

209
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
you're a

210
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
devil.

211
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You can't die.

212
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You can't die.

213
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You can't die.

214
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You can't die.

215
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You can't die.

216
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You can't die.

217
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You can't die.

218
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You can't die.

219
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You can't die.

220
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You can't die.

221
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You can't die.

222
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You can't die.

223
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You can't die.

224
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You can't die.

225
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You can't die.

226
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You can't die.

227
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You can't die.

228
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You can't die.

229
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You can't die.

230
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You can't die.

231
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You can't die.

232
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You can't die.

233
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You can't die.

234
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You can't die.

235
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You can't die.

236
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You can't die.

237
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You can't die.

238
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You can't die.

239
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You can't die.

240
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You can't die.

241
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You can't die.

242
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You can't die.

243
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You can't die.

244
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You can't die.

245
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You can't die.

246
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You can't die.

247
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You can't die.

248
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You can't die.

249
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You can't die.

250
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You can't die.

251
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You can't die.

252
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You can't die.

253
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You can't die.

254
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You can't die.

255
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You can't die.

256
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You can't die.

257
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You can't die.

258
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You can't die.

259
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You can't die.

260
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You can't die.

261
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You can't die.

262
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You can't die.

263
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You can't die.

264
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You can't die.

265
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You can't die.

266
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You can't die.

267
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You can't die.

268
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You can't die.

269
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You can't die.

270
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You can't die.

271
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You can't die.

272
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You can't die.

273
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You can't die.

274
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You can't die.

275
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You can't die.

276
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You can't die.

277
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You can't die.

278
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You can't die.

279
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You can't die.

280
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You can't die.

281
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You can't die.

282
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You can't die!

283
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,920
If rereavers look for us or follow us,

284
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,840
이름 will naturally donate themselves to us.

285
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,020
Uncle.

286
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,520
Are you okay?

287
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,840
I have faced heaven's höyne

288
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I will never forget the promise we made in the past.

289
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:43,000
All the regrets I have made,

290
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
they will never be forgotten.

291
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I will never forget the promise we made,

292
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I will never forget the promise we made.

293
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I am not alone, I am never alone.

294
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
No matter how the world changes,

295
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I will never forget.

296
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Granduncle, are we breaking the seal?

297
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
That's right.

298
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
That's good.

299
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
The seal is actually unsealed.

300
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It's true.

301
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
The spiritual power was failed is fake.

302
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
There must be a plot behind the Lion's rumour.

303
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It must be a trap.

304
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Stop talking.

305
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Go and have a look.

306
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm sure it's a trap.

307
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Go and have a look.

308
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Go and have a look.

309
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Go and have a look.

310
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Go and have a look.

311
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Go and have a look.

312
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Go and have a look.

313
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Go and have a look.

314
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
They set out.

315
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Go and have a look.

316
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Go, go have a look.

317
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's really weird.

318
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
See how their enormous power

319
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
is days away from their true form.

320
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,500
It's really weird.

321
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,780
It's really weird.

322
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,600
Your medicine is so delicate.

323
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,600
What?

324
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,000
I think you might be

325
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,600
so hungry that you're being locked up for so long.

326
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,400
You're right.

327
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,000
The pain I've suffered

328
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,600
must be returned one by one.

329
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,200
I didn't say that.

330
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Sir!

331
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Infatuation Poison!

332
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Master, I don't need to be buried with you.

333
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,600
You don't want to die?

334
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,000
Of course I don't want to die.

335
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I was scared to death just now.

336
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Master, I'm sorry.

337
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm sorry.

338
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Come on.

339
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Master is out of the coffin.

340
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
What?

341
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Hurry up.

342
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Welcome master out of the coffin.

343
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Welcome master out of the coffin.

344
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Liao Qingyan.

345
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
The wind is not good.

346
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It almost overshadowed the life of the immortal.

347
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Master.

348
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'll clean the back door for you today.

349
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You.

350
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Master, please forgive me.

351
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
How can you be so rude in front of me?

352
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Master, please forgive me.

353
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm just worried about you.

354
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
What are you afraid of?

355
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I've said it.

356
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
If I don't let you die, you won't die.

357
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
This disciple is from the Temple of the Four Seasons?

358
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
How can he be so kind?

359
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I've never seen this disciple before.

360
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Before the master,

361
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
he was very kind to the disciples of our Songjianshan.

362
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Why?

363
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
He left behind a disciple of Sanlin who is very skilled.

364
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
What's the use?

365
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
When he sent the disciples to the mountain,

366
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
he knew what kind of mind he had.

367
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You.

368
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Master.

369
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Today, the mountain was destroyed like this.

370
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Why don't you go to Bai Lu Cliff to stay for a while?

371
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
After the disciples have finished repairing the place,

372
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
we'll invite you back to the mountain.

373
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You want to take me back and seal it for another five hundred years?

374
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Master, you misunderstood.

375
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm...

376
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Enough.

377
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Master.

378
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You didn't run away because I saw your killing scene, right?

379
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Master.

380
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Master.

381
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
What are you thinking?

382
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Master, you can kill me if you want.

383
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Don't play with my mentality.

384
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
If you're tired from killing,

385
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
why don't you go back to wash up and sleep?

386
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'll follow your order.

387
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Master.

388
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Master.

389
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Master, what do you mean?

390
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Master.

391
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Master, what's your purpose?

392
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Boss.

393
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,600
Master, I still want to live.

394
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,600
Please don't kill me.

395
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,600
Then I'll spare your life.

396
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
This is too sudden.

397
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Sudden?

398
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I've prepared for this moment for 500 years.

399
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
With the blood of the eight great heroes,

400
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I've been able to break the seal barrier.

401
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I've always known this method.

402
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
But the problem is

403
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
how to gather the blood of the eight great heroes to unseal the seal for me.

404
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I can't get out.

405
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I can only let them in.

406
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'll train my spirit fire to be more powerful.

407
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Increase my cultivation.

408
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
What I'm doing is to light the fear in the hearts of the eight great heroes.

409
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Master, calm down.

410
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Master, calm down.

411
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
They're afraid that I'll break the seal barrier

412
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
and send people to the mountain.

413
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I admire your talent.

414
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm willing to serve you.

415
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Once the disciples of the mountain are dead,

416
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
they'll be afraid and will be afraid.

417
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm afraid you still remember the past grudges.

418
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Let's start with the wall.

419
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
You go and take the people outside the tower.

420
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I'll go.

421
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
The wall.

422
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Go and unseal the barrier outside the tower.

423
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
The mouse will follow the gap

424
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
and sneak in.

425
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And the first New Moon Night

426
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
is the most weak time for me.

427
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Those disciples who sneak out to report the news

428
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
will make the mountain master fall into the trap again.

429
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Master, the New Moon Night is the most weak time

430
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
in the past 500 years.

431
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
But it's not enough just by the rumors.

432
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
The day of the New Moon Night,

433
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
the spirit vein will weaken.

434
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
The seal barrier in the master's body

435
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
makes him unable to shoot himself.

436
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
This is not true.

437
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
You don't have to do anything today.

438
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
You just need to learn a way to kill people.

439
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Do you remember how I taught you?

440
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,700
It's best to go to the

441
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,000
place where you can't be seen.

442
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Do it.

443
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Why do you have to kill me?

444
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I'm integrated with the spirit vein.

445
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Once my heart is damaged,

446
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
the spirit vein connected to the spirit vein

447
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
will be affected.

448
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Only when the eight masters see

449
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
my weak body,

450
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
they will ignore everything.

451
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
The spirit vein is weakened.

452
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Good chance.

453
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
You will take the chance.

454
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Letting you hurt me

455
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
is the last step to make this plan successful.

456
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Then you can stab yourself.

457
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Why do you want me to do it?

458
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Those old people in the Fairy Manor

459
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
are afraid that I will be in the same place

460
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
as the spirit vein in the Fairy Manor in the Three Holy Mountains.

461
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
They put a ban on the seal on my nail.

462
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I can't stab myself.

463
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
So you have to

464
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
give me this arrow.

465
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Besides,

466
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
how can I tell the difference

467
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
without giving you this chance?

468
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
You really have no intention to harm me.

469
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
You really hate me

470
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
for using your own life as a bet.

471
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
The moon is half broken.

472
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Do you want to scold me?

473
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
No.

474
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
The candlelight is weak.

475
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
The world is in chaos.

476
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
In the dark night,

477
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
do you want to scold me?

478
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Yes.

479
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Then tell me.

480
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Murderous man.

481
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
You bastard.

482
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Are you satisfied?

483
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
You are cold and cold.

484
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Memories are clear.

485
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Missing you is clear.

486
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
But I can't help it.

487
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Then

488
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
do you want to kill me?

489
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
No.

490
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Aren't you sleepy?

491
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Go to sleep.

492
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Okay.

493
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I'll go back to sleep.

494
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Then

495
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
go.

496
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
It's right or wrong, rumors spread

497
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:10,000
The love is going to destroy the fate

498
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Another day has passed

499
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:19,000
You are for me, for the remaining of the wound

500
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
The sea is warm, the rain has stopped

501
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
The wind is blowing

502
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:35,000
You are for me, for the sincere confession

503
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Sima Jiao was sealed for five hundred years

504
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Now he is finally out

505
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Why does he look unhappy?

506
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
The late emperor's mansion must have hidden many secrets

507
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Let those people talk for a while

508
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Princess

509
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Princess

510
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Princess

511
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Princess

512
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Princess

513
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Princess

514
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Princess

515
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
This bitch wants to take the throne

516
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
What is it that can make the princess's internal energy?

517
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Are you the princess's bloodline?

518
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Is she the princess's daughter?

519
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Otherwise, how can I make her internal energy?

520
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Greetings, princess

521
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Greetings, princess

522
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Greetings, princess

523
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
From today, Yinzhi Palace is under my control

524
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
If you are not convinced, just come to fight

525
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I am not convinced

526
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Come to fight, princess

527
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Sima Jiao, you have done a good thing

528
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
She is really a strange person

529
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
She is just sleeping

530
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
She deserves to be so obsessed

531
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
What's wrong with you?

532
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
What's going on?

533
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,040
I just took a nap.

534
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,120
Why did I fall asleep?

535
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,880
I wonder when the Grand Master will be crazy.

536
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,280
To him, these people are just

537
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,840
a shadow of a building.

538
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,080
I guess I'm the same in his eyes.

539
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,440
Forget it.

540
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,520
It's fine if I can live for a day.

541
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,440
I'm just a shadow of a building.

542
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,640
I'm just a shadow of a building.

543
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,640
I'm just a shadow of a building.

544
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,640
I'm just a shadow of a building.

545
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,640
I'm just a shadow of a building.

546
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,640
I'm just a shadow of a building.

547
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,640
I'm just a shadow of a building.

548
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,640
I'm just a shadow of a building.

549
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,640
I'm just a shadow of a building.

550
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,640
I'm just a shadow of a building.

551
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,640
I'm just a shadow of a building.

552
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,640
I'm just a shadow of a building.

553
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,640
I'm just a shadow of a building.

554
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,640
I'm just a shadow of a building.

555
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,640
I'm just a shadow of a building.

556
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,640
I'm just a shadow of a building.

557
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,640
I'm just a shadow of a building.

558
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,640
I'm just a shadow of a building.

559
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,640
I'm just a shadow of a building.

560
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,640
I'm just a shadow of a building.

561
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,000
The rain falls like a sword in the sky.

562
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
The wind and the moon are the most distant.

563
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
But love can be exchanged between them.

564
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,800
Who loves me?

565
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,800
If I can't love for the rest of my life,

566
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,800
even if I can't live for the rest of my life,

567
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,800
I will still be with you.

568
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,960
I will still be with you.

569
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,960
When the blood and ink are mixed together,

570
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,960
how many souls are in the yellow night?

571
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,120
The wind blows the fire away.

572
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,120
I don't see the sweet.

573
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,120
I just want to be with you.

574
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,120
Who loves me?

575
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,120
Like the rain falling like a sword in the sky.

576
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,120
The wind and the moon are the most distant.

577
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,120
But love can be exchanged between them.

578
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,120
Who loves me?

579
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,280
If I can't love for the rest of my life,

580
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:20,280
even if I can't live for the rest of my life,

581
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,280
I will still be with you.

582
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:29,280
The land of this village has been begging me for 500 years.

583
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,280
Who loves me?

584
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:36,280
Like the rain falling like a sword in the sky.

585
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:40,280
The wind and the moon are the most distant.

586
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,440
But love can be exchanged between them.

587
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,440
Who loves me?

588
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,440
If I can't love for the rest of my life,

589
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,440
even if I can't live for the rest of my life,

590
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,440
I will still be with you.

591
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,440
I will still be with you.

592
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,440
Master, the white deer is ready.

593
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,440
Let's go.

594
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,440
Master, after the fire,

595
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:49,440
I have repaired the white deer.

596
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,440
Although the old style is gone,

597
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,440
everything is still the same.

598
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,440
Although you and this disciple are living together,

599
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:04,440
you still have to live with me.

600
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,440
I will live with you.

601
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,600
Don't worry.

602
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,600
Come here.

603
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,600
I know you don't like to be disturbed.

604
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,600
I specially selected some puppets.

605
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,600
They have no consciousness and no soul.

606
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,600
It's convenient for you to disassemble.

607
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,600
Master.

608
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,600
When you were in seclusion,

609
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,600
I couldn't help you.

610
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,600
Today, you have come out of the mountain.

611
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,600
You should be

612
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,600
given the responsibility of the Si Ma family.

613
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,600
Otherwise, the Shi family will be a blessing.

614
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,600
I don't know what to do.

615
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,600
I will be a blessing.

616
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,760
I don't know what to do.

617
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,760
Please help me.

618
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,760
Master.

619
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,760
You are willing to protect the Si Ma family.

620
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,760
But you still have to

621
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,920
leave the palace.

622
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,920
Thank you.

623
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,920
I will protect the family.

624
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,920
I will wait for you.

625
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,920
The scenery is good.

626
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,080
But I am the only one in Bailu Cliff

627
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:06,080
facing the ancestors of the Shi family.

628
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,080
I don't know how long I can live.

629
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,080
Didn't you have a good rest?

630
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,080
No.

631
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,080
Then why are you

632
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,080
not as usual today?

633
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,080
What am I usually like?

634
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,080
There are many problems and nonsense.

635
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,080
And some nonsense that I can't understand.

636
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,080
Let's go.

637
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,080
What are you thinking?

638
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,080
Do I have to die?

639
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,080
Do you want to know the reasons?

640
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,080
I just want to know the reasons.

641
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,080
The 치석 didn't get angry.

642
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,080
He is so stubborn.

643
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,080
Do you like here?

644
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,080
I like it.

645
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,680
I hate this place.

646
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,360
But this place

647
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,960
is my home after all.

648
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,520
I've seen this flower on San Shou Mountain.

649
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,400
What are you up to?

650
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,320
Let go!

651
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,560
My life was almost gone.

652
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,040
These flowers

653
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,080
are stillED as sun Irae.

654
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,120
This flower seed is a bone dated postponed flower

655
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,760
left by the Sima clan.

656
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,080
So many flowers.

657
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,160
How many people died?

658
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,920
After the death of Sima clan,

659
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,240
no body can be left.

660
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,360
Only one pearl can be left.

661
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,200
Many pearls were left before.

662
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,000
Some were scattered into the Three Holy Mountains by me.

663
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,360
The other part

664
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,800
was scattered here by me.

665
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,760
Then these flowers were bloomed.

666
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,880
It's so romantic and romantic.

667
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,520
Till now,

668
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,880
I Hasan swimming in the Five Great Mountains

669
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,960
Fetched an angel,

670
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,000
and installed it on my tie.

671
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,720
My performance on

672
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,080
the temple

673
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,720
is very impressive.

674
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,300
It contains

675
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,520
ten thousand learn from five great Islamic becomes

676
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,400
flowers being created by marcoire.

677
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,400
For example,

678
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,200
unique details

679
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,360
in this control hall

680
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:54,880
belongs to

681
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,000
the dead including the dead.

682
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,280
The flowers planted by the evil people after they died

683
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,720
are the most poisonous.

684
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,320
The flowers planted by the good people

685
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,320
are the antidote to the poison.

686
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,320
But these flowers look the same.

687
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,240
No one can tell.

688
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,120
Then is this poison a poisonous flower?

689
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,200
It seems to be nothing.

690
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,280
Oh, in this way,

691
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,960
on the night of the Three Sacred Mountains,

692
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,320
Yu Rong Rong died because of the poison in the flower.

693
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,000
People who are greedy are always unlucky.

694
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,360
Thank goodness.

695
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,360
I didn't dare to touch the flowers at that time.

696
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,920
But the poison that can't be cured

697
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,920
and the antidote that can be cured

698
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,200
are just the seed of the seed and the seed of the seed.

699
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,800
Seeing that you can still stand here now,

700
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,920
you should choose the antidote.

701
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,920
You're lucky.

702
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,320
Am I poisoned by the flower?

703
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,760
Where am I?

704
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,480
Isn't this the fire-tree of the Grand Master?

705
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,560
Fire-tree.

706
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,440
Get out of here.

707
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,560
You're so annoying when I see you.

708
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,240
Get out.

709
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,000
Even the sound is different.

710
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,920
It seems that it's not the same group.

711
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,520
Why is your temper always so bad?

712
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,800
Nonsense.

713
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,800
The timing you came is always wrong.

714
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,920
Why is he like the Grand Master

715
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,720
who feeds the flower with blood?

716
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,720
Then when I come tomorrow,

717
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,520
can I meet a time when you're in a good mood?

718
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,520
I never lied to you.

719
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,600
Who told you Si Ma clan people

720
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,920
to always annoy me?

721
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,800
So he's a clan member of the Grand Master.

722
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,600
It looks like

723
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,400
the old White Deer Cliff.

724
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,240
Si Ma E,

725
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,600
don't be so stubborn.

726
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I don't want to marry.

727
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I will never marry.

728
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,600
The pure blood of the Yanshui Fengshan clan

729
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,800
is my death's mission to feed the fire.

730
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,000
It's him again.

731
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,800
Then I should have entered his memory.

732
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,800
I don't love him.

733
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,600
Nonsense.

734
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,400
How can the family's mission be measured by the love of children?

735
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,800
You and Si Ma are the same clan but different.

736
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,400
You've been in charge of the Yanshui Fengshan clan since birth.

737
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,200
It's reasonable to get married.

738
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,200
You want to force me to get married and have a child.

739
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,200
It must be the idea of the eight grand masters.

740
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,400
Look at us now.

741
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,800
We're not like the leaders of the Gengchen clan.

742
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,200
We're just the puppets of the eight grand masters

743
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,400
who continue the glory of the Xian family.

744
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,000
This concerns the prosperity and stability of the Gengchen clan.

745
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,800
E'er,

746
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,200
don't be stubborn.

747
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,200
Get out.

748
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,400
If you don't leave,

749
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,600
I'll burn you to death.

750
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,000
It's too miserable.

751
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,200
I can't live on my own.

752
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,800
I'm also suffering from the heart attack of the Yanshui clan.

753
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
But why does the eight grand masters still force people to get married and have children?

754
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,800
If we live like this,

755
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,200
what's the difference between us and the puppets in the cage?

756
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,400
As long as I exist,

757
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,400
Si Ma Shi's fate can't be changed.

758
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,200
This is the greed of the people.

759
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,800
They force us to be desperate.

760
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,400
If one day,

761
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,600
there's no more fengshan fire in the world,

762
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,400
maybe Si Ma Shi's clan can be freed.

763
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,800
But now,

764
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,400
the grand masters are still attacking the fire.

765
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,200
Marriage?

766
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
He finally gave in.

767
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:57,660
but people are

768
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,400
Need to be willing to marry.

769
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,800
This is a wonderful thing.

770
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,400
Now it's so depressing that I can't breathe.

771
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,400
Si Ma Shi is bitten andacy by Si Ma,

772
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,940
masks

773
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:15,800
fengshan blood

774
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,040
and raise the fire of the spiritual mountain.

775
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,360
Lord Ba is really disgusting.

776
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,960
I can't imagine

777
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,920
that the Sima Clan was bullied so much by Lord Ba.

778
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,880
Where is this?

779
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,560
I'm sleepy.

780
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,280
E'er,

781
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,240
make a dream

782
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,720
for our child.

783
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,800
What's wrong?

784
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,840
Then call him Jiao'er.

785
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,560
This baby's surname is Shi Zu?

786
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,800
Why?

787
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,560
Where is the Alcohol Set?

788
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,880
Who else can accept these matters?

789
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,760
All of them belong to him.

790
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,400
Go.

791
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,040
Stop.

792
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:27,640
Obedient Youth

793
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,320
Long live Lord Ba.

794
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,280
I should have made como write if I had known.

795
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,240
What a pity!

796
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,400
??

797
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,800
I was just trying to paint that photo.

798
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,200
Oh

799
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,920
Our story Forum

800
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,560
Shimmering

801
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,200
With the brush, the color of light

802
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,320
Warm your cold soul

803
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,120
Memories stop

804
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,080
Missing clearly

805
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,720
But can't touch

806
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,880
Searching

807
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,320
The pulse in the sand

808
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,720
Becoming a firefly

809
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:17,520
Burn all the fireflies

810
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,920
You and me

811
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:26,920
Only to break through the pain

812
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,120
The rules of heaven

813
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,120
The whirling whirlwind

814
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:34,920
Life and death

815
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:38,920
You and me

816
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,920
Only to lose the result in the end

817
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,120
Is it right or wrong

818
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,120
Rumors

819
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:50,320
Gently

820
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:54,120
The fate

821
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,920
For you

822
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,720
For me

823
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:02,920
For the wounds of the fish

824
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,120
The sea is muddy

825
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,120
The rain has stopped

826
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:10,880
Contradicts me

827
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,920
For you

828
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,920

829
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:19,120
For the kokomoto of the city

830
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,120
Facing the promise

831
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,120
Ellierc Situation

832
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:27,920
Use your body to light

833
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,720
Back from back
