00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:36,620
 

20
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,440
 

21
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,870
Isn't this the cold pond?

22
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,300
The water temperature is just right.

23
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,420
 It's been so long
since I felt like I was on vacation. 

24
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,740
Wait, I can travel with my spirit sense now?

25
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,540
Looks like those pills really worked.

26
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,200
Always so vain.

27
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,300
I'll tease you about it later.

28
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,270
Why can't I get through?

29
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,820
It's dangerous there.

30
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,010
The Demon Realm is more perilous
than the Celestial Palace.

31
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,810
So, I set a protective barrier
for your spirit sense.

32
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,960
Why did it feel strangely familiar?

33
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,340
Of course.

34
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Back then, to purge the demonic poison,

35
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,880
you drank my blood and took a Bloodseal Bloom.

36
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,690
That pushed you into Soulshift,

37
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,300
and your spirit sense wandered just like this.

38
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,120
I once stumbled into my Soul Manor

39
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,740
and found your Bloodseal Bloom there.

40
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,170
Why?

41
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,980
Did that frighten you?

42
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,010
Do you know what that means?

43
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,540
I am not frightened.

44
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,340
Don't forget.

45
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,690
When you are agitated,

46
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,930
I can sometimes hear what is on your mind.

47
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,520
Right now, you are telling yourself

48
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,900
to stay calm

49
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,780
and not panic.

50
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,560
Perhaps you can feel it.

51
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,660
Even when you distance yourself from me,

52
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,830
even when you resent me,

53
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,640
you still instinctively draw close to me

54
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,100
and rely on me.

55
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,220
That's because

56
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,780
a flower of mine

57
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,660
is still blooming in your Soul Manor.

58
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,570
What...

59
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,050
What were we like with each other?

60
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,370
Just like that.

61
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,420
Like what?

62
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,340
Like what you are thinking.

63
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,340
I am not thinking about anything.

64
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,220
Have we...

65
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,320
already?

66
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,740
- What?
- You know what I mean.

67
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,130
I don't.

68
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,250
Have you been to my Soul Manor?

69
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,100
Very often.

70
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,690
 What's happening?
I'm actually picturing it in my head. 

71
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,150
 No, stop it. 

72
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:23,250
 He can probably hear my thoughts. 

73
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,810
But I have lost all of my memories.

74
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,710
Surely you have ways

75
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:59,220
to help me recover them, don't you?

76
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,030
So, why haven't you done it?

77
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:06,250
Wouldn't that get you
what you want much faster?

78
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,370
True.

79
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,580
But you deserve to move at your own pace.

103
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:13,110
 Mr. Feng Qi, let it go. 

104
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:18,160
 Besides, she seems to have forgotten
all her memories as the Frost Fish, 

105
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,820
 which is why she can't recognize you. 

106
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:25,080
 What a pity 

107
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,080
 you two have ended up like this. 

108
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,110
 I once suffered a terrible injury 

109
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,160
 and lost all my past memories. 

110
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,750
 According to Sima Jiao, 

111
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,350
 before the memory loss,
I was his cultivation partner. 

112
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,370
 She and I are cultivation partners. 

113
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,530
 You... 

114
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,010
 are nothing more than a clown. 

115
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:54,110
 Yan, it was you who saved me. 

116
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,650
 Now, it is you who has forgotten me. 

117
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,770
 The Preceptor gave me
the chance to keep living, 

118
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,410
 but you are the reason I want to stay alive. 

119
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,700
The one you should remember

120
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,460
is me.

121
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:16,820
Mr. Feng, what brings you here?

122
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,320
Mr. Ghost, please send word that I wish

123
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,010
to meet with the Preceptor.

124
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,920
Greetings, Preceptor.

125
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,350
It's been years.

126
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,010
You have grown into such a fine figure.

127
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:45,040
My Lord, please return. Leave the rest to me.

128
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,630
No need. A single fire will take care of it.

129
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:52,650
They brought it on themselves,
outshining the master and knowing no restraint.

130
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,860
 Preceptor... 

131
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,990
 This is as far as I can help you. 

132
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:26,770
 The rest depends on your own fate. 

133
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,980
Rise.

134
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:38,010
Preceptor, I will never forget
that you saved my life.

135
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,490
Think nothing of it.

136
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,960
I hear you are willing to cooperate with us

137
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,400
to help that Frost Fish recover her memory?

138
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,700
Yes.

139
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,920
May I ask, Preceptor,

140
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,700
why you are so intent
on helping me restore Yan's memory?

141
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,490
We want her to return to her former role,

142
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,080
kill Sima Jiao, and take his blood

143
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,400
to complete the blood sacrifice
for the former Demon Lord, You Yan.

144
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,890
Blood sacrifice?

145
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,080
To continue their strength and rule,

146
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,440
the ancestors of the Demon Race would have

147
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,160
their souls extracted
by the Preceptor after death

148
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,440
and infused into the bodies
of their descendants.

149
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,490
The entire ritual must be carried out
in the blood pool at White Bone Abyss.

150
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,820
So, it's called a blood sacrifice.

151
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,870
The former Demon Lord, You Yan,
was killed by the Spirit Fire.

152
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,160
So, even after all this time,

153
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,080
he still hasn't returned to life.

154
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,750
The blood in the pool has dried up.

155
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,630
To restore his soul as soon as possible,

156
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,710
we need the world's most nourishing blood,

157
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:53,590
the blood of the Fengshan Clan,
to refill the pool.

158
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:57,370
So, you want to kill Sima Jiao
and take his blood?

159
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,560
Exactly. And we need not only
a body of You clan descent

160
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,560
to serve as the vessel
for the Demon Lord's soul,

161
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,290
but also someone of the Chang family
to initiate the ritual.

162
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:16,700
Mr. Feng, will you lend us your aid?

163
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,230
It was You Chi who wiped out my clan.

164
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,400
As a descendant of the Chang family,

165
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,410
I have never wavered
in my loyalty to the Demon Race.

166
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,990
I am glad you are willing to help.

167
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:40,630
Even the slightest mistake

168
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:43,860
could make centuries
of planning all go to waste.

169
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:51,980
Still, I never imagined you'd be
so deeply attached to that little Frost Fish.

170
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,580
Preceptor, you gave me the chance to survive.

171
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:02,990
But it was Yan who gave me
the hope and courage to keep living.

172
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:06,590
I thought I would
never see her again in this life,

173
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,650
but then we met once more
in Celestial Crane City.

174
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,530
That made me certain it was fate.

175
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,250
Tell me what I need to do next, Preceptor.

176
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,510
Sima Jiao, do you think
more Spirit Fires are always better?

177
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,470
Your body can barely withstand them.

178
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,750
Why merge with so many?

179
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,630
Even if two Spirit Fires
can greatly boost your cultivation,

180
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:42,320
your body weakens as your techniques advance.

181
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,440
Shut up.

182
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,160
You don't understand.

183
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,830
Slow-healing wounds
are the least of your worries.

184
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,470
If you suffer a grave injury again,

185
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,470
it could cost you your life.

186
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:56,770
Who in this world could possibly hurt me?

187
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,870
Stop trying to look tough, will you?

188
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,400
I'm warning you.

189
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,800
If you want to keep living peacefully,

190
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,750
sharing sweet days with the woman you love,

191
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,790
stop overusing your Spirit Fire techniques.

192
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:10,550
I don't want to perish with you.

193
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:14,420
Don't tell her about the two Spirit Fires.

194
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,050
Yan, someone is here for you.

195
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,180
He just won't give up.

196
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,840
I ran into him at the door
when I returned from the market.

197
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,510
He said he wanted to see you.

198
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,360
My name is Heng Lin. Greetings, Grandmistress.

199
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,680
Aren't you the one from the black market

200
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,160
who knew where Grain Rain Vale was?

201
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,440
What brings you here?

202
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,440
I heard you had come to Winter City,
so I came to seek you out.

203
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,470
Forgive my abrupt visit.
I am here to invite you to Grain Rain Vale.

204
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,070
I can't go now.

205
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,160
I haven't saved enough for the trip.

206
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,960
Yan, the secluded place you mentioned

207
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,270
was Grain Rain Vale?

208
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,360
Yes.

209
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,360
Earlier, I failed to recognize
your exalted identity.

210
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,600
I didn't know you were
the Lord of Mercy's cultivation partner,

211
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,750
so I asked for 2,000 demon stones as usual.

212
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,270
Your master, Dongyang Zhenren,
has also settled at Grain Rain Vale.

213
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,310
When he learned you were in the Demon Realm,

214
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,420
he sent me to invite you.

215
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,310
Dongyang Zhenren? He's my master?

216
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,700
That's right.

217
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,290
Greetings, Grandmaster.

218
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,550
How was my relationship with this Zhenren?

219
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:29,470
He bore you no ill will.

220
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,600
Grandmaster, Grandmistress,

221
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,990
if you come to Grain Rain Vale,

222
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:36,220
it will be our great honor.

223
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,790
We can go on vacation!

224
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,230
Wonderful.

225
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:43,250
And I get to bask in the Grandmistress's glory.

226
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,180
Of course, I will go with you.

227
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,890
 

228
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,030
Follow me.

229
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,360
Look at those people.

230
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,640
Elsewhere, everyone tries to appear glamorous,

231
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,440
but here, they simply enjoy themselves.

232
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,920
What a perfect place for seclusion.

233
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,200
Heng Lin, you're back.

234
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,230
And with so many guests.

235
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,200
I'm back.

236
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,790
They are our honored guests.

237
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,360
- Welcome...
- This way, everyone.

238
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,090
Come and play here.

239
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,040
- Look.
- Slow down.

240
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,270
I want to play, too.

241
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,160
The flowers here are beautiful.

242
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,470
- They are.
- Lin!

243
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,350
- You've grown so tall. What about you?
- Lin!

244
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:32,700
- You've grown, too. Let's go this way.
- Come!

245
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,720
- What did you bring us...
- Here, look.

246
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,750
- Lin?
- I brought you something tasty.

247
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,590
What is it?

248
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,120
- I want some.
- There's enough for everyone.

249
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,600
- Who wants some?
- I want some too!

250
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,200
Look at Feng Qi, fitting in so naturally.

251
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,700
See? He isn't intimidated
by your Grandmaster at all.

252
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:52,270
Ever since Feng Qi arrived at Grain Rain Vale,

253
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:55,120
he has been trying to impress Ting Yan.

254
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,360
Grandmaster, let's just get her out of here.

255
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,310
This is exactly the wrong time to leave.

256
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:04,120
Walking out now would only
look like conceding to Feng Qi.

257
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,770
You are clueless. Stop making bad suggestions.

258
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,050
Noisy.

259
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,810
- Here.
- Here. Let's play together.

260
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,990
- Delicious?
- Yes!

261
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,960
So yummy!

262
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,200
- Go on and eat.
- Slow down. There's plenty.

263
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,920
- Let me try yours.
- Here.

264
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,880
- Here you go.
- Here's some more.

265
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,550
- Don't drop it.
- Ting Yan?

266
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,050
You can have this one.

267
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,600
I want this one.

268
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,710
Take it slow.

269
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,460
It really is you.

270
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,940
You are my master, right?

271
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,960
Only 18 short years have passed,

272
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,200
and you have already forgotten me?

273
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,360
I am sorry. Something happened to me,

274
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,360
and I lost all my memories.

275
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,900
Junior Sister Liao,
have you forgotten me as well?

276
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,330
Come and help me.

277
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,180
Say something.

278
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,120
I was so moved
to see Ting Yan again after so long

279
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,310
that I failed to notice
you had arrived as well, Grandmaster.

280
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,980
Apologies for the late welcome.

281
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,840
My disciples and I got separated back then,

282
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,490
and I fled here with Chang Qing.

283
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,790
I never thought I would
live to see you again, Grandmaster.

284
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,070
Dongyang, what's going on?

285
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:19,070
Masters, I've brought the Lord of Mercy
and his cultivation partner.

286
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:22,750
Greetings, Lord of Mercy!

287
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,750
Who is the Lord of Mercy?

288
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,750
I don't know either.

289
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,750
Lord of Mercy, you have come such a long way.

290
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,840
Do you have important business here?
 

291
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,160
I am only accompanying Ting Yan on a vacation.

292
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,460
No need to be nervous. Please rise.

293
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,120
A vacation?

294
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,160
To fix the sleep schedule and unwind...

295
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,400
 To fix my sleep schedule and unwind. 

296
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,360
- In short...
 - In short, to take a vacation. 

297
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,770
A vacation.

298
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,270
What a fine word.

299
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,400
May I ask, Grandmaster,

300
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,050
how long you plan to stay in Grain Rain Vale?

301
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,310
It's up to her.

302
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:11,160
Everyone, please allow me
to lead you to rest for now.

303
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,160
Later, we will hold a banquet for you,
our honored guests.

304
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,030
But unlike the outside world,

305
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:19,360
we have only simple vegetables,
fruits, and livestock.

306
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,640
Please forgive us for the lack of delicacies.

307
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,030
Then why don't we have a barbecue together?

308
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,990
I have plenty of grills with me.

309
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,690
Everyone can just bring

310
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,400
whatever they've grown or raised.

311
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,250
In that case,
we will hold a barbecue gathering.

312
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,600
Grandmaster, what do you think?

313
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,470
As the Grandmistress wishes.

314
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:44,400
Then the masters and I
will go make preparations.

315
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,700
Yes.

316
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,380
That was a bit dramatic.

317
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,200
Enjoy yourself here.

318
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,140
I will return after giving some instructions.

319
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,940
All right... Come on. Let's go have fun.

320
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,420
Greetings, Grandmaster.

321
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:16,840
Grandmaster, is there anything else you need?

322
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,220
Are all those in charge
of Grain Rain Vale here?

323
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:22,620
Yes, they are all here.

324
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:29,250
You sent Heng Lin to bring Liao Ting Yan here.

325
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,790
What was your true purpose?

326
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:36,600
I heard that Ting Yan
had strayed into the Demon Realm,

327
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,640
so I invited her here to reunite.

328
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,600
We mean no harm.

329
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,530
It is true.

330
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:52,400
With your special identities,

331
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,440
it is indeed wise to be cautious.

332
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,160
For Grain Rain Vale to be graced

333
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,310
by the Grandmaster and Grandmistress

334
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,750
is our great honor.

335
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:05,010
Then please take good care of her.

336
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:09,770
We will do everything we can
to look after our honored guests.

337
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,140
This is like a paradise in the Demon Realm.

338
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:21,420
Do you like it here?

339
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,400
Very much.

340
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,310
There are no corpses on the road,

341
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:29,510
and no killing or looting.

342
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,710
People here live in peace.

343
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:35,440
Sunshine is everywhere,
and the air smells of flowers.

344
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,700
It's the perfect place for rest and living.

345
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:42,030
If you wish, both the Immortal Realm
and the Demon Realm

346
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:44,420
can become the paradise you want.

347
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,200
Stop feeding me empty promises.

348
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,070
I am content just to enjoy a vacation

349
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,010
here in Grain Rain Vale.

350
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:04,180
 My destiny is to live a carefree life,
eating, drinking, and enjoying myself. 

351
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,570
You are more and more like your old self.

352
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,920
What was I like?

353
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,960
Always talking nonsense,
unable to take much strain,

354
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,700
and fond of eating and sleeping.

355
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,770
It's all thanks to you.

356
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,270
What's this?

357
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,940
Open it.

358
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,840
More pills?

359
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,230
If I eat all these,

360
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:50,250
won't I be soaring to the highest realm?

361
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,680
You can't keep doing this,
or you'll run out of blood.

362
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,840
These are only for taste.

363
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,330
No blood needed.

364
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,990
Then what's the point of eating them?

365
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:08,070
You like their taste, don't you?

366
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,850
Just eat them as candy.

367
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,360
Eat some more.

368
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,570
If you finish, I'll have them make more.

369
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:42,960
Too much candy turns bitter.

370
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,290
Taking it slow makes it taste better.

371
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:17,200
What are you doing? You need to cut that up.

372
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,230
It looks nicer this way.

373
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:22,070
Feng Qi, get some more of this.

374
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,120
I like it.

375
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,380
All right.

376
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,920
- Quick, come here.
- Is this done yet?

377
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,310
- Yes. Put it down here.
- Hurry.

378
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,220
Get two skewers fresh off the grill.

379
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,680
Here, My Lord.

380
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,950
It smells so good.

381
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,510
Lamb skewers.

382
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:39,250
These are lamb skewers, fat and lean together.

383
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,490
Silly.

384
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,700
You eat them like this.

385
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:00,550
Senior Sister, whose Qingling melons
do you think are better, his or mine?

386
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,160
They are both good.

387
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,960
We were just arguing over whose melon deserves

388
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,310
to be called the true Qingling melon.

389
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,120
Please judge for us.

390
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,850
Please taste them.

391
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,440
Yours is sweet, and yours is crisp.

392
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,710
I say call this Sweet Qingling Melon

393
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:27,570
and this Crisp Qingling Melon.

394
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,440
Thank you. Please enjoy!

395
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,980
Thank you, Senior Sister.

396
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,510
Junior Sister Liao, and sir,

397
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,640
please try the beef
of the celestial ox I raised.

398
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,680
My junior sister
carefully marinated and grilled it.

399
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,680
Paired with our vale's wine,
the taste is excellent.

400
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,960
He rarely slaughters his treasured oxen.

401
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,270
Even we hardly ever get to eat this.

402
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:55,550
Go on. Try these.

403
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,400
You don't want to? Then have a drink!

404
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,050
- Here.
- Don't be rude!

405
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,680
You two have never left the vale,

406
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,070
so you don't know who this great man is.

407
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,900
Mind your manners.

408
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,230
It's all right.

409
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:13,230
The truth is, he never eats this sort of thing,

410
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:15,600
so I am eating all of these.

411
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,980
If he won't drink, I'll drink with you.

412
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,360
To celebrate Ting Yan's reunion
with her master,

413
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,470
I will drink a cup as well.

414
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:36,270
How nice. I wish
I had a cultivation partner, too.

415
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:38,810
- Senior Sister, is it hard to find one?
- Here's to you, Grandmaster.

416
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,440
Not too hard, I suppose.

417
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,050
Don't ask what you shouldn't.

418
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,960
Senior Sister, how did you and your partner

419
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,360
find each other?

420
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,470
Don't you still have work to finish?

421
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,600
- Go.
- Come on.

422
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,950
- Go.
- Let's go.

423
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,600
What are you laughing at?

424
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,750
They all seem so scared of you.

425
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:11,030
Anyone who knows my name fears me.

426
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,810
I don't fear you.

427
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,120
You don't?

428
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,770
I'm terrified.

429
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:33,740
Grandmaster, Ting Yan, try this braised duck.

430
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,885
The Demon Realm is not like the Immortal Realm.

431
00:30:37,885 --> 00:30:42,920
With spirit veins scarce, we had to
work very hard to raise these Lvhua ducks.

432
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,600
They are tender and delicious, though.

433
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,090
Let me try.

434
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,470
Delicate texture, juicy, and so tasty I feel...

435
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:54,530
Like your tongue might melt away.

436
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:57,770
How did you know I was about to say that?

437
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,400
This duck really is delicious.

438
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,710
And it seems nourishing.

439
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:11,330
I feel so energized right now.

440
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,710
Junior Sister, Master, come and try this!

441
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,090
Let's go.

442
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,570
Coming!

443
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:39,290
Thank you.

444
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,510
Grandmaster, are you all right?

445
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:47,270
I'm fine.

446
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:50,270
If this goes on, Ting Yan will find out.

447
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,900
Quiet.

448
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:10,220
 Spirit Fire, coveted by all, 

449
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,140
 is nothing good at all. 

450
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:55,160
I'm telling you,

451
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,360
it's all thanks to our sect's protection

452
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,360
that we get to live such a carefree life.

453
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,360
Don't you think?

454
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,660
Yes.

455
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,620
Ting Yan.

456
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:11,290
Did you enjoy yourself here
at Grain Rain Vale today?

457
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,570
I haven't felt so relaxed in a long time.

458
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,920
Though Grain Rain Vale lies in the Demon Realm,

459
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,470
it has nothing in common with it.

460
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:23,940
When I first arrived,
I, too, found it unbelievable.

461
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:25,840
If I could always live

462
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,200
in such a peaceful and pleasant place,

463
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,620
that'd be nice.

464
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:35,330
Yan.

465
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,050
If you like it here,

466
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:42,420
we can stay here together.

467
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:47,290
What, are you done
looking for the one you love?

468
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,400
I have never stopped searching for her.

469
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,850
And soon...

470
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,330
I will find her.

471
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,440
Congratulations.

472
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,230
If you can find her,

473
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:09,470
bringing her here to live

474
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:11,810
would be a fine choice.

475
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,580
You will understand soon enough.

476
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,500
Master.

477
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,620
I feel a little drunk.

478
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:28,890
Then go back and rest.

479
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,470
I've eaten my fill as well.

480
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,280
- I will head back soon.
- All right.

481
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,580
Be careful.

482
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,810
Cheer up.

483
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:04,890
I think Yan and the Grandmaster
are a perfect match.

484
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:12,630
Besides, Yan has obviously
developed feelings for him.

485
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,740
Don't tell me you can't see it.

486
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,590
Feng Qi, if you ask me,

487
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:21,800
you should just stay her friend.

488
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,070
Really.

489
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:25,020
It's still too early

490
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,180
to say who wins and who loses.

491
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,220
Fool. Truly a fool.

492
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,810
Hong Luo.

493
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,150
Look over there.

494
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:45,720
The moon is beautiful tonight.

495
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:49,500
Would you take a walk with me?

496
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,850
Everyone has their own troubles.

497
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,700
So, that's a yes?

498
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:04,470
Has my tolerance gotten worse?

499
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:07,500
How am I this drunk from just half a jug?

500
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:12,740
Yan, are you all right?

501
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,070
I'm fine.

502
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:20,630
I must have drunk too much.
I feel a little dizzy, and even strangely cold.

503
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:26,030
Yan, does this place feel familiar to you?

504
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:28,590
Grain Rain Vale?

505
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:31,240
It does seem familiar.

506
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:36,540
Could it be you really
came here before but forgot?

507
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:39,880
If you don't remember, I can help you.

508
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:44,110
Sorry, Feng Qi.
I think I'm too drunk to think straight.

509
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:46,400
Let's talk tomorrow.

510
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,360
I'll walk you back.

511
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:52,220
No need. I'll walk around to sober up.

512
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:23,290
Did you have fun?

513
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,930
I did.

514
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:30,110
 ♫ Prism of three lifetimes ♫ 

515
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:35,220
The vegetables they grew
and the meat they grilled were all delicious.

516
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:39,020
Your hand is so warm.

517
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,500
Are you drunk?

518
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:46,540
No, I didn't drink much.

519
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:54,180
 ♫ No fate's tangle, no parting swans ♫ 

520
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,980
 ♫ Memories fade ♫ 

521
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:59,380
 ♫ We wander the mortal world in search ♫ 

522
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:03,500
 ♫ Yet forget the reason why ♫ 

523
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,980
 ♫ Cycle back to raging flames ♫ 

524
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:10,580
 ♫ Even if my very soul were to vanish ♫ 

525
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:15,470
 ♫ Be it destiny or doom,
I light up the endless night ♫ 

526
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:18,770
Why do you always smile
after looking at me for a while?

527
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,850
In the past, were you like this too?

528
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,240
Did I smile?

529
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,220
You did.

530
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:31,780
 ♫ Mad love blooms a lotus in the heart ♫ 

531
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,660
Then I suppose I did.

532
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,020
And you're the same.

533
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,580
Many of your habits seem to have changed,

534
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:53,180
but I still feel...

535
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,850
that you...

536
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,780
are the same person as before.

537
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:04,880
 ♫ Snow not gone, flame not out ♫ 

538
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,100
I thought these 18 years in the Demon Realm

539
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:13,220
had changed me completely.

540
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:17,940
As long as your soul isn't gone...

541
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:22,400
 ♫ Thousands of stars in your eyes ♫ 

542
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,810
No.

543
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:26,740
Even if your soul were reborn,

544
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,450
I'm confident I would still recognize you.

545
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,850
If you can always be this confident,

546
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,960
then I, too, have faith.

547
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,540
I could recognize you at first sight.

548
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:46,660
 ♫ Even if my very soul were to vanish ♫ 

549
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:50,500
 ♫ Be it destiny or doom,
I light up the endless night ♫ 

550
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,620
 ♫ To chase the darkness away from your dreams ♫ 

551
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:56,860
 ♫ Even if heaven and earth turned to ash ♫ 

552
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:00,780
 ♫ I would never regret the day I met you ♫ 

553
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:07,900
 ♫ Mad love blooms a lotus in the heart ♫ 

554
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:17,660
 ♫ Mad love blooms a lotus in the heart ♫ 

555
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,720
 ♫ Autumn winds sigh ♫ 

556
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,760
 ♫ Moon and stars dapple the sky ♫ 

557
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,680
 ♫ Brushing the loneliness of bygone days ♫ 

558
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,640
 ♫ Candlelight flickers low ♫ 

559
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,880
 ♫ Shadows sway ♫ 

560
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,640
 ♫ Shimmering in the night ♫ 

561
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,720
 ♫ With a brush I draw ♫ 

562
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,680
 ♫ The color of light ♫ 

563
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,680
 ♫ To warm your frozen soul ♫ 

564
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,680
 ♫ Memories anchor here ♫ 

565
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,760
 ♫ Longing is engraved ♫ 

566
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,080
 ♫ Yet cannot be touched ♫ 

567
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,440
 ♫ Following ♫ 

568
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,840
 ♫ The veins of gravel ♫ 

569
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:39,720
 ♫ I turn into spirit fire ♫ 

570
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,600
 ♫ Burning away ♫ 

571
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:47,680
 ♫ All these karmic ties ♫ 

572
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,880
 ♫ To save you ♫ 

573
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,920
 ♫ To save me ♫ 

574
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,800
 ♫ To cross over all suffering,
I'll break through ♫ 

575
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,880
 ♫ The laws of heaven ♫ 

576
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,840
 ♫ The vortex of reincarnation ♫ 

577
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:03,760
 ♫ What of life and death? ♫ 

578
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,640
 ♫ To save you ♫ 

579
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,680

581
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,680
 ♫ Right and wrong ♫ 

582
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,760
 ♫ Rumors and tales ♫ 

583
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,360
