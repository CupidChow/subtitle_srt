OST credit

3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,540
 ♫ Heavens strike with thunderous wrath ♫ 

4
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,420
 ♫ Mountains and rivers shatter before my eyes ♫ 

5
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,680
 ♫ Endless splendor
cultivated through lifetimes ♫ 

6
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,320
 ♫ Turns to dust between my fingers
in an instant ♫ 

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,220
 ♫ When the line
between good and evil is clear ♫ 

8
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,240
 ♫ Countless souls drift
into the boundless wilds ♫ 

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,500
 ♫ Carrying the spirit fire forward ♫ 

10
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,580
 ♫ I defy fate ♫ 

11
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,860
 ♫ Just to remain by your side ♫ 

12
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,900
 ♫ Falling into love's abyss ♫ 

13
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,660
 ♫ Like heavy rain pouring down ♫ 

14
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:08,460
 ♫ Drunk on romance ♫ 

15
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,260
 ♫ In a blink, love and hate
vanish into illusion ♫ 

16
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:16,300
 ♫ Falling into endless love ♫ 

17
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,420
 ♫ Stirring waves upending a lifetime ♫ 

18
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,700
 ♫ Even if this life leads to ruin ♫ 

19
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,980
 ♫ I still choose to be entangled with you ♫ 

20
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,225
 ♫ Through all lifetimes ♫ 

21
00:01:30,225 --> 00:01:36,540
 

22
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,503
 

23
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,000
Pull yourself together.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,980
Your father has told us about Baifeng Mountain.

25
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,800
My Grand...

26
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,240
My young master is very powerful.

27
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,160
You can count on him
to take care of things there

28
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,960
and ensure your safety.

29
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,450
We've already paved the way for you.

30
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,000
From now on, you can live however you want.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,190
How can I possibly live a carefree life

32
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,210
after going through something like this?

33
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,580
The Fengshan bloodline

34
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:13,470
will one day drag me back into tragedy.

35
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,320
He's right.

36
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,890
Grandmaster, why don't you
go check on Ms. Qing Er?

37
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,970
Please.

38
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:46,270
After all, you still haven't met your daughter.

39
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,540
You were the one who named her Yue Qing.

40
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,060
Don't you want to see her?

41
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,600
Yue Qing?

42
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,480
My child?

43
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,550
Zhou Yue Qing.

44
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,160
You gave her that name yourself.

45
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,540
Come with me. Meet her.

46
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,110
Thank you so much back there.

47
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,290
I will never forget this kindness.

48
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,770
I didn't do it for you.

49
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,420
I know.

50
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,820
To you, it may have been nothing.

51
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:35,040
But to me, it's a blessing for a lifetime.

52
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,270
What about Master Yan?

53
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,430
I'll take care of it.

54
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,340
Much obliged.

55
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,720
Even though I can't shake off
this settling feeling,

56
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,440
this is also the most at peace
I've felt in years.

57
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,810
Peace...

58
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,970
It feels like only recently

59
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,330
I've learned what peace means.

60
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,270
Congratulations.

61
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,370
The groom has arrived.

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,560
Huan!

63
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,680
Huan!

64
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,370
Ms. Qing Er...

65
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:31,420
Look, with the help of this young lady and this gentleman

66
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,910
I found us a home.

67
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,080
Do you like it, Huan?

68
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,890
Ms. Qing Er, why waste your time
on someone worthless like me?

69
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,740
Huan.

70
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,660
Don't you want to hold our daughter?

71
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,140
Here.

72
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,200
Why are you crying?

73
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,790
This is so touching.

74
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,110
It feels rude not to cry.

75
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:35,800
Knowing that I helped make this happen makes me feel pretty amazing.

76
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,030
Huan, sit.

77
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:50,660
Huan, the kind lady prepared everything for us.

78
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,670
She helped us reunite with each other.

79
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,590
Put her to sleep.

80
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,470
I'll go prepare some food and wine.

81
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:02,350
Tonight, we should celebrate.

82
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,080
Ms. Qing Er.

83
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,190
The way you are now is different from when I first met you
at the pleasure house.

84
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,560
Back then, your smile could topple a city,

85
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,730
your hands never did chores.

86
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,730
But now you're content with a quiet home,

87
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:18,050
and willing to cook and care for me.

88
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,660
Huan. Don't make fun of me.

89
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:26,130
As long as I have you and Yue with me, I'll be content anywhere.

90
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,320
Yue.

91
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,080
It's the first time we've met.

92
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,880
I want to keep you in my arms forever.

93
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:58,970
So, this is the wondrous bond
of blood and kinship.

94
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,790
Such a tiny being

95
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,620
has given me so much courage.

96
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,270
 I don't want to go back there. 

97
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,000
 It's terrifying. 

98
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,350
 It's disgusting. 

99
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,680
 I am but a lifeless man. 

100
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,550
 I am nothing but a walking corpse. 

101
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,450
Yue. The two of us...

102
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,030
We need to find a place no one can ever reach.

103
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,880
Only then can we live
a peaceful and happy life.

104
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,460
And we won't drag your mother down with us.

105
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,180
Will you come with me?

106
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,350
The Yan family's ill fate

107
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,390
should end with our generation.

108
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:09,730
Mr. Yan and Ms. Qing Er
finally got their happy ending.

109
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:12,640
You could say we've done a good deed.

110
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,330
Let's take it as building up our own blessings.

111
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,080
Do you really think

112
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,000
this peace will last?

113
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,210
Of course it will last.

114
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:33,870
Grandmaster, a person's fate
is in their own hands.

115
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:37,280
As long as we want to change,

116
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,720
we can alter our own destiny.

117
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,220
Do you know what destiny is?

118
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,180
Of course I do.

119
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:52,490
My destiny is to live a carefee life,

120
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,680
eating, drinking, and having fun.

121
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,410
Yue! Huan!

122
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:01,920
Huan!

123
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,990
- Not another step!
- Huan!

124
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,990
Huan!

125
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,510
Not another step!

126
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,470
- Huan!
- Stay away!

127
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,470
Yes, but calm down!

128
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,800
Stay away!

129
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,680
Huan! Huan, don't do it!

130
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,870
- Ms. Qing Er, don't go!
- Huan!

131
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,750
- Huan!
- Put Yue down now!

132
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,160
Ms. Qing Er...

133
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,630
A quick release is better than suffering.

134
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,410
No. Please, no!

135
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:27,410
You have no idea what life Yue would be forced to endure.

136
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:28,820
- Huan, stop!
- Don't do this!

137
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,650
Huan, don't! Please!

138
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,110
- Ms. Qing Er!
- No!

139
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,590
Calm down!

140
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,960
Ms. Qing Er...

141
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,280
 Would you rather live in shame 

142
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,950
 than die with your head held high? 

143
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,350
Huan! Don't you dare touch my Yue!

144
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,440
Please, help us!

145
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,710
Save him!

146
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,160
- Please!
- Grandmaster!

147
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,040
 I can't let him go on like this. 

148
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,680
 Better to end it now, 

149
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,660
 and stop the Fengshan curse once and for all. 

150
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,110
Give her back to me!

151
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,160
- Huan!
- Grandmaster, can't you save him?

152
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,200
You have the power.

153
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,440
- You can save Mr. Yan and Yue! 
 - Huan, please, calm down!

154
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,750
Grandmaster!

155
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,700
No one can save him.

156
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:07,920
Sir...

157
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,560
This is his fate.

158
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,080
- No!
- But what about the child?

159
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,080
She's alive, she's her own person!

160
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,710
She deserves her own future.

161
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,560
She should be free to choose.

162
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,830
Grandmaster, your mother didn't do it.

163
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,320
Yan Huan, and neither can you!

164
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,860
No!

165
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:31,740
You are right.

166
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,840
- Give my daughter back!
- Yan Huan!

167
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,230
Give her back!

168
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,870
Yue...

169
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,110
My precious girl.

170
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,140
I can't let you endure the same suffering.

171
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,690
I can't watch you die so young.

172
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,990
- Yan Huan!
- No!

173
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,490
No! Huan!

174
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,810
Huan, I beg you!

175
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:02,220
- Yan Huan!
- Please, Huan, don't!

176
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,010
Huan!

177
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,700
Huan, please don't do this!

178
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,160
I beg you, stop!

179
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,680
Huan!

180
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,110
Yue!

181
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,490
He destroyed the flame-shaped birthmark.

182
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:24,580
But how can the blood of Fengshan be erased?

183
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:28,930
♫ ♫

184
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,700
At last...

185
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:35,370
At last, it's over.

186
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:40,320
At last, I can turn to ashes.

187
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,600
 ♫ Watching the world change ♫ 

188
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,370
Huan...

189
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:20,160
 Ever since I opened my Soul Manor, 

190
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,720
 I've begun to feel that everything here is tied to me. 

191
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,780
 The fates of those around me pull at my heart. 

192
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,590
 Today, the tragedy of Zhou Qing Er and Yan Huan 

193
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:37,070
 has actually left me deeply shaken. 

194
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:41,160
 Yan Huan only lived for a little over 20 years, 

195
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:47,310
 yet Grandmaster has endured for centuries under the same fate. 

196
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,490
 For Yan Huan, death was release. 

197
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,390
 But for Grandmaster? 

198
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,820
 He must suffer even more than Yan Huan did. 

199
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,800
 And yet... 

200
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,240
 What could I possibly say to him? 

201
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,440
 Kill him! 

202
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,230
 Kill him! 

203
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,580
 Kill him! 

204
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,440
 Only then will your wretched fate end. 

205
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,940
 No! 

206
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,430
 No! 

207
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,020
 His life belongs to Gengchen Celestial Palace. 

208
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,590
 Hand him over! Now! 

209
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,750
 Quickly! They're coming! 

210
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,920
 Hurry! 

211
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,160
 No! 

212
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,580
 Jiao! 

213
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,940
 Jiao! 

214
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,260
 Mother... 

215
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,610
Sima Jiao!

216
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,820
Grandmaster, I tied this bow just for you.

217
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,920
Isn't it cute?

218
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,440
- Grandmaster...
- I know what you want to say.

219
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,110
But I must say it.

220
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,370
You are not Yan Huan.

221
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,370
You are yourself.

222
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,320
We have different paths, but the same end.

223
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,960
Grandmaster.

224
00:16:01,773 --> 00:16:04,390
 

225
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,110
Normally, when I wake up,

226
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,350
Sima Jiao opens his eyes, too.

227
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,800
Why is there no movement this time?

228
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,960
Did he pass out?

229
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,100
Thank goodness, you're all right.

230
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,320
I was so worried.

231
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,010
 Kill him! 

232
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,280
 Kill him! 

233
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,680
 Only then will your wretched fate end. 

234
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,040
 Jiao! 

235
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,550
 Jiao! 

236
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,080
 Mother... 

237
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,600
Grandmaster, what's wrong?

238
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,440
I had a dream.

239
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,180
Grandmaster, you not only slept,
you even dreamed?

240
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,550
What did you dream of?

241
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,800
I dreamed of that woman.

242
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:32,740
 Others see me with nothing but fear, disgust, or flattery. 

243
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:36,630
 But she treated me like the flowers and trees by the roadside. 

244
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,790
 Boss. 

245
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:41,880
 Don't waste such a handsome face
by acting so cold. 

246
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,680
 What kind of Grandmaster are you? 

247
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,950
 You're acting like a schoolkid. 

248
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,080
 Such light, fleeting feelings 

249
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,100
 always brought me peace. 

250
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,030
 So, weak as she was, 

251
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:59,660
 and yet she could always
take such good care of herself. 

252
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,440
Master.

253
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,670
The one who will take us
to Baifeng Mountain has arrived.

254
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,110
Take this.

255
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,780
Why can't I come along?

256
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,470
You stay here.

257
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,190
Let's go.

258
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,290
Greetings, emissary.

259
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,360
Same rules.

260
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,750
If the bloodline power is pure,

261
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,680
we will grant you generous rewards.

262
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,840
If the bloodline power is lacking,

263
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,610
then take the child back with you.

264
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:37,030
Yes, yes. I know the rules.

265
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,360
Son, hurry.

266
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,550
Test the child's blood.

267
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,970
Quickly.

268
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,900
Yue.

269
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,490
Thank you.

270
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,410
You used to come alone.

271
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,600
Why is there another with you now?

272
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,750
This is my son.

273
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,780
One day, he'll inherit my family's estate.

274
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:29,420
So, sooner or later,
he must see it for himself.

275
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,732
 

276
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,640
Master, who exactly are you?

277
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,160
We've done all this only to survive.

278
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,190
Please don't blame us.

279
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,240
We wait here.

280
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,630
You know the rules.

281
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,040
You must not wander about here.

282
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,870
This is the place?

283
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,230
Insolence! You insulted the sacred mountain!

284
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,310
Sacred?

285
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,270
You actually call this place "sacred"?

286
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,750
What, does the Yan family intend to rebel?

287
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,790
Son, don't be rude.

288
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,990
The Yan family has hundreds of lives at stake.

289
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,540
We can't afford such insolence.

290
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,720
Enough. Don't waste time here.

291
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,190
You, take her inside.

292
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,030
It's not your place to give orders here.

293
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:04,180
You must be tired of living, aren't you?

294
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,520
Take me inside.

295
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,190
There is a barrier here
set against the Sima clan.

296
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:23,280
Shi Qian Lv's defensive skills
are indeed impressive.

297
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:45,910
You're from the Fengshan clan.

298
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,250
Please, kill us.

299
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:59,510
They have been forcing us
to reproduce even faster.

300
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,120
They are close to success.

301
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,360
Just a bit more.

302
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,490
Careful!

303
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,100
It's coming out!

304
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:13,200
I beg you, kill us.

305
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,600
How could I kill my own people?

306
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,710
We're already as good as dead.

307
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:21,440
Let our suffering end by your hand.

308
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,220
It's better than being drained dry
and eaten by them.

309
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:32,130
Please, I beg you! End our suffering!

310
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:34,180
I beg you!

311
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,870
Come, be careful.

312
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,600
I beg you.

313
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,200
I don't wish for the child to live and suffer.

314
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,270
I do not want them to take the child away.

315
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:01,070
How can you be so heartless?

316
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,310
Do you want this child to grow up

317
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:07,660
and be kept like livestock, just like us?

318
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,440
I will take the child away.

319
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,490
Give up this idea.

320
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,070
We've lived a cruel life.

321
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:18,400
I do not want to live those days
for even one more day.

322
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,750
I do not want my child to live in such a hell.

323
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:28,710
 I do not want him to have such a life. 

324
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:31,660
 It's no different from a caged bird. 

325
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,160
Go quickly.

326
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,660
Hurry up!

327
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,620
Hurry.

328
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,360
Go.

329
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,160
Quickly.

330
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,800
Stay close.

331
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:02,420
Sir, take my blood. Porridge.

332
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,400
Sir.

333
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,840
Give blood.

334
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,460
Porridge.

335
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,440
 Grandmaster, endure it. 

336
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,960
 You'll feel better with the blood out. 

337
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,140
I want porridge.

338
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,660
Porridge.

339
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,210
Take my blood.

340
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,820
Who turned you into this?

341
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:38,310
He said if there is blood, then I get porridge.

342
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,770
Porridge.

343
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,250
Take my blood.

344
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,790
- Take my blood.
- Where is he?

345
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,550
I want porridge.

346
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,770
Tell me where the man is.

347
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,680
How many more of the Fengshan clan are here?

348
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,790
I do not know either.

349
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,840
Every child with a flame-shaped birthmark

350
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,110
is sent to Baifeng Mountain.

351
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,960
- Go.
- Come on.

352
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,080
We can leave now!

353
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:49,470
You dare stand in my way?

354
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,880
We have an array against the Sima clan.

355
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,340
He will not gain any advantage.

356
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,750
Do you think you can save anyone?

357
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,440
All of their bodies
are bound with restrictions.

358
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,820
Once this barrier is broken, they will all die.

359
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,270
Stay here!

360
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:19,200
Come back!

361
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,510
Stop!

362
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,960
If you leave here, you will die!

363
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,230
That is still better than being livestock,

364
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:27,620
caged and eaten, never seeing daylight again!

365
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,560
Come back!

366
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:42,030
Father, Sima Jiao has broken
into Baifeng Mountain.

367
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,880
He may destroy our operation.

368
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,310
Quickly, go tell the palace heads.

369
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:50,680
Say that Chiyan City has sent a plea for help.

370
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,600
Sima Jiao has gone mad.

371
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,270
He's burning down Baifeng Mountain
and seeks to slaughter Chiyan City.

372
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,730
Yes.

373
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,360
Zhen Xu, set fire in Chiyan City.

374
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,510
Make the flames spread as much as possible.

375
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:17,340
Say it was done by Sima Jiao.

376
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,350
Sima Jiao.

377
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,620
You asked for it.

378
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,470
Greetings, Sect Master.

379
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,920
Now the Shi family and the palaces

380
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,270
seem intent on capturing Sima Jiao.

381
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:47,390
Perhaps we can use their hands
to take his life.

382
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,020
Has the news about Baifeng Mountain reached the Eight Palaces?

383
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,160
Sect Master, Master Yuan is ill
and cannot come.

384
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,310
Madam Ye is missing.

385
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,310
The other palace heads are ready.

386
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,840
Ru Ling.

387
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:08,640
Shi Qian Lv is gathering
the palace heads and elders.

388
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,200
They must have found traces of the Grandmaster.

389
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,160
Ru Ling, watch them closely.

390
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,530
I will report to the Grandmaster.

391
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:23,230
Nian Jiu, forgive me.

392
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:26,150
I can't let you inform Sima Jiao.

393
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,420
Very well, let us depart.

394
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,010
 The palaces and the Shi family will join forces against Sima Jiao. 

395
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:39,790
 This may be the best chance
for me and my people to return to the Demon Realm. 

396
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:42,062
 

397
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,070
What are you looking at, you filthy brat?

398
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,200
Annoying kid.

399
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,920
Fire! Run!

400
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,530
What fire! What's happening?

401
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:01,390
What's going on?

402
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,390
Run!

403
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,550
Is the Grandmaster in trouble?

404
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:58,100
No, I must go find him!

405
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,940
My child!

406
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:14,690
My child!

407
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:17,720
The glory and wealth of the Yan family!

408
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:31,350
A sea of purgatory flames...

409
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,630
Master Yan!

410
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:49,520
I must find Sima Jiao.

411
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,280
 As long as I exist, 

412
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,300
 the fate of the Sima bloodline
can't be changed. 

413
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,280
 If one day the Fengshan Spirit Fire
no longer exists in this world, 

414
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:10,550
 then perhaps the Sima clan
may finally be freed. 

415
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,360
May you be born

416
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:37,270
into a good family in the next life.

417
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,960
Grandmaster!

418
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:52,590
How did you end up like this?

419
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,990
I am dying.

420
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:58,470
Now is not the time to joke.

421
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,490
Since the day I was born,

422
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:03,800
many have wanted to kill me.

423
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:07,210
They wanted my life.

424
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,690
But I wouldn't give it to them.

425
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,410
Whoever wants my life...

426
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,990
will lose theirs.

427
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,740
But...

428
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,110
Grandmaster...

429
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:30,680
If you want my life now,

430
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,580
I can give it to you.

431
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,550
Do you want it?

432
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,800
I don't!

433
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,910
But that is your mission.

434
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,970
I know you don't really want to kill me.

435
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:46,240
But if I die at your hands,
it will benefit you.

436
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,870
Stop pretending, will you?

437
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:52,210
You will not die here.

438
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,240
You truly don't want my life?

439
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,160
I don't.

440
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:01,960
 ♫ To save you, to save me ♫ 

441
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:05,800
 ♫ To cross over all suffering,
I'll break through ♫ 

442
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,920
Then you'll die with me.

443
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,070
I'll live with you.

444
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,190
Get up.

445
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,360

00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,820
Get up.

449
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,970
Only by destroying this place

450
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,130
can we keep the Fengshan bloodline

451
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:40,300
from ever being used again.

452
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,540
When I die,

453
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,820
this fire will burn my body away.

454
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,360
No.

455
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,470
I won't leave them a scrap of flesh.

456
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,630
No.

457
00:38:55,630 --> 00:39:00,620
Then the Fengshan line will be utterly wiped out.

458
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,760
Once this Spirit Fire goes out,

459
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,810
the lifeline of Gengchen Celestial Palace

460
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,320
will be severed.

461
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:12,780
Quit talking nonsense.

462
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,590
Get up.

463
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:17,460

They're not the Sima clan.

481
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,570
The clan perished in the fire long ago.

482
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:42,740
They must share the Fengshan bloodline.

we capture him.

Remember this.

486
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,960

511
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,940
 ♫ The vortex of reincarnation ♫ 

512
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:41,040
 ♫ What of life and death? ♫

 ♫ I'll face promises ♫ 

530
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,000
 ♫ Like a moth to a flame ♫ 

531
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:41,320
 ♫ And use my body to shine on even more. ♫
