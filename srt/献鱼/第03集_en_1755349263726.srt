Episode 16

5
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You... you... you're wet!

6
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You're still alive!

7
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Sister, I mean...

8
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You're not dead?

9
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Of course I'm not dead!

10
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I didn't mean to offend you.

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You just gave me a lesson.

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I will obey your instruction.

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I will be careful in the future.

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
How is your master today?

15
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
He...

16
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
No.

17
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
How can you say that?

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Master, everything is fine.

19
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's your honor to serve him.

20
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Do it yourself.

21
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It seems that he was trying to scare me.

22
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So why is he not like a master at all?

23
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Like a schoolboy.

24
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Maybe he's not a smart master.

25
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
He's not a weak master who can kill himself for a small thing.

26
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
He can help me relieve the pain of the fire.

27
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
If he really doesn't have any feelings for me,

28
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
he can be a good chess piece.

29
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Go and remove the barrier outside the tower.

30
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Use the Demon Citadel as a bait.

31
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Open the door.

32
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The mouse will follow the gap and come in.

33
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I don't need to work to get a card.

34
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I feel so comfortable.

35
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
There's no water.

36
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The disciples seem to be fond of the masters.

37
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
They can enter and exit the tower freely.

38
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yes.

39
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I wonder what's special about him.

40
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Could it be that he can only get close to the masters with low cultivation?

41
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Who knows?

42
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Why are you still not sleeping?

43
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm not sleeping.

44
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm not sleeping.

45
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm not sleeping.

46
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm not sleeping.

47
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Why are you still alive?

48
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm ashamed.

49
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm a low-key person.

50
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I haven't been in danger.

51
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You escaped from the palace once.

52
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You're lucky.

53
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You'd better not think about the masters.

54
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Otherwise, you'll die sooner or later.

55
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What?

56
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You're afraid that he'll take a step ahead of you to get the master's favor, right?

57
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
He's a low-level spiritual root that doesn't know where it comes from.

58
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
He deserves it.

59
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So what if he's low-level?

60
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Is he born with good cultivation?

61
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Is he born with a high level of talent?

62
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Of course.

63
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Why, Ye Ruo Ling?

64
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You're born with low-level cultivation.

65
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So you're close to him?

66
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I advise you to find another companion.

67
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
His identity is lower than your low-level spiritual root.

68
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
This colleague.

69
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
This teacher.

70
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You think I'm a useless person.

71
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
How did you get a life attack?

72
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You're so powerful that you bully people who are weaker than you.

73
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Is it too much?

74
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You're talking nonsense.

75
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I don't understand.

76
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
They insulted you so much before.

77
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You didn't even fight back.

78
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
How can you help me today?

79
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
They don't like me as a backward person.

80
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I can understand.

81
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
They can't use the topic to make a fuss.

82
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's too much to talk about men's background.

83
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Although I can't understand what you're talking about.

84
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But I can hear that you look down on me.

85
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You're so beautiful and capable.

86
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I appreciate you.

87
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
My thanks gift.

88
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's sweet. Try it.

89
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Thank you.

90
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I really like it here more and more.

91
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I don't need to work and work.

92
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I met a good colleague.

93
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Although I also meet the crazy people who like to fight in the workplace.

94
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
As long as I don't interfere, I can get a big ending.

95
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
What card?

96
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
What are these?

97
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I don't understand.

98
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Just take it as the way we talk alone.

99
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
How about this?

100
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You really have nothing to ask for?

101
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I don't have any curiosity or curiosity.

102
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I just want to be comfortable.

103
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Just live.

104
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I have to wake up naturally every day.

105
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Eat and sleep.

106
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Really?

107
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Those immortals should practice their own life.

108
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The heart is happy and the body is happy.

109
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
In fact, everyone has a dirty desire.

110
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And you are different.

111
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Although you are bullied.

112
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
But you can still find your freedom and return to your original heart.

113
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I think there must be no second disciple in this mountain.

114
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Can live as thoroughly as you.

115
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Are you talking about me?

116
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Learned.

117
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The meaning of speaking.

118
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But aren't you also a person from the Immortal's Mansion?

119
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Why do you say that you are not like them?

120
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
All the way.

121
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Just a man.

122
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Just a man.

123
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
We are sisters from now on.

124
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
OK.

125
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I can come in without knocking on the door this time.

126
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I have to climb again.

127
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Can I not climb?

128
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Follow me if you don't want to die.

129
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I am so tired.

130
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I don't have insurance and I don't pay the salary.

131
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's darker than my home.

132
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I am so tired.

133
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I don't have insurance and I don't pay the salary.

134
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's darker than my home.

135
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
As far as I know,

136
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
this must be very precious.

137
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Boss,

138
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
did you hear the child crying?

139
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You come here every day

140
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
and give this to this person.

141
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
He saw it

142
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
and cried.

143
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
He cried.

144
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
He cried.

145
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
He cried.

146
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
He cried.

147
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
When he looked at it,

148
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I was annoyed

149
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
and wanted to kill him.

150
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Are you serious?

151
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
This flower is lit with fire.

152
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Will it be extinguished?

153
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
If it can be extinguished,

154
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
it is a great achievement.

155
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Follow me.

156
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I thought I wouldn't have to work overtime

157
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
when I came to the Immortal World.

158
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I didn't expect it to be

159
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
even scarier than the real world.

160
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
If we don't work overtime,

161
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
we will lose our jobs.

162
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
If we don't work overtime in the Three Holy Mountains,

163
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
we will lose our lives.

164
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
What have I done?

165
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
What have I done?

166
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I don't know.

167
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I don't know.

168
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I don't know.

169
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What a devil.

170
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
When can I get rid of

171
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
this devil?

172
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
What are you thinking?

173
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Boss,

174
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm thinking that you can go to do something else.

175
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I won't be lazy.

176
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You always say boss.

177
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
What is boss?

178
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Boss is the person

179
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
who I keep working for and he keeps giving me rewards.

180
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
What is the difference between a boss and a horse?

181
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You have a good point.

182
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
We have similar opinions.

183
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Why don't you use magic to do things?

184
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You don't have high cultivation

185
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
so you are not good at training.

186
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And there are also

187
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
the main skill, the reason for the transformation,

188
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
the practice of harmony, and the great achievement.

189
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The skill is the lowest.

190
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Maybe the fairy

191
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
who chose you

192
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
made a mistake

193
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
and gave you this chance.

194
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I don't have high cultivation

195
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
so I don't know how to use it.

196
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I was hurt before

197
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
and I don't remember many things.

198
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You drank my blood.

199
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Now you have

200
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
reached the stage of main skill.

201
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I have main skill now?

202
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Let's do it.

203
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Let's go.

204
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You are here.

205
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You are here.

206
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I am so tired.

207
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I need to rest.

208
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I need to rest.

209
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I need to rest.

210
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I need to rest.

211
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I need to rest.

212
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I need to rest.

213
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Come here.

214
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Why can't I lie flat in another world?

215
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Others say I'm the daughter of destiny.

216
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm the spirit of the archer.

217
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
No money, no holiday, and I have to see my boss's face.

218
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I used to knock the keyboard every day.

219
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Now I play the mother's cloth every day.

220
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Life can't be ruined.

221
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
At least half of happiness.

222
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm tired of it.

223
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I have to fight with the fierce child.

224
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You bastard.

225
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'll burn you to death.

226
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You can talk?

227
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Is there anything else here?

228
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Calm down.

229
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The fire of the immortal world is normal.

230
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Fire-scaled child.

231
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I'm also listening to the boss's arrangement.

232
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You should be more responsible.

233
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Good friend.

234
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Do you know who I am?

235
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I don't care who you are.

236
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I have to listen to the boss.

237
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Sorry.

238
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm a master of the master's profession.

239
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm fast.

240
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm just a teacher.

241
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
But your little girl is still good.

242
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I feel like my body is going to be controlled.

243
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Why is the child of the archer so exquisite?

244
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm tired of climbing the ghost building every day.

245
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
The work is more than cattle.

246
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
No salary, no contract, and pure.

247
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Fortunately, the boss often doesn't appear.

248
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
At the same time, the black snake is easy to get along with.

249
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Although the work partner likes to spit fire, it's easy to catch fire.

250
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'm going to burn you to death.

251
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It's not easy for me.

252
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I beg you.

253
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Don't teach me anymore.

254
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I feel so bad.

255
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I can't spit out the fire star.

256
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It should be almost.

257
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Si Ma Jiao said you are a disciple of the Geng Chen Xian.

258
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Then you can't give me water next time.

259
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I don't give you water.

260
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
How do I deal with my boss?

261
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You're not his woman.

262
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Do you still need to spend time dealing with him?

263
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I ask you where did you get this conclusion?

264
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
He can bring it here.

265
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It must be his people.

266
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You are a woman.

267
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It's his woman.

268
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
There is no one else.

269
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's his woman.

270
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
What's wrong with that?

271
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
This logic is so miserable.

272
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Si Ma Jiao, don't look at me like that.

273
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It's your blood that feeds the fire.

274
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's Si Ma's destiny.

275
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Don't think you can get rid of me by training me.

276
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
We live and die together.

277
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You can't get rid of this destiny forever.

278
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It seems that the work environment of Sansheng Mountain is not so bad.

279
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The only thing that is not enough is that people don't eat or drink during the festival.

280
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
If I can order food, I will have a lot of fun.

281
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Again?

282
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Boss.

283
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Boss, you must keep a certain distance from him.

284
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Nonsense.

285
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You are the one who serves people like this.

286
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I have already worked very hard, okay?

287
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Speaking of this, it seems that we have never discussed the labor contract.

288
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Although there is no labor law here,

289
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
we still have to pay for it.

290
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Say it.

291
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
What do you want?

292
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It's not possible for you to get paid.

293
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You must guarantee the double-wage every week.

294
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
You still want this?

295
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Then, double-wage is not okay.

296
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Single-wage is also okay.

297
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Continue to water the plants. Don't think about stealing.

298
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I heard that you have been here for five hundred years.

299
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Whether it's people or fire,

300
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
it's easy to get sick if you stay in one place for a long time.

301
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It's all Si Ma's fault.

302
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Si Ma Jiao?

303
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Such a low-class name.

304
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It's too contrasted with the ancestors.

305
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Idiot! It's Jiao.

306
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Jiao from the Shaojiao.

307
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
That's right.

308
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Why are you so angry?

309
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I'm not angry.

310
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'm just worried about you.

311
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'm worried about you.

312
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Why are you so angry?

313
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
No wonder the ancestors said that you wanted to kill people when you were arrogant.

314
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
That's because he framed me.

315
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
He and I don't have any common sense.

316
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You water me and make me suffer.

317
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
He doesn't think it's easier.

318
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Then, I'm not working without filial piety.

319
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Such a good opportunity.

320
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Why don't you steal the blood lily?

321
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You stinky woman!

322
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You stinky woman!

323
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
How do you know the truth?

324
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I'm sorry.

325
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Stop it!

326
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Compared with your evil power,

327
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I must be inferior to the evil ancestors.

328
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
The company is cruel.

329
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
One day, when I recover,

330
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'll burn you to ashes

331
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
and beat Si Ma Jiao to death.

332
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
My flower!

333
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Si Ma Jiao!

334
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I've been running for my whole life.

335
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I've been raising flowers with your blood.

336
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Don't you want to steal your own blood?

337
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Pick it up.

338
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Do you know what this is?

339
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
This is...

340
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
This is a flower.

341
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
This is a flower.

342
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
This is a flower.

343
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
This is a flower.

344
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
What is this?

345
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
This is...

346
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
This is a flower?

347
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
A flower.

348
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Do you want it?

349
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You've made the flowers into this.

350
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Why do I need it?

351
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It seems that you don't know anything.

352
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
That's how they let you in.

353
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Yes.

354
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
No one told me anything.

355
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It's mainly because I'm not familiar with the teachers and students.

356
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
They don't know anything about the inner world.

357
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Moreover, the more they know, the faster they die.

358
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
This flower is for you.

359
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
He's so generous to you.

360
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Generous?

361
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
This petal is pretty, but why would I use it?

362
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You don't know?

363
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
This is a flower from Mount Feng.

364
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
A petal is a thousand years of cultivation.

365
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
The whole of the Xian Manor of Gengchen has been treating it like a piece of trash.

366
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
This should be considered a salary.

367
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
As long as you help me, I'll give you more petals.

368
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
No need.

369
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Thank you.

370
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
A man's heart is not enough to swallow a snake.

371
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
To be honest, I'm not very brave to use a petal like this.

372
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
What if I can't stand it and die?

373
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
There are many such tricks in novels.

374
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I'm done with my work today.

375
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I'll get off work now.

376
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Bye.

377
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Don't go.

378
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Talk to me for a while.

379
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
You...

380
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You're leaving already?

381
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I'm done with my work.

382
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Can't I leave?

383
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Who said you're done?

384
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I want you to shut up.

385
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
What work are you looking for?

386
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
If you don't want to die, then follow me.

387
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
You don't need to do any work today.

388
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
You just need to learn a method of killing.

389
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Kill?

390
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I don't want to learn, okay?

391
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
If you don't want to learn, then I'll kill you.

392
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
What?

393
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I'm not going to kill you.

394
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I'm going to kill you.

395
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I'm going to kill you.

396
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Huh?

397
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Take it.

398
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Pull it out.

399
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
The spiritual energy of the immortal palace

400
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
needs to be given to the spiritual power.

401
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Only then can it be used.

402
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
But I don't know how to use the spiritual power.

403
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Why do I have to learn how to kill?

404
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
You'll definitely be sent to the battlefield in the future.

405
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Huh?

406
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I...

407
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Grand Master,

408
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
let me confirm something with you first.

409
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
So that we won't have a hard time

410
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
getting along in the future.

411
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Say it.

412
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
That...

413
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Look at you.

414
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
You fed me blood.

415
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
You kept me alive

416
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
and saved me.

417
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
You kept me by your side

418
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
and taught me how to use magic.

419
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
There are so many people on this mountain.

420
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Yet you're so special to me.

421
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Could it be...

422
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
that you like me?

423
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
You're just a little brother who lives in the machine.

424
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
You're talking about liking me.

425
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
You're really ridiculous.

426
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I look pretty good now.

427
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I'm not that ridiculous.

428
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
And what does liking have to do with cultivation?

429
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
How can the love of the mortal be in my eyes?

430
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
That's not certain.

431
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
The old house caught fire in an instant.

432
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I don't know.

433
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
If it weren't for your body

434
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
and your spirit that brought me here,

435
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
you think you could live till now?

436
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
So I'm a moving air conditioner.

437
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I was thinking too much.

438
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Si Ma Jiao really doesn't have feelings.

439
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
That's good.

440
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Bye!

441
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
The flag has fallen.

442
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
It's been 500 years.

443
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
It's all coming to an end.

444
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
What's wrong?

445
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I heard that a disciple named Liao Ting Yan

446
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
could enter the Central Tower without any hindrance.

447
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
That was the work of Mu Ni Sheng from the Heaven's Palace.

448
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
We tried our best

449
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
to get close to Si Ma Jiao.

450
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
How did he do it?

451
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
It doesn't matter.

452
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
What matters is that the barrier outside the Central Tower

453
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
can't be broken.

454
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
That Liao Ting Yan could enter and leave at will.

455
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Could it be...

456
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Could the barrier be broken?

457
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
In this way,

458
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
we can move around.

459
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Ting Yan has won the award of Si Ma Jiao.

460
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Earplugs.

461
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
The workers must sleep with them.

462
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Senior Brother, didn't we agree

463
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
that you can drink directly when you come?

464
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
You don't have to wake me up.

465
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
You don't have to wake me up when you leave either.

466
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Because of you,

467
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I haven't slept for several nights.

468
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
It's not good to be too polite when you're with me.

469
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Forget it.

470
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I guess you don't understand.

471
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
This feeling...

472
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
It's like...

473
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I've been busy with work for a day.

474
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I have to be warmly welcomed by my colleagues for dinner.

475
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I can't afford to make you angry. I can't avoid it.

476
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
No one will bother me again, right?

477
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Ming Li,

478
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
you dare to threaten me?

479
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Young Master is really a good teacher.

480
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Cut the crap.

481
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Where's the antidote?

482
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
The barrier between us is still there.

483
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
It seems that the fire is not extinguished yet.

484
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I'll go and check.

485
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I'll go and check.

486
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
The barrier between us is still there.

487
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
It seems that the fire is not extinguished yet.

488
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Si Ma Jiao is still alive.

489
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
How can I give it to you?

490
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I've sent the people in.

491
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Whether you succeed or not

492
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
depends on the fate of your Demon Citadel.

493
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
What does it have to do with me?

494
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Young Princess,

495
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
we are partners on the same boat.

496
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Since you don't give me the antidote,

497
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I'll expose Liao Ting Yan's identity

498
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
and make your plan fail.

499
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Without Liao Ting Yan,

500
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
the Demon Citadel will not be in vain.

501
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
But you, Young Princess,

502
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
the traitors of the Qian Manor hate the Demon Citadel the most.

503
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
If your father knew that

504
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
you colluded with the Demon Citadel to improve your cultivation,

505
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
what would you do?

506
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
So from the beginning,

507
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
you pretended to help me improve my cultivation

508
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
and let me relax.

509
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
In fact,

510
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
to control me with the poison,

511
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
so that I can do things for you,

512
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
it was all a scam from the beginning.

513
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Young Princess,

514
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
you can't say that.

515
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
You were the one who took the initiative to join us.

516
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
The only thing you can do now

517
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
is to find a way to make Liao Ting Yan stop moving as soon as possible.

518
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
No, it's coming again.

519
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
What is Liao Ting Yan doing?

520
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
If I let Ting Yan help me find a chance to get close to the Sima River,

521
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
would he think that I was trying to get close to him from the beginning?

522
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
But if I can't kill the Sima River again,

523
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
my people will...

524
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Why is the black snake here?

525
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
That's where Ting Yan lives.

526
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Help!

527
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Ting Yan!

528
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Oh no, that beast...

529
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
You bastard!

530
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
You did everything by having your master to support you.

531
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Liao Ting Yan didn't do anything.

532
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Why are you eating her?

533
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Take her out!

534
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Okay.

535
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Since you don't listen to me,

536
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
don't blame me for being rude.

537
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
You bastard!

538
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
You bastard!

539
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
You bastard!

540
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
You bastard!

541
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I'm not polite.

542
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Did I just pass by like a fool?

543
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
You're not listening to me?

544
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
You bastard!

545
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:23,600
scene of Nicolas and the

546
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,200
Brother Snake, what's wrong?

547
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,200
Ting Yan, you're still alive?

548
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,480
Shuling,

549
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,400
I was wondering

550
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,040
why you ran out of Brother Snake's belly.

551
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,480
I thought he ate you

552
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,880
and wanted to save you.

553
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,120
But he didn't.

554
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,320
He ate you.

555
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,320
He ate you.

556
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,800
He wanted to save you.

557
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,480
But he accidentally swallowed you.

558
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,920
Shuling,

559
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,880
you almost became Brother Snake's dinner for me.

560
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,920
I took his snake heart.

561
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,080
Is there any misunderstanding?

562
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,120
It's good that he's a snake.

563
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,720
Maybe...

564
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,560
Maybe he's not mean.

565
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,680
But I think

566
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,480
he's used to it.

567
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,680
I'll keep this snake heart for you.

568
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,360
If you still dare to scare people,

569
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,200
I'll let you be a black snake

570
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,480
who has no snake heart for a lifetime.

571
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,320
You're in the snake's belly and being controlled by the black things.

572
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,160
I'm in the center tower and being controlled by the black things.

573
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,400
Life is so hard.

574
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,920
But

575
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,760
Master has been kind to you, right?

576
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,840
I was thinking

577
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,960
to take your light

578
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,720
and take care of Master.

579
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,920
How did the rumors spread?

580
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,360
Kindness?

581
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,280
He's just using my labor.

582
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,240
Why do you want to please him?

583
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,520
Can't I?

584
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:24,000
Or you don't want to introduce me to Master?

585
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,560
I don't want to.

586
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,720
He's a stable man.

587
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,000
What if he's not happy and kills you?

588
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,920
I don't want to push my good friend into the fire pit.

589
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,880
Are you worried about me?

590
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,280
I thought...

591
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,240
Nothing.

592
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,080
Why did you come back?

593
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,120
Master.

594
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,480
I'm here for you.

595
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,040
Thank you.

596
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,480
Your brother.

597
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,840
Don't talk nonsense.

598
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,120
How is he when he is the third of your social class?

599
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,280
Somebody took off yourärtiner.

600
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,800
Who would support for you now?

601
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,960
The full moon is here.

602
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,960
It's not far away from the time we've been gone.

603
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,040
Brother, you're here.

604
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,040
Please sit.

605
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,840
Brother, I want to ask you something.

606
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,440
You've been with Shizu for so long.

607
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,240
You must know his hobby.

608
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,040
What if I want to please Shizu?

609
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,240
Shizu, look at this table.

610
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,040
I've put a lot of light on it.

611
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,240
And this floor.

612
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,840
It's also very dark.

613
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,640
What do you want from me today?

614
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,440
I had a stomachache last night.

615
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,440
It almost killed me.

616
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:29,040
Didn't you save me with blood last time?

617
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,040
What do you want?

618
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,840
I want you to be with me.

619
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,040
I want to be with you.

620
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,240
I just want to know

621
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,240
if you can use your precious blood

622
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,440
to save me from danger.

623
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,440
After all, my small body

624
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,440
can help you.

625
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,840
Let's help each other, okay?

626
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,040
She passed away now?

627
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,240
Does she...

628
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,640
can do that?

629
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,920
I think that

630
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,040
she's better than me.

631
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,240
Talk about conditions with me.

632
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,960
The ancestors are pitiful.

633
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,360
Why do you need to think about this?

634
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:44,840
Kill someone.

635
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,360
Kill someone for me.

636
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,720
This is a bit too much.

637
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,200
Grand Master, don't leave.

638
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,680
Wait.

639
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,680
I will definitely find out your other needs.

640
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,240
Grand Master.

641
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,440
You've worked hard all morning.

642
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,840
I'm here to serve you.

643
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,160
I heard that you have a bad sleep.

644
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,360
Based on my years of experience in work,

645
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,800
most of the time, you are too worried and anxious.

646
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,160
Brother Snake,

647
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,800
how can I make Grand Master feel better?

648
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,840
Grand Master likes pillows.

649
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,640
Grand Master can't sleep well.

650
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,760
He can't sleep well.

651
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,680
Ridiculous.

652
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,560
What is there that I should worry about?

653
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,600
Anyway, I brought three sets of anti-stress.

654
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,640
They will be used with my unique massage techniques.

655
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,960
Why don't you try it?

656
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,080
Okay.

657
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,880
You are finally going to do something to me.

658
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,640
Don't worry, Song Ha.

659
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,080
Boss,

660
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,680
I'm so sincere in serving you.

661
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,400
I'm not doing anything else.

662
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,640
I just want to ask you

663
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,720
if I can discuss my treatment with you.

664
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,520
Treatment?

665
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,680
Treatment?

666
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,880
What is treatment?

667
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,360
It's for my blood again.

668
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,440
Yes.

669
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:41,960
And,

670
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,760
look,

671
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,720
I've been working for five days in a row.

672
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,760
I've been working for five days in a row.

673
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,240
Not to mention double repair.

674
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,720
I don't even have one.

675
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,680
Why did I make a mistake again?

676
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,320
Boss Tao Hao is so hard.

677
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,120
If I knew it,

678
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,040
I would have learned from my colleagues

679
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,680
in the workplace.

680
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,600
That evil spy

681
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,000
has helped me to relieve

682
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,880
many of the spiritual fire.

683
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,680
Maybe

684
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,280
I can break the seal by force.

685
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,200
Ma Xiu, are you crazy?

686
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,760
If you pretend to disappear,

687
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,200
you might die.

688
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,600
Ma Xiu!

689
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,800
Ma Xiu!
