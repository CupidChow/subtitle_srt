00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,500
Life is found.

6
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,080
That demon doctor is a profiteer.

7
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,920
But he helped me

8
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,360
to break through thekom paralysis.

9
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,820
You such a nonsense.

10
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,020
Duan silly.

11
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,380
Really arunning fishing place.

12
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,660
Didn't know it could are so beautiful.

13
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,340
Brother Snake.

14
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,580
The sunset is beautiful so beautiful.

15
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,380
Let's over there and have a look.

16
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,100
So many detail.

17
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,380
It's different.

18
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,380
Senior, what's wrong?

19
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,380
What's this?

20
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,860
Why does it look like

21
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,580
I can't breathe?

22
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,900
Sima Jiao, are you crazy?

23
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,820
Your mother can't force the seal to break.

24
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,100
It looks like a seal.

25
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,180
Could it be related to the Grand Master?

26
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,180
It's not.

27
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,220
It's not.

28
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,020
It's not.

29
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,820
It's not.

30
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,620
It's not.

31
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,380
It's not.

32
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,460
I know that girl

33
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,020
has relieved your pain.

34
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,420
But this is the seal

35
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,620
that the Eight-Six blood meridians have made together.

36
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,140
No one can break it.

37
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,900
If you act recklessly,

38
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,340
you might die.

39
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,660
Sima Jiao.

40
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,060
Look.

41
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,980
I told you it's not okay.

42
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,940
The more times you try to break the seal,

43
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,220
the deeper the nail in your body will be pierced.

44
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,100
Don't waste your energy.

45
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,180
Shut up.

46
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,500
Grand Master has been here for 500 years.

47
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,780
Could it be that

48
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,740
Grand Master didn't close the door here

49
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,380
but was sealed for 500 years?

50
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,020
Then Grand Master is not the Grand Master.

51
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,820
He is Sun Wukong.

52
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,140
No wonder he can't sleep and likes to be crazy.

53
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,300
He's locked up like this every day.

54
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,580
It's weird if he doesn't get crazy.

55
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,380
I'm not crazy.

56
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,900
I don't care about the world.

57
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,700
I don't care about the change.

58
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,260
I don't care about the change.

59
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,260
I know how to make you happy.

60
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,260
I don't care about the change.

61
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:06,260
I don't care about the change.

62
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,460
Grand Master.

63
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,500
Grand Master.

64
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,100
Grand Master.

65
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,380
Grand Master.

66
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,380
Why are you here?

67
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,980
The scar on Grand Master's body

68
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,980
was left by the seal?

69
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,780
Is this the place you can come in easily?

70
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,380
Sorry.

71
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,980
I didn't mean to come in.

72
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,980
Tell me.

73
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,380
What are you doing here?

74
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,580
I'm here to help you.

75
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,980
I'm here to help you.

76
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,180
What are you doing here?

77
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,780
I know you have something on your mind.

78
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,980
I want to see if I can please you.

79
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,380
What can I do?

80
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,380
But...

81
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,580
But I have an idea.

82
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,580
Maybe it can make you happy.

83
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,580
Make me happy?

84
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,380
I made it.

85
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,380
I made it with the cultivation you helped me improve.

86
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,780
How is it?

87
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,980
I improved your cultivation.

88
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,180
You can use it to do this.

89
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,980
It can make you happy.

90
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,380
Isn't it good?

91
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,780
It's good.

92
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,980
Really?

93
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,980
That's a great way to be a gentleman.

00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:03,420

95
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,380
вид nineteen

96
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,380
How is it?

97
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,380
Do you feel cooler?

98
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,180
Boss, boss

99
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,780
Boss Yan, you have such a beautiful face

100
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,060
Drag that woman down

101
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,100
One two three

102
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,740
You

103
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,740
Other than snow,

104
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,620
your cultivation

105
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,380
can do a lot for you.

106
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,340
New Moon Night

107
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,020
is coming.

108
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,580
I've been locked up here for 500 years.

109
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,740
You drank too much.

110
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,740
Your cultivation is suppressed.

111
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,780
You're tortured day in and day out.

112
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,020
Lingqiao Steamwhat exponential management

113
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:51,940
Steamed Ontario Steam what exponential management

114
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,500
as 있습니다

115
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,260
The Sima's quarters is indeed weak.

116
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,020
AirportIGH Tackers

117
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:54,980
this issue I must tell the palace J Iris.

118
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,540
Wait.

119
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,020
The threeboards of the mountain are the only places.

120
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,220
Si Ma Jiao is suspicious.

121
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,660
Besides, Liao Ting Yan

122
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,260
stays in the Central Tower every day.

123
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,780
We must make Liao Ting Yan

124
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,820
leave Si Ma Jiao

125
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,820
to avoid destroying the plan of the New Moon Night.

126
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,820
With his cultivation,

127
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,060
he can't become our obstacle.

128
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,340
Not now.

129
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,820
If he follows Si Ma Jiao to cultivate,

130
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,580
we are not his opponents.

131
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,660
So you mean...

132
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,500
A sword is double-edged, a golden cicada is broken.

133
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,060
If someone cares about Si Ma Jiao,

134
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,180
there is one in the Star Palace.

135
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,220
Sister, have you heard?

136
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,300
The disciple of the Fourth Master, Liao Ting Yan

137
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,820
will move into the Inner Palace soon.

138
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,540
He was just taken away by the Grand Master not long ago.

139
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,940
He lives with the Grand Master so soon.

140
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,660
What did this female cultivator do?

141
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,940
If he takes the lead,

142
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,060
our Star Palace will...

143
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,820
He can't do whatever he wants.

144
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,580
Let's go.

145
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,660
Brother,

146
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,500
look at me.

147
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,180
I used my magical skills

148
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,660
to restore your power.

149
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,380
You are still angry?

150
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,900
Trust me.

151
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,980
Lu Ling values friends.

152
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:17,940
Next time we meet,

153
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,380
I will take care of him for you.

154
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,900
I will take care of him for you.

155
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,180
I will take care of him for you.

156
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,380
I will take care of him for you.

157
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,260
Next time we meet,

158
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,780
I will take care of him for you.

159
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,700
He will return the snake heart to you.

160
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,700
What do you want?

161
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,460
You are not loyal to the Grand Master.

162
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,060
You are also ungrateful.

163
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,340
You are here to take the food and paint.

164
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,780
You are disrespectful to the Grand Master.

165
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,140
You don't need to talk to him.

166
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,580
It's important to do the official business.

167
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,020
I didn't offend you.

168
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,020
Just tell me the truth.

169
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,380
Don't do it, okay?

170
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,180
Cut the crap.

171
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,220
Sister, hurry up.

172
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:54,820
No.

173
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,460
Today,

174
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,140
I will teach you a lesson for the Grand Master.

175
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,940
I just want to be a salted fish.

176
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,940
Is it so hard?

177
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,700
They took Liao Ting Yan away

178
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,100
because they want to use him to force me to do it.

179
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,500
He is just a demon jade spy.

180
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,220
If he can help me to complete the grand plan,

181
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,980
he will hurt me.

182
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,980
It has nothing to do with me.

183
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,980
I told you I have nothing to do with you.

184
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:41,940
Besides,

185
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,340
how dare I take the idea of the new group?

186
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,180
There are so many people in the mountain.

187
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,940
Why did he choose you?

188
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,020
You must have some tricks.

189
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,300
Today,

190
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,100
I will teach you a lesson for the Grand Master.

191
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,460
How can an ordinary three-soul shield

192
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,300
be so difficult to deal with?

193
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,500
Sister,

194
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,020
we will lose our soul energy

195
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,460
if we force it.

196
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,660
It's over.

197
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,100
We can't care about it.

198
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,140
We are the enemies.

199
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,420
How can we die?

200
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:34,980
It's so hot.

201
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,180
You made it.

202
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,460
I used the cultivation power

203
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,300
you helped me to improve.

204
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,540
I helped you to improve your cultivation power.

205
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,780
That's all you can do?

206
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,940
It can make you happy.

207
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,940
Isn't it good?

208
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:51,700
Sister,

209
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,460
let's kill him now.

210
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,660
We will never regret it.

211
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:14,980
Grand Master.

212
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,420
How can you be so careless?

213
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,020
I'll take you back to duty.

214
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,580
Have mercy, Grand Master.

215
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,940
Have mercy, Grand Master.

216
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,420
It's not easy, but life is a little enjoyable.

217
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,820
You ruined it.

218
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,220
Why did you kill her?

219
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,060
Grand Master.

220
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,300
She would only have her sect in Hongshan Ro limited in village length,

221
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,980
but our cultivation power is quite low.

222
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,020
And I

223
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,940
I'm here to serve you.

224
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:18,900
How can I let such a bad thing

225
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,300
I'm here to become the concubine of the Grand Master.

226
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,300
I want to have a child with the blood of the Sima family.

227
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,100
Once the blood of the Fengshan Clan has a successor,

228
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,100
we will kill the Grand Master,

229
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,900
take the spiritual fire,

230
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,100
and solve a big problem for the Immortal of Gengchen.

231
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,300
And our Star Palace

232
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,100
will become the master of the Immortal of Gengchen.

233
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,300
I'm here to become the concubine of the Grand Master.

234
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,700
I'm here to become the concubine of the Sima family.

235
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,900
And I can become the next generation of princess.

236
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,100
What about you? What are you here for?

237
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,300
I hate Yun Xi Yue.

238
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,300
I'm here to take her chance.

239
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,300
After so many years,

240
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,100
you still have the same ungrateful tricks.

241
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,300
The blood of the Immortal of Gengchen might not be able to produce one.

242
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:21,700
Once I die, the whole Gengchen's house will be ruined.

243
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,700
What princess? What master?

244
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,900
All of you must die with me.

245
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,700
Understand?

246
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,700
Grand Master, I...

247
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,300
We're so Incorrable.

248
00:16:50,300 --> 00:17:16,460
We were either knocked up by the

249
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,020
But I think

250
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,620
after we adopt him,

251
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,380
we can't just let it go.

252
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,860
Why not?

253
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,360
Just set something in practice to us

254
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,860
and try to release it off.

255
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,260
We'll just have to

256
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,900
re-inexport him,

257
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,620
and try to take digitization of � phone placements dans le Royale

258
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:45,880
No!

259
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,260
Hao'er,

260
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,680
this grass...

261
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,760
Don't touch it!

262
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:52,820
Kollae.

263
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,700
It's walking on a target of teenwood!

264
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,180
It looks harsh.

265
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,640
When I do something,

266
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,020
it should be all under the earth!

267
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,040
How about someone else doing it?

268
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,340
Oh, no!

269
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,960
How about my brother?

270
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,060
He's doing better.

271
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,680
My brother seems good.

272
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:12,660
By what?

273
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,360
By himself.

274
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,300
It's Xiyue and Wanqing.

275
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,780
He didn't even leave any stone.

276
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,740
How could he do such a thing?

277
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,620
Does he really have no concern?

278
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,140
What concern can he have?

279
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,980
The disciples of Mount Songjing

280
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,860
were all killed.

281
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,580
If he hadn't been trapped in the Three-Horn Mountain,

282
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,620
I'm afraid

283
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,820
we would have been killed by him

284
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,340
in the whole Gengchen Immortal's Mansion.

285
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,220
Another battle is over.

286
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,340
It's Yinzhi's.

287
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,200
The

288
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,580
Princess.

289
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,180
I came here with the soul of death

290
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,300
to send you a message.

291
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,620
What's the important news?

292
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,660
We sneaked into

293
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,220
the Central Tower of the Grand Master.

294
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,180
New Moon Night

295
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,580
is coming.

296
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,020
I've been locked here for 500 years.

297
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,420
The cultivation is suppressed.

298
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,980
I'm tortured day by day.

299
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,580
And the first New Moon Night

300
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,100
is the weakest time for me.

301
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,540
You have to protect me.

302
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,580
Otherwise,

303
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,460
I'll die.

304
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,220
The New Moon Night is the weakest thing

305
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,060
that he has been in for 500 years.

306
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,580
The

307
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,020
The

308
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,020
The

309
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:21,980
Grand Master

310
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,300
is the only one who can

311
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,380
support the fire of Mount Feng.

312
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,060
If someone

313
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,700
uses this to harm the Grand Master,

314
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,460
what should we do?

315
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,380
Everyone knows

316
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,420
how strong the Grand Master is.

317
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,300
When he was in his prime,

318
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,500
our father and father

319
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,900
used all their strength

320
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,500
to seal him

321
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,860
in the mountain

322
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,860
with the blood of the Eight Palace.

323
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:44,700
Princess Ying,

324
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,060
you were also involved in it.

325
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:47,980
You know it best.

326
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,780
A New Moon Night

327
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,620
will really make him weak to death?

328
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,060
When you look at the New Moon Night,

329
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,380
will the spiritual vein weaken?

330
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,500
If the Grand Master is really weak,

331
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,140
the whole spiritual vein of the Immortal Gengchen

332
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,740
will naturally weaken.

333
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,020
The seal of the Grand Master's body

334
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,500
makes him unable to shoot himself.

335
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,700
This is not true.

336
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:11,980
Everyone,

337
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,220
this matter is about the Grand Master

338
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,940
and the whole Immortal Gengchen.

339
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,380
Tomorrow is the New Moon Night.

340
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,860
If there is any change in the spiritual vein,

341
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,100
everyone must take care of it in time.

342
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,620
Tian Yan,

343
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,380
you're awake.

344
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,300
Ruo Ling.

345
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,820
When I arrived,

346
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,620
you were already lying on the ground.

347
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,300
I didn't know what happened.

348
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,380
But I smelled

349
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,180
blood everywhere.

350
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,260
Maybe

351
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,260
a disciple

352
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,380
made the Grand Master angry

353
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,020
and was killed by him.

354
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,820
Although Sima Jiao

355
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,980
is a little crazy,

356
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,380
when I came to know him,

357
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,140
I found that he wasn't a person who committed suicide.

358
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,660
I remember now.

359
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,620
Before I fainted,

360
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,580
the people of the New Moon Night were looking for me.

361
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,020
I was injured.

362
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,980
But I just checked it.

363
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:30,100
There are no signs of injury on your body.

364
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,380
Did Sima Jiao save me?

365
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,380
The Grand Master can save people?

366
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,380
Could it be...

367
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,700
Could it be the Grand Master

368
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,460
really

369
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,140
has other intentions for you?

370
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,860
Impossible.

371
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,220
It must be because I am his moving air conditioner.

372
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,620
I can lower his temperature

373
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,740
and reduce the burning sensation of the spiritual fire.

374
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,740
Spiritual fire is not a mortal thing.

375
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,820
Tian Yan's body can actually lower Sima Jiao's temperature.

376
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,180
Could it be

377
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,020
the body of the Demon Lord from the Demon Citadel?

378
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,020
I see.

379
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,580
By the way,

380
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,940
thanks to that little black snake

381
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,340
who sent me a letter today,

382
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,660
I arrived in time.

383
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,500
Speaking of the snake,

384
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,140
he is actually quite nice.

385
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,780
Last time, it was a misunderstanding.

386
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,340
Ru Ling,

387
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:38,100
can you return the snake heart to him?

388
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,060
I don't want to see him in my dream again!

389
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,300
Okay.

390
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,500
Ru Ling,

391
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,620
you're really being silly.

392
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,140
It's okay.

393
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,900
I am fine.

394
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,860
The snake heart is back to me.

395
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,180
Thank God in Heaven that Tian Yan is safe and sound.

396
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,380
I shall thank that black snake.

397
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:14,180
I thought you took my friend Ting Yan away from me.

398
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,180
That's why I misunderstood you.

399
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,180
Today, I'll apologize to you.

400
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:24,180
I heard that you like to drink this.

401
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,180
So I brought it here.

402
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,180
Do you want this?

403
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,180
I'll go get it.

404
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,180
You are...

405
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,180
Brother Snake.

406
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:16,180
What did you do to me?

407
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,180
I received this snake heart.

408
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,180
After I got this snake heart,

409
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,180
I kept collecting it.

410
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,180
I didn't do anything to it.

411
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,180
I've become a human.

412
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,180
Ru Lin, Ru Lin, it's all thanks to you.

413
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,180
Ru Lin, Ru Lin.

414
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:36,180
Look at me. I've been waiting for this day for a long time.

415
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,180
Really. Thank you, Ru Lin.

416
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,180
Although I don't know what method you used,

417
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,180
I've become a human today.

418
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,180
Thank you.

419
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,180
Ru Lin, thank you.

420
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:13,180
You gave me a chance to be a human.

421
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,180
Tomorrow night is the New Moon Night.

422
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,180
I'll be with you.

423
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,180
I'll be with you.

424
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,180
I'll be with you.

425
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,180
I'll be with you.

426
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,180
I'll be with you.

427
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,180
This chance...

428
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,180
I can't miss it.

429
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,180
Grand Master.

430
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,180
It's me.

431
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,180
I've become a human.

432
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,180
I'm Ye Ru Lin.

433
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,180
After he returned my heart,

434
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,180
I don't know what I did

435
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,180
to become a human.

436
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,180
You drank so much blood.

437
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,180
You could've become a human long ago.

438
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,180
That's right.

439
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,180
That's right.

440
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:32,180
Grand Master used his own blood to feed me.

441
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,180
So I could get back one life.

442
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:37,180
Grand Master, my life is over.

443
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,180
You gave me my life.

444
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,180
I'll follow you to the end.

445
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:55,180
Since you've become a human,

446
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,180
you should learn to be a good human.

447
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,180
Ting Yan said so too.

448
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:03,180
He told me not to lick his fingers.

449
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,180
He also told me to learn to love myself

450
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,180
and to respect myself.

451
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,180
But Grand Master,

452
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,180
I don't know how to be a human.

453
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,180
You went to see him first?

454
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,180
Yes.

455
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,180
Thanks to Ting Yan,

456
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,180
Ru Lin returned my heart.

457
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,180
I went to thank Ting Yan.

458
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,180
Grand Master,

459
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,180
Ting Yan is a good friend.

460
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,180
Friend?

461
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,180
He's a kind person.

462
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,180
You go guard the gate at the New Moon Night.

463
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,180
Yes.

464
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,180
Grand Master,

465
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,180
do you stay here every day?

466
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:04,180
Why do you want to see Grand Master so much?

467
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,180
Grand Master used his own strength to feed me.

468
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:11,180
He made me have endless spiritual power.

469
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,180
I've always been a fan of Grand Master.

470
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,180
It's also the honor of our Heavenly Palace.

471
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,180
But he's so cold-hearted.

472
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,180
Aren't you afraid that he'll kill you?

473
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,180
Even if Grand Master kills me,

474
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,180
I have no regrets.

475
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,180
Are these cultivators

476
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,180
so dead?

477
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,180
I can't do it.

478
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,180
It's so good to be alive.

479
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,180
Why do I have to die for others?

480
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,180
If I have a chance to live,

481
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,180
I will try my best.

482
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,180
Boss,

483
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,180
it's early in the morning. Don't scare me.

484
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,180
How dare you be so timid?

485
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,180
So you'd better not

486
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,180
arrange too much work for me.

487
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,180
Otherwise, I'll be responsible for you

488
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,180
after I get injured.

489
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,180
You want me to be responsible for you?

490
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,180
You're not that ambitious.

491
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,180
Grand Master,

492
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,180
you're good at drawing.

493
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,180
You follow my lead.

494
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,180
What style of magic is that?

495
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,180
You are using

496
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,180
that stupid snake to demonize me, aren't you?

497
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,180
You're wronged.

498
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,180
I'm not good at it. You know that.

499
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,180
This is Qiushan Scheme.

500
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,180
Right.

501
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,180
Pardon me.

502
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,180
Which method is it?

503
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,180
I'm just making a horse-riding joke for you.

504
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,180
Wearing a high hat and touching your feet.

505
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:05,180
Your tricks are so unbecoming.

506
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,180
Then you're very useful.

507
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,180
It's a pity that I don't like wearing hats.

508
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:12,180
My feet are not smelly and I don't need to raise my horse.

509
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,180
Your tricks are going to be exposed.

510
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,180
I...

511
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,180
Stop.

512
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:46,180
How's your practice of the trick I taught you last time?

513
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,180
It's not that bad.

514
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:01,180
How's your practice of the trick I taught you last time?

515
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,180
It's not that bad.

516
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:06,180
How's your practice of the trick I taught you last time?

517
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:08,180
It's not that bad.

518
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,180
You're so good at it.

519
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,180
I think you should learn it from me.

520
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,180
I'm not good at it.

521
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,180
I'm sorry.

522
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,180
Your Highness.

523
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,180
Why did you just go outside?

524
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,180
I was worried that you'd be more nervous.

525
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:30,180
Remember, when you want to kill someone in the future,

526
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:33,180
it's best to stab this person.

527
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:35,180
If you still don't remember,

528
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,180
stab this person.

529
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,180
Have you learned it?

530
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,180
I've learned it.

531
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,180
Thank you, Master.

532
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,180
Then...

533
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:14,180
I'll go water the fire temple first.

534
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,180
No difference.

535
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:30,180
I like it if you like it.

536
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:44,180
Princesses, don't panic.

537
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,680
To preventÁ

538
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,180
I've already planned

539
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,180
waiting for an early death,

540
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,180
haven't I?

541
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:56,180
I'm just a minor adult. I'm not good at it.

542
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:59,180
You're as evil as a worm.

543
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,180
Then why are you here?

544
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,180
I'm here to protect you.

545
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,180
Protect me?

546
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,180
It sounds like it.

547
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,180
But in reality,

548
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:12,180
some people don't care about you.

549
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,180
Some people want to take advantage of your weakness

550
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:16,180
to take the Blood Flower.

551
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:19,180
Some people want to take advantage of your magic

552
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:22,180
to get your favor.

553
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,180
That's good.

554
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:26,180
I'm just afraid that some people

555
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,180
are afraid that you'll get into trouble.

556
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:30,180
They want to protect you first

557
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:32,180
and then harm you.

558
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,180
Princess Yue,

559
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:36,180
don't be so cruel.

560
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,180
We all need to rely on you.

561
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,180
How can someone harm you?

562
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,180
Who knows?

563
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,180
There will be some people who don't care about the situation.

564
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,180
You...

565
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,180
You two,

566
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:48,180
don't be so rude.

567
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:50,180
Don't be so rude.

568
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,180
No matter what,

569
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:54,180
we just hope that you're safe

570
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:57,180
and that you can keep your spirit.

571
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,180
I'm here.

572
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,180
I won't stop you.

573
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:05,180
Please be kind.

574
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,180
Please.

575
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,180
I still feel something is wrong.

576
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:12,180
What if the secret message is a fake one?

577
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,180
What if the Master deceives us

578
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,180
and kills us?

579
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,180
We'll be in danger.

580
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,180
How dare you think like that?

581
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,180
How can we get the blood-blooming flower?

582
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:23,180
Your worry is reasonable.

583
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,180
I'm here to tell you that

584
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,180
since it's the secret message

585
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,180
that I've been told,

586
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,180
I'll take care of it.

587
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,180
I'll send some elders

588
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,180
to protect the master.

589
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,180
What do you think?

590
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,180
Are you going to rush in

591
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:38,180
and take the blood-blooming flower?

592
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,180
Please, Princess Ying.

593
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:21,180
The blood-blooming flower grows like this.

594
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,180
Have you eaten the blood-blooming flower

595
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,180
that I gave you?

596
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,180
No.

597
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,180
The blood-blooming flower

598
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,180
needs to have my blood to be able to use.

599
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:02,180
Otherwise, people will be blown up into blood.

600
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,180
You've drunk my blood.

601
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,180
Don't worry.

602
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,180
It's too precious.

603
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,180
I can't bear to use it.

604
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,180
Why don't you eat it?

605
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,180
A cup of coffee

606
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,180
will increase the spirit of each stone.

607
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,180
This petal of flower

608
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,180
will increase my cultivation for a thousand years.

609
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,180
I'm afraid I'll die.

610
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,180
What if I insist on you eating it?

611
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,180
I won't eat it either.

612
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,180
I bet

613
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,180
to see if you'll kill me.

614
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:38,180
Can you say such sincere words?

615
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:46,180
Then I'll follow your advice.

616
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:51,180
Su Song, what's wrong with you today?

617
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,180
Do you think

618
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,180
I'm easy to talk to today?

619
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,180
You're the reason.

620
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,180
Because

621
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,180
I'm going to die.

622
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,180
You're not the one

623
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,180
who's going to die.

624
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,180
I'm not the one who's going to die.

625
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,180
I'm the one who's going to die.

626
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,180
You guys

627
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,180
want to kill me?

628
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,180
What are you waiting for?

629
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,180
Kill them together.

630
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,180
How come?

631
00:38:50,180 --> 00:39:08,200
You're not affected by the

632
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,180
You're not affected by the

633
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,180
good chance to kill me.

634
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:24,180
It's a good chance to kill me.

635
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,180
It's just

636
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,180
I'm weak.

637
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:52,180
You're too weak for me.

638
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,180
Boss,

639
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,180
when you say such

640
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,180
bitter words,

641
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,180
your mouth is bleeding.

642
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,180
Liao Ting Yan

643
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,180
is not a good person.

644
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,180
I'm afraid

645
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,180
you'll die.

646
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,180
I'm afraid

647
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,180
you'll die.

648
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,180
I'm afraid

649
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,180
you'll die.

650
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,180
I'm afraid

651
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,180
you'll die.

652
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,180
I'm afraid

653
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,180
you'll die.

654
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,180
I'm afraid

655
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,180
you'll die.

656
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,180
I'm afraid

657
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,180
you'll die.

658
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:27,180
I'm in a great state of

659
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,180
grief.

660
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,180
This is a good chance

661
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,180
for you.

662
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,180
I know it.

663
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,580
to give you a good chance.

664
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,500
Boss, are you satisfied?

665
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,260
Who is that?

666
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,380
Si Ma Jiao has no resistance.

667
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,460
Take a few arrows and kill him.

668
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,060
I won't kill anyone.

669
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,740
If he doesn't die, you will die.

670
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,900
More people will die in the future.

671
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,500
Do it now.

672
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,460
He's right.

673
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:17,820
Go.

674
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,820
Take out the arrow.

675
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,420
Boss, why do you need the arrow?

676
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,900
Do you remember how I taught you?

677
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,180
I remember.

678
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,780
I remember.

679
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:51,420
I remember.

I remember.

I remember.

685
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:57,900
I remember.

686
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:58,900
I remember.

687
00:42:58,900 --> 00:42:59,900
I remember.

688
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:00,900
I remember.

689
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:01,900
I remember.

690
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:02,900
I remember.

00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:03,900
I remember.

I remember.

696
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:08,900
I remember.

697
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:09,900
I remember.

698
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:10,900
I remember.

I remember.

I remember.

I remember.

702
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:14,900
I remember.

703
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:15,900
I remember.

704
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:16,900
I remember.

705
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:17,900
I remember.

706
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:18,900
I remember.

707
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:19,900
I remember.

708
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:20,900

I remember.

I remember.

711
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:23,900
I remember.

712
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:24,900
I remember.

713
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:25,900
I remember.

714
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:26,900
I remember.

715
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:27,900
I remember.

716
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:28,900
I remember.

717
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:29,900
I remember.

718
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:30,900
I remember.

719
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:31,900

I remember.

734
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:49,900
For you, for me,

735
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:53,900
for the rest of my life,

736
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,900
the sea is warm,

737
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,900
the rain is pouring,

738
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:01,900
and I'm covered in the rain.

739
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:05,900
For you, for me,

740
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:09,900
for the devotion of my life,

741
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,900
I face the promise,

742
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,900
as if flying,

743
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:19,900
I'll light up the sky with my body.

744
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:25,900
I'll get off.
