00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,700
 ♫ Heavens strike with thunderous wrath ♫ 

2
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,420
 ♫ Mountains and rivers shatter before my eyes ♫ 

3
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,780
 ♫ Endless splendor
cultivated through lifetimes ♫ 

4
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,380
 ♫ Turns to dust between my fingers
in an instant ♫ 

5
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,220
 ♫ When the line
between good and evil is clear ♫ 

6
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,340
 ♫ Countless souls drift
into the boundless wilds ♫

00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,500
 ♫ Carrying the spirit fire forward ♫

00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,580
 ♫ I defy fate ♫

 ♫ Just to remain by your side ♫

 ♫ Falling into love's abyss ♫ 

11
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,860
 ♫ Like heavy rain pouring down ♫

 ♫ Drunk on romance ♫

 ♫ In a blink, love and hate

00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,340
 ♫ Falling into endless love ♫ 

15
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,620
 ♫ Stirring waves upending a lifetime ♫

00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,860
 ♫ Even if this life leads to ruin ♫ 

17
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,020
 ♫ I still choose to be entangled with you ♫ 

18
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,125
 ♫ Through all lifetimes ♫ 

19
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:36,580
 

20
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,540
 

21
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:51,960
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

22
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:59,140
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

23
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:06,970
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

24
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,390
The original form of the Winter City Lord

25
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,110
is actually a black serpent.

26
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,590
Do you think when he takes human form,

27
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,770
he's just as imposing?

28
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,990
I see you've got your eyes
on his cultivation again.

29
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,960
Shush. Don't let anyone hear that.

30
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,080
Can't believe the leader
has such a pretty face.

31
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,640
He's quite good-looking.

32
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,710
Here's the deal.

33
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,240
The man is yours, the serpent is mine.

34
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,020
What are you on about?

35
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,640
This black serpent lord is amazing.

36
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,760
In just ten days, he's taken
nearly ten cities in the Demon Realm.

37
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,830
Exactly.

38
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,270
After all, behind him

39
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,700
is the Grandmaster
of Celestial Palace, Sima Jiao.

40
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,640
He's Sima Jiao?

41
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,210
We mustn't speak
the Lord of Mercy's name directly.

42
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,550
I thought this would be a good fate.

43
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,960
Turns out he's your archenemy.

44
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,920
Isn't Sima Jiao supposed to be

45
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,360
a gigantic, grotesque monster?

46
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,580
Why does he look like a pretty boy?

47
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,480
- Qian Lv.
- Qian Du.

48
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,370
What happened to you?

49
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,800
All because of Sima Jiao.

50
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,930
I'm forced to live in this pathetic way.

51
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,870
What about you?

52
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:19,780
Your journey must've been full of dangers.

53
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,490
I've been avoiding
the demonic cultivators all along the way.

54
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,340
I heard Sima Jiao has already
entered Celestial Crane City.

55
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,880
He came fast.

56
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,230
Sima Jiao has fused with the new Spirit Fire.

57
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,350
He's stronger than before.

58
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,760
Along the way, he's killed many of our clan.

59
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,080
I believe he'll find us in no time.

60
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,520
Qian Du, no matter how powerful Sima Jiao is,

61
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:57,030
he still can't withstand
someone we hold against him.

62
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,100
Do you mean...

63
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,880
Liao Ting Yan?

64
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,220
Exactly.

65
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:35,030
Liao Ting Yan possesses the extreme-cold nature

66
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,320
that can suppress Sima Jiao's Spirit Fire?

67
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,080
That's right.

68
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,320
After I brought her to the Demon Realm,

69
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:49,270
I performed the Soul Cleanse Spell
to erase her memory,

70
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,080
so she could be of use to me.

71
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,470
No wonder you didn't kill her 18 years ago.

72
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,740
You brought her here instead.

73
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,000
But why didn't her cold constitution

74
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,760
affect Sima Jiao at all,

75
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,740
even after staying with him so long?

76
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,880
She seemed to have forgotten
how to use her extreme-cold nature.

77
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,910
That's why I have to
cleanse her marrow regularly

78
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:19,120
to awaken her cold constitution,

79
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,710
so she'll be ready to kill Sima Jiao.

80
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,740
Father, I'm home.

81
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,320
You're back, Yan.

82
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,080
We have a guest?

83
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,120
Oh, you may continue your chat.

84
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,080
I... I forgot to buy vinegar.

85
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,080
Come here.

86
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,680
Let me introduce her.

87
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,760
My younger sister. Your aunt.

88
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,440
She's always cared for you

89
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,880
and came specially to see you.

90
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,460
 I thought this old grump was seeing someone. 

91
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,560
Really?

92
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,560
Come.

93
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,050
I watched you grow up.

94
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,880
Right. I remember now.

95
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,680
You came at the right time, Aunt.

96
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,760
Tonight, I'll prepare

97
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,830
the specialties of Celestial Crane City.

98
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,750
You can try them.

99
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,270
No need.

100
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:11,860
As long as the Shi family's unavenged,
how can I rest?

101
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,960
Father, you've heard

102
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,470
that Sima Jiao has claimed
Celestial Crane City, haven't you?

103
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,430
Yes.

104
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:27,760
But this isn't a bad thing.

105
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,890
This is your chance.

106
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,700
He's powerful.

107
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,280
I'd be dead if I confronted him.

108
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,160
Don't worry. It won't happen.

109
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,520
Your aunt came to help cleanse your marrow

110
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,550
to awaken your extreme-cold nature quickly.

111
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,870
Your strike is sure to succeed.

112
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,890
Again?

113
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,740
It really works.

114
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,860
We have to stop here.

115
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:28,900
Zhen Xu was killed by Sima Jiao.

116
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,320
How I hate that I can't avenge him myself.

117
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,350
You've done your best, Qian Lv.

118
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:39,470
Though her extreme-cold nature
isn't fully awakened,

119
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,590
it has greatly improved.

120
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:44,680
Besides, Sima Jiao still has feelings for her.

121
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,920
He won't suspect her.

122
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,040
I believe she'll succeed.

123
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,340
I'm not worried about her skill.

124
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,230
I'm worried she won't be able to
bring herself to do it.

125
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,530
In that case...

126
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,080
With this Nightmare Spell,

127
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,820
let's hope she can steel herself
to take revenge.

128
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,920
What are you doing early this morning?

129
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,920
Father, I dreamed of Zhen Xu last night.

130
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,920
It filled me with rage.

131
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,290
I wish I could find Sima Jiao and kill him now.

132
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,610
At least my efforts weren't for nothing.

133
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,110
Father, my power has grown stronger.

134
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,630
I might hurt you.

135
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:02,580
May I go stretch outside?

136
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,990
Go, but don't cause any trouble.

137
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,630
Come back early.

138
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,100
All right.

139
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,710
 Looks like he bought it. 

140
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,940
 Last night's nightmare was probably his doing. 

141
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:23,290
 All he can think about is revenge. 

142
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,320
 Wasn't this Yingluo necklace broken 

143
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,060
 during the thunder tribulation? 

144
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,710
 How is it even more beautiful now? 

145
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,920
 This artifact can withstand all harm. 

146
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,800
 Ting Yan. 

147
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,110
 Ting Yan! 

148
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,370
 Ting Yan! 

149
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,160
Grandmaster, the city lord
of Celestial Crane City

150
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,830
invites us to a banquet.

151
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,800
Will you go?

152
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,800
No.

153
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,400
Then I'll stay and keep your company.

154
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,400
Don't bother me.

155
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,110
Don't worry, Grandmaster.

156
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:52,560
We caused such a commotion
claiming Celestial Crane City,

157
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,160
and I showed my true form.

158
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,010
I believe Ting Yan will come to us soon.

159
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,160
But I'm not good at waiting.

160
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,490
I'm really good at lying low.

161
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,560
I can't wait to take my father

162
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,530
to Grain Rain Vale right now to hide.

163
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,940
Hands off.

164
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,630
Tube whistles like this one are everywhere.

165
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,960
Why do you care so much about it?

166
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,160
I don't know.

167
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,770
I just feel it's important to me.

168
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,470
Right now, what matters most to me
is saving enough money

169
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,040
and taking my father to Grain Rain Vale.

170
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,820
How about this?

171
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,530
I'll cover the rest.

172
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:48,440
I'll give you all my savings.

173
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,160
That should be enough.

174
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,180
Then we can leave together.

175
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,080
Haven't you been focused
on restoring your cultivation?

176
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,130
Why do you also want to leave?

177
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:05,990
In a place full of debauchery,

178
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:08,630
improving my cultivation
is only for self-protection.

179
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:11,460
If not for my poor health,

180
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,440
I would never have stayed here.

181
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,510
If you give me the money
meant to buy your freedom,

182
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,060
how will you get out of there?

183
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:24,110
Isn't the city lord of Winter City
a black serpent?

184
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,110
As long as I can get him on my side,

185
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,230
no one will dare stop me

186
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,590
from leaving this Rouge Terrace.

187
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:32,440
All right. I'll persuade my father right away.

188
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,710
I'll repay you the money slowly.

189
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,340
Don't treat me like an outsider.

190
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,770
Come on.

191
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,800
Please visit us more often.

192
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,750
Fill up.

193
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,160
- Please drink, my lord.
- Fill his cup.

194
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,350
- My lord, come.
- Let's drink.

195
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,100
Let's drink together.

196
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,630
Welcome, My Lord.

197
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,630
- I should've greeted you earlier.
- I should've greeted you earlier.

198
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,610
- Come on.
- Please.

199
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,750
Please visit us more often.

200
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,440
My Lord, let me toast you again.

201
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,200
- Pour more.
- Please.

202
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,510
Since you're here, let's all drink together.

203
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,750
- A toast to you.
- Let's drink.

204
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,080
Come.

205
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,400
Wonderful.

206
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,080
Please drink, My Lord.

207
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,290
My Lord, I'll give you a toast.

208
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,980
My Lord, this is
the most beautiful dancer here.

209
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,280
Bravo!

210
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,770
- Bravo!
- She's so beautiful.

211
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,340
Another drink.

212
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,940
Ru Ling.

213
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,700
Do I miss you this much?

214
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,740
My Lord...

215
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,860
Prepare a quiet room for me.

216
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,350
Here's a toast to you.

217
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,780
Let me refill your cup.

218
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,300
 

219
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,960
 

220
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,920
You're such a good drinker.

221
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,660
Have another drink.

222
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,420
Father.

223
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,840
I have something to discuss with you.

224
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,160
What is it?

225
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,960
I plan to take you to Grain Rain Vale.

226
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,990
I've nearly saved enough for the journey.

227
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:21,220
Once we're there,
you can rest and recover in peace.

228
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:33,840
Do you mean to cast our revenge aside?

229
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,400
You keep saying how cruel Sima Jiao is,

230
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,230
and that you must avenge Zhen Xu.

231
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:43,160
You should think of your daughter
who still lives.

232
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,330
Why must you force me into an impossible task?

233
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,940
Come here.

234
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,140
Come.

235
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,120
Spare me your nonsense.

236
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,550
Do you forget who killed your brother?

237
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,030
Who ruined me like this?

238
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,880
Who destroyed the Shi family?

239
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,990
I raised you all these years,

240
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,250
and now you say I force you into deeds?

241
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,850
You disappoint me.

242
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,380
Father, I only wish for our future.

243
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,960
Please come with me.

244
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,510
We can talk about revenge later.

245
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,960
Shut up.

246
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,550
Until Sima Jiao is dead, we have no future.

247
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,680
- Father...
- Enough!

248
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,180
Instead of wasting words, reflect on yourself.

249
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,850
Yan.

250
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,460
Something happened.

251
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,250
My dear Hong Luo.

252
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,220
If you've cleaned up everything, you may leave.

253
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,050
Yan.

254
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,440
 How about this? 

255
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,490
 I'll cover the rest. 

256
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,310
 I'll give you all my savings. 

257
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,270
 That should be enough. 

258
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,290
 Then we can leave together. 

259
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,920
 If I die here one day, 

260
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,900
 can you see to my burial? 

261
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:38,530
 I don't want my body sold to corpse-refiners 

262
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,220
 and made into something weird. 

263
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,180
 Sure. 

264
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,270
 What's your name? 

265
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,810
 Call me Yan. 

266
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,030
 Once I've saved enough, 

267
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:58,160
 I'll take you and my father to Grain Rain Vale 

268
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,600
 to live a free and comfortable life. 

269
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,030
 Grain Rain Vale? 

270
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,640
 That's a place that only appears in legend. 

271
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,050
 I've never heard of anyone going there. 

272
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:14,030
 I didn't know where I came from
or who my parents were. 

273
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:18,600
 But with a true friend like you, I'm happy. 

274
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,880
 If I don't support you, who will? 

275
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,540
 It's so good to have you. 

276
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:32,620
I kept my word, didn't I?

277
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:41,180
Was it the black serpent?

278
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:44,660
They say his two underlings

279
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:49,810
forced themselves on her
when the city lord was drunk.

280
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:53,030
Hong Luo fought with all she had,

281
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:55,220
but couldn't win.

282
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,810
You're the only friend I have left.

283
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,810
Live on well.

284
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,710
Hurry up and get yourselves ready
before we leave.

285
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,360
We need to get back to Winter City.

286
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,840
- All right.
- All right. Let's go.

287
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,990
- Sure.
- I'm going to take a leak.

288
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,160
Let's go.

289
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,330
Come.

290
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,770
Once we're back in Winter City,
there'll be good liquor and meat waiting.

291
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,510
Yi, that dancer from last night
wasn't as good after all.

292
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:22,290
Yeah, if she hadn't fought back,
we could've let her live.

293
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,840
I thought some tough guy ambushed us.

294
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,880
Turns out it's just a brat.

295
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,980
Why attack us?

296
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:44,810
Because you killed someone you shouldn't have.

297
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,840
That dancer is your woman, eh?

298
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,160
You're here to avenge her?

299
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,920
She was the only peace I had.

300
00:23:54,920 --> 00:24:00,510
You took her life. Now pay with yours!

301
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,140
You're way over your head.

302
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,460
Ji!

303
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,120
How does it feel losing family?

304
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,090
I'll kill you!

305
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,460
I'll have nightmares again.

306
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,460
My Lord.

307
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,270
We're not in a rush.

308
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:27,400
I've had the men head back
to Winter City first.

309
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,470
Please drink some water and rest.

310
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:32,510
Next time I drink again, stop me.

311
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,570
Don't just enjoy yourself.

312
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,750
Yes.

313
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:39,220
I was too happy last night.

314
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,420
I smell blood.

315
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,290
Who dares ambush my men?

316
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,650
Darn it.

317
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,250
Playing tricks with me?

318
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,550
This black serpent has a dog's nose.

319
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:25,620
I've run so far, and he still smells blood.

320
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,810
Ting Yan?

321
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,980
It's you.

322
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,550
Let go of me.

323
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,990
Let go.

324
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:53,790
- Grandmaster.
- Let go.

325
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:57,570
Grandmaster, look who I brought here.

326
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,250
 Sima Jiao? 

327
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:33,100
 ♫ In the world of madness,
love burdened with greed ♫ 

328
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:40,100
 ♫ Branded with scars too raw to hide ♫

00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:47,440
 ♫ Helpless to resist,

330
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,010

 ♫ The tale of fate keeps winding on ♫ 

332

 ♫ I'm unafraid though memories are gone ♫ 

333
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:13,940

all lifetimes share one gaze ♫ 

334
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:20,500
 ♫ I believe in each life
we'll fall in love again ♫ 

335
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,620
 ♫ Through every trial we've endured ♫ 

336
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,100
 ♫ No matter who has sought the cure ♫ 

337
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:33,360
 ♫ Love is the thread that mends the scar ♫ 

338
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,460
 What's going on with him? 

339
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,050
 Aren't we supposed to be enemies? 

340
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,700
 It feels... 

341
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:54,570
 What do I feel drowsy
at such a critical moment? 

342
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,940
 What's happening? 

343
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,330
 It's the perfect chance to strike. 

344
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,660
 Oh no! 

345
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:03,460
 Sima Jiao will grind me to dust. 

346
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,160
Who have you been with all these years?

347
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,920
An old man named Shi Qian Lv.

348
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,530
I call him Father.

349
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,120
Shi Qian Lv?

350
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,230
You call him Father?

351
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,840
What has he done to you?

352
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,140
He cleanses my marrow and teaches me to kill.

353
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,510
Why didn't you come back to me?

354
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:59,440
We're archenemies.

355
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,620
Why would I deliver myself to death?

356
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:17,710
 This fellow has a spell
to make someone speak the truth? 

357
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,600
You forgot everything.

358
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,030
This must be Shi Qian Lv's doing.

359
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,550
Tell me where he is.

360
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:26,160
I won't betray him.

361
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,850
Listen well.

362
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,570
Your name is Liao Ting Yan.

363
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,840
You're my cultivation partner.

364
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,550
You have nothing to do with that man.

365
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,840
Shi Qian Lv actually made you call him Father?

366
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,920
He think he deserves it?

367
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:44,160
He's only using you against me.

368
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,660
Do you understand?

369
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:49,290
Cultivation partner?

370
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,180
Are you sure we're not enemies?

371
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,770
Sorry.

372
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:17,010
I was ahead of myself just now.

373
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,740
I won't force answers out of you again.

374
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,220
 Why is he being so gentle with me? 

375
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,010
It's fine.

376
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,250
We'll have plenty of time in the future.

377
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:37,440
 Something feels wrong. 

378
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,070
 I need to observe. 

379
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,360
Where is she?

380
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,770
Where is she?

381
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:46,880
How dare you kill my men and hurt Grandmaster!

382
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,570
I'm going to kill you!

383
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:55,030
- Hand her over!
- Hand the murderer over!

384
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:57,200
- Hand her over!
- Hand her over!

385
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,310
Hand over the murderer!

386
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,920
- Hand her over!
- This is the Zhihun clan's internal matter.

387
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,920
Hand over the murderer.

388
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,550
Winter City was founded

389
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:06,620
by the Zhihun clan a thousand years ago.

390
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,640
 

391
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:11,750
Though the city is your territory now,

392
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,120
the victims are our clansmen,

393
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,030
and this is our family matter.

394
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:21,120
So, the murderer must be handed over to us.

395
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,710
- That's right. Hand her over.
- Hand her over.

396
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,510
Hand her over now.

397
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:30,960
Unfortunately, this matter
happens to my family affair, too.

398
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,440
Why don't we settle it
by the Demon Realm's rules?

399
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,940
The stronger has the say.

400
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:37,940
What do you think?

401
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,420
You killed someone?

402
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,250
So what?

403
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:58,160
If you hadn't ambushed us,

404
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,160
you could never have killed my men

405
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,990
with your Soulbud stage.

406
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:03,530
 She fell from Void Forge to Soulbud. 

407
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:08,620
 Was she injured at that time? 

408
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,370
Grandmaster, this wench...

409
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,250
 Isn't he defending his enemy too much? 

410
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,810
Why did you kill?

411
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,850
My best friend was killed by those two men.

412
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,740
I had to avenge her.

413
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,280
I once forced you to kill.

414
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,220
But you cried and had nightmares.

415
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,810
What has Shi Qian Lv...

416
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,400
done to you?

417
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,060
In this world,

418
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,580
how can one survive without killing?

419
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,250
I promised you.

420
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:01,720
I'd never force you to kill,

421
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,740
and you'd never need to kill again.

422
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:08,240
I won't break my word.

423
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,720
Regarding this matter,
I'll handle those outside.

424
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,290
You don't have to do anything.

425
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,450
The two men have already paid their price.

426
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:27,540
They are already dead,
and their clan is innocent.

427
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,500
But I can feel

428
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,540
your hatred still remains.

429
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,930
If you only wish to kill to vent your anger,

430
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,740
I can revive them

431
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,850
and let them die again.

432
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,250
If you can revive them,

433
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:10,970
can you also bring Hong Luo back?

434
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,810
If you wish,

435
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,810
yes.

436
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:29,070
But your friend has lost her body.

437
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:31,440
I could only use Soul Transfer Spell

438
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,470
to let her be reborn.

439
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,580
Reborn?

440
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,150
That's not resurrection.

441
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,990
That's reincarnation.

442
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,360
Not quite.

443
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,920
Through the Soul Transfer Spell,

444
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,630
you get to see her quickly,

445
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:47,840
and after she's reborn,

446
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,550
she retains her past memories and feelings.

447
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:54,700
Her death will be like a dream.

448
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,890
That's great. I can see Hong Luo again.

449
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:15,930
Is Hong Luo truly this important to you?

450
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,970
She was my best friend in the Demon Realm.

451
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,330
The only one who treated me sincerely.

452
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,700
Thank you.

453
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:41,250
I once treated you sincerely, too.

454
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,970
It doesn't matter if you don't remember.

455
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,810
As long as you're here.

456
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:13,150
My Lord, why is Grandmaster
siding with some stranger?

457
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,320
What stranger?

458
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,440
She's no stranger.

459
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,630
She's my friend

460
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,550
and the Grandmistress.

461
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,290
Grandmistress?

462
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,940
 Greetings, Grandmaster. 

463
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:44,580
Please hand over the murderer for judgment.

464
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,070
And what about the woman

465
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:50,140
killed by the Zhihun brothers?

466
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,150
Grandmaster has shown you mercy

467
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,630
by not holding you accountable.

468
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,020
Now leave.

469
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,190
Bring Shi Qian Lv to me.

470
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,810
Shi Qian Lv?

471
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:14,880
What did he do again?

472
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,360
Capture him alive.

473
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,110
Don't let him die so easily.

474
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,450
Yes, Grandmaster.

475
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,540
Grandmaster.

476
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,370
Stop staring. Go.

477
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,360
Why are you following me?

478
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,400
Grandmaster, did Ting Yan
accidentally hurt you?

479
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,760
Your hand...

480
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,720
Let me call Bai Zhu to tend your wound.

481
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,020
No need.

482
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,960
It's useless.

483
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,800
Grandmaster, since you fused
the two Spirit Fires,

484
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,630
your power has grown,
but the backlash is worse.

485
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:11,280
Wounds won't heal easily.

486
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,890
Enough nonsense.

487
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,070
I'm going to perform the Soul Transfer Spell.

488
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,400
Guard me.

489
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,880
Grandmaster, it'll exhaust you.

490
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,840
You just took your heart-protecting bone
not long ago

491
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,880
to forge a defensive anklet for Ting Yan.

492
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,450
I know what I'm doing.

493
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,410
All right.

494
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,500
I'll guard you.

495
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:54,190
Sima Jiao defends Yan so much

496
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:58,670
that he even lets others
call her Grandmistress.

497
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:00,030
Did you see clearly?

498
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:02,970
Yes, I did. It's Yan.

499
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,740
Sima Jiao loves Liao Ting Yan deeply.

500
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,880
How could he have found

501
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,360
a new love so quickly?

502
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:25,890
I suspect Yan is actually Liao Ting Yan.

503
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,190
That's great.

504
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,190
But...

505
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:33,740
Winter City is now under Sima Jiao's control.

506
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:36,720
We must find a way

507
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,760
to get Liao Ting Yan out of there first.

508
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,290
Only then can we use her to forge the artifact.

509
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,880
You've kept in contact with the orphan
of General Chang, haven't you?

510
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,880
Yes.

511
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,920
Now he goes by the name Feng Qi

512
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:58,440
and works as a guard
in Celestial Crane City.

513
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,410
As you instructed,

514
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:04,100
I've also assigned him some minor tasks.

515
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:09,250
He's close with Yan.

516
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,810
It's time to put him to use.

517
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,760
 ♫ Autumn winds sigh ♫ 

518
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,680
 ♫ Moon and stars dapple the sky ♫ 

519
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,720
 ♫ Brushing the loneliness of bygone days ♫ 

520
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,680
 ♫ Candlelight flickers low ♫ 

521
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,920
 ♫ Shadows sway ♫

00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,680
 ♫ Shimmering in the night ♫ 

523
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,760
 ♫ With a brush I draw ♫ 

524
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,720
 ♫ The color of light ♫ 

525
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:13,720
 ♫ To warm your frozen soul ♫ 

526
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,560
 ♫ Memories anchor here ♫ 

527
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,920
 ♫ Longing is engraved ♫ 

528
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,120
 ♫ Yet cannot be touched ♫ 

529
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,640
 ♫ Following ♫ 

530
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,040
 ♫ The veins of gravel ♫ 

531
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,760
 ♫ I turn into spirit fire ♫ 

532
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,640
 ♫ Burning away ♫ 

533
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:37,720
 ♫ All these karmic ties ♫ 

534
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,920
 ♫ To save you ♫ 

535
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,960
 ♫ To save me ♫ 

536
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,840
 ♫ To cross over all suffering,
I'll break through ♫ 

537
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,080
 ♫ The laws of heaven ♫ 

538
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,880
 ♫ The vortex of reincarnation ♫ 

539
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:54,040
 ♫ What of life and death? ♫ 

540
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,840
 ♫ To save you ♫ 

541
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,800
 ♫ To save me ♫ 

542
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:01,680
 ♫ To redeem all beings, I'll let pass ♫ 

543
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,720
 ♫ Right and wrong ♫ 

544
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,800
 ♫ Rumors and tales ♫ 

545
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:09,720
 ♫ To seize fate ♫ 

546
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:13,120
 ♫ With my own hands ♫

 ♫ For the healing of wounds ♫ 

550
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,760
 ♫ I'll stir the murky seas ♫ 

551
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,080
 ♫ And strive against the heavens ♫ 

552
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,640
 ♫ To protect the vastness ♫ 

553
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,720
 ♫ For you ♫ 

554
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,600
 ♫ For me ♫

 ♫ I'll face promises ♫ 

557
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,800
 ♫ Like a moth to a flame ♫ 

558
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:48,960
 ♫ And use my body to shine ♫ 

559
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,600
 ♫ On even more ♫
