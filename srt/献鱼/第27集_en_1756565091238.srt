1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

2
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

3
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

5
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I want to stay with you

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
for a lifetime.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Si Ma Jiu, get up.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
No.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Si Ma Jiu.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Si Ma Jiu.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Si Ma Jiu.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I only hope that we can be together

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
for a lifetime.

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yan.

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You can still see me off.

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I can go there with peace of mind.

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Si Ma Jiu will not die.

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You can't go there with peace of mind.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I can't do that to you.

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
But

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
it's okay to lie.

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's okay to live or die.

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's okay to live or die.

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Just go with the wind.

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's time to say goodbye.

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's time.

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's time.

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's time.

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yan.

50
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yan.

51
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yan.

52
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The blood will be spilled.

53
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
We made it.

54
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Si Ma Jiu is dead.

55
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Who can stop His Majesty from becoming the evil princess?

56
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I am

57
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
in the Lin Mansion again.

58
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yes.

59
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I have been waiting for you for a long time.

60
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Who are you?

61
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
We are the same person.

62
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You are my past memories.

63
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You are my past memories.

64
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You can understand it like this.

65
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I am joined with you

66
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
is the complete memory after we came to this world of cultivation.

67
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Welcome to the palace of the evil princess.

68
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yan.

69
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
This can make you happy.

70
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Is it not good?

71
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
My destiny is

72
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I am destined to live in the clouds and the night.

73
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's a fun day.

74
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Jiao Jiao.

75
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Come on.

76
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Because I value you so much.

77
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I don't want you to be hurt at all.

78
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You are the hurtest person in this world.

79
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
The most innocent person.

80
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I saw you cry.

81
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's the first time I regret it in my life.

82
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You are not only my boyfriend in the future.

83
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I am sorry.

84
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Sima Jiao.

85
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
This time

86
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I can't wait for you to come home.

87
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I remember it.

88
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I remember it all.

89
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
How can we leave here?

90
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Sima Jiao is hurt.

91
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I have to save her.

92
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Sima Jiao is hurt.

93
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You did it.

94
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I was affected by the cold air here.

95
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Forced to turn on the body instinct of the cold jade assassin.

96
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I lost consciousness.

97
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I

98
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I hurt her.

99
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I value her so much.

100
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
How can you hurt her?

101
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Now

102
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Let's figure out a way

103
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Get out of this valley and save her.

104
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
This valley is not deep.

105
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I can't see the bottom.

106
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I tried to swim out before you woke up.

107
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
But failed.

108
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Then we two together

109
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Will it work?

110
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Lord

111
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I have killed that Sima Jiao.

112
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Fengshan Blood Sleeves is also prepared.

113
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You have protected the soul of the barrier.

114
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It means that Sima Jiao is not dead.

115
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
This

116
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Even a Sima Jiao can't deal with it.

117
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
If I am here

118
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I will regroup the demon army.

119
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Go to the immortal house in person.

120
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Lord

121
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Don't waste time with her.

122
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Do it.

123
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Are you ready?

124
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I will make you feel every feeling of forcing death.

125
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It hurts very specifically.

126
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So that you remember

127
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Every sin you have committed

128
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Old heart

129
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Let me go

130
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Lord

131
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
A Yan

132
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You dare to use me to hurt her.

133
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You deserve to be my master.

134
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
An assassin who uses blood to train

135
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Shut up

136
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Fengqi

137
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Hurry up and start the blood scheme.

138
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Want to take away my things

139
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I won't let you do as you wish.

140
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Liao Qinye

141
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Remember

142
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You beg me

143
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
To live in the world of flowers

144
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
From now on

145
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You have to die for me.

146
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Stupid

147
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
What are you doing?

148
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Hurry up and stop her.

149
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Lord

150
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
What is this situation?

151
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
This cold fish

152
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's the internal pellet of the sick master.

153
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
This

154
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Isn't she now a new master?

155
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
What are you talking about?

156
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Ridiculous

157
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Who wants to be the demon master?

158
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
How is it?

159
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
How is it?

160
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
The spiritual power of the dead is greatly damaged.

161
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And lost too much blood

162
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm afraid

163
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It's impossible

164
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
How is it possible?

165
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The master is seriously injured

166
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Ayan is also missing.

167
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
What should I do?

168
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Bai Zhu

169
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You go take care of the master first.

170
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
We'll figure out the rest.

171
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yes

172
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I know that woman is unreliable.

173
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I said how can she ease the pain of the dead horse.

174
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It wasn't easing, it was suppressing.

175
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Now her body is completely stimulated.

176
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Say you want her life

177
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
She will die at any time.

178
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Ting Yan will not hurt the master.

179
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
After all, it's a demon.

180
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
How can you be sincere to her?

181
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You, she's still stupid.

182
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Use the heart-to-heart bone to make a protective weapon for others.

183
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
In the end, I made myself crazy.

184
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I can't even control the spiritual fire.

185
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
At this time

186
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Can you stop saying some useless words?

187
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Yao Qingyan's body is a cold fish assassin.

188
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
The dead horse is the owner of the spiritual fire.

189
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
They are born to each other.

190
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Still have to get together.

191
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Isn't this just you die and I live?

192
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
She is not good.

193
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Wake her up quickly.

194
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Continue to go down.

195
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
She will burn herself to death.

196
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Now the master becomes like this.

197
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
What if

198
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
What if the demon people call this?

199
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
How to do it?

200
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Maybe

201
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Maybe I have a way to do it.

202
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Brother Nian Jiu

203
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Master once set up a protective technique for me.

204
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Protect the identity of my Fengshan bloodline.

205
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Now the master is in trouble.

206
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I asked you to solve my technique.

207
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Let me use the blood to feed the master.

208
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I know it may be effective.

209
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I will do it.

210
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I will do it.

211
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I know it may be effective.

212
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
But this is the only thing I can do for the master.

213
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Be careful.

214
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Bi An

215
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I will be careful about the blood-stained tree.

216
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I will hurt you.

217
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Do not worry.

218
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
As long as we can save the Grand Master,

219
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
and protect him from the two realms,

220
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
we can't let him die in peace.

221
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
But your life is precious too.

222
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Bai Zhu is right.

223
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You didn't say that you would give your whole body to the Grand Master.

224
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's still not clear if it will work.

225
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's just one thing.

226
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
If the Grand Master knows,

227
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
he will not be willing to see you sacrifice yourself.

228
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I will not let you die.

229
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I will not let you die.

230
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I will not let you die.

231
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I will not let you die.

232
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I will not let you die.

233
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I will not let you die.

234
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I will not let you die.

235
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I will not let you die.

236
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I will not let you die.

237
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I will not let you die.

238
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I will not let you die.

239
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I will not let you die.

240
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I will not let you die.

241
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I will not let you die.

242
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Are you okay?

243
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I was able to hold on a little bit.

244
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
But if the Grand Master still can't wake up,

245
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
the situation is still very dangerous.

246
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
If you can hold on, there is hope.

247
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Bi An,

248
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
it's all thanks to you.

249
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
This is the only thing I can do.

250
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Weandra пока Allah isolates us from hypocrisy.

251
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Lest you then suffer from moral suffering.

252
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
There's no point in telling the eclipse nonsense about yourself.

253
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Goddess Fate Hollier

254
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So long that I?"

255
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Bi An is here

256
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,100
praying to gods for help.

257
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,500
The blood of Mount Feng.

258
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,580
Let's hope that Sister Yan

259
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,340
can return safely.

260
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,220
I didn't expect

261
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,460
there would be another person

262
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,100
from Mount Feng's clan

263
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,980
besides Sima Jiao.

264
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,900
Why are you following me?

265
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,740
Are you really going to make me the Demon Lord?

266
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,980
You swallowed the inner elixir of the Demon Lord.

267
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,100
You are the only one who can be our Demon Lord.

268
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,900
Besides, the ancestors of the Immortal's Mansion

269
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,220
were also injured by you.

270
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,460
Now,

271
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,500
you are our new Demon Lord.

272
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,620
Greetings, new Demon Lord.

273
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,180
The ancestors of the Immortal's Mansion were just injured

274
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,020
and they are still alive.

275
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,060
I heard that he and the ancestors of the Immortal's Mansion

276
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,060
are not related at all.

277
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,260
If they are acting,

278
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,500
what if they lie to us?

279
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,940
Demon Lord, Sima Jiao is injured.

280
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,100
Let's go to kill him

281
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,460
at this moment.

282
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,260
What if we put out the fire?

283
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,220
If you can kill Sima Jiao,

284
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,860
I'll accept you as the Demon Lord.

285
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,180
At this moment,

286
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,100
we can't let them go to find Sima Jiao.

287
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,060
There are so many of you.

288
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,180
It's too obvious.

289
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,060
While Sima Jiao is seriously injured,

290
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,180
I'll go to kill him alone.

291
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,460
Everything will be settled.

292
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:53,940
What do you think?

293
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,340
If you recall what you said,

294
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,860
73,000 delusions

295
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,620
and 80,000 words

296
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,780
were used out before us.

297
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,740
We have 5 snakes,

298
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,220
so we all have 1 thing.

299
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,420
I want to confess something

300
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,740
that needs to be made public.

301
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,140
I'm sorry

302
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,180
that this woman

303
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:15,780
hurt you.

304
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,060
In the past one year,

305
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,260
I was dragged down in front of a hotel

306
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,700
by a objective benefit.

307
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:28,700
How could it be possible that I killed Sima Jiao?

308
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,700
Sima Jiao.

309
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,700
Wake up.

310
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,700
Look at me.

311
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,700
Sima Jiao.

312
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,700
Wake up.

313
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,700
Sima Jiao.

314
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,700
Look at me.

315
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,700
A Yan.

316
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,500
Grand Master is not dead.

317
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,700
Calm down.

318
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,700
Senior Ting Yan.

319
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,700
We are waiting for you to come back

320
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,700
to help Grand Master maintain his soul.

321
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,700
Ting Yan.

322
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,700
Only you can save Grand Master now.

323
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,380
As for all his returns,

324
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:37,780
first, you must hear that

325
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,700
Works for me?

326
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,700
Personally speaking,

327
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,700
Now he is not dead.

328
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,500
But now,

329
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,100
Si Ma Jiao!

330
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,140
Si Ma Jiao!

331
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,140
No!

332
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,100
Why hasn't there been any movement for so long?

333
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,220
Senior Sister Ting Yan

334
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,860
must have fallen into the Grand Master's dream prison.

335
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,540
If we can't find the exit,

336
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,900
she will be trapped inside,

337
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,100
until she disappears.

338
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,300
I'll go and stop them.

339
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,100
You must not.

340
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,380
If the external force is interrupted at this time,

341
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,620
the Grand Master's spiritual palace will be shut down.

342
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,900
Then they will never come out again.

343
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:39,780
Ting Yan,

344
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,260
don't give up.

345
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:44,940
I will.

346
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,100
I will.

347
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:46,900
I will.

348
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,460
I will.

349
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,060
I will.

350
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:48,820
I will.

351
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,460
I will.

352
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,060
I will.

353
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,980
Ting Yan!

354
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,140
She's awake.

355
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,460
She's no more,

356
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,100
Li000!

357
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,540
I can't let you up on that одной!

358
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,260
Shi Aber!

359
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,460
I'll go save her under this color.

360
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,420
I want you to come back again.

361
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,660
If you want to push her photo back,

362
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,700
I'll wait here until you'll return.

363
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,700
Do you want to watch him die here?

364
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,700
If I stay here, there's still hope.

365
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,700
If you take him away from here,

366
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,700
I will be in a state of disarray.

367
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,700
Then how can I save him?

368
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,700
Ling Huo.

369
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,700
Ling Huo.

370
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,700
Only the Ling Huo of the Fengshan Clan can save him.

371
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,700
Ling Huo is the curse of the Fengshan Clan.

372
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,700
But it can also save the life of the Fengshan Clan.

373
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,700
If that's the case, why don't you do it?

374
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,700
He...

375
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,700
The fire is about to go out.

376
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,700
I can't take him back to the Thunder Valley.

377
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,700
Jiao'er.

378
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,700
Thunder Valley.

379
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,700
If I take him back to the Thunder Valley,

380
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,700
can I only let Ling Huo return to his home?

381
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,700
I'm not afraid of anything.

382
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,700
Master.

383
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,700
Ting Yan.

384
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,700
How is Master?

385
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,700
Where are you taking him to, Thunder Valley?

386
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,700
I'm afraid that only by bringing thunder can I bring Ling Huo back.

387
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,700
But now the Thunder Festival is not.

388
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,700
If I want to bring thunder,

389
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,700
I'm afraid I can only offend the heaven.

390
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,700
Now the two worlds are in chaos.

391
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,700
Why don't you care?

392
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,700
Sima Jiao has done everything for the heaven.

393
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,700
Why do you want to take his life?

394
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,700
You are against the heaven.

395
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,700
Why do you accept the world's people as your enemies?

396
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,700
I haven't entered the main hall.

397
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,700
Why are you so rude?

398
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,700
You are right.

399
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,700
The demon master's internal pill is in my body.

400
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,700
It seems that I, the person who is possessed,

401
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,700
entered the holy place of the late emperor.

402
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,700
It makes you feel very uncomfortable.

403
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,700
Whether it's the god or the demon,

404
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,700
they are all living beings in this world.

405
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,700
What's the difference?

406
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,700
What living beings?

407
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,700
I'm the god's master.

408
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,700
I'll call the heaven to kill you if I have the ability.

409
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,700
Otherwise,

410
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,700
I will definitely destroy your heartless heaven.

411
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,700
I can't die yet.

412
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,700
It's really effective.

413
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,700
Liao Tingye.

414
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,700
You are in the game.

415
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,700
You are a good player.

416
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,700
I'm the god's master.

417
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,700
I'll call the heaven to kill you if I have the ability.

418
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,700
Otherwise,

419
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,700
I will definitely destroy your heartless heaven.

420
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,700
I can't die yet.

421
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,700
It's really effective.

422
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,700
Tingye.

423
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,700
What's the name?

424
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,700
Look.

425
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,700
You can't die yet.

426
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,700
Now I'm back to life.

427
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,700
You are bold.

428
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,700
I'm the god's master.

429
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,700
I'll call the heaven to kill you if I have the ability.

430
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,700
Otherwise,

431
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,700
I will definitely destroy your heartless heaven.

432
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,700
I can't die yet.

433
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,700
It's really effective.

434
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,700
I'll call the heaven to kill you if I have the ability.

435
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,700
Otherwise,

436
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,700
I will definitely destroy your heartless heaven.

437
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,700
I can't die yet.

438
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,700
It's really effective.

439
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,700
I'm the god's master.

440
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,700
I'll call the heaven to kill you if I have the ability.

441
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,700
Otherwise,

442
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,700
I will definitely destroy your heartless heaven.

443
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,700
I can't die yet.

444
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,700
It's really effective.

445
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,700
I'm the god's master.

446
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,700
I'll call the heaven to kill you if I have the ability.

447
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,700
I can't die yet.

448
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,700
You are just a demon.

449
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,700
You are just a demon.

450
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,700
Are you completely cured now?

451
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,700
I saw your spirit talisman last time.

452
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,700
I found it was so bad inside.

453
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,700
If it were a normal person,

454
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,700
would it have been painful to death?

455
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,700
Am I a normal person?

456
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,700
That's fine.

457
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,700
It's all my fault.

458
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,700
I had to go to the ancient jade room.

459
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,700
I was too naive.

460
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,700
In such a chaotic world,

461
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,700
how could there be such a garden of peach blossoms?

462
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,700
It's the star king's star.

463
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,700
I almost got you killed.

464
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,700
When I clear out the dirt

465
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,700
between the two realms,

466
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,700
you will be a dead man wherever you go.

467
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,700
You burned a bucket of the two realms.

468
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,700
Have you asked boss Mo Yue for his opinion?

469
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,700
I'm the god's master.

470
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,700
I shouldn't worry about it.

471
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,700
I'm just a god's master.

472
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,700
There's no real right to talk.

473
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,700
They let me be the god's master

474
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,700
just because of the demon elixir in my body.

475
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,700
They look at me and listen to me.

476
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,700
But they actually have to see my performance.

477
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,700
The demon prison is a place where the strong are respected.

478
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,700
You are the only one in this world

479
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,700
who can make me think without fighting.

480
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,700
You are the strong one.

481
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,700
The demon prison is not easy to fool.

482
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,700
I will arrange everything for you.

483
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,700
You can be your god's master.

484
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,700
You think so much for me.

485
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,700
I can't be the god's master.

486
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,700
I think whether it's internal or external war,

487
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,700
the most suffering is the ordinary people.

488
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,700
How about we make

489
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,700
the two worlds of the two demons merge first?

490
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,700
As for those stubborn people,

491
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,700
just keep it and sort it out slowly.

492
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,700
I'll listen to you.

493
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,700
Princess, what's going on?

494
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,700
It's the grandmaster and the grandmiss.

495
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,700
Si Ma Jiao didn't die?

496
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,700
How can our god's master become their grandmiss?

497
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,700
I told you,

498
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,700
he can't kill Ling Huo at all.

499
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,700
He even colluded with Si Ma Jiao.

500
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,700
You still want to see him as the god's master?

501
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,700
I'm not going to let you go.

502
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,700
I'm not going to let you go.

503
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,700
I'm not going to let you go.

504
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,700
I'm not going to let you go.

505
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,700
Because the god's master is him.

506
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,700
War isn't a long-term solution.

507
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,700
I have discussed with the Ancestral Master.

508
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,700
I have discussed with the Ancestral Master.

509
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,700
He'll solve the problem for us

510
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,700
of the demons' lack of spiritual organs.

511
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,700
Really?

512
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,700
This is something on the big screen

513
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,700
for our devils to do.

514
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,700
This is something on the big screen for our devils to do.

515
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,700
There's a rule to follow.

516
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,700
As long as the devils don't provoke

517
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,700
and then you can be like the people of the late emperor's mansion.

518
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,700
You can use your spirit to grow your cultivation.

519
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,700
From now on, you don't need to seek those evil and evil ways

520
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,700
that can be taken by people.

521
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,700
If there are people who are not good at fighting,

522
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,700
We will listen to the demon master.

523
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,700
From now on, the war between the late emperor and the demon is completely over.

524
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,700
We will never set up a barrier again.

525
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,700
We will communicate with each other and live in peace.

526
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,700
You also need to do your duty

527
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,700
and set an example for the people of the late emperor's mansion.

528
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,700
Yes.

529
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,700
Where did Bi An go?

530
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,580
Yuan Sabo

531
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,820
Si Ma Jiu

532
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,960
is really quite good at swords.

533
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:33,820
Be safe and take good care of insulting me!

534
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:39,860
Catch you later!

535
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,260
She's Fengshan Blood Trace.

536
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:47,780
We found her.

537
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,540
Bi'an, we finally find you.

538
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,460
What are you doing here?

539
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,860
We've been looking for you for long.

540
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,700
You're not Bi'an.

541
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,700
You're loyal.

542
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,700
You're dying and you still want to take revenge?

543
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,700
Bai Zhu is dead?

544
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,700
Yes.

545
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,700
After Bi'an disappeared,

546
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:33,700
Bai Zhu and I followed the clues to find Bi'an separately.

547
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,700
But just now,

548
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,700
Bai Zhu's life light was turned off and his soul was completely destroyed.

549
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,700
It's all my fault.

550
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,700
I didn't go with Bai Zhu.

551
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,700
The dispute between the two realms has just calmed down.

552
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,700
Everyone is in chaos right now.

553
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:50,700
There are still many people who want to take the inner elixir of the Xianfu Zi Ming.

554
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,700
Bi'an lost her protective armor.

555
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:56,700
Her blood will soon be found by You Yan's remains.

556
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,700
According to the clues,

557
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,700
from her disappearance and Bai Zhu's death,

558
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,700
I'm afraid You Yan has already found Bi'an.

559
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,700
She only wants to take her life.

560
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,700
So,

561
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,700
Bai Zhu's death was caused by You Yan?

562
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:12,700
I've decided to dig her out and avenge Bai Zhu and Bi'an.

563
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,700
And those traitors who are in the Demon Realm.

564
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,700
They must be thinking that You Yan can come back to the earth.

565
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,700
So they don't want to help Ting Yan.

566
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,700
This stinky insect.

567
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,700
There's only a bunch of lonely souls left.

568
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,700
How can it still cause a storm?

569
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,700
Ming Li.

570
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,700
Ming Li is You Yan's Xianfu.

571
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,700
If you want to find You Yan,

572
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,700
you can start with Ming Li.

573
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,700
As for the other living things,

574
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,700
except for them,

575
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,700
it's not a matter of one move.

576
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,700
You go to Xianfu.

577
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,700
Find some immortals with magic and material.

578
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,700
It's best to know the origin of the Demon Realm.

579
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,700
Let Ting Yan choose some things she likes.

580
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,700
Stay in the Demon Realm to do her work.

581
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,700
Now that there are two realms of the Demon Realm,

582
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,700
it's safe for now.

583
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,700
And those Xianfu people who have been living outside

584
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,700
can go home now.

585
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,700
I'll take your order.

586
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,700
My Lord.

587
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:13,700
I heard that Han Yu and Sima Jiao are colluding.

588
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,700
They want the two realms of the Demon Realm to be united.

589
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,700
I'm afraid those demons

590
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,700
are afraid of Sima Jiao's threat.

591
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,700
They can only listen to her for now.

592
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,700
Fine.

593
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:37,700
Although Feng Mountain can repair my primordial spirit,

594
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,700
I'm seriously injured.

595
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,700
In a short period of time,

596
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,700
I can't take her body for me.

597
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,700
I need to take care of myself.

598
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,060
I can go back to the world

599
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,700
once my primordial spirit is repaired.

600
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,700
But now you're afraid of death.

601
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,780
into a spirit.

602
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,500
You don't have to be so short-sighted.

603
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:00,020
I've been a soldier for thousands of years.

604
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,180
I never did it for a dog.

605
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,260
I did it to open the prison of Jiuyou

606
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,260
and let the sealed Demon Lord

607
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,460
return to the world.

608
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:09,940
Then,

609
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,140
our Demon Lord will

610
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,860
bring a new life.

611
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,300
You're wise, Your Majesty.

612
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:15,940
Liao Ting Yan

613
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,900
is not a member of your clan.

614
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,220
He won't be

615
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,020
the Demon Lord for long.

616
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,940
You've Tracy too.

617
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:33,640
It's the laypeople's simultaneously

618
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,780
I'll give you a sickle.

619
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,100
It can be used to turn people between lost and finally found.

620
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,340
It can be used to give you a meal

621
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:51,020
while I'm practicing of drawn.

622
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,980
The

623
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,980
The

624
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:00,700
How?

625
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,580
You are here to help Liao Ting Yan to arrest people?

626
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,500
My father once told me

627
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:06,780
The demon master's internal energy

628
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,940
can only be inherited by the blood of the You family

629
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,020
A Yan is an outsider

630
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,260
He can also integrate the internal energy

631
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,780
Why should I tell you?

632
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,460
You can choose not to tell me

633
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,380
But in this way

634
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,220
I will take you to see Si Ma Jiao

635
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,740
Let him ask you

636
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:32,860
The state preceptor and the demon master

637
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,460
have been kind to my family

638
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,940
Feng Qi is not a person who forgets kindness and is ungrateful

639
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,900
But I will never let A Yan get in trouble

640
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,820
It's okay to tell you

641
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,220
You are right

642
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,540
Without external help

643
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,820
Liao Ting Yan can't integrate the demon energy

644
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,020
If you want to start the secret method of the Chang family

645
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,140
to catch him

646
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,900
You need to get rid of your cultivation

647
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,500
But

648
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,380
He has been bought by Si Ma Jiao

649
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,860
He is the traitor of the demon prison

650
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,460
I advise you

651
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,100
Don't worry about saving him

652
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,820
Otherwise, you just help Si Ma Jiao

653
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,780
Is it nothing?

654
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,820
If you really feelgrunting

655
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,500
Tell me

656
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:17,500
Master

657
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:23,860
You're making a dowry for yourself?

658
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,820
That's right.

659
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,100
Si Ma Jiao said that

660
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,300
to make it easier for us to meet in the future,

661
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,620
he made me a banquet city.

662
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,980
Autumn night, I'll bring mountains,

663
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,380
and cold sand and water.

664
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:38,100
I'll bring mountains to the Gu Xun Mountains.

665
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,820
It's all mine.

666
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:42,380
He gave me such a big gift.

667
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,060
I should return it to him.

668
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,660
I should return it to him.

669
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:53,060
I want to send him a proposal.

670
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,820
Women are so unloyal.

671
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,900
I think

672
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,900
that black snake is also unloyal.

673
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,100
What's wrong?

674
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:11,060
Didn't you make a general for Mu Ni Sheng?

675
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,220
He's very fond of black wine now.

676
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:16,060
Mu Ni Sheng has Qiu He in his heart.

677
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,540
He's the best for being a general.

678
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:22,340
You're smart and have many evil ideas.

679
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,180
How about being my master?

680
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,020
This way,

681
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,900
you can make a living.

682
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,980
I can try.

683
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:35,860
But I'm not trying to make him make a living.

684
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,220
I really am not.

685
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,380
Okay.

686
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,300
I'll go find Hong Luo.

687
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,100
I'll go find Hong Luo.

688
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,300
I'll go find Hong Luo.

689
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,180
Nian Jiu,

690
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,140
when you just became a human,

691
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,420
I told you

692
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,700
that feelings need to be cultivated slowly.

693
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:12,900
Yes.

694
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:21,100
When your feelings are enough,

695
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,340
when you should make a final decision,

696
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,740
You should have strength

697
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:26,220
and not let your ego drop.

698
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,820
Keep fighting.

699
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:46,700
I heard that this can seal the waste and nourish the broken.

700
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:53,700
I think maybe it can help you to go back in time.

701
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,700
I don't like this kind of things.

702
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,700
Hongluo, I know you are going to refuse me again.

703
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,700
I don't want to see you again.

704
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,700
I don't want to see you again.

705
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,700
Hongluo, I know you are going to refuse me again.

706
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,700
But this is my heart.

707
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:24,700
You gave me a name and moved my heart.

708
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,700
I have a memory of you in my heart.

709
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:33,700
But at that time, I just became a human.

710
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:39,700
I didn't notice that you are a girl who hide everything in your heart.

711
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,700
I am sorry.

712
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:47,700
You have suffered so much for so many years.

713
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,700
You have suffered so much.

714
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:58,700
So this time, I want you to live a sweet life.

715
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:05,700
Hongluo.

716
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:13,700
It seems that our past is quite unexpected.

717
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,700
It feels like a book.

718
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:34,700
I want to draw a secret.

719
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:06,700
How is it? Do you like it?

720
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:08,700
It's okay.

721
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:16,700
It's just okay.

722
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,700
I don't know if you like it.

723
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,700
I just want to know.

724
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:26,700
I just want to know.

725
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:28,700
I just want to know.

726
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,700
I just want to know.

727
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:31,700
It's okay.

728
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,700
Is there anything special in this city?

729
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:43,700
Every item here, every view, you have seen it.

730
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:51,700
This is all the memories of us after we were born.

731
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,700
I just found it when you said that.

732
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:00,700
Compared to this city,

733
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:08,700
I have a great thing to discuss with you.

734
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,700
Do you remember what I said before?

735
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:16,700
There are school activities between the deities.

736
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:18,700
What do you think?

737
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:20,700
Trouble.

738
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:22,700
It's easy to cause trouble.

739
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:23,700
It's easy to cause trouble.

740
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,700
Then why don't we have a happy event first?

741
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:28,700
To liven up the atmosphere.

742
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:30,700
