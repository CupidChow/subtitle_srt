00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,600
 ♫ Heavens strike with thunderous wrath ♫ 

2
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,320
 ♫ Mountains and rivers shatter before my eyes ♫ 

3
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,680
 ♫ Endless splendor
cultivated through lifetimes ♫ 

4
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,440
 ♫ Turns to dust between my fingers
in an instant ♫ 

5
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,120
 ♫ When the line
between good and evil is clear ♫ 

6
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,240
 ♫ Countless souls drift
into the boundless wilds ♫ 

7
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,680
 ♫ Carrying the spirit fire forward ♫ 

8
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,480
 ♫ I defy fate ♫ 

9
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,000
 ♫ Just to remain by your side ♫ 

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,880
 ♫ Falling into love's abyss ♫ 

11
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,680
 ♫ Like heavy rain pouring down ♫ 

12
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,560
 ♫ Drunk on romance ♫ 

13
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,280
 ♫ In a blink, love and hate
vanish into illusion ♫ 

14
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,280
 ♫ Falling into endless love ♫ 

15
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,440
 ♫ Stirring waves upending a lifetime ♫ 

16
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,640
 ♫ Even if this life leads to ruin ♫ 

17
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,920
 ♫ I still choose to be entangled with you ♫ 

18
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,025
 ♫ Through all lifetimes ♫ 

19
00:01:30,025 --> 00:01:36,480
   

20
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,463
   

21
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,760
 ♫ Snow not gone, flame not out ♫ 

22
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,040
 ♫ Prism of three lifetimes ♫ 

23
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,440
 ♫ You, untouched by moon's regrets ♫ 

24
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,720
 ♫ No one reaches, no one hears ♫ 

25
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,600
 ♫ Thousands of stars in your eyes ♫ 

26
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,840
 ♫ Fall like fireworks ♫ 

27
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,760
 ♫ No fate's tangle, no parting swans ♫ 

28
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,560
 ♫ Memories fade ♫ 

29
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,880
 ♫ We wander the mortal world in search ♫ 

30
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,160
 ♫ Yet forget the reason why ♫ 

31
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,640
 ♫ Cycle back to raging flames ♫ 

32
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,160
 ♫ Even if my very soul were to vanish ♫ 

33
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,000
 ♫ Be it destiny or doom,
I light up the endless night ♫ 

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,120
 ♫ To chase the darkness away from your dreams ♫ 

35
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,520
 ♫ Even if heaven and earth turned to ash ♫ 

36
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,840
 ♫ I would never regret the day I met you ♫ 

37
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,200
Cold...

38
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,000
So cold...

39
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,980
Cold... So cold...

40
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,790
 It isn't cold today. 

41
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,070
 Why is she so cold? 

42
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,350
 How could there be such
strong cold energy inside her? 

43
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,880
- So cold...
 - Where is this cold energy coming from? 

44
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,220
Let me hold that for you.

45
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,350
It's fine.

46
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,270
This flower looks nice, too.

47
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,200
Lord Hei.

48
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,730
I already made it clear to you
last time, didn't I?

49
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,660
Yes, you did.

50
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,050
You said forcing a melon off the vine
never tastes sweet.

51
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,790
So, what are your intentions now?

52
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,450
What are you trying to do?

53
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:05,100
These are melons I grabbed from
the Celestial Palace disciples' herb garden.

54
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,330
They're very sweet.

55
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,670
Try some.

56
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,020
- It is sweet.
- Right?

57
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:19,580
But I don't care.
What are you going to do about it?

58
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,540
Wait. Where are you sending this?

59
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,420
To the Grandmistress's room.

60
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,580
She said the flowers and plants
from Grain Rain Vale look different

61
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,460
from those outside and very beautiful,

62
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,830
so I was assigned to deliver them.

63
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,390
You intend to just pick them
and send them as is?

64
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,810
I was careless for a moment.

65
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,860
How could we send them
without preparing them first?

66
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,240
Have you forgotten our rules
for hosting guests?

67
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,170
Who's there?

68
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,810
Watch your step.

69
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,200
Oh, you're among the Grandmistress's friends.

70
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:57,220
What did you mean by preparing them?

71
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,460
These flowers and plants need to be tidied up

72
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,730
before they can be presented
as a gift to the Grandmistress.

73
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,560
That's the proper etiquette.

74
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,340
Who made these silly rules?

75
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,730
I'm not sure, but it's always been that way.

76
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,610
What I mean is

77
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,980
I think the flowers this disciple picked
are beautiful as they are.

78
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,930
I believe the Grandmistress

79
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:20,170
would be pleased with them no matter what.

80
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:24,250
Yes, I'm sure Ting Yan isn't that fussy.

81
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,730
She might not be particular,

82
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,360
but we should still show our sincerity.

83
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,810
The rules of the Celestial Palace
are so strict.

84
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,250
As someone from the Demon Realm,
I just don't get it.

85
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,290
They look exactly the same as before to me.

86
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,540
Isn't this just unnecessary?

87
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,860
Never mind.

88
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,340
We won't bother you two any longer.

89
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,810
Excuse us.

90
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,150
Let's go.

91
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,420
Did you sleep well?

92
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,390
No, I feel so cold.

93
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,070
Did anything unusual happen

94
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:32,050
after I left yesterday?

95
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,640
Yesterday?

96
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,020
Nothing.

97
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,590
I just suddenly felt very cold.

98
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:44,930
Feng Qi said some strange things to me.

99
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:48,710
Something about me having been here before.

100
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,830
I'm going to find him.

101
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,950
What's wrong?

102
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,800
You don't look well.

103
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,830
Don't tell me you're going to
pick a fight with him?

104
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,730
Your cold energy has suddenly grown stronger.

105
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,050
I suspect this isn't a coincidence.

106
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,370
There's something strange going on.

107
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:15,680
I think Feng Qi is hiding something from us.

108
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,950
I'll use a Truth Spell to find out.

109
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,130
Don't do it.

110
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,470
You have issues with Feng Qi already.

111
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,880
I don't want you two to fight again.

112
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:32,050
If there's something to ask, I'll go.

113
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,220
By yourself?

114
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,710
It'll be fine.

115
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,030
Don't worry.

116
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,930
Grandmaster.

117
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,320
Nian Jiu.

118
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,050
Have you noticed anything strange here

119
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,240
these past few days?

120
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,900
Hong Luo and I saw Su Chang Qing

121
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,860
have someone tidy up
the flowers and plants for Ting Yan.

122
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,860
It seemed unnecessary,

123
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,860
and they worried Ting Yan might not be pleased

124
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,170
and blame them.

125
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,860
But Ting Yan isn't the picky type.

126
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,250
And for Su Chang Qing to be Ting Yan's senior,

127
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,640
he ought to know her better.

128
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:28,610
Check around there again, discreetly.

129
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,020
See if there's anything else unusual.

130
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,890
But didn't you already use

131
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,490
the Truth Spell on them last time

132
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,250
and find nothing wrong?

133
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,600
That's true.

134
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:42,220
Though the Truth Spell can compel someone

135
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,100
to speak the truth,

136
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,080
its effect is limited to what they know.

137
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,790
Understood.

138
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,100
These flowers look a bit odd,

139
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,310
but they're just ordinary flowers.

140
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,770
 These flowers and plants need to be tidied up 

141
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:18,720
 before they can be presented
as a gift to the Grandmistress. 

142
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,430
What secret are they trying to hide?

143
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,190
No wonder they're using spiritual power
to tend these flowers.

144
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,120
Something must be wrong
with the plants around here.

145
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,000
Has Sima Jiao grown suspicious?

146
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:51,220
Everything is proceeding smoothly
as you said, Preceptor.

147
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,720
That's good to hear.

148
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,490
Preceptor.

149
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:59,720
I trust you won't harm Yan,
so I'm following your plan.

150
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,300
Will Yan's memories return?

151
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,220
Of course.

152
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,820
This benefits both you and me.

153
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,060
Things are going well so far.

154
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,180
Mr. Feng, you need only find a chance

155
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,890
to tell Shi Yan the cost of that anklet.

156
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,770
Then she'll remove it herself.

157
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,150
I understand.

158
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,480
Someone's coming.

159
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,270
Yan!

160
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:31,980
Grandmaster.

161
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,410
Good. Everyone's here.

162
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:38,100
Ting Yan and I plan to stay a while longer

163
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,370
and open a few more spirit veins
for Grain Rain Vale as a reward.

164
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,700
Grandmaster, you're too courteous.

165
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,460
That...

166
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,250
That reward is too generous for us to accept.

167
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,220
Not at all.

168
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,060
Back at the Celestial Palace,

169
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,010
I once allocated you a spirit vein as well.

170
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:58,730
Of course.

171
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,580
You took good care of me back then.

172
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,790
I will never forget that kindness.

173
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,390
We will always remember your favor.

174
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,490
I'm sure Dongyang Zhenren

175
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,360
remembers this well.

176
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,360
Indeed.

177
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,820
The air here is so fresh.

178
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,100
It's been a long time
since I last smelled anything like this.

179
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,580
Even the stones in Grain Rain Vale

180
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,190
seem to give off a faint fragrance.

181
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,100
Did... Did I crush the stones too hard
and break them?

182
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,640
That's impossible.

183
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:48,000
This waterfall holds the bond
you've had since childhood.

184
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,820
Over the years,

185
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,140
while you were away,
it slowly infused itself into the stones.

186
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,890
Now that you're back, it has returned as well.

187
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:01,190
I've lived here before?

188
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,340
This lake is where you grew up.

189
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,410
But I'm not a fish.

190
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:15,000
There's no way I lived in the water.

191
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,010
Did you remember something?

192
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:20,300
Remember what?

193
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,600
Yan.

194
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,940
You were once a Frost Fish.

195
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,510
That's why you have the extreme-cold nature.

196
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,490
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

197
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,880
I'm not.

198
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:44,180
Back then, You Chi feared my father's power

199
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:50,250
and plotted against him,
wiping out my entire clan.

200
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,530
Preceptor Ming Li,
seeing I still had a breath of life,

201
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:56,000
secretly cast me into this lake,

202
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,060
leaving me a chance to survive.

203
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,790
It was then

204
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,150
that you appeared.

205
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:19,580
 I wonder how things are on Ting Yan's side. 

206
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:23,460
But I have no memories of what you said.

207
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,080
But I remember it all.

208
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,730
You were once a Frost Fish,

209
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:31,550
but Demon Lord You Chi
forged you into a human form.

210
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:38,580
By chance, you saved me here.

211
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,240
You even tore off

212
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:43,840
a scale from your chest to save me.

213
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,610
How could I ever forget such a bond?

214
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,670
You say I saved you?

215
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:55,030
Do you think I'm the woman
you've been searching for?

216
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,600
It's not what I think.

217
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,310
It's that you are indeed her.

218
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:07,880
I'm sorry.

219
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,240
I'm not the one you're looking for.

220
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:14,180
It's all right.

221
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,270
Maybe you just haven't remembered yet.

222
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,980
If you stay here a few more days,

223
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,880
you'll recover your past memories soon.

224
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:27,700
You mean this place
can help me regain my memories?

225
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,030
That's right.

226
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,940
That has been my wish all along.

227
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:37,010
 So, Feng Qi intentionally brought me here 

228
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:40,190
 to help me recover my memories
when I was a Frost Fish? 

229
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,010
If you can remember Sima Jiao,

230
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:42,820
you can surely remember me.

231
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,510
That's a different matter.

232
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:51,360
The person you seek likely vanished long ago,

233
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,430
their soul scattered to the winds.

234
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,760
That's why I am what I am now.

235
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,840
Those memories won't be mine.

236
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,720
Do you understand

237
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,150
what I mean?

238
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,730
Yan.

239
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:20,880
Yan!

240
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:35,220
Grandmaster, there's definitely something odd
with the flowers and plants here.

241
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,550
Look.

242
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,700
It's like they've been
corrupted by demonic energy.

243
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,390
Then what about the cold energy inside me?

244
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,530
Feng Qi told me I'm a Frost Fish raised here.

245
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:52,130
Could the recent surge in my cold energy

246
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:54,180
be due to this place's influence?

247
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,820
Did he really say
you were raised here as a Frost Fish?

248
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,120
Yes.

249
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,860
Cold energy and demonic energy.

250
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,860
Grain Rain Vale is supposed to be

251
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,530
a blessed sanctuary within the Demon Realm.

252
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:10,890
How could it be more complicated
than the outside world?

253
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:14,530
Dongyang Zhenren and the disciples
from the Immortal Realm all live here.

254
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:17,390
Surely they wouldn't settle
in a place filled with strife.

255
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,490
Unless my master and those here lied to us.

256
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:21,610
But Grandmaster,

257
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,130
you already used the Truth Spell on them.

258
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:27,700
As I've said, the Truth Spell
can compel someone to speak the truth,

259
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,730
but it isn't flawless.

260
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:30,860
What do you mean?

261
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:34,130
Just now, I questioned them
about the Celestial Palace.

262
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,730
There were discrepancies in the details

263
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:38,150
compared to what
the real Dongyang Zhenren would say.

264
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,790
Do you remember

265
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:45,220
Shi Qian Du's death?

266
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,910
The Soul Cleanse?

267
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,300
Could Shi Qian Lv be behind all this?

268
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,960
Did he cleanse the souls of the people here?

269
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:02,120
The cold energy Ting Yan suddenly emitted
mostly came from the food at the banquet.

270
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,580
That was when I started suspecting

271
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,710
something strange about this place.

272
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:12,780
 This duck meat is delicious
and seems very nourishing. 

273
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,520
 It feels like it's restoring my energy. 

274
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,540
Ever since I entered Grain Rain Vale,

275
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,690
my body has grown increasingly uncomfortable.

276
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:25,430
It must be the cold energy
from Ting Yan's anklet affecting me.

277
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,190
To manipulate
your cold constitution so strongly,

278
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:38,520
while simultaneously
spreading demonic corruption

279
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,840
to all the plants and creatures here,

280
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:49,230
there's only one place
in the entire Demon Realm capable of that.

281
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:12,210
What is all of this?

282
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,670
Where are we?

283
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,260
Who are you?

284
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,860
Alas, we've been found out.

285
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,890
Who are you?

286
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,230
Shi Qian Lv's Soul Cleanse is truly formidable.

287
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:26,670
You've even forgotten your own master.

288
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,080
 Mr. Ghost. 

289
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:43,340
We never came to Grain Rain Vale.

290
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,230
This is actually the Demon Realm's core,

291
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:47,950
White Bone Abyss.

292
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,170
So, everything here has been a lie.

293
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,820
Who could have plotted so meticulously

294
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,450
to trick us here?

295
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,740
No one else but the Demon Lord and Ming Li

296
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:06,670
could wield such power in White Bone Abyss.

297
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:13,820
Preceptor, Sima Jiao
is not to be underestimated.

298
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:18,130
This Grain Rain Vale is a flawless illusion

299
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:21,890
we created together
using Shi Qian Lv's Soul Cleanse.

300
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:25,820
- Even so, he has seen through it now.
- No matter.

301
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,860
Since we've lured Sima Jiao and Liao Ting Yan

302
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:31,820
into White Bone Abyss,
everything is under our control.

303
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,890
Precisely.

304
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:35,580
That Frost Fish
still wears the defensive anklet

305
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,780
made from his heart-protecting bone.

306
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,970
They certainly wouldn't expect
your two-birds-one-stone strategy.

307
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,970
The Frost Fish's defensive anklet

308
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:46,100
channels cold energy
that backlashes onto Sima Jiao,

309
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,710
severely restricting his cultivation.

310
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:55,500
If the Frost Fish removes the anklet
to save Sima Jiao,

311
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,930
it will give us an opening to capture her.

312
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:04,650
Right now, the priority is to bring
Liao Ting Yan here to refine the frost stone.

313
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:09,040
Then we can kill Sima Jiao
and take his blood in one strike.

314
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,840
- What's wrong?
- Grandmaster, are you all right?

315
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,190
I'm fine.

316
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:27,610
Ming Li's people will be here soon.

317
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,130
You should leave with Nian Jiu first.

318
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,890
The Demon Realm will unleash
their full strength against you.

319
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:34,100
You can't take on all of them alone.

320
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,230
I'll go get Hong Luo.
Nian Jiu will go with you.

321
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:41,450
I'm stronger than before.

322
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,690
Don't underestimate me.

323
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:45,300
Besides, I still have the anklet you gave me.

324
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,800
I'll be fine.

325
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,560
All right.

326
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,600
Wait for me.

327
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:10,300
Sima Jiao, how have you
been recovering at Grain Rain Vale?

328
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,040
Cut the chatter.

329
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,060
Hong Luo!

330
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,470
Hong Luo!

331
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,670
Hong Luo!

332
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,560
Hong Luo!

333
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,340
Grandmaster.

334
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,780
Ting Yan's cold energy can,

335
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,860
through the defensive anklet
made from your heart-protecting bone,

336
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,580
retaliate against your cultivation

337
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,390
and limit your powers.

338
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,540
Hong Luo!

339
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,450
- Hong Luo!
- Yan!

340
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:24,930
Yan.

341
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:27,540
Something's wrong here. Are you all right?

342
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:30,130
Was all of this part of your plan?

343
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:33,340
What do you mean? I'm just worried about you.

344
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,450
Did you collude
with the Demon Realm and Shi Qian Lv

345
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,750
to lure me into this Grain Rain Vale illusion?

346
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,370
What's your goal?

347
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,060
I have no intention to harm you.

348
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,520
I only want to awaken the memories between us.

349
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:50,410
I told you, I'm not your Frost Fish.

350
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,930
Yan, I can explain!

351
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:53,370
This concerns Sima Jiao's safety.

352
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:54,950
Don't you want to know?

353
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,280
What's wrong with Sima Jiao?

354
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,060
Perhaps you noticed.

355
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:04,060
Sima Jiao's cultivation weakening
and his body acting strangely

356
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,300
since arriving here.

357
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,600
It's related to the artifact on your foot.

358
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,450
Impossible.

359
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,820
He forged this defensive artifact for me.

360
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,580
It can block all harm.

361
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:21,890
You should know this artifact is made
from his heart-protecting bone.

362
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:24,450
It shields you from damage,
which doesn't hurt him,

363
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:28,650
but your cold energy clashes with his.

364
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,820
The White Bone Abyss triggers your cold energy.

365
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,500
It makes you uncomfortable,

366
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,970
but since you're a Frost Fish,

367
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,860
it won't actually harm you.

368
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,690
Yet your accumulating cold energy

369
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:43,150
backlashes onto his body through your anklet.

370
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:48,540
 What's wrong? 

371
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,560
 Grandmaster, are you all right? 

372
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,990
 I'm fine. 

373
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:02,060
Yan, you'd risk yourself for him?

374
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,360
Who's there?

375
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,130
Grandmaster. Nian Jiu.

376
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:12,170
Hong Luo, what are you doing here?

377
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,300
Where's Ting Yan?

378
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,470
Wasn't she with you?

379
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,560
This isn't good.

380
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:26,340
This is bad.

381
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,650
She removed the defensive anklet.

382
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:31,470
Nian Jiu, get Hong Luo out of here first.

383
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,020
Hong Luo, I'll get you out
and return to help him.

384
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,280
All right.

385
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,080
Yan.

386
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,280
Father.

387
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,120
Your leg...

388
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:00,740
So, even your injury was a lie.

389
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:03,670
You manipulated my guilt

390
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,340
to make me your tool for revenge.

391
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,170
You've disappointed me.

392
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:11,210
Qian Du was right.

393
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,060
Raising you was a waste of time.

394
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:16,260
If I meant anything to you as your daughter,

395
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,390
you wouldn't have done this to me.

396
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,260
You were behind
the Grain Rain Vale illusion too,

397
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,470
weren't you?

398
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:31,120
Yan, I devoted my life's learning to you.

399
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:35,210
But it still couldn't match Sima Jiao's skill

400
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:38,040
in swaying hearts.

401
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:42,600
So be it.

402
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,640
Feng Qi.

403
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:57,130
Yan, please believe me.

404
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:59,260
I would never harm you.

405
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:02,080
Are you really going to choose his side?

406
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:10,340
I don't care about your past.

407
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,610
I just want her memories restored.

408
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:14,060
Do not hurt her.

409
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,170
Leave her to me.

410
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:18,640
Preceptor and I still need her

411
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,320
to fight Sima Jiao.

412
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:27,280
 Rest assured, Mr. Feng. 

413
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:36,450
 The best way to recover her memories 

414
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:39,740
 is to send her to the Guiyuan Chamber
deep within White Bone Abyss. 

415
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,930
 That's where the cold energy is strongest. 

416
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:44,780
 It will awaken her cold constitution. 

417
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:48,130
 When she returns, you'll have the Frost Fish 

418
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:49,610
 who's recovered everything. 

419
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:51,500
 But Sima Jiao
is incredibly difficult to deal with. 

420
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,820
 He watches Yan every moment 

421
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,100
 without letting her out of his sight. 

422
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,650
 What if Sima Jiao is actually willing 

423
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,100
 to bring her here? 

424
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,890
 What do you mean? 

425
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:02,650
 Shi Yan's father told me 

426
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:04,130
 she's always dreamed of Grain Rain Vale, 

427
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:06,890
 a sanctuary revered in the Demon Realm. 

428
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,690
 Why don't we embellish it 

429
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:11,020
 and create a Grain Rain Vale illusion for her? 

430
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:14,020
 How could that be possible? 

431
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:16,450
 You don't need to worry about that. 

432
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:20,930
 Just bring your Frost Fish there. 

433
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:26,100
 Yan, I'm sorry. I lied to you. 

434
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,890
 You're not truly yourself right now. 

435
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:31,260
 When you regain your Frost Fish memories, 

436
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,600
 you'll understand why I did what I did. 

437
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,620
 

438
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,010
Is that General Chang Zhi

439
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:43,490
standing next to the Preceptor?

440
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:47,000
No, that's Feng Qi,
the orphaned son of General Chang Zhi.

441
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,520
Ming Li.

442
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:57,330
You, as Preceptor, dare to betray your lord?

443
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:02,070
I'm loyal to the former Demon Lord.
I don't consider this a betrayal.

444
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:22,590
You want to use my blood

445
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,340
to resurrect that old beast?

446
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,780
Insolence!

447
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:31,170
Subjects of the Demon Realm,
welcome the return of the former Demon Lord.

448
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:34,630
Welcome the return of the former Demon Lord.

449
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,150
What a joke.

450
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,780
You think

451
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:43,350
your words alone make it true?

452
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:48,110
Is this how the descendants
of the You family behave? Arrogant and useless?

453
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:52,070
Old fool! I'm still
the Lord of the Demon Realm!

454
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,830
How dare you disrespect me...

455
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:59,280
Not willing to surrender
your demonic body to me?

456
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,870
But as a descendant of the You family,

457
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:05,680
this is your fate.

458
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:10,550
Your demonic soul
has been in this body long enough.

459
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:13,460
Too long to matter anymore.

460
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,040
How's the progress on the Xingtian Chain?

461
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,460
My Lord.

462
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,560
Speak.

463
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,630
The frost stone is still
undergoing intensive refinement.

464
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:26,390
Soon, it will let us
kill Sima Jiao in one strike.

465
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:29,240
We can't afford any mistakes
with the Xingtian Chain.

466
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,740
Yes, I shall head to supervise now.

467
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,065
 

468
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,480
The Frost Fish assassin,
once devoted to the Demon Lord,

469
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,370
has now become rebellious because of Sima Jiao.

470
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:12,370
Sect Master Shi, thanks to your help,
we've succeeded.

471
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,480
I had asked you to rest earlier,

472
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,410
but you insisted
on guarding the Guiyuan Chamber.

473
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:27,310
Preceptor, the success of the Xingtian Chain

474
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:29,830
is crucial for our revenge plan.

475
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,610
There mustn't be a single slip-up.

476
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:14,590
Are you driven by revenge,

477
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:17,570
or are you reluctant
to see your fake daughter suffer?

478
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,350
You're overthinking.

479
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:25,040
I excel at marrow cleansing

480
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,240
and can use theG uiyuan Chamber's
cold energy here

481
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,790
to aid the froststone's refining.

482
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:34,570
In that case, I thank you for your assistance.

483
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:41,040
Preceptor, Sima Jiao is charging in.

484
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,110
He's rushing to his death.

485
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:46,480
Sect Master Shi, I'll handle Sima Jiao.

486
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,170
I leave this to you.

487
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,460
Understood.

488
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,960
 Revenge is within reach. 

489
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,170
 Don't blame me for being ruthless. 

490
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:25,520
Sima Jiao, the former Demon Lord's
blood sacrifice

491
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,000
and return are inevitable for the Demon Race.

492
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,200
You alone can't stop it.

493
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,110
You Yan's true vessel has been shattered

494
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,590
by the Sima clan's Spirit Fire.

495
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:37,390
Yet you still dream of resurrection.

496
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:39,630
Return Liao Ting Yan,

497
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:41,720
and I'll grant you an honorable death.

498
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,830
You're too late.

499
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:47,260
By now, she's probably
been refined into frost stone.

500
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:51,330
I'll use it to kill you soon.

501
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,680
It will be complete any moment now!

502
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,020
I won't let that happen!

503
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,930
Ting Yan!

504
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:00,920
Sect Master Shi!

505
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,220
How much longer
until the Xingtian Chain is ready?

506
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,960
It's been a while, Grandmaster.

507
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,150
I've let you live too long.

508
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:36,850
I'm glad I raised a good daughter.

509
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,000
Given your current relationship,

510
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,750
shouldn't you be addressing me as Father?

511
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,800
The frost stone isn't fully refined yet.

512
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,800
Coming here armed with that pathetic relic,

513
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,660
you're asking for your own demise!

514
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,860
Grandmaster, I'll take care of Ming Li!

515

to the Xingtian Chain.

Do you really think
your petty tricks can kill me?

533
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:36,100
Do you think I'm ignorant enough
to survive over a thousand years

534
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,450
without realizing this?

535
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:45,000
Sima Jiao, I know you're stalling here

536
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,440
to buy time for Liao Ting Yan's escape.

537
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,360
But even if she escapes the Guiyuan Chamber,

538
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,710
can she escape her fate?

539
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:58,440
Her destiny ceased to be yours to control

540
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,070
the moment she met me.

541
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:02,330
Ceased to be ours to control?

542
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,820
If it's not ours to decide,

543
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,190
then is it yours?

544
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,820
Her destiny

545
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,930
is hers alone to decide.

546
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,630
Nian Jiu!

547
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:33,050
Nian Jiu!

548
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,670
Wake up!

549
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,180
Nian Jiu!

550
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:43,040
Sima Jiao, don't you see?

551
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:48,040
Anyone close to you
can't control their own fate.

552
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:51,590
Your birth and the existence
of the Fengshan Clan

553
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:53,480
are all but a joke.

554
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,670
You're only fit to be locked away,

555
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:57,550
turned into blood slaves and puppets!

556
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:01,970
You're unworthy
to rule the Immortal-Demon world!

557
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:33,360
The extreme cold energy has awakened

558
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:37,000
her Frost Fish instincts.

559
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,010
Her body betrays her will.

560
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:46,110
Sima Jiao, do you think

561
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:52,780
her nature can overcome her feelings for you?

562
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,930
Ting Yan.

563

 ♫ In the world of madness,
love burdened with greed ♫

571
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,590
Look! The blood core
is merging into the blood pool!

572
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:19,040
It's the blood of Fengshan!

573
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,800
It's the blood of Fengshan!

574
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,480
Congratulations, Demon Lord!

575
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:27,230
The Xingtian Chain is indeed working wonders.

576
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:31,930
Once the blood pool fills,
the blood sacrifice can begin.
