1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The wind and the moon are the same.

2
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
But between us, love can be exchanged.

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Who loves me?

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I can't heat up the next lifetime.

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Even if this lifetime is endless,

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I still want to be with you.

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We will never return to the same place.

8
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I will never forget you.

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I still want to be with you.

10
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Who went to rob again?

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Here.

12
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Eat this.

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I feel warm.

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
How much more do you have?

17
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Here and here.

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I handled it too lightly.

19
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
If I knew those things would hurt you,

20
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I should have let them die a little worse.

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Okay, don't be angry.

22
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The important thing is that we have been free.

23
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Did what happened today make you scared?

25
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
No.

26
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You're not scared after what happened?

27
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Then should I say I'm scared?

28
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Look.

29
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Your wound healed pretty well.

30
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But I still have a lot of internal injuries.

31
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The snow hasn't stopped, the night hasn't stopped.

32
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Actually, there is another way

33
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
that can make your wound heal faster.

34
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Just like how you cured me.

35
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I can't hear, but I can't hear.

36
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
What you said is so good.

37
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The firework turns into fireworks.

38
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Not only these.

39
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I don't want to let fate separate us.

40
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The past is past, the present is past.

41
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The memories are scattered.

42
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
The red city is like a long-lasting lock.

43
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I've forgotten the cause and effect of love.

44
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The reincarnation is like a flame.

45
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Even if it's a dream, it's still a dream.

46
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Don't ask the firework's sword.

47
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Light up the night.

48
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I want to light up your dream.

49
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The firework burns to the ground.

50
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I miss you.

51
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Love is too crazy.

52
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Open your heart.

53
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You know me.

54
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What are you doing?

55
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm going to be burned to death.

56
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The snow hasn't stopped, the night hasn't stopped.

57
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The firework turns into fireworks.

58
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
This is the way I've been suffering day and night.

59
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But you don't regret the wind and rain.

60
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The wind and rain.

61
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
No one is listening.

62
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
No one is listening.

63
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The wind and rain.

64
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
No one is listening.

65
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
There are thousands of stars in your eyes.

66
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
They turn into fireworks.

67
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Don't be afraid.

68
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm here.

69
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
No one will hurt you in the future.

70
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The pain like this will no longer exist.

71
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
If you're a man in pain,

72
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
you can be at ease with me.

73
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Don't be serious.

74
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Light up the night.

75
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I want to light up your dream.

76
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The firework burns to the ground.

77
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I miss you.

78
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I won't meet you again.

79
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
If you get hurt like this again,

80
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'll kill you.

81
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I can't bear to leave you.

82
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Tell me your truth.

83
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You love me first.

84
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Don't be serious.

85
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Light up the night.

86
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I want to light up your dream.

87
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The firework burns to the ground.

88
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I miss you.

89
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I won't meet you again.

90
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
The wind and rain.

91
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
The wind and rain.

92
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The rain and rain.

93
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The wind and rain.

94
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The wind and rain.

95
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Light up the night.

96
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The wind and rain.

97
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The wind and rain.

98
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
The wind and rain.

99
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The wind and rain.

100
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The wind and rain.

101
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The wind and rain.

102
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The wind and rain.

103
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The wind and rain.

104
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The wind and rain.

105
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The wind and rain.

106
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The wind and rain.

107
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The wind and rain.

108
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The wind and rain.

109
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The wind and rain.

110
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The wind and rain.

111
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The wind and rain.

112
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The wind and rain.

113
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
The wind and rain.

114
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The wind and rain.

115
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The wind and rain.

116
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The wind and rain.

117
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
The wind and rain.

118
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Our love has begun.

119
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Amen.

120
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,600
You finally let me out.

121
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,080
Canlan,

122
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,280
I've already

123
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,760
joined hands with the leader

124
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,040
to take Sima's life.

125
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,120
Really?

126
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,400
It sounds like

127
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,200
the Shi family is very respected

128
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,280
and suspicious of you.

129
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,880
You must be careful.

130
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,840
How about this?

131
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,800
I can search the Shi family's hideout secretly

132
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,160
to avoid being caught by others

133
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,200
and being manipulated by them.

134
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,360
No need.

135
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,680
Just stay here

136
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,960
and keep the Yinzhi Palace safe.

137
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,760
I'm here for you.

138
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,680
But...

139
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,280
Enough.

140
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,480
Don't worry about it.

141
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,920
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

142
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,800
Let's talk about something happy,

143
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,760
okay?

144
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,280
Okay.

145
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,560
Leader Yan,

146
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,200
Leader Yan,

147
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,400
after a recent investigation,

148
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,720
we haven't found out that Princess Ye

149
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,120
colluded with Sima Jiao.

150
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,640
Keep watching.

151
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,840
This person

152
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,800
can't be trusted.

153
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,080
Yes.

154
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,040
Besides,

155
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,080
Princess Ye's sister Ye Cang Lan

156
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,360
seems to be looking for a way to counter us.

157
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,520
Ye Cang Lan

158
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,640
is always willful

159
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,040
and may not be good for our plan.

160
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,560
Don't move her.

161
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,600
I want to hold

162
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,920
the knife in my hand

163
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:04,900
so that she'll be

164
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,720
worried about us this way.

165
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,760
What happened to you?

166
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,840
Have you still been blessed?

167
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,960
Before I knew it,

168
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,240
Yin Hi was a criminal

169
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,480
Shoulder.

170
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,640
Shoulder.

171
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,440
Just kidding.

172
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,680
Where is this?

173
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,760
Feng Hua City.

174
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,640
You are the city leader of Zhe City now.

175
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,000
You are the Prime Minister.

176
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,040
The Shi Family?

177
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,760
We are now inside the enemy's territory?

178
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,480
Feng Hua City is outside the Palace of Immortals.

179
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,280
Although Shi Yuxiang is from the Shi Clan,

180
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,080
he doesn't take it seriously.

181
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,680
But he seems to be

182
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,000
living a happy life.

183
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,720
Shi Yuxiang has always been arrogant and domineering.

184
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,320
He built a Feng Hua City.

185
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,760
People outside

186
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,880
call Feng Hua City

187
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,800
the Wind Moon City.

188
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,880
You found me such an amazing character.

189
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,440
It's really hard for me.

190
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,000
Jiaojiao is so capable.

191
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,200
How can I fail you?

192
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,440
How dare you.

193
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,760
City Leader, are you up?

194
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,240
Listen...

195
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,080
City Leader,

196
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,320
someone is blocking me from coming in.

197
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,840
It's not appropriate to shout.

198
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,480
If City Leader really wants to favor you,

199
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,760
he will call you in.

200
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,920
I'm your friend.

201
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:01,720
You...

202
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:05,920
City Leader,

203
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,760
he is your friend.

204
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,560
But I've never seen him before.

205
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,040
He is my friend.

206
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,120
City Leader,

207
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,520
he is impolite and unruly.

208
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,520
He is not even as good as the one behind you.

209
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,640
How can you explain to him?

210
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,920
I mean,

211
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,840
he is my friend.

212
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,520
In private,

213
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,920
he is not as good as me.

214
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,440
You...

215
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,680
City Leader.

216
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,760
Impolite.

217
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,920
The one on the bed.

218
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,480
City Leader is awake.

219
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,760
You didn't serve him well.

220
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,960
You washed him and changed his clothes.

221
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,680
He is still lying on the bed.

222
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,600
I'll drive you back to the countryside tomorrow.

223
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,240
How dare you!

224
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,600
You should be the one

225
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,920
to teach my people a lesson.

226
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,720
City Leader.

227
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:03,800
City Leader.

228
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,920
Do you need my service?

229
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,400
No.

230
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,200
You can continue to lie down.

231
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,120
Get out now!

232
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,240
Yes.

233
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,120
Why do I feel

234
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,560
like I have met

235
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,480
the one you told me about?

236
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,120
I learnt from my teacher.

237
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,720
They had a Swordねぇ Sh needed.

238
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,920
When have I seen someone like that?

239
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,880
Five or six years ago.

240
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,200
I didn't get your divine power then.

241
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,720
Nian Jiu.

242
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,440
Ye Ru Ling is too affectionate to you.

243
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,280
If you want me to teach you how to be a person,

244
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,600
I'll find another one for you.

245
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,320
In the future, except for the Grand Master,

246
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,400
I don't want to have any more teachers.

247
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,440
Nian Jiu.

248
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,680
I heard that this Phoenix City is quite interesting.

249
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,600
How about we go there together?

250
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,600
Okay.

251
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,560
I want to take you to a place first.

252
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,560
Then you have to go there yourself.

253
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,560
I'll wait for you.

254
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,640
Is there any news of the new spirit fire?

255
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,440
No.

256
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,520
But someone will take the initiative to find it.

257
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,440
Who?

258
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,320
Shi Qian Lv.

259
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,440
Take action according to the plan.

260
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,200
Guards.

261
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,200
Your Highness.

262
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,040
I'm going out today.

263
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,240
You must keep an eye on the Young Princess.

264
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:24,720
Yes.

265
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,840
Young Princess.

266
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,840
Young Princess.

267
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,320
Guards!

268
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,560
Young Princess!

269
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,600
I'm going to kill that sweetheart.

270
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,640
Young Master!

271
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,360
Give us out.

272
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,920
We want to get rid of him!

273
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,440
Master!

274
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,040
Master!

275
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,440
They're looking for us?

276
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,200
Make way for us.

277
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,680
göraR Never hear of 것으로it.

278
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,920
Xiaowu, take a look!

279
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,360
Master!

280
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,000
Please be mercy!

281
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,080
Master!

282
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:05,800
Let it off!

283
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,040
Please be mercy!

284
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,640
Why did you bring me to the treasure house in the fish-scented box?

285
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,320
You didn't need to be angry before.

286
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,640
Why did you come here all of a sudden?

287
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,560
What's this for?

288
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,800
Defense.

289
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,920
Are these all for me?

290
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,440
Forget about the ring.

291
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,960
I really need to hang it on my nose.

292
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,640
I feel like my beautiful nose is going to fall off.

293
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,880
This is a ring.

294
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,240
It's so exaggerated.

295
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,440
It feels like it's for cows.

296
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:52,680
No.

297
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,200
I think it's okay.

298
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,360
I can't. I don't agree.

299
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,600
Are these really for me?

300
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,280
Of course.

301
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,040
But I don't like it.

302
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,040
Forget it, okay?

303
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,040
I can hear you scolding me in my heart.

304
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,760
I've been really bad recently.

305
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,680
I warn you not to annoy me.

306
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,360
But I don't want to see it.

307
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,200
What about this?

308
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,160
Do you like it?

309
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,800
I like this.

310
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,200
This is pretty.

311
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,280
It's a pity that it's not a defense treasure.

312
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,200
What's wrong with you?

313
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,000
Do you really have feelings for me?

314
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,720
The pill is not bad.

315
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,960
You can calm down after taking it.

316
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,480
I feel so good.

317
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,400
Greetings, Your Highness.

318
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,720
Greetings, Your Highness.

319
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:32,720
Your Highness.

320
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,760
Your Highness.

321
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,800
Go away.

322
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:35,880
Leave me alone.

323
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,880
Please forgive us.

324
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,720
Please forgive us.

325
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,640
Please forgive us.

326
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,240
Please forgive us.

327
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,240
There is one.

328
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,320
I won't wear it.

329
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,280
Are you kidding me?

330
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,200
Sima taught you to be childish

331
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,520
like a child.

332
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,320
Why is it suddenly raining?

333
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,960
I'm in a bad mood.

334
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,440
Even the weather is here to make trouble.

335
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,360
I'm in a bad mood.

336
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,520
Who are you?

337
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,960
How dare you destroy my Shijia Lvzhan?

338
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,720
You are here.

339
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,120
Father.

340
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,960
Another spiritual mountain has been destroyed.

341
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,320
Who did it?

342
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,640
That person has poor cultivation.

343
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,920
The disciples failed to catch up.

344
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,360
But the skill he used

345
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,360
is similar to Sima Jiao's spiritual energy.

346
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,440
Sima Jiao did it.

347
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,600
He is looking for our spiritual fire.

348
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,680
Yes.

349
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,200
I'm worried about it.

350
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,680
By the way, father.

351
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,800
There is one more thing.

352
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,800
When you asked me to check the internal hardening,

353
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,880
I found a person who should have died.

354
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:39,760
Who?

355
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,280
Yuan Shang.

356
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,600
Yuan Shang?

357
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,320
He is still alive?

358
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,480
Yes.

359
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,000
If Yuan Shang is still alive,

360
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,800
the person who failed to catch up with the vanguard

361
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,360
is someone with a different mind.

362
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,560
It's not

363
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,200
Ye Ru Ling.

364
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,480
You mean

365
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,080
you suspect Yuan Che?

366
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,440
Sima Jiao knew

367
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,600
we were going to kill Yuan Shang.

368
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,280
So he set up this trap for us

369
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,040
to take Yuan Che

370
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,640
and use him.

371
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:25,720
Father.

372
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,800
We can also use Yuan Shang

373
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,040
to make Yuan Che our spy.

374
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,000
After Sima Jiao's

375
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,200
great fire in Baifeng Mountain,

376
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,720
his spirit was greatly hurt.

377
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,640
He became the emperor of the world.

378
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,480
Yuan Che followed him so desperately.

379
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:42,880
This person

380
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,400
can't be used.

381
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,080
Let's kill him.

382
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,080
Kill him.

383
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,760
Yuan Shang is still alive.

384
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,040
Do you understand?

385
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,880
No need to kill him.

386
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,080
Sima Jiao's

387
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,600
whereabouts are uncertain.

388
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,080
I can't find his whereabouts.

389
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,120
Maybe

390
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,440
this gives me an opportunity to find him.

391
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,880
He is indeed more clumsy.

392
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,040
The

393
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,640
Master.

394
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,000
Yuan Che sent a letter.

395
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,080
Look.

396
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,680
The plan has been developed.

397
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,920
Please wait for the news.

398
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,920
The time is running out.

399
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,880
Hurgile viewpoint

400
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,000
Gu higher.

401
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,960
H públic nèu rèidè

402
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,160
The best way

403
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,840
is to tell

404
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:12,660
the Great Sun

405
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,920
about our plan.

406
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,640
No need to tell me every two words.

407
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,600
Do it as a book.

408
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,040
A book in your hand can solve many Souls' problems.

409
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,200
ulttes martial art

410
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,240
is more amazing.

411
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:25,760
Consult me.

412
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,520
I don't know.

413
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,800
According to his cultivation,

414
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,840
with your magic and assistance,

415
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,480
he should be able to get through it easily.

416
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,280
Then why does he have to

417
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,640
do so much?

418
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,080
I won't be with him.

419
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,280
Why?

420
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,480
The road to heaven is a cloud.

421
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,000
It's always a path for Si Ma.

422
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,360
I'll be with him.

423
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,000
It'll only make him more dangerous.

424
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,280
Hmm?

425
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,440
Isn't this a spell of Chwu?

426
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,760
How did it become a defense spirit flag?

427
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,320
You made it yourself?

428
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:00,000
Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

429
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,520
How many layers of defense spirit is there?

430
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:03,920
Are you done counting?

431
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,640
No.

432
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,160
I'm sure I won't need so many.

433
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,200
There will be a time

434
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,600
when I'm not by your side like last time.

435
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,840
I thought about it

436
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,360
and practiced the defense spirit flag.

437
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,200
I can protect you from danger.

438
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,360
You won't be able to do that recently.

439
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,520
You'll be able to use it soon.

440
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,240
Why?

441
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,960
Why are you talking to me like that?

442
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,200
I can't sleep if you do that.

443
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,440
Si Ma Jiao.

444
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,640
I didn't do anything wrong.

445
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,080
Why am I so panicked?

446
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,000
Jiao Jiao.

447
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,800
Jiao Jiao.

448
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,640
Jiao Jiao.

449
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,560
Jiao Jiao.

450
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,560
Jiao Jiao.

451
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,560
Jiao Jiao.

452
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,560
Jiao Jiao.

453
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,560
Jiao Jiao.

454
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,560
Jiao Jiao.

455
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,560
Jiao Jiao.

456
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,560
Jiao Jiao.

457
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,560
Jiao Jiao.

458
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,560
Jiao Jiao.

459
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,880
Jiao Jiao.

460
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,880
There's something wrong with the thunder.

461
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,800
Jiao Jiao.

462
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,560
I'm really panicked.

463
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,600
I wasn't like this when the thunder struck.

464
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,000
You'll break through the defense spirit flag soon.

465
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,880
That's why you'll be connected.

466
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,960
No wonder I've been so tired lately.

467
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,400
You sent me the defense spirit flag

468
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,440
because you were afraid I'd be struck by the thunder.

469
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,880
I won't be the first person

470
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,120
to be struck by the thunder, right?

471
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,280
I won't let you die.

472
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,280
You won't die.

473
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,880
Qin Xianxing.

474
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,080
You're the best.

475
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,680
Why don't you stop touching me?

476
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,680
I'm so tired.

477
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,680
I haven't prepared the thunder festival.

478
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,880
Don't touch me.

479
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,400
You...

480
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,400
I'll go now.

481
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,400
Thunder festival.

482
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,680
Kiss the moon.

483
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,560
No matter what,

484
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,320
the sound doesn't betray our feelings.

485
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,040
That's it.

486
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,720
OK.

487
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,200
Do you know

488
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,040
why I chose Seven nuestro?

489
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,840
To become my white face?

490
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,200
He's also a Taoist.

491
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,000
He's about to break through.

492
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,040
What a coincidence.

493
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,640
But what does it have to do with me?

494
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,760
The Lianming Valley

495
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,800
was once owned by the Sima clan.

496
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,960
It's a place to live.

497
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,160
But now,

498
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,600
only the dead

499
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,560
can have the right to live here.

500
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,920
So this is the protective seal

501
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,120
you found for me?

502
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,560
You can go in yourself.

503
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,920
Well.

504
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,840
I'm really alone

505
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,480
The most outstanding thing is the psychological quality

506
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,840
Relax

507
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,840
According to my posture and spiritual roots

508
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,840
From the化神期 to the練虛期

509
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,840
Usually 49 days

510
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,840
The last 30 days are the hardest

511
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,840
The most difficult is the mental condition

512
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,840
The most difficult is the mental condition

513
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,840
The most difficult is the mental condition

514
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,840
Usually 49 days

515
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,840
The thunder can weaken the thunder

516
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,840
Only Jiaojiao gave me

517
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,840
Super strong defensive weapon

518
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,840
And such a body of cultivation

519
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,840
Isn't it just 36 thunder?

520
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,840
Isn't it just 36 thunder?

521
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,840
There must be no problem

522
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,840
So fast

523
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,840
The thunder's value

524
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,840
Is to destroy my soul

525
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,840
The thunder's value

526
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,840
Is to destroy my soul

527
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,840
Is to destroy my soul

528
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,840
Is to destroy my soul

529
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,840
Is to destroy my soul

530
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,840
Is to destroy my soul

531
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,840
Is to destroy my soul

532
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,840
Is to destroy my soul

533
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,840
Is to destroy my soul

534
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,840
Is to destroy my soul

535
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,840
Is to destroy my soul

536
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,840
Is to destroy my soul

537
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,840
Is to destroy my soul

538
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,840
Is to destroy my soul

539
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,840
This is not 49 days

540
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,840
This is 99 days

541
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,840
Didn't you say that only those who are about to be reborn

542
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,840
Will have 99 days?

543
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,840
Didn't you say that only those who are about to be reborn

544
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,840
Will have 99 days?

545
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,840
I'm a化神器

546
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,840
I'm a化神器

547
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,840
Where is this thunder?

548
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,840
Sister, you want to kill me

549
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,840
I won't be the first

550
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,840
To be killed by thunder, right?

551
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,840
If I'm here

552
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,840
And I'm cut into pieces

553
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,840
That person's face will be beaten a lot

554
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,840
Let's fight again

555
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,840
Let's fight again

556
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,840
Let's fight again

557
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,840
Sit still

558
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,840
Sit still

559
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,840
Nothing will happen

560
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,840
I'm a化神器

561
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,840
I'm a化神器

I'm a化神器

I'm a化神器

564
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,840
I'm a化神器

I'm a化神器

I'm a化神器

00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,840
I'm a化神器

00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,840
I'm a化神器

I'm a化神器

00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,840
I'm a化神器

574
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,840
I'm a化神器

575
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,840
I'm a化神器

576
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,840
I'm a化神器

577
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,840
I'm a化神器

578
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,840
I'm a化神器

579
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,840
I'm a化神器

580
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,840
I'm a化神器

581
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,840
I'm a化神器

582
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,840
I'm a化神器

583
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,840
I'm a化神器

584
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,840
I'm a化神器

585
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,840
I'm a化神器

586
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,840
I'm a化神器

587
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,840
I'm a化神器

588
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,840
Meeting feeling 맞아요

589
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,840
I am too hurt

590
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:13,720
I am no

591
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:18,240
No

592
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:23,200
There are hundreds of oldest

593
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,280
I was whole

594
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,280
What's your fate?

595
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,520
I told you to sit still.

596
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,160
Why didn't you listen to me?

597
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,400
Si Ma Jiao,

598
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,120
my heart is beating so fast.

599
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,720
I don't know if it's because the thunder just now was too strong

600
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,560
and made me feel uneasy,

601
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,280
or you're too moving at this moment.

602
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,520
What's wrong?

603
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,440
What's wrong with you?

604
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,760
What's wrong with you?

605
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,720
Can you Okay?

606
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,340
May I have some fruit?

607
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,480
That one doesn't have a tree.

608
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:00,280
It might beく

609
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,880
such a big movement.

610
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,680
Will it attract others' attention?

611
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,360
The thunder onboard

612
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,200
will not attract the images of others outside.

613
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,960
This pain can be cured within ten days

614
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,880
You need much effort to prepare this

615
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:30,920
Exactly

616
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,120
How can you be the little white face

617
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,080
The skill about refrain is not harsh

618
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,520
Don't be scared

619
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,520
I don't want to get it dirty.

620
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,320
It's troublesome.

621
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,120
No.

622
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,120
I just applied the medicine.

623
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,120
If it's not dirty,

624
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,320
the wound will crack easily.

625
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,320
Just wrap it for a day.

626
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,520
Wrap it for a day, okay?

627
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,520
When the wound is a little better,

628
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,320
we'll take it apart.

629
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,120
I'm begging you.

630
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,920
I'm really worried.

631
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,920
Just wrap it.

632
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,720
I've used the Yingluo photo album you gave me.

633
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,320
I can't just leave it like this.

634
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,720
I can't just leave it like this.

635
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,120
I can't just leave it like this.

636
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,320
I can't just leave it like this.

637
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,520
You've given me the Yingluo photo album.

638
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,920
You know it's my heart.

639
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:27,920
If you don't need it,

640
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,520
it's a waste of money.

641
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,920
I'm begging you.

642
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,520
You think I can't see you're kidding?

643
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,720
What's the use of seeing it?

644
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,920
It's still very useful.

645
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,520
If I had changed to someone else,

646
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,120
with such high cultivation,

647
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,720
I would have been injured like this.

648
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,520
It would have healed very quickly.

649
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,720
But I can't do it with a silk rubber.

650
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,520
Don't worry.

651
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,520
I won't die before you do.

652
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,120
Sima Jiao.

653
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,520
Do you know that you have a faint

654
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,120
smell of blood lilies?

655
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,920
The scent is like it's coming out of blood.

656
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,920
Really?

657
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,720
In this world,

658
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,120
is it only me who can smell your scent?

659
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,720
I'm sorry.

660
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,520
I'm sorry.

661
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,720
I'm sorry.

662
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,920
You're so good at defense.

663
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,120
Did you know

664
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,520
that this thunder is not that simple?

665
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,320
Yes.

666
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,320
Because you have

667
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,720
my scent.

668
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,120
The world

669
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,720
can't tolerate me.

670
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,320
He wants to kill me.

671
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,320
Your scent is on me.

672
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,520
That's why it's so long.

673
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,920
I wanted to stay away from you

674
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,320
while you're on a break.

675
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,320
Maybe you can get away.

676
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,720
I'm a god.

677
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,320
I can't let go of your scent.

678
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,120
Why is this heaven so cruel?

679
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,920
And the Huoji Quan family.

680
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,320
I'm afraid.

681
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,320
I'm afraid I'll get you into trouble.

682
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,720
Of course I'm not afraid.

683
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,320
But it's troublesome to get rid of the poison.

684
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,720
My cultivation still can't grow too fast.

685
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,120
I'm sorry.

686
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,320
I'm sorry.

687
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,320
I'm sorry.

688
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,320
I'm sorry.

689
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,320
I'm sorry.

690
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,320
I'm sorry.

691
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,320
I'm sorry.

692
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,320
I'm sorry.

693
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,320
I'm sorry.

694
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,320
I'm sorry.

695
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,320
I'm sorry.

696
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,320
I'm sorry.

697
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,320
I'm sorry.

698
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,320
I'm sorry.

699
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,320
I'm sorry.

700
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,320
I'm sorry.

701
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,320
I'm sorry.

702
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,320
I'm sorry.

703
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,320
I'm sorry.

704
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,320
I'm sorry.

705
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,320
I'm sorry.

706
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,320
I'm sorry.

707
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,320
I'm sorry.

708
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,320
I'm sorry.

709
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,320
I'm sorry.

710
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,320
I'm sorry.

711
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,320
I'm sorry.

712
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,320
I'm sorry.

713
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:14,520
The autumn breeze is light and the stars and the moon are scattered.

714
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:18,520
It burns through the deep loneliness.

715
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:22,520
The candlelight is weak and the shadow is shattering.

716
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:26,520
Shimmering in the dark night.

717
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:30,520
I use my brush to outline the colors of the light

718
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:34,520
to warm your cold soul.

719
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,520
The memory is clear and the longing is clear.

720
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,720
But I can't touch it.

721
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:46,320
The sand is covered with the dew.

722
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:50,320
The flowers are still in full bloom.

723
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:57,320
Burn out all the fire.

724
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:02,320
I'm alone with you.

725
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:06,320
I'm going to break through the loneliness.

726
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:10,320
The rules of heaven are confused.

727
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:14,320
What's the matter with life and death?

728
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:18,320
I'm alone with you.

729
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:22,320
I'll only lose the result in the end.

730
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:26,320
Right or wrong, the rumors spread.

731
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:34,320
I'll live my life to the fullest.

732
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:38,320
For you, for me,

733
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:42,320
for the rest of my life.

734
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:46,320
The sea is warm and the rain is soft.

735
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:50,320
It's me.

736
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:54,320
For you, for me,

737
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:58,320
for the sincerity of life.

738
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:02,320
Facing the promise, it seems to fly.

739
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:06,320
I'll light up with my body.

740
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:13,320
More.
