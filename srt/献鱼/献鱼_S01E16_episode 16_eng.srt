OST credit

3
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,700
 ♫ Heavens strike with thunderous wrath ♫ 

4
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,420
 ♫ Mountains and rivers shatter before my eyes ♫ 

5
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,680
 ♫ Endless splendor
cultivated through lifetimes ♫ 

6
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,340
 ♫ Turns to dust between my fingers
in an instant ♫ 

7
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,120
 ♫ When the line
between good and evil is clear ♫ 

8
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,140
 ♫ Countless souls drift
into the boundless wilds ♫ 

9
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,600
 ♫ Carrying the spirit fire forward ♫ 

10
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,880
 ♫ I defy fate Just to remain by your side ♫ 

11
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,820
 ♫ Falling into love's abyss ♫ 

12
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,760
 ♫ Like heavy rain pouring down ♫ 

13
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,560
 ♫ Drunk on romance ♫ 

14
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,240
 ♫ In a blink, love and hate
vanish into illusion ♫ 

15
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,260
 ♫ Falling into endless love ♫ 

16
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,420
 ♫ Stirring waves upending a lifetime ♫ 

17
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,700
 ♫ Even if this life leads to ruin ♫ 

18
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,920
 ♫ I still choose to be entangled with you ♫ 

19
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,425
 ♫ Through all lifetimes ♫ 

20
00:01:30,425 --> 00:01:36,640
 

21
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,485
 

22
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,300
Not a problem.

23
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,980
Now it's yours.

24
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,600
Wow.

25
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,060
I'm touching a fish. (T/N: Slacking)

26
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,110
You're so lazy.

27
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,190
You only like touching fish when someone brings it to you.

28
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,420
This lake is known as Cloudsky Lake.

29
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,610
And this is a Soul Flying Fish.

30
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,920
It feeds on droplets

31
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,640
condensed from the purest spiritual energy.

32
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,990
That's precious.

33
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,760
Then I daren't touch it.

34
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,480
Let's release it.

35
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,840
But I heard the icy-blue fish
are good for beauty.

36
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,720
Then I must touch it.

37
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,820
After you're done touching it,

38
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:49,040
we can roast it and eat it.

39
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,760
Catching fish in someone else's lake
isn't good, is it?

40
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,420
But with you backing me up, it's fine.

41
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,940
Isn't just one fish a bit too few?

42
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,940
It's rare for me to cook.

43
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,570
I can't make just a humble spread.

44
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,350
Why is it only you who can catch those fish?

45
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,200
This is true "touching fish".

46
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,460
Doing nothing at all?

47
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,770
I won't lift even a finger now.

48
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,270
 Whoever can catch me lots of fish is the best man ever in the world! 

49
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,160
 I'd love him! I'd admire him so much! 

50
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,270
 A man who can catch them is utterly handsome! 

51
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,760
 He makes me feel so safe. 

52
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,140
 Whoever can catch these fish
must be exceptionally remarkable! 

53
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,980
Enough chatter.

54
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,880
Good job. Come, let me wipe your sweat.

55
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,980
Such a trifle doesn't make me sweat.

56
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,840
Come on.

57
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,640
Crouch lower.

58
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,580
Don't roast all the fish.

59
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,150
Make me a soup, too.

60
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,710
You want to eat them?

61
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,710
I caught them myself.

62
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,920
Can't I eat them?

63
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,150
Of course you can.

64
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,750
What could make Grandmaster, who rarely eats, suddenly demand food?

65
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:03,400
Is it the beauty fish,
or me, the slacking fish?

66
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,740
Too much noise.

67
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,830
This is divine cuisine.

68
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,910
No, it's a celestial delicacy.

69
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,830
How can fish taste so good?

70
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,680
Crispy outside, tender inside.

71
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,160
Fresh and fragrant.

72
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,520
How's the soup?

73
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,770
Taste it yourself.

74
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,140
It's so delicious, my tongue feels refreshed.

75
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,460
Nice.

76
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,420
This should be featured on television.

77
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,390
To think Grandmaster,
who rarely eats, finds it tasty.

78
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,150
It's because the ingredients here
are really good.

79
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:17,060
Such flavor with so little effort.

80
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,340
I'm heading out tomorrow.

81
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:25,250
In your words, I'm going to

82
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,980
"pursue my career".

83
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,330
This trip will take a few days.

84
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,910
If there's anything you want, tell me anytime.

85
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,760
Don't worry. I have the Transvision Mirror you gave me.

86
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,170
Pursue your career without worry.

87
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,540
Sima Jiao hides in the shadows,
while we're out in the open.

88
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,500
Finding him won't be easy.

89
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,370
Sect Master Shi, the fish
in your treasured Cloudsky Lake

90
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,680
have been stolen by the dozens.

91
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,350
What?

92
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,560
Who did this?

93
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,670
This was left by the thief at the lakeside.

94
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,000
My...

95
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,640
 There are traces of
Ting Yan's extreme-cold nature. 

96
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,760
 It seems her cultivation
has advanced further than before. 

97
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,640
My fish!

98
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,210
My...

99
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:36,010
Gengchen Celestial Palace
has grown more chaotic.

100
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:39,140
Sect Master Shi, you hardly ever catch
those Soul Flying Fish,

101
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,460
much less share them with us.

102
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,330
And now look.

103
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:48,620
They've been stolen by some nameless thief.

104
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,880
This is outrageous.

105
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,770
Who was it?

106
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,440
Sima Jiao?

107
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,990
Instead of focusing on his recovery,

108
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,560
you think he stole your fish
right under your nose?

109
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,330
The Eight Palaces are all searching for him.

110
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:09,610
If it were him,
wouldn't that be far too arrogant?

111
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,180
Exactly.

112
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:15,090
Soul Flying Fish don't do much to aid recovery.

113
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,260
If Sima Jiao were in his right mind,

114
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:22,230
he'd never take the risk of coming here to steal the fish.

115
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,230
But knowing his nature,

116
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,140
it's hard to say.

117
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:35,780
 If Sima Jiao went to
Cloudsky Lake for Ting Yan's sake, 

118
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,930
 then it makes sense. 

119
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,590
Someone.

120
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,060
Young Madam.

121
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,020
Why hasn't anyone been sent in today?

122
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,660
Young Madam, since the Grandmaster's incident,

123
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,060
all sects have tightened their defenses.

124
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,790
It's hard to find suitable female disciples.

125
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:09,180
You know the art I'm practicing
consumes my primordial spirit.

126
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,300
Why weren't you prepared earlier?

127
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,340
Please calm down, Young Madam.

128
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:25,300
Didn't you just enter Coreform recently?

129
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,260
It should be nourishing now.

130
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,190
Spare me, Young Madam.

131
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,260
Please spare me, Young Madam.

132
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,750
Chu Hui!

133
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,970
Mother.

134
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:54,850
Chu Hui, where did you learn such evil arts?

135
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:57,020
Mother.

136
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,970
I went to great lengths
to obtain this secret art.

137
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,570
Otherwise, without the Grandmaster's reward,

138
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:06,690
how else could I have advanced
into Soulshift so quickly?

139
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:11,520
Young Madam, you should know
shortcuts will harm you.

140
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,900
That's why I need disciples
to replenish myself.

141
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,190
Don't worry, Mother.

142
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:19,310
The ones I choose are nobodies.

143
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,610
No one will notice even if they die.

144
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,730
So, how come I know about it now?

145
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:27,980
I've heard the rumors that you're absorbing
female disciples' cultivation.

146
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,870
It won't be long before the other palace heads come after you.

147
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:40,590
I can't believe you,
the daughter of a Palace Madam,

148
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:43,000
would actually practice such demonic arts.

149
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,530
How am I to face the others?

150
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,730
But Mother, you're the Palace Madam.

151
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:51,910
Even if they find out, why bother with them?

152
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,790
I can't stop halfway.

153
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,040
Madam, why not send Young Madam
to the Luo River Immortal District?

154
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,420
She can ease her mind there.

155
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:06,430
Also, the place is remote,
and it houses foreign sects.

156
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,160
Even if something happens,
they won't dare make a scene here.

157
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,380
Luo River Immortal District?

158
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,450
That's far away.

159
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,160
You're right.

160
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,070
It's decided.

161
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,990
If calamity ever happens in the Inner Court, you can avoid it.

162
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,420
Mother, what calamity could there be?

163
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,430
I don't want to go so far.

164
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,070
It's decided.

165
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:30,120
You'll set out soon.

166
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,710
Mother.

167
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:45,880
 I've been feeling irritable
for no reason lately. 

168
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,990
 My chest feels tight. 

169
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,830
 Why not go out shopping to relax? 

170
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,070
Let's stroll the market.

171
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,430
We have enough gems.

172
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:00,060
We're not going back empty-handed today.

173
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,940
Yes, Miss.

174
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,790
Miss, Cloud Robe Embroidery House says

175
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,000
your orders from a few days ago are ready.

176
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,550
Shall we visit there first?

177
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,940
So soon? Very well.

178
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,670
Let's go there first.

179
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,090
Miss, you truly care about your brother.

180
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,590
You even had an artifact custom-made for him.

181
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:24,420
I've always accepted his gifts
without giving anything in return.

182
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,430
It doesn't feel right.

183
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,930
Let's go.

184
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,139
 

185
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,940
Miss Yong, it's been days.

186
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,740
Please come inside.

187
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,090
Here.

188
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,790
Have a seat.

189
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,220
Please have some tea.

190
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,540
Miss Yong, as you instructed,

191
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,640
we have engraved the patterns on the artifact.

192
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,090
Well done.

193
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,890
As expected of the famed shop
in the Luo River Immortal District.

194
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,190
Miss, besides jewelry and ornaments,

195
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,780
we also have fine fabrics.

196
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,940
A new batch just arrived.

197
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:13,180
Since you're here, shall I show you some?

198
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,120
One moment, please.

199
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,400
Miss Yong, have a look at this silk brocade.

200
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,310
The design is no ordinary flower.

201
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,180
It's called Moonshade Bloom.

202
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,030
Special indeed.

203
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:36,250
Surely you've heard of the renowned Sima Clan of Gengchen Celestial Palace.

204
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,760
Moonshade Bloom is their companion flower.

205
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,590
Rarely seen by anyone.

206
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,140
Only we have this pattern.

207
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,900
The flower doesn't seem right,

208
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,260
but the fabric itself is lovely.

209
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,980
Have you seen
Moonshade Bloom before, Miss Yong?

210
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,610
That's a rare flower.

211
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:00,590
How could someone like me ever see it?

212
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:07,850
I was saying the design looks new.

213
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,830
This brocade is scarce.

214
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,710
We only receive a dozen bolts each year.

215
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,620
It's always in high demand.

216
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:18,310
Since you've introduced it so earnestly,
I'll take them all.

217
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,260
Sure. Please wait a moment.

218
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,650
Silk brocade...

219
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,640
I'm truly sorry, Miss Yong.

220
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,540
The Moonshade Bloom Silk Brocade has already been reserved by another client.

221
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,760
I failed to check and didn't know.

222
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,760
To make amends,

223
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,450
you may freely choose 20 bolts of new fabric as compensation.

224
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,760
What do you say?

225
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,810
I think someone's deliberately
snatching that from my young lady.

226
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:03,160
- You slight us because you look down on us.
- Exactly.

227
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,960
Do you know our young lady is from the Yong family of the Night Palace,

228
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,850
and the granddaughter
of Patriarch Mu Xiu of the Mu Clan?

229
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:12,000
She's in a bad mood today.

230
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,300
Woe to you.

231
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,380
Am I right, miss?

232
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,020
Was I in a bad mood?

233
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,480
We were in the right at first.

234
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,290
But you've gone too far and made me look like an unruly woman.

235
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,400
It's my fault.

236
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,070
Merely the Night Palace.

237
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,910
 - See, you talked too much. 
- Young Madam, please come inside.

238
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:38,330
Even if the palace head of Night Palace and Patriarch Mu Xiu himself were here,

239
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:43,450
they would kneel and kowtow before me.

240
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:46,360
 Yes, I'm the daughter
of the Mistress of Moon Palace. 

241
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,670
There's an order to observe.

242
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:50,970
Why should we give way to others?

243
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:54,400
It's always been others going my way.

244
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,400
I've set my eyes on
this Moonshade Bloom brocade.

245
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,500
Don't ever think of taking it.

246
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,900
They outnumber us.

247
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,120
It's better to leave first.

248
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,280
Since you like it so much, it's yours.

249
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,770
Let's go.

250
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:13,350
Did I allow you to leave?

251
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,730
There's an aura about you that feels familiar,

252
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,530
and I loathe it.

253
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,040
You act all meek and submissive on the surface,

254
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,100
but deep down, you look down on everyone.

255
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,310
We... We've never met before.

256
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:33,820
- You must've mistaken me for someone else.
- Did I tell you to speak?

257
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,240
How dare you fight back?

258
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,360
Teach her a harsh lesson.

259
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,260
Don't go too far.

260
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,080
Be careful not to kill her.

261
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,645
She's in Soulshift.

262
00:18:02,645 --> 00:18:05,827
 

263
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,620
Not only your aura,

264
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,280
but even your face, I simply hate it.

265
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,590
And you're a Soulshift.

266
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,240
Since you're so weak,

267
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,340
surrender all your cultivation to me.

268
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,000
We have no grudges against each other.

269
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,770
Don't push me.

270
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,110
If I'm hurt,

271
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:38,250
you'll be in danger as well.

272
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,730
Ridiculous!

273
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:42,440
I'm fully armed
with heaven-class defensive artifacts.

274
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,800
A mere Soulshift like you can't even touch me.

275
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,580
What evil act is that? It hurts me.

276
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,240
Evil art?

277
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,100
I didn't mean to destroy your artifact.

278
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,490
You didn't mean it?

279
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:01,600
How brazen...

280
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,440
How brazen of you!

281
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,730
Lord Han, Lord Jiao Feng.

282
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,390
Put her in her place.

283
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,590
Smash her bones, but don't kill her.

284
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:15,810
Once I'm satisfied, I'll claim her life myself.

285
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,470
Madam Ye.

286
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,240
Are you bringing medicine to Madam Yue?

287
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:41,000
Madam Ye, the Young Madam
suffered frostbite yesterday.

288
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,530
It looks superficial at first, as if the ointment would heal it immediately.

289
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:47,790
But for some reason, ordinary frostbite remedies didn't work.

290
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,560
So, we asked Sect Master Shi for some rare and unusual remedies.

291
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,310
An unusual frostbite?

292
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:56,210
Did Young Madam fight with someone?

293
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,090
Yes.

294
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:00,770
That girl is still being held
by the Young Madam in the side palace.

295
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,010
May I see her?

296
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,560
Yes, Madam Ye.

297
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,870
Who is she?

298
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:21,360
She claims to be
the young lady of Night Palace.

299
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:31,020
 Her body carries the spiritual power of the extreme-cold nature. 

300
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:34,680
 If Sima Jiao could turn Ting Yan into an otter, 

301
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,960
 then turning her
into someone else is not impossible. 

302
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,180
- Was she alone when you captured her?
- Yes.

303
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,940
Only a few useless guards
and maids at her side,

304
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,560
no one else.

305
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:58,240
These are wounds from advanced spells.

306
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,400
They can't be healed by common spells.

307
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,680
Besides the external injuries,

308
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,770
her internal wounds are just as serious.

309
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,920
This is too cruel.

310
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,050
 I need to bring Ting Yan back for treatment. 

311
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:14,290
 But with Ting Yan here, 

312
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:17,270
 it's the best chance to hunt down Sima Jiao. 

313
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,750
Let's leave.

314
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,940
Are you sure that woman is Liao Ting Yan?

315
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,370
Yes.

316
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,380
If you set an ambush in advance,

317
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,770
Sima Jiao is sure to be drawn here.

318
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,530
Send word to all palaces.

319
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,270
We set out at once.

320
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,310
We came as soon as we received the news.

321
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,160
Any news about Sima Jiao?

322
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:58,860
Fellow palace heads, Sima Jiao is injured,

323
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,070
and his strength is greatly reduced.

324
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:06,770
Today, we must seize him without fail.

325
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:10,530
You're using my daughter as bait.

326
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:13,100
How can you guarantee her safety?

327
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,210
Madam Yue,

328
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,450
given Sima Jiao's current condition,

329
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:19,340
even if I can't defeat him,

330
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,860
I can at least fight him to a draw.

331
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,790
That will be enough for us
to complete the sealing

332
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:26,140
and save your daughter.

333
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:30,600
Madam Yue, no risk, no glory.

334
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,650
Once this is done,

335
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,860
you'll be the leader of the Eight Palaces.

336
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,090
Then what are we waiting for?

337
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,210
I...

338
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:45,220
I mean, if we delay any longer,
my daughter will be in danger.

339
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,510
Move out!

340
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,454
 

341
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,410
Ting Yan.

342
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,420
 Liao Ting Yan is in danger. 

343
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:15,630
 The Eight Palaces are heading
toward the suburbs of Mount Ziliu. 

344
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,970
Grandmaster, let me go with you.

345
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,480
You haven't recovered yet.

346
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,000
I can at least support you.

347
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,200
This is likely a trap by Shi Qian Lv.

348
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,350
Think twice.

349
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,000
Ting Yan is my good friend.

350
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,870
You are my master.

351
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,730
If you go to save her,

352
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:34,300
I will follow without hesitation.

353
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,960
Why are you standing there?

354
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,180
The clothes are ready, Young Madam.

355
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,310
Please try them on.

356
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,820
What's the point of trying them?

357
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,720
But the clothes...

358
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:00,960
Your strength...

359
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,460
My cultivation has slowed down
without those disciples.

360
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,874
Where is the Soulshift girl I brought back a few days ago?

361
00:24:09,874 --> 00:24:12,580
She's still locked up.

362
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,190
Have Lord Han bring her to me.

363
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,100
Ting Yan.

364
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,670
Ting Yan.

365
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:46,220
Does it hurt, Ting Yan?

366
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,360
It's fine.

367
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,100
You're lying.

368
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,970
I'm unwell.

369
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:56,940
It hurts me terribly.

370
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,820
You finally came to save me.

371
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:05,860
 ♫ In the world of madness,
love burdened with greed ♫ 

372
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,900
If their cultivation were lower than mine,

373
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,450
I would've risked fighting them.

374
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:17,050
But several of them are in Soulshift,

375
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:20,000
fighting them would be suicide.

376
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:34,240
 ♫ The tale of fate keeps winding on ♫ 

377
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,680
I didn't feel much before.

378
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,370
But once I saw you, the pain came.

379
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:46,910
Talk to me.

380
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:51,930
If you talk, I won't feel the pain.

381
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,360
 ♫ Through every trial we've endured ♫ 

382
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,720
 ♫ No matter who has sought the cure ♫ 

383
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:06,800
 ♫ Love is the thread that mends the scar ♫ 

384
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:11,400
 ♫ For you, my tears still burn like fire ♫ 

385
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,380
Ouch!

386
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,080
It hurts.

387
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:27,440
 ♫ Guiding the hope of love ♫ 

388
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,700
 ♫ Why must we suffer all this? ♫ 

389
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:35,010
 ♫ Piercing us through every season ♫ 

390
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,500
All right. I don't hurt anymore.

391
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:45,360
 ♫ Then wish upon the stars ♫ 

392
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,840
 ♫ Reborn beyond souls ♫ 

393
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:55,020
 ♫ May this chain of enduring fate ♫ 

394
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,930
Where are we going?

395
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:07,180
You're not planning to kill someone, are you?

396
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,530
Of course I am.

397
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:11,450
Yue Chu Hui is the Young Madam of Moon Palace.

398
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:14,100
You'll expose yourself.

399
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,380
Up ahead is Mount Ziliu Manor.

400
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,440
My daughter is there.

401
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:34,420
What's such a big deal
about this Yong Ling Chun?

402
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,510
Why make such a scene?

403
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:46,330
How dare you! Who allowed you in?

404
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,000
Lord Han, Lord of Jiao Feng.

405
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,050
I don't care who you are,
my guards will be here soon.

406
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:57,360
When they do, none of you is getting away.

407
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,950
G-Grandmaster.

408
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,920
Liao Ting Yan?

409
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:12,510
Grandmaster.

410
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,380
Don't come closer, Grandmaster.

411
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,980
My mother will rescue me soon!

412
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:37,440
There they are.

413
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,770
Chu Hui.

414
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:15,720
Mother, save me!

415
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,980
Release my daughter, Sima Jiao!

416
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,970
Grandmaster, they're setting up
the sealing array.

417
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:24,250
We're surrounded.

418
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,830
I know.

419
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,490
Be patient, Madam Yue.

420
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:34,130
Don't forget our priority is sealing Sima Jiao.

421
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,700
You do it.

422
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,020
Strip her face.

423
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,320
And kill her.

424
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,980
No.

425
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:58,180
She bullied you and hurt you.

426
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,600
You have to avenge yourself.

427
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,860
She scarred your face,

428
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,180
then you strip hers.

429
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,140
She had others beat you,

430
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,690
then you crush every single bone of her.

431
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,410
She made you suffer,

432
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,400
then you make her die in agony.

433
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,950
I was wrong, Grandmaster.

434
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:22,280
- Please spare me.
- Kill her.

435
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,200
Sima Jiao, the Eight Palace Heads are all here.

436
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,590
If you release my daughter,

437
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,490
everything can be negotiated.

438
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:34,840
But if anything happens to her,
I'll take your life!

439
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,790
Noisy.

440
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,100
Jiao, my stomach hurts.

441
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,450
It isn't serious.

442
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,420
Let's go back first.

443
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,360
- Yes?
- No.

444
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,620
My inner injuries are serious.

445
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,700
If you don't heal me, I'll die.

446
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:05,420
I'm so afraid of pain.

447
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,740
Please, Grandmaster.

448
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,360
Are you sure you don't want to do it?

449
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,380
I'm not pretending.

450
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,970
Let's go back first.

451
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:17,600
All right?

452
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,400
Fine.

453
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:23,150
If you won't kill her,

454
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,420
I won't force you.

455
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:30,490
It looks like the Eight Palaces
are hunting us down,

456
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:33,530
and you're still wounded.

457
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:38,090
Let's negotiate with them with Yue Chu Hui and retreat first.

458
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,990
I'll do anything you ask.

459
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,570
But this person

460
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,640
must pay the price.

461
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:51,840
No, Grandmaster.

462
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,150
Please don't.

463
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,810
No.

464
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:04,140
Chu Hui!

465
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,110
Hold yourself together, Madam Yue.

466
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:12,420
Didn't you say you could save her?

467
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,450
I should've rushed in long ago,

468
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:17,340
not wasted time here with you.

469
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,180
What use is it if you rush in alone?

470
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,200
Do you stand a chance?

471
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,900
Your daughter only lost her cultivation.

472
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,830
At least her life is spared.

473
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:27,830
Don't lose focus, Madam Yue.

474
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:30,200
Hold yourself together.

475
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:36,290
I must kill you two to atone for my daughter.

476
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:43,520
You think your array can hold me long?

477
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:47,010
Sima Jiao, if you could break it,

478
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,420
you'd have done so already.

479
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,070
After the battle at Baifeng Mountain,

480
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:52,110
you were gravely injured
and haven't recovered yet.

481
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:54,160
Am I right?

482
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,590
Whether or not I have recovered,

483
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:03,050
you can come here and try me.

484
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,090
 Stop it, Ru Ling. 

485
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,460
 Ru Ling, if you persist,
how can we still be friends? 

486
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,490
From the moment I swore to kill Sima Jiao,

487
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:59,310
I knew this day would come.

488
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:01,820
 Are all the days we shared 

489
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,290
 going to end here? 

490
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:04,780
Yes.

491
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,010
Liao Ting Yan, Hei Nian Jiu,

492
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:13,820
the next time we meet,

493
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,920
I won't hold back.

494
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,980
Sima Jiao.

495
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:30,920
I knew you hadn't healed yet.

496
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,860
The Spirit Fire is truly robust.

497
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:38,560
Even gravely injured,
you can still fight me this long.

498
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,780
The array is nearly complete.

499
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:51,190
Sima Jiao, your number is up.

500
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,860
Sima Jiao.

501
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,400
Sima Jiao.

502
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:02,190
This is the moment I've been waiting for.

503
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,760
How could this be?

504
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:30,400
 Could someone within the Eight Palaces
have helped him? 

505
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:33,260
Chu Hui.

506
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:35,620
Chu Hui!

507
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:51,080
Madam Ye.

508
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:56,400
I saw you speaking
with those flying kites just now.

509
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,900
What were you talking about?

510
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,220
They tried to convince me
to go easy on Sima Jiao,

511
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,250
but I refused.

512
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,850
Are you suspecting me, Sect Master Shi?

513
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:13,840
You and Liao Ting Yan are close friends.

514
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,820
And you're also tight with that black serpent.

515
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:23,840
You can't blame me
for being suspicious, Madam Ye.

516
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,130
You're overthinking it, Sect Master Shi.

517
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,630
Come, sit down.

518
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,590
How do you feel now?

519
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:58,230
I'm fine. It's just a small wound.

520
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:00,900
Your injuries haven't healed yet.

521
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,900
How did you break the seal?

522
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,260
Back in the array,

523
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:08,860
you told me you needed help from one of the Eight Palaces,

524
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:13,380
so you sent me to persuade Ru Ling, right?

525
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,340
Ye Ru Ling was just a pretense.

526
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:19,030
The one who helped was Yuan Che.

527
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:23,710
What if he betrayed you,
or couldn't help at all?

528
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:26,000
Wouldn't that even have been more dangerous?

529
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,900
When it comes to saving you,
there's no such thing as "what if".

530
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:34,440
You knew it was a deadly trap,

531
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,740
and you couldn't defeat them,

532
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:39,130
but you still risked it for me.

533
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,630
Who says I couldn't defeat them?

534
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,840
Yes, you could.

535
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,340
I didn't expect you'd learn
how to work with others.

536
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:54,820
It's his honor across
three lifetimes to aid me.

537
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,800
There's no such thing as collaboration.

538
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:05,730
You should learn
to ask others for help more often.

539
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:11,630
Since you already had Yuan Che as your backup,

540
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:14,260
why send me to persuade Ru Ling

541
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:17,220
and release those flying kites for all to see?

542
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:20,090
To not arouse Shi Qian Lv's suspicion,

543
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:23,820
I needed someone convincing to mislead him.

544
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:27,170
So, Ru Ling was just Yuan Che's decoy?

545
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:30,620
But she's my friend.

546
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,480
I forgot.

547
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,550
She and I aren't friends anymore.

548
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,050
Losing a false friend
is nothing worth brooding over.

549
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:49,520
You don't make friends,

550
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,410
so you wouldn't understand.

551
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,960
You're taking it out on me.

552
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,480
I'm sorry.

553
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:09,360
I've just been
so irritable lately for no reason.

554
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,940
It gets worse when I think of Ru Ling.

555
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:16,280
I feel so stifled, as if something's pressing on my chest.

556
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:22,030
You've been feeling like this lately?

557
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,880
I don't know why.

558
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,650
This frustration just came out of nowhere.

559
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:37,990
Let's heal your wounds first

560
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:41,220
before dealing with your troubles.

561
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:02,440
 Stop it, Ru Ling. 

562
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:08,130
 Ru Ling, if you persist,
how can we still be friends? 

563
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,940
 Are you alone, too? 

564
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:13,880
 Are you also a slacker, just like me? 

565
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,150
 You never looked down on me? 

566
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:17,360
 I admire you so much. 

567
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,880
 We're good friends from now on. 

568
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,400
 Yes. 

569
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:30,570
 Are all the days we shared going to end here? 

570
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:31,950
 Yes. 

571
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:40,020
 Your eyes are sparkling. 

572
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,440
 So beautiful. 

573
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,630
 I was a serpent before. 

574
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:48,630
 You gave me the chance to become human. 

575
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,840
 You gave me life. 

576
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,200
 If you want to take it back, 

577
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,690
 go ahead. 

578
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:03,740
 Master, this is my gift as your disciple. 

579
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,780
 If I call for you with this... 

580
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,150
 If you need me, 

581
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:09,730
 I'll appear by your side anytime. 

582
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,440
 Hurry. 

583
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,110
 Get moving. 

584
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:33,990
 Why are you lying down? Get up. 

585
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:36,220
 Hey, move faster. 

586
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:41,090
 Now, the Sima Clan has only Sima Jiao left. 

587
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:45,920
 Once he's dead, we can return to our homeland. 

588
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:51,550
 Ting Yan, Nian Jiu, forgive me. 

589
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:55,010
 I've failed you. 

590
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,710
 I don't live for myself alone. 

591
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:01,670
 I must bring my people home. 

592
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:06,960
 I'm sorry for letting you down. 

593
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:40,970


594
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:48,520
