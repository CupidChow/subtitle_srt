 "In This World, I Only Love You" - TIA RAY 

3
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,600
♫  Let the heavens release a mighty thunder tribulation  ♫

4
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,320
♫  Leading mountains and rivers so mighty and vast to shatter before my eyes  ♫

5
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,680
♫  Lifetimes of cultivation bring years of splendor   ♫

6
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,340
♫  Yet turn to dust between fingers in an instant  ♫

7
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,120
♫  When immortals and demons discern good and evil with a single thought  ♫

8
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,240
♫  Many souls escape into the endless wilderness  ♫

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,700
♫  I journey forward with the Spirit Fire in my veins  ♫

10
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,880
♫  I defy fate just to remain by your side  ♫

11
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,880
♫  Falling thousands of feet in love is like heavy rain,   ♫

12
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,760
♫  Pouring down between heaven and earth  ♫

13
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,580
♫  Drunk in love  ♫

14
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,240
♫  Love and hate vanish in an instant  ♫

15
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,240
♫  Falling into an endless abyss of love  ♫

16
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,520
♫  Stirring waves upending a lifetime  ♫

17
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,660
♫  Even if this life leads to ruin  ♫

18
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:27,020
♫  I'd still choose to be entangled with you  ♫

19
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,325
♫  Through all lifetimes  ♫

20
00:01:30,325 --> 00:01:36,540
   

21
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,415
   

22
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,940
 That Demon Realm spy... 

23
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,190
 eased quite a bit of the Spirit Fire's burn for me. 

24
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,840
 Maybe... 

25
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,240
 I can force the seal open. 

26
00:02:29,377 --> 00:02:31,047
Mr. Snake.

27
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,220
Look at that sunset glow!

28
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,790
Let's go check it out and clear our heads a bit.

29
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,040
Immortal scenic spots are really something else!

30
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,190
What's the matter, Mr. Snake?

31
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,870
What is that?

32
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:28,210
Why does it feel so oppressive?

33
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,490
 Sima Jiao, are you insane? 

34
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:35,620
 You know full well this seal can't be forced open! 

35
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,570
♫  If hearts can be sealed...  ♫

36
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:43,260
 It looks like a seal. 

37
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,970
 Could it be tied to Grandmaster? 

38
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,490
 I know that girl eased your Spirit Fire pain, 

39
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,890
 but this is a seal formed by the bloodlines of all Eight Great Palaces. 

40
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:54,340
 No one can break it! 

41
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,890
 If you keep acting recklessly, it can kill you! 

42
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,800
 Sima Jiao! 

43
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:10,610
 See? I told you it wouldn't work. 

44
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:15,860
 The more you try to break it, the deeper those nails will drive into you. 

45
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,250
 Stop wasting your strength. 

46
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,960
Shut up.

47
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,690
The Grandmaster's been here for 500 years.

48
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:28,310
You mean he wasn't in seclusion but sealed here all this time?

49
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,710
So, he's not a demon,

50
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,640
but the Monkey King.

51
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,060
No wonder he can't sleep and keeps going crazy.

52
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,340
Such a situation will drive anyone mad.

53
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,780
♫  I watch the changes of all beings in the world  ♫

54
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,510
I've figured out how to win our boss over!

55
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,380
Grandmaster.

56
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,530
Grandmaster.

57
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,140
Grandmaster.

58
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,370
Grandmaster...

59
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,210
Why are you here?

60
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:32,510
 Were those scars on him left when he was sealed? 

61
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,390
Who let you wander in here?

62
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:39,380
Sorry, I didn't mean to intrude!

63
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,190
Speak up.

64
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,300
Why are you here?

65
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:51,650
I heard you had worries, so I came to try and cheer you up.

66
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,440
What worries can I have?

67
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,140
But...

68
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:03,330
I thought of something that might make you a little happy.

69
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,260
Make me happy?

70
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,960
It worked!

71
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,370
I used the cultivation you boosted for me to make this.

72
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,060
How's that?

73
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:30,920
♫  Snow has not stopped, flame is still burning  ♫

74
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,080
I boosted your cultivation,

75
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,580
and you used it for this?

76
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:40,020
Doesn't this make you happy? So why not?

77
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,160
♫  Nobody can reach yet nobody listens  ♫

78
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,040
♫  Thousands of stars in your eyes  ♫

79
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:52,240
♫  Turn into fireworks, fading away  ♫

80
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,250
♫  Unwilling to be entangled by fate, like the passing of geese  ♫

81
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,230
Ridiculous.

82
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:03,430
To me, these little tricks...

83
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,060
♫  Reincarnating to flames raging around  ♫

84
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,380
So pretty.

85
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,970
Well?

86
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,280
Feeling any cooler now?

87
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,940
Come on, Boss.

88
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,000
Don't waste that gorgeous face on a scowl!

89
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:35,640
♫  Love is too crazy, blooming a lotus in the heart  ♫

90
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:09,230
Besides snow, your cultivation can do much more for you.

91
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:26,870
The night of the new moon is coming.

92
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:30,510
I've been locked here for 500 years...

93
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:37,840
Power suppressed, tortured daily...

94
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,330
So, Sima Jiao does have a weakness.

95
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,920
We must inform the Master at once.

96
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,280
Wait.

97
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,330
The Three Saints Mountain only lets you in, never out.

98
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:59,660
If we cost our lives to send word, Sima Jiao will grow suspicious.

99
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,450
And Liao Tingyan stays in the Central Tower every day.

100
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:07,470
We have to get her away from Sima Jiao, so that she won't ruin the new moon plan.

101
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:11,210
With her cultivation, she's no threat to us yet.

102
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,750
Not for now.

103
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:17,190
But if she trains under Sima Jiao, none of us will be able to beat her.

104
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,930
So, you're saying...

105
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,990
Killing two birds with one stone and escaping with a crafty plan.

106
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:26,020
Plenty of people have their eyes on Sima Jiao.

107
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:29,290
Doesn't Star Palace have one?

108
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,730
Sis, have you heard?

109
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:39,630
Liao Tingyan from Four Seasons Palace is moving into the inner hall soon.

110
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:44,620
She only just won the Grandmaster's favor, and now she's living with him?

111
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,020
What did this woman do?

112
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,450
If she gets ahead of us, Star Palace will be...

113
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,990
We can't let her run wild.

114
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,640
Let's go.

115
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,330
Mr. Snake.

116
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:09,810
Look, with my amazing drawing skills, I've captured your majestic presence.

117
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,020
You're mad, huh?

118
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,450
Trust me, Ruling values her friends.

119
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,970
Next time, I'll plead with her for you.

120
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,600
She'll return your snake heart.

121
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,780
What are you doing?

122
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,670
Instead of serving the Grandmaster,

123
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,360
you've got time to lounge and paint out here in the breeze.

124
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,900
That's disrespectful to him!

125
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,540
Don't waste words on her.

126
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,480
Let's get to work.

127
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,940
I didn't offend you, did I?

128
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,090
Let's talk this out.

129
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,280
No need to get physical.

130
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,140
Enough talk! Sis, now!

131
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,300
Today, I'll teach you a lesson on the Grandmaster's behalf!

132
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,810
I just want to be a slacker.

133
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,870
Why is it so hard?

134
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:16,880
They grabbed Liao Tingyan to force me to act.

135
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,680
She's just a Demon Realm spy.

136
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,780
I only need her alive to help me with the plan.

137
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:29,790
Her wounds are no concern of mine.

138
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:41,040
I told you, I have no agenda.

139
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,850
Besides, how would I dare set my sights on the Grandmaster?

140
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:48,450
With so many disciples here, why would he choose you?

141
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,490
You must have used some trick.

142
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:54,980
Today, I'll rid the Grandmaster of this disgrace!

143
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:13,730
How is a three-spiritual-root this tricky to handle?

144
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:17,720
Sis, forcing our power like this will drain our vitality.

145
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,850
Too late to worry now!

146
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:24,180
You've gone too far!

147
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,470
How does this thing work?

148
00:13:34,031 --> 00:13:35,260
 So hot! 

149
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,230
 It worked! 

150
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:39,980
 I used the cultivation you boosted for me to make this. 

151
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:44,420
 I boosted your cultivation, and you used it for this? 

152
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,020
 Doesn't this make you happy? 

153
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,840
 So, why not? 

154
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,900
Sis, while we can, let's kill her.

155
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,890
End the threat for good!

156
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,090
- Grandmaster! 
 - Grandmaster!

157
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:19,750
Three Saints Mountain isn't a place for you to act recklessly.

158
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,210
- Spare us, Grandmaster! 
 - Spare us, Grandmaster!

159
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,080
- Spare us, Grandmaster! 
 - Spare us, Grandmaster!

160
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:02,300
I was finally having some fun, and you ruined it.

161
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,220
Why did you kill her?

162
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:10,330
She only joined Four Seasons Palace recently,

163
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,180
and her cultivation is low.

164
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,810
While I... I'm here to serve you.

165
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:18,220
How could I let someone like that remain by your side?

166
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,730
Speak up.

167
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,380
Why are you here?

168
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,900
I came to be your concubine.

169
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:32,870
I want a child with the Sima clan's atavistic bloodline.

170
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:36,420
Once the Fengshan Clan has an heir,

171
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:40,320
we'll trap and kill you, take the Spirit Fire,

172
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,470
and rid Gengchen Celestial Palace of a great threat.

173
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:49,400
Then Star Palace will rule the Gengchen Celestial Palace.

174
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,760
And I... will be the next Palace Mistress.

175
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,880
And you? What are you here for?

176
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,230
I hate Yun Xiyue.

177
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,510
I came to steal her chance.

178
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:14,070
After all these years, you're still playing the same tired tricks.

179
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:17,330
The atavistic bloodline might not appear once in a thousand years.

180
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:21,690
If I die, the Gengchen Celestial Palace is finished.

181
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,530
Forget your palace heads and lineage heads.

182
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:28,630
You'll all die with me!

183
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,630
Understood?

184
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,810
Grandmaster, I...

185
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,570
Now...

186
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,090
there is just one last step.

187
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:35,510
 Looks like I'll have to take the time to teach her how to kill. 

188
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,040
Tingyan!

189
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,390
Grandmaster.

190
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,960
What happened to Tingyan?

191
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,760
Xiyue and Wanqing are dead!

192
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,790
He didn't even leave a trace of their spirit.

193
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:50,030
How could he strike so viciously?

194
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,780
Is he truly without principle?

195
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,640
What principle can he have?

196
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,330
The disciples we send keep dying.

197
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,880
If he weren't trapped in Three Saints Mountain,

198
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:05,120
I fear he'd have wiped out the entire Gengchen Celestial Palace by now.

199
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,320
Another light's gone out.

200
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,380
It's someone from the Yin Palace!

201
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:23,370
Master, I sacrificed my life to send my soul out and bring you this message.

202
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,880
What news is so important?

203
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,050
Today, we secretly slipped into the Grandmaster's Central Tower.

204
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,840
 The night of the new moon is coming. 

205
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,970
 I've been locked here for 500 years... 

206
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:44,970
 Power suppressed, tortured daily. 

207
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:51,210
 And that night will be when I'm weakest. 

208
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:58,890
 You must guard me well, 

209
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,630
 or else... 

210
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,920
 my life will be in danger. 

211
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:08,100
The night of the new moon is his only weakness in 500 years.

212
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:25,690
The Grandmaster is now the only one who can sustain the Fengshan Spirit Fire.

213
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:30,810
If someone uses this chance to harm him, what then?

214
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:34,330
We all know how powerful he is.

215
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:39,200
When he was just a boy, our elders spent everything they had

216
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,230
and gathered all Eight Palaces' bloodlines to seal him.

217
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:47,060
Master Di, Master Yang, and Master Yin, you took part as well.

218
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,510
You know it best!

219
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:52,770
Will a single night of the new moon truly weaken him that much?

220
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:57,660
We'll see if the spirit vein weakens on the night itself.

221
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,240
If he's truly weak,

222
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,210
the entire Gengchen Celestial Palace's spirit vein will naturally weaken, too

223
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:07,510
The sealing nails in him keep him from taking his own life.

224
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:10,590
That part can't be faked.

225
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,790
Everyone,

226
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:16,960
this concerns the Grandmaster and the entire Gengchen Celestial Palace.

227
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,780
Tomorrow night is the new moon.

228
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:24,950
If the spirit vein shifts, we must guard him at once.

229
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,000
   

230
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,470
Tingyan, you're awake.

231
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,300
Ruling...

232
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,700
When I got there, you were already out cold.

233
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,360
I don't know what happened, either.

234
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,230
But I smelled blood everywhere.

235
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:05,860
Maybe some disciples angered him and were killed.

236
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:12,120
Sima Jiao can be a bit odd at times,

237
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,940
but from what I've seen, he's not a bloodthirsty man.

238
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,020
I remember now.

239
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:23,050
Before I fainted, Yun Xiyue and Hua Wanqing were coming after me.

240
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,670
I was even hurt.

241
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:30,960
But I just checked, and there's no trace of injury.

242
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,920
Could Sima Jiao have saved me?

243
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,300
The Grandmaster would save someone?

244
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,340
Could he...

245
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,650
Could the Grandmaster...

246
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,870
really have feelings for you?

247
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,620
Impossible.

248
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,140
It's definitely because I'm his walking air conditioner.

249
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:03,640
I mean I can cool him down, and ease the Spirit Fire's burning.

250
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,180
 The Spirit Fire isn't ordinary, 

251
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,760
 and Tingyan's body can cool Sima Jiao. 

252
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,690
 Could she have the extreme-cold nature from the Demon Realm? 

253
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,820
So, that's it.

254
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,360
Oh, right.

255
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:26,580
Thanks to Black Serpent for tipping me off, I made it in time today.

256
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:32,210
Speaking of Mr. Snake, he's actually quite nice.

257
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,350
Last time, it was just a misunderstanding.

258
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:39,040
Ruling, can you return his snake heart?

259
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,560
 Luckily, Tingyan's fine. 

260
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,200
 I owe Black Serpent my thanks. 

261
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:02,950
Mr. Snake, have you been well lately?

262
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:07,420
No, "been well" doesn't sound right here.

263
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,940
I was too reckless before.

264
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,990
I thought you'd swallowed my best friend Tingyan,

265
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:17,640
and that was why I misunderstood you.

266
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,820
Today, I'll apologize to you.

267
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:26,520
I heard you like this drink, so I brought it.

268
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,760
You want this, right?

269
00:25:05,723 --> 00:25:08,003
What happened to you...

270
00:25:11,244 --> 00:25:13,584
Mr. Snake...

271
00:25:13,584 --> 00:25:16,540
What... What did you do to me?

272
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,300
When I received this...

273
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,210
When I got this heart of yours,

274
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:24,680
I always kept it with me and never touched it.

275
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,910
I turned into a human!

276
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,710
Ruling, it's all thanks to you!

277
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:32,820
Ruling...

278
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,950
Look, I've waited so long for this day!

279
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,260
Thank you, I mean it.

280
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:41,030
Though I don't know what method you used,

281
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,550
I became human today.

282
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,000
Thank you.

283
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:23,780
Ruling, thank you for giving me a chance to be human.

284
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:38,297
 Tomorrow night is the new moon. 

285
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,560
 This is my chance. 

286
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,620
 I can't miss it. 

287
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,210
Grandmaster!

288
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:06,840
It's me. I've taken human form.

289
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:15,510
It happened after Ye Ruling returned my heart.

290
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:19,550
I don't know what she did, but I could take human form.

291
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:23,040
After all the blood you drank from me,

292
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,250
you could've turned long ago.

293
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:30,460
Yes, that's how it should be.

294
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:34,150
Back then, you fed me with your own flesh and blood,

295
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:36,250
so I could claw my way back to life.

296
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:39,940
Grandmaster, my life is yours.

297
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,722
I'll follow you to thedeath!

298
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:58,140
Since you're human now, you should learn to live like one.

299
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,970
Tingyan said the same.

300
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,680
She told me not to lick her fingers.

301
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:07,180
She also told me to learn self-respect and self-love like a person.

302
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:11,740
But, Grandmaster, I don't know how to be human.

303
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,100
You went to see her first?

304
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,690
Without Tingyan,

305
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:19,020
Ruling wouldn't have returned my heart.

306
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,780
I went to thank Tingyan!

307
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:26,130
Grandmaster, Tingyan's a true friend.

308
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,690
A true friend?

309
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:34,040
She's really good at winning people over.

310
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:38,680
Tomorrow night, also new moon night, guard the mountain gate.

311
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,450
Yes, Grandmaster.

312
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:01,230
Senior Aunt, do you wait here every day?

313
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:05,870
Why do you want to see the Grandmaster so badly?

314
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,160
The Grandmaster sustains the Spirit Fire alone,

315
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,070
letting all of Gengchen Celestial Palace enjoy endless spiritual energy.

316
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:14,410
Gaining his favor has been my dream since childhood,

317
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:16,780
and the glory of Heaven Palace.

318
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:19,070
But he's unpredictable.

319
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,820
Aren't you afraid he'll kill you?

320
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:24,940
Even if he does, I'll have no regrets.

321
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:37,390
Are all cultivators this ready to die?

322
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:39,750
I can't do that.

323
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,440
Being alive is great.

324
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,580
Why die for someone else?

325
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,840
If there's a chance to live,

326
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,050
I'll fight for it no matter what.

327
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:08,540
Boss, don't scare me so early in the morning.

328
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:12,150
How can you be so timid?

329
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,550
So, you'd better not pile too much work on me,

330
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:19,300
or if I get hurt at work, you'll be responsible.

331
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,550
- Such a hassle, right? 
 - Want me to take responsibility for you?

332
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,830
You've got some ambition.

333
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:29,730
Grandmaster, you sure know what to focus on.

334
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,230
What kind of spell is this?

335
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:38,580
You used this trick to win over that dumb snake?

336
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:41,103
That's a false accusation!

337
00:30:41,103 --> 00:30:44,110
I can't use spells. You know that.

338
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:53,820
Then tell me, what is this spell?

339
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,510
It's a thumbs-up gesture.

340
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:58,060
What's a "thumbs-up"?

341
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,930
It's kissing up to you,

342
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:02,810
buttering you up, and flattering you.

343
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:06,020
Such petty tricks are utterly beneath me.

344
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:08,030
 But you seemed to enjoy it. 

345
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:13,170
Too bad, I don't want kisses, and I don't care about "butter".

346
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:15,660
Your little scheme has failed.

347
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,290
I...

348
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,070
Stop right there.

349
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,880
How's your practice with the spell

350
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,000
I taught you last time?

351
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,070
So-so, I guess.

352
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,820
Grandmaster, what are you doing?

353
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,850
Remember, when you kill someone,

354
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:34,090
it's best to stab here.

355
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,860
Or at least...

356
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:46,100
stabbing here works, too.

357
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,090
Learned it?

358
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:57,580
Yes. Thank you for the lesson.

359
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:11,340
Well then...

360
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:14,720
I'll go water the little flame now.

361
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:43,360
Everyone, please stay calm.

362
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,330
Don't disturb the Grandmaster.

363
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:51,550
We agreed to wait and observe the spirit vein.

364
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:56,500
Yet, some came early, hoping to strike while he was weak.

365
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,450
Master Tian, you really can't stand evil.

366
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:01,650
So, what are you here for?

367
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:04,060
Naturally, to protect the Grandmaster.

368
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,200
Protect him?

369
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:10,140
That's the official line, but in truth,

370
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,630
who here isn't eyeing him?

371
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:16,920
Some want to snatch the Blood Clot Flower while he's weak.

372
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:22,590
Others want to take credit and win his favor.

373
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,340
That's the best-case scenario.

374
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:28,300
The worst are those who fear he'll settle old scores

375
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,890
and try to strike first to kill him.

376
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:33,770
Madam Yue!

377
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,280
Don't sling mud!

378
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,070
We all rely on him to cultivate.

379
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,630
Who'd want to harm him?

380
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,070
Who knows?

381
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:44,190
There are always a few who don't care about the big picture.

382
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:46,670
- Hey! 
 - Both of you.

383
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:50,190
Please, calm yourselves.

384
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:54,360
Whatever the case, we all want the Grandmaster safe

385
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:58,440
to keep the spirit vein alive.

386
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,930
I'm here not to stand in anyone's way.

387
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:06,070
Just asking you to know your limits.

388
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,490
Please, go ahead.

389
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:09,410
I still think something's off.

390
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:12,530
What if An Xue's message is fake,

391
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:15,140
and the Grandmaster lures us in to kill us?

392
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,530
No risk, no reward.

393
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:20,820
With no courage at all, how will you get the Blood Clot Flower?

394
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,440
Madam Xing's concern isn't unfounded.

395
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,800
I propose,

396
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,470
since it was my palace's An Xue who sent the news,

397
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,760
my palace should handle this matter.

398
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,280
I'll send elders inside to guard the Grandmaster.

399
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,190
- How about it? 
 - You're just trying to rush in.

400
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:39,030
And then, you'll take all the Blood Clot Flower, won't you?

401
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:41,520
Then I'll leave it to you, Master Yin.

402
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:39,030
So, that's how Blood Clot Flower grows.

403
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:52,450
Did you eat the petals I gave you?

404
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:54,260
No.

405
00:36:56,990 --> 00:37:00,150
The Blood Clot Flower only works with my blood.

406
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,680
Otherwise, it'll blow you into a mist of blood.

407
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:07,240
You've drunk my blood, so don't worry.

408
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:12,560
It's too precious. I can't bear to use it.

409
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,590
Why not eat it?

410
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:22,930
A cup of coffee only gives you an extra hour of energy.

411
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:25,630
But one petal gives a thousand years of cultivation.

412
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,320
I'm afraid it might kill me.

413
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,630
What if I insist you eat it?

414
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,820
Then I still won't.

415
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:33,170
I'll take a gamble. See if you'll kill me for it.

416
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:38,980
 How could I even say things like that out loud? 

417
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,440
Fine, have it your way.

418
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:51,280
What's with you today, Grandmaster?

419
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,580
You think I'm easy to deal with today?

420
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,990
Guess why.

421
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,850
Because...

422
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,900
I'm going to be killed?

423
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,200
The one getting killed...

424
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,820
isn't you.

425
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:18,400
   

426
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:26,180
You think you can kill me?

427
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,730
What are you waiting? Altogether, kill him!

428
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,840
How can this be?

429
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,360
The new moon hasn't affected you

430
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,360
or weakened you at all!

431
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:58,400
Boss, you're really okay?

432
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:04,590
If I get hurt, will you want to kill me like they do?

433
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,710
You're wrong.

434
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:16,840
I am badly hurt.

435
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,510
Today is truly my weakest day.

436
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:24,630
If you want to kill me, this is indeed a golden chance.

437
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,420
However...

438
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,060
Even in this state, to me...

439
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,720
you are still too weak.

440
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,340
Boss.

441
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,070
You've got blood on your lips

442
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:14,610
when you say those cool lines.

443
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,370
Liao Tingyan.

444
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:22,260
I'm badly hurt right now.

445
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:27,050
This is a good chance for you.

446
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:37,230
Got it!

447
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:49,440
It's a perfect chance to suck up to you.

448
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,500
Boss, satisfied now?

449
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:00,530
That lady...

450
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,660
Sima Jiao can't fight back anymore.

451
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,780
Take the sword and kill him!

452
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,400
I don't kill people.

453
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,820
If he lives, you die!

454
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:11,180
And more will die later!

455
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,360
Hurry, do it!

456
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,600
He's right.

457
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,500
Go ahead.

458
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:26,480
Pull the sword out.

459
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:31,110
Grandmaster, what do you want with the sword?

460
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:46,960
Do you remember how I taught you to kill?

461
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:59,950


462
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:22,530

00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,740
♫  Be it right or wrong  ♫

490
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,620
♫  Rumor or legend  ♫

491
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:42,180
♫  With fate in my hands  ♫

492
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:46,080
♫  I seize it  ♫

493
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:48,740
♫  For you  ♫

494
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:50,620
♫  For me  ♫

495
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:54,660
♫  For the healing of wounds  ♫

496
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,680
♫  I fight  ♫

497
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,620
♫  the murky sea and Heaven  ♫

498
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:02,760
♫  To complete this vastness  ♫

499
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,740
♫  For you  ♫

500
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,720
♫  For me  ♫

501
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,680
♫  For the first rays of morning sun to shine through  ♫

502
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,700
♫  To face my promises  ♫

503
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,720
♫  Like a moth attracted by a flame  ♫

504
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:26,839
♫  I use my body to shine even more  ♫
