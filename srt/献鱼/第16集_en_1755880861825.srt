1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The wind and the moon are the same.

2
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
But between us, love can be exchanged.

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Who loves me is not fated.

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The time that is hot and cold in this life.

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Even if this life is endless and I can't live it,

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I still want to be with you.

7
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The entangled city, the eternal life, I won't return.

8
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The entangled city, the eternal life, I won't return.

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's just like that.

10
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Touch it.

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Wow.

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's a fish.

13
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You're too lazy.

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You like to touch fish, but you want others to catch you.

15
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This lake is called the sky and the sky is clear.

16
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This is the flying fish.

17
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The food they eat is made of the purest materials.

18
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The food they eat is made of the purest materials.

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It will be a chocolate.

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's so precious. I can't touch it.

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Let's put it back.

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But I heard that the ice blue fish can make you beautiful.

23
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Then I have to touch it.

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
After you touch it, the fish can be grilled and eaten.

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Isn't it good to touch fish in other people's land?

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But if you support me...

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Isn't this fish too little?

28
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's rare for me to cook.

29
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I have to arrange the dishes.

30
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Hey!

31
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
How can you catch those fish?

32
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
This is called touching fish.

33
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You don't do anything.

34
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I don't do anything anyway.

35
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The best man in the world is the one who can catch so many fish.

36
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I like it and admire it.

37
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The man who can catch fish is so handsome.

38
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
He makes me feel safe.

39
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
He catches the best.

40
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Stop talking nonsense.

41
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Thank you for coming. I'll wipe your sweat.

42
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's no big deal. You don't have to wipe my sweat.

43
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Come on.

44
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Sit down.

45
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Don't grill all these fish.

46
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Make me a soup.

47
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You want to eat it?

48
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You want to eat it?

49
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I caught the fish myself. I can't eat it.

50
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yes, you can.

51
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What makes an ancestor who doesn't like to eat anything

52
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
want to eat it?

53
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Is it the fish that can make you beautiful and have good health?

54
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Or is it my salty fish?

55
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You're talking nonsense.

56
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's delicious.

57
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
No.

58
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The true beauty of the immortal world.

59
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
How can there be such delicious fish?

60
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Crispy on the outside, soft and tender on the inside.

61
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's fresh and fragrant.

62
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Is your soup delicious?

63
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You taste it.

64
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'll try it.

65
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'll try it.

66
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'll try it.

67
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You taste it.

68
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's delicious. My tongue is going to fall off.

69
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Delicious.

70
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It should be on the tongue.

71
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It can make the ancestors who don't like to eat anything feel delicious.

72
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It turns out that the ingredients here are really good.

73
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I can make it so delicious.

74
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm going to go out tomorrow.

75
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
In other words,

76
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm going to get a job.

77
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
This trip will take some time.

78
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
If you have any thoughts,

79
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
tell me anytime.

80
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Don't worry.

81
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I still have the fluorescent mirror you gave me.

82
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You can go to get a job.

83
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Sima Jiao is in the dark.

84
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And we are in the bright.

85
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's not easy to find him.

86
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Boss.

87
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The fish in the Cloud Mirror Lake you like the most

88
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
has been stolen by someone.

89
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Really?

90
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Who did this?

91
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The thief. He's staying in the lake.

92
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I...

93
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
This is the trace of Ting Yan's body.

94
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It seems that his cultivation is one level closer to the past.

95
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
My fish.

96
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I...

97
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Our Geng Chen Xian Mansion is getting more and more chaotic.

98
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Boss.

99
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Your fish in the Cloud Mirror Lake

100
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
can't bear to catch it.

101
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I rarely see you share it with us.

102
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
This is good.

103
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You were stolen by a nameless thief.

104
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You are so obedient.

105
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Who?

106
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Sima Jiao?

107
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Sima Jiao doesn't take good care of herself.

108
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
She came to steal fish under your nose?

109
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Our eight great masters are trying their best to find her.

110
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
If she really did it,

111
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
then this confidence

112
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
is a little too big.

113
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
That's right.

114
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
The fish in the Cloud Mirror Lake

115
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
doesn't have much effect on health.

116
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
If Sima Jiao's brain is clear,

117
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
she won't risk her life

118
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
to come to you to catch fish.

119
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
With her personality,

120
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
it's hard to say.

121
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
If Sima Jiao went to the Cloud Mirror Lake

122
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
for the sake of Ting Yan,

123
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
then it makes sense.

124
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Someone!

125
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Young Princess.

126
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Why didn't you send someone in today?

127
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Young Princess,

128
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
the secretaries of the Yans

129
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
have been reinforced.

130
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm afraid it's hard to choose

131
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
the female disciple you asked for.

132
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You know I practice martial arts

133
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and exhaust my primordial spirit.

134
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Why didn't you prepare it earlier?

135
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Young Princess, please calm down.

136
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Didn't you just get the elixir recently?

137
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You should be the most nourished.

138
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Young Princess, please spare me.

139
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Please spare me.

140
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Chu Hui.

141
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Mother.

142
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Chu Hui.

143
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Where did you find the evil demon magic?

144
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Mother.

145
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I finally found it.

146
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Otherwise,

147
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
without the master's reward,

148
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
how could I have been

149
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
able to enter the God of Painting?

150
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
But Young Princess,

151
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
you know

152
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
the way to the capital

153
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
will hurt you.

154
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That's why I need to find

155
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
these disciples to make progress.

156
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Mother, don't worry.

157
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The disciples I found

158
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
are all blind disciples.

159
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Even if they die,

160
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
no one will notice.

161
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
How would I know?

162
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I heard the rumor recently

163
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
that you were absorbing

164
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
the cultivation of the female disciple.

165
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm afraid that soon,

166
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
her palace gates will also find you.

167
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm the daughter of the master of the palace.

168
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I actually practiced the evil demon magic.

169
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
How could I be able to help you?

170
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
But mother,

171
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
you're the master of the palace.

172
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What can you do

173
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
if someone else finds out?

174
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You can't let me

175
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
leave in the middle of the night.

176
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Princess,

177
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
why don't you

178
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
go to the Luohe Fairy's House

179
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
to have a look?

180
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
First, to have a look.

181
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Second,

182
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
it's far away from here.

183
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's all the outside families.

184
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
If anything happens,

185
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
you can't come to the Fairy's House.

186
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Luohe Fairy's House?

187
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's so far away?

188
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It makes sense.

189
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's settled then.

190
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
If something happens

191
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
to the inner palace,

192
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
you can escape

193
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
as well.

194
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Mother,

195
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
what disaster can happen?

196
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I don't want to go

197
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
to such a far place.

198
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's settled then.

199
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You should leave early.

200
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Mother.

201
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I don't know why,

202
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
but I feel so bored today.

203
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Bored?

204
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Bored?

205
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
How about

206
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
going out to buy some books?

207
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Let's go out.

208
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
We have enough snacks and budget.

209
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
We must come back with full price.

210
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Yes, Miss.

211
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Miss,

212
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
the Yunyi Embroidery said

213
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
that the things you ordered

214
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
a few days ago

215
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
are ready.

216
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Shall we go there

217
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
and have a look?

218
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's so fast.

219
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Let's go to the Yunyi Embroidery first.

220
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Miss and Young Master

221
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
are so close.

222
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I made a magic instrument for her.

223
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It's so embarrassing

224
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
to say that she didn't return the gift.

225
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Let's go.

226
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Miss Yong,

227
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
it's been a long time.

228
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Please come in.

229
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Come on.

230
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Please sit.

231
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Miss,

232
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
enjoy your meal.

233
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Miss Yong,

234
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
as you ordered,

235
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
the magic instrument

236
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
is ready.

237
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's well-made.

238
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's the most famous shop

239
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
in Luohe County.

240
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Miss,

241
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
except jewelry,

242
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
clothes and clothes,

243
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
we also have the best quality.

244
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
There are new cloths

245
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
in the shop today.

246
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You've come here.

247
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
How about

248
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
showing them to you?

249
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Wait a moment.

250
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Miss Yong,

251
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
please have a look at this flower bud.

252
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
The pattern of this flower bud

253
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
is not ordinary.

254
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
This flower is called

255
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Sun Moon Lake.

256
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's amazing.

257
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
The most famous

258
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Si Ma Clan in the Immortal's Mansion,

259
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I think you should know that

260
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Sun Moon Lake

261
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
is the half-life flower of those masters.

262
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Few people have seen

263
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
the real face of this flower.

264
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And this pattern

265
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
is only found in our Yunyi Embroidery.

266
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
The shape of this flower

267
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
doesn't seem to be right.

268
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
The material is really beautiful.

269
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Miss Yong,

270
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
have you seen Sun Moon Lake?

271
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
The rare and famous flower

272
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
of Sun Moon Lake,

273
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
how can I see it

274
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
in a normal person like me?

275
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I mean,

276
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
the pattern of this flower

277
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
is quite new.

278
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
This flower is always hard to find.

279
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
In our Yunyi Embroidery,

280
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
we only get 17 pieces every year.

281
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
We never make any effort.

282
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Since you are so

283
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
hardworking,

284
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'll take all of these.

285
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Okay, wait a minute.

286
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Duanhua Ji.

287
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Miss Yong,

288
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm really sorry.

289
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Sun Moon Lake

290
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
is already booked by other customers.

291
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I was careless just now.

292
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I didn't know about this.

293
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Well,

294
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
to apologize,

295
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
you can choose

296
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
20 pieces of new cloths.

297
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'll treat them as a gift for you.

298
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I wonder what you think.

299
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I think

300
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
someone deliberately

301
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
stole things from our lady.

302
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You are so stingy.

303
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
That's why you want to

304
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
disturb us like this.

305
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
That's right.

306
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Do you know

307
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
our lady

308
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
was born in the Yong family of Yeyou Palace?

309
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
She is the daughter of Mu's family.

310
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
She is the granddaughter

311
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
of Mu's family's

312
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
old master.

313
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Our lady was in a bad mood today.

314
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You are

315
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
going to be in trouble.

316
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Right, my lady?

317
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm not in a bad mood.

318
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I was standing here

319
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
and was fooled by you.

320
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm like a vicious woman.

321
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm just being impolite.

322
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
A Yeyou Palace

323
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
does have a master.

324
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Princess.

325
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Today,

326
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
even if the Princess of Yeyou Palace

327
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
and the old master of Mu's family

328
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
come here in person,

329
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
they will only kneel

330
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
and kowtow to me.

331
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Yes.

332
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm the daughter of the Princess of Yeyou Palace.

333
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It's called coming first and then coming later.

334
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
How can we

335
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
let things out?

336
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Everyone has always

337
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
followed my order.

338
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I like

339
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
this material of the Yeyou Palace.

340
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Don't try to take it away.

341
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
We are in a lot of trouble.

342
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
We can't avoid the loss.

343
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It's better to leave first.

344
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Since you like it,

345
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'll give it to you.

346
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Let's go.

347
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Did I tell you to leave?

348
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You have

349
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
a smell that makes me feel like I know you.

350
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It's very annoying.

351
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You look weak.

352
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
But in fact,

353
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
you don't even care about anyone.

354
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I...

355
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
We haven't met before.

356
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
You must have mistaken me.

357
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I told you to talk.

358
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
How dare you fight back?

359
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Teach him a lesson.

360
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Don't bully too much.

361
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Don't kill him.

362
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
He looks like

363
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
a god of painting.

364
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You're not worth your breath.

365
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I hate your face.

366
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You're a god of painting.

367
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Since it's so useless,

368
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
then give me

369
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
your cultivation skills.

370
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Don't be so grumpy.

371
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Don't make things hard for me.

372
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
If I don't do well,

373
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I'll kill you.

374
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I'll kill you.

375
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'll kill you.

376
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'll kill you.

377
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'll kill you.

378
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'll kill you.

379
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'll kill you.

380
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'll kill you.

381
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I'll kill you.

382
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I'll kill you.

383
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'll kill you.

384
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'll kill you.

385
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
If I don't do well,

386
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
you'll be in danger.

387
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You're kidding.

388
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm a god of defense.

389
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You're a god of painting.

390
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Why should I be a god of defense?

391
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
What kind of evil skill is this?

392
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You can hurt me?

393
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
What kind of evil skill is this?

394
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I didn't mean to

395
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
break your defense skill.

396
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You didn't mean to.

397
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Why are you so crazy?

398
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Why are you so crazy?

399
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Why are you so crazy?

400
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Han Dao Jun, Jiang Feng Dao Jun,

401
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
show him some respect.

402
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Break his bones.

403
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
But don't kill him.

404
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Wait until I've had enough fun,

405
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
then come back to kill him.

406
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Princess Ye.

407
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Are you going to give Princess Yue medicine?

408
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Replying to Princess Ye,

409
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Young Princess was injured yesterday.

410
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It looks like

411
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
it's just a small wound

412
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
that can be healed immediately.

413
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
But I don't know why,

414
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
the medicine that can heal the wound

415
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
is useless.

416
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
That's why I asked the mayor

417
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
to give some medicine that's rare.

418
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Unusual wound?

419
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
But Young Princess had a fight with someone else.

420
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Yes.

421
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
That girl is still locked

422
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
in the palace by Young Princess.

423
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Can you show me her?

424
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Yes.

425
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Who is she?

426
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
She said she was

427
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
the young lady of Ye You Palace.

428
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
She has the special power

429
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
that the body of the Great Han brought.

430
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Since Sima Jiao

431
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
can turn Ting Yan into a water tower,

432
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
it's not impossible

433
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
to turn her into another person.

434
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
When you caught her,

435
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
she was the only one?

436
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Yes.

437
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
There were no other people

438
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
besides some little guards

439
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
and maids around her.

440
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
This is a wound by a high-level technique.

441
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Ordinary techniques

442
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
can't heal it.

443
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
The external wound is fine.

444
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
But why is the internal wound so serious?

445
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It's really too much.

446
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I need to take Ting Yan back to the palace

447
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
to heal her.

448
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
But Ting Yan is here

449
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
to catch Sima Jiao.

450
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I can't let her go.

451
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I can't let her go.

452
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I can't let her go.

453
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I can't let her go.

454
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I can't let her go.

455
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I can't let her go.

456
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I can't let her go.

457
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I can't let her go.

458
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I can't let her go.

459
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
This is the best time to catch Sima Jiao.

460
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Let's go.

461
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Is that woman really going to catch Ting Yan?

462
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Yes.

463
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
If the captain can ambush her in advance,

464
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
she will definitely lure Sima Jiao.

465
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Send the message to all the palace gates immediately.

466
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Set out immediately.

467
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
We rushed here as soon as we got the news.

468
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Is there any news about Sima Jiao's whereabouts?

469
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Princesses,

470
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Sima Jiao is now in danger.

471
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Her power is much worse than before.

472
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
To capture Sima Jiao,

473
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
we must do it today.

474
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
You are using me

475
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
as a bait for your life.

476
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
How can you guarantee her safety?

477
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Princess Yue,

478
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
with Sima Jiao's current condition,

479
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
even if I can't defeat her,

480
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I can at least fight with her.

481
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
It's enough for us to complete the seal

482
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
and save your daughter.

483
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Princess Yue,

484
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
why don't you learn from your mistakes?

485
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
After you succeed,

486
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
you will be the leader of the eight palaces.

487
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Then why are you still standing there?

488
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I...

489
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
If I don't go,

490
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I will die.

491
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Set out!

492
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Ting Yan.

493
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Ting Yan.

494
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Liao Ting Yan is in danger.

495
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Eight palaces are moving.

496
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
The purple flow is the mountain.

497
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Grand Master,

498
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
let me go with you.

499
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
You haven't fully recovered from your injuries.

500
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I will be by your side.

501
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
You should take care of her.

502
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
This is a trap in the world.

503
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Think about it carefully.

504
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Ting Yan is my good friend.

505
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
You are my master.

506
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I will go with you to save Ting Yan.

507
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I will die if I don't drink.

508
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Why are you standing there?

509
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Young Princess,

510
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
the clothes are ready.

511
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Please try it on.

512
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
What's the good thing?

513
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
But the clothes...

514
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Your power...

515
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Without those disciples,

516
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
my power has really increased a lot.

517
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Where is the girl I caught

518
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
the other day?

519
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Yes.

520
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
She is still locked up.

521
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Tell Han Dao Jun to bring her here.

522
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Ting Yan.

523
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Ting Yan.

524
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Ting Yan.

525
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Ting Yan.

526
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Does it hurt?

527
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
It's still fragrant.

528
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
You are lying.

529
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I don't feel well.

530
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
It's so hot.

531
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
You finally came to save me.

532
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
The city is dark.

533
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Let love be forgotten.

534
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
The old city is covered with fog.

535
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
If their cultivation is lower than mine,

536
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I will try my best.

537
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
But there are several immortals.

538
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I am also the least self-sacrificing.

539
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I cut off the growth of love.

540
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Fate is unpredictable.

541
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
How can it be longer and longer?

542
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I thought it was nothing.

543
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
But when I saw you,

544
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I felt uncomfortable.

545
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Talk to me.

546
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Talk to me.

547
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I won't feel uncomfortable.

548
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
It's not uncomfortable.

549
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
It hurts.

550
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
It hurts.

551
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Only because of love.

552
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Why do I have to go through all the pain?

553
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
It hurts to say that I am not crazy.

554
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Okay.

555
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I don't hurt anymore.

556
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I am not crazy.

557
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Then I will give happiness.

558
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I will give happiness.

559
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I just hope this memory can be released.

560
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Don't be in the same dream.

561
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Where are we going?

562
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Are we going to kill someone?

563
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
What if?

564
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Yue Chu Hui is the young princess of Yue Zhi Palace.

565
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
You will be discovered.

566
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Zi Liu Manor is ahead.

567
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
My son is there.

568
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Isn't it just a Yong Lin Chun?

569
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Such a big scene.

570
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
How dare you!

571
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Who agreed to come in?

572
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Han Dao Jun.

573
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Jiang Feng Dao Jun.

574
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I don't care who you are.

575
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
My guards will be back soon.

576
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
By that time,

577
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
none of you can leave.

578
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Grand... Grand Master.

579
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Liu Tian Yan.

580
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Grand Master.

581
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Grand Master, don't come over.

582
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
My mother will come to save me soon.

583
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
They are here.

584
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
My mother's life of being young to elite,

585
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
is everyday's hand in the details.

586
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I have in my heart,

587
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
the life of a lifeAt the Restaurant.

588
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Proof.

589
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Wei...

590
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Mother, help me!

591
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Sima Jiao.

592
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,200
Send my daughter here!

593
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,840
Master, they're taking the seal.

594
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,240
We're surrounded.

595
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,240
I see.

596
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,320
Princess Yue, don't worry.

597
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,680
Don't forget.

598
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,280
Our priority

599
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,520
is to seal Sima Jiao.

600
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,000
You do it.

601
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,400
Peel her skin.

602
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,920
Kill her.

603
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,360
No.

604
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,840
No.

605
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,640
No.

606
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,040
No.

607
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,240
No.

608
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,440
No.

609
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,240
If someone bullies you,

610
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,120
and hurts you,

611
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,880
you'll take revenge.

612
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,840
If she hurts your face,

613
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,360
you peel her skin.

614
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,240
If she hits you,

615
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,440
you break every bone on her body.

616
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,600
If she hurts you,

617
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,400
you'll die of pain.

618
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,120
Master, I'm sorry.

619
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,720
Please forgive me.

620
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,320
Kill her.

621
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,600
Sima Jiao!

622
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,280
Gather all the eight dogs.

623
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,840
If you let my daughter go,

624
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,520
you can kill them all.

625
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,240
If anything happens to my daughter,

626
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,520
I'll kill you.

627
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,720
You're noisy.

628
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:41,880
Kill...

629
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:43,720
Uncle.

630
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,040
I have a stomachache.

631
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,240
It's nothing serious.

632
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,280
Let's go back first.

633
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,400
Okay?

634
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,040
No.

635
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,680
I've suffered a severe internal injury.

636
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,160
If you don't save me, I'll die.

637
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,760
I'm afraid of pain.

638
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,320
I beg you, my ancestors.

639
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,120
Are you sure you don't want to do it yourself?

640
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,880
I didn't pretend to be with you.

641
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,160
Let's go back first.

642
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,880
Let's go back first.

643
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,800
Okay?

644
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,600
Okay.

645
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,040
If you don't kill me,

646
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,200
I'll follow your order.

647
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,400
The eight masters

648
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,200
are going to fight for the truth today.

649
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,440
You haven't recovered from your injury.

650
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,320
Let's use the first month to be our bargaining chip.

651
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,640
Let's leave here first.

652
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,360
I can follow your order.

653
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,720
But this person

654
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,240
must pay the price.

655
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,880
No.

656
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,160
Master.

657
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,000
No.

658
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,280
Qiuhui.

659
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,040
Qiuhui.

660
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,280
Princess Yue.

661
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,800
You have to be strong.

662
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,600
Didn't you say you could save him?

663
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,440
Didn't you say you could save him?

664
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,960
I should have run over there

665
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,440
instead of being here

666
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,080
waiting for you.

667
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,720
What's the use of running over there alone?

668
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,080
Can you have a chance?

669
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,480
Your daughter was just exhausted.

670
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,040
At least her life is saved.

671
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,320
Princess Yue.

672
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,240
Don't be distracted.

673
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,480
Cheer up.

674
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,720
Today I will take your lives

675
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,000
and atone for my daughter.

676
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,200
Do you think you can

677
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,000
trap me for long?

678
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,400
Si Ma Jiao.

679
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,960
If you could break my formation,

680
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,200
you would have come out earlier.

681
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,880
After the battle at Baifeng Mountain,

682
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,080
you haven't recovered from your injury.

683
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,400
Am I right?

684
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,520
I haven't recovered from my injury.

685
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,240
You can come to me

686
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,200
and try to know.

687
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:12,880
Now...

688
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,640
might not hope

689
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,960
Ru Ling, if you insist on doing this,

690
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,160
how can we still be friends in the future?

691
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,840
Since I decided to kill Sima Jiao,

692
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,960
I knew this day would come.

693
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,600
Our friendship for so many days,

694
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,880
is it so broken?

695
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:02,800
Yes.

696
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,520
Liao Ting Yan, Black Nine,

697
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,920
see you next time.

698
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,880
I won't be easy on you

699
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,440
when we meet again.

700
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,320
Sima Jiao.

701
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:30,320
You haven't recovered yet.

702
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,560
You're really strong.

703
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,720
Even if you're badly injured,

704
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,840
you can still fight with me for so long.

705
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,440
Sima Jiao.

706
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,480
Sima Jiao.

707
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,280
Sima Jiao.

708
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,120
Sima Jiao.

709
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,960
Sima Jiao.

710
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,880
Sima Jiao.

711
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,880
Sima Jiao.

712
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,480
I've been waiting for this moment.

713
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,760
How could this happen?

714
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,080
Could it be that someone in the palace

715
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,320
helped her?

716
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,320
Chu Hui.

717
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,640
Chu Hui.

718
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,160
Lady Xie of the Fourth Prince.

719
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,000
I're here.

720
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:51,960
Princess Ye.

721
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,760
I just saw you and the swan

722
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,120
being плоit-stricken.

723
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,240
What were youδήving each other?

724
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,080
TheykemHI me'm spending our time away from Sima Jiao.

725
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,840
But I didn't agree.

726
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,600
Did the brushmaster doubt me?

727
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:10,840
Normally,

728
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,240
The banana is good.

729
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,280
And it has a good relationship with the black snake.

730
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,560
Princess Ye, don't blame me for being suspicious.

731
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,360
You're worried too much.

732
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,840
Sit down.

733
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,040
How is it?

734
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,520
It's fine.

735
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,000
It's just a small wound.

736
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
You haven't recovered yet.

737
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,600
How did you break through the seal?

738
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,560
When I was in the small ward,

739
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,120
you told me

740
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,320
that someone in the eight palaces needed to help you.

741
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,240
That's why you agreed to let me persuade him.

742
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,720
I'm sorry.

743
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,120
I didn't mean to hurt you.

744
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,320
I was just worried.

745
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,320
I'm sorry.

746
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,680
You asked me to persuade Ru Ling, didn't you?

747
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,000
Ye Ru Ling is just a lie.

748
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,600
The one who really helped me is Yuan Che.

749
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,240
What if he betrays you

750
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,080
or can't help me?

751
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,520
It would be more dangerous.

752
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,320
There's no such thing as a coincidence.

753
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,480
I knew that the dragon was playing tricks on me.

754
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,120
I couldn't defeat them.

755
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,560
And they even risked their lives for me.

756
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,320
I'm sorry.

757
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,400
I'm sorry.

758
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,360
Who said I couldn't defeat them?

759
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,000
You did.

760
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,360
I didn't expect that you've learned to cooperate with others.

761
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,360
He helped me.

762
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,360
It's his duty.

763
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,440
How can I cooperate with him?

764
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,880
You'll learn to ask others to help you in the future.

765
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,720
Now that Yuan Che is here,

766
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,320
why did you ask me to persuade Ru Ling

767
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,760
and make such a big deal out of it?

768
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,480
In order to avoid suspicion,

769
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,360
I need to find someone who is in the same group

770
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,560
and make a big deal out of it.

771
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,480
So Ru Ling is Yuan Che's shield.

772
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,080
He's my friend.

773
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,280
I forgot that

774
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,680
we're not friends anymore.

775
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,320
You lost a friend you didn't mean to be with.

776
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,840
Why are you so worried?

777
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,080
You didn't make friends.

778
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,960
Of course you wouldn't be in this mood.

779
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,600
You're angry with me?

780
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,320
I'm sorry.

781
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,520
I don't know what's wrong with me recently.

782
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,960
I'm always bored.

783
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,600
I'm always bored.

784
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,720
Ru Ling is even more boring.

785
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,600
I'm so bored that my chest is so stuffy

786
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,400
that it's like I'm having a stomachache.

787
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,440
You've been bored lately?

788
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,280
I don't know why.

789
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,840
I'm so bored that I can't get a good start.

790
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,800
Shouerna닥

791
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,600
Shootilong

792
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,400
If I find you Arcania Bowling Yoge

793
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,480
I surely will start to learn it.

794
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,640
You don't need to be angry with me.

795
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:51,920
No.

796
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,600
I want to learn first.

797
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,720
Then we'll be closer.

798
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,840
Lu Ling, stop it.

799
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,120
Lu Ling, if that's what you've decided,

800
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,860
how will we be friends in the future?

801
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,320
Why, are you vacationing too?

802
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,260
Are you a fish emo as I am?

803
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,560
You look down on me.

804
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,180
You deserve a famed from my abynd Bless.

805
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,580
We'll be sisters from now on.

806
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:22,700
Okay.

807
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,020
Our friendship for so many days

808
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,700
has been broken off like this?

809
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,420
Yes.

810
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,940
Your eyes

811
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,300
are shining.

812
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:42,940
They're so beautiful.

813
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,380
I'm a snake.

814
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,180
You gave me the chance to turn into a human heart.

815
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,260
You gave me my life.

816
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,220
If you want to take it away today,

817
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:56,660
I'll give it to you.

818
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:00,540
Master,

819
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,180
take this as a gift from me.

820
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,540
If I call you by death...

821
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:06,980
If you need it,

822
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,660
I can be by your side at any time.

823
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,420
ו

824
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,560
YouTube

825
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,180
I'm sorry.

826
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,180
I'm the one who failed you.

827
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,580
I'm not only living for myself,

828
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,580
I have to bring my people back to the old land.

829
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,180
I'm sorry

830
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,780
for disappointing you.

831
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,180
I'm sorry.

832
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:52,180
The autumn breeze is light and the stars and the moon are half broken.

833
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:56,180
It's all dyed with the deep loneliness.

834
00:42:56,180 --> 00:43:00,180
The candlelight is weak and the shadow is shattering.

835
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:04,180
Shimmering in the dark night.

836
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:08,180
I used my brush to outline the colors of light

837
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:12,180
to warm your cold soul.

838
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:16,180
The memory is clear and the longing is clear.

839
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:19,180
But I can't touch it.

840
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,520
The sand is buried in the

841
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:24,180
sand.

842
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:27,180
The flowers are still in full bloom.

843
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:34,180
Burn out all the fireflies.

844
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:40,180
I'm waiting for you to come back.

845
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:44,180
I'm not alone.

846
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:48,180
I'll follow the rules and go through the whirlpools.

847
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:52,180
What's the matter with life and death?

848
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:56,180
I'll only read your name and mine.

849
00:43:56,180 --> 00:44:00,180
I'll only read the result for the whole life.

850
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,180
Right or wrong,

851
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:04,180
Rumors spread.

852
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:11,180
I'll never let go of my destiny.

853
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:16,180
For you, for me,

854
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:20,180
for the balance of the wound,

855
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:24,180
the sea is warm and the rain is soft.

856
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:28,180
It's me who is withered.

857
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:32,180
For you, for me,

858
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:36,180
for the sincerity of confession,

859
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:40,180
I'll face the promise, as if flying.

860
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:50,180
I'll light up the world with my body.
