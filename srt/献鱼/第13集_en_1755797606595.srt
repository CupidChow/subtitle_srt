00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,600
Episode 16

4
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,600
We don't have time to deal with this now.

5
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,600
The best way to save the world is to take advantage of his injury

6
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,600
and capture him.

7
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,600
Remember,

8
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,600
to keep him alive.

9
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,600
Immortal Deity.

10
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,600
The Immortal Deity Lü.

11
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,600
You've been preparing for hundreds of years.

12
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,600
You've put in a lot of effort to get the Mount Baifeng.

13
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,600
Just to hold the Immortal Deity Lü in your hands.

14
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,600
You don't need to be held by the Sima clan anymore.

15
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,600
When this is about to succeed,

16
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,600
you can't just give up.

17
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
You have to be more careful.

18
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,600
I'm not afraid of you.

19
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,600
I'm not afraid of you.

20
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,600
I'm not afraid of you.

21
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,600
I'm not afraid of you.

22
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,600
I'm not afraid of you.

23
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
I'm not afraid of you.

24
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,600
Wei Yi Kui.

25
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,600
Are you happy?

26
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Master.

27
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,600
Is the Mount Baifeng really what you did?

28
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Don't believe him.

29
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,600
He's lying.

30
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
Sima Qiao.

31
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,600
I thought you were a good person.

32
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,600
I've been protecting you everywhere.

33
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,600
I didn't expect you to be so cruel.

34
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,600
Then don't blame the disciples.

35
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,600
I can't protect you anymore.

36
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,600
Guys.

37
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Don't listen to him.

38
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Yes.

39
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,600
He wants us to be the immortal deities.

40
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
And die with him.

41
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
If he completely destroys the spirit,

42
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,600
that would be the worst.

43
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,600
Want my life?

44
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,600
You're so obsessed with it.

45
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,600
You can't even think of me.

46
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,600
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,600
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,600
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,600
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,600
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,600
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,600
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,600
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,600
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,600
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,600
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,600
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,600
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,600
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,600
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,600
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,600
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,600
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,600
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,600
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,600
I'm sorry.

70
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,600
I'm sorry.

71
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,600
I'm sorry.

72
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,600
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,600
I am sorry.

75
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Immortal Deity?

76
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
You indeed became Great Cheng.

77
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,600
No wonder you kept doing flight and acquaintance activities in Bai Peng Mountain.

78
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,600
Let me guess where do you IBF

79
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,600
and Using Sima Stone,

80
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,600
Don't you dare lie to me again!

81
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
If I stay here with you,

82
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,600
and don't leave any blood of Fengshan for you,

83
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,600
you don't have to dream about your Spring and Autumn anymore!

84
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,720

89
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,600
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

90
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
If you're weak,

91
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,600
you'll be the only one I have.

92
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,600
How about you?

93
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,600
Ma Jiao, you...

94
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,600
He seems to be really a wild boar.

95
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,600
His body is about to collapse.

96
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,600
You're afraid.

97
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,600
What you should be afraid of

98
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,600
is the things on the other side.

99
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,600
Si Ma Jiao,

100
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
if you're really in pain,

101
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,600
forget it.

102
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,600
You're going to die anyway.

103
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,600
You don't have to extend your time of pain

104
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,600
for them.

105
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,600
I'll explain it to you here today.

106
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,600
But it's been so long.

107
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,600
I'm quite late.

108
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,600
I don't know what happened to you.

109
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,600
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

110
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,600
If you're really in pain,

111
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,600
forget it.

112
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,600
You're going to die anyway.

113
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,600
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

114
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,600
You don't have to extend your time of pain for them.

115
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,600
If you're really in pain,

116
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,600
forget it.

117
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,600
I'm quite late.

118
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,600
I'm quite late.

119
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,600
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

120
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,600
If you're really in pain,

121
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,600
forget it.

122
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,600
You're going to die anyway.

123
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,600
Forget it.

124
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,600
How?

125
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,600
What is he doing?

126
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,600
The sky is falling.

127
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,600
It seems to be falling.

128
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,600
Lighting with my body.

129
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,600
Master, let's go.

130
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,600
Let's go.

131
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,600
Master.

132
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,600
Go now.

133
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Can't you walk?

134
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,600
I can't walk.

135
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,600
You can't walk.

136
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,600
You can run by yourself.

137
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,600
Hold on a little longer.

138
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,600
Get up.

139
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,600
You can't even run?

140
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
Get up, Master. Hold on a little longer.

141
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,600
You want to take me with you?

142
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,600
Yes.

143
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,600
Do you want to die?

144
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,600
No.

145
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,600
You're taking me with you to die.

146
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,600
You're not that stupid, are you?

147
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,600
I'm not stupid.

148
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,600
You've saved me so many times.

149
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,600
Cheer up.

150
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,600
Tell me where it's safer to be.

151
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,600
You're right.

152
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Master.

153
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,600
Si Ma Jiao.

154
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,600
Si Ma Jiao.

155
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,600
Wake up.

156
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,600
Si Ma Jiao.

157
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,600
What's on his foot?

158
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,600
What's on his foot?

159
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,600
Why is it shining?

160
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
Where is this?

161
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
Why does it seem like I'm in someone else's territory?

162
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,600
Since you're here,

163
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
don't rush out.

164
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Si Ma Jiao.

165
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
Boy, it seems that you still remember me.

166
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
It's really...

167
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
it's really you.

168
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
Are you here to kill me

169
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
or to save me?

170
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,600
It's possible to kill

171
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,600
everyone.

172
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,600
But before that,

173
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,600
I need to solve a problem.

174
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,600
If I don't have the patience

175
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
to answer it for you,

176
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
you're not the one

177
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,600
to answer this question.

178
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
The End

179
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,600
Nian Jiu.

180
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,600
You're awake.

181
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
Come.

182
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,600
How do you feel?

183
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,600
Ru Li, why am I here?

184
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
Where's Master?

185
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,600
How is Master now?

186
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
At that time, the Shi family

187
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,600
noticed your action and attacked you.

188
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
I saved you while I was not prepared

189
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,600
and brought you back to me.

190
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,600
Don't worry about Master.

191
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,600
The Shi family and the people of the Ji Daguang

192
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,600
couldn't stop him.

193
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
But Master and Ting Yan

194
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,600
are missing.

195
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,600
Missing?

196
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,600
I have to find Master now.

197
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,600
Wait.

198
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,600
You're going to find him now. It's just a mess.

199
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Sit down first.

200
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
Now the Shi family and the people of the Ji Daguang

201
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,600
are looking for Master everywhere.

202
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
If you go now,

203
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,600
you'll attract attention

204
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
and hurt yourself like this time.

205
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,600
But Master...

206
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
Don't worry. I believe

207
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,600
that he and Ting Yan can escape.

208
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
They'll be fine.

209
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
Well,

210
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
I'm more convenient than you.

211
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,600
I'm going out to find out the results of their search.

212
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,600
You just wait here for me.

213
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
I...

214
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,600
My family's hundreds of years of hard work

215
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
has been ruined

216
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,600
by this guy.

217
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
When I complete the hundred-year plan,

218
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,600
I'll take his life

219
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,600
and his soul.

220
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,600
Master, I've searched the area

221
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,600
and didn't find the trace of Sima Jiao.

222
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,600
He's already been unable to resist.

223
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
How could he

224
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,600
have no trace of the skill of the cheat?

225
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,600
Go find him.

226
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,600
Find him at the third pool.

227
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,600
Yes.

228
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,600
Father, what should we do next?

229
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,600
Sima Jiao is seriously injured

230
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,600
in the outside world.

231
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,600
With his condition,

232
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,600
even if he's in danger for a few days,

233
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,600
he'll be fine.

234
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,600
And now my plan has been exposed.

235
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,600
Baifeng Mountain has been destroyed.

236
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,600
Now,

237
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,600
we can take advantage of his serious injury

238
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,600
and reopen the eight-ball seal.

239
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,600
But Baifeng Mountain's situation has been leaked.

240
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
I'm afraid that Master Ba will

241
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,600
catch Sima Jiao now.

242
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,600
I have no time to deal with this.

243
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,600
Zhenxu,

244
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,600
clean up here.

245
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,600
No one can stay here.

246
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,600
Yes.

247
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,600
You're the demon from the Demon Citadel, right?

248
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,600
I'm the demon?

249
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,600
If the master or other princesses

250
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,600
know your identity,

251
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,600
do you think Sima Jiao will still protect you?

252
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,600
I think

253
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,600
even if I'm the demon,

254
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,600
I shouldn't have hurt anyone.

255
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,600
Don't be nervous.

256
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,600
I know.

257
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,600
My eyes can see the evil.

258
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,600
So I can know

259
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,600
you're not the demon.

260
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,600
That's good.

261
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,600
I was so scared.

262
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
I thought you would take me in.

263
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,600
Many years ago,

264
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,600
I met Sima Jiao in the Three Holy Mountains.

265
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,600
At that time, he was still young.

266
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,600
He showed

267
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,600
his mind and mind.

268
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,600
I gave him the seal of the Great Wall.

269
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,600
I hoped

270
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,600
he would be kind to the living.

271
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,600
I hoped

272
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,600
he would be kind to the living.

273
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,600
In the future,

274
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,600
he would destroy the Gengchen's Mansion

275
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,600
with his own power.

276
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,600
He almost subverted the whole Xiu Zhenjian.

277
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,600
He was a mortal who killed countless innocent people.

278
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,600
The fire of the fire turned into a moth.

279
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,600
The scene of the scene was turned into hell.

280
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,600
The living became greedy

281
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,600
and committed the most heinous crime.

282
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,600
Although he looks like a mortal,

283
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,600
he didn't kill people.

284
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,600
Everything is not absolute.

285
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,600
Even if he died,

286
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
there would be a chance.

287
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,600
In the future,

288
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,600
I saw a chance.

289
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,600
So I predicted

290
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,600
he would have a chance

291
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,600
and a person who would change him.

292
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,600
Who is that person?

293
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,600
I left a miss on him.

294
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,600
I used the power of the formation

295
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
to help him.

296
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,600
At the same time,

297
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,600
if he committed a murder,

298
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,600
he would feel painful.

299
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,600
The pearl

300
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,600
is not a decoration.

301
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,600
The pearl

302
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
is just a seal

303
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
that can be attached to the four-horse sedan.

304
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,600
Since the day it was worn,

305
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,600
no one could untie it.

306
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,600
But actually,

307
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,600
it is still a spirit medicine.

308
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,600
If you can untie this seal,

309
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,600
this spirit medicine can save him.

310
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,600
If you can't untie it,

311
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,600
it means

312
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,600
the four-horse sedan

313
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,600
didn't wait for the chance to survive.

314
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,600
Today,

315
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,600
it is the end

316
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,600
of his life.

317
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,600
Can't you just save him?

318
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,600
Miss, you can try.

319
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,600
I'm sorry.

320
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,600
As expected.

321
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
Since you are a living thing of the four-horse sedan,

322
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,600
you are the vitality of the people.

323
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,600
I hope you can persuade the four-horse sedan

324
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,600
to lead him to the mountain.

325
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,600
There are other spirits in the world.

326
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
I hope the four-horse sedan can be handled well

327
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,600
and do the right thing.

328
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,600
Other spirits?

329
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,600
What do you mean?

330
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,600
Tell the four-horse sedan

331
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,600
that he will understand.

332
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
But he is so badly injured now.

333
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,600
How many bandages are not enough?

334
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,600
Gao Ren.

335
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,600
Gao Ren.

336
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,600
The fate of Fengshan Clan and I

337
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,600
has been ended.

338
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,600
Please take care of yourself in the future.

339
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,600
You just leave like this?

340
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,600
Although the bead

341
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,600
was removed from your feet,

342
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,600
you won't dislike yourself, right?

343
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,600
You don't look as bad as before.

344
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,600
Finally, I saved you.

345
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,600
I saved you.

346
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,600
You look like a little white face.

347
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
Yes.

348
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,600
I am so cold.

349
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,600
I have never been cold.

350
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,600
The most love is complete

351
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,600
Like the rain falling on the horizon

352
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,600
The wind and the moon are in the sky

353
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,600
But love can be changed

354
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,600
The most love is not predestined

355
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,600
The heat is not cold for a lifetime

356
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,600
Even if this life is like a wind and wind

357
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,600
Four-horse sedan, wake up.

358
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,600
The world is not cold for a lifetime

359
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,600
The thing he destroyed

360
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,600
is returned with his blood.

361
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,600
Father, don't worry.

362
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,600
Even if we can't find the four-horse sedan

363
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,600
he is the eyes of the eight great masters

364
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,600
in the Gengchen's mansion.

365
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,600
He can hide for a lifetime.

366
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,600
He can't hide for a lifetime.

367
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,600
Yes.

368
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,600
Everyone has me.

369
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,600
Everyone has me.

370
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,600
Father, how about I go back to the palace now

371
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,600
and ask you about the movements of the eight great masters?

372
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,600
At this time

373
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,600
you still have the heart to do it?

374
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,600
I am a man of love.

375
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,600
I am sorry.

376
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,600
But

377
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,600
I have never asked you for anything.

378
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,600
Only the New Moon and the Dark Snow

379
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,600
I hope father can fulfill it.

380
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,600
Zhenxu

381
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,600
I don't want to make it difficult for you.

382
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,600
When you left, the Dark Snow

383
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,600
was destroyed by the four-horse sedan.

384
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,600
It was discovered by the four-horse sedan.

385
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,600
It died in his hands.

386
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,600
I am useless.

387
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,600
I'm afraid that I can't take the responsibility

388
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,600
for his exposure.

389
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,600
What?

390
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,600
This is impossible.

391
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,600
This is impossible.

392
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,600
Lord An'an

393
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,600
is always careful.

394
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,600
This is impossible.

395
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,600
How could this be?

396
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,600
The four-horse sedan

397
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,600
I want to kill the four-horse sedan

398
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,600
and avenge the Dark Snow.

399
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,600
Zhenxu

400
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,600
When are you going to

401
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,600
learn the magic of soul-worshipping from the Dark Snow?

402
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,600
You have to remember

403
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,600
in this world

404
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,600
no one can be fully convinced except me.

405
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,600
In our great country

406
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,600
there is no flaw.

407
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,600
Father

408
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,600
Father

409
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,600
I always think of you as my god

410
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,600
and I will die for you.

411
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
You know

412
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,600
I only love the Dark Snow.

413
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,600
He is the only one I love.

414
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,600
You know how I feel.

415
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,600
I know.

416
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,600
What do you mean?

417
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,600
What do you mean?

418
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,600
You are my son.

419
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,600
Of course I know you best.

420
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,600
What?

421
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,600
Am I lying to you?

422
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,600
No.

423
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,600
Father

424
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,600
I don't think so.

425
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,600
Good.

426
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,600
Get up.

427
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,600
Zhenxu

428
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,600
from now on

429
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,600
don't be trapped by the Wei army.

430
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,600
The most urgent thing now

431
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,600
is to catch the four-horse sedan

432
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,600
and help us complete the great cause

433
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,600
and get the longevity.

434
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,600
Yes.

435
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,600
At that time

436
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,600
I will kill the four-horse sedan

437
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,600
and avenge the Dark Snow.

438
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,600
You want to sleep?

439
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,600
He is dying.

440
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,600
I just gave him the life-saving pill.

441
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,600
He is in the spiritual talisman.

442
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,600
He was about to die

443
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,600
and even burnt his soul.

444
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,600
Although his body is recovering

445
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,600
his consciousness is almost gone.

446
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,600
What will happen?

447
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,600
He will die.

448
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,600
But the high man's spirit medicine

449
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,600
can only save his body

450
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,600
and not his soul.

451
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,600
You go into his spiritual talisman

452
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,600
and cut his tongue

453
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,600
into pieces.

454
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,600
Hurry up.

455
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,600
Hurry up.

456
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,600
You have been shouting

457
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,600
to kill the four-horse sedan.

458
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,600
Do you have such a good heart?

459
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
You think I want to save him?

460
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,600
I haven't figured out how to separate from him.

461
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,600
If he dies now

462
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,600
we will die together.

463
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,600
So you hurry to save him.

464
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,600
You are so easy.

465
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,600
The four-horse sedan has such a high cultivation.

466
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,600
If he doesn't open the spiritual talisman

467
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,600
how can I get in?

468
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,600
You go and try.

469
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,600
Mom, doesn't he like you?

470
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,600
Maybe you can get in.

471
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,600
How do you know

472
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,600
he likes me?

473
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,600
I don't know what he is thinking.

474
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,600
Don't waste time.

475
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,600
Hurry up.

476
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,600
If you don't hurry

477
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,600
he will die

478
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,600
when he is completely gone.

479
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,600
The four-horse sedan has a high cultivation.

480
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,600
How can I get in?

481
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,600
Stick your forehead.

482
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,600
Stick it.

483
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,600
No, no.

484
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,600
Don't leave, daughter.

485
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,600
Stick your forehead.

486
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,600
No, no.

487
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,600
Don't tire.

488
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,600
Sit right there.

489
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,600
You're all dead now.

490
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,600
Let's go back.

491
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,600
Your plate is in the door.

492
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,000
the spiritual talisman made by the horse.

493
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,640
Why is there no reaction?

494
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,600
Is it because the soul of the God is too badly injured

495
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,400
and there is no attack?

496
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,480
Grand Master, I'm here to save you.

497
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,560
Open the door.

498
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,320
Grand Master.

499
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,520
Sima Jiao.

500
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,600
Jiao Jiao.

501
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,200
It opened so easily.

502
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,320
How come this guy's spiritual talisman

503
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,280
is like a volcano?

504
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,000
It's just that my brother is in such a bad state.

505
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,400
I have to go crazy to get it back.

506
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,000
How come this guy's spiritual talisman

507
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,880
is like a volcano?

508
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,640
It's just that my brother is in such a bad state.

509
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,880
I have to go crazy to get it back.

510
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,800
He will live forever

511
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,240
in the pain of burning with fire.

512
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,120
I don't want him to have such a life.

513
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,480
Why don't we end

514
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,720
the tragedy of the Fengshan Clan?

515
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,640
This is the mission of Jing'er's birth.

516
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,640
If you act recklessly,

517
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,240
you might die.

518
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,840
Sima Jiao.

519
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,080
Such a simple life

520
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,680
and a person who has a sense of emotion.

521
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,680
So,

522
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,960
Sima Jiao, you are such a stubborn cat.

523
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,280
Did I not make you happy

524
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,480
when I took you out to eat and play?

525
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,480
No.

526
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,480
No.

527
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,480
This is the inner box of life and death.

528
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,080
If this key is broken,

529
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,880
I will destroy you and destroy the world.

530
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,880
No.

531
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,480
No.

532
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,080
No.

533
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,480
No.

534
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,080
No.

535
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,480
No.

536
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,480
No.

537
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,480
No.

538
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,480
No.

539
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,480
No.

540
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,480
No.

541
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,480
No.

542
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,480
No.

543
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,480
No.

544
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,480
No.

545
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,480
I hope you will die.

546
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,480
No.

547
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,480
Your Highness.

548
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,480
Hurry, Your Highness.

549
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,480
No.

550
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,080
No.

551
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,480
How can I stop him?

552
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,480
No.

553
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,480
No.

554
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,480
No.

555
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,480
No.

556
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,480
No.

557
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,480
No.

558
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,480
No.

559
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,480
No.

560
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,480
No.

561
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,480
No.

562
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,480
No.

563
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,480
No.

564
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,480
No.

565
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,480
No.

566
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,480
No.

567
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,480
No.

568
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,480
No.

569
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,480
No.

570
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,480
No.

571
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,480
No.

572
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,480
No.

573
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,480

No.

656
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,480
No.

657
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,480
No.

658
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,480
No.

659
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,480
No.

660
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,480
No.

661
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,480
No.

662
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,480
No.

663
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,480
No.

664
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,480
No.

665
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,480
No.

666
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,480
No.

667
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,480
No.

668
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,480
I said,

669
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,480
as long as I don't let you die,

670
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,480
you won't die.

671
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,480
I...

672
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,480
He won't kill me when he wakes up, right?

673
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,480
I...

674
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,480
I...

675
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,480
I...

676
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,480
I...

677
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,480
I...

678
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,480
I...

679
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,480
I...

680
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,480
I...

681
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,480
I...

682
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,480
I told you you can do it.

683
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,480
Now he's much more stable.

684
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,480
Just try a few more times and you'll get it.

685
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,480
Try a few more times?

686
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,480
I died and came back.

687
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,480
I thought you were going to get hurt

688
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,480
if you broke in like this.

689
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,480
Now it seems that

690
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,480
you're not only not hurt,

691
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,480
but also got a good shot.

692
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,480
Shut up, you bad kid.

693
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,480
What?

694
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,480
Doesn't he like you?

695
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,480
Maybe you can get in.

696
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,480
Master.

697
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,480
I'm here to save you.

698
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,480
Open the door.

699
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,480
If you don't tell me

700
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,480
your true thoughts,

701
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,480
I want to hear the truth.

702
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:33,480
Because I value you.

703
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,040
I don't want you to be hurt.

704
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,480
Maybe he likes me a little bit.

705
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,480
No, no, no. I'm too excited.

706
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,480
One of the three misgivings in life is that

707
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,480
he must like me.

708
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,480
He's always over-reacting.

709
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,480
No, no, no.

710
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,480
Calm down, calm down.

711
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,480
He's a living...

712
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,480
At least a 500-year-old ancestor.

713
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,480
How could he possibly like me?

714
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,480
Even if you like him,

715
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,480
he wouldn't care about your liking.

716
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,480
You're just a little brother-in-law who lives with a wife.

717
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,480
You're talking about liking me.

718
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,480
You're so ridiculous.

719
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,480
You're always thinking about love.

720
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,480
No wonder your people

721
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,480
are so poor.

722
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,480
I can't save half of them.

723
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,480
It's a waste to waste half of them.

724
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,480
I'm a good person.

725
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,480
I'll do my best to help you.

726
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,480
Chenning.

727
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:15,320
The

728
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,480
Spirit-G Х dimensions of Liao Tian are all calm and comfortable.

729
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,480
I don't think I've ever looked at you seriously before.

730
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,280
All the memories

731
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,480
seem to be left behind

732
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,280
on the first day we met.

733
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,080
At that time, the body of the person next to me fell.

734
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,880
I also saw my dress and hands.

735
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,680
I was so cold that I was scared.

736
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,480
Then I saw the body of the person next to me.

737
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,680
I gradually understood

738
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,680
your unrepentant past.

739
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,480
The pain I suffered

740
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,080
had to be returned.

741
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,280
Master,

742
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,080
we've been through a lot.

743
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,480
That's right.

744
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,280
I've been through a lot.

745
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,680
I've been through a lot.

746
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,080
That's right.

747
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,880
I'm not that afraid of you.

748
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,480
I'm not afraid at all now.

749
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,680
Even if I think about you, you'll be afraid of me.

750
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,880
To be honest,

751
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,880
I'm not nervous at all.

752
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,280
Why didn't I give birth to a pregnant woman

753
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,480
when I was so weak?

754
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,280
You're awake.

755
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,880
This question is difficult to explain to you.

756
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,880
The baby is so smelly.

757
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:03,880
What's the use of giving birth to a baby?

758
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,080
I have to help him to integrate and give birth to him three times

759
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:05,880
before he can wake up.

760
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,280
Now only two times.

761
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,680
Who taught you math?

762
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,280
I think

763
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,280
I've lost a good lesson.

764
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,880
That may be due to my contribution.

765
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,880
Your chest is getting better.

766
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,880
Your chest is getting better.

767
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,080
This medicine is really good.

768
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,080
The best medicine

769
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,480
is not the medicine.

770
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,880
