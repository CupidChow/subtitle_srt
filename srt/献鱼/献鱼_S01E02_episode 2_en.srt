00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:21,000

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,880
 "In This World, I Only Love You" - Tia Ray 

3
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,600
♫  Let the heavens release a mighty thunder tribulation  ♫

4
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,320
♫  Leading mountains and rivers so mighty and vast to shatter before my eyes  ♫

5
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,580
♫  Lifetimes of cultivation bring years of splendor   ♫

6
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:40,340
♫  Yet turn to dust between fingers in an instant  ♫

7
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,120
♫  When immortals and demons discern good and evil with a single thought  ♫

8
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,240
♫  Many souls escape into the endless wilderness  ♫

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,600
♫  I journey forward with the Spirit Fire in my veins  ♫

10
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,880
♫  I defy fate just to remain by your side  ♫

11
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,880
♫  Falling thousands of feet in love is like heavy rain  ♫

12
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,660
♫  Pouring down between heaven and earth  ♫

13
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:08,560
♫  Drunk in love  ♫

14
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,240
♫  Love and hate vanish in an instant  ♫

15
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,280
♫  Falling into an endless abyss of love  ♫

16
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,440
♫  Stirring waves upending a lifetime  ♫

17
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,680
♫  Even if this life leads to ruin  ♫

18
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,920
♫  I'd still choose to be entangled with you  ♫

19
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,125
♫  Through all lifetimes  ♫

20
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:36,440
   

21
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,362
   

22
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:47,570
Chuhui has high cultivation skills, but she still failed to get in.

23
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:51,260
Someone must have meddled with the selection.

24
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,570
Don't be angry, Palace Master.

25
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,900
One of our chosen disciples is Yu Rongrong.

26
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,130
Her cultivation skills are passable.

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,150
If she and the chosen disciples can steal the Blood Clot Flower,

28
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,160
it'll provide the Moon Palace with thousands of years of cultivation.

29
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,290
Why not do it?

30
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,200
Congratulations, Palace Master.

31
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,160
Based on our plan, An Xue and Tan Muying were selected.

32
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,700
I didn't expect that slave-born Ye Ruling would also be selected.

33
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,110
Although she's not as good as An Xue,

34
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,710
she's the most gifted captive from the Demon Realm.

35
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,770
She'll be our second bargaining chip.

36
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,860
Mu Nisheng is very talented. She can complete your task.

37
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,620
As expected of your sisters,

38
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,770
Miss Xiyue and Miss Wanqing were selected.

39
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,050
Once they bear Sima's children,

40
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:45,270
the Spirit Fire will fall into our hands.

41
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,830
By then, we will only need to kill Sima Jiao

42
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:53,240
and take his place as the masters of Gengchen Immortal Mansion.

43
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,770
Anyone here?

44
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,410
This is nice.

45
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,570
It's not high, and it's far from Central Pagoda.

46
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:23,290
No colleagues will drop by.

47
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,650
I'll lay down a thick quilt here for my own luxury suite.

48
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,810
There's plenty of sunshine, too. 
    

49
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,550
It's much better than the place I used to rent.

50
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,540
 This Universe Pouch may be low-grade, 

51
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,290
 but it's enough for replenishing daily supplies. 

52
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,290
 Remember not to make enemies in Three Saints Mountain. 

53
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:54,710
 Just keep to yourself and don't try to stand out. 

54
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:59,250
Master, I won't stand out.

55
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,250
I almost had my own funeral.

56
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,300
Wow, you can really hold a lot!

57
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,960
Such a tiny Universe Pouch can hold so many items.

58
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,280
If I had known earlier, I would have packed all my belongings.

59
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,760
 There's even someone bolder here. 

60
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,640
 Being able to survive the violent Grandmaster's wrath 

61
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,150
 is truly a blessing for me. 

62
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,560
That person from the Demon Realm that you took so much effort to send,

63
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,780
apart from being ordinary and being weaker than other cultivators,

64
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,610
there's still no news from her.

65
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:50,470
You only need to know that

66
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,380
she's the only one who can kill Sima Jiao. 
    

67
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,920
Young Palace Master, if you have the time to probe me,

68
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,000
why not think of a way to use the Bone-eroding Poison in her body

69
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,180
to fulfill our pact sooner.

70
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:10,220
I didn't expect that I would spend my long-awaited vacation here.

71
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,620
She's actually sleeping.

72
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:33,330
Did Gengchen Immortal Mansion deliberately send me this useless person to provoke me,

73
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,350
or can they only resort to using this ploy?

74
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:40,370
 They didn't even realize she was a spy from the Demon Realm. 

75
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,160
 I didn't do anything, Grandmaster. 

76
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,270
Stupid snake.

77
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:53,400
Why would I get a headache over a mere Demon Realm woman?

78
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,990
It's obvious the Spirit Fire in my body is acting up.

79
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:23,110
 I want to see what she's really after. 

80
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,620
How can she sleep so soundly?

81
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,930
It stinks.

82
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,500
Let's go.

83
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,790
Why didn't my alarm ring?

84
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,410
These flowers are rather strange.

85
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,010
They even glow at night.

86
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,140
Isn't that the girl who was blasted by the Grandmaster the other day?

87
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,702
   

88
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,350
This is bad.

89
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,810
Yu Rongrong's life flame has gone out!

90
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,780
Return!

91
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,080
Fortunately, her soul hasn't scattered yet.

92
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,960
- Palace Master. 
 - I told you to be careful in what you do.

93
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,340
How did you die so soon?

94
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,610
I'm dead?

95
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:48,220
I saw many flowers at the Grandmaster's place.

96
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,420
I wanted to pick one, but I ended up here after that.

97
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:55,570
Could it be the Sun-moon Shade?

98
00:09:55,570 --> 00:10:00,480
Palace Master Yue, fortunately, our disciples are given a chance to be reborn.

99
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,890
You should quickly prepare to send her for rebirth.

100
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,460
Two life lamps extinguished in a single day.

101
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,060
The Grandmaster is still as ruthless as ever.

102
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,760
He must still be resentful...

103
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:24,360
and has vented his hatred onto the disciples.

104
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:28,730
Do you think he cares about these disciples?

105
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,820
He still remembers the old scores with the Eight Great Palaces.

106
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,530
Back then, our fathers...

107
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,960
 I can't bear it! 

108
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,470
 I can't bear it! 

109
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,490
 - Grandmaster! 
 - It's very unbearable! 

110
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,680
 - Grandmaster! 
 - I can't bear it! 

111
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,250
 - Grandmaster. 
 - Remove this fire from my body! 

112
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,590
 Bear with it, Grandmaster. 

113
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,950
 You'll feel much better when the blood is released. 

114
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,460
The Eight Great Palaces once drank his blood

115
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:02,460
and also locked him in the Three Saints Mountain for 500 years.

116
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,300
His hatred grows day by day.

117
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,220
If he didn't show any mercy to them,

118
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,130
just imagine if he were to confront us directly.

119
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:15,410
He'd be even more ruthless.

120
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,610
Palace Master Yin is right.

121
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:21,340
He's saying that we should strike first.

122
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,800
But...

123
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:34,090
With the Spirit Fire in his body, his power surpasses us.

124
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,490
If we provoke him now,

125
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:39,980
we'll only die a miserable death.

126
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,890
Although he has refined a Spirit Fire avatar,

127
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,730
but the mountain's seal is still stable.

128
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:51,430
I urge everyone not to act recklessly.

129
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,320
Why do you think these disciples came here?

130
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,030
They're just following orders from those old fools in Gengchen Immortal Mansion.

131
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:06,110
They are here to take my blood and life.

132
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,340
They don't even dare to come here.

133
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,080
That person...

134
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,410
swaggered in and relaxes at my place.

135
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,440
 Grandmaster... Wait... 

136
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,960
 Grandmaster... 

137
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,940
 You were watching me. 

138
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,160
 I didn't. I'm merely cross-eyed. 

139
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,630
 I was looking... 

140
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,900
 I was looking over there! 

141
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:50,540
 Tell me. What are you really here for? 

142
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,870
 To adjust my work-life balance and relax. 

143
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,290
 In short, a vacation. 

144
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,040
 What's going on? 

145
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,560
 Why did my words change? 

146
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,870
 He must be behind this. 

147
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,710
 This fantasy world has harmed me. 

148
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:10,110
 It even has this stuff that's effective in making one tell the truth. 

149
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,750
 - Don't you want to kill me? 
 - I don't. 

150
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,010
 Why don't you want to kill me? 

151
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:17,470
 I'm just an innocent slacker. 

152
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,080
 With my cultivation level, 

153
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,730
 why would I want to kill you? 

154
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,510
 Really? 

155
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,590
 If not, then? 

156
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,510
 Do you have a phobia of being pursued and killed? 

157
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,350
 Is your brain damaged? 

158
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,420
 I'm doomed. This effect is too harmful. 

159
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,080
 Help! Are you killing me or not? 

160
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,320
 Make it a quick death! 

161
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,740
 I wouldn't dare. 

162
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,560
 Was he in seclusion for too long that he has lost his mind? 

163
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,110
 Did Gengchen Immortal Mansion make a mistake from the start? 

164
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:18,080
 Why send so many disciples to serve him? 

165
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,620
 They should've sent a doctor to fix his head. 

166
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:44,490
Get off. Don't lick me, you rotten mutt.

167
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,470
Senior Brother Snake, look at my scrawny arms and legs.

168
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,590
Spare my life, okay?

169
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,960
If you eat me, I'll only get stuck in your teeth!

170
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,690
You want to drink this?

171
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,450
You should have said so earlier.

172
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:16,300
Here you go.

173
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,960
Sorry. I wasn't thinking properly.

174
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,590
Actually, this is a specialty of Serene Vale.

175
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:29,340
This Pure Spirit Bamboo keeps producing unlimited Pure Spirit Dew.

176
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,630
I usually drink it like milk tea.

177
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,120
I didn't know you liked this, too.

178
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,220
Why's this snake acting like a dog?

179
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:45,340
Being able to raise a giant serpent into a loyal hound,

180
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,850
the Grandmaster truly lives up to his name.

181
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,330
I managed to survive for another day.

182
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,750
 I can't bear it! 

183
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,280
 I can't bear it! 

184
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,260
 It's unbearable! 

185
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,320
You dare to drink something from the Demon Realm?

186
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,680
Tired of living, are you?

187
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:42,040
You only went there twice to eat with her

188
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,540
and you're speaking up for her now?

189
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,490
The people in this world are greedy.

190
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:52,230
Even more so for those from the Demon Realm.

191
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,390
They either want the Spirit Fire...

192
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,990
or covet the Blood Clot Flower.

193
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,120
She's just better at pretending than the rest.

194
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,840
Martial Aunt Nisheng,

195
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,780
Yu Rongrong from Moon Palace vanished last night.

196
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,400
Her body can't be found.

197
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,680
You can only enter this mountain and can't leave.

198
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,650
You can't even go back to the palace. 
    

199
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,990
No one can guess the Grandmaster's temper.

200
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,750
Don't panic yet.

201
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:31,400
No matter what, staying alive is more important.

202
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,650
If one of us can win the Grandmaster's favor

203
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,760
and become his wife,

204
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,430
Heaven Palace will rise to lead the Eight Great Palaces.

205
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:44,350
 As what Palace Master said, Sima Jiao is indeed cruel and lawless. 

206
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:47,700
 We must find his weakness and kill him as soon as possible. 

207
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,220
 The Fengshan Spirit Fire has merged with Sima Jiao. 
   

208
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,640
 If Sima Jiao dies, the Spirit Fire will go out, too. 

209
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,490
 As such, the Gengchen Immortal Mansion will lose its spiritual energy. 

210
00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:59,750
 How will we cultivate? 

211
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,790
 The Blood Clot Flower is grown by the Spirit Fire 

212
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,270
 feeding on Sima Jiao's blood. 

213
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,790
 Eating this flower and drinking his blood 

214
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,160
 will raise our cultivation level. 

215
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,270
 Have you forgotten what the Palace Master said? 

216
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,230
 Back then, he offended Sima Jiao. 

217
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:17,070
 If one day, Sima Jiao is unhappy and wants to settle old scores, 

218
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,920
 we'll all die a tragic death. 

219
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,900
 What's there left to cultivate? 

220
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:27,620
 You called me here just to discuss this impossible task? 

221
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:31,470
 Ye Ruling, stop acting like it's none of your business. 

222
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:36,800
 Don't forget that your clan is still under the Palace Master's control. 

223
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:51,370
I've prepared this for Senior Brother Snake.

224
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,060
I hope he won't wake me tonight.

225
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,560
Let me have a good night's sleep.

226
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:15,230
Why does this feel so familiar?

227
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:18,450
Do cultivators get period cramps, too?

228
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,700
It's so painful.

229
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,100
Why is the pain getting worse?

230
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,610
Didn't Ming Li say this Companion Bell can trigger

231
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,450
Liao Tingyan's Bone-eroding Poison?

232
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,460
Why isn't she showing any reaction after being summoned by it?

233
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:48,160
Does she really think that by clinging to Sima Jiao,

234
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,760
she can escape our control?

235
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:53,910
Fine.

236
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:59,590
Let's see how long you can survive this Bone-eroding Poison.

237
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,040
Stupid snake.

238
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,100
What did you bring back?

239
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,180
She's been poisoned by a demonic poison.

240
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,960
Why do you want to save her?

241
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,470
Do you know what she's here for?

242
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,680
You don't know anything, but you brought her here?

243
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,700
Are you seeking death?

244
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:38,440
This poison is just a small trick from the Demon Realm to control puppets.

245
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,000
She actually fell asleep.

246
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:04,220
Among all the countless schemes sent by the Demon Realm,

247
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,510
they sent someone like this?

248
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:11,310
 Looks like she's smarter than those other fools. 

249
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,740
Not only did she come to seek death in front of me,

250
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,420
she even won over that stupid snake.

251
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,960
Such deep scheming...

252
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:23,050
suits this face.

253
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,620
Grandmaster...

254
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:28,040
Why am I in your hall?

255
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,240
Your acting is not bad.

256
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,440
You dared to use that stupid snake to bring you to my Central Pagoda.

257
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:45,750
I could have fainted last night from the stomach pain.

258
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,910
I guess Senior Brother Snake was worried and wanted you to save me.

259
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:51,620
I didn't mean to trouble you.

260
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,360
My stomach doesn't hurt anymore?

261
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,230
You drank my blood.

262
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,020
Of course, it won't hurt.

263
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,200
I drank your blood?

264
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:08,650
If you dare to spit it out, I'll kill you.

265
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:16,780
Your blood even works as a painkiller?

266
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,760
Not only does it ease pain,

267
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,960
it boosts cultivation, too.

268
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,920
Everyone in this world wants it.

269
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,840
Count me out.

270
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,800
I'm not that interested.

271
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:36,030
Looking at you now

272
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:39,070
makes me want to kill you immediately.

273
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:47,250
No... Don't... I... I will dirty your hands...

274
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:04,140
If it hurts that much,

275
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,890
why didn't you just kill me?

276
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:11,550
There's no reason, nor grudge.

277
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:23,420
In this world, killing doesn't need a grudge,

278
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,110
much less a reason.

279
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,360
Like right now,

280
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,710
there's no grudge, nor reason.

281
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:35,000
I just want to kill you.

282
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:39,030
What can you do about it?

283
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,230
I can't do anything.

284
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,530
I can't defeat you anyway.

285
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,970
You want me to kill you,

286
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,970
but I won't.

287
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,710
From now on,

288
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,760
you'll serve me.

289
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,830
Me?

290
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:33,370
I'm leaving now.

291
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,690
No grudge...

292
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:53,280
Nor reason...

293
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,830
So, she doesn't want to kill me?

294
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,810
Everyone in Gengchen Immortal Mansion is after my blood.

295
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:10,620
If not for the fact that only I can feed the Spirit Fire,

296
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,010
if not for the Spirit Fire nourishing the whole palace,

297
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:19,750
if not for the fact they can't defeat me,

298
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:22,760
I would have been torn apart and eaten up.

299
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,120
The Demon Realm has always wanted to destroy Gengchen Immortal Mansion

300
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,150
and extinguish the Spirit Fire.

301
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:32,370
They should want to kill me.

302
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:34,010
So, why...

303
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,400
doesn't she want to kill me?

304
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,960
After such a nerve-racking day,

305
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,700
I may not be able to sleep well tonight.

306
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,510
Ridiculous.

307
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:57,440
The answers from the Oath of Truth won't be false.

308
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,430
If she truly has no intention to kill,

309
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:03,660
perhaps I can use her.

310
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,630
 500 years... 

311
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,070
 The night of the new moon. 

312
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,840
Martial Aunt,

313
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,300
we've waited here every day, 
    

314
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,550
but this door has never opened for us.

315
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:25,940
Will Grandmaster really see us?

316
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,610
Are you as shallow as those people?

317
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:30,470
If you're afraid, just leave.

318
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:31,890
No, Martial Aunt.

319
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:35,990
I just don't know how to face Grandmaster.

320
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:39,370
The Palace Master once said that, in front of this grandmaster,

321
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:42,160
it's impossible to hide anything.

322
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,790
We only need to show our most humble and devout posture,

323
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,890
and reveal our thoughts to him.

324
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:50,130
As long as I keep trying,

325
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:53,420
the Grandmaster will be moved by me.

326
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:00,960
Senior Brother Snake really meant well, but created trouble.

327
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,860
I haven't even rested well for a few days,

328
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,850
and it's back to work again.

329
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,920
I'm here to pay respects to you.

330
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:13,050
Please accept me, Grandmaster.

331
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:18,790
 She's a brave one. 

332
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:22,600
 She even took the initiative to request that moody Grandmaster. 

333
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,070
 No wonder she can lead the group. 

334
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:28,200
 Her level of awareness is amazing. 

335
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,150
 If only I could trade places with her. 

336
00:29:38,112 --> 00:29:39,360
Hi.

337
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,360
You're still alive?

338
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,790
What's wrong with you people today?

339
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,780
You even say this when you see me.

340
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,160
I don't want to die.

341
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,230
I'm staying alive.

342
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,600
If you want to stay alive,

343
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,510
keep your distance.

344
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:55,900
I would love to.

345
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,410
What's wrong with the Grandmaster?

346
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:06,610
He wants me to work here and doesn't give me an access card.

347
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:08,510
How am I supposed to get in?

348
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:12,370
Martial Aunt, she probably doesn't know the Grandmaster's temper.

349
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:13,790
Should we warn her?

350
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:15,160
Is there a need to meddle?

351
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,710
We're the only ones here who can be safe.

352
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:21,940
I fear she will die under the pagoda today.

353
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,160
Grandmaster, I'm here to work!

354
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:33,440
How... How is this possible?

355
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,060
Just knock on the door to enter?

356
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,580
How did she go in just now?

357
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:59,600
I wonder what the Grandmaster wants me to do.

358
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,340
What's in that bag?

359
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:10,110
These are my daily essentials.

360
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:12,600
I took them out of my Universe Pouch,

361
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,550
but I don't really know spiritual power.

362
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:17,510
I can only take things out, not put them in.

363
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:20,700
Put down your junk and follow me.

364
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:45,960
Grandmaster, is that person outside dead?

365
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,870
What do you think?

366
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:51,350
Why did you kill her?

367
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,140
Compared to those who are greedy at a glance,

368
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,490
I hate those mindless puppets without souls the most.

369
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,490
Killing her didn't even interest me.

370
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:07,340
Why then?

371
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,350
She was too noisy...

372
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,020
and irritated me.

373
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:17,120
 He kills over annoyance? 

374
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,100
 This grandmaster is really crazy. 

375
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,160
 I'm exhausted. 

376
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,050
 This is more tiring than the subway during rush hour. 

377
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,320
Can't walk anymore?

378
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:55,840
Grandmaster, why are we climbing so high? What are we doing?

379
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,580
We are not doing anything.

380
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,680
 Looks like he's just too bored 

381
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,200
 and wants to taunt me to death. 

382
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,960
 At least, I was still a human in my old job. 

383
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,200
 In this current cultivation world, 

384
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,920
 I'm just a toy of the boss. 

385
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,000
Start by cleaning this floor.

386
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:31,030
I'll admit, the view here is pretty nice.

387
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,960
It's just that the Grandmaster's mood swings

388
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,450
ruin the work experience.

389
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:53,020
But after being confined for 500 years alone in this pagoda,

390
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:56,300
it's also not strange that his mind is twisted.

391
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,550
Grandmaster, look at how hardworking I am!

392
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,580
I'm working!

393
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,930
Senior Brother Snake, it's you.

394
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:19,430
I thought the boss was here to check. You scared me.

395
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:25,260
What's this about?

396
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:27,920
Are you taking me somewhere?

397
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,060
Or has the Grandmaster done something again?

398
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,030
He abandoned me here just now

399
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:38,850
and didn't tell me what my working hours are.

400
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:43,750
Are you taking me straight to him?

401
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,970
 If he's not sealed, he'll wipe out the whole immortal mansion. 

402
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,240
 The Spirit Fire has merged with him. 

403
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,030
 As long as we keep him alive, 

404
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:03,960
 he can supply us with spiritual energies. 

405
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,440
 Why not add another seal on top of this restriction? 

406
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:15,880
 This restriction connects his meridians and suppresses him. He won't be able to kill himself. 

407
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,530
 No matter how painful it is, he can't seek death. 

408
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:56,030
Grandmaster, spare my life! I didn't do anything.

409
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:58,830
Your pet brought me in here.

410
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,620
Grandmaster.

411
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,150
My spiritual power is too weak.

412
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:18,240
I can't help you.

413
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,600
Why don't I knock off work early?

414
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,220
 What on earth is going on? 

415
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,880
Grandmaster,

416
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,580
are you having a fever?

417
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,550

424

Your pet brought me in here.

426
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:29,680
I didn't mean to offend you at all.

427
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,740
 She can actually ease

 the burning pain from my Spirit Fire.
