song title

3
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,640
 ♫ Heavens strike with thunderous wrath ♫ 

4
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,520
 ♫ Mountains and rivers shatter before my eyes ♫ 

5
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,680
 ♫ Endless splendor
cultivated through lifetimes ♫ 

6
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,280
 ♫ Turns to dust between my fingers
in an instant ♫ 

7
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,180
 ♫ When the line
between good and evil is clear ♫ 

8
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,240
 ♫ Countless souls drift
into the boundless wilds ♫ 

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,700
 ♫ Carrying the spirit fire forward ♫ 

10
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,780
 ♫ I defy fate ♫   ♫ Just to remain by your side ♫ 

11
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,900
 ♫ Falling into love's abyss ♫ 

12
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,760
 ♫ Like heavy rain pouring down ♫ 

13
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,560
 ♫ Drunk on romance ♫ 

14
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,260
 ♫ In a blink, love and hate
vanish into illusion ♫ 

15
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:16,300
 ♫ Falling into endless love ♫ 

16
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,520
 ♫ Stirring waves upending a lifetime ♫ 

17
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,600
 ♫ Even if this life leads to ruin ♫ 

18
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,080
 ♫ I still choose to be entangled with you ♫ 

19
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,525
 ♫ Through all lifetimes ♫ 

20
00:01:28,525 --> 00:01:36,640
 

21
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,610
 

22
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:42,620
Next time, we can host a feast here, too.

23
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,360
All you think about is having fun.

24
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,830
Already forgot what the teacher taught?

25
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:49,720
Why spoil my good mood?

26
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,700
Let's go.

27
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,150
Wait!

28
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,360
You must be Yong Shi Qiu of Night Palace.

29
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,960
Why rush off?

30
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,670
Why not stay here with your sister?

31
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,210
There's more fun to come.

32
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,690
It'd be a pity to miss it.

33
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,010
A feast, huh?

34
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:12,810
Stop spouting nonsense.

35
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,940
My brother's just straightforward.

36
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,280
Let's meet another day.

37
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,080
Back so soon?

38
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,800
I thought you'd be busy out there for days.

39
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,130
What, don't want to see me?

40
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,720
No way.

41
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,080
Do you like it here?

42
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,240
It's okay.

43
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,490
The food's better than at the academy.

44
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,290
Shame I was too busy entertaining them.

45
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,420
Didn't get to enjoy it.

46
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:02,930
With your cultivation now, you don't need this food.

47
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:07,220
Other than filling your stomach, it's useless.

48
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,650
I eat simply because I'm greedy.

49
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,130
I really can't understand the pleasure of indulging in food.

50
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:26,270
If someone can't sleep well or savor good food,

51
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,250
their life must lose a lot of joy.

52
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,140
I suggest you try more good food.

53
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,230
It really helps keep you happy.

54
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,020
Where are we going?

55
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:46,090
So, you brought me here for a private feast!

56
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,440
Those people never stop talking.

57
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,010
And you barely ate either, right?

58
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,290
You know me too well!

59
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,590
I'll eat...

60
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,100
Go on, eat.

61
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,540
The custard's silky smooth,
and melts in your mouth.

62
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:13,860
That faint touch of mushroom brings the flavor to its peak.

63
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,000
A taste so divine!

64
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,560
What's with you?

65
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,580
You've got food in front of you, yet you insist on taking mine.

66
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,700
I take whatever I want.

67
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,760
Crisp and springy!

68
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,490
What's so great about this stuff?

69
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,980
 Annoying pest. 

70
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,130
 I'd love to dump the whole plate on his head! 

71
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,330
You heard that?

72
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,270
Heard what?

73
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,390
Sima Jiao, tell me the truth.

74
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,650
Can you hear what I'm thinking?

75
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,400
Say something.

76
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,600
You can hear my thoughts, can't you?

77
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,440
Liar!

78
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,200
Didn't you say you can't read minds?

79
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,740
I really can't.

80
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,580
But lately, when your emotions run wild,

81
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,900
I sometimes hear what's on your mind.

82
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,570
Only yours.

83
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,680
No need to be that precise.

84
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,540
Why just mine?

85
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,340
Abilities shift with circumstances.

86
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,880
It's common in the cultivation world.

87
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,060
Any changes with you?

88
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:46,330
 Don't tell me... it's because of our soul bond. 

89
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:49,310
 So, even without the Truth Spell, you can hear my heart? 

90
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:54,650
Didn't the teacher explain this
back at the academy?

91
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,680
 Oh, Liao Ting Yan... 

92
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,030
 Better pay attention in those cultivation health classes. 

93
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,860
All those thoughts of yours...

94
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,100
I can hear them all.

95
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,250
One times one is two...

96
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,830
Grandmaster, do you catch every thought

97
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:26,820
in my head when I get worked up?

98
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,690
Not word for word that clear.

99
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:35,840
But if you start cursing someone, I'll know.

100
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,000
So, I'd suggest you stay calm.

101
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,640
 You've got some nerve saying that! 

102
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,170
 You're the one who keeps losing your temper... 

103
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,460
 Four times four is sixteen. 

104
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,840
 Five times five is twenty-five... 

105
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,610
All you ever think about
is eating and sleeping.

106
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:55,060
Anything else you're afraid I'll find out?

107
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,440
Seems you don't really know me that well.

108
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,150
Where I come from, info's exploding everywhere.

109
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,520
All kinds of crazy things exist.

110
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,490
Way beyond what you can imagine.

111
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,500
I'd better recite the times table
to clear my head.

112
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,710
No more thinking...

113
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:37,160
Never seen anyone like this.

114
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,910
No wonder you're from the Demon Realm.

115
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,400
Really eye-opening.

116
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,040
Please stop peeking into my mind!

117
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,410
 Forget it. 

118
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:58,320
 From today, I'll be calm and peaceful. 

119
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,240
 Thinking back, ever since this soul bond, I've cursed him plenty in my head. 

120
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,830
 Did he hear it all? 

121
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,510
Yes.

122
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:13,950
Grandmaster, please quit speaking directly to my mind.

123
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,810
 Wait... 

124
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,830
 I cursed Sima Jiao like crazy before, yet he never reacted. 

125
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:28,100
 No anger, no killing me. 

126
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,590
 Could it be true love? 

127
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,350
Didn't he hear it?

128
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,570
Did you really not hear it?

129
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:54,120
I'm resting now. Do as you please.

130
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:11,040
Stay calm. Don't stir trouble.

131
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,940
I'm already staying calm.

132
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,900
Go rest in your own bed!

133
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,180
My bed...

134
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,560
is right here.

135
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,660
Didn't you have trouble sleeping before?

136
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,220
Now you fall asleep faster than me.

137
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:00,060
 ♫ Falling into love's abyss ♫ 

138
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,320
 ♫ Like heavy rain pouring down ♫ 

139
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,320
Between us, who's the real slacker?

140
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,400
 ♫ In a blink, love and hate
vanish into illusion ♫ 

141
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,500
 ♫ Falling into endless love ♫ 

142
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,700
 ♫ Stirring waves upending a lifetime ♫ 

143
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,880
 ♫ Even if this life leads to ruin ♫ 

144
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,220
 ♫ I still choose to be entangled with you ♫ 

145
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,600
 ♫ Through all lifetimes ♫ 

146
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,590
- Hua Rong Xue.
- Here.

147
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,510
- Qi Le Tian.
- Here.

148
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:34,320
- Yong Ling Chun.
- Here.

149
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,350
Yong Shi Qiu.

150
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,950
Here.

151
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,320
Today's lesson is on the soul
and the soul manor.

152
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,220
The soul manor is one's most private place.

153
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,040
It must be guarded well.

154
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,710
If invaded, it means death or ruin.

155
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:58,220
Sir, what about cultivation partners?

156
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,350
Quiet!

157
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:06,880
Even cultivation partners don't easily enter each other's soul manor.

158
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,350
It's extremely dangerous.

159
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:15,630
If you're truly fortunate to find a partner

160
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:20,510
who shares life and death with you,
you may attempt it.

161
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:24,860
But you're still young, unaware of the dangers.

162
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:31,460
Don't chase a moment's pleasure
and lose what matters.

163
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:36,750
 Feels like Sima Jiao and I are problem students sneaking forbidden fruit. 

164
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,920
Soul bond is the most intimate bond.

165
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:46,090
If one dies, the other often can't survive.

166
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:51,600
Because the souls are bound too tightly,

167
00:12:53,990 --> 00:13:00,170
the feelings too deep to cut apart.

168
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:06,300
So, never take this lightly.

169
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,110
 We haven't even started dating, and it's straight to life-and-death vows? 

170
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:15,860
 Is it still time for Sima Jiao and me to switch to separate beds? 

171
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,750
 No, wait. It's one thing if I didn't know. 

172
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,470
 But how could Sima Jiao not know? 

173
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:28,160
 Could it be...
he's already seen me as his other half? 

174
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:43,490
Ting Yan. I won't be here tonight.

175
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,060
Then be careful out there.

176
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,220
Want me to bring you something?

177
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,350
Why ask like that?

178
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,800
I'm heading out.

179
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,340
If you want anything, I'll bring it back.

180
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:03,040
 Coming home with gifts
sounds just like a married couple. 

181
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,470
Anything's fine. I'm not picky.

182
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,710
All right, wait for me.

183
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:11,100
I won't keep you waiting long.

184
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:19,040
Why's he being so gentle?

185
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:25,430
Is he really taking me
as his cultivation partner?

186
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,630
Sect Master Shi, why summon me?

187
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,820
Have you tracked down Sima Jiao?

188
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,130
Madam Ye. Please, sit.

189
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:59,830
Lately, my clan has faced repeated attacks.

190
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,440
I sent people to investigate.

191
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,280
However, we found no clues linked to Sima Jiao.

192
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:12,280
So, could you help look into this?

193
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,660
No need to beat around the bush.

194
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,800
Right outside your hall,

195
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:27,060
my disciple found something interesting.

196
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,380
A scale from Nian Jiu!

197
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:37,250
So, you set spies on me.

198
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:40,700
How is that spying? We're allies.

199
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,300
Allies should care for one another.

200
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:48,510
But it seems this ally of mine is keeping secrets.

201
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,800
The black serpent is indeed in my hall.

202
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,980
But he knows nothing
of Sima Jiao's whereabouts.

203
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,160
Truly nothing?

204
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,660
Yes.

205
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,400
But is he honest with you or not?

206
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,470
We can test and see.

207
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:10,100
He's the only being
who stays by Sima Jiao's side.

208
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:16,280
So, tell me, if this black serpent is in danger,

209
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:20,200
won't Sima Jiao step in to save him?

210
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,710
You want me to harm the serpent?

211
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,910
You can't bear to?

212
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,340
You're back.

213
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,190
I'm back.

214
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,080
What's that in your hands?

215
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:15,070
Well... I found it in a treasure vault.

216
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:17,930
It looked good, so I brought it back for you.

217
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,640
This isn't just an ordinary mirror, is it?

218
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,440
How do you use it?

219
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,960
If you infuse it with spiritual power,

220
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:31,000
the two mirrors can reflect each other even from thousands of miles away.

221
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,740
Shame the resolution
isn't as clear as a cell phone.

222
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,310
What?

223
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:43,170
Nothing. I like it.

224
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,920
Liar. If you don't like it, I'll break it.

225
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,510
What are you doing? I said I like it!

226
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,560
Give it back.

227
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,310
You went out of your way to bring me this gift.

228
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,710
So, hand it over!

229
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:05,230
Then how are you going to thank me?

230
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,480
 ♫ Snow not gone, flame not out ♫ 

231
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,080
 ♫ Prism of three lifetimes ♫ 

232
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,820
 ♫ You, untouched by moon's regrets ♫ 

233
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,730
Is this your thank-you gift?

234
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,810
Let me be clear...

235
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,810
This is not thanks.

236
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,440
From now on,
you'll be more than just my boyfriend.

237
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,780
 ♫ We wander the mortal world in search ♫ 

238
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,680
Boyfriend?

239
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,920
It means two people share one heart, admiring each other.

240
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,990
 ♫ Be it destiny or doom,
I light up the endless night ♫ 

241
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,400
More than just boyfriend...

242
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,960
What is it?

243
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,650
In your words here, it would be...

244
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,320
 ♫ Snow not gone, flame not out ♫ 

245
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,780
 ♫ Prism of three lifetimes ♫ 

246
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:15,580
 ♫ You, untouched by moon's regrets ♫ 

247
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:19,180
 ♫ No one reaches, no one hears ♫ 

248
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:22,960
 ♫ Thousands of stars in your eyes ♫ 

249
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,325
 ♫ Fall like fireworks ♫ 

250
00:20:28,325 --> 00:20:31,980
 ♫ No fate's tangle, no parting swans ♫ 

251
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,740
 ♫ Memories fade ♫ 

252
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,180
 ♫ We wander the mortal world in search ♫ 

253
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:41,300
 ♫ Yet forget the reason why ♫ 

254
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,680
 ♫ Cycle back to raging flames ♫ 

255
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,160
 ♫ Even if my very soul were to vanish ♫ 

256
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:52,080
 ♫ Be it destiny or doom,
I light up the endless night ♫ 

257
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,000
 ♫ To chase the darkness away from your dreams ♫ 

258
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,440
 ♫ Even if heaven and earth turned to ash ♫ 

259
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,360
 ♫ I would never regret the day I met you ♫ 

260
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:09,780
 ♫ Mad love blooms a lotus in the heart... ♫ 

261
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:15,040
 From now on,
you'll be more than just my boyfriend. 

262
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,720
Liao Ting Yan, stop it!

263
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:43,090
So, even this short-tempered Grandmaster can be as soft as a kitten.

264
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,290
Hey, my mirror!

265
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,920
If only there are more of these mirrors.

266
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:22,610
We can place them everywhere, and gather all the images onto one.

267
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,690
That will be live streaming!

268
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,420
Live streaming?

269
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,050
What's...

270
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,400
live streaming?

271
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,960
It means you can watch
everything happening in real time.

272
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,160
For example, put a mirror in the square of Gengchen Celestial Palace,

273
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,750
we'll see disciples dueling.

274
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:51,260
Put one in a busy marketplace, we'll see the bustle of mortal life.

275
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,740
Even in the forests and mountains, among flowers and trees,

276
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:59,200
we'll get a nature documentary.

277
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,300
Won't that be wonderful?

278
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,620
Sounds pretty good.

279
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,070
From now on, if you hear a sound from it,

280
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:14,620
just channel spiritual power
and tap the mirror.

281
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,690
Then I'll see whatever I want?

282
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:46,360
Today, I'll discuss
the Spirit Fire of Fengshan.

283
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:51,840
Spirit Fire is the foundation
of Gengchen Celestial Palace.

284
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,030
The fire nurtures the palace's spiritual veins.

285
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:08,360
Without it, the Celestial Palace lands
will lose all spiritual energy,

286
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,920
turning into a barren waste.

287
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,840
Even its fortune will wither.

288
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,680
The Sima clan sustains
the Spirit Fire with their blood.

289
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,550
They've safeguarded
the Celestial Palace's prosperity,

290
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:26,620
and in return gained abilities beyond ordinary cultivators.

291
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,610
Several of them even ascended to godhood...

292
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:30,970
Sima Jiao!

293
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,620
It's me.

294
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,000
Why that look?

295
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:39,780
I just never thought
I'd be using video calls here.

296
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,130
Video...

297
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,990
What's a video call?

298
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:49,880
It's when we're in different places, but can still see each other
and hear each other talk.

299
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,630
So, the Demon Realm
also has Transvision Mirrors?

300
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,450
You can say that.

301
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,600
But we don't call it Transvision Mirror.

302
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,680
We call it a cell phone.

303
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,200
You're amazing.

304
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,800
I casually mentioned live streaming, and you made it real.

305
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:09,740
With this mirror, I can remind you...

306
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:13,490
I'm always there for you.

307
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:18,120
If you want me to miss you, just say so.

308
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,850
No need to dress it up like that.

309
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:22,930
Forget Sima Jiao.

310
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:25,560
You're more like Sima Proud-Heart.

311
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,600
You said you wanted live streaming, so I visited Three Saints Mountain.

312
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:38,310
Oh, the tower and palaces are being rebuilt!

313
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,810
Doesn't your invisibility have a time limit?

314
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:46,200
Be careful. Don't get caught.

315
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,640
Don't worry. I'm hidden by illusions.

316
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,580
I know what I'm doing.

317
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,620
Good, then.

318
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,200
Hold it higher! Higher!

319
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,310
I can't see what's there.

320
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,180
Sima Jiao?

321
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,290
Hello?

322
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,790
Hello?

323
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:16,820
Don't tell me the mirror's lost signal.

324
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:22,750
Search here for traces of the Spirit Fire.

325
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:26,000
Report at once if you find anything.

326
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,880
Hello?

327
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,100
Why's the picture frozen?

328
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:40,150
I nearly got caught by the teacher.

329
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,120
This place is like that.

330
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,970
Nothing alive here.

331
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:47,500
You're looking for the Spirit Fire?

332
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,990
Find anything?

333
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,720
Not yet.

334
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,510
Forget about it.

335
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:57,000
If you like, just enjoy the scenery.

336
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,550
 Good thing I was raised on Grandmaster's blood. 

337
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:08,710
 I know his aura well. 

338
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:12,620
 Maybe I can find him and Ting Yan soon. 

339
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,450
Ru Ling?

340
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:24,240
Ru Ling's calling me.

341
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:35,380
Ru Ling!

342
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,440
Ru Ling!

343
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,880
Ru Ling, why call me back in such a rush?

344
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,470
Did you run into trouble?

345
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,560
Or did someone bully you?

346
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,860
 Nian Jiu, I had no choice. 

347
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,640
 Please forgive me. 

348
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:00,800
Ru Ling, you called me back just for this?

349
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:29,380
Ru Ling.

350
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:32,920
Why betray Grandmaster?

351
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,120
Sima Jiao has killed countless.
He deserves to die.

352
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,470
This isn't betrayal. It's justice!

353
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:43,380
Ru Ling, tell me...

354
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,310
Have they deceived you?

355
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,890
Grandmaster is not that kind of man.

356
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:49,580
Silence!

357
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:56,100
Do you realize I can kill you right here?

358
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,970
I'm just a serpent by nature.

359
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:04,710
You gave me the chance to take human form.

360
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:07,480
This life is yours to begin with.

361
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,900
If you want it back today,

362
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,660
then take it.

363
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:23,830
I know this hurts you.

364
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,550
But bear it for now.

365
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:32,220
Word has spread that you're imprisoned.

366
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:39,100
I'm sure Sima Jiao
will come for you once he knows.

367
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,960
There's someone spying on us.

368
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,990
Bite me, then use Breath-Sealing.

369
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:50,060
I'll let you escape.

370
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,400
Nian Jiu, we were once master and disciple.

371
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,680
Why throw your life away like this?

372
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,030
You killed him so easily.

373
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:23,860
Madam Ye, you're so ruthless!

374
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,750
You saw it, Sect Master Shi.

375
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,790
This beast caused trouble.

376
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:31,110
I had no choice but to put him down.

377
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,790
But...

378
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:41,790
we'll have to try another way to get news.

379
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,490
Rest easy.

380
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,630
I have my methods.

381
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:51,720
Guards! Drag him out.

382
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,820
Got bullied again?

383
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,440
Grandmaster.

384
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,270
Grandmaster!

385
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:31,400
I was wrong.

386
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:37,440
Grandmaster, in Yin Palace, I learned someone is hunting for your trail.

387
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,530
Thankfully Ru Ling helped me slip away.

388
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:53,400
This... It's a tracking spell!

389
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,520
I've been tricked!

390
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:58,230
Why else would Shi Qian Lv let you go?

391
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:01,960
So, they used me to get to you.

392
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:06,710
Grandmaster, for bringing you such trouble,

393
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:08,450
I deserve to die.

394
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:09,550
No more nonsense.

395
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,070
Move.

396
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,140
Grandmaster, there's an array!

397
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,610
No point hiding.

398
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,290
Show yourself.

399
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:41,730
Forgive us, Grandmaster.

400
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,340
Even wounded as I am,

401
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:01,890
your tricks are far too weak.

402
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:18,240
Grandmaster! Did you suffer a serious wound before, and still not heal?

403
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:27,510
Go tell your master this.

404
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,680
"Sima Jiao never fought us."

405
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,720
"Once he broke out of the array,
we lost track of him."

406
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,130
Why did you let them go?

407
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:46,750
Those puppets can sense
the Sima bloodline within Shi territory

408
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:49,180
and seek out the Spirit Fire.

409
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,230
They are also the torches I've chosen.

410
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:57,480
When the time is right, they will ignite the hidden fire I planted,

411
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,760
to complete the final step of my plan.

412
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:09,840
This must be kept secret from Ye Ru Ling.

413
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,180
Understood.

414
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,960
How was the tracking spell broken?

415
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,030
It was my failure.

416
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:22,900
I could only watch as Sima Jiao undid both the array and the tracking spell,
then vanished.

417
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,550
And he didn't see you?

418
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:29,740
No, we kept hidden, never fought him.

419
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,180
I'm off.

420
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,230
How did he escape?

421
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:46,880
Zhen Xu, I sent you to investigate Ri Gui.

422
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,530
Any leads?

423
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:51,260
Nothing suspicious so far.

424
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:58,400
Now go check if there's a spy among us.

425
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,800
Understood.

426
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:48,470
Too much live streaming gets boring anyway.

427
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:51,190
Why aren't you back yet?

428
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:02,470
What's going on?

429
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:06,780
Did I mess up
from learning too many spells lately?

430
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:11,260
I'll check some books.

431
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:18,360
What do you want to look up? I can teach you.

432
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,650
So, you finally came back.

433
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:33,290
What were you drawing just now?

434
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,970
This is called an emoticon.

435
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:40,510
My personal code.

436
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:42,170
Cute, huh?

437
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,800
It's so late.

438
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,880
Why aren't you asleep?

439
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,030
What are you so smug about?

440
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,070
I wasn't waiting for you.

441
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:09,150
While you were gone,
I went to classes, I hung out,

442
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,880
and I bought snacks, clothes, furniture.

443
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,610
I was living fine...

444
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:39,380
Don't worry.

445
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,760
These days won't last much longer.

446
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:49,380
If you're not well,
don't push yourself so hard.

447
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,800
No need to worry about me.

448
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:05,880
Tomorrow, I'll stay here a while longer.

449
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:38,820
You really won't go out?

450
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,550
 Is it to keep me company? 

451
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:43,670
Do you like crowds?

452
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:48,190
In a few days, it'll be the liveliest time Gengchen Celestial Palace has seen.

453
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:51,470
Some kind of festival?

454
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:54,140
 Don't tell me it's a date. 

455
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:57,010
 My heart's already racing. 

456
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,650
Not a festival.

457
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:05,520
But I'll make it something worth remembering.

458
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:11,090
Oh, so it's business after all.

459
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:14,020
 There goes my little heart, crushed. 

460
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:24,130
Didn't you say only when I'm worked up you can hear my thoughts?

461
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:27,520
And you think you weren't worked up just now?

462
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,740
What's wrong?

463
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,670
Mad at me?

464
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,620
This person is now asleep.

465
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,280
Please leave a message after the beep.

466
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,010
Beep.

467
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,800
You laugh way too easily!

468
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:00,420
You're finally back,
and all you do is tease me.

469
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:06,300
Then tell me, what do you like most?

470
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,780
Fish time. (Slacking)

471
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,340
What office drone doesn't?

472
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:17,000
Bet you don't even know what it means.

473
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:21,750
Who says I don't?

474
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:26,543
 

475
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:36,360
Go ahead.

476
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,220
What do you mean?

477
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,270
You said you love fish time.

478
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:49,030
All this trouble... just to fish?

479
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,920
I'm not going.

480
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,070
Why not?

481
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:53,670
The fish here are the best.

482
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:58,940
But diving in to catch them is too much work.

483
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,700
Not a problem.

484
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,700
Now it's yours.

485
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:40,080


486
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:55,000
song title

487
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,080
 ♫ Autumn winds sigh ♫ 

488
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,200
 ♫ Moon and stars dapple the sky ♫ 

489
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,040
 ♫ Brushing the loneliness of bygone days ♫ 

490
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,200
 ♫ Candlelight flickers low ♫ 

491
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,140
 ♫ Shadows sway ♫ 

492
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:11,100
 ♫ Shimmering in the night ♫ 

493
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,080
 ♫ With a brush I draw ♫ 

494
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,040
 ♫ The color of light ♫ 

495
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:19,040
 ♫ To warm your frozen soul ♫ 

496
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,080
 ♫ Memories anchor here ♫ 

497
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,040
 ♫ Longing is engraved ♫ 

498
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,440
 ♫ Yet cannot be touched ♫ 

499
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,760
 ♫ Following ♫ 

500
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,160
 ♫ The veins of gravel ♫ 

501
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:35,080
 ♫ I turn into spirit fire ♫ 

502
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,860
 ♫ Burning away ♫ 

503
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:41,860
 ♫ All these karmic ties ♫ 

504
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:45,140
 ♫ To save you ♫ 

505
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,180
 ♫ To save me ♫ 

506
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:51,060
 ♫ To cross over all suffering,
I'll break through ♫ 

507
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,200
 ♫ The laws of heaven ♫ 

508
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,100
 ♫ The vortex of reincarnation ♫ 

509
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:59,160
 ♫ What of life and death? ♫ 

510
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,160
 ♫ To save you ♫ 

511
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,120
 ♫ To save me ♫ 

512
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:07,000
 ♫ To redeem all beings, I'll let pass ♫ 

513
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,140
 ♫ Right and wrong ♫ 

514
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:11,120
 ♫ Rumors and tales ♫ 

515
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,640
 ♫ To seize fate ♫ 

516
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:18,440
 ♫ With my own hands ♫ 

517
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:21,140
 ♫ For you ♫ 

518
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,200
 ♫ For me ♫ 

519
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,160
 ♫ For the healing of wounds ♫ 

520
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,180
 ♫ I'll stir the murky seas ♫ 

521
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,160
 ♫ And strive against the heavens ♫ 

522
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:35,060
 ♫ To protect the vastness ♫ 

523
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:37,140
 ♫ For you ♫ 

524
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,220
 ♫ For me ♫ 

525
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:43,060
 ♫ For the light of dawn ♫ 

526
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:45,160
 ♫ I'll face promises ♫ 

527
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,120
 ♫ Like a moth to a flame ♫ 

528
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:52,840
 ♫ And use my body to shine ♫ 

529
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:59,420
 ♫ On even more ♫
