00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,500
 ♫ Heavens strike with thunderous wrath ♫ 

2
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,420
 ♫ Mountains and rivers shatter before my eyes ♫ 

3
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,780
 ♫ Endless splendor
cultivated through lifetimes ♫ 

4
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,380
 ♫ Turns to dust between my fingers
in an instant ♫ 

5
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,220
 ♫ When the line
between good and evil is clear ♫ 

6
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,340
 ♫ Countless souls drift
into the boundless wilds ♫ 

7
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,500
 ♫ Carrying the spirit fire forward ♫ 

8
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,580
 ♫ I defy fate ♫ 

9
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,100
 ♫ Just to remain by your side ♫ 

10
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,900
 ♫ Falling into love's abyss ♫ 

11
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,780
 ♫ Like heavy rain pouring down ♫ 

12
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:08,460
 ♫ Drunk on romance ♫ 

13
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,460
 ♫ In a blink, love and hate
vanish into illusion ♫ 

14
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:16,300
 ♫ Falling into endless love ♫ 

15
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,500
 ♫ Stirring waves upending a lifetime ♫ 

16
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,660
 ♫ Even if this life leads to ruin ♫ 

17
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:27,020
 ♫ I still choose to be entangled with you ♫ 

18
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,125
 ♫ Through all lifetimes ♫ 

19
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:36,645
 

20
00:01:36,645 --> 00:01:39,440
 

21
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,240
Grandmaster.

22
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,110
Grandmaster, are you all right?

23
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:52,170
Is the Spirit Fire inside you restless again?

24
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,740
Have you found Shi Qian Lv?

25
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,270
He... He escaped.

26
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,220
Then why are you back here?

27
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,740
Grandmaster, look.

28
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,040
Ye Ru Ling?

29
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,930
She was Hong Luo,

30
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:25,490
the girl killed by those two
from the Zhihun clan.

31
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,830
So, she ended up in the Demon Realm as well.

32
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:34,140
Grandmaster, have you heard?

33
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,150
The people at Rouge Terrace said

34
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,210
they found her by Yin-Yang Lake.

35
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,710
And they told me

36
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:47,050
she was carrying the tube whistle I gave her.

37
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,320
Grandmaster, I finally got word of her,

38
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,020
but then I instantly lost her again.

39
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:01,580
Does this mean I will never see her again?

40
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,890
Her soul has been transferred.

41
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,050
You guarded the rite.

42
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,740
Really?

43
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:25,200
When I stood guard over the Soul Transfer,

44
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,760
all I found was a handful of ashes.

45
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,450
I never knew

46
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,100
that was her.

47
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,770
But...

48
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,990
don't be too quick to rejoice.

49
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,990
When I performed
the Soul Transfer Spell for her,

50
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:51,520
I found that her soul was badly damaged.

51
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,420
The memories of when she was Ye Ru Ling

52
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,480
may never return.

53
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,020
Grandmaster, are you saying

54
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:07,100
that she may not remember me?

55
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,140
She may even treat your devotion

56
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,740
as nothing,

57
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,120
leaving you in pain.

58
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,370
Even though none of this has happened yet,

59
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,540
your words already make my heart ache.

60
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,490
As long as she remains alive,

61
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,420
no matter how much it hurts you,

62
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,690
you must endure it.

63
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,220
You are right, Grandmaster.

64
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,740
What matters most

65
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,810
is that she remains alive.

66
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,460
Move it.

67
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,560
Keep up.

68
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,980
Hurry.

69
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,010
Move it!

70
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,860
Move!

71
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,640
- Keep up.
- Qian Lv.

72
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,880
People from the Demon Realm and Sima Jiao's men

73
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,360
are all looking for us.

74
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,560
- Hurry up!
- If Liao Ting Yan doesn't act soon,

75
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,860
are we just going to wait for death?

76
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,000
Avoid that squad of ghost envoys.

77
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,370
Hurry!

78
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,830
Greetings, Preceptor.

79
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,490
Routine inspection.

80
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,300
Who is in the carriage?

81
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,420
Qian Lv...

82
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,590
Go on.

83
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,930
Yes.

84
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,680
That man once held power
in the Celestial Palace.

85
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,790
He has some cunning.

86
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,000
But look at him now.

87
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,760
How laughable.

88
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,120
Preceptor, why did you let him go?

89
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,960
I've heard Liao Ting Yan
has called him Father these past 18 years,

90
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,490
believing he was her savior.

91
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,120
He's also the one who knows her history

92
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,120
in the Celestial Palace best.

93
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,710
I'm letting him live.

94
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,130
Perhaps one day he'll be of use to me.

95
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:20,010
But what if he doesn't repay the favor?

96
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,130
I don't need him to.

97
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,150
Once he is driven to a dead end,

98
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,340
he will swallow his pride.

99
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,440
Keep a close watch on him.

100
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,740
Understood.

101
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,470
We're lucky they didn't realize

102
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,420
we were from the Celestial Palace.

103
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:42,880
That was Ming Li,
the Preceptor of the Demon Realm.

104
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,680
With his cultivation,
he surely saw our true identity.

105
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,340
Then why did he let us go?

106
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:56,340
Perhaps he has an ulterior motive.

107
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,440
Hey, you.

108
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,740
Stop.

109
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,470
Why are you still here?

110
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:22,690
Your Grandmaster said I could stay.

111
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,960
Listen up.

112
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,200
You're only still alive

113
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,960
because our Grandmaster cares

114
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,680
about Ting Yan's feelings.

115
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,250
You should be keeping your head down.

116
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,290
How dare you strut around like this?

117
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,870
Listen.

118
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:45,370
From now on, you are not to appear
before Ting Yan again.

119
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,130
Fine.

120
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,160
But Yan loves the food I make.

121
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,320
If she can't have it, she'll grow restless

122
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,710
and have trouble sleeping.

123
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:59,290
If she falls ill because of this,
who will take responsibility?

124
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,490
Are you saying...

125
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,350
she can't do without you?

126
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,100
It seems that way.

127
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,920
You are too dangerous for her.

128
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,580
I'm staying by her side to shield her from you.

129
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,060
She and I are cultivation partners.

130
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:26,370
You are nothing but a clown.

131
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:44,980
Still, these do smell nice.

132
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,590
Don't flatter yourself.

133
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,110
This is nothing.

134
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,400
Our Grandmaster can get Ting Yan

135
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,100
whatever she wants to eat.

136
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,350
Grandmaster, even if you don't kill him,

137
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,460
you can't let him act so arrogantly.

138
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,530
Someone like him

139
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,580
is not worth my anger.

140
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,870
I won't take him seriously.

141
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,830
But, Grandmaster,

142
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,470
you don't really seem

143
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:26,060
like you're not angry.

144
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,410
Let's go.

145
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,280
Your spells are getting stronger.

146
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,510
Have you been practicing in secret?

147
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,350
- Of course not.
- Come on.

148
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,990
I know you love training.

149
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,800
Again.

150
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,610
Love it? I'm forced into it.

151
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,870
What?

152
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,860
Nothing. Let's keep going.

153
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,750
It's already dark.

154
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,350
Go back and rest.

155
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,750
I'll scout outside to see
if there are any gaps in the defenses

156
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,110
and prepare for our departure.

157
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,410
All right.

158
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,440
Why doesn't Feng Qi listen?

159
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,280
I told him to leave, but he just won't.

160
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,060
Every day, he drags me to train
like he's on stimulants.

161
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,980
I only train for self-defense,
not because I like it.

162
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,630
When did you come in?

163
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,530
Let me take you somewhere.

164
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:19,250
 Why can't I ever say no to him? 

165
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:56,888
 

166
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:12,220
Why does it feel like I've been here before?

167
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,060
You remember?

168
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,820
No.

169
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:25,490
I just feel like I saw it in a dream.

170
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,250
That was no dream.

171
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:38,060
This is where we first met.

172
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,220
 I'm exhausted. 

173
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,080
 Can't walk anymore? 

174
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,230
 Grandmaster, forgive me for asking, 

175
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:00,680
 but why are we climbing so high? 

176
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,100
 No reason. 

177
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,350
Back then, when you climbed these stairs,

178
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:08,200
you nearly collapsed.

179
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,010
I had never met anyone weaker than you.

180
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,490
Even the snake I kept

181
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,900
was a hundred times stronger.

182
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:22,100
 ♫ No fate's tangle, no parting swans ♫ 

183
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,400
 ♫ Memories fade ♫ 

184
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,830
But now you can climb them

185
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,610
without feeling tired.

186
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,830
At the Soulbud stage,

187
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:37,220
several flights of stairs are nothing to me.

188
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:45,460
But I know that even if you can climb them,
you don't like doing it.

189
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,740
 ♫ Even if heaven and earth turned to ash ♫ 

190
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:52,580
 ♫ I would never regret the day I met you ♫ 

191
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:59,500
 ♫ Mad love blooms a lotus in the heart ♫ 

192
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:18,020
 ♫ Snow not gone, flame not out ♫ 

193
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,830
 ♫ Prism of three lifetimes ♫ 

194
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,100
You've always liked delicate things.

195
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:29,940
I put up these lanterns
after moving the tower here.

196
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,460
Do you like them?

197
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,990
In the Demon Realm, everything is practical.

198
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:40,220
It's rare to see something so beautiful.

199
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,770
If you like them,

200
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,980
I'll light them for you every day.

201
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,820
 ♫ We wander the mortal world in search ♫ 

202
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,900
 ♫ Yet forget the reason why ♫ 

203
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,500
 ♫ Cycle back to raging flames ♫ 

204
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,940
 ♫ Even if my very soul were to vanish ♫ 

205
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,940
 ♫ Be it destiny or doom,
I light up the endless night ♫ 

206
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,860
 ♫ To chase the darkness away from your dreams ♫ 

207
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,000
 ♫ Even if heaven and earth turned to ash ♫ 

208
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,010
This is so beautiful.

209
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:17,130
Like a sky full of stars.

210
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,460
You like watching the stars?

211
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,830
This is breathtaking.

212
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,410
It's been so long
since I last saw a meteor shower.

213
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,410
This tower is perfect for stargazing.

214
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,630
It once stood on Three Saints Mountain.

215
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,870
I moved it here.

216
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,130
You must really like it.

217
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,460
I hate it.

218
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,230
It imprisoned me for 500 years.

219
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,810
500 years?

220
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:11,270
Then why did you bring it here?

221
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,700
Because we once lived here.

222
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,460
It carries your aura.

223
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:23,180
 I nearly forgot. I'm only a substitute. 

224
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:27,810
 None of this is really for me. 

225
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:57,330
Is something missing here?

226
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,230
I'll kill you!

227
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,360
So what if your cultivation partner died?

228
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,880
Yes, my power caused her death,
but I didn't kill her!

229
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,270
You were the fool who schemed against others

230
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,440
and ended up burning her to death by accident!

231
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,160
You keep blaming me.

232
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,140
Even if you feel nothing, I suffer!

233
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,770
You huge jerk! You scum!

234
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,750
 Why does this flame curse just like me? 

235
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,880
Shut up.

236
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,420
You brought her back?

237
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:44,120
I once had you water it

238
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,250
so it would produce Bloodseal Blooms,

239
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,490
and you taught it to talk this way.

240
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,840
 You vile, wicked woman! 

241
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,710
 How could you still water me
after learning the truth? 

242
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:57,880
 You're just a petty little evil flame. 

243
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,680
 Of course I'd choose to obey
the far more terrifying Grandmaster. 

244
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,790
So, this is the famed Bloodseal Bloom.

245
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,530
I taught it?

246
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:29,010
 These loungers are exactly my style. 

247
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,940
You really know how to enjoy yourself.

248
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,530
You taught me this.

249
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,460
 So, the body's original owner
used facial masks too? 

250
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,550
I haven't had time

251
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:06,790
to put on a mask and relax like this in years.

252
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,490
 What's the point of it? 

253
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,330
 It keeps the skin moisturized. 

254
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,990
When you were gone,

255
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,180
I once came here alone.

256
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,140
And somehow,

257
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,380
the past ten-odd years felt

258
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:32,850
even longer than the 500 years
in Three Saints Mountain.

259
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,600
 Don't be fooled. 

260
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,380
 He isn't doing any of this for you. 

261
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,700
We once shared

262
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,180
countless memories here.

263
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,460
They are real.

264
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,140
Unchanging.

265
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,010
And will never fade.

266
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,250
The truth is,
I am not the Liao Ting Yan you speak of.

267
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,530
We went through life and death together.

268
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,330
How could I mistake you?

269
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,960
But none of that matters.

270
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,850
You can treat today

271
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,850
as our first encounter.

272
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,490
From now on,

273
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,700
I will create new memories for us,

274
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:10,420
memories that belong only to the present.

275
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,490
Will you allow it?

276
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,140
Then this first meeting of ours,
filled with lanterns and stars,

277
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,050
is quite romantic.

278
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,880
Other wounds, no matter how grave,

279
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,120
always heal under my treatment.

280
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,900
Why is it so hard with yours?

281
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,100
The more you gain,
the greater the price you must pay.

282
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,400
 ♫ Heavens strike with thunderous wrath... ♫ 

283
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,770
All right.

284
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,740
I had meant it as a gift for our first meeting.

285
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:14,140
 ♫ Endless splendor
cultivated through lifetimes ♫ 

286
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:18,660
 ♫ Turns to dust between my fingers
in an instant ♫ 

287
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:22,300
 ♫ When the line
between good and evil is clear ♫ 

288
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:26,380
 ♫ Countless souls drift
into the boundless wilds ♫ 

289
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,940
 ♫ Carrying the spirit fire forward ♫ 

290
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:35,500
 ♫ I defy fate just to remain by your side ♫ 

291
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:40,140
 ♫ Falling into love's abyss like heavy rain ♫ 

292
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,660
 ♫ Pouring down ♫ 

293
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,140
 Grandmaster, 

294
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,270
 I tied it in a bow. 

295
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:52,220
 Isn't it cute? 

296
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,900
 ♫ Upending a lifetime ♫ 

297
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,980
 ♫ Even if this life leads to ruin ♫ 

298
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:05,460
 ♫ I still choose to be entangled with you ♫ 

299
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:09,460
 ♫ Through all lifetimes ♫ 

300
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,510
Any sign of Shi Qian Lv?

301
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:16,230
My Lord, one of our men
sent word that he saw him,

302
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,640
but by the time we got here,

303
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,700
all we found was this empty carriage.

304
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,380
He really was here.

305
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,200
He's over there.

306
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,880
- After him!
- Yes.

307
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,180
Let's go!

308
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,990
Qian Lv...

309
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,200
- Well?
- They're coming.

310
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,310
What do we do?

311
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,740
Already?

312
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,230
Run.

313
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,310
Qian Lv!

314
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:00,050
- Your legs...
- Run, now!

315
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,030
Shi Qian Lv, you cannot escape.

316
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,470
They say you were crippled.

317
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:14,700
But now it seems you lied to Ting Yan.

318
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,090
Enough talk!

319
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,420
Qian Lv, go!

320
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,550
Keep chasing him.

321
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,230
I'll bring this one back to the Grandmaster.

322
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,380
Understood.

323
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:16,620
I actually slept
all the way till morning again.

324
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,010
 If you like them, 

325
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,700
 I'll light them for you every day. 

326
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:50,140
Why is my face so hot?

327
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,700
Have I really fallen for Sima Jiao?

328
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,550
Yan, may I come in?

329
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,940
Come in.

330
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,570
Thank you.

331
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:14,920
I saw everything.

332
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,640
Sima Jiao really was laughable,

333
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,070
thinking he could win you over
with tricks like that.

334
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:22,290
He's really underestimated you.

335
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,180
In fact,

336
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,550
he is very kind to me.

337
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:33,030
He treats you well
because of the woman he once loved.

338
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,270
It has nothing to do with you.

339
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:36,270
You said so yourself. Remember?

340
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,680
Those lanterns and that tower

341
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,990
have nothing to do with you.

342
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,740
Don't get confused.

343
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,180
Enough. I know.

344
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:52,160
I feel like I'm the other woman right now.

345
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,620
His feelings aren't really for me.

346
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,940
Yan, in fact, we...

347
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,900
I want to take you to see someone.

348
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,810
- Aunt!
- Don't call me that!

349
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:18,470
Our clan has no traitor like you!

350
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:21,980
How dare you speak such nonsense
in front of me?

351
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,850
Please, calm down.

352
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,750
Free her first, will you?

353
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,420
I will let you see for yourself

354
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,740
how the Shi clan deceived you.

355
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,360
You wicked girl.

356
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,920
You killed your own brother.

357
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,710
And now, are you going
to watch me die for you too?

358
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:48,140
You should kill him now!

359
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,230
I'll cooperate.

360
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,050
But promise me this.

361
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,940
No matter what happens, don't harm her.

362
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,180
Very well.

363
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,980
I promise.

364
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:15,760
 Sima Jiao, you vile man! 

365
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,320
 Let me go! Let my father go! 

366
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,770
 Sima Jiao! 

367
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,620
How could this be?

368
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,880
 - Yan.
- Zhen Xu. 

369
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,090
 Come on. 

370
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:00,470
 Let's go. Come with me. 

371
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,270
 But Father... 

372
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,360
 Don't worry about him. 

373
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,990
 I'll take care of it. Go now. 

374
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,840
 Leave this to me. Go! 

375
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,090
 I... 

376
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,990
 Zhen Xu! 

377
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:17,600
 Just leave me. 

378
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,160
 Go! 

379
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:23,850
 Remember. Kill Sima Jiao to avenge our clan. 

380
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,380
 Zhen Xu! 

381
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,250
Ting Yan...

382
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,090
She's using...

383
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,980
Father's energy to heal my wounds?

384
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,330
 He would even shorten his own life for me... 

385
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:27,230
Someone tampered with her memories.

386
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:29,360
But weren't you the one

387
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,660
who showed me all that?

388
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,530
Aunt!

389
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:54,700
You promised not to hurt her.

390
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,270
When I performed Soul Search,

391
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,290
I shielded her soul.

392
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,090
I didn't hurt her.

393
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,230
My mind is a mess.

394
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,400
Give me time to think.

395
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,310
- Ting Yan...
- I am not your Liao Ting Yan!

396
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:16,380
And I don't want to be her!

397
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:26,600
You only need to be yourself.

398
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,490
You don't even know who I really am.

399
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,570
I do.

400
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,510
You like vacations.

401
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,180
You like touching fish.

402
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:41,620
And you hate killing most of all.

403
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,620
 You're courting death! 

404
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:53,770
Ting Yan!

405
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,250
Ting Yan!

406
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,140
Qian Du.

407
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,140
Please forgive me.

408
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:31,370
I never thought it would come to this,

409
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:37,450
using your life to buy myself one last chance.

410
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:43,150
 Qian Lv, we are already at the end of the road. 

411
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:46,360
 I am willing to give my life
to win a chance for the Shi clan's revenge. 

412
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,070
 Absolutely not. 

413
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:51,760
 If you appear before Sima Jiao,
you will surely die. 

414
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,720
 Besides, we still have 

415
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,470
 Liao Ting Yan as a piece on the board. 

416
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:57,070
 If Liao Ting Yan ever meant to strike, 

417
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:59,590
 would she have waited until now? 

418
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,630
 If I am captured and brought before Sima Jiao, 

419
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,590
 he will certainly use Soul Search on me 

420
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:05,990
 to prove himself to her. 

421
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:08,240
 You can implant the memories we want her to see 

422
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,400
 into my Soul Manor. 

423
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,280
 Once she has seen them, I will end my own life, 

424
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,700
 and her hatred for Sima Jiao
will be completely awakened. 

425
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,500
 But... 

426
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,720
 Qian Lv, we have no time left. 

427
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,930
 They are closing in. 

428
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:36,470
 Let me bid you farewell here. 

429
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:39,110
 When the Shi clan's vengeance is fulfilled, 

430
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:43,210
 please let the winds carry word of it to me. 

431
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:19,770
Sima Jiao, you will die at the hands
of the one you love most.

432
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,920
Grandmaster, Senior Sister Ting Yan is fine.

433
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,110
But she seems to have been forcibly subjected
to repeated marrow cleansing.

434
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:40,670
Her Soul Manor has been badly damaged,

435
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,760
which is why she fainted when her emotions

436
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,440
became unstable.

437
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,320
As her cultivation partner,

438
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,470
you may try to enter her Soul Manor

439
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,290
and repair it yourself.

440
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:53,410
She has not accepted me yet.

441
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,770
Forcing my way into her Soul Manor
would only hurt her.

442
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,240
Use my blood to heal her.

443
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,760
Grandmaster, your wounds are already

444
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,880
harder to heal than before.

445
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,850
If you draw your blood directly...

446
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,760
With her spirit veins blocked,

447
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,360
using raw blood might cause backlash.

448
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,110
It must be refined into a pill.

449
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:21,030
I've heard there are skilled alchemists
in Winter City.

450
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,590
Perhaps I can seek their aid.

451
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:26,190
I will summon every alchemist in the city.

452
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,960
The pill must be made,

453
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,620
but see to it that it is not bitter.

454
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,890
Understood.

455
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,180
Nian Jiu.

456
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,990
Have you arranged the search for Shi Qian Lv?

457
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:45,070
All preparations are complete.

458
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:47,360
We can depart at any time.

459
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,470
Then go now.

460
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,920
Yes.

461
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,400
By the way, Grandmaster,
while searching for him,

462
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,290
we could also seize
the southwest of the Demon Realm.

463
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,190
The three cities there

464
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:01,020
have no intention of surrendering.

465
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,890
Don't waste lives needlessly.

466
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,620
Grandmaster, you care
about other people's lives now.

467
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,970
Grandmaster, before I go,
I have one more request.

468
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:23,140
When Hong Luo is reborn,
I will send word to you.

469
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,500
Thank you, Grandmaster.

470
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,660
 Where am I? 

471
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,410
 Could this be the legendary Soul Manor? 

472
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,670
 But my body's original owner is dead. 

473
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,810
 There shouldn't be a Soul Manor at all. 

474
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,960
 No... 

475
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,410
 This seems to be my Soul Manor. 

476
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,280
Why does this flower

477
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,330
look so much like Sima Jiao's Bloodseal Bloom?

478
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:41,970
Liao Ting Yan!

479
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,370
Zhen Xu?

480
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,410
I'm out.

481
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,370
Ting Yan!

482
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,290
Ting Yan!

483
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,440
I'm back!

484
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,740
Hong Luo!

485
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,630
Why are you a child?

486
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,510
I've grown quickly.

487
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:25,630
Truth is, I've only been alive
three or four days.

488
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,760
If not for all the spirit medicines

489
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,630
poured on me since the Soul Transfer,

490
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,590
I'd still be a newborn now.

491
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,670
Why did you just now call me Ting Yan,

492
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:34,920
like Sima Jiao does?

493
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,880
Did I?

494
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,760
It must have been instinct.

495
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,360
Since my rebirth,

496
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,240
strange visions keep surfacing in my mind.

497
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,670
I see you, me,

498
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:49,220
even Sima Jiao, and that City Lord,
the Black Serpent.

499
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:53,670
But I have no memory
of living through any of them.

500
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:56,030
Anyway, I heard

501
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:59,960
it was you who asked Sima Jiao
to perform the Soul Transfer for me.

502
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,630
Why would you do that?

503
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,760
Aren't you two supposed to be enemies?

504
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,910
That's a long story.

505
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:10,590
So, you and your enemy, Sima Jiao,

506
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:12,440
once fell in love, and now you've reunited.

507
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,440
He says your father deceived you,

508
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,360
but your father says Sima Jiao deceived you.

509
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:22,070
Then, in a conflict,
Sima Jiao killed your aunt.

510
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:24,320
But when I accidentally entered my Soul Manor,

511
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,880
I felt something was off.

512
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,360
You actually entered your Soul Manor?

513
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,510
They say fragments
of past memories appear there.

514
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:33,240
What did you see?

515
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:38,580
I saw that the one
who killed my brother wasn't Sima Jiao.

516
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:43,030
- It was me.
- What?

517
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:47,510
Why would such a memory
appear in your Soul Manor?

518
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:50,840
Could it really be, as Sima Jiao said,

519
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,470
that you are Liao Ting Yan

520
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:55,470
but have only lost that part of your memory?

521
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:58,400
That is exactly what baffles me.

522
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,190
If what I saw in my Soul Manor was true,

523
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:03,970
then my aunt's memories were false.

524
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,150
Besides, if Sima Jiao had something to hide,

525
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,630
he wouldn't have insisted
on taking me to search for my aunt's soul.

526
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:15,500
So, you suspect your father
has been lying to you all along?
