song title

3
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:28,780
 ♫ Heavens strike with thunderous wrath ♫ 

4
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:32,420
 ♫ Mountains and rivers shatter before my eyes ♫ 

5
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,680
 ♫ Endless splendor
cultivated through lifetimes ♫ 

6
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,430
 ♫ Turns to dust between my fingers
in an instant ♫ 

7
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,220
 ♫ When the line
between good and evil is clear ♫ 

8
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,240
 ♫ Countless souls drift
into the boundless wilds ♫ 

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,700
 ♫ Carrying the spirit fire forward ♫ 

10
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,880
♫  I defy fate just to remain by your side  ♫

11
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,860
 ♫ Falling into love's abyss ♫ 

12
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,760
 ♫ Like heavy rain pouring down ♫ 

13
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,560
 ♫ Drunk on romance ♫ 

14
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,220
 ♫ In a blink, love and hate
vanish into illusion ♫ 

15
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,300
 ♫ Falling into endless love ♫ 

16
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,520
 ♫ Stirring waves upending a lifetime ♫ 

17
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,660
 ♫ Even if this life leads to ruin ♫ 

18
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:26,000
 ♫ I still choose to be entangled with you ♫ 

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,125
 ♫ Through all lifetimes ♫ 

20
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:36,540
 

21
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,720
 

22
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,000
But why is there the Fengshan bloodline here?

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,920
The Fengshan Clan has always
pursued bloodline purity.

24
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,750
But over the years, some have defied their elders, run off,

25
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,570
and had children with outsiders.

26
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,190
Shi Qian Lv has gone to great lengths
to gather people of the Fengshan bloodline.

27
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,390
He is playing a long game.

28
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:12,140
But what could Shi Qian Lv possibly do with those people?

29
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,970
It's for his own selfish desires.

30
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,660
I told you before.

31
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,270
People in Gengchen Celestial Palace
are all the same.

32
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,090
They will do anything for cultivation.

33
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,970
Right now, we just need to find out where the Shi family took those children,

34
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,240
and we will know his true motives.

35
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,420
But the only one
who knows about this is Master Yan.

36
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,830
We have no choice but to wait for his return.

37
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,110
After all, no one even knows where he is.

38
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,920
Why wait?

39
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,740
He will come back to me of his own will.

40
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,660
Please elaborate, Grandmaster.

41
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:57,600
I will ruin the Yan Residence in Yan Huan's disguise,

42
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,360
and that old man
will have no choice but to return.

43
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,210
How does it feel to be used as a breeding vessel,

44
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,340
living in constant manipulation?

45
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,100
Am I really living at all?

46
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:51,090
Even when I pretended to be a wastrel
lost in wine and women,

47
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,380
my family still refused to leave me alone.

48
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:59,930
Living such a miserable life, I might as well be dead.

49
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,890
I'm nothing more than a walking corpse.

50
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:17,570
You would rather live in disgrace than die with dignity?

51
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:21,090
Easy for you to say.

52
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,550
I wanted to end it all, too,

53
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:30,060
but it's not that easy to take my own life.

54
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,060
You haven't been through what I have.

55
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,520
You won't understand.

56
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,200
Once everything is over,

57
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,530
I will end it for you.

58
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,310
Then that would be best.

59
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:16,080
So, the Grandmaster wants to
cause unrest in the Yan family

60
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,490
to lure Master Yan back early?

61
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,930
He makes the plans, and I carry them out.

62
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,730
This is a big project.

63
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:29,390
I don't think we'll be able to shop and snack like this again anytime soon.

64
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:35,030
Ting Yan, you are starting to use words I don't understand again.

65
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,120
Never mind.

66
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,830
Those accessories look great! Come on.

67
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,590
What do you think?

68
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,620
I'll try another one.

69
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:54,790
This one's nice.

70
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,730
Really?

71
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,400
Is that Ye Ru Ling?

72
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,170
- Why is she here?
- Let me see. How about this one?

73
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:06,430
The woman next to her looks like... Liao Ting Yan!

74
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,370
Isn't Liao Ting Yan already dead?

75
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,520
Let's take a closer look.

76
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:15,740
Between these two, which should I choose?

77
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,690
What is it? What are you looking at?

78
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:26,440
Nothing. Ting Yan, this hairpin is very pretty.

79
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,820
I really like it. Help me pick some more.

80
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,820
I will be right back.

81
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,200
Oh no, he's from the Shi family.

82
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:56,440
Cang Lan? What are you doing here?

83
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,230
If I hadn't followed you in secret,

84
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:02,150
I doubt you would've ever told me that Liao Ting Yan was still alive.

85
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,210
You used a firefly to track me?

86
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:17,170
Cang Lan, don't do anything to Liao Ting Yan.

87
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,780
I'm sure there will be a way
to have the best of both worlds.

88
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:23,310
How can I count on someone as soft as you to save our people?

89
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,860
Ye Ru Ling, I'll go my own way from here.

90
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,310
Let's see who reaches the goal first.

91
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,180
- What are you doing? 
 - Keeping you in check.

92
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:39,470
Do you realize that
if Sima Jiao catches wind of this, both of us will end up losing everything?

93
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,120
Mr. Li, you're finally here.

94
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,680
This way.

95
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,330
We've been waiting for you.

96
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,565
 

97
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,520
Sir, you're here.

98
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,440
Go away.

99
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,440
Sir...

100
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,960
Stop!

101
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:27,320
- Sir...
- Go away...

102
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,710
What a weird man!

103
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,400
Young Master, maybe we've made a mistake.

104
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,240
Was that really not Liao Ting Yan?

105
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,790
Let's go.

106
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,830
That was close.

107
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,990
When did I turn into an otter?

108
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,190
Looks like the Grandmaster is here, too.

109
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,598
 

110
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,860
Grandmaster, did you step in
to protect me just now?

111
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,860
Did you get hurt?

112
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,080
No. Good thing you were there.

113
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,160
You turned me into an otter just in time,

114
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,960
or I would've been spotted and captured
by people from the Shi family.

115
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,660
What happened today feels off.

116
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,070
It seems someone has leaked your whereabouts.

117
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,710
Who was with you earlier?

118
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,770
I went out by myself.

119
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,450
Ru Ling was with me.

120
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,110
You're getting bolder and bolder.

121
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,710
Now you even dare to lie to me.

122
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:07,080
I was afraid you'd be suspicious of Ru Ling
if I told you the truth.

123
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,980
She is, after all, the Mistress of Yin Palace.

124
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,460
She could be colluding with the Shi family.

125
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:14,490
No, Ru Ling would never betray me.

126
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,830
I trust her.

127
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,980
Besides, nothing serious happened, right?

128
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,130
It's all been resolved now.

129
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,080
Nothing serious?

130
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,820
I saved your life. I gave you my blood.

131
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:28,470
If you're injured or in danger,
it wastes my blood.

132
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,710
So, the bottom line is
you don't want me wasting your blood, huh?

133
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,630
Rotten Sima Jiao.

134
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:44,420
Always trying to scare me.

135
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:52,780
By the way... If you're such a good liar, let's see how you're going to trick people now.

136
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:02,690
Sima Jiao, remove the Truth Spell now!

137
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:16,490
Mr. Yan, about Xian...

138
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,810
Hey, say something, will you?

139
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,920
I will find out where they are.

140
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,730
Thank you, sir.

141
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:32,280
Thank you for granting me freedom.

142
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,510
You're letting us go
because you understand our suffering, right?

143
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:41,780
I see today as the day of my rebirth, and I dressed up to welcome it.

144
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,350
That's great.

145
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:46,420
But this pink outfit
doesn't quite brighten you up.

146
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,700
Even when making small talk,
I blurt out my real thoughts.

147
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,340
It's so embarrassing.

148
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,730
How rude of you!

149
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,860
You're in no position to comment on my clothes.

150
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,430
I'm so sorry.

151
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:02,460
Grandmaster, could you please
remove the Truth Spell for me?

152
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,740
I know people in Chiyan City
are at lower realms and can't see the spell mark on my forehead,

153
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,130
but if I keep blurting out
whatever's on my mind, they're going to think I'm weird.

154
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:13,130
Maybe they'll even
beat me up one day, you know?

155
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,250
As I said, it's a punishment.

156
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,810
If someone's willing to save me the trouble
and give you a beating,

157
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:22,270
that wouldn't be such a bad thing.

158
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,410
What kind of schoolkid behavior is that?

159
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:29,150
So, you're pleased with what I did, since you called me a "schoolkid."

160
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,830
"Schoolkid" isn't a compliment.

161
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:35,950
It means you're childish,
petty, and ridiculous...

162
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,490
 Liao Ting Yan, shut your mouth already! 

163
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:42,940
At this point, you might as well keep going.

164
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,490
I wouldn't dare...

165
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,530
I said that because you made me.

166
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:53,220
If you remove the spell, I'll shower you with all the flattery you want.

167
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,010
Fake flattery is boring.

168
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:58,220
I have no interest in it.

169
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,520
Greetings, sir.

170
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,580
Sir, may I stay here?

171
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,860
I have no one else to rely on.

172
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,860
I'm willing to stay
and serve you day and night.

173
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,340
No need.

174
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,060
I'm not used to having someone around.

175
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,180
Isn't that right?

176
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,580
You seem pretty used to it to me.

177
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,360
You fell asleep with me
in your arms last night.

178
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,820
So, you sent us away
because of this young lady?

179
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,710
That's right.

180
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:28,520
She's the only one I want by my side.

181
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,940
Happy?

182
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,830
"Happy" isn't the word. More like shocked.

183
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,410
Where are you going with this?

184
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,460
This wasn't in the script.

185
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:44,230
I think you're so secretly delighted that you're starting to babble nonsense.

186
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,510
Lady, I'll tell you the truth.

187
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:52,490
I'm actually an otter, and he's not the real Mr. Yan. I...

188
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:56,930
What she means is that I no longer wish to be Young Master Yan,

189
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:00,110
and that I want to live by my own rules.

190
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,580
I get it.

191
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:05,140
I will forever pray for happiness
for you and the young lady.

192
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,555
See?

193
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:12,430
If you don't lift the spell, it'll backfire and ruin your grand plan.

194
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:15,060
I don't know about any "grand plan."

195
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:19,390
All I know is someone called me a schoolkid.

196
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,520
And the Truth Spell
will last another five days.

197
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,530
Are you cursing me in your head right now?

198
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,210
Yes.

199
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,000
Then I'll add another five days.

200
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:51,910
So, you're giving me a taste of my own medicine by trapping me here?

201
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:57,340
Stay here and reflect on what you did.

202
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,330
And stop thinking about parting ways with me.

203
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:07,260
I will find a way
to earn Sima Jiao's trust quickly.

204
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,510
I won't let our plan be hindered.

205
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,860
You'll find a way?

206
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,860
You've been in Chiyan City for days

207
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:19,400
and still haven't figured out how to activate Liao Ting Yan's extreme-cold nature, have you?

208
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,300
I've hit the mark, haven't I?

209
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,370
Ru Ling, stop fooling yourself.

210
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:34,000
At this point, our only option
is to take Liao Ting Yan's core.

211
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,700
There is another option.

212
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,230
Killing Sima Jiao.

213
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,290
Easier said than done.

214
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,060
Do you even realize what he's capable of?

215
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,710
You don't stand a chance.

216
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,810
An opportunity will come.

217
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:57,040
Ru Ling, please get your priorities straight.

218
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,880
Grandmaster.

219
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,410
Did you tell the Shi family
where Liao Ting Yan was?

220
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:24,940
I have never revealed a single word to anyone.

221
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:31,250
Then why did you come
to Chiyan City looking for us?

222
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,230
I was worried about Ting Yan's safety,

223
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:37,510
and I didn't believe you had truly killed her.

224
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:42,210
So, I resorted to using a firefly
to track her down.

225
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,610
Please forgive me, Grandmaster.

226
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:56,360
If I find out you have divided loyalties, I will kill you without hesitation.

227
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,360
I would not dare.

228
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,840
I wonder what Mr. Yan is up to today.

229
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,260
First, he dismissed all the concubines.

230
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,130
Then he ordered everyone
to take inventory of Master Yan's property.

231
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:19,100
It's pretty alarming.

232
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:24,810
Miss, I heard from a concubine
who left the residence that Mr. Yan was very fond of you.

233
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,640
We're both servants here.

234
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,440
- Could you put in a good word for a good lad?
- Good lad?

235
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,020
And help me become a steward or something?

236
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,130
If there's anything you need in the future, I'll help you, too.

237
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,820
Thank you, bro.

238
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,370
But judging by your looks,
you're more like my uncle.

239
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,340
I'm only in my early twenties.

240
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,580
I'm so sorry.

241
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:47,270
I saw your receding hairline and thought you were over 50...

242
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,160
Sorry, I mean no offense.

243
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,740
I'll let it slide for Mr. Yan's sake!

244
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,720
You're so rude!

245
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,790
Miss?

246
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,210
Sore throat?

247
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,890
Maybe you're just too tired. Get some rest.

248
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,760
I'll get back to work.

249
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,230
Can everyone please stop talking to me?

250
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:17,280
I've offended so many people in just one day.

251
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,790
Grandmaster.

252
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,820
What are you doing?

253
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,450
 Looks like it's working. 

254
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:42,920
 I don't have to worry anymore. 

255
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,240
 If I can't hear, I don't have to answer. 

256
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:48,790
Interesting, Liao Ting Yan.

257
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,070
Whether you praise me or scold me,

258
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:54,150
- I can't hear you.
- There's a pond behind you.

259
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:01,540
You don't actually think
this makes you look good, do you?

260
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,440
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

261
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,890
You're trying to mess with me.

262
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:14,740
I warned you there was a pond behind you.

263
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,170
You didn't listen.

264
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:18,450
What could I do?

265
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,970
You're going to such lengths
just to amuse me now.

266
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:26,780
And you've been putting a lot of effort into playing tricks
on me today, schoolkid.

267
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:29,650
If you want to keep this up, I'm all in.

268
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,340
So, do you?

269
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,820
No. Pull me up.

270
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,420
Let's go have some fun with the steward here.

271
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:20,150
Sir, Master Yan's belongings are all here.

272
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,840
Go to the bank and take all the money out.

273
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,740
Well...

274
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,750
And tell the servants outside

275
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,970
they can take whatever they want
from the chests in the courtyard.

276
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,650
Then they can leave the residence.

277
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:37,600
Sir, those are Master Yan's
most prized treasures.

278
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,080
I...

279
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,420
Understood.

280
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,210
 What is Mr. Yan trying to do? 

281
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,950
 I wonder where Master Yan is now. 

282
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:01,000
 This won't do. I must send someone
to get the news to him at once. 

283
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,730
 Hopefully, when he hears it,
he will hurry back. 

284
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:17,810
There are no jewels, gold,
or silver in these chests.

285
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,200
How come they're the most popular?

286
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,790
Miss, there's something you don't know.

287
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,680
People in this city are mostly at low realms,

288
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,960
but Master Yan is a great admirer
of immortal arts.

289
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,190
These are all magical artifacts
he has collected from all over the Celestial Palace.

290
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,070
- Magical artifacts?
- Yes.

291
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:34,860
Look. This is the Sound Channeler, and this is the Mirror of Reversal.

292
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,370
It can briefly reflect
the opponent's spells back at them.

293
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:40,130
This is a pair of Lovebond Plaques.

294
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:45,150
If you carve two people's names on them, the two will fall in love.

295
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,210
I've long been infatuated
with a pleasure house's top courtesan.

296
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:51,650
I plan to carve both our names on them.

297
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,160
The top courtesan?

298
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,860
I don't think you're worthy of her.

299
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,970
You... You've gone too far!

300
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:00,540
Sorry. I didn't mean to say that out loud.

301
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,740
I'll apologize.

302
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,930
When I apologize, I mean it, too!

303
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,060
I don't want to hear it!

304
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,300
When is Sima Jiao
going to lift the Truth Spell?

305
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,210
Mirror of Reversal?

306
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,010
Sima Jiao, we need to talk.

307
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,070
About what?

308
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:30,340
How much longer do you plan
to let the Truth Spell make a fool out of me?

309
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,410
Could you please remove it?

310
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:35,760
It's really causing serious trouble in my life.

311
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,780
Do you admit you were wrong?

312
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:43,730
Why did you lie to me in the first place?

313
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:45,500
I've already explained.

314
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,890
I had my reasons.

315
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,970
Why do you have to force me to tell the truth?

316
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,550
What's wrong with wanting a little privacy?

317
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,920
I can't even keep my own thoughts to myself.

318
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,900
It's really exhausting!

319
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,900
I can't stand empty pleasantries.

320
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,170

In this world,

330
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:58,770

You can't keep making me so uncomfortable

I'm doing this for fun?

What on earth did Sima Jiao mean by that?

Could it be that
he has romantic feelings for me?

No... Someone like him couldn't possibly fall for anyone, right?

Your tolerance is naturally different.

376
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,060
Did you prepare all this food for yourself?

377
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:44,790
Who else could it be?

378
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:51,500
Well, I prepared it to celebrate us freeing most of the people

Sleeping with my body pillow.

382

00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:07,070
 Have I become what she called a "hopeless romantic"?

Are you the only one from Serene Vale
who likes making up words and phrases?

00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:16,450
What does "dear" mean?

396
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:20,650
It's a polite, universal form of address.

397
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:23,940
I usually use it for people I'm close to.

398
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:28,040
But it can also be for
the most annoying clients.

What are you doing?

433
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:02,790
Grandmaster, the person
you want to kill is Mr. Yan?

434
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,450
What's wrong with that?

435
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:06,060
The news of a son's death

436
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,660
is probably the most effective way
to lure that old man back.

437
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,890
Can we not be so violent?

438
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:15,860
Can't we handle this a little more humanely?

439
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:20,650
For him, this would be a kind of release.

440
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:22,540
How can death be a release?

441
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,050
Isn't there another way?

442
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,480
Then what do you suggest?

443
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:44,860
Just stop him from being used
as a breeding vessel.

444
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,270
Why don't we help him elope with Ms. Qing Er?

445
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:50,910
That would still hinder the Yan family's plan to strengthen the Fengshan bloodline.

446
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,960
And Master Yan would still return.

447
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:08,590
You want to drag Mr. Yan out of the mire?

448
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,750
Don't bother.

449
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,180
It will only be a waste of effort.

Trust me, Grandmaster.

453
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:34,070
You really won't turn back
until you hit a wall.

454
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:36,200
We won't know until we try.

455
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,760
I'll go help Ms. Qing'er get ready, then.

456

Have you heard?

457
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,240
Mr. Yan suddenly dismissed all his concubines

458
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,000
and gave each one a huge relocation fee.

459
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,970
He gave each of them a relocation fee?

460
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:48,360
It's true!

461
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,740
No. He formally divorced them.

462
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:56,740
Not only that, he even divided up the family assets among the servants and let them all go.

463
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,500
Really?

464
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,100
I knew it. Things are a complete mess now.

465
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,610
What do you think he's up to?

466
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:06,300
Why is Mr. Yan suddenly acting so recklessly?

467
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,100
I don't get it.

468
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,780
Have you heard?

469
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,060
Mr. Yan is planning to elope with Ms. Qing Er,

470
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:18,220
a courtesan he used to secretly meet
at the pleasure house.

471
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,820
He's thrown away everything
in the Yan family for her.

472
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,590
- Is that true?
- Of course it is.

473
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,800
When Master Yan returns,
there will be a real show to watch.

474
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,530
Definitely.

475
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,949

What has gotten into you?

478
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,380
I heard while I was away that you'd been making a mess at home!

479
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,370
You squandered the family fortune and dismissed all your concubines,

480
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,360
and now you want to elope with a courtesan?

481
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,860
If you keep this up, how will the matter I entrusted to you
ever move forward?

482
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,550
What matter?

483
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,390
Tell me.

484
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:18,030
You actually forgot what I told you?

485
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,940
Useless fool!

486
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:23,720
Those cheap women out there have completely bewitched you.

487
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:27,070
Listen, from now on,
you're not allowed to go out again!

488
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:30,650
I'll get you a few more concubines so you can have more children.

489
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:35,330
Otherwise, our family will be in misery, and you won't live in comfort either!

490
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:37,990
Who are those children for?

491
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:39,740
You...

492
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:44,590
Has the pleasure house rotted your brain?

493
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:46,800
You haven't even greeted me once
since you came in.

494
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,740
You're a disgrace!

495
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,360
You want me to call you "Father"?

496
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,450
I don't think you deserve
that kind of respect yet.

497
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:55,970
You!

498
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,300
Who are you?

499
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,440
You're not my son.

500
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,230
I am your ancestor.

501
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:11,650
Insolent brat, how dare you insult me?

502
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:22,710
Tell me the truth
behind the flame-shaped birthmark on Yan Huan's back.

503
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:27,800
The Yan family and the Sima clan
both belong to the Fengshan lineage.

504
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:32,220
Every few generations, someone in the Yan family
is born with Sima blood,

505
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:35,340
and they will have
that flame-shaped birthmark on their back.

506
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,550
And what do you do with such people?

507
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:42,760
When a child like that is born, they will immediately be sent to that place.

508
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,690
If their bloodline power is strong enough, they will stay there permanently,

509
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:50,070
and our family will be
rewarded with great benefits.

510
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:56,120
If their power is weaker,
like my son Yan Huan's, they will be allowed to return home.

511
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,800
What is that place?

512
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,440
Baifeng Mountain.

513
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,010
Where is it?

514
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,530
I don't know.

515
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:04,670
Emissaries come to pick them up.

516
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,190
We can't go near.

517
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,260
We can only stay outside.

518
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:17,600
If I want to get to Baifeng Mountain quickly, how do I do that?

519
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,820
You'll have to wait.

520
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,720
The emissaries from Baifeng Mountain
contact us, not the other way around.

521
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:27,730
At the end of each month, they come to the residence
to check for pregnancies.

522
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:32,510
If there's a newborn, they will examine

523
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:35,610
whether the child
belongs to the Fengshan bloodline.

524
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:42,760
If they do, they will be taken
to Baifeng Mountain immediately, and I will go along as well.

525
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,970
So, all that is needed is a child?

526
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,340
Not a problem at all.

527
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,990
Have you memorized everything I taught you?

528
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:58,150
I even practice it in my sleep.

529
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,720
Grandmaster.

530
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,550
Nian Jiu, after you keep Master Yan
confined in the residence,

531
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:08,180
I need you to do something else for me.

532
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:11,490
 You can refuse politely by saying... 

533
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,300
This...

534
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,380
This doesn't look right.

535
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,620
What did you say?

536
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,930
How is it wrong to do something for me?

537
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:25,340
 If the other person insists, just keep declining politely by saying... 

538
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,360
I don't have the time.

539
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,660
And if I tell you to make time?

540
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:34,720
 Then you can be more direct
and give a firm refusal. 

541
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,930
No, I can't.

542
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:40,180
Nian Jiu, are you tired of living or something?

543
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,970
What kind of poison have you been feeding him?

544
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,000
My apologies, Grandmaster.

545
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:51,980
I just taught him a few ways of speaking and dealing with people.

546
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,630
You mean you taught him
how to betray his Grandmaster?

547
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,240
I wouldn't dare.

548
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,470
That's quite an accusation.

549
00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:00,660
Grandmaster, this really
has nothing to do with Ru Ling.

550
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:04,760
I was the one pestering her to teach me how to be a better person.

551
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:09,300
The first lesson I learned from her was how to say no to people,

552
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:14,590
because I wanted to stop acting
like some domesticated animal,

553
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:17,700
obedient to everyone about everything.

554
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:27,880
Instead of learning from her, you should have come to me
to learn how to be a person.

555
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,740
Grandmaster, stop giving Nian Jiu a hard time.

556
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,570
I need to go find Mr. Yan now.

557
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:38,180
Why don't you turn me back into a human?

558
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:43,050
Ting Yan.

559
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:47,520
- You're toast.
- So, the otter was Ting Yan?

560
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:52,550
In a few days, I'll be going to Baifeng Mountain
with Master Yan.

561
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:55,960
Return to keep watch on the Shi family and the Eight Palaces for me.

562
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,260
If anything unusual happens,
report to me immediately.

563
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,300
Understood.

564
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:02,580
 If I can make a contribution to this and gain Sima Jiao's trust, 

565
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,990
 then whether I choose to kill or use him later, 

566
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:08,800
 I may be able to break
the Immortal-Demon Barrier faster. 

567
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,420
Grandmaster, let me go with Nian Jiu.

568
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:16,810
Fine.

569
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:21,340
Report to me immediately if anything happens.

570
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,980
Understood.

571
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:27,480
&nbsp;

572
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,990
Mr. Yan.

573
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,800
Please come with me.

574
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,470
Ms. Qing Er and your daughter
are waiting for you.

575
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,620
No, I'm not going.

576
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,860
I can't put them in danger.

577
00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:00,950
They'd be better off staying far away from me.

578
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:05,050
Pull yourself together.

579
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:08,220
Your father has told us about Baifeng Mountain.

580
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:10,030
My Grand...

581
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:14,590
My young master is very powerful.

582
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:18,290
You can count on him
to take care of things there and ensure your safety.

583
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:20,840
We've already paved the way for you.

584
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,180
From now on, you can live however you want.

585
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,670
How can I possibly live a carefree life

586
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:28,510
after going through something like this?

587
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:31,190
The Fengshan bloodline

588
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:35,940
will one day drag me back into tragedy.

589
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,840
He's right.

590
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:08,760


591
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:13,780
