1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

2
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

3
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

5
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

48
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
When you're happy, why do you have to be happy?

50
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You're not sitting in the right place.

51
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Don't think about it.

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Try to find the happiness in your heart.

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Let's go.

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Wait.

55
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You're Yong Shi Qiu from Ye You Palace, right?

56
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Why are you in a hurry to leave?

57
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Why don't you stay with Lin Mei?

58
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
There will be a wonderful show later.

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
If you miss it, it's fine.

60
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Shui Yin, I think you're just talking nonsense.

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
My brother is more straightforward.

62
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
See you another day.

63
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You...

64
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Why are you back so soon?

65
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I thought you would be busy outside for a few days.

66
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What?

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Don't want to see me?

68
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
How could it be?

69
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Do you like this place?

70
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's okay.

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Food is better than school.

72
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Unfortunately, I was busy dealing with them.

73
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I didn't eat well.

74
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
With your current cultivation,

75
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
you don't need to eat this at all.

76
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Except for a mouthful of fish,

77
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
it's of no use.

78
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I eat because I'm greedy.

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I can't understand the fun of

80
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
satisfying the appetite.

81
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
If a person can't even sleep well

82
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
and taste the food,

83
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
there must be a lot of fun in life.

84
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I suggest you taste more food.

85
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's very helpful for maintaining a good mood.

86
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Where are we going?

87
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So you brought me here to drive a small car.

88
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Those people are talking nonsense.

89
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You didn't eat much just now, did you?

90
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You know me too well.

91
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'll eat.

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Eat.

93
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The egg is smooth and melts in your mouth.

94
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The seasoning is more delicious

95
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
and the taste is even better.

96
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's really delicious.

97
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What's wrong with you?

98
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You have someone in front of you.

99
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Why do you insist on eating others?

100
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Eat as you want.

101
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's crispy and chewy.

102
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What's so delicious about this?

103
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
This mortal.

104
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I really want to

105
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
put a plate of snacks on his head.

106
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You heard it?

107
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You heard it?

108
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What did you hear?

109
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Si Ma Jiao, tell me the truth.

110
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Can you hear what I'm thinking?

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Say something.

112
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Can you hear what I'm thinking?

113
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You lied to me again.

114
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Didn't you say you don't know how to read mind?

115
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I really don't know how to read mind.

116
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But recently, when you are not stable,

117
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I can hear what you are thinking.

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Only to you.

119
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You don't need to make such an accurate judgment.

120
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Why are you targeting me?

121
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Ability changes with the environment.

122
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
This is common in the cultivating world.

123
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's not a big deal.

124
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
What changes do you have?

125
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It can't be...

126
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's because of the divine sound.

127
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So you don't need to make an accurate judgment.

128
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You can hear what I'm thinking.

129
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Have you ever heard

130
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
from your father in the Chen Xue mansion?

131
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Liao Ting Yan.

132
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You'd better listen to the healthy lesson

133
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
of the cultivating world in the future.

134
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I can hear what you are thinking.

135
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
One plus one plus two plus four plus three plus nine.

136
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Cang Zong.

137
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Can you hear every thought

138
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
in my mind?

139
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's not that clear.

140
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
But if you are scolding someone,

141
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I know it.

142
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I advise you to calm down.

143
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
How dare you say that about me?

144
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You are so angry.

145
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Four four one six five five twenty five.

146
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Every day,

147
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
you are thinking about something

148
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
that I'm afraid to know

149
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
besides eating and sleeping.

150
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm afraid you don't know me well enough.

151
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The world I'm in is full of information.

152
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
There are all kinds of strange things.

153
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm afraid it's beyond your imagination.

154
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'd better be punished for it later.

155
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Calm down.

156
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
One plus one plus two plus three plus four plus five.

157
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Seven plus seven plus four plus five.

158
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Six plus six plus six plus seven.

159
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
One plus one plus two plus seven.

160
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Calm down.

161
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Stop laughing.

162
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I've never seen anything like this.

163
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's the devil's will.

164
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Let me open my eyes.

165
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Please don't look at me.

166
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Forget it.

167
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
From now on,

168
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'll be a calm person.

169
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It seems that

170
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I often scold the ancestors.

171
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Did she hear it all?

172
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Yes.

173
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Please don't talk to my brain.

174
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Wait.

175
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I was so angry before.

176
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
She didn't react.

177
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
She didn't get angry and slapped me to death.

178
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Could it be true love?

179
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Didn't you hear it?

180
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Didn't you hear it?

181
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm going to take a rest.

182
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Please do as you wish.

183
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Please calm down.

184
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Don't make trouble.

185
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
This is to calm down.

186
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
This is to calm down.

187
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You have your bed.

188
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Go back to sleep.

189
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
My bedside table is here.

190
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm going to take a rest.

191
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I used to sleep well.

192
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Now I sleep faster than me.

193
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Who is the real Xianyu?

194
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Now I sleep well.

195
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Sei기를

196
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,160
and the spiritual house.

197
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,160
The spiritual house of a person

198
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,960
is the most secret place.

199
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,120
You must protect it.

200
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,600
If you get into the spiritual house,

201
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,120
you will die and get hurt.

202
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,640
Master,

203
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,440
what does Dao Lv say?

204
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,000
Be quiet.

205
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,240
Even if it's Dao Lv,

206
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,720
he won't easily

207
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,520
enter the other person's spiritual house.

208
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,000
This is a very dangerous act.

209
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,640
If you are really lucky,

210
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,960
you will meet the same truth

211
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,400
that can share the same life and death.

212
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,960
You may try it.

213
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,840
But now,

214
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,400
you are still young

215
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,080
and you are not wise enough.

216
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,920
But don't be so greedy

217
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,360
and waste your time

218
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,280
in such a big thing.

219
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,240
Why do I feel

220
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,840
I'm like a student

221
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,000
who is learning from the same old problem?

222
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,520
The interaction of the soul

223
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,240
is the most intimate.

224
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,680
One person often dies,

225
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,160
and the other can't live alone.

226
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,280
This is because the soul's connection

227
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,080
is too close.

228
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,480
The feelings are too deep

229
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,120
to separate each other.

230
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,400
So,

231
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,400
you must not

232
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,800
be so careless.

233
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,000
No.

234
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,520
Before falling in love,

235
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,920
it's almost the stage of marriage.

236
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,200
Is it still possible for me and Sima Jiao

237
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,200
to break up?

238
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,040
No.

239
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,840
I don't know these things.

240
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,960
How could Sima Jiao not know?

241
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,880
Has he

242
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,960
completely treated me

243
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,720
as another half?

244
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,600
Ting Yan.

245
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,120
I won't be here tonight.

246
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,600
Be careful.

247
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,560
What do you want?

248
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,040
Why do you ask?

249
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,600
I'm going out.

250
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,200
If you want anything,

251
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,560
I'll bring it back for you.

252
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,960
Bring a gift back from a business trip?

253
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,960
You really look like a couple.

254
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,800
I don't want to choose anything.

255
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,400
I'm not going to choose anything.

256
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,520
Okay.

257
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
Wait for me.

258
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,560
I won't let you wait too long.

259
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,680
Why is he so gentle?

260
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,320
Is he really

261
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,040
treating me as a couple?

262
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,080
This is what I asked you to get a bottle of tea

263
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,640
You should tell him

264
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,360
this is the gift from Master to Joe

265
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,920
when you find him alive.

266
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,560
It's the magazine I really want.

267
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,600
I don't have time to read it off.

268
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,000
I have to hurry.

269
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,520
related to her.

270
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,680
I wonder

271
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,640
whether Ms. Ye

272
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,400
can help to find it?

273
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,680
Mr. Jiang, you don't have to explain it directly.

274
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,880
My disciple

275
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,560
found something interesting

276
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,200
in front of your ruin.

277
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,240
It's a drink Index Trav 확실히.

278
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,680
I'm Hongizhi's student.

279
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,080
You have to help me identify those celebrities.

280
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,220
The group is watching me.

281
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,880
Will it be so fast?

282
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:59,060
We

283
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,020
endeavor.

284
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,960
Our corner of our heart

285
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,560
Let's see if he's even honest with you.

286
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,660
He's the only thing

287
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,940
beside Si Ma Culture

288
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,180
Princess Ye, guess

289
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,860
Once he heard about the dangerous black snake

290
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,720
do you think Si Ma Quer can

291
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,840
help me out?

292
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,460
You're asking me to end it because of the black snake?

293
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:26,380
Do you think the Sima Sect will help us?

294
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,220
You want me to attack the black snake?

295
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,220
I can't bear to.

296
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,740
I...

297
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,740
You're back.

298
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,260
I'm back.

299
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,820
What are you holding?

300
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,100
This...

301
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,620
I saw it in a treasure chest.

302
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,260
I think it's not bad.

303
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,580
I think it's not a simple mirror.

304
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,420
How do you use this?

305
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,180
This mirror...

306
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,180
As long as it has spiritual power,

307
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,660
even if the two mirrors are separated by ten thousand miles,

308
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,980
you can still see each other's situation.

309
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,300
It's a pity that the picture quality is not as clear as my phone.

310
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,300
What?

311
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,980
Nothing.

312
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,980
I like it very much.

313
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,980
I like it very much.

314
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,980
I like it very much.

315
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,980
I like it very much.

316
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,540
Liar.

317
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,540
If you don't like it, then break it.

318
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,060
What are you doing? I like it.

319
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:00,980
Give it back to me.

320
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,820
This is a gift you brought me.

321
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,220
Give it to me.

322
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:11,660
Then how do you plan to thank me?

323
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,300
What can I do for you?

324
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,220
Then explain this to me.

325
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,380
All right.

326
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,820
The only thing I need to do in your eyes,

327
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,940
that is to translate this into Chinese.

328
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,100
We are dangerous.

329
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,820
Can you read this?

330
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,340
But no one listens

331
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,300
Thank you

332
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,940
There are thousands of stars in your eyes

333
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,300
I want to clarify

334
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,820
I am like a firefly

335
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,780
Falling away

336
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,300
This is not gratitude

337
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,180
I don't want to be separated by fate

338
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,780
In the future, you will not only be my boyfriend

339
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:07,140
The world is full of quakes

340
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,140
I forget the cause and effect

341
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,180
boyfriend

342
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:13,060
I am back to the fire

343
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,540
Is to describe the two people's mutual affection

344
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,460
Kiss each other

345
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,580
Don't ask the fire

346
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,260
Light up the night

347
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:28,500
What is not a boyfriend?

348
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,820
I will meet you

349
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,140
Use your words

350
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,180
Love is too crazy

351
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,220
Is

352
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,660
Snow has not stopped

353
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,100
Night has not stopped

354
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,980
Three lives of calm

355
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,140
That is you

356
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,700
No regret in the wind and moon

357
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,020
In the wind and moon

358
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,940
No one is up

359
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,620
No one listens

360
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:25,540
There are thousands of stars in your eyes

361
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,380
I want to clarify

362
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,540
I am like a firefly

363
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,060
Falling away

364
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,700
I don't want to be separated by fate

365
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,620
In the past, we have been separated

366
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:38,260
In the memory, half of the waves

367
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,340
The red city is full of the old lock

368
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:44,020
I forget the cause and effect

369
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,980
I am back to the fire

370
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,020
Even if it's a ghost

371
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,220
I don't want to be separated by fate

372
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,380
Light up the night

373
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,260
I want to describe the two people's mutual affection

374
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,700
Kiss each other

375
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,620
In the dream

376
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,980
Hold hands until the end of the world

377
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,900
I will meet you that day

378
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,740
Love is too crazy

379
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,820
Open the heart

380
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,860
You understand

381
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,620
Love is too crazy

382
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,340
Open the heart

383
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,580
You are not only my boyfriend in the future

384
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:28,820
You understand

385
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,260
Liu Lianen is too crazy

386
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,820
It's also like a little cat

387
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:07,560
Cheng Mix�

388
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,880
My mirror.

389
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,000
This mirror

390
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,600
can be placed

391
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,920
many times

392
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,400
around this Children's Playhouse.

393
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,200
All the pictures

394
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,080
can be put together

395
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,160
Isn't that a live broadcast?

396
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,960
Live broadcast?

397
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,960
What is a live broadcast?

398
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,880
Live broadcast is when you can see

399
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,120
the situation in different places.

400
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,000
For example,

401
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,280
put this mirror on the square of Gengchen's mansion.

402
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,320
We can see the disciples fighting and competing.

403
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,880
Put it in the neighborhood,

404
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,680
we can see the world and the world.

405
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,920
You can even put it in the forest.

406
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,440
Wild animals live in the forest.

407
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,600
Isn't it beautiful?

408
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,000
Sounds good.

409
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,000
In the future, if you hear the sound,

410
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,960
gather your spiritual power and knock.

411
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,120
You can see what I want to see.

412
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,080
You can tell me all about it.

413
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,560
Today, I want to bring you

414
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,480
a little first meeting.

415
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,400
If you don't have the spiritual fire,

416
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,080
the

417
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,480
spirit energy of the Immortal Manor will be completely gone.

418
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,880
From the Immortal Manor,

419
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,080
it will become a desolate, deserted land.

420
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,080
The heaven will also be dismayed.

421
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,480
The Sima Clan

422
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,880
used blood to provide the spiritual fire.

423
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,080
They have guarded the prosperity of the Immortal Manor,

424
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,880
and the spiritual energy of the Immortal Manor.

425
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,880
The Immortal Manor

426
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,480
is the most powerful place in the whole world.

427
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,680
The Immortal Manor

428
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,880
They have guarded the prosperity of the Immortal Manor,

429
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:32,880
and thus obtained the special ability of a higher-ranking person.

430
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,080
There were a few capable people who were born to be gods.

431
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,480
Sima Jiao?

432
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,880
It's me.

433
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,080
Why do you look like that?

434
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,280
I just didn't think that I would be able to use video calls here.

435
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,680
Video...

436
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,480
What is a video call?

437
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,280
It's when we are not in the same place,

438
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,080
but we can see each other.

439
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,480
We can hear each other's words.

440
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,020
You have this

441
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,880
video call in the Demon Realm?

442
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,880
You could say that we do.

443
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,080
But we don't call it a video call.

444
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,080
We call it a phone call.

445
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,680
You are so amazing.

446
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,080
I just said it casually on the live stream.

447
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,680
You really did it.

448
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,880
With this video call,

449
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,080
I can always remind you

450
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,880
that my grandmaster is always here.

451
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,880
You want me to be so nosy, so you just say it.

452
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,880
And you want to make such a video call.

453
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,880
You, Sima Jiao's Jiao,

454
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,880
should use the proud Jiao's Jiao, right?

455
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,280
Last time, you said you wanted to watch the live stream,

456
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,280
so I came to the Three-Long Mountain.

457
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:44,280
Wow, the tower and palace are being rebuilt.

458
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,680
Hey.

459
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,080
Don't you have time limit for your hidden power?

460
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,480
Be careful not to be found.

461
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,880
Don't worry.

462
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,880
I know what I am doing with the Zhaoyan Technique.

463
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,680
That's good.

464
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,480
You hold it higher.

465
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,480
I can't see clearly what's behind.

466
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,080
Sima Jiao.

467
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,680
Hello?

468
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,480
Hello?

469
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,480
Will there be no signal even if I use the beam?

470
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,080
You are here.

471
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,680
You are in the forest fire.

472
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,680
If you find anything, report it immediately.

473
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,680
Hello?

474
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,680
Why is the screen not moving?

475
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,680
I almost got discovered by Fu Zi.

476
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,280
This place is like this.

477
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,080
There is no living thing.

478
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,680
Did you go to find the fire?

479
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,080
Did you find anything?

480
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,880
Not yet.

481
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,480
You don't need to worry about this.

482
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,080
If you like it,

483
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,080
you can look at the scenery.

484
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,280
Fortunately, the blood of the Grand Master and I grew up.

485
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,280
We are familiar with the breath of the Grand Master.

486
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,480
Maybe soon,

487
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,080
we can find the Grand Master and the Fire.

488
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,280
The forest fire?

489
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,280
It's the forest fire that's been burning for a long time.

490
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,280
It's the fire that's been burning for a long time.

491
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,280
It's the fire that's been burning for a long time.

492
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,480
Ru Lin?

493
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,680
Ru Lin is calling me?

494
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,680
Ru Lin!

495
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,880
Ru Lin!

496
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,280
Ru Lin, you called me back so urgently.

497
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,880
Did you encounter any trouble?

498
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,080
Or did someone bully you?

499
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,280
Nian Jiu, I had no choice.

500
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,080
Please forgive me.

501
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,080
Ru Lin, you called me back

502
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,280
just to...

503
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,080
Ru Lin.

504
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,680
Why did you betray the Grand Master?

505
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,480
Sima Jiao killed people like horses.

506
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,880
He deserved to die.

507
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,480
I'm not betraying anyone.

508
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,280
I'm doing justice for the Heaven.

509
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,080
Ru Lin,

510
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,480
tell me.

511
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,080
Did they trick you?

512
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,880
The Grand Master is not that kind of person.

513
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,480
Shut up!

514
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,080
You're not the one who betrayed the Grand Master.

515
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,280
You're not the one who betrayed the Grand Master.

516
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,880
Shut up!

517
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:02,480
Do you know that I can kill you here?

518
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,480
I was a snake.

519
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,080
You gave me the chance to transform into a human.

520
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,880
You gave me my life.

521
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,280
If you want to take it away today,

522
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,280
I'll give it to you.

523
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:29,280
I know that you're not feeling well.

524
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,280
But you have to endure it for a while.

525
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:37,280
The God of Gengchen has released you from the punishment.

526
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,280
I believe that

527
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,280
after Sima Jiao knows,

528
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,280
he will definitely come to save you.

529
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,280
Someone is watching in the dark.

530
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,280
You bite me and then use your nose to suck the blood.

531
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,280
I'll let you out.

532
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,280
Nian Jiu,

533
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,280
we're just students.

534
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:05,280
Why do you care so much about your own life?

535
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,280
You can kill me as you like.

536
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,280
Princess Ye is so cruel.

537
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,280
The Grand Master saw it too.

538
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,280
This evil woman is acting on her own.

539
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,280
I have to get rid of her.

540
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,280
But...

541
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,280
We have to use another method to find out the news.

542
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,280
Don't worry.

543
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,280
I have my own way.

544
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,280
Someone,

545
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,280
drag her out.

546
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,280
Someone bullied her.

547
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,280
Grand Master.

548
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,280
Grand Master.

549
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,280
I know my mistake.

550
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,280
Grand Master.

551
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,280
I found out from the Yanzhi Palace

552
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,280
that someone wanted to investigate your whereabouts.

553
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,280
Fortunately, it was Ru Ling

554
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,280
who helped me escape.

555
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,280
This...

556
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,280
This is the tracking technique.

557
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,280
Someone set me up.

558
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,280
Otherwise, why did you think

559
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,280
Shi Qianli let you come back?

560
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,280
So they wanted to find Grand Master through me.

561
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,280
Grand Master.

562
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,280
Nian Jiu caused such trouble for Grand Master.

563
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,280
I deserve to die.

564
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,280
Stop talking nonsense. Let's go.

565
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,280
Grand Master, there's a magic array.

566
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,280
Stop hiding.

567
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,280
Come out.

568
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,280
Grand Master, sorry for the inconvenience.

569
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,280
Even if I'm not injured,

570
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,280
your methods are too weak.

571
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,280
Grand Master.

572
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,280
Did Grand Master get seriously injured

573
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,280
and not fully recovered?

574
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,280
I don't know.

575
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,280
Did Grand Master get seriously injured

576
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,280
and not fully recovered?

577
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,280
Go back and report to your leader.

578
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,280
Sima Jiao didn't fight with you.

579
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,280
After he escaped from the magic array,

580
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,280
you lost him.

581
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,280
But why did Grand Master let them go?

582
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,280
Those puppets

583
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,280
can detect Sima's blood

584
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,280
on the wet ground

585
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,280
and find the whereabouts of the fire.

586
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,280
They are the fire puppets I chose.

587
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,280
When the time comes,

588
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,280
they can light the fire I buried

589
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,280
and complete the last step of my plan.

590
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,280
Keep this secret from Ye Ruoling.

591
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,280
Yes.

592
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,280
How did you unlock the tracking technique?

593
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,280
I'm incompetent.

594
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,280
I watched Sima Jiao

595
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,280
unlock the magic array and tracking technique

596
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,280
and then disappeared.

597
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,280
He didn't find you?

598
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,280
We hid and didn't fight with him.

599
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,280
Yes.

600
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,280
This way, he can escape.

601
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,280
Okay.

602
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,280
Xun,

603
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,280
I asked you to find out

604
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,280
if there's anything suspicious about the Sun Ghost.

605
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,280
Did you find anything?

606
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,280
There's nothing suspicious.

607
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,280
Go and check

608
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,280
if there's any hidden message in the house.

609
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,280
Yes.

610
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,280
It's boring to watch too much live broadcast.

611
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,280
Why haven't you come back yet?

612
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,280
What's going on?

613
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,280
Did I learn too much magic

614
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,280
and forget it?

615
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,280
I'll go and check.

616
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,280
Okay.

617
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,280
Okay.

618
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,280
Okay.

619
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,280
I'll go and check the books and the information.

620
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,280
I can teach you

621
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,280
what you want to check.

622
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,280
You even know to come back?

623
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,280
What magic trick did you just draw?

624
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,280
This is Yan Wen Zi.

625
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,280
My exclusive password.

626
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,280
Isn't it cute?

627
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,280
It's so late.

628
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,280
Why aren't you sleeping yet?

629
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,280
What are you proud of?

630
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,280
I'm not waiting for you.

631
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,280
I'll go to class when you're not here.

632
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,280
I'll go out to buy snacks, clothes,

633
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,280
and furniture when I have class.

634
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,280
I'm sure...

635
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,280
Don't worry.

636
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,280
This kind of life will end soon.

637
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,280
If you're not feeling well,

638
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,280
don't make yourself so tired.

639
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,280
Don't worry about me.

640
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,280
I'll be at the school tomorrow.

641
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,280
I'll be there.

642
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,280
I'll be at the school tomorrow.

643
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,280
I'll stay longer.

644
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,280
You're not going out?

645
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,280
You're not going out?

646
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,280
You're not going out?

647
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,280
Is it to accompany me?

648
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,280
Do you like to be in the crowd?

649
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,280
In a few days,

650
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,280
it will be the most lively moment

651
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,280
in the Palace of Heavenly Purity

652
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,280
for ten thousand years.

653
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,280
Is it a festival?

654
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,280
Is it a date?

655
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,280
There's still a little road.

656
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,280
It's not a festival.

657
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,280
But I'm going to spend the night

658
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,280
in the Palace of Heavenly Purity.

659
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,280
I'll make it a festival.

660
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,280
I'll make it a festival.

661
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,280
I'll make it a festival.

662
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,280
But I'll make it

663
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,280
a memorial for the late Immortal of Heaven.

664
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,280
I understand.

665
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,280
So it's a business.

666
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,280
All right.

667
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,280
I fell down.

668
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,280
Didn't you say

669
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,280
only when I'm excited

670
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,280
you can come to me?

671
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,280
I can't.

672
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,280
Go.

673
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,280
Go.

674
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,280
Go.

675
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,280
Go.

676
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,280
Go.

677
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,280
Go.

678
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,280
Go.

679
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,280
Go.

680
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,280
Go.

681
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,280
Go.

682
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,280
Go.

683
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,280
Go.

684
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,280
Go.

685
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,480
I finally came back once.

686
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,920
I just know to make people happy.

687
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,840
Then tell me.

688
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,480
What is your favorite thing to do?

689
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,400
Touching fish.

690
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,760
Which club doesn't like touching fish?

691
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,320
You don't know what it means, right?

692
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,120
Who said I don't know?

693
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:32,920
Go.

694
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,920
Go where?

695
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,200
Didn't you say you wanted to touch fish?

696
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:45,800
Why do you have to touch fish with such a big force?

697
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,480
I'm not going.

698
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,520
Why?

699
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,200
The fish here is the best.

700
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,160
It's not easy to catch fish in the river.

701
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,840
It's not easy to catch fish in the river.

702
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:56,960
I'm not going.

703
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,480
Why?

704
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,600
The fish here is the best.

705
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,480
I'm not going to do such a hard thing.

706
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,160
That's all.

707
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,360
Touch it.

708
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,880
The autumn breeze is light and the stars and the moon are scattered.

709
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,760
It's the loneliness that burns through the dust.

710
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,840
The candlelight is weak and the shadow is shattering.

711
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,200
It's shining in the dark night.

712
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:20,800
I used my brush to pick the color of light

713
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:25,000
to warm your cold soul.

714
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,840
The memory is clear and the longing is clear.

715
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,360
But I can't help it.

716
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,800
Wong sat down and the sand Snow fell.

717
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,840
The shed becomes the firefly.

718
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:47,560
It furthers the ripples of everything.

719
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,760
And I'm waiting for you, alone,

720
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,680
European Greek.

721
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:00,680
What's the use of living and dying?

722
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:05,680
I'll only live to read the result for the sake of the people.

723
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,680
Right or wrong, the rumors will be spread.

724
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:16,680
I'll devote my life to the cause and the effect.

725
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:23,680
For you, I'll give my life.

726
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:32,680
For you, for me, for the peace of the world around me

727
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:39,780
The vast sea of clouds is like a rain drop, I'm the one who's being

728
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:48,680
For you, for me, for the sincerity of my life

729
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:58,680
Facing the promise, I'll fly again and again, lighting up with my body

730
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,680
I feel more
