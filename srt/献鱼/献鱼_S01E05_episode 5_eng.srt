22
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,810
Palace Master Yin, why haven't the elders from your palace out yet?

23
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:47,860
Was I right that the Grandmaster's spiritual power hasn't weakened?

24
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,980
Everyone, keep calm.

25
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,600
Just wait for the news.

26
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,910
Do you remember what I taught you?

27
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,190
Where should you stab for a lethal blow?

28
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,310
Do it.

29
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,080
Do it!

30
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,850
Why must you all force me?!

31
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:43,130
Boss, are you trying to scam me?

32
00:02:51,793 --> 00:02:53,403
Don't...

33
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,500
I killed someone...

34
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,290
I killed someone...

35
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,830
The spirit vein has indeed weakened.

36
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,900
A perfect chance!

37
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,240
I won't let you get ahead of me.

38
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,690
Palace Master Xing, aren't you going in?

39
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,380
Sect Master Shi, you are the Grandmaster's guardian.

40
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:06,820
If you don't go in, would I dare to be reckless?

41
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:11,220
You were there back then when the Grandmaster was sealed.

42
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,170
You know better than anyone how powerful he is.

43
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:19,570
Is it true that his spiritual power weakens
 on the night of the new moon?

44
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,680
I have no idea

45
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,900
but I believe the Grandmaster is unwilling to become the prey.

46
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,250
Grandmaster, wake up.

47
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,250
Grandmaster? Grandmaster?

48
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,130
Wake up!

49
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,980
Grandmaster!

50
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,780
You're so noisy.

51
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,810
Are you all right?

52
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,050
Scared?

53
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,610
Of course, I'm scared.

54
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:03,060
I've never even killed a chicken, and you told me to kill you.

55
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,880
Why did you run into my blade?

56
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,370
Don't worry.

57
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:12,660
It was just a necessary step to break the seal.

58
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,160
What do you mean?

59
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,880
The show is about to start.

60
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,910
Grandmaster, how did you end up so gravely injured?

61
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,960
Grandmaster, are you all right?

62
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,020
The person next to the Grandmaster.

63
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,560
You.

64
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,050
Check his pulse.

65
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,590
How do I do that?

66
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,230
I've never studied Traditional Chinese Medicine.

67
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,910
No need to check.

68
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,420
Looking at his condition,

69
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,910
I believe he really can't last anymore.

70
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,890
Indeed.

71
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:13,880
I'm gravely wounded, and my spiritual power is almost gone.

72
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:19,910
I believe you've also found out and rushed over here.

73
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:22,110
Everyone is here.

74
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,280
Good.

75
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,010
My life is here.

76
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,740
Come and get it.

77
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:41,710
Grandmaster, where did you get this confidence from?

78
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:47,290
We just avoided death. Are we going to die together now?

79
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,560
If I don't let you die, you won't die.

80
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:00,780
Sima Jiao. Even now, you're still so arrogant.

81
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:07,250
I sent our disciples here to serve you out of goodwill, yet you killed them without a cause.

82
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,540
Why?

83
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,000
Which palace are you from?

84
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,340
After being confined by you for 500 years,

85
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,400
I can hardly remember.

86
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,350
Among the old people who sealed me back then,

87
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,420
why are there only three of you here?

88
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:31,100
How can I resolve the hatred in my heart if everyone is not here?

89
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:35,580
 He's talking about hatred and grudge even now? 

90
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,150
 He's indeed the Grandmaster. 

91
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,520
 I'm impressed. 

92
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,100
Everyone heard him, didn't you?

93
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,080
Sima Jiao wants to settle old scores with us.

94
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,320
If we join forces tonight, we can settle him.

95
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,420
If we let him live today, we won't escape in the future.

96
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:55,540
Fools. Absolute fools.

97
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:01,190
If I die, there won't be anyone left to sustain the Spirit Fire.

98
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,620
You better think carefully.

99
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,580
Once you are dead,

100
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,790
I'll have the Blood Clot Flower and your corpse.

101
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:14,210
Naturally, we can still protect everyone in Gengchen Immortal Mansion.

102
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:25,810
Are you referring to this flower?

103
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,960
It's a trap!

104
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,650
Sima Jiao lured us here to use our blood to break the seal.

105
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,160
Run!

106
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,470
Where are you going?

107
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,650
It's the Spirit Fire!

108
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,280
We're trapped.

109
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,410
Grandmaster, this must be a misunderstanding.

110
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:14,920
We don't have any evil intentions.

111
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,800
The people from the Heaven Palace didn't mean to disrespect you.

112
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,080
So, it's true.

113
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,590
Your weakness on the night of the new moon was a lie.

114
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,370
You only just realized now?

115
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,530
It's too late for this.

116
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,510

You are a demon!

It's considered a great service!

I will make good use of them.

151
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,780
Correct.

152
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,910
That's good.

153
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:15,400
The seal has been broken.

154
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,800
It's true.

155
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,940
It's false that his spiritual power would weaken.

156
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,460
If the Grandmaster spread that rumor, he must have a plan.

157
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,980
There must be a sea of blood in there now.

158
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,610
Enough. Let's go and check.

159
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,400
Look at them.

160
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,710
Every one of them are feared figures out there.

162
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,670
They are so laughable.

163
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:55,330
What are your thoughts on this?

164
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,940
- Your waist is so slim. 
 - What?

165
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,710
I think it's probably you were sealed for too long 
 and starved into this condition.

166
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,700
You are not wrong.

167
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,350
The pains that I've endured

168
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,890
will be fully repaid one by one.

169
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,330
That's not what I meant.

170
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,180
Palace Master Yin!

171
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,960
Grandmaster, do I have to be buried with you?

172
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,970
You don't want to die?

173
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:14,320
Of course, I don't.

174
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:18,280
I was scared to death just now.

175
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,340
Come on.

176
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,760
Hurry.

177
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,990
The Grandmaster is out from seclusion.

178
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,190
Let's go. Quick!

179
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:42,020
Welcome back from seclusion, Grandmaster!

180
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,440
Welcome back from seclusion, Grandmaster!

181
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:51,400
Liao Tingyan, your neglect in service 
nearly ruined the lifeblood of Immortal Mansion!

182
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,790
Grandmaster, let me cleanse the sect for you today!

183
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,620
I'm doomed!

184
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:02,250
Grandmaster, don't be angry.

185
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,840
How dare you act with such impudence before me?

186
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,030
Spare my life, Grandmaster.

187
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,380
I was only concerned for you.

188
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,100
What are you afraid of?

189
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,820
I told you.

190
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:20,290
If I don't let you die, you won't die.

191
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,890
Is this disciple from the Four Seasons Palace?

192
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,860
How did she win the favors of the Grandmaster?

193
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:33,500
I've never seen her either.

194
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:38,450
He massacred our disciples who were sent to enter the mountain.

195
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:43,340
Why is he keeping this disciple who only has 3 spiritual roots?

196
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,410
How is she useful?

197
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:48,170
When you first sent the disciples,

198
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:51,020
you knew exactly what you wanted to do.

199
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,460
You!

200
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:55,040
Grandmaster.

201
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:59,580
With the Three Saints Mountain in ruins today,

202
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:03,130
why don't you stay at White Deer Cliff for now?

203
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:06,800
Once the disciples have repaired this place, we'll invite you back again.

204
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,470
Still thinking of detaining and sealing me for another 500 years?

205
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,210
Grandmaster, you're mistaken.

206
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,090
- I just...
 - Enough.

207
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,710
Grandmaster.

208
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:34,410
You're not going to kill me because I saw you kill someone, right?

209
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,440
What are you thinking?

210
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,920
If you want to kill me, go ahead.

211
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,210
Stop playing with my mind.

212
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,040
If you're tired of killing,

213
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:01,670
why not go back, bathe and get some sleep?

214
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,520
I'll do as you say.

215
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:19,560
Sect Leader Shi, what's the Grandmaster doing?

216
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,690
Boss...

217
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,610
Grandmaster, I want to live.

218
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,650
Please don't kill me.

219
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,900
I will spare your life then.

220
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,420
This happened too suddenly.

221
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,780
Is that so?

222
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:32,770
I've prepared for this moment for 500 years.

223
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:38,860
The blood of the direct bloodlines of the 
Eight Palaces is needed to break the seal and barriers.

224
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:41,890
I've always known about this method

225
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:46,910
but the challenge was getting their blood to break the seal.

226
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,710
I couldn't leave. I could only make them come to me.

227
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:59,390
I forged the Spirit Fire's avatar and improved my cultivation

228
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:03,380
just to ignite fears in the Eight Palaces.

229
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,470
 Grandmaster, don't be angry. 

230
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,750
 Grandmaster, don't be angry. 

231
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,170
They feared I would break the seal and barrier.

232
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:15,600
Hence, they sent their disciples to enter the mountain.

233
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,600
 I am Wan Ling. I worship you, Grandmaster 

234
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,720
 and wish to serve you. 

235
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:27,830
Once their disciples were killed, 
their fears grew and they took stupid actions.

236
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,820
 He must be still resentful.. 

237
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,100
 We should strike first. 

238
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,790
 Undo the barrier outside the pagoda. 

239
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:40,350
 Rats will slip in through the cracks. 

240
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:47,480
 And that night will be when I'm the weakest. 

241
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,970
Those disciples who slipped out to report

242
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:59,500
will lure the Palace Masters out there 
to take the opportunity to enter the mountain.

243
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:03,970
 Palace Master, the night of the new moon
 is his only weakness in 500 years. 

244
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:06,870
But it's not sufficient to rely on this rumor.

245
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:11,760
 We'll see if the spirit vein weakens on the night itself. 

246
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,410
 The sealing nails in him keep him
from taking his own life. 

247
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:17,030
 That part can't be faked. 

248
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,360
 No more chores for you today. 

249
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,540
 You just need to learn... 

250
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,860
 a killing spell. 

251
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:28,020
 Do you remember how I taught you to kill? 

252
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,210
 Where should you stab for a lethal blow? 

253
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:32,410
 Do it. 

254
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,390
 Why must you all force me?! 

255
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:39,840
I've merged with the Spirit Fire.

256
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,400
Once my heart is damaged,

257
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,270
the spirit vein connected to the Spirit Fire will also be affected.

258
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:51,640
Only when the Eight Palaces witness signs of my weakness,

259
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,780
they wouldn't hesitate to rush into the mountain.

260
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,750
 The spirit vein has indeed weakened. 

261
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,880
 A perfect chance! 

262
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,150
 I won't let you get ahead of me. 

263
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:05,540
Letting you stab me was the final step to making this plan succeed.

264
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:10,740
Why didn't you stab yourself instead?

265
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,150
Why did you make me do it?

266
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,800
Those old geezers of Gengchen Immortal Mansion

267
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:22,300
were afraid I would kill myself 
and make the sect's spiritual power vanish.

268
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,820
Thus, they added restrictions on the nails that chained me,

269
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:28,220
making it impossible for me to harm myself.

270
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:32,080
That was why this stab

271
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:35,380
must be done by you.

272
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,570
Besides,

273
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,230
if I didn't give you this opportunity,

274
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:47,140
how can I judge that you really wouldn't harm me?

275
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:50,070
So, you bet your life on it?

276
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,660
You really are ruthless.

277

♫  The autumn winds sigh  ♫

278

Yes.

285
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:13,170
- Let me hear it. 
 - Killing maniac! Jerk!

286
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,180

312
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:45,910
 Sima Jiao was sealed here for 500 years. 

313
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:49,600
 He's finally out now. 

314
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,900
 Why doesn't he look happy? 

315
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,940
 The Immortal Mansion must be hiding many secrets. 

316
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:04,730
 I will let those people live a bit longer. 

317
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,450
Palace Master!

318
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:13,470
Palace Master!

319
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,240
Palace Master!

320
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:32,720
This lowly servant wants to take over the Palace Master's place!

321
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,440
Who are you?

322
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,470
She can even refine the Palace Master's inner core?

323
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:42,360
Are you from Palace Master's direct bloodline?

324
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,340
- Could she be Palace Master's daughter?
- Palace Master's daughter?

325
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:48,780
Otherwise, how could I've refined his inner core?

326
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,790
Greetings, Palace Master.

327
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,940
Greetings, Palace Master.

328
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,550
Greetings, Palace Master.

329
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,230
From today on,

330
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,900
Yin Palace will be under my control.

331
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:07,410
If anyone is unhappy, come and fight me.

332
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:08,890
We would not dare.

333
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:11,310
Greetings, Palace Master.

334
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:15,320
 Sima Jiao, you've done something good. 

335
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:24,450
 She's really a strange person. 

336
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,340
 It's just sleep. 

337
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:31,150
 Why is she so obsessed with it? 

338
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:10,610
 What happened? 

339
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:15,120
 I was only napping and fell asleep instead? 

340
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:21,660
 I wonder how long he will keep being crazy. 

341
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:26,630
 Those people are just like ants to him. 

342
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:30,070
 I'm probably the same to him. 

343
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,130
 Forget it. 

344
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:35,120
 Just survive day by day. 

345
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,580
♫  Yet turn to dust between fingers in an instant  ♫

00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:35,480
imprisoned me for 500 years.

379
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:14,110
Grandmaster, the place is ready.
   

380
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:16,170
   

381
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,300
Grandmaster.

382
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,820
After the great fire back then,

383
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:03,610
I rebuilt White Deer Cliff.

384
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:06,170
Although it no longer has its former glory,

385
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:09,860
but everything is still as it was.

386
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:15,590
You can stay here in peace with this disciple.

387
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:19,590
Come here.

388
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:28,170
I know you don't like being disturbed.

389
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:32,550
So, I've specially chose some puppets.

390
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:35,790
They don't have consciousness and spiritual souls.

391
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:39,110
You can command them as you wish.

392
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,150
Grandmaster!

393
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:59,840
When you were in seclusion, I couldn't be by your side to serve you.

394
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,680
Now that you have left the mountain,

395
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:08,920
the Shi family should fulfill the duty
that our ancestors entrusted to us.

396
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:15,340
Otherwise, we'll not know how to
conduct ourselves in Gengchen Immortal Mansion.

397
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:18,420
Please allow it, Grandmaster.

398
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,070
Sect Master Shi.

399
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,615
You have always protected the Sima clan

400
00:34:37,615 --> 00:34:40,331
and yet you could resolve the disputes in the Eight Palaces

401
00:34:40,331 --> 00:34:42,485
and escaped unscathed.

402
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:45,320
You have worked hard.

403
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:54,570
I will guard Gengchen Immortal Mansion for you

404
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:57,260
and wait for your return, Grandmaster!

405
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:07,070
 The scenery is nice 

406
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:11,450
 but I'm the only one here
to face this bloodthirsty Grandmaster. 

407
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:15,890
 Who knows how much longer I will survive? 

408
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:18,030
Did you not rest well?

409
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,050
I rested well.

410
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:25,820
Why are you not your usual self today?

411
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,220
What am I usually like?

412
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:31,680
Full of problems, nonsense,

413
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:35,420
and all sorts of gibberish that I can't understand.

414
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:45,960
What are you thinking of?

415
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,840
I'm wondering if those people really had to die.

416
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,960
You think I've wronged them?

417
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,300
I only want to know why.

418
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:59,660
 He's actually not angry? 

419
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:02,240
 His temper is as unpredictable as a cat's. 

420
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,080
Do you like it here?

421
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,030
Yes.

422
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,650
I hate this place

423
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:23,940
but it's still my home after all.

424
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:30,570
I saw these flowers at the Three Saints Mountain.

425
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:47,990
 I almost lost my life. 

426
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:49,790
These flowers

427
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,970
are called Sun-moon Shade.

428
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,700
Their seeds are the bone pearls left in the bodies

429
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,320
of the Sima clan members after their death.

430
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:03,240
One bone pearl can grow into one flower.

431
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,860
So, this is basically a cemetery?

432
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,490
There are so many flowers.

433
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:09,140
So many people have died.

434
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:13,410
The bodies of the Sima clan members vanished after death.

435
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:16,100
The only thing left is a single pearl.

436
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:19,740
I kept many of those pearls

437
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,220
and scattered some in the Three Saints Mountain.

438
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:26,820
I scattered the rest here.

439
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,550
They later bloomed into these flowers.

440
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:33,690
That is both terrifying and romantic.

441
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,260
I will gift you one.

442
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,970
Pick whichever you like.

443
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:47,070
If I pick a flower, will you kill me?

444
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,280
One more thing.

445
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,140
The most unusual thing about the Sun-moon Shade

446
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:08,220
is that, if it's planted from the bone pearl of an evil person,

447
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,680
the flower becomes a deadly poison without any antidote.

448
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:16,630
If it comes from a good person,

449
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:19,360
it becomes a spiritual medicine that can neutralize poisons.

450
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:25,000
But the flowers look the same, so no one can tell them apart.

451
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,070
 Could mine be poisonous? 

452
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:33,170
 So far, everything seems fine. 

453
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:37,460
So, that night on the Three Saints Mountain,

454
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:41,270
Yu Rongrong died because she picked a poisonous flower?

455
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:45,260
Greedy people never have good luck.

456
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:49,300
 Thankfully, I didn't dare to touch the flowers back then. 

457
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:53,950
But this poison without an antidote
 and the spiritual medicine that can neutralize poison,

458
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:57,090
isn't this a contradiction?

459
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:03,910
Since you're still standing here, 
you should have picked the spiritual medicine.

460
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,920
You are lucky.

461
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:14,500
 Didn't I die from the flower's poison?  

462
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,690
 Where am I? 

463
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:19,110
 Isn't that the Grandmaster's little flame? 

464
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,410
- Little flame...
 - Get lost, all of you!

465
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:23,230
Just the sight of you irritates me! Scram!

466
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,340
The voice is different.

467
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:28,740
Looks like it's not the same flame.

468
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,320
Why is your temper always so bad?

469
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,865
Nonsense. You're only here at the wrong time.

470
00:39:37,865 --> 00:39:39,380
   

471
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:50,520
 Why is she feeding the Spirit Fire
with her blood just like the Grandmaster! 

472
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:54,860
When I come tomorrow, will I catch you in a good mood?

473
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,060
I've never taken out my temper on you.

474
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:00,660
It's the other Sima clan members who keep annoying me.

475
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,040
 So, she's a member of the Grandmaster's clan. 

476
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,180
   

477
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:07,440
 This looks like White Deer Cliff in the past. 

478
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,070
Sima E, stop being so stubborn.

479
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,090
I don't want to marry him.

480
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:12,490
I will not marry him!

481
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:15,530
Continuing the pure bloodlines
of the Fengshan clan to feed the Spirit Fire

482
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,700
- is the Sima clan's mission. 
  - It's her again. 

483
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,880
 I must have entered her memory. 

484
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,920
I don't love him.

485
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,490
Nonsense. How can the clan's mission
be measured by love between a man and woman?

486
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:26,890
Sima Shi and you're from the same clan but different branches.

487
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:29,930
You were born to bear the duty of continuing the Fengshan bloodlines.

488
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:32,470
This marriage follows propriety and custom.

489
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:34,550
You're forcing me to marry and bear children?

490
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:36,320
It must be the ideas of the Eight Palace again.

491
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,590
Look at us now.

492
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:40,180
Do we seem like we're in charge of Gengchen Immortal Mansion?

493
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:43,670
We're just puppets to continue the glory of the Eight Palaces.

494
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:46,260
This concerns the prosperity and stability
of the Gengchen Immortal Mansion.

495
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:48,450
E'er, stop being so obstinate.

496
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:49,760
Get out!

497
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,820
Leave now, or I will burn you alive!

498
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,780
 How tragic. 

499
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,990
 She can't decide on her marriage, 

500
00:40:56,990 --> 00:41:00,490
 and is brainwashed to bear the fate of the entire clan. 

501
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:09,530
 But why is the Eight Palaces forcing this marriage for heirs? 

502
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:11,410
How is a life like this

503
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:15,280
any different from being a caged bird?

504
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,470
As long as I exist, the fate of the Sima clan will never change.

505
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:24,180
People's greed has pushed us to the brink of despair.

506
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:28,010
If one day, the Fengshan Spirit Fire ceases to exist,

507
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:32,070
the Sima clan might finally be free.

508
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:39,260
 But the Grandmaster is still feeding the Spirit Fire. 

509
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,160
 A wedding? 

510
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:49,680
 She gave in after all. 

511
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:12,820
 Marriage should be a willing and joyful occasion 

512
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:16,280
 but it feels so suffocating here. 

513
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,620
Sima Shi and Sima E are cultivation partners today.

514
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,530
who will continue the bloodlines of Fengshan

515
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:26,570
and nourish the Spirit Fire!

516
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,490
 The Eight Palaces are revolting. 

517
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:40,380
 I can't believe the Sima clan was bullied like this. 

518
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:46,280
 Where am I now? 

519
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:53,320
- Stop crying.
 - E'er, give our child a name.

520
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:57,390
Let's call him Jiao'er.

521
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:02,270
 This baby is the Grandmaster? 

522
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:25,050


523
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:37,380
"Swimming Across the Ocean" - Hu Xia

524
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:39,360
♫  The autumn winds sigh  ♫

♫  The veins of strands of sand  ♫

538
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,360
♫  I turned into Spirit Fire  ♫

539
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,240
♫  And burned  ♫

540

♫  To overcome the sufferings and break through  ♫

544
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,480
♫  The laws of Heaven  ♫

545
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,380
 ♫ The vortex of reincarnation ♫ 

546
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:41,540
♫  The vortex of reincarnation  ♫

547

550
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,420
♫  Be it right or wrong  ♫

551
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,400
