 ♫ Heavens strike with thunderous wrath ♫

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,420
 ♫ Mountains and rivers shatter before my eyes ♫

00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,780
 ♫ Endless splendor
cultivated through lifetimes ♫ 

4
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,380
 ♫ Turns to dust between my fingers
in an instant ♫ 

5
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,260
 ♫ When the line

17
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:27,020
 ♫ I still choose to be entangled with you ♫ 

18
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,125
 ♫ Through all lifetimes ♫ 

19
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:36,580
 

20
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,820
 

21
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,964
 

22
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,940
Young Master, please sit.

23
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,970
Mr. Ghost, I won't be taking jobs for now.

24
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:07,800
Is it because your friend Yan has gone missing?

25
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,890
You know something about it?

26
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,430
Lately, someone from the Zhihun clan
in Winter City was killed.

27
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:22,430
I heard the killer
was brought before Sima Jiao.

28
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,240
The Celestial Palace man

29
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,640
who just took over Winter City.

30
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,480
The Zhihun clan holds sway in Winter City.

31
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,430
I wondered who'd dare act so recklessly,

32
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,580
so I looked into it.

33
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:42,110
The killer should be Yan, no doubt.

34
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:46,480
You mean she's been caught?

35
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,710
I had people investigate yesterday,

36
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,260
and found her identity isn't simple.

37
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,110
Turns out she was Demon Lord You Chi's assassin

38
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,990
to kill Sima Jiao.

39
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:01,110
She's a Frost Fish from White Bone Abyss.

40
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,450
Given Sima Jiao is merciless,

41
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,370
your friend may be...

42
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,710
in grave danger.

43
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,980
 She really is that Frost Fish? 

44
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,210
I almost forgot.

45
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,640
Back then, Preceptor saved you

46
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,240
right from the White Bone Abyss.

47
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,650
Sounds like you've known
that Frost Fish before.

48
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,020
So...

49
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,980
Yan's truly the one I've been searching for.

50
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:07,590
Young Master, your father once followed
the former Demon Lord You Yan,

51
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,800
fighting for the Demon Realm's cause,

52
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,760
and even raised You Chi.

53
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,580
Yet he ended up discarded

54
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,680
once he'd served his purpose,

55
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,150
thrown into the Nine Nether Purgatory.

56
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:23,960
Since you chose to hide away here,

57
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,520
it means you don't want to be entangled

58
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,640
in any power struggles.

59
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,230
Don't do anything foolish

60
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,640
like opposing Sima Jiao.

61
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,930
Am I just supposed to watch her die?

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,640
Young Master, don't take it so hard.

63
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,200
Besides, now she seems

64
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,760
to have forgotten her Frost Fish memories,

65
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,340
so she didn't recognize you.

66
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,860
What a pity for such a bond.

67
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,200
 Yan, wait for me. 

68
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,100
 I'll get you out! 

69
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:08,230
Preceptor, Feng Qi has set out for Winter City.

70
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,740
Good.

71
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,830
I knew he'd never forget that Frost Fish.

72
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,520
Lucky we never told him

73
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:21,690
that she saved him on my orders.

74
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,590
And by then,
she'd had her emotions stripped away.

75
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,810
Even if her memory returned,

76
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,660
she'd still be a heartless assassin.

77
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:36,760
Now, with his obsession with her,

78
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:41,640
perhaps he can pull Liao Ting Yan
away from Sima Jiao.

79
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,440
Then should we tell the Demon Lord

80
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,790
where Liao Ting Yan is?

81
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,590
Do you think he even cares?

82
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,540
I spoke out of turn.

83
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,120
For now, what matters most is Feng Qi.

84
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,200
When You Yan's soul returns one day,

85
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,880
we'll still need the Chang family's bloodline

86
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,390
to help activate the blood array.

87
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,830
Keep a close eye on Feng Qi.

88
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:10,560
We mainly need him to bring out the Frost Fish,

89
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,540
but don't let him come to any harm.

90
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,300
Yes, sir.

91
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,680
Sima Jiao has no reason to lie to me.

92
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,100
He could've just killed me outright.

93
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,690
My original host really had something with him?

94
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:58,440
No wonder my father
refused to restore my memories.

95
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,680
So, Shi Yan and Sima Jiao are Romeo and Juliet,

96
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,570
star-crossed lovers bound by family feud.

97
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,960
No way...

98
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,880
Sima Jiao says my surname is Liao.

99
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,220
My father says it's Shi.

100
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,860
So, who's telling the truth?

101
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,660
Ms. Yan, may I come in?

102
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,390
Ms. Yan, I finally get to meet you!

103
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:32,460
You are just like my mother said,
so warm and familiar.

104
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,640
I specially prepared these new clothes for you.

105
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,460
Hurry and take off that dirty outfit.

106
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,130
And you are...

107
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:51,120
I'm Zhou Yue Qing, daughter of Zhou Qing Er.

108
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,470
You and Grandmaster saved me once 18 years ago.

109
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,810
Now, you're the closest people I have.

110
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,780
Why say we're the closest to you?

111
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,930
You really don't remember?

112
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,830
Grandmaster and I share the Fengshan bloodline.

113
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,880
He's like family to me.

114
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,590
And since you and he are cultivation partners,

115
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,460
you're my family, too.

116
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,270
I'm really his cultivation partner?

117
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:29,440
My mother said you
and Grandmaster are a perfect match.

118
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,560
Then do you know what my name was back then?

119
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,290
Liao Ting Yan.

120
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,610
Don't put it there.

121
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:42,530
 Why do they all say the same thing? 

122
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:46,610
 Could Sima Jiao have gathered people
to trick me? 

123
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,940
 What's he after? 

124
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,290
What's this about?

125
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,960
Grandmistress, Grandmaster asked us
to make the room more festive.

126
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,470
Does this look good?

127
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,890
I'm not the Grandmistress.

128
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,400
This is clearly a bridal chamber.

129
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,740
Sima Jiao wants to marry me?

130
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,920
That must be it.

131
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,830
I'd better get everything
ready for your wedding.

132
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,460
Hurry!

133
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,960
What's good about it?

134
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,740
If my father finds out, he'll be furious!

135
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:55,180
What kind of nonsense is all this?

136
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,230
What's this?

137
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,220
You used to love touching fish.

138
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,530
Touching fish?

139
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,400
 Does he mean slacking off at work? 

140
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:24,860
 Maybe the original host
just liked touching fish... 

141
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,740
 Still feels weird. 

142
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,250
That's a pretty odd hobby.

143
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,460
 You said you loved to touch fish. 

144
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,920
 Go on, touch it. 

145
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,060
 I'm touching a fish. 

146
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,320
 You're so lazy. 

147
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,230
 You only like touching fish 

148
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,860
 when someone brings it to you. 

149
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,820
Guess you don't like it anymore.

150
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,700
I prepared food for you.

151
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,470
Why won't you eat?

152
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,980
I'm not hungry.

153
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,770
You once said you eat
not because you're hungry,

154
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,220
but because you enjoy it.

155
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,110
I don't enjoy it that much.

156
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,740
I eat just to fill my stomach.

157
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,280
 You've reached Soulshift stage. 

158
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,590
 Do you still need to sleep? 

159
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,510
 No, but I enjoy it. 

160
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:38,160
 Like food, there's no need to eat,
but I just enjoy it. 

161
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,110
 If a person can't even
enjoy sleeping or good food, 

162
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,740
 life loses much of its joy. 

163
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,700
Well then, why don't you try a little?

164
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,740
Afraid I tampered with the food?

165
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,820
No.

166
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:25,630
I've never seen someone look so pained eating.

167
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:29,560
It tastes bad. Forget it.

168
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,710
I'll find you something better.

169
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,100
No need.

170
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,700
Greetings, My Lord!

171
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,329
 

172
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,920
- Have you seen this person?
- No, I haven't.

173
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,630
But no matter, I'll help you find him!

174
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,080
Guys, search for this one!

175
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,080
Yes!

176
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,460
This way, please.

177
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:06,080
Qian Lv, has Liao Ting Yan been
convinced by Sima Jiao

178
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,350
and turned on us?

179
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:11,370
Otherwise, how could he find you so quickly?

180
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:16,400
Though Liao Ting Yan
is a lazy good-for-nothing,

181
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,510
she's still loyal and true.

182
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:23,220
In the first two years
after she lost her memory,

183
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,400
I kept her from meeting anyone.

184
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,940
That way, I built her dependence on me.

185
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,280
Back then, she was like a rabbit

186
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,200
thrown into a wolf's den,

187
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,980
and I was the only one she could trust.

188
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,630
Even now that she's lost her memory,

189
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:43,440
no matter how well Sima Jiao treats her,

190
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,040
I believe she'll never betray me.

191
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,740
So, what do we do now?

192
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,920
All of Celestial Crane City is hunting us.

193
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,100
This place won't stay safe for long.

194
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,990
Let's leave Celestial Crane City first,

195
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,440
then plan our next move.

196
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,870
Boss, this is the place!

197
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,860
This is where we spotted them!

198
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,440
Search it!

199
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,040
Don't miss a spot!

200
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,370
 Yes! 

201
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,960
My Lord, there's no one inside,

202
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,410
but it seems like they just left.

203
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,510
No matter, the city's sealed.

204
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,410
He won't get out.

205
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,350
If he could escape from the Purgatory,

206
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:50,320
how could a little city gate ever hold him?

207
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,990
Then what do we do?

208
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:54,750
The Demon Realm is vast, fractured,

209
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,870
and full of hiding spots.

210
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,290
No matter.

211
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,100
We've got time

212
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,860
to wear him down.

213
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:24,700
Does Ting Yan really eat so plainly every day?

214
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,560
If Grandmaster knew,

215
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,610
he'd feel awful.

216
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,280
Grandmaster looks fierce and ruthless,

217
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,080
but he's actually gentle and deep?

218
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,220
Depends on who it is.

219
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,610
I've followed Grandmaster for 400 years,

220
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,740
and he's never treated anyone else this gently.

221
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:43,060
 I was born to be alone. 

222
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,980
 Over the years, 

223
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,890
 I never cared for anyone else. 

224
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,080
 But with you, 

225
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,530
 I gave all my heart. 

226
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,650
 In the end, I was too arrogant. 

227
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,860
 I let you suffer all this. 

228
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,420
Ting Yan!

229
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,990
Yan, kill them!

230
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,990
Pathetic.

231
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,880
Give up your core,

232
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,960
and maybe I'll leave you and your father whole.

233
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,360
Yan!

234
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,290
Do it!

235
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,310
Please...

236
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,790
spare us...

237
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,920
Yan!

238
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,470
What are you waiting for?

239
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:59,510
If you don't kill them, they'll kill you!

240
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,230
No...

241
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,510
Shut up!

242
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:05,380
Father... Father...

243
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,180
Ting Yan!

244
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,550
Strike!

245
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,770
No...

246
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,750
Do it!

247
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,010
Father...

248
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,640
Kill him.

249
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,330
Now! Do it!

250
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,940
I taught her to kill like this.

251
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:48,680
Yan, you finally struck back!

252
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,420
That's how you're meant to be!

253
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,940
 Shi Qian Lv. 

254
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,250
 I'll tear you limb from limb! 

255
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,460
No!

256
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,700
Don't kill me!

257
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,840
It's you...

258
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,070
I thought...

259
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,680
 No, wait. 

260
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,550
 I should feel more nervous seeing him. 

261
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:20,140
 Why do I feel relieved instead? 

262
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,420
 Does this body still remember him? 

263
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:40,300
 ♫ In the world of madness,
love burdened with greed ♫ 

264
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:47,440
 ♫ Branded with scars too raw to hide ♫ 

265
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:53,700
He looks like a sad, harmless cat.

266
00:21:53,700 --> 00:22:00,380
 ♫ This budding love is then severed ♫ 

267
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:06,790
 ♫ The tale of fate keeps winding on ♫ 

268
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,700
Shi Qian Lv gave you that scar?

269
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,940
Wasn't it you?

270
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,710
Back at Taiwei Mountain,

271
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,640
you set fire trying to burn me alive.

272
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,850
That scar you left

273
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,440
was seared by the Spirit Fire,

274
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,700
and it won't fade.

275
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,470
 ♫ Through every trial we've endured ♫ 

276
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,750
If you don't deny it,

277
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,510
then it must be true.

278
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,660
I never meant to harm you.

279
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:43,050
But you were hurt because of me.

280
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:49,220
 ♫ Destiny leads where my heart belongs ♫ 

281
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:56,100
 ♫ Awakened memories will never fade again ♫ 

282
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:01,820
 ♫ Guiding the hope of love ♫ 

283
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:23,460
 ♫ The tale of fate keeps winding on ♫ 

284
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:29,460
 ♫ I'm unafraid though memories are gone ♫ 

285
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,770
Ting Yan.

286
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:37,920
All these years past,

287
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,090
I've often been lost in dreams.

288
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,090
Yet in my dreams,

289
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,620
you never once appeared.

290
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:50,600
 ♫ No matter who has sought the cure ♫ 

291
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,700
Later, I realized...

292
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,700
The most frightening thing

293
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:03,050
isn't death itself,

294
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,620
but the parting it brings.

295
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:17,420
 ♫ Guiding the hope of love ♫ 

296
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:21,820
 ♫ Why must we suffer all this? ♫ 

297
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:26,060
 ♫ Piercing us through every season ♫ 

298
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:34,660
Sorry, I don't think we're that close.

299
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,020
 ♫ Reborn beyond souls ♫ 

300
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:44,860
 ♫ May this chain of enduring fate ♫ 

301
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,600
What's this box?

302
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,290
Looks unusual.

303
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,660
It's for me?

304
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:09,010
An anklet.

305
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,050
I made it myself.

306
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,660
Do you like it?

307
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,380
Is this anklet

308
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,980
meant to trap me?

309
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,400
No, it's to protect you.

310
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,680
Then what about the barrier outside?

311
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,920
It's the same.

312
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,360
Now that you have this artifact,

313
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,940
the barrier outside isn't needed.

314
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,920
This defensive anklet

315
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,270
can block all harm done to you.

316
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:02,090
All harm?

317
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,420
Even from you?

318
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,810
But the Spirit Fire can burn anything.

319
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,880
What defensive artifact in this world

320
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,490
can withstand the Spirit Fire?

321
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,660
This one can.

322
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,980
The incident from 18 years ago

323
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,360
will never happen again.

324
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,180
So, that makes me unstoppable now?

325
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,530
Well then, thanks.

326
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:47,420
I know deep down

327
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:50,750
you still want to trust me.

328
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:56,050
 Is he too in love
with this body's original owner? 

329
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:08,380
Your wound hasn't healed yet?

330
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:12,460
It's no matter.

331
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:31,391
 

332
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,880
My Lord, we're already here.

333
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,980
Why not take the guys in for a little fun?

334
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,440
Keep guard here with the others.

335
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,220
I'll be right back.

336
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,570
How's the drinking?

337
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:20,120
All right. I'll be back soon.

338
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,200
- My Lord!
- My Lord!

339
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,840
- My Lord!
- My Lord!

340
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,710
- My Lord!
- What are you two doing?

341
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:30,880
My Lord, forgive us
for not welcoming you properly.

342
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,310
Where's the girl who danced here last time?

343
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:37,440
You mean Hong Luo?

344
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,070
Wasn't she killed by your two men?

345
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:43,640
You mean the girl killed
by those Zhihun guys was her?

346
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,880
Yes.

347
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,360
That day, Hong Luo was on her way to visit you,

348
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,710
but she was ambushed.

349
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:52,400
Why did she want to see me?

350
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,920
Because she admired you, of course.

351
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,310
She said you and she

352
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:58,850
were fated lovers from a past life.

353
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,460
A past life?

354
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:04,460
Do you have a portrait of her?

355
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,840
Ru Ling?

356
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,160
My Lord, what did you call her?

357
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,810
You knew her?

358
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,120
That girl was truly pitiful.

359
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,510
When I found her,
her spirit sense was badly damaged.

360
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,400
She remembered nothing.

361
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,470
All she had left was a tube whistle.

362
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,990
I spent countless demon stones

363
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:35,750
trying to heal her wounds.

364
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:38,030
- And yet...
- Tube whistle...

365
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:40,010
Where exactly did you find her?

366
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,770
By Yin-Yang Lake.

367
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,620
I haven't slept this well in ages.

368
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:11,660
Wait, how am I sleeping so soundly
in enemy territory?

369
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,360
But days without being forced

370
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:18,530
to cleanse my marrow
or seek revenge are really good.

371
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,250
Did you have nightmares?

372
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:31,200
No. I actually slept till morning.

373
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,180
What used to be so ordinary, now...

374
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,900
feels rare.

375
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,090
Ms. Yan, taste this.

376
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:59,250
 Why does it look like braised pig's trotters
from Celestial Crane City? 

377
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,660
 The ones Hong Luo, Feng Qi, and I often ate... 

378
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,980
 It really is the same! 

379
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,160
You like it?

380
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,310
Mostly because I had it often.

381
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:24,710
It just feels familiar.

382
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:29,310
Bi An, do you remember the cook who made this?

383
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:32,200
- Yes.
- Is he trustworthy?

384
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,400
All who enter the manor
have been vetted by Nian Jiu.

385
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,570
I'll bring him here right away.

386
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:44,750
 I always feel like
I've stolen someone's boyfriend. 

387
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:47,360
 But I can't tell him I'm from the modern world. 

388
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,510
 What kind of trashy body-double drama is this? 

389
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:54,570
 If Sima Jiao finds out the truth,
will he wipe me out? 

390
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,920
You really didn't need to find me a cook.

391
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:01,120
Once Hong Luo is revived,
I'll just leave with her.

392
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,070
I won't trouble you.

393
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,700
Where are you going?

394
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,810
Back to Shi Qian Lv?

395
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,750
Even if you hate him, he's still my father.

396
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:17,880
I plan to take him and Hong Luo somewhere safe,

397
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,550
and live the rest of our lives quietly.

398
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,770
We won't bother you anymore.

399
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:33,070
Where's the place you speak of?

400
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:35,920
I'm afraid I can't tell you.

401
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,530
After all, you and my father are sworn enemies.

402
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,700
So, in your vision of the future,

403
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,660
I have no place at all.

404
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:03,470
Things between us are awkward now.

405
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:07,310
I've probably forgotten about the past.

406
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:09,710
Even though I live well here,

407
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:12,230
it still feels uncomfortable.

408
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:15,160
So, maybe we should part ways,

409
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,770
and each live our own lives.

410
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,220
You've forgotten the past,

411
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,620
but that doesn't matter.

412
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:25,470
Wherever you want to go,

413
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,840
I can take you.

414
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:30,220
Wherever I want to go, I can go myself.

415
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:34,310
I'm grateful for your kindness,

416
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,960
but the person I am now

417
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,070
isn't the Liao Ting Yan you remember.

418
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:40,380
Do you understand?

419
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,620
I won't mistake you.

420
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,570
No, you don't understand.

421
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:57,180
Grandmaster, Ms. Yan, I've brought the cook.

422
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,230
Greetings, Grandmaster.

423
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:01,160
Grandmistress wants you here.

424
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,850
You should thank her, too.

425
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,810
Thanks for your kindness, Miss.

426
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,020
Miss?

427
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,630
The braised pig's trotters you like

428
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,630
are made with a secret method.

429
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,150
If you're interested,

430
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:21,970
I can explain in detail how to prepare them.

431
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:29,110
I'm very interested.

432
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,320
I'd love to discuss it with you.

433
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,400
Then I won't waste your time.

434
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,740
Please.

435
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:47,590
How did you know I was here?

436
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,550
Finding you wasn't hard.

437
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,440
Well? Pretty loyal of me, right?

438
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,960
I came all this way to find you.

439
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,990
That's way too risky.

440
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:57,760
What if I hadn't eaten your food?

441
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,880
Then you'd have come for nothing.

442
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,720
We've known each other for years.

443
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,760
Don't I already know what food you like?

444
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,800
We've got that kind of understanding.

445
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,450
So confident, huh?

446
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,440
Go on, eat up.

447
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,280
Then come with me.

448
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,990
I'll leave only after
Sima Jiao revives Hong Luo.

449
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:16,180
He can revive Hong Luo?

450
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,850
Why would he be so kind?

451
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,850
I think...
I used to be his cultivation partner.

452
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:33,720
Either you were, or you weren't.

453
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,150
What do you mean "think"?

454
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:38,880
Well, you probably
don't know how I got this scar.

455
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,670
I once suffered a grave injury.

456
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,990
After that, the scar stayed on my face,

457
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,990
and all my memories were gone.

458
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:47,550
According to Sima Jiao,

459
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:50,700
before I lost my memory,
I was his cultivation partner.

460
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:55,400
Then he healed the scar?

461
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,220
Did it heal completely?

462
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:26,060
Yan.

463
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:30,790
Did you stay just for Hong Luo,

464
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:33,500
or are you drawn
to how well Sima Jiao treats you?

465
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:38,990
He treats me well because of who I used to be.

466
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,930
I'm not that full of myself.

467
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:45,180
I'm glad you get that.

468
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,840
In a while, I'll find a way

469
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,700
to take you and Hong Luo away together.

470
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,720
Who sent you?

471
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,240
Do you know her?

472
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,850
No...

473
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,360
Feng Qi, don't...

474
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,550
I don't just know her.

475
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:13,150
We ate and slept side by side,
sharing life and death.

476
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,550
We're inseparable.

477
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,360
What nonsense is this? Stop making trouble.

478
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,060
You're asking for death.

479
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,840
Wait! Allow me to introduce.

480
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,720
- Yan...
- This is Feng Qi, my friend.

481
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,990
Didn't you tell me
Hong Luo was your only friend?

482
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,030
A different kind of friend.

483
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,590
Hong Luo is my girlfriend.

484
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:31,190
- And Feng Qi is...
- Your boyfriend?

485
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,630
You know what "boyfriend" means?

486
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,070
You told me before.

487
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,840
That's impossible.

488
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,360
Is he your boyfriend or not?

489
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,970
No, he's not my boyfriend.

490
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:48,550
Get out now, and I'll spare your life.

491
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,890
Feng Qi.

492
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,700
Even if I die, I won't leave her.

493
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,400
Hopeless fool.

494
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,940
You're courting death.

495
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,320
I...

496
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,850
Wait!

497
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,400
Stop this! Why are you acting tough here?

498
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,850
Leave now. I'll be fine!

499
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:25,920
I didn't come here planning to leave alone.

500
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,190
Why don't you kill me in front of her,

501
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:32,140
and see if that wins you her heart?

502
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:36,250
Don't you dare touch him.

503
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:40,700
Or I'll truly see you as my enemy.

504
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:11,360
Yan, don't fall for his tricks.

505
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,840
People from the Celestial Palace
are born liars.

506
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,470
Better than putting on a tough act like you.

507
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:18,930
What was that just now?

508
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,580
Don't tell me you've fallen for...

509
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:31,030
Now tell me, you still think about that girl

510
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:33,140
who once saved your life, don't you?

511
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,740
That's right.

512
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,360
I've never forgotten her.

513
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,240
Good.

514
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,020
I thought you might feel something for me...

515
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:47,590
Why pretend we had something in front of him?

516
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,700
Weren't you afraid he'd kill you?

517
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,500
I...

518
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,550
I just...

519
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:59,020
I just couldn't stand his smug face.

520
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,990
Lucky for you Sima Jiao
isn't the ruthless killer from the rumors.

521
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:07,290
Otherwise, you'd be long dead.

522
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,060
So, you already think he's not so bad?

523
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:17,930
Did Sima Jiao put some spell on you?

524
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,290
No.

525
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:26,190
But honestly,
he's nothing like the stories say.

526
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,630
He's not scary at all.

527
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,440
In fact, he's kind of considerate.

528
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,800
Almost like a little cat, proud on the surface,

529
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,810
but quietly watching over my needs.

530
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,890
Maybe deep down he's softer than he lets on.

531
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:52,800
 I plan to take him and Hong Luo somewhere safe, 

532
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,470
 and live the rest of our lives quietly. 

533
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:56,070
 We won't bother you anymore. 

534
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:58,990
 Things between us are awkward now. 

535
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:02,630
 I've probably forgotten about the past. 

536
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:05,440
 So, maybe we should part ways, 

537
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,100
 and each live our own lives. 

538
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:13,510
 I'm grateful for your kindness, 

539
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:15,150
 but the person I am now 

540
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:17,810
 isn't the Liao Ting Yan you remember. 

541
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,560
 ♫ Autumn winds sigh ♫ 

542

 ♫ The vortex of reincarnation ♫ 

563
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,840
 ♫ What of life and death? ♫ 

564
