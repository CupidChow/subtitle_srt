00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,600
 ♫ Heavens strike with thunderous wrath ♫ 

2
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,320
 ♫ Mountains and rivers shatter before my eyes ♫ 

3
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,680
 ♫ Endless splendor
cultivated through lifetimes ♫ 

4
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,440
 ♫ Turns to dust between my fingers
in an instant ♫ 

5
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,120
 ♫ When the line
between good and evil is clear ♫ 

6
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,240
 ♫ Countless souls drift
into the boundless wilds ♫ 

7
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,400
 ♫ Carrying the spirit fire forward ♫ 

8
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,480
 ♫ I defy fate ♫ 

9
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,880
 ♫ Just to remain by your side ♫ 

10
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,880
 ♫ Falling into love's abyss ♫ 

11
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,760
 ♫ Like heavy rain pouring down ♫ 

12
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,360
 ♫ Drunk on romance ♫ 

13
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,320
 ♫ In a blink, love and hate
vanish into illusion ♫ 

14
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,280
 ♫ Falling into endless love ♫ 

15
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,520
 ♫ Stirring waves upending a lifetime ♫ 

16
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,760
 ♫ Even if this life leads to ruin ♫ 

17
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,920
 ♫ I still choose to be entangled with you ♫ 

18
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,025
 ♫ Through all lifetimes ♫ 

19
00:01:30,025 --> 00:01:36,480
 

20
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,458
 

21
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:49,640
 

22
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,290
Just a few months apart

23
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,120
and you don't recognize me?

24
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,200
The wedding date we agreed on
has already passed.

25
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,440
Come on.

26
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,830
I'll take you somewhere.

27
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,640
If you don't sleep, the sun will be up.

28
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,050
Sima Jiao!

29
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,670
Disturbing someone's sleep is the worst crime.

30
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,510
You...

31
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,747
 

32
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,220
Weren't you in seclusion?

33
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,670
When was this Flower Sea built?

34
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:09,610
Planning to hold the wedding here?

35
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,270
Look familiar?

36
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,610
Kind of.

37
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,040
It's modeled after your Soul Manor.

38
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,510
The first time I entered your Soul Manor,

39
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,390
I was captivated

40
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,440
by the serene atmosphere.

41
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,170
If you like it, just enter as you please.

42
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,570
Why build another one?

43
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,110
If you ever feel restless,

44
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,600
you can come here and sleep.

45
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,640
Everything will feel the same.

46
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,550
As long as you're with me,

47
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,230
all unease will vanish.

48
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,480
This tree smells amazing.

49
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,040
That's a rare wood.

50
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,390
In sunlight, it gives off a light fragrance.

51
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:17,800
The scent calms the heart

52
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,120
and suppresses the turmoil inside you.

53
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:27,710
When I'm restless,
can't you handle it yourself?

54
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,710
I don't have a job?

55
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,950
Since when were you a wage slave?

56
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,830
That's only because someone keeps slacking off.

57
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,130
This place makes for good sleep.

58
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,240
Lying down already makes me drowsy.

59
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,680
Then sleep if you're tired.

60
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,030
I'll stay with you.

61
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,360
Jiao, what are you doing?

62
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,390
Why are you passing all your power to me?

63
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,950
It's about to begin.

64
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,660
What's about to begin?

65
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,360
Tell me now!

66
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:28,510
Since the day I was born,
I've endured this pain.

67
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:33,640
This little wound is nothing.

68
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,510
Do you understand?

69
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,800
What are you trying to do?

70
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:47,120
I fused the Fengshan Spirit Fire

71
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:50,390
into my blood and soul.

72
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:56,020
Soon, it'll all belong to you.

73
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,360
That's what your seclusion was for?

74
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,680
You're insane!

75
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,830
Don't worry.

76
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,240
It doesn't hurt.

77
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,640
I'm leaving this fire to you.

78
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:17,100
From now on,
nothing in this world can hurt you.

79
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,490
Every one of our enemies

80
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,560
has been killed.

81
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,270
What I'm leaving you

82
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,130
are the people and things you love.

83
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,910
Why?

84
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,610
We're doing fine.

85
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,830
Why do this?

86
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,070
Ting Yan...

87
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,800
I was never meant to last.

88
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,210
No...

89
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,220
You know it best.

90
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,860
No...

91
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,710
In my Soul Manor,

92
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,120
there's a fire that never dies.

93
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,900
It gave me power above all,

94
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,170
but took other things from me.

95
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,640
No...

96
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,360
Since I merged with the new Spirit Fire,

97
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:19,130
my body's been collapsing.

98
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,830
After several heavy blows,

99
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,360
I confirmed it.

100
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,290
- No...
- The Sima clan is doomed to fall.

101
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,320
I won't allow it!

102
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,240
And I...

103
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,270
will also die.

104
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,390
When I die,

105
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,530
the Spirit Fire in me will go out.

106
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:00,960
No...

107
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,790
But I can't accept it.

108
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,030
I can't rest easy.

109
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,650
No way...

110
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,370
Did you ever ask me?

111
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,980
I don't want it.

112
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,390
Ting Yan.

113
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,190
The demon core in your body

114
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,490
has already fused with your inner core.

115
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:28,820
It can't be removed.

116
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,190
No...

117
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,720
Only this Spirit Fire can suppress it now.

118
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,150
From this moment on,

119
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,880
you'll be the second me.

120
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,080
You'll hold the power above all living things.

121
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,600
With my soul as your guide,

122
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,100
you won't have to endure

123
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,480
the pain the Spirit Fire brings.

124
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,840
Heaven may want me dead,

125
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,840
but I won't hand my life to it.

126
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,480
In this world, I only love you.

127
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,240
So, of course, it's yours.

128
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,120
 ♫ Love and hate vanish into illusion ♫ 

129

Just wait.

133
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,130
If you die,

134
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:46,060
I'll be a rich widow inheriting millions.

135
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,960
The moment you die, I'll find hundreds of men.

136
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,460
There will never be anyone else.

137
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,060
You'll never forget me.

138
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,080
Dream on.

139
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,960
Why should everything go your way?

140
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,510
I won't let you have your wish!

141
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,760
Ting Yan.

142
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,670
Live well.

143
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,150
No matter where you are,

across mountains and rivers,

145
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,030
I'll come back to you.

146
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:47,480
Even if only as a gentle breeze,

147
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,890
whispering at your ear,

148
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:54,600
I'll stay with you for millennia.

149
00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:01,670
If you're gone,
why should I linger in this world?

150

Sima Jiao?

00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,050
the Celestial Palace
and the Demon Realm were split

173
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,930
by Yin-Yang Lake.

174
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,530
Later, the current Immortal-Demon Ruler

175
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:01,500
united the two realms.

176
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,170
Then she merged with the Spirit Fire,

177
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,330
gaining boundless power,

178
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:12,220
protecting prosperity for both realms.

179
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:16,380
But I heard she killed her fiancé,
Lord of Mercy,

180
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,140
to seize his Spirit Fire.

181
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,330
That Lord of Mercy was feared by all.

182
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:23,330
To kill him shows the ruler
was even more ruthless.

183
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,380
Truly terrifying.

184
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,220
It's good they fear her.

185
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,300
After hearing she killed Lord of Mercy,

186
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:35,260
those with scheming hearts
never dared turn disloyal.

187
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,690
- Exactly.
- Besides, the ruler cares for the people.

188
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:38,780
She has the world in her heart.

189
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,930
Everyone can see that.

190
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:45,340
Sir, which side do you think is the true ruler?

191
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,770
Yes, sir.

192
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:51,100
That's for the people of both realms to judge.

193
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:56,420
I only know she's done much

194
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,300
to merge the realms

195
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,730
and bring peace,

196
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,000
with great results.

197
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,250
Senior Li, Senior Gu.

198
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,730
You're finally here!

199
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,530
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

200
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:13,730
We've developed some new spells this time.

201
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,060
We want to discuss them with you.

202
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,300
Now that the Immortal-Demon Barrier
between realms is gone,

203
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,340
travel is easy, and yet you arrive only now!

204
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,940
We just wanted to prepare properly

205
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,130
before coming to study.

206
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,060
All right. Let's talk at my residence.

207
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,220
Fine, let's go!

208
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,980
- Please!
- After you!

209
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,770
- Let's go home.
- Okay, Mother.

210
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,080
Careful.

211
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,340
Just follow the prescription.

212
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,390
Thank you!

213
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,150
My head hurts.

214
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,730
Here, Madam.

215
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:49,940
Nothing serious.

216
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,060
Here's your prescription.

217
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,300
And a subsidy for your medicine.

218
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,730
I came to get medicine and ended up with gems?

219
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:59,340
Before this, such things were unbelievable.

220
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,180
Thank you so much!

221
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,790
Please, have a seat.

222
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,650
Master Yuan, did you secretly stay up

223
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:16,180
working on papers again last night?

224
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,940
I had nothing to do yesterday,

225
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,730
so I drafted the next five days' papers
ahead of time.

226
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:25,530
The rule I set for both realms

227
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,610
is an eight-hour workday.

228
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,420
If you don't lead by example,

229
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,650
how can the people follow?

230
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,820
Abide by the law.

231
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,340
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

232
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,100
I admit my mistake.

233
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,650
You all heard it.

234
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:41,300
Anyone breaking the eight-hour rule

235
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,890
will lose half a year's salary.

236
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:46,240
 We obey! 

237
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,490
If there's nothing else, court is dismissed.

238
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:53,360
 Long live Your Majesty! 

239
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,310
Sleeping so soundly.

240
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,550
Did you dream of something sweet?

241
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,830
Where have you been all these years?

242
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,510
Sima Jiao?

243
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,090
Sima Jiao.

244
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,640
Sima Jiao!

245
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:19,320
 ♫ I'm unafraid though memories are gone ♫ 

246
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:26,240
 ♫ Through karma's journey,
all lifetimes share one gaze ♫ 

247
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:32,360
 ♫ I believe in each life
we'll fall in love again ♫ 

248
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,250
 ♫ Through every trial we've endured ♫ 

249
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:42,310
You said this tree's scent calms the heart

250
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:47,010
and suppresses the turmoil inside, liar!

251
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:50,050
It just makes me dream of you every day,

252
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:52,440
unable to forget you!

253
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,250
 ♫ Awakened memories will never fade again ♫ 

254
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,920
 Back then, 

255
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,760
 you suffered the burning
of the Spirit Fire like this, 

256
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,830
 yet always pretended you were fine. 

257
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:16,330
Such heavy worries

258
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,090
will harm Her Majesty's health.

259
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,590
Back then,

260
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,700
Grandmaster burned his own flesh and soul

261
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:27,050
to purify Yan's inner core,

262
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:30,660
injecting the refined Spirit Fire
into her body,

263
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,920
securing her place
as today's Immortal-Demon Ruler.

264
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,860
How could she ever forget that?

265
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,720
The Grandmaster gave his love.

266
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,160
The Ruler returned it with devotion.

267
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:49,770
He refined the Spirit Fire with his very being

268
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,640
to cleanse her demon core,

269
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,180
losing his cultivation and his soul.

270
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,730
To give him a chance to survive,

271
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,870
she forcibly preserved a wisp of his soul,

272
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,220
using secret arts to transfer it
and grant his rebirth.

273
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,290
But without his complete soul as a guide,

274
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,240
the demon core inside her

275
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,460
could never be fully removed.

276
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:18,830
And so, she suffers
the Spirit Fire's torment day and night.

277
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:27,140
The Grandmaster's soul
was burned to a single wisp,

278
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,770
and with no suitable vessel nearby,

279
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,980
she could not fuse it.

280
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,180
She had to release that wisp of soul

281
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:37,030
back into the world, to find its own path.

282
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:44,590
Even now, Yan doesn't know
where her Grandmaster is.

283
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,030
Preceptor.

284
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,240
She must drink this medicine.

285
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,790
We can't ease her grief,

286
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:04,550
but at least it can ease her pain.

287
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:10,590
Now the world is peaceful,

288
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,480
the quiet I longed for.

289
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,270
Sima Jiao.

290
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:21,000
If only you were here...

291
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:26,640
You're here, Preceptor.

292
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,160
I'll make sure you drink it.

293
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:37,290
Your master said this medicine
is for the burning pain inside you.

294
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,730
It only works if you take it regularly.

295
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,000
Come on.

296
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,380
It barely works.

297
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,810
Every month there are days of pain.

298
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,460
It's not just for pain relief.

299
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,940
The demon core inside you is suppressed,

300
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,420
but it still troubles you.

301
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,200
This medicine can calm your mind.

302
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,070
Drink it, come on.

303
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:06,570
All right.

304
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,090
Bitterness always ends with sweetness.

305
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,700
Since I'm being so obedient,

306
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,220
let's go feast on Yan City's food street!

307
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,330
Eating again?

308
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:16,050
- Try it!
- Freshly grilled skewers!

309
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:19,310
Come, take a look!

310
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:29,440
 All the things you left me, I like them all. 

311
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,200
 But without you, 

312
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:35,680
 what meaning do they have? 

313
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,440
Look.

314
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:43,250
Your exchange program really worked

315
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,900
in bringing realms together.

316
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,010
Look at this street now.

317
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:52,720
Immortals and demons
live like family, don't they?

318
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,700
How about this place to eat?

319
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,590
Sure. Let's go.

320
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,530
Sir, we haven't even ordered.

321
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,660
Did you serve the wrong table?

322
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,940
With Your Majesty's presence,

323
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,620
these are free dishes from our shop.

324
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,810
Please enjoy.

325
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:23,620
Your shop's so small,
and you send out so many dishes.

326
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,250
How will you make money today?

327
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,290
- I'll pay.
- No!

328
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:33,220
Your light taxes
already help small shops like ours.

329
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,290
These few dishes are just respect.

330
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,440
Please enjoy.

331
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:44,140
I already treat people kindly,

332
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,700
yet when they look at me,
it's like they've seen a demon.

333
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,330
You have to understand.

334
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:54,070
After all, your killing of Sima Jiao
is known everywhere,

335
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:58,240
and now you've merged with the Spirit Fire.

336
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,440
All he planned...

337
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:06,240
was to keep everyone too scared to cross me.

338
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:17,660
If he can see
you're ruling both realms so well,

339
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,860
he'll be at peace.

340
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,760
Enough talk. Drink up.

341
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:28,310
Preceptor Hong Luo,
you're so diligent and selfless.

342
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,440
Exactly.

343
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,960
Haven't seen you with Nian Jiu lately.

344
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,440
Him?

345
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:43,980
How can I ever get a big shot like him?

346
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,380
These days, he's all secretive,

347
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,090
not even a shadow to be seen.

348
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:50,940
When I look for him, he's "too busy."

349
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,810
Or we're together one moment,

350
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:55,250
the next he's suddenly gone.

351
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,940
It makes no sense.

352
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,490
Where's he gone?

353
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:00,010
Haven't you asked him?

354
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,620
Of course I did.

355
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,700
He won't say.

356
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,010
Every time I see him, I get mad.

357
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:12,760
If he isn't guilty,
why be so sneaky all the time?

358
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:15,460
What's going on with him?

359
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,420
Didn't he just propose to you days ago?

360
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,260
Well, forget it.

361
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,260
No!

362
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:24,140
I've watched you two
fall in love for two lifetimes.

363
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,420
You can't just end it like this.

364
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,490
I'll vent your anger for you.

365
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,000
I'll go talk to him.

366
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,160
Drink up!

367
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,140
Ting Yan.

368
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,330
What are you doing?

369
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:42,530
You scared me.

370
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:44,590
So, you do know fear.

371
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:48,250
Tell me, you keep sneaking around lately,

372
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,140
where have you been?

373
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:53,460
Chi An He said
you've been neglecting your duties,

374
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,380
even leaving Hong Luo behind.

375
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,980
I never abandoned Hong Luo.

376
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,140
But she wants to drop you now.

377
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,900
She thinks you've been unfaithful

378
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,510
and sent me to cut ties with you.

379
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,460
Hong Luo misunderstood me.

380
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,730
I'll explain to her right away.

381
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:10,730
How about you explain it to me first?

382
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:11,940
Explain what?

383
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,700
I... I can't say.

384
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,810
Forcing me to fight, huh?

385
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:20,960
If I find another girl's scent on you,
you're done!

386
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,270
Why do you carry Sima Jiao's aura?

387
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:35,810
What?

388
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,700
You've known where Sima Jiao was all along?

389
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,870
And you kept it from us this whole time?

390
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:43,860
Yes...

391
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,660
19 years ago,

392
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:49,140
before Grandmaster went into seclusion
to refine the Spirit Fire,

393
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:54,900
he told me where I could find him,

394
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,920
if Ting Yan was willing to keep his soul.

395
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,380
Grandmaster seemed to have something to finish,

396
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,870
but never told me.

397
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,330
But we failed to give him

398
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:08,620
the Soul-Restoring Pill in time.

399
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:11,180
So, he should have lost all memory by now.

400
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:14,380
How could he follow the old plan?

401
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,870
Maybe...

402
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:18,760
Grandmaster has his own way.

403
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:25,620
We can restore his memories
through cultivation.

404
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,490
Then we'll know everything!

405
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:28,900
No.

406
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:32,200
He hasn't even come of age yet.

407
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,660
Ting Yan, his soul right now

408
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,090
can't bear the weight of old memories.

409
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:42,620
I once suggested to him that he tell me

410
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:46,010
what he plans to do, every single thing.

411
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:48,980
And when I find you again, I'll tell you then.

412
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:52,140
But Grandmaster said even without old memories,

413
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:55,050
he wouldn't believe someone else's words.

414
00:27:55,050 --> 00:28:00,270
If I went and told him,
it would only make him wary.

415
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,350
At least he knows what he's like.

416
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:07,220
Ting Yan, don't be mad.

417
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,330
Grandmaster truly didn't want you to worry.

418
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,420
How can I not worry?

419
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,270
Either way I'll worry.
You might as well tell me where he is!

420
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,960
Tell me, where is he now?

421
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,440
Right now,

422
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,000
he's in the mortal realm.

423
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,460
19 years ago,

424
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:33,620
Grandmaster was born as a prince of Hu Kingdom.

425
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,250
But he ascended the throne as a child,

426
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,810
unable to govern.

427
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:40,160
Many sought his life to seize the throne.

428
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,620
 

429
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:59,250
Mercy, Your Majesty!

430
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,680
- Mercy!
- Silence!

431
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:06,050
How dare you act so clumsy before the Emperor!

432
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:07,660
Guards!

433
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,730
Drag him out!

434
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:11,620
Mercy, Your Majesty!

435
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,730
That's why I must go to the mortal realm often

436
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,330
to protect Grandmaster's safety.

437
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:17,350
That guy really is something.

438
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,180
Wherever he goes, he's like royalty.

439
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,180
He actually became an emperor
in the mortal world.

440
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,420
So, the task he wants to finish

441
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:27,460
requires him to be emperor?

442
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,900
I don't know.

443
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,770
Just recently,

444
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:35,250
Grandmaster visited Liyang County in secret,

445
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:37,140
but was ambushed by bandits.

446
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,000
So, I went to protect him.

447
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:46,860
Hong Luo, that's why I missed our meeting.

448
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,250
You could've just told me sooner.

449
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,310
Grandmaster didn't allow it.

450
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,240
Fine.

451
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,140
Then I want to see how he rules a kingdom.

452
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:01,180
Ting Yan, you can't just
go to the mortal realm.

453
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:04,460
Hu Kingdom has almost no spiritual energy.

454
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:07,090
There aren't even basic sects there.

455
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:09,180
They're all mortals.

456
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:12,900
For them, cultivators like us are just legends.

457
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,620
Many have never even heard of us.

458
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,070
Get to the point.

459
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,700
In the mortal realm,

460
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,570
the stronger your power,
the greater the limits.

461
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:27,900
Ting Yan, you're the most powerful
cultivator in existence.

462
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,380
Which means the restrictions on you
will be greatest.

463
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:34,980
There, you can only use the most basic spells.

464
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:38,180
Otherwise, you'll suffer terribly,
even face backlash.

465
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,700
Doesn't matter.

466
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,220
I'm used to being a mortal.

467
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,760
There's more!

468
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,700
You Yan might've used the body from Bi An

469
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,090
to return to this world.

470
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,140
What?

471
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:52,810
Fengshan blood can nourish his soul.

472
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:56,660
Besides, Bi An's been gone so long
without a trace.

473
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,160
I fear...

474
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:02,380
Ting Yan, Grandmaster
was truly worried about you.

475
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,330
That's why he never told you all this.

476
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:07,900
And right now, no one knows

477
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,310
if You Yan hides in the both realms
or among mortals.

478
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:14,940
So, you must be extremely careful this trip.

479
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,890
All right, I know.

480
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:17,180
- I'll go with you!
- Also!

481
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,570
You mustn't let them know who you are...

482
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:21,880
- Got it!
- We don't want the mortal realm in chaos!

483
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,263
 

484
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,700
I just heard the news.

485
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:45,000
Sima Jiao here is said to be cruel and lustful.

486
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,420
With plenty of concubines,

487
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,730
he must be a foolish ruler.

488
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:54,030
You should be prepared.

489
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,380
Get out!

490
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,960
Now!

491
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,090
 

492
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:02,310
Your Majesty, they've arrived.

493
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:12,310
I, Wei Xian Yu, Governor of Liyang County,
greet Your Majesty.

494
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:23,420
I thought this place was too complex.

495
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,330
Your Majesty's life is priceless.

496
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:28,180
With only one eunuch by your side,

497
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,530
it's unfit for you to stay in this brothel.

498
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:35,550
To be safe, I came to escort Your Majesty back.

499
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,810
Even when Sima Jiao was Grandmaster,

500
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:40,660
outsiders called him brutal.

501
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:43,200
But that was just the surface.

502
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:46,530
As for lust...

503
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,140
his throne isn't steady now.

504
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:51,240
He probably needs marriages
to win over officials.

505
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:55,700
Whatever he is in this life, I'll accept it.

506
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,960
I just want him alive.

507
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:09,940
Your Majesty, what have I done wrong
to anger you?

508
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,000
Your presence here alone

509
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:15,420
angers me.

510
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,570
Guards.

511
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:20,160
Drag him out and execute him in the street.

512
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:23,770
Your Majesty!

513
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:25,920
Spare me!

514
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,940
- Look, an execution!
- Move aside!

515
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:32,180
- Don't crowd around!
- Move aside! No watching!

516
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,380
Who is that?

517
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,200
Move aside!

518
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,240
Everyone, move aside!

519
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,180
Isn't that the county governor?

520
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,420
Why is he being dragged by his own guards?

521
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,720
Yeah.

522
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,860
Life and death in the mortal world follow fate.

523
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,030
Best not meddle.

524
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:56,810
Who else can execute a governor in public?

525
00:33:56,810 --> 00:34:00,810
You mean the Grandmaster-Emperor in disguise?

526
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:02,380
Could be.

527
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:06,440
If we save him,
maybe he'll lead us to Sima Jiao.

528
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:11,780
- Your Majesty.
- Everything is arranged?

529
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,900
Reporting to Your Majesty,

530
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,780
we sent men to rescue Wei Xian Yu
during the execution.

531
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,380
By now they should've succeeded,

532
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,830
and are on their way back to report.

533
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:26,260
Frankly, killing Wei Xian Yu outright
won't be wrong.

534
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:29,570
That bandit raid the other day
was his doing, too.

535
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:31,720
Too bad he escaped.

536
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,870
He's already grown disloyal.

537
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:41,870
Sooner or later, he was bound to strike again.

538
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:47,390
If I give him another chance now,

539
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,940
we can use him

540
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,040
to catch the Marquis of Nanyan.

541
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,170
Years ago, Wei Xian Yu made his fortune

542
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:57,940
by hoarding grain
during Yan Prefecture's drought.

543
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,210
Later he embezzled soldiers' pay,

544
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:02,050
seized land, and killed innocents.

545
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:04,600
He's got plenty of dirty dealings.

546
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:10,300
How could a mere county governor
pull all this off?

547
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,570
Of course it was under the orders

548
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,690
of that old fox, the Marquis of Nanyan.

549
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:14,780
Exactly.

550
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,820
The Marquis has had wild ambitions.

551
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,940
Since Your Majesty's childhood,

552
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,170
he's held court power
and commanded the imperial guards,

553
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:22,340
weakening your influence,

554
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:25,680
leaving you to inherit the throne
in a tight spot.

555
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,210
Since you were young,

556
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:36,690
assassins have come after you countless times,

557
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:38,460
even leaving you with a head illness.

558
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,490
Truly bitter.

559
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:42,160
Bitter or not,

560
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:48,570
someone has to guard. Hu Kingdom's land.

561
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:50,490
Your coming of age is near.

562
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:53,010
Then comes the rite that affirms your rule.

563
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:56,990
By then, the ambitious
will be forced to hold back.

564
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:04,470
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

565
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,490
What are you doing?

566
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:11,420
See, you've been hit by backlash.

567
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,050
Reflex.

568
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:15,260
Don't use your power so rashly. I'll handle it.

569
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:22,910
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

570
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,980
Why do they want to kill you?

571
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,830
Who gave the order?

572
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:35,090
It...

573
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:37,870
it was His Majesty.

574
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:45,980
Your Majesty.

575
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,900
I waited at the dock,

576
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,530
ready to rescue Wei Xian Yu
during the execution.

577
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:53,530
But suddenly my vision blurred.

578
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:55,340
When it cleared,

579
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,830
- Wei Xian Yu had already been taken.
 - Kill him! 

580
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:59,590
Kill him!

581
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:02,740
Hurry and find out who did it!

582
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,080
Yes, sir!

583
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,380
Bring me that woman in orange.

584
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,680
Yes, Your Majesty.

585
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:40,130
Ladies, please stay.

586
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:44,690
Such beauty and elegance, no wonder.

587
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:47,490
My lord saw you from afar at the tavern,

588
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:48,570
and couldn't get you out of his mind.

589
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,210
So, he sent us to invite you.

590
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:53,340
Please come meet him.

591
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,530
I see.

592
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:58,830
We've run into a lecher,
sending his men to grab women.

593
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,120
Don't be rude!

594
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,610
My lord means no offense,

595
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:07,600
only wishes to speak with you
at Songbird Pavilion.

596
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:10,210
Is your lord Sima Jiao?

597
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:13,420
How dare you call him by name!

598
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,040
How do you know?

599
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,650
Songbird Pavilion...

600
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:21,680
Sima Jiao, you scoundrel!

601
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:25,170
- Don't lose your temper.
- How can I not?

602
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,650
He's not only got concubines, brothels,

603
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:29,170
now he sends men
to snatch girls off the street!

604
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:33,870
Didn't you just say you'd accept him
no matter what, as long as he's alive?

605
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:38,080
Not anymore. My standards just shot up.

606
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:41,260
All right.

607
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:45,210
Now that we've found him,
I'll head back to Yan City.

608
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:48,390
The rest is up to you.

609
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:52,820
Just say I went into seclusion.

610
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:55,390
Affairs of state will be handled
by my Preceptor.

611
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,740
Please, lead the way.

612
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,080
This way.

613
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:22,200
Miss...

614
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,980
 

615
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,520
Miss Yi Huo.

616
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:28,740
On the Marquis's order,
I'm here to deliver a message.

617
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:31,090
Since the bandit plot failed,

618
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:33,780
you must act again quickly.

619
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:38,010
If Sima Jiao returns to court,
we'll lose the chance.

620
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:40,520
Since Sima Jiao shows no mercy,

621
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,820
I won't hold back either.

622
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:47,690
At this point, we can only strike at the root.

623
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:49,820
Please tell the Marquis this.

624
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:55,870
This time, I will succeed,
and help him kill Sima Jiao!

625
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:26,610
Why would the aura of the demon core

626
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:28,950
and the Spirit Fire appear here?

627
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:34,390
Liao Ting Yan has merged with the Spirit Fire?

628
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:37,910
Why did she come to the mortal world?

629
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:51,270
No matter.

630
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:56,760
The timing is perfect.

631
00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:00,300
I've rested for over a decade.

632
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:04,830
It's about time I met some folks.

633
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,610
Have you found her?

634
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:34,870
Yes.

00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,620
 ♫ I'll stir the murky seas ♫ 

669
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,820
 ♫ And strive against the heavens ♫ 

670
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:17,500
 ♫ To protect the vastness ♫ 

671
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,580
 ♫ For you ♫ 

672
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,460
 ♫ For me ♫ 

673
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:25,300
 ♫ For the light of dawn ♫ 

674
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,380
 ♫ I'll face promises ♫ 

675
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:29,660
 ♫ Like a moth to a flame ♫ 

676
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:36,820
 ♫ And use my body to shine ♫ 

677
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:41,460
 ♫ On even more ♫
