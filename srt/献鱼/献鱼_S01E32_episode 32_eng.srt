00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,520
 ♫ Heavens strike with thunderous wrath ♫ 

2
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,320
 ♫ Mountains and rivers shatter before my eyes ♫ 

3
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,680
 ♫ Endless splendor
cultivated through lifetimes ♫ 

4
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,440
 ♫ Turns to dust between my fingers
in an instant ♫ 

5
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,120
 ♫ When the line
between good and evil is clear ♫ 

6
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,240
 ♫ Countless souls drift
into the boundless wilds ♫ 

7
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,680
 ♫ Carrying the spirit fire forward ♫ 

8
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,480
 ♫ I defy fate ♫ 

9
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,841
 ♫ Just to remain by your side ♫ 

10
00:00:56,841 --> 00:01:00,880
 ♫ Falling into love's abyss ♫ 

11
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,760
 ♫ Like heavy rain pouring down ♫

 ♫ Drunk on romance ♫ 

13

 ♫ In a blink, love and hate

14
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,320
 ♫ Falling into endless love ♫ 

15
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,520
 ♫ Stirring waves upending a lifetime ♫ 

16
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,760
 ♫ Even if this life leads to ruin ♫ 

17
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,920
 ♫ I still choose to be entangled with you ♫ 

18
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,025
 ♫ Through all lifetimes ♫ 

19
00:01:30,025 --> 00:01:36,480
 

20
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,570
 

21
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,070
The demonic energy in me has driven me to kill?

22
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,700
Madam, may I come in
to help you with your hair?

23
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,640
- Wait outside for now.
- Yes.

24
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:54,060
Liang Chen, have you heard anything
about what happened in the palace?

25
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,840
I just heard that all the birds
in the harem died overnight.

26
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,070
Could it have been my doing?

27
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,640
Is my demon core acting up again?

28
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,080
I have to see Master.

29
00:02:17,293 --> 00:02:18,820
Father?

30
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,040
I heard you went to see Madam Yan?

31
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,610
I sent you letter after letter warning you

32
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,260
to stay away from her.

33
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,380
Why didn't you listen?

34
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,860
But you told me to win His Majesty's favor
to keep him under control.

35
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,050
I just wanted to put Madam Yan in her place

36
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,490
so she'd stop competing with me.

37
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,820
That was then. Things are different now.

38
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,940
This is not the time to fight for favor.

39
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,050
Just do as I say.

40
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,050
I only want to keep you safe.

41
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:47,660
This is an artifact
I obtained from an immortal.

42
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,830
Keep it with you. It will protect you.

43
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,010
Your Majesty, the demonic energy
in your demon core

44
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,860
is indeed beginning to stir.

45
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:20,320
Those birds died because of it.

46
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,980
Fortunately, I have devised a prescription

47
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,420
that can temporarily suppress the energy.

48
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,730
What if it grows so strong
we can no longer control it?

49
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,820
What then?

50
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,010
You would need to give up all your cultivation.

51
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:42,260
Only then would the demon core
in your body become inert,

52
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,160
unable to control you.

53
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:52,980
But your cultivation would vanish as well.

54
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,540
If I lose all my cultivation,
I won't be able to protect Sima Jiao.

55
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,490
But if I fall under the demon core's control

56
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,390
and become You Yan's pawn,

57
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,160
I will kill Sima Jiao with my own hands.

58
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,880
That is You Yan's scheme.

59
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,920
Is there truly no other way out of this trap?

60
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,730
The Spirit Fire and the demon core
restrain each other,

61
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:23,420
but the demon core can break free one day

62
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,690
and completely suppress the Spirit Fire.

63
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,020
If you do not want to lose your cultivation,

64
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,780
you must instead strengthen
the Spirit Fire within you.

65
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,020
How?

66
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,680
By burning it with your own blood as fuel.

67
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:39,070
But that would be like
using poison as medicine.

68
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,580
And if you wish to suppress
the demon core entirely,

69
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,950
I fear...

70
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,220
I fear it would take
your very bones and blood as a sacrifice.

71
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,360
Your life itself would burn away.

72
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,050
Jiao told me

73
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,460
that you were a goddess descending to earth,

74
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,680
fated with him from a past life.

75
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,370
He also said that the canal

76
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,290
couldn't have been built without your help.

77
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,258
I couldn't help but wonder.

78
00:05:13,258 --> 00:05:17,710
Could Jiao and I
also share a bond from a former life?

79
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,360
In your past lives, Your Majesty
and His Majesty were also mother and son.

80
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,250
I believe his rebirth in this world

81
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,250
was to follow you here

82
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,560
so that he could be with you again.

83
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,360
Really?

84
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,100
What a sweet girl you are.

85
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,050
Seeing how fond Jiao is of you,

86
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:53,580
I am sure he will make you Empress
once he completes his coming-of-age ceremony.

87
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,780
After that,

88
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,860
you will both take part in the worship ritual,

89
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,580
and I can finally put my worries to rest.

90
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:05,690
Your Majesty, do you mean that the empress
may also enter the Hushan Hall for the rite?

91
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,170
Of course.

92
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,930
The Emperor and Empress must go together
into Hushan Hall to perform the ritual.

93
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:14,340
It has been the tradition
of the Hu Kingdom for generations.

94
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,580
After the ritual,

95
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:20,780
Jiao will formally inherit
the jade seal kept in the hall

96
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,070
and truly become the emperor of Hu.

97
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,810
 

98
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:35,810
Your Majesty, must the worship ritual wait
until after the wedding?

99
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:39,100
The ritual can only happen
after the coming-of-age ceremony

100
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,220
and then the wedding.

101
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,760
This has always been the tradition
of the Hu Kingdom.

102
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,690
Why do you suddenly ask?

103
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,810
Your Majesty, I helped you accomplish

104
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,250
something as great as the canal.

105
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,760
By merit alone, shouldn't I
already be named Empress?

106
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,440
Could you name me Empress
right after your coming-of-age ceremony?

107
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,170
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- The title will be yours sooner or later.

108
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,120
Why are you in such a hurry?

109
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,034
I...

110
00:07:14,005 --> 00:07:15,500
What's wrong?

111
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,810
You're burning up.

112
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,610
No need to worry, Your Majesty.

113
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,640
I only need a little rest.

114
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:35,390
I once dreamed of fire raging in my body.

115
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,320
It looked exactly like you now.

116
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,390
Back then, I couldn't
truly understand your pain.

117
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,970
It was only after I carried

118
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,050
the Spirit Fire refined from your soul

119
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,860
that I finally understood

120
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,760
how deep your suffering had been.

121
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:06,590
How did I ease the pain at that time?

122
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,510
I would do this.

123
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:33,000
And once, I even brought snowfall
for Your Majesty.

124
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,730
Speaking of which,
it's been so long since I last saw snow.

125
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,640
When it snows again,

126
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,940
I will be there with you.

127
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,240
Great.

128
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,300
When it is only the two of us,

129
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:54,370
may I stop calling you "Your Majesty"?

130
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:57,860
I think that "you," "me," and "us"

131
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,080
sound much more beautiful.

132
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,803
Certainly.

133
00:09:09,304 --> 00:09:10,790
I mean, yes.

134
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,550
Does it still hurt?

135
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,180
You kissed me first.

136
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,060
And I'm done kissing you.

137
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,760
You don't decide when it ends.

138
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,250
Don't be difficult.

139
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,670
Time for bed.

140
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,030
Are you upset?

141
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,360
No.

142
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:21,300
Isn't it nice to just chat
under the quilt like this?

143
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,530
If you touch me again,

144
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,980
I can't promise

145
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,720
it will only be talking under the quilt.

146
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,580
That's fine.

147
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,510
I will make sure it is.

148
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,600
You're cheating.

149
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,600
Why won't you let me get close to you?

150
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,310
I have my reasons.

151
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:06,650
Then why can't you tell me the reasons?

152
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,720
It isn't time yet.

153
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,800
Then when will it be time?

154
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:16,484
Tell me, do you know what a Soul Manor is?

155
00:11:19,535 --> 00:11:20,800
I don't.

156
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,500
Then just sleep under the quilt.

157
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,710
After the worship ritual, you'll know.

158
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:56,030
 "Meet me at the lakeside
at Chou hour. Nian Jiu." 

159
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,300
Nian Jiu would never send me a note.

160
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,460
This is obviously fake.

161
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,820
At least learn from real scammers
before trying this.

162
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,300
 Next time, send word to me first. 

163
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,310
 Don't just barge into my chamber. 

164
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,730
I told Nian Jiu to send me a message first

165
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,840
if he found You Yan's trace.

166
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,360
Did he really find it?

167
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,890
 That demon, Liao Ting Yan, 

168
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:05,580
 has bewitched His Majesty, 

169
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,910
 and now she's even used sorcery
to deceive the world! 

170
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,960
 What... What's that? 

171
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:30,610
 "Come to Ziquan Palace lakeside alone
at Chou hour, or your entire clan will die." 

172
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,980
 This is outrageous. 

173
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,240
 Go. 

174
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,410
 Fetch my cloak and Demon-Revealing Mirror. 

175
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,370
 Madam, you mustn't go. 

176
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,370
 With the mirror, what do I have to fear? 

177
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,530
 I will make His Majesty and the Empress Dowager 

178
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,860
 see that demon's true colors! 

179
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,820
 Listen, if I haven't returned within two hours, 

180
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,250
 take people to look for me. 

181
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,840
 - Do you understand?
- Yes. 

182
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,910
How did I fall asleep?

183
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,310
Where is Nian Jiu?

184
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,360
There she is!

185
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,790
Blood...

186
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,270
So much blood!

187
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,100
Your Majesty.

188
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,180
Your Majesty, we found
Noble Consort Si Xian's body

189
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,220
in Madam Yan's palace.

190
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,340
Her blood was completely drained,

191
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:03,180
and her flesh looked as though
it had been eaten clean by a beast.

192
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,980
Can you determine the time of death?

193
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,530
Roughly during the Chou hour.

194
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:10,180
That matches the testimony
from her maid and guards.

195
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:16,490
Your Majesty, all signs point to Madam Yan...

196
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:21,300
Chen Tang, you compared the handwriting
on these two notes yourself.

197
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,860
Can't you see this is a deliberate frame-up?

198
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:27,760
Your Majesty, if this is a frame-up,

199
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:33,300
why was there blood on Madam Yan's clothing?

200
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,550
That is what you should be investigating.

201
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,820
Your Majesty, to uncover the truth quickly,

202
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:48,220
I beg Your Majesty to order Madam Yan
held in detention pending trial.

203
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:54,670
Chen Tang, have you grown tired
of being Minister of Justice?

204
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,250
As long as I serve in this position,

205
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,360
I will carry out my duty to the fullest.

206
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:11,220
Your Majesty, in order to clear my name,

207
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,490
please grant Minister Chen's request

208
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,670
and allow me to be held in custody.

209
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,760
No.

210
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,940
I will not let you be thrown in prison.

211
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,840
My mind is made up.

212
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,840
Minister Chen, please lead the way.

213
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:40,150
This cell is cleaner than I expected.

214
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,530
Is this really the time

215
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,890
to care about that?

216
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,770
Hong Luo. Nian Jiu.

217
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:49,180
Ting Yan, why did you ask to be imprisoned

218
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,180
over Noble Consort Si Xian's death?

219
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:55,250
All the evidence points to me now.

220
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,220
If I let Sima Jiao defend me,

221
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,820
it will stir resentment among the ministers

222
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,340
and give the Marquis of Nanyan an opening.

223
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,970
By choosing imprisonment myself,

224
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:06,740
I at least lessen suspicion.

225
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:10,340
Besides, I fear You Yan may try something

226
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,020
to make my demon core lose control.

227
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,230
It's safer for Sima Jiao if I stay away.

228
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,020
That must be Sima Jiao.

229
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,470
You two should go.

230
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,540
You came just like this?

231
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,430
No guards at all?

232
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,950
What if I really were an evil demon?

233
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,740
If you truly were a monster
who kills and drinks blood,

234
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,560
why would you target others?

235
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,410
Wouldn't the Heaven's chosen
sleeping beside you

236
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,430
be far more delicious?

237
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:11,210
Come. Let's go back together.

238
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,340
I will not let you stay in this filthy place.

239
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,520
No.

240
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:20,120
If I leave, the ministers will protest.

241
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:37,020
Noble Consort Si Xian's death
could never have been Madam Yan's doing.

242
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,940
For all your learning,

243
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,850
you still cannot read people,

244
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,940
and you imprisoned her?

245
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,890
Your Majesty, it was...

246
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:48,220
it was Madam Yan who asked to be imprisoned.

247
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,940
Nevertheless, this has indeed

248
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,040
helped prove her innocence.

249
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:58,780
The schemers will not set aside their hatred
just because of that.

250
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,110
Do you understand?

251
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:07,850
Yi Huo, visit the Marquis of Nanyan's manor
more often these days.

252
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:11,370
I fear he will put all the blame
for Noble Consort Si Xian's death

253
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:15,530
on Madam Yan and try something rash.

254
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,720
I will. Don't worry, Your Majesty.

255
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:24,890
Chen Tang, keep investigating
Noble Consort Si Xian's death.

256
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,570
Yes.

257
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:33,610
Also, see to it
that the prison food is well prepared,

258
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,880
and that her bedding is clean and comfortable.

259
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,600
Understood.

260
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,540
- Let go of me!
- Let go!

261
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,800
Let...

262
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,930
Quiet!

263
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,800
Let go of me!

264
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,210
Noble Consort Si Xian has only just died,

265
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,740
yet you have already gathered
so many boys and girls.

266
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,520
Thank you for your efforts.

267
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:20,300
I never thought my daughter

268
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,280
would die at the hands
of that demon, Liao Ting Yan.

269
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:27,430
If only I had acted sooner...

270
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:32,280
Now, she has died with hatred in her heart.

271
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:36,450
I must eliminate that demon, Liao Ting Yan,

272
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,390
and avenge my daughter.

273
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:43,580
I will bring you as many children as you need.

274
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,340
Rest assured, My Lord.

275
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,580
Just wait and see.

276
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,410
The Hu Kingdom is about to
fall into great chaos.

277
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,740
When that time comes,

278
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,560
you will be the sovereign who restores order.

279
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:59,970
Then I shall make Sima Jiao
and that demon lady pay with their lives

280
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,990
for my daughter's death.

281
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,750
I await your good news, Madam.

282
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:38,520
Liao Ting Yan, this is the great gift
I've prepared for you and Sima Jiao!

283
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,335
 

284
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,340
 I took the medicine Master gave me, 

285
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,640
 and the demonic energy was suppressed. 

286
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,710
 Why did it suddenly lose control? 

287
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,990
Mother!

288
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:31,360
This sudden drought and famine

289
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,880
must be You Yan's doing.

290
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,610
He did it to strengthen
my demon core through resentment,

291
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:41,690
and to undermine Sima Jiao's throne.

292
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:44,580
 The Spirit Fire and the demon core
restrain each other, 

293
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,060
 but the demon core can break free one day 

294
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,450
 and completely suppress the Spirit Fire. 

295
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,820
 If you do not want to lose your cultivation, 

296
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:55,740
 you must instead strengthen
the Spirit Fire within you 

297
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:59,500
 by burning it with your own blood as fuel. 

298
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,370
 But that would be like
using poison as medicine. 

299
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:04,820
 If you wish to
suppress the demon core entirely, 

300
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,800
 I fear it would take your very bones
and blood as a sacrifice. 

301
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:12,520
 Your life itself would burn away. 

302
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:48,060
Your Majesty, a severe drought
has struck Dushan County.

303
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,970
Many people have starved to death.

304
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:52,210
In several towns, bodies of boys and girls

305
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:55,020
were found in rice fields, gnawed upon.

306
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:59,100
It seems the starving people have begun

307
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,340
to exchange children for food.

308
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,340
Exchange children for food?

309
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:06,280
What a convenient excuse, General.

310
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:09,500
Your Majesty, I have investigated.

311
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,130
Those boys and girls

312
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:13,340
had already gone missing before the drought.

313
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,130
They appeared in the fields out of nowhere,

314
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:18,410
and their manner of death is exactly the same
as that of Noble Consort Si Xian.

315
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:21,970
This must be the work of a demon.

316
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:25,500
Your Majesty, I have been observing
the heavens these days.

317
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,210
A demonic star has appeared above the palaces.

318
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:32,610
This drought stemmed from that star.

319
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:35,580
If left unchecked,
it could bring the downfall of the kingdom.

320
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,060
I implore Your Majesty

321
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:41,260
to burn the demon lady, Liao Ting Yan,

322
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,470
and rid the people of this disaster.

323
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:06,190
The imperial palace

324
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,560
is not inhabited by Madam Yan alone.

325
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:18,190
How do you know that this demonic star
does not represent me?

326
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:23,930
Your Majesty,
your coming-of-age ceremony is imminent.

327
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:26,970
How can you still speak such nonsense?

328
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:29,060
Doesn't my foolishness

329
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,930
all the better highlight your wisdom?

330
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:36,060
Your Majesty, have you grown
so blinded by that demon lady

331
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:39,390
that you can't even accept well-meaning advice?

332
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,690
As I recall, just a while ago,

333
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:58,370
all of you praised Madam Yan
as a goddess descending to earth

334
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:00,210
and a blessing to all.

335
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:03,750
Now you revile her as a demon,

336
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,610
condemning her as a curse to the nation.

337
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:11,780
You take salaries and occupy high positions,

338
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,530
yet place the rise and fall of the Hu Kingdom

339
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:16,720
on the shoulders of one woman.

340
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:27,070
And you still dare tell me that you are
giving well-meaning advice?

341
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,180
General of the Household.

342
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,420
Yes, Your Majesty.

343
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,740
Open the granaries in Dushan County
and distribute grain.

344
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,050
Strengthen the defenses of the borders

345
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:41,330
to prevent bandits from causing trouble.

346
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:42,370
Understood.

347
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,650
- Chen Tang.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

348
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:47,850
Investigate the deaths
of the boys and girls as well.

349
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,960
Understood.

350
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,110
Marquis of Nanyan.

351
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:00,130
You have just lost your daughter.

352
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:02,700
You should rest more.

353
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,520
For the next few days,
you need not attend court.

354
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:12,630
Thank you for your concern, Your Majesty.

355
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:24,930
 You are so weak as a Soulshift cultivator. 

356
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:28,450
 One block and you failed. 

357
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:31,500
 Grandmaster, do you want to have some? 

358
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,530
 Too sweet. 

359
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:35,210
 Stop pretending. I can tell you want them. 

360
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:37,470
 If you crave them, I'll let you have your fill. 

361
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:42,470
 Zou Yan, stop slacking off. 

362
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:52,990
Why did I dream such strange things?

363
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,080
It worked.

364
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:09,880
The Spirit Fire has suppressed
the demon core in me.

365
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:14,170
What was so urgent you had to summon me?

366
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,430
Sit.

367
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:20,650
I want you to help Sima Jiao.

368
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:21,820
Take some demonic cultivators

369
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:24,640
and help ease the drought and famine
in the mortal world.

370
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,210
Those mortals all think you are an evil demon,

371
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:30,120
and you still want to help them?

372
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,820
They have only been blinded by You Yan.

373
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:36,060
The common people are innocent.

374
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,170
Besides, if rain falls from the heavens,

375
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:40,690
it will silence the rumors
that I am an evil demon.

376
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:41,860
Fine.

377
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,300
You are the Immortal-Demon Ruler.

378
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,300
I will do as you say.

379
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:49,040
But why do you look so pale?

380
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:53,670
Are you saying my skin
has become smoother and softer?

381
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,290
One more thing.

382
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:58,500
The deaths of those innocent boys and girls

383
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,450
must be connected to You Yan.

384
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:03,580
If you trace the aura left on them,

385
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,640
you may find his whereabouts.

386
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,950
I will leave this to you and Nian Jiu.

387
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,740
Got it.

388
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,080
Don't worry.

389
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,340
If it doesn't rain soon, not only the crops

390
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:24,020
but also the people will die.

391
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,020
Right.

392
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:29,100
His Majesty has been bewitched
by that demon lady,

393
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,840
and in the end, it is we commoners who suffer.

394
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:46,190
 This overwhelming resentment
really is You Yan's doing. 

395
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,300
It's raining!

396
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,210
- It's raining!
- It's raining!

397
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,370
It's raining!

398
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:18,780
Heaven has sent sweet rain!

399
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,690
- Wonderful!
- It's raining!

400
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:21,690
Heaven has sent sweet rain!

401
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:23,130
Finally it's raining!

402
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:25,450
- It's raining!
- We're saved!

403
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,060
- It's raining!
- Thank goodness!

404
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:31,360
- It's raining!
- It's raining!

405
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:36,610
Finally it's raining!

406
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,800
Finally it's raining!

407
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:49,260
Your Majesty, today's heavy rain
has eased the drought.

408
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,540
Also, as you decreed,

409
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,970
relief funds have been distributed
to the affected regions.

410
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:54,500
And thanks to the completed canal,

411
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,700
relief grain and supplies

412
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,540
reached the drought areas quickly.

413
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,810
Good.

414
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:01,100
Make sure inspections and audits are strict.

415
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,730
If there are any false disaster reports

416
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:05,090
or officials exploiting the people,
punish them severely.

417
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,130
Understood.

418
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:09,780
And what did you find out
about the dead children?

419
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:16,370
Your Majesty, I found that they were
all abducted or kidnapped.

420
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:18,180
I have already arrested the trafficker,

421
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:23,310
but he insists that he delivered them all to...

422
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,630
- Madam Yan.
- Absurd.

423
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,760
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

424
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:37,130
Clearly, whoever is behind this

425
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:39,560
is targeting Madam Yan.

426
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:44,260
This won't be the last attempt.

427
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,460
Search the kingdom from top to bottom

428
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,130
and find whoever is responsible.

429
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:49,180
Yes.

430
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:52,740
Your Majesty, I heard from
the Marquis of Nanyan's servants

431
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:55,810
that they sometimes
hear children crying at night.

432
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:58,260
Could this have something to do with him?

433
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:02,740
I understand that the Marquis of Nanyan
might want to frame Madam Yan,

434
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:06,830
but would he really have gone so far
as to kill Noble Consort Si Xian?

435
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:12,180
Chen Tang, keep following that lead
with the Marquis of Nanyan.

436
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,720
There may be things we don't yet know.

437
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:16,870
Yes.

438
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,590
Tomorrow is the coming-of-age ceremony.

439
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:28,050
Has Madam Yan been told of this?

440
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,560
What did she say?

441
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:35,570
Madam Yan said that
since she was under suspicion,

442
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:38,830
she would rather remain in prison.

443
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:03,370
First capping.

444
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:05,500
On this auspicious day,

445
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,780
you don the headpiece of adulthood.

446
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,780
Leave behind childish pursuits

447
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,810
and embrace virtue.

448
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:13,930
May you live long and prosper,

449
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:16,670
and may great blessings be yours.

450
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:24,190
Second capping.

451
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,260
In this favorable month and hour,

452
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:29,850
the headpiece is renewed.

453
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,700
Uphold your dignity

454
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,850
and guard your virtue with prudence.

455
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:35,850
May your years be countless

456
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:38,100
and your blessings enduring.

457
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,450
Third capping.

458
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:42,100
In the rightful year and in the blessed month,

459
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,490
you don the third headpiece of adulthood.

460
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:44,890
With your brothers beside you,

461
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:46,620
your virtue is fulfilled.

462
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,140
May your life be endless,

463
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,110
and may heaven bestow its grace upon you.

464
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:58,780
This is the royal crown passed down
from emperor to emperor in Hu.

465
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,260
Once His Majesty dons it,

466
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,850
he may worship the gods,

467
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:06,630
taking upon himself
the well-being of all his people.

468
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,370
 When I get out, 

469
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:16,000
 I'll kill you all! 

470
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,660
 If you are in such pain, 

471
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,810
 why don't you just kill me? 

472
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:26,290
 I have no reason to. 

473
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,740
 There's no grudge between us. 

474
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:31,810
 I told you, if I don't want you to die, 

475
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:33,140
 you won't die. 

476
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,620
 Boss... 

477
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:39,450
 Don't waste such a handsome face
looking so gloomy. 

478
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:40,920
 Ting Yan! 

479
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:45,850
 Ting Yan! 

480
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:46,700
 Ting Yan! 

481
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,180
 Your soul must still be here. 

482
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,580
 I will find it. 

483
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,490
 You can treat today 

484
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:54,890
 as our first encounter. 

485
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:56,810
 From now on, 

486
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:59,260
 I will create new memories for us, 

487
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:03,260
 memories that belong only to the present. 

488
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,450
 Why did you give me all your cultivation? 

489
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:09,540
 What I leave you
are the people and things you love. 

490
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,480
 Wherever you are, 

491
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:14,560
 I will always find my way back to you. 

492
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:30,670
 Long live the Emperor! 

493
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,550
Show yourself.

494
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:04,270
You dare ignore my words now,
you foolish snake?

495
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:08,810
Grandmaster, you've remembered everything?

496
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,890
Have your powers returned as well?

497
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:13,930
I'm still only mortal flesh and blood,

498
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:16,040
capable of a little magic.

499
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:22,480
That's why I need you to do something for me.

500
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,330
At your command, Grandmaster.

501
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:27,190
I want it to snow.

502
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,590
Ever since I started feeding
the Spirit Fire with my blood,

503
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:31,440
I've been having strange dreams
like this again and again.

504
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:35,190
What could it mean?

505
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:54,750
Madam Yan, the true killer
of Noble Consort Si Xian has been found.

506
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:57,700
You are free.

507
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,670
Did His Majesty find the culprit?

508
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:06,370
Did he capture You Yan?

509
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:08,290
Impossible.

510
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:13,150
Why not ask His Majesty yourself, Madam Yan?

511
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,920
This way, please.

512
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:33,150
Why is it suddenly snowing?

513
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,440
 Sima Jiao conjured the snow. 

514
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,480
 Has he regained his memories? 

515
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:54,840
 ♫ Mountains and rivers shatter before my eyes ♫ 

516
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:58,160
 ♫ Endless splendor
cultivated through lifetimes ♫ 

517
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,720
 ♫ Turns to dust between my fingers
in an instant ♫ 

518
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,400
 ♫ When the line
between good and evil is clear ♫ 

519
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,440
 ♫ Countless souls drift
into the boundless wilds ♫ 

520
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:14,920
 ♫ Carrying the spirit fire forward ♫ 

521
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:19,400
Ting Yan.

522
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,000
 ♫ Falling into love's abyss ♫ 

523
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,760
 ♫ Like heavy rain pouring down ♫ 

524
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,480
 ♫ Drunk on romance ♫ 

525
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,000
 ♫ In a blink, love and hate
vanish into illusion ♫ 

526
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 ♫ Falling into endless love ♫ 

527
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,360
 ♫ Stirring waves, upending a lifetime ♫ 

528
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,600
 ♫ Even if this life leads to ruin ♫ 

529
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:48,410
 ♫ I still choose to be entangled with you ♫ 

530
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:49,440
The rejuvenation spell?

531
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,040
 ♫ Through all lifetimes ♫ 

532
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,920
You remember now?

533
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,520
Are you finally done keeping secrets from me?

534
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,320
Yes.

535
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:14,920
In the years I lost my memory,

536
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:23,840
I came to know the bitterness and pain
of being left in the dark.

537
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:27,920
Only after living this life

538
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:31,670
did I realize how unbearable it felt.

539
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,270
So, today, I prepared this snowfall for you.

540
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:43,070
Take it as my apology, will you?

541
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:52,520
No.

542
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,960
You have no idea how much I suffered.

543
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:01,560
You left me tormented day and night
after losing you.

544
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:04,850
You secretly refined the Spirit Fire

545
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:06,660
and gave it all to me.

546
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,220
Weren't you afraid I would take it and leave,

547
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,520
leaving your soul to scatter into nothing?

548
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:13,590
That was the choice I gave you.

549
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:17,560
If you chose to endure pain just to keep me,

550
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,000
I would stay.

551
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:21,680
If not...

552
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:27,540
 ♫ I believe in each life
we'll fall in love again ♫ 

553
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:30,710
I would turn my soul
into a guiding light for you.

554
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:35,180
What I've given you is yours.

555
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,270
You are free to do with it as you will.

556
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:45,840
 ♫ For you, my tears still burn like fire ♫ 

557
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:49,080
 ♫ Destiny leads where my heart belongs ♫ 

558
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:56,080
 ♫ Awakened memories will never fade again ♫ 

559
00:42:56,080 --> 00:43:02,040
 ♫ Guiding the hope of love ♫ 

560
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:13,880
 ♫ The tale of fate keeps winding on ♫ 

561
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:19,920
You're always like this.

562
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:27,850
Even when the pain is killing you,

563
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:30,780
you bear it alone,

564
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:33,520
never letting anyone see.

565
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,450
I didn't understand before,

566
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:40,750
but now I do.

567
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:45,400
If the past was only pain for you,

568
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:49,230
why should I force you to remember it?

569
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:55,920
You once said you wanted to
live freely and happily.

570
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:04,220
Then why not live as an ordinary man,
safe and at peace, in this life?

571
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:06,750
Compared to losing my memories of you,

572
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:15,240
all the pain of the past means nothing.

573
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:20,840
 ♫ Longing runs wild in endless void ♫ 

574
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:25,280
 ♫ Then wish upon the stars ♫ 

575
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,680
 ♫ Reborn beyond souls ♫ 

576
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:34,760
 ♫ May this chain of enduring fate ♫ 

577
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:41,880
 ♫ Never replay heartbreak again ♫ 

578
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,640
 ♫ Autumn winds sigh ♫ 

579
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,720
 ♫ Moon and stars dapple the sky ♫ 

580
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,600
 ♫ Brushing the loneliness of bygone days ♫ 

581
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,560
 ♫ Candlelight flickers low ♫ 

582
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,800
 ♫ Shadows sway ♫ 

583
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,680
 ♫ Shimmering in the night ♫ 

584

 ♫ With a brush I draw ♫ 

585
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,640
 ♫ The color of light ♫

 ♫ Longing is engraved ♫ 

589

 ♫ Following ♫

 ♫ The veins of gravel ♫ 

592
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,640
 ♫ I turn into spirit fire ♫ 

593

 ♫ Burning away ♫
