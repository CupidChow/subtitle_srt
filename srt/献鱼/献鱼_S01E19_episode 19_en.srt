00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,700
 ♫ Heavens strike with thunderous wrath ♫ 

2
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,420
 ♫ Mountains and rivers shatter before my eyes ♫ 

3
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,780
 ♫ Endless splendor
cultivated through lifetimes ♫ 

4
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,540
 ♫ Turns to dust between my fingers
in an instant ♫ 

5
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,220
 ♫ When the line
between good and evil is clear ♫ 

6
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,340
 ♫ Countless souls drift

19
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:36,580
 

20
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,620
 

21
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,477
 

22
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,080
 The barrier is powerful. 

23
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,580
 Looks like the Spirit Fire is inside. 

24
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,740
 A Bloodmist Array. 

25
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,770
 A pool filled with the blood
of the Fengshan Clan. 

26
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,890
You are but a guard dog.

27
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,520
 You must promise me 

28
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,080
 not to tear open your wounds, stumble, or fall. 

29
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,930
 I'll be worried. 

30
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,740
Come in.

31
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,490
Who are you?

32
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:48,460
Jiao, come in, and I will tell you.

33
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,707
 

34
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,200
 The Spirit Fire 

35
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,050
 really is here. 

36
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,760
Jiao.

37
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,680
You've finally come.

38
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,710
Are you Sima Shi?

39
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,010
I've been waiting for you.

40
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,390
So, you didn't die
in the fire at White Deer Cliff.

41
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:46,120
So, E did as I asked

42
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,050
and merged the Spirit Fire with you.

43
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,250
I am so glad that you managed to pull through.

44
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,440
I'll get you out of here.

45
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,520
Don't bother.

46
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,370
I didn't wait for you
because I wanted to leave.

47
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,790
With this broken body of mine,

48
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,960
I could never leave again.

49
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,590
I lingered here, waiting,

50
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:17,660
just to tell you
what really happened back then.

51
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,270
The ascension curse
made the Sima clan dwindle further.

52
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,880
We, despite our precious blood,

53
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,200
fell from leaders
to mere tools of the Eight Palaces.

54
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,130
By my generation,

55
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,150
all freedom had been lost.

56
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:43,520
To produce a more refined Fengshan bloodline
to nourish the Spirit Fire,

57
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,830
the Eight Palaces forced
your mother and me into marriage.

58
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,960
Soon after,

59
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,590
you, with the purest Fengshan atavistic blood,

60
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,960
were born.

61
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,910
Seeing such purity,

62
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:01,660
the greed of the Eight Palaces

63
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,270
grew insatiable.

64
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,320
They wanted more offspring of this bloodline,

65
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,150
so they sealed your mother and me
in White Deer Cliff.

66
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,440
 The Sima clan must remain here
to guard the Spirit Fire. 

67
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,230
 Grandmaster, please stay on White Deer Cliff. 

68
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,590
 You are treating us like prisoners! 

69
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:21,930
 Do you even have
the slightest respect for us Grandmasters? 

70
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,960
I had intended to merge
with the Fengshan Spirit Fire

71
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,710
so that I could gain its power

72
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,320
and put an end to their scheme.

73
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,880
But the Spirit Fire was too powerful.

74
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,080
I could not endure the agony

75
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,420
and even fell into madness at one point.

76
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,400
In the end,

77
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,050
I had to give up.

78
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,130
And even knowing the pain,

79
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,680
you still chose to have me
merge with the Spirit Fire?

80
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,320
I... I had no other choice.

81
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,640
With your rare and pure
Fengshan atavistic blood,

82
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,200
you could withstand the Spirit Fire

83
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,440
and become the first
to break the ascension curse.

84
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,680
But during the fusion, we realized

85
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,230
that your blood was so pure

86
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:19,080
that you needed
a stronger Spirit Fire to merge with.

87
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,710
Otherwise, your blood would devour

88
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,150
the Spirit Fire entirely during the fusion.

89
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:31,320
So, the other Sima clansmen and I

90
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,680
made a collective decision.

91
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,280
 If our deaths can help Jiao
successfully merge with the Spirit Fire, 

92
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,230
 the Eight Palaces won't dare
to harm the Sima clan! 

93
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,200
 - That's right!
- We'll help Jiao merge with the Spirit Fire! 

94
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,110
 - Me too!
- Yes, me too! 

95
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:47,590
 - Me too!
- I'm in! 

96
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,320
The Sima clan no longer
allowed themselves to be pawns

97
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,440
for the greed of the Eight Palaces.

98
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,710
So, we decided to feed
the Spirit Fire with our blood

99
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,320
to form a Spirit Fire strong enough

100
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,750
for you to merge with.

101
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:07,710
But once the blood sacrifice began,

102
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:11,960
we found that the Spirit Fire
was like a bottomless pit.

103
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:18,590
Over a hundred clansmen gave their lives
one after another.

104
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,940
Not a single one gave up.

105
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,180
In the end,

106
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:28,220
the clansmen poured
every drop of their blood into it

107
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,290
and finally formed
the most powerful Spirit Fire in existence.

108
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,770
Sacrificing the entire clan

109
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:43,510
and leaving such a heavy burden on a child...

110
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,830
Should I call you pitiable, or despicable?

111
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,960
If we had to choose again,

112
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,860
we would still walk the same path.

113
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,960
Then why are you here?

114
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,800
I feared the Eight Palaces
would figure out our plan,

115
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,750
so I feigned madness and set a fire,

116
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,750
making them believe I had gone insane

117
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,800
and burned the whole clan alive.

118
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,740
The final step for merging
the Spirit Fire into you

119
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:23,980
required your mother to absorb it for you.

120
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:29,740
I thought our plan would end there.

121
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,400
 He's dead. 

122
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,800
 Oh, no. Where is Sima E? 

123
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,040
 - Hurry! 
- But in the fire at White Deer Cliff,

124
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,800
a spy the Shi family had planted
in the Eight Palaces

125
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,830
found me, barely alive,

126
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:58,160
and secretly took me away.

127
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,960
At first, the Shi family
truly meant to save me.

128
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,830
But once I was rescued,
I was desperate to find you,

129
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,470
and from me, Shi Yong You learned

130
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:09,060
the secret of how to break the ascension curse.

131
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:13,110
That greed consumed him.

132
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,280
Shi Yong You and his disciple, Shi Qian Lv,

133
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,560
stole a dying flame of the Spirit Fire's avatar

134
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,710
from White Deer Cliff

135
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:25,440
and used my body as the wick to keep it alive,

136
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,080
and at the same time...

137
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,700
At the same time...

138
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,280
Shi Yong You and Shi Qian Lv

139
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,110
secretly built Baifeng Mountain,

140
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,160
gathering the blood of the Fengshan Clan

141
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,890
to feed that Spirit Fire.

142
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,060
Exactly.

143
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,510
Now that you've come here,

144
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:47,470
it is time for all of this to end.

145
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:50,230
Jiao, remember this.

146
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,400
We are the Fengshan Clan.

147
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,510
The Fengshan Clan is born extraordinary,

148
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,680
destined to share life with heaven and earth.

149
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,650
Share life with heaven and earth?

150
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,990
Look around you.

151
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:08,400
Now the Sima clan has only me left.

152
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,080
So what if there is only you left?

153
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,870
As long as you can live
for tens of thousands of years,

154
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,630
as long as you don't die,

155
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,680
the Fengshan Clan will never vanish,

156
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,960
and the glory may one day be ours again.

157
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,230
Consume this Spirit Fire,

158
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,890
and not only will your wounds heal,

159
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,180
but you will also have
two Spirit Fires inside you.

160
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,740
But beyond becoming stronger,

161
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,230
there is another possibility.

162
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:43,110
If I consume it,

163
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,530
the Spirit Fire might reduce me
to ash in an instant.

164
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,510
Isn't that right?

165
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:54,340
You carry the atavistic Fengshan bloodline,
a marvel unseen in ages.

166
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:00,650
You can accomplish what none of us ever could.

167
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:06,260
 ♫ I'd bear no resentment or regret ♫ 

168
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:11,660
 ♫ Let my mortal heart fall to the human world ♫ 

169
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:18,900
 ♫ I'll trade it for a lone, fearless self
and let the past drift away ♫ 

170
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:25,660
 ♫ With every regret I once held onto ♫ 

171
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:31,780
 ♫ I'll survive countless trials
and tribulations ♫ 

172
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:38,500
 ♫ Let my mortal heart sink into the sea ♫ 

173
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:45,380
 ♫ I dream of a weightless self,
soaring to the heavens ♫ 

174
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,780
 ♫ Neither alive nor gone,
I'm bound only by endless loneliness ♫ 

175
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:52,140
 ♫ Watching the world change ♫ 

176
00:13:52,140 --> 00:14:04,500
 ♫ Yet still unable
to see through the long night ♫ 

177
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,180
Now your wish is fulfilled.

178
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,320
There's trouble at Taiwei Mountain.

179
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,980
Sect Master, Madam Ye sent word
that Liao Ting Yan had been found.

180
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,470
Order Ye Ru Ling to seize her
and bring her to Taixuan Peak at once.

181
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:42,200
Otherwise, all her clansmen
at Yin Palace will die.

182
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,490
Understood.

183
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,830
I can sense that something

184
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:51,080
has happened to the Spirit Fire
at Taiwei Mountain.

185
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,700
Sima Jiao may have already found it.

186
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,200
I'll go there first to check.

187
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,200
Notify the palace heads
to gather at Taixuan Peak

188
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,710
and set up an array.

189
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:03,590
Once Sima Jiao shows himself
at Taiwei Mountain,

190
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:07,160
I will use Liao Ting Yan
to draw him to Taixuan Peak.

191
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,830
Then, the palace heads
will capture him together.

192
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,100
Understood.

193
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,800
Could this mean something unexpected

194
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,770
will happen to Sima Jiao?

195
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,220
What kind of fool
curses her own cultivation partner?

196
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,080
He's so powerful.

197
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,700
No one in this world could kill him.

198
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,710
He might suffer a small injury,

199
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:51,110
but nothing serious will happen.

200
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,740
If only I still had the Transvision Mirror.

201
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,750
Then Jiao would be able to tell me he's safe.

202
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,560
Ru Ling!

203
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,060
 Nian Jiu? 

204
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,080
Ru Ling!

205
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,580
Ru Ling!

206
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,990
Nian Jiu!

207
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,470
Ting Yan!

208
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,800
Ting Yan!

209
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,180
Capture her!

210
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,830
Madam Ye, I didn't expect us
to meet again so soon.

211
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:28,230
How did you even find me?

212
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,590
In the Immortal Realm,

213
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,960
only I can recognize the traces
of your extreme-cold nature.

214
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,560
Your cultivation has advanced rapidly lately,

215
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,680
and the traces have become clearer than ever.

216
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,530
So, I should thank you for not coming
to capture me sooner?

217
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,750
The Sect Master said

218
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,350
that if we could not catch Sima Jiao,

219
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,890
we must at least bring Liao Ting Yan back.

220
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,630
Ting Yan!

221
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,640
Ting Yan!

222
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,100
You're courting death!

223
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,560
Madam Ye, whose side are you really on?

224
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,310
How dare you, a mere disciple, question me?

225
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:09,710
Yes, Sect Master Shi ordered you to watch me,

226
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:12,310
but he didn't tell you to command me,

227
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:16,230
and I certainly don't need
to explain my decisions to you.

228
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:18,270
Let's get back to business.

229
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,660
Take her away!

230
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,960
- Move.
- Let her go!

231
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,470
Ting Yan! Ting Yan!

232
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,090
Let me out!

233
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,470
Ru Ling!

234
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,030
Let Ting Yan go!

235
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,530
Ru Ling!

236
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,050
My Spirit Fire...

237
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,990
You are finally here.

238
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,790
You absorbed my Spirit Fire!

239
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:05,360
Centuries of planning,
and you walked away with the prize.

240
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,360
Sima Jiao, you vile, despicable man!

241
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,900
I am flattered.

242
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,473
 

243
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:37,790
Sima Jiao harmed my daughter,
causing me endless pain.

244
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:42,330
Now, I'll make him taste the same.

245
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,740
How can this be?

246
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,230
She has such powerful defenses.

247
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,030
I can't wound her at all.

248
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,200
Madam Yue, we're against a strong enemy.

249
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,600
Don't act rashly.

250
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,120
Madam Yue, if anyone here destroys this tool

251
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,230
meant for the capture of Sima Jiao,

252
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,640
I will have to treat them as a saboteur

253
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,070
of the Eight Palaces' grand plan.

254
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:17,010
Ye Ru Ling, whose side are you really on?

255
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,440
Even now, you still have sympathy
for Liao Ting Yan, don't you?

256
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,230
Madam Yue, now is not the time
for personal grudges.

257
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,030
We must focus on our task.

258
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,990
Master Ri is right.

259
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:31,750
Fellow palace heads, there is no time to waste.

260
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,140
Let's form the array.

261
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,230
Please notify Sect Master Shi at once
that Liao is in place,

262
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,380
and tell him to hurry
and lead Sima Jiao to Taixuan Peak.

263
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,900
Qian Lv, Madam Ye did it!

264
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,270
No!

265
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,640
No!

266
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,440
My... My Black Jade Lotus Pond!

267
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,750
A blood pool made
from the blood of the Sima clan

268
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:15,270
will also be destroyed
by the blood of the Sima clan.

269
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:19,940
Shi Qian Lv, this is only the beginning.

270
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,770
What are you trying to do?

271
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,050
Listen.

272
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,900
What's happening?

273
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,120
The spirit veins are burning!

274
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,600
Disciples of Moon Palace,

275
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,900
move away from the veins at once!

276
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,400
 Spirit veins burning? 

277
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,070
 That must be Sima Jiao. 

278
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,050
 I wonder how he is holding up. 

279
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,960
Liao Ting Yan must not be spared!

280
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,180
We don't have time. We must leave now!

281
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:47,790
The Shi clan's spiritual peaks,
temples, and tombs,

282
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:50,510
and even your Taixuan Peak,

283
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:53,790
will all be engulfed in fire.

284
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:57,310
From this day forward, your entire clan

285
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:01,180
and every spiritual peak you own will be gone.

286
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:07,600
Shi Qian Lv, how does it feel
to see everything you worked for

287
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,460
reduced to ash?

288
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:15,850
Sima Jiao, you've been planning this all along.

289
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,770
You will regret it!

290
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,160
Ting Yan, get up.

291
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,310
Go now.

292
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,030
Why are you saving me?

293
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,880
I told you I never wished to harm you.

294
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,840
- Go.
- Let's leave together.

295
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,440
I can't.

296
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,200
In order to manipulate me,

297
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,160
Shi Qian Lv brought my clansmen here.

298
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,180
I must stay with them.

299
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,740
Look out!

300
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,980
There's no way out.

301
00:24:55,230 --> 00:25:00,710
Sima Jiao, you think you've won, but hear this.

302
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:03,790
The woman you keep by your side

303
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:06,380
is also on Taixuan Peak.

304
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:14,490
If we die, she will die with us!

305
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,140
What did you say?

306
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,600
You schemed and schemed, yet you never foresaw

307
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,070
you would be the one
to kill the person you care for most, right?

308
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,600
How does that feel?

309
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,530
Your arrogance has brought you retribution!

310
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,090
Watch out!

311
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,900
 Sima Jiao. 

312
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:30,330
 This time, I can't wait for you to come home. 

313
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,220
Ting Yan.

314
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,710
Ting Yan.

315
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:05,050
Ting Yan.

316
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,380
Ting Yan.

317
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,510
Ting Yan!

318
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,900
Ting Yan...

319
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:39,180
The artifact couldn't
withstand my Spirit Fire...

320
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:56,100
 ♫ Why must we suffer all this? ♫ 

321
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,580
 ♫ Piercing us through every season ♫ 

322
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:05,180
 ♫ Longing runs wild in endless void ♫ 

323
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:10,060
 ♫ Then wish upon the stars ♫ 

324
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:13,360
Why can't I find you?

325
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,420
Why can't I find you?

326
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,660
Why can't I...

327
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:24,740
 ♫ Never replay heartbreak again ♫ 

328
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,900
Your soul must still be here.

329
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,980
I will find it.

330
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:54,540
 ♫ The tale of fate keeps winding on ♫ 

331
00:28:54,540 --> 00:29:00,500
 ♫ I'm unafraid though memories are gone ♫ 

332
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:07,940
 ♫ Through karma's journey,
all lifetimes share one gaze ♫ 

333
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:14,220
 ♫ I believe in each life
we'll fall in love again ♫ 

334
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:18,660
 ♫ Through every trial we've endured ♫ 

335
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:23,070
 ♫ No matter who has sought the cure ♫ 

336
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,880
Grandmaster!

337
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,400
Grandmaster!

338
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,620
Grandmaster.

339
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:30,810
Have you found Ting Yan's soul fragments?

340
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:36,100
 ♫ Destiny leads where my heart belongs ♫ 

341
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:42,990
Grandmaster, you've searched
the entire Celestial Palace,

342
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,490
but there is still no trace of her soul.

343
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:49,010
- Perhaps she really is...
- She's not dead.

344
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,990
She cannot be dead.

345
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:55,120
Grandmaster...

346
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,400
The two Spirit Fires in your body

347
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,840
haven't fully merged yet.

348
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,940
If you keep this up, you'll be in danger.

349
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,640
Keep looking for her.

350
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,750
Grandmaster... Grandmaster!

351
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,470
Grandmaster!

352
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:09,620
Grandmaster... Grandmaster!

353
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,220
Grandmaster!

354
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,270
That battle at Taiwei Mountain
 

355
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:25,990
shattered the spirit veins
and toppled the Celestial Palace.

356
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:30,510
After the Lord of Mercy lost
his cultivation partner, his spirit collapsed,

357
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:34,360
and he gave in to inner demons,
never waking again.

358
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:39,270
Just then, the Immortal-Demon Barrier cracked,
and demons broke in.

359
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:43,460
Gengchen Celestial Palace was
on the brink of destruction.

360
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,360
An He, we can't hold out much longer.
  A

361
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,360
Take the men back and fortify the defenses

362
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,510
to protect the Grandmaster.

363
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:10,120
- What about you, Nian Jiu?
- I can still hold out a little longer.

364
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,660
Go!

365
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,920
You Chi, the Demon Lord,
and his Preceptor, Ming Li,

366
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,750
recently seized another city.

367
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,360
If the Grandmaster doesn't wake soon,

368
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,740
the Celestial Palace might really fall.

369
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:41,030
Who would have thought
that a place once so glorious

370
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:43,230
would end up like this?

371
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:45,960
- If only the Grandmaster were awake.
- Yeah.

372
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,600
They say the Grandmistress's death
struck him hard,

373
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,750
and something went wrong
with the new Spirit Fire inside him.

374
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,440
That's why he fell into a deep sleep.

375
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,750
If she were still here,

376
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:57,470
perhaps he would have awakened sooner.

377
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:59,050
Yeah.

378
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,580
 Grandmaster. 

379
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,660
 Ting Yan. 

380
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:07,290
 Grandmaster! 

381
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,620
 Grandmaster! 

382
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,710
 Boss. 

383
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:17,030
 Sima Jiao. 

384
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,030
 Jiao. 

385
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,380
 Jiao. 

386
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,200
 Jiao! 

387
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,580
 Come! 

388
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:29,070
 ♫ Endless splendor
cultivated through lifetimes ♫ 

389
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,850
 Good morning, Jiao. 

390
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:36,780
 ♫ When the line
between good and evil is clear ♫ 

391
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,310
 I told you, 

392
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:42,420
 as long as I don't let you die, 

393
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:45,330
 you won't die. 

394
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,220
 Your soul must still be here. 

395
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,860
 I will find it. 

396
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:04,060
 ♫ I still choose to be entangled with you ♫ 

397
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,660
Take it slow.

398
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,790
- Master Yuan.
- How are things at the front?

399
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:24,270
Hundreds of demon soldiers
have invaded the front line.

400
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,510
They will soon reach here.

401
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:28,440
Hundreds? Even with the disciples
from the reserve force,

402
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,070
we only have a few dozen soldiers here.

403
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:34,470
Master Yuan, please place
all remaining forces under my command.

404
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,710
Together with Hei Nian Jiu,

405
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:37,960
I will defend the Celestial Palace
to the death.

406
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:45,880
 Defend the Celestial Palace to the death! 

407
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,250
Very well.

408
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,790
We've cultivated for so long.

409
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:52,600
If we die now protecting the Celestial Palace,

410
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,770
it will be a worthwhile death.

411
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,960
They're here.

412
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,990
Everyone, protect the Grandmaster!

413
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,660
Yes, General!

414
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:49,180
The Spirit Fire? It's the Grandmaster.

415
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,500
Did you really think I was dead?

416
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,280
Greetings, Grandmaster!

417
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,450
 Greetings, Grandmaster! 

418
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,030
Grandmaster.

419
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:19,880
Grandmaster, you're awake.

420
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,070
Why are you crying?

421
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:33,220
Grandmaster, have the two Spirit Fires
in your body completely merged?

422
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,500
Where's Ting Yan?

423
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,110
Have you found her?

424
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:44,410
Grandmaster, have you forgotten?

425
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:48,240
Ting Yan left behind no fragments

426
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,150
of her soul at all.

427
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:52,990
She cannot be reborn.

428
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:54,770
And Ru Ling...

429
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,970
She met the same fate.

430
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:09,240
What about the Shi clan?

431
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,030
After the battle at Taiwei Mountain,

432
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:14,550
the Shi clan was nearly annihilated.

433
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:17,320
But we searched every corner
of the Celestial Palace

434
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,550
and never found Shi Qian Lv's body.

435
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,920
I believe he must be living under another name,

436
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,240
hiding somewhere in the Celestial Palace.

437
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,450
Having caused such upheaval,

438
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:29,890
Shi Qian Lv cannot remain here.

439
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,110
The breaches in the barrier

440
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,550
were perfect for him to escape.

441
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,320
Grandmaster, are you saying...

442
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,850
We'll go to the Demon Realm

443
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,960
to root out the trouble.

444
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:47,150
Grandmaster, though my medical skills
are modest,

445
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:51,670
I beg to accompany you
to safeguard your health.

446
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:54,030
Grandmaster, you have only just awakened.

447
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:56,020
Are you sure about this?

448
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,960
Do you object?

449
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,630
I wouldn't dare.

450
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:03,280
But I have one request.

451
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,030
During the Immortal-Demon War,

452
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:07,150
many people of the Celestial Palace
were taken into the Demon Realm

453
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,770
and went missing.

454
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,510
Grandmaster, I humbly ask

455
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:17,110
that you build a refuge for them
within the Demon Realm

456
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,290
if you encounter them there.

457
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:40,250
I never intended to destroy this place.

458
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,770
But in the end,

459
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:45,280
this is what it has come to.

460
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,510
This isn't your fault, Grandmaster.

461
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:50,960
Back then, the Immortal-Demon Barrier
was suddenly destroyed.

462
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,110
And after you fell into slumber,

463
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:54,630
the Demon Lord set his sights on our territory.

464
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,930
That's why so many lives were lost.

465
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:11,030
Grandmaster, did you just mend
the Immortal-Demon Barrier?

466
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:13,470
The Grandmaster doesn't seem
as fearsome as the rumors say.

467
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:15,990
The Grandmistress was kind, gentle,
and disliked bloodshed.

468
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:17,960
It was because of her that he changed.

469
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,100
What a pity that fate was so cruel.

470
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,665
 

471
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:40,030
My lord.

472
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:43,840
Ming Li, it has been centuries.

473
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,880
When will I be reborn?

474
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,550
My lord, in the Demon Realm, White Bone Abyss
holds the richest demonic energy.

475
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,510
Please rest and recuperate here.

476
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:52,760
Don't worry, my lord.

477
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,190
Everything is ready
for the restoration of your soul.

478
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:58,360
Now we only need Sima Jiao's Fengshan blood.

479
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,840
He's slept for 18 years.

480
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,800
18 years have passed,

481
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,670
and you still haven't brought him to me?
 

482
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:09,990
My lord, he has awakened recently,

483
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:13,550
and he has even successfully merged
the two Spirit Fires.

484
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:15,060
Useless fool!

485
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:18,590
Please calm your anger, my lord.

486
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,630
We still have the Frost Fish.

487
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,510
She can kill him and take his blood.

488
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:25,190
You have searched for her
for so many years without success.

489
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:27,320
She must already be dead.

490
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,190
No, I'm sure she is still alive.

491
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:33,070
The traces of her extreme-cold nature
left at the Immortal-Demon Barrier's breaches

492
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:36,110
were proof that she passed through the barrier
into the Demon Realm

493
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,990
during the great disaster 18 years ago.

494
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:41,150
But she must have been gravely injured,

495
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:43,240
which is why we haven't been able
to track her down.

496
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,320
There is only one Frost Fish in existence.

497
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,760
She is the perfect weapon to kill Sima Jiao.

498
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,880
You must find her.

499
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:55,990
However, now that Sima Jiao
has two Spirit Fires within him,

500
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:58,550
even with the Frost Fish,
we won't be able to kill him.

501
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:02,660
We'll need the aid
of an ancient demonic artifact.

502
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,030
Follow the map to find the Xingtian Chain.

503
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:13,360
Once the Frost Fish
is refined into a frost stone

504
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,590
and set into the Xingtian Chain,

505
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:17,470
Sima Jiao can be killed.

506
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:21,400
Then you'll drain his blood
and provide the sacrifice I need.

507
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,030
I will depart at once.

508
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:25,550
Rest assured, my lord.
I will rally the strength of the entire clan

509
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:27,740
to find that Frost Fish, Liao Ting Yan.

510
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:33,633
 

511
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,804
 

512
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:45,180
Stop running!

513
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:48,400
Hand it over!

514
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,220
- Pretty lady...
- Let go of me!

515
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,360
Please, have mercy.

516
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,740
Out of the way!

517
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,220
Eat.

518
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,760
We're almost out of food again.

519
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,150
After finishing this job,
I'll need to find more work.

520
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:12,630
Winter City is far.

521
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:15,030
Leave early and return early.

522
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:18,190
Be careful on the road.

523
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:20,240
Don't get yourself hurt.

524
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,810
I won't, Father.

525
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,700
 ♫ Autumn winds sigh ♫ 

526
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,620
