1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The world is broken in front of me

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The golden thread is left behind

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The golden thread is left behind

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The love is cut off, the love is cut off

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The love is cut off, the love is cut off

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
When the thread is cut off, the love is cut off

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
When the thread is cut off, the love is cut off

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
When the thread is cut off, the love is cut off

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
When the thread is cut off, the love is cut off

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
When the thread is cut off, the love is cut off

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
When the thread is cut off, the love is cut off

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
When the thread is cut off, the love is cut off

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
When the thread is cut off, the love is cut off

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
When the thread is cut off, the love is cut off

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Love is complete

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Like a big fish, floating between the sky and the earth

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The wind and the moon are the most distant

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But between them, love can be changed

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Who loves the moon?

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The time that is hot and cold for a lifetime

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Even if this life is endless, not to be met

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Others want to be with you

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,800
Un gains d에서È÷÷÷

24
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,520
have I gone missing?

25
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,160
It's said to be a cold pond.

26
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,040
The water temperature is just right.

27
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,240
It's been a long time since I felt like I was on vacation.

28
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,400
I can actually use the divine stone.

29
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,280
It seems that the pill is really strange.

30
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,080
I know it stinks.

31
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,600
I'll laugh at you when I get back.

32
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,640
Why can't I get through?

33
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,120
That's dangerous.

34
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,400
What's more dangerous than the immortal's mansion?

35
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,040
I set up a protective barrier

36
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,160
for your divine stone.

37
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,480
But why does it feel like it's gone?

38
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,480
Of course.

39
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,160
You were poisoned by the devil

40
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,880
and drank my blood.

41
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,000
You ate the blood lily

42
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,760
and threw it into the flower.

43
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,520
You've been through this before.

44
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,760
I accidentally entered my spiritual mansion

45
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,040
and found your blood lily.

46
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,480
Why?

47
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,200
You're panicking.

48
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,160
Do you know what this means?

49
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,640
I don't.

50
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,400
You forgot.

51
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,800
When you're emotional,

52
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,480
I can hear

53
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,280
what you're thinking.

54
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,720
You're telling yourself

55
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,080
to be steady

56
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,040
and not panic.

57
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,640
Maybe you can feel it.

58
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,960
Even if you're trying to help me,

59
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,040
you'll get close to me

60
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,520
and rely on me

61
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,400
when you're trying to help me.

62
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,320
Because

63
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,960
your spiritual power

64
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,920
is still in my flower.

65
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,360
How did we get along?

66
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,880
We were just friends.

67
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,400
That's it.

68
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,400
What?

69
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,320
That's what you think.

70
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,440
I didn't think anything.

71
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,360
We've...

72
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:51,920
We've already...

73
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,680
What?

74
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,760
You know.

75
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,120
I don't.

76
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,520
I don't.

77
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,080
You've been through my spiritual mansion?

78
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,800
The capital.

79
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,720
What's going on?

80
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,440
There's a picture in my head.

81
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:19,840
No.

82
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,080
I can't think about it.

83
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,960
He seems to hear my heart.

84
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,360
Let's go.

85
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,560
But I don't remember anything.

86
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,480
Actually, you have a way to help me recover my memory.

87
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,560
Right?

88
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,360
Then why don't you do that?

89
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,720
That way, you can achieve the result you want faster.

90
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,560
Indeed.

91
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,280
But you have your own way.

92
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,240
What if I can't remember it all the time?

93
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,760
It's okay.

94
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,880
We have plenty of time

95
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,800
to start over.

96
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,640
Calm down.

97
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,800
Young Master Fengqi,

98
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,880
you'd better open your mind.

99
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,160
Besides, he seems to have forgotten

100
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,800
his Korean memory.

101
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,440
That's why he can't recognize you.

102
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,160
What a pity.

103
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,000
What a fate.

104
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,360
I've been told that

105
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,800
I can't recognize you.

106
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,120
I'm sorry.

107
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,360
I'm sorry.

108
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,520
I'm sorry.

109
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,240
I'm sorry.

110
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:22,880
I'm sorry.

111
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,640
I'm sorry.

112
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,400
I'm sorry.

113
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,240
I'm sorry.

114
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm sorry.

115
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,640
I'm sorry.

116
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,440
I'm sorry.

117
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,080
I was badly hurt before.

118
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,320
And all my memories have disappeared.

119
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,200
According to Sima Jiao,

120
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:53,120
I was his

121
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,320
harem.

122
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,600
The National Bikach gave me my chance of survival.

123
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,200
And you

124
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,120
are my motivation to survive.

125
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,840
Let's continue our food-vacation.

126
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,600
The younger one...

127
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,800
The younger one.

128
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,160
I promise I'll take good care of him for you.

129
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,760
Good luck, man.

130
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,960
Don't regard it as your strongly description.

131
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:46,920
No, I...

132
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,040
I've looked for him for a long time.

133
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,480
Now he's not around.

134
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,080
Official's office

135
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,200
What brings you here, young lord Feng!

136
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,040
Please deliver my message.

137
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,440
I want to see rate-c你说er.

138
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,560
Yes.

139
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:45,540
Guo

140
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,160
Your Ladyship,

141
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,040
long time no see.

142
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,560
You have gained rememberness and absence.

143
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:55,840
Come on.

144
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,640
Come on.

145
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,200
Let's go.

146
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,640
He is setting our land

147
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,840
as his check point.

148
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,040
State Preceptor.

149
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,240
I'm so angry.

150
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,440
Get up.

151
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,880
I'll never forget

152
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,520
your kindness in saving me.

153
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,880
You're welcome.

154
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,480
I heard that you're willing to cooperate with us

155
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,720
to help Han Yu recover his memory.

156
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,200
That's right.

157
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,520
May I ask

158
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,200
why you helped me

159
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,280
to recover A Yan's memory?

160
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,880
To help him regain his memory,

161
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,960
he killed Sima Jiao to get the blood.

162
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,640
He used the words of the late Demon Lord

163
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,480
to complete the Blood Skill.

164
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,120
Blood Skill?

165
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,200
In order to continue his power and rule,

166
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,280
the ancestors of the Demon Clan

167
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,000
would let the State Preceptor separate his soul

168
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,880
and put it into the body of the descendants of the Demon Clan.

169
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,360
The whole process

170
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,840
needs to be done in the Blood Pool of the White Bone Courtyard.

171
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,040
Blood Skill?

172
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,760
That's why it's called Blood Skill.

173
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,280
The late Demon Lord, You Yan,

174
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,200
was killed by the fire.

175
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,520
So he spent a long time recovering.

176
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,000
He never recovered.

177
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,000
The blood in the Blood Pool dried up.

178
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,240
In order to make the late Demon Lord

179
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,720
recover his soul as soon as possible,

180
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,520
we need the blood of the most nourishing

181
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,240
Fengshan in the world

182
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,280
to fill the Blood Pool again.

183
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,360
So you want to kill Sima Jiao

184
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,840
to get his blood?

185
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,680
Yes.

186
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,240
And

187
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,920
it's not just about using the blood of the You family

188
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,520
to take the soul of the late Demon Lord.

189
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,880
It also requires the Chang family to open the Blood Skill.

190
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,320
I wonder if Young Master Feng

191
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,280
is willing to help us.

192
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,160
The one who killed my whole clan is You Qi.

193
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,720
As the descendant of the Chang family,

194
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,080
Feng Qi has never been

195
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,520
suspicious of the late Demon Lord.

196
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,440
It's rare that Young Master Feng is willing to help His Majesty.

197
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,720
After all,

198
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,200
he's a little bit of a failure.

199
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,160
His years of grudge has been wasted again.

200
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,200
But I never thought

201
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,360
you would be so kind to that little fish.

202
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,360
Back then,

203
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,560
it was you who gave me a chance to survive.

204
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,400
But it was also A Yan

205
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,640
who gave me hope and courage to survive.

206
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,480
I thought

207
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,440
I would never see him again.

208
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,480
But now I meet him again in the Hexian City.

209
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,800
I think

210
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,480
it must be destined by God.

211
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,160
What should I do next?

212
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,040
Please tell me.

213
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,560
mejue

214
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,840
Si Ma Jiao.

215
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,880
Do you think your spirit energy is really good?

216
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,160
You can't handle it.

217
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,720
Why do you put on so much spirit energy?

218
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,720
Even if you put two

219
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,440
specified deficit on your spirit power,

220
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,240
Your body can be consumed

221
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,520
through the upgrading of BE THE Scott Award.

222
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:42,760
Shut up.

223
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,280
Don't you understand?

224
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,400
It is a small thing that your wound is hardly healed.

225
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,440
If you get more serious

226
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,880
from now on you will always have Ты

227
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,880
Who else can hurt me at this time?

228
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,880
Don't pretend to be strong at this time.

229
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,880
I warn you.

230
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,880
If you want to continue to be stable and sweet with your woman,

231
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,880
you should use your spiritual power less.

232
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,880
I don't want to be with you.

233
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,880
Don't mention the fire of the two-stripped spirit to her.

234
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,880
A Yan, someone is looking for you.

235
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,880
The soul will not disappear.

236
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,880
I just bought it back.

237
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,880
I met this person at the door.

238
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,880
He said he wanted to see you.

239
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,880
My name is Heng Lin.

240
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,880
Greetings to the noble lady.

241
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,880
Aren't you the one from the black market?

242
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,880
Do you know where Gu Yuwu is?

243
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,880
Why are you here?

244
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,880
I heard you came to the east city.

245
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,880
So I came to you.

246
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,880
I came here to ask for an audience.

247
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,880
I invited you to Gu Yuwu.

248
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,880
It's no use to find me now.

249
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,880
I haven't collected the money to go to Gu Yuwu.

250
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,880
A Yan,

251
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,880
the place you said you would go to is Gu Yuwu.

252
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,880
That's right.

253
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,880
I was wrong about Taishan.

254
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,880
I didn't know you were the Taoist priest of the Zizang Daoist Army.

255
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,880
So I followed the general rules

256
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,880
and asked for 2000 demon masters.

257
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,880
The noble lady, Dongyang Zhenren, is also in Gu Yuwu.

258
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,880
She knew you were in the Demon Realm.

259
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,880
She sent me here to invite you.

260
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,880
Dongyang Zhenren?

261
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,880
I'm the one?

262
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,880
That's right.

263
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,880
Greetings, Master.

264
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,880
How's the relationship between me and Zhenren?

265
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,880
He was not mean to you before.

266
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,880
Master, Madam.

267
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,880
If you two can come,

268
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,880
it's a great honor for us.

269
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,880
We can go on a vacation.

270
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,880
That's great.

271
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,880
I can also follow Madam Shizu.

272
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,880
I will go with you.

273
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,880
Follow me.

274
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,880
Look at those people.

275
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,880
They are so beautiful and fresh.

276
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,880
But they seem to be quite annoying.

277
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,880
It's a good place for a vacation.

278
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,880
Meng Lin, you're back.

279
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,880
You brought so many guests.

280
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,880
I'm back.

281
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,880
They are our distinguished guests.

282
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,880
Please come in.

283
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,880
Come on, this way.

284
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,880
You come here?

285
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,880
Look at this.

286
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,880
You're so handsome.

287
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,880
You're so handsome.

288
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,880
You're so handsome.

289
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,880
You're so handsome.

290
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,880
You're so handsome.

291
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,880
You're so handsome.

292
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,880
The flowers here are so beautiful.

293
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,880
Yes.

294
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,880
Meng Lin.

295
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,880
Meng Lin.

296
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,880
You're so tall.

297
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,880
Let me see you.

298
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,880
Come on.

299
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,880
You too.

300
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,880
Come on, let's go this way.

301
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,880
Come on.

302
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,880
Come on.

303
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,880
I brought you some delicious food.

304
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,880
What's delicious?

305
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,880
We have everything.

306
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,880
Who wants to eat?

307
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,880
Fengqi looks like a fish in water.

308
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,880
Look.

309
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,880
He doesn't even care about your master.

310
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,880
He's so handsome.

311
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,880
The Fengqi is more than a fish.

312
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,880
He's always been in front of Ting Yan.

313
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,880
So handsome.

314
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,880
Master, let's take Ting Yan away.

315
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,880
We can't leave now.

316
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,880
If we leave now,

317
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,880
we'll be clearly showing weakness to Fengqi.

318
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,880
Do you understand?

319
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,880
If you don't understand, don't make up your mind.

320
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,880
Come with me.

321
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,880
So handsome.

322
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,880
Come on.

323
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,880
Let's play together.

324
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,880
Okay.

325
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,880
Is it delicious?

326
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,880
Delicious.

327
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,880
Delicious.

328
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,880
Come on.

329
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,880
Eat.

330
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,880
There are many.

331
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,880
I'll take yours.

332
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,880
Come on.

333
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,880
Hold it.

334
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,880
Ting Yan.

335
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,880
This is for you.

336
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,880
It's really you.

337
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,880
You are my master.

338
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,880
It's only been 18 years.

339
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,880
You forgot about me.

340
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,880
I'm sorry.

341
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,880
I had something wrong before.

342
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,880
I don't remember what happened before.

343
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,880
Did you forget me too?

344
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,880
Come and help me.

345
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,880
Say something.

346
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,880
I've been away from my master for a long time.

347
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,880
I was so excited.

348
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,880
I didn't realize that my master was also here.

349
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,880
I was wrong.

350
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,880
I was separated from my family.

351
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,880
I was here with my master.

352
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,880
I didn't expect to see my master again one day.

353
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,880
Dongyang, what happened?

354
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,880
Masters,

355
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,880
I've invited the Taoist priest and his Taoist bride.

356
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,880
Greetings, Taoist priest.

357
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,880
Greetings, Taoist priest.

358
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,880
Who is Taoist priest?

359
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,880
I don't know.

360
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,880
Taoist priest came from afar.

361
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,880
Is there anything important to do?

362
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,880
I'm just here to spend time with Ting Yan.

363
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,880
Don't be so nervous.

364
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,880
Please get up.

365
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,880
Spend time?

366
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,880
Adjust your posture.

367
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,880
Relax your body and mind.

368
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,880
Adjust my posture and relax my body and mind.

369
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,880
I'm just here to...

370
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,880
I'm just here to take a vacation.

371
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,880
Take a vacation.

372
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,880
Haozi.

373
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,880
Haozi.

374
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,880
May I ask how long you plan to stay in Guyuwu?

375
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,880
Depends on his mood.

376
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,880
Taoist priest, everyone.

377
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,880
Please allow me to take you to rest.

378
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,880
Take a rest?

379
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,880
Later, we will host the banquet for you.

380
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,880
But Guyuwu is not like other places.

381
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,880
Only some ordinary vegetables, fruits and raw materials.

382
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,880
We are not good enough.

383
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,880
Please forgive us.

384
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,880
How about we have barbecue together?

385
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,880
I happen to have a lot of barbecue.

386
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,880
Just bring some vegetables and meat you grow.

387
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,880
Since the disciple said so,

388
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,880
let's hold the barbecue party.

389
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,880
Master, what do you think?

390
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,880
What do you think?

391
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,880
I agree with Master.

392
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,880
Then I will go with the masters to prepare.

393
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,880
Yes.

394
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,880
You are so crazy.

395
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,880
You take a rest here.

396
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,880
I will tell them.

397
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,880
I will be back later.

398
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,880
Alright, let's go.

399
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,880
Let's go play.

400
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,880
Master.

401
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,880
I wonder if you have any other orders?

402
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,880
Guyuwu's masters are all here?

403
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,880
Yes, they are all here.

404
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,880
You sent Henglin to Guyuwu with Liao Tingyan.

405
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,880
What is your purpose?

406
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,880
I just heard that Tingyan's disciple was in the Demon Citadel.

407
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,880
So I want him to be here.

408
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,880
To live here.

409
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,880
We have no bad intentions.

410
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,880
That's true.

411
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,880
Master and Lady Master have special identities.

412
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,880
It's good to be cautious.

413
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,880
Guyuwu is a place

414
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
where we can be favored by our masters and ladies.

415
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,880
Thank you for your attention.

416
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,880
Master.

417
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,880
We will do our best to take care of you.

418
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,880
This is really the Peach Garden of the Demon Citadel.

419
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,880
Do you like this place?

420
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,880
Yes.

421
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,880
There are no corpses on the road.

422
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,880
No burning, killing and robbing.

423
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,880
People here are all living in peace.

424
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,880
The sun is shining.

425
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,880
The air is full of fragrance.

426
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,880
It's the best place to live.

427
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,880
If you like it,

428
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,880
the Immortal Realm and the Demon Realm

429
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,880
can be the Peach Garden you want.

430
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,880
Stop making up stories.

431
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,880
I'm already satisfied

432
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,880
with being able to spend time in Guyuwu.

433
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,880
My destiny is

434
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,880
that I will live in the wild and peaceful place.

435
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,880
It's a fun day.

436
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,880
You are getting more and more like the old days.

437
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,880
What was I like in the past?

438
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,880
You always talk nonsense.

439
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,880
You can't get tired,

440
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,880
but you can only sleep.

441
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,880
Thanks to you.

442
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,880
What is this?

443
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,880
Open it.

444
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,880
Do I have to eat so much?

445
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,880
I can't grow up

446
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,880
after eating this.

447
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,880
You can't do this.

448
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,880
Your blood won't be enough.

449
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,880
These are just for taste.

450
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,880
No need to use blood.

451
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,880
That's like eating a lonely fish.

452
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,880
Don't you like its taste?

453
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,880
Just eat it as a candy.

454
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,880
Eat it.

455
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,880
Let them make more when you're done.

456
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,880
Too much candy will make it bitter.

457
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,880
It will taste better

458
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,880
if you eat it slowly.

459
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,880
Come on.

460
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,880
What are you doing?

461
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,880
This is for cutting.

462
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,880
It will look good.

463
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,880
Fengqi, make more of this.

464
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,880
I want to eat this.

465
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,880
Is it cooked?

466
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,880
Yes.

467
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,880
Give Dao Jun two new ones.

468
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,880
Here, Dao Jun.

469
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,880
Smells good.

470
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,880
Lamb skewers.

471
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,880
This is lamb skewers.

472
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,880
It's good for weight loss.

473
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,880
You're silly.

474
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,880
Where is the meat?

475
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,880
You eat it like this.

476
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,880
Senior sister,

477
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,880
which one do you think

478
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,880
is better?

479
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,880
Which one is better?

480
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,880
It's not important.

481
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,880
We were arguing

482
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,880
who can call the green ginseng

483
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,880
as the real green ginseng.

484
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,880
Senior sister,

485
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,880
taste it.

486
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,880
Try it.

487
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,880
It's sweet and crispy.

488
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,880
I think

489
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,880
it's called green ginseng sweet and crispy.

490
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,880
Thank you, senior sister.

491
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,880
Enjoy it.

492
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,880
Thank you, senior sister.

493
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,880
Junior sister,

494
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,880
there's a reason for you.

495
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,880
Come on, try the little yellow beef

496
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,880
that senior brother raised.

497
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,880
Just now,

498
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,880
my senior sister

499
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,880
has marinated it well.

500
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,880
And with the

501
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,880
wine from Gu Yu House,

502
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,880
it tastes very good.

503
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,880
My senior brother

504
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,880
rarely kills his precious

505
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,880
fresh beef to eat.

506
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,880
We can't eat

507
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,880
these fresh beef ourselves.

508
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,880
Come on,

509
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,880
eat it.

510
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,880
Eat it.

511
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,880
If you don't eat it,

512
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,880
come on, drink it.

513
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,880
Don't be rude.

514
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,880
Come on.

515
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,880
You two

516
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,880
have never been out of Gu Yu House.

517
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,880
You don't know who this god is.

518
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,880
You are so rude.

519
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,880
It's okay.

520
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,880
You two don't know.

521
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,880
He doesn't usually eat these things.

522
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,880
So these are all mine.

523
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,880
He doesn't drink.

524
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,880
I'll drink with you.

525
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,880
Today's banquet

526
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,880
is rare to meet his master again.

527
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,880
I'll drink with him.

528
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,880
That's great.

529
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,880
I think I have a reason too.

530
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,880
Senior sister,

531
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,880
is it difficult to find a reason?

532
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,880
It shouldn't be difficult.

533
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,880
Don't ask if you shouldn't ask.

534
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,880
Senior sister,

535
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,880
I think it's not difficult.

536
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,880
I think

537
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,880
it's not difficult.

538
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,880
I think

539
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,880
it's not difficult.

540
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,880
Senior sister,

541
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,880
how did you

542
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,880
get together with your Taoist?

543
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,880
Are you still busy?

544
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,880
Go.

545
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,880
Go.

546
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,880
Why are you laughing?

547
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,880
They seem to be afraid of you.

548
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,880
Whoever knows my name

549
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,880
is not afraid of me.

550
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,880
I'm not afraid of you.

551
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,880
You're not afraid of me?

552
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,880
I'm not afraid.

553
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,880
You're so afraid.

554
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,880
Master,

555
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,880
Master Tian Yan,

556
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,880
come and taste this duck.

557
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,880
This place is not as good as the previous house.

558
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,880
It's not as good as the previous house.

559
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,880
We've been working hard

560
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,880
in this house

561
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,880
to raise some green duck.

562
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,880
It's very tender and delicious.

563
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,880
Let me try it.

564
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,880
It's delicate,

565
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,880
tender and juicy.

566
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,880
It's delicious.

567
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,880
My tongue is going to fall off.

568
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,880
How do you know what I'm going to say?

569
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,880
This duck is really delicious.

570
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,880
And it seems to be very nourishing.

571
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,880
It feels like the body has regained its energy.

572
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,880
Master,

573
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,880
there's something delicious here.

574
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,880
Let's go.

575
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,880
Coming.

576
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,880
Thank you.

577
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,880
Master, are you okay?

578
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,880
I'm fine.

579
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,880
If this continues,

580
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,880
Tian Yan will find out.

581
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,880
Don't talk too much.

582
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,880
The spirit of everyone's desire

583
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,880
is really not a good thing.

584
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,880
I'm sorry.

585
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,880
Let me tell you.

586
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,880
Our lives are so dangerous now.

587
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,880
It's all because of the family and friends.

588
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,880
Don't you think so?

589
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,880
Yes.

590
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,880
Tian Yan.

591
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,880
How are you doing in Gu Yuwu today?

592
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,880
It's been a long time since I've been here.

593
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,880
I'm fine.

594
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,880
I'm fine.

595
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,880
I'm fine.

596
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,880
I'm fine.

597
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,880
I'm fine.

598
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,880
I'm fine.

599
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,880
Why are you so relaxed?

600
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,880
Gu Yuwu is located in the Demon Citadel,

601
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,880
but it's very similar to the Demon Citadel.

602
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,880
When I first arrived,

603
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,880
I felt incredible.

604
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,880
It would be great

605
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,880
if I could live in such a comfortable place.

606
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,880
Yan.

607
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,880
If you like here,

608
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,880
I can stay with you forever.

609
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,880
Why?

610
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,880
Don't you like someone?

611
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,880
I never stopped looking for him.

612
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,880
And...

613
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,880
I'll find him soon.

614
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,880
Congratulations.

615
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,880
If you can find him

616
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,880
and bring him here,

617
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,880
it will be a good choice.

618
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,880
You'll understand soon.

619
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,880
Master.

620
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,880
I feel a little drunk.

621
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,880
Come on.

622
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,880
Go back and rest.

623
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,880
I've had enough.

624
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,880
I'll go back later.

625
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,880
OK.

626
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,880
Be careful.

627
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,880
Come on.

628
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,880
Be happy.

629
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,880
I think

630
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,880
Yan and Master

631
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,880
are a perfect match.

632
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,880
Besides,

633
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,880
Yan has obviously fallen in love with Master.

634
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,880
You can't tell, can you?

635
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,880
Fengqi.

636
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,880
I advise you

637
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,880
to be friends with Yan.

638
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,880
It's the best.

639
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,880
Really.

640
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,880
Who will win and who will lose?

641
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,880
It's not sure yet.

642
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,880
I'm so confused.

643
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,880
Hongluo.

644
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,880
Look over there.

645
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,880
The moon is beautiful tonight.

646
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,880
Would you like to

647
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,880
walk with me?

648
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,880
It's really a rare opportunity.

649
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,880
You really agreed?

650
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,880
Is the alcohol level low?

651
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,880
How did I get so drunk?

652
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,880
You...

653
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,880
Yan.

654
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,880
How are you?

655
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,880
I'm fine.

656
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,880
Maybe I'm a little drunk.

657
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,880
I'm not sober.

658
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,880
I'm just a little cold.

659
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,880
Yan.

660
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,880
Do you think it's familiar?

661
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,880
Guiyu Bay.

662
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,880
It's familiar.

663
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,880
Is it possible

664
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,880
that you really came here?

665
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,880
But you forgot.

666
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,880
If you don't remember,

667
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,880
I can help you.

668
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,880
Sorry, Fengqi.

669
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,880
I may be a little drunk and not sober.

670
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,880
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

671
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,880
I'll send you back.

672
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,880
No.

673
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,880
I'll walk around and be sober.

674
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,880
Are you happy?

675
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,880
Happy.

676
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,880
The dishes that Senior Brother and others cooked

677
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,880
and the meat that was grilled are all delicious.

678
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,880
Your hands are so warm.

679
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,880
I'm so happy.

680
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,880
I'm so happy.

681
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,880
I'm so happy.

682
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,880
I'm so happy.

683
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,880
I'm so happy.

684
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,880
I'm so happy.

685
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,880
I'm so happy.

686
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,880
Are you drunk?

687
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,880
No.

688
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,880
I didn't drink much.

689
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,880
Why do you always smile when you look at me?

690
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,880
Did you know that before?

691
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,880
Did I?

692
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,880
Yes.

693
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,880
Then it's yes.

694
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,880
You too.

695
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,880
Although many habits seem to have changed,

696
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,880
I still think

697
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,880
you

698
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,880
are still the original you.

699
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,880
I thought the 18 years of the Mo Yu experience

700
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,880
has made me completely change.

701
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,880
As long as the soul is not gone,

702
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,880
no.

703
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,880
Even if the soul is reborn,

704
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,880
I still have the confidence to recognize you.

705
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,880
If you can keep this confidence,

706
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,880
if you can keep this confidence,

707
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,880
I

708
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,880
I also have the confidence

709
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,880
to recognize you.

710
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,880
I also have the confidence to recognize you.

711
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,880
I also have the confidence to recognize you.

712
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,880
I also have the confidence to recognize you.

713
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,880
I also have the confidence to recognize you.

00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,880
I also have the confidence to recognize you.

715
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,880
I also have the confidence to recognize you.

716
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,880
I also have the confidence to recognize you.

717
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,880
I also have the confidence to recognize you.

718
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,880
I also have the confidence to recognize you.

719
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,880
I also have the confidence to recognize you.

720
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,880
I also have the confidence to recognize you.

721
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,880
I also have the confidence to recognize you.

722
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,880
I also have the confidence to recognize you.

723
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,880
I also have the confidence to recognize you.

724
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,880
I also have the confidence to recognize you.

725
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,880
I also have the confidence to recognize you.

726
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,880
I also have the confidence to recognize you.

727
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,880
I also have the confidence to recognize you.

728
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,880
I also have the confidence to recognize you.

729
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,880
I also have the confidence to recognize you.

730
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,880
I also have the confidence to recognize you.

731
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,880
I also have the confidence to recognize you.

732
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,880
I also have the confidence to recognize you.

733
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,880
I also have the confidence to recognize you.

734
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,880
I also have the confidence to recognize you.

735
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,880

00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,880
I also have the confidence to recognize you.

739
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,880
I also have the confidence to recognize you.

740
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,880
I also have the confidence to recognize you.

741
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,880
I also have the confidence to recognize you.
