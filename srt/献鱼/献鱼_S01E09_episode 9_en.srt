song title

3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,700
 ♫ Heavens strike with thunderous wrath ♫ 

4
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,420
 ♫ Mountains and rivers shatter before my eyes ♫ 

5
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,780
 ♫ Endless splendor
cultivated through lifetimes ♫ 

6
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,380
 ♫ Turns to dust between my fingers
in an instant ♫ 

7
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,180
 ♫ When the line
between good and evil is clear ♫ 

8
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,140
 ♫ Countless souls drift
into the boundless wilds ♫ 

9
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,660
 ♫ Carrying the spirit fire forward ♫ 

10
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:56,780
 ♫ I defy fate  ♫ Just to remain by your side ♫  

11
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,860
 ♫ Falling into love's abyss ♫ 

12
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,760
 ♫ Like heavy rain pouring down ♫ 

13
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,560
 ♫ Drunk on romance ♫ 

14
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,240
 ♫ In a blink, love and hate
vanish into illusion ♫ 

15
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,300
 ♫ Falling into endless love ♫ 

16
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,520
 ♫ Stirring waves upending a lifetime ♫ 

17
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,660
 ♫ Even if this life leads to ruin ♫ 

18
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:27,020
 ♫ I still choose to be entangled with you ♫ 

19
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,325
 ♫ Through all lifetimes ♫ 

20
00:01:30,325 --> 00:01:36,540
 

21
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,730
 

22
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,080
Go and report back.

23
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:45,340
Tell them I am unwell and will not attend the banquet at Serene Vale.

24
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,810
Understood.

25
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,520
Why aren't you going?

26
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,780
They want to use Ting Yan to seal Sima Jiao.

27
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,650
I must hurry and warn her.

28
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:09,830
We can't let such a good opportunity slip by.

29
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:13,420
I will do what you can't bear to do.

30
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,830
Once Liao Ting Yan is dead,

31
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:20,040
I will take her core and bring our people home.

32
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,900
Since the Grandmaster
has promised to protect me, I should be fine, right?

33
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,520
Is this a five-star hotel in the sky?
 

34
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,670
Oh my... If only I could stay there for a day.

35
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,400
I'd even pay!

36
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,860
Well, as long as I stick close
to the Grandmaster, I should be able to live for quite a while.

37
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,650
There must be plenty of treasures here waiting for me to enjoy.

38
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,640
Once Yuan Che gives the signal, we will act with the other palaces.

39
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,570
- Yes, Madam.
- Yes, Madam.

40
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,000
Someone is approaching.

41
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,880
They're finally here.

42
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,360
Why isn't the Grandmaster here?

43
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,520
Looks like he has figured out our plan.

44
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,840
If he had, would he have let her come?

45
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,920
 This celebratory feast is meant for you. 

46
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,520
 Its purpose is to kill you. Go 

47
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,680
 Take this and act as if everything is normal. 

48
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,350
This demon has broken our array!

49
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,560
Capture her!

50
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,420
Is there some misunderstanding? I'm not a demon.

51
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,310
You demon, surrender now!

52
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,520
Freeze!

53
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,860
Grandmaster!

54
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,680
Why have I suddenly become so powerful?

55
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,900
Were you helping me in secret?

56
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,720
- Let's go.
- Where to?

57
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,230
To die.

58
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,960
Young Madam, are we still going to wander
near White Deer Cliff?

59
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,320
The Grandmaster's been keeping a close eye
on all the palaces.

60
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,940
Madam Yue has repeatedly told you
to act with caution.

61
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,030
 If only Chu Hui had tried harder. 

62
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:16,660
 If she were the one
by the Grandmaster's side right now, everything would be much easier. 

63
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,830
That's why I must find a way
to run into the Grandmaster.

64
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:24,220
If I can win his favor, perhaps I can help Mother through this crisis.

65
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,250
But among the disciples
who entered the mountain,

66
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,820
only Liao Ting Yan has caught his eye.

67
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:35,760
Are you saying I can't even compare
to that useless three-spiritual-root?

68
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,240
Young Madam, spare me.

69
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,030
Young Madam,
don't trespass on White Deer Cliff!

70
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:51,940
I didn't do it. I can't control the pavilion at all!

71
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:56,520
This is strange.
Why did the pavilion suddenly stop?

72
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,080
Someone's coming.

73
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,730
It's...

74
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,600
Grandmaster.

75
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,110
Greetings, Grandmaster.

76
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,080
What a lovely flying pavilion.

77
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,710
The perfect place to kill someone.

78
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,150
Is the Grandmaster
planning to kill Liao Ting Yan here?

79
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:37,270
She should consider herself lucky
to be able to die in my flying pavilion.

80
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,590
Grandmaster, I'm willing to do it for you.

81
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,760
No need to get blood on your hands.

82
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,520
Are you from Moon Palace?

83
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,310
Yes. My mother is the Mistress of Moon Palace.

84
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:06,930
You're a guest here.

85
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,470
How could you throw the hostess out?
Isn't that rude?

86
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,690
The Eight Palaces and the Shi family

87
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:17,030
have taken much more than a flying pavilion from my clan.

88
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,450
You're leaving me here all by myself?

89
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,880
Isn't this the flying pavilion
I saw during the day?

90
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:54,710
Did I just check into a five-star hotel?

91
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,940
The view is amazing.

92
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,870
Did he put a bug on me or something?

93
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,460
How did he know I wanted to stay here?

94
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,350
Grandmaster.

95
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,350
You put together such a big setup,

96
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,770
yet you still couldn't defeat
a mere spy from the Demon Realm.

97
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:27,800
It seems the Eight Palaces
are due for new leaders.

98
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,960
Grandmaster, what do you mean by that?

99
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:36,040
Didn't you know Liao Ting Yan
was from the Demon Realm?

100
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:45,220
Then who exactly did you prepare all this for today?

101
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,080
We only just learned of it ourselves.

102
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,300
What do you intend to do
with Liao Ting Yan, Grandmaster?

103
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:02,140
Remove her tendons, peel off her skin, and break her bones.

104
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,490
I will imprison her first.

105
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,440
This place is wonderful.

106
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,700
I'd be happy to stay here for a month.

107
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,510
Then roast her flesh over fire.

108
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,370
A little more roasting and it'll be ready.

109
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,400
And throw her
into a freezing cold pool to soak.

110
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,560
Is this paradise?

111
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,000
Finally, she will be devoured by beasts,

112
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:51,050
never to see daylight again.

113
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,680
This really is a five-star hotel.

114
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,240
It's so comfortable.

115
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,140
And what about Liao Ting Yan's body?

116
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,510
There will be no body.

117
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:12,110
Under such torture, nothing will remain.

118
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,040
For a mere Demon Realm spy,

119
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,870
to die at the Grandmaster's hand
would be an honor.

120
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,490
Get lost.

121
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,230
Get lost!

122
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:54,180
Grandmaster, Liao Ting Yan may have committed grave crimes, but she is still my disciple.

123
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,480
I beg you, Grandmaster.

124
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,800
Let me bury her properly.

125
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,480
I already said there would be no body.

126
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,360
What are you going to bury?

127
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:17,610
Are you saying the Grandmaster
killed that woman from the Demon Realm himself?

128
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,230
Yes, that's what he said.

129
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,750
That's why we came to confirm.

130
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,560
Mother!

131
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,280
- Chu Hui?
- Mother, I finally found you.

132
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,350
Liao Ting Yan is finally dead.

133
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,730
Chu Hui, did you see something?

134
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,700
I took the Snow Goose Flying Pavilion near White Deer Cliff.

135
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,790
The Grandmaster suddenly
brought Liao Ting Yan there.

136
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,410
He then treated her with extreme cruelty.

137
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,340
He even said the flying pavilion
was perfect for killing someone.

138
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,670
 What a lovely flying pavilion. 

139
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,560
 The perfect place to kill someone. 

140
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,870
Liao Ting Yan was scared stiff.

141
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:57,010
I offered to do it for the Grandmaster, but it seemed he wanted to kill her himself.

142
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,230
So, it's true?

143
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,400
I thought Sima Jiao was just tricking us.

144
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,160
There's no point in guessing.

145
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,460
One look at the life lamp, and we'll know.

146
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,090
Sect Master!

147
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,190
Sect Master, Liao Ting Yan's life lamp suddenly went out.

148
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,300
We can't summon her soul either.

149
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,830
Looks like that demon really is dead.

150
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:23,860
Even her soul is gone?

151
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,960
What a pity.

152
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,990
Without Liao Ting Yan as bait, none of us can match the Grandmaster.

153
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:33,350
Of all times to die, she had to die now.

154
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:36,980
I say we end the meeting here for today and return to our palaces.

155
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,490
Hold on, everyone.

156
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:45,100
Sect Master Shi, do you still have doubts?

157
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,800
Everyone, you all saw with your own eyes

158
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,860
how the Grandmaster protected Liao Ting Yan

159
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,110
the day he broke the seals.

160
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:56,590
 How dare you act with such impudence before me? 

161
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,580
 What are you afraid of? 

162
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:01,280
 If I don't let you die, you won't die. 

163
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:05,250
He has been cruel since childhood,
without exception to anyone.

164
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:09,010
Just because he protected someone before doesn't mean he'll protect them now.

165
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:15,280
How about this?
To confirm the demon is truly gone,

166
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,640
I suggest you go to White Deer Cliff once more.

167
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,230
If she is not dead,

168
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:25,560
then right now,
she must think she has fooled us,

169
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,870
and her guard will be at its lowest.

170
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:33,180
If we search for her aura now, we will surely find something.

171
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,400
That is easy for you to say, Sect Master Shi.

172
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,400
Tell me, who in Gengchen Celestial Palace

173
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,210
would dare to trespass
on the Grandmaster's territory?

174
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:54,410
Then I suppose Sect Master Shi will have to do it himself.

175
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:00,440
I am willing to go to White Deer Cliff
to investigate, Sect Master Shi.

176
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,619
Good.

177
00:15:01,619 --> 00:15:06,250
Master Yuan, you must be very careful.

178
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,140
Don't worry, Sect Master.

179
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,990
 I must report this matter
to the Grandmaster at once. 

180
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,280
Wait, Master Yuan.

181
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,160
Master Yuan, I can't let you
take such a risk alone.

182
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:23,160
I will bring a few disciples and go with you to ensure nothing goes wrong.

183
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,530
Listen carefully.

184
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:26,010
Once you enter White Deer Cliff,

185
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,610
search immediately
for the Demon Realm spy's aura.

186
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,770
If you find her, capture her on the spot.

187
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,480
- Understood.
- Understood.

188
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,200
 ♫ Snow not gone, flame not out ♫ 

189
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,230
 ♫ Prism of three lifetimes ♫ 

190
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,470
 Tell me. 

191
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,530
 Why are you really here? 

192
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:08,090
 To fix my sleep schedule and unwind. 

193
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,870
 In short, to take a vacation. 

194
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,820
 - Don't you want to kill me?
- No. 

195
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,060
 Why not? 

196
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:16,480
 I am just an innocent nobody. 

197
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:22,470
 But I thought of a way that might cheer you up. 

198
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,920
 It worked! 

199
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,610
 I raised your realm, and you use it for this? 

200
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,160
 It's cheered you up, hasn't it? 

201
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,830
 Don't you like it? 

202
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:35,640
 ♫ Yet forget the reason why ♫ 

203
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,170
 ♫ Cycle back to raging flames ♫ 

204
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:42,210
 ♫ Even if my very soul were to vanish... ♫ 

205
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,990
 You see, this isn't my home. 

206
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,920
 It's not a place I'm familiar with. 

207
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,100
 And often, for no apparent reason, people always try to kill me. 

208
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,990
 Luckily, you're here. 

209
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:57,200
 That's why I can live like a carefree bum in such a harsh environment. 

210
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:04,760
 ♫ Mad love blooms a lotus in the heart ♫ 

211
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,840
Hurry.

212
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,930
The Demon Realm spy's aura is inside!

213
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,100
Grandmaster.

214
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,820
Grandmaster, this...

215
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,160
What is this?

216
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,110
How dare you trespass?

217
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:42,720
Do you also want to know what it's like to be wiped out without a trace?

218
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,650
Forgive us, Grandmaster.

219
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:49,550
I detected traces
of the Demon Realm spy's aura remaining

220
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:54,010
and was concerned for your safety, so I came to report it.

221
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:59,470
Since you like to busy yourself so much, come.

222
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,920
Clean this up.

223
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,970
Yes, Grandmaster.

224
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,590
 This is the only thing in the room that carries Liao Ting Yan's aura. 

225
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:22,230
 It seems she really has been killed. 

226
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:27,840
If you dare trespass again, you will no longer be the Sect Master.

227
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,510
Understood.

228
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,010
Let's go.

229
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,740
Cang Lan, you schemed against me?

230
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,720
What did you do?

231
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,270
What's wrong?

232
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,890
What happened?

233
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,700
We can never return to the Demon Realm now.

234
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,680
Sima Jiao killed Liao Ting Yan, leaving no trace of her body.

235
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,550
Her body, her core... Everything is gone.

236
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,550
What did you say?

237
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,780
Everyone heard it. Sima Jiao said it himself.

238
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,120
He only just realized Liao Ting Yan
was from the Demon Realm.

239
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,400
Then he killed her.

240
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,310
Even her life lamp has gone out.

241
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,410
 Sima Jiao has saved Ting Yan many times. 

242
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,410
 He's been with her constantly
since ending his seclusion. 

243
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,340
 Their bond could only have grown deeper. 

244
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,790
 Would he really have killed her in cold blood? 

245
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:48,030
Ru Ling, now that Liao Ting Yan is dead,

246
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,960
perhaps we should consider shifting the target to Sima Jiao.

247
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,940
Absolutely not.

248
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:56,540
To act recklessly under the Grandmaster's nose would only doom the entire Yin Palace.

249
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,700
What does Yin Palace have to do with you?

250
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,340
Have you grown so attached
to the palace mistress's seat

251
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,120
that you've forgotten Mother's dying wish

252
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,130
and the clansmen still waiting for you
to take them home?

253
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,920
How dare you!

254
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:12,840
Madam, the Black Serpent
that follows the Grandmaster is requesting an audience.

255
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,380
I will not see him.

256
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:23,020
Go and tell him that she will see him now.

257
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,730
Understood.

258
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,860
Father, Sima Jiao is cruel and bloodthirsty.

259
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,550
Liao Ting Yan was just
a passing amusement for him.

260
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:35,230
It is no surprise he killed her.

261
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,640
Why are you still worried?

262
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:42,260
Do you think Sima Jiao has already figured out that we plan to seal him?

263
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:46,150
If not, why didn't he
attend the banquet at Serene Vale?

264
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,200
If he no longer cared about Liao Ting Yan,

265
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,840
it makes sense that
he didn't accompany her there.

266
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,010
If he did know about our plan, he would have already gone berserk.

267
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:04,800
Until Sima Jiao is sealed,

268
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:09,690
I cannot feel at ease.

269
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,860
Any news from Chiyan City?

270
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,260
Nothing yet.

271
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,440
But rest assured, Father.

272
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,770
Everything is proceeding as planned.

273
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,270
Ru Ling.

274
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,670
Ru Ling.

275
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,640
No.

276
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,450
Greetings, Madam Ye.

277
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,550
You may leave us.

278
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,270
What happened to Ting Yan?

279
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,030
The Grandmaster didn't kill her, did he?

280
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,510
Let's sit and talk.

281
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,040
Come.

282
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,060
Ru Ling, I don't think Ting Yan is dead.

283
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,060
Really?

284
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,200
Then where is she now?

285
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,550
She...

286
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:02,470
Well, I don't really know where she is now.

287
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:05,720
But I think the Grandmaster must've found a way to keep her alive.

288
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,210
He simply doesn't want others
to know her whereabouts.

289
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:12,940
So, you are saying Ting Yan
is not with the Grandmaster now?

290
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:17,100
In that case, I can rest easier.

291
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,740
Still, as a man,
you should not come here so often.

292
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,920
People will talk.

293
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,550
What are you doing?

294
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:38,710
Madam Ye, please take me as your disciple.

295
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,740
This isn't a place for you to fool around.

296
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,740
- Get up.
- I am not fooling around.

297
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,610
Ru Ling, if I become your disciple,

298
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:50,230
I will have a reason to see you every day,

299
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:54,120
and you won't have to worry about gossip.

300
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,820
So, please,

301
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,140
take me as your disciple.

302
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:06,370
You inherited the Grandmaster's
spiritual power and techniques.

303
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:07,780
What could I possibly teach you?

304
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,680
How to be human.

305
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:13,480
And you think that is not fooling around?

306
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,880
I am serious.

307
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,820
As you know, I have only just taken human form.

308
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:23,670
There are still so many things about being human that I need to learn.

309
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:27,360
So, will you be my master?

310
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,110
Please?

311
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,790
Please?

312
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:38,410
If I had that much time, I would spend it on my own cultivation.

313
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:40,400
Why should I waste time teaching you?

314
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:46,260
Because if I learn well, I can become your capable aide,

315
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:49,710
and you can use me to get what you want.

316
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,640
What do you mean by that?

317
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,990
I remember, Ting Yan once said

318
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:01,470
you fought with everything you had
to become the palace mistress

319
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:05,000
because there was power you wanted to gain, things you wanted to accomplish,

320
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,030
and goals you wanted to achieve.

321
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,960
And I...

322
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,600
can help you with all of that.

323
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,400
 Ru Ling, he is Sima Jiao's guard. 

324
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,960
 You must make good use of this pawn. 

325
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,780
Trust me.

326
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:25,270
All right. Come with me.

327
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:28,780
I will tell you what I want to do.

328
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,680
Move it.

329
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,320
Get up!

330
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,670
Hurry!

331
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,880
They...

332
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,670
The people here are all captives taken from the Demon Realm

333
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:14,070
during the Immortal-Demon War years ago.

334
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:16,510
They have almost no access to spiritual veins

335
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:20,630
and have to rely on their scant memories of the Demon Race to cultivate.

336
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:26,250
So, they are the poorest in cultivation in the entire Yin Palace.

337
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,820
This...

338
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,270
is also where I grew up.

339
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:33,120
How could this happen?

340
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,470
They are already
people of the Celestial Palace.

341
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:39,810
They shouldn't be
abused like this in Yin Palace.

342
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:41,470
Soon, there will be no more abuse.

343
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:44,740
I have negotiated
with the elders for a long time

344
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,990
and finally brought them
to abolish their slave status.

345
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:53,000
So, today is their last day in the Labor Camp.

346
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,190
Ru Ling.

347
00:25:56,230 --> 00:26:01,200
You must have suffered so much in the past.

348
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,200
 Children, remember this. 

349
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,680
 No matter how difficult things
become in the future, 

350
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:15,290
 you must find a way to lead our people back to our homeland. 

351
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:21,880
But at least you have done
something great for your people.

352
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,600
But...

353
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:29,300
for most of them, if they can't return home in the Demon Realm,

354
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:33,680
then it doesn't matter where they live.

355
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,840
I brought you here to tell you

356
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:44,870
that letting my people live the life they want is my true wish.

357
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,490
I will help you.

358
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,750
Really?

359
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,440
I mean it.

360
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:02,540
You say you aren't used to being human
and don't understand humanity,

361
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:07,700
but in my eyes, you're actually more sincere than most people.

362
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:14,420
Really?

363
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:19,250
You're making me blush

364
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:23,070
with all that praise.

365
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,030
If you truly want to help me,

366
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:28,070
I should, of course,
give you something in return.

367
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,990
What do you mean?

368
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:32,400
I'm willing to be your master.

369
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,050
Master.

370
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,640
I bow to you, Master.

371
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,360
All right.

372
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,250
Since I am now your master,

373
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:45,680
I will give you a name.

374
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,840
Okay.

375
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,360
Since you are a black serpent,

376
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,310
and the day you took human form
was the 29th of the month,

377
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:55,990
I name you "Hei Nian Jiu". What do you think?

378
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:58,160
You actually remember the day I became human?

379
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,710
What's so hard about that?

380
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,620
Nian Jiu...

381
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,270
I like this name.

382
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:06,400
I'm glad you do.

383
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,480
 Grandmaster. 

384
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,250
 Why does he look so big? 

385
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:41,840
 Even his hand reaching toward me looks huge. 

386
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,490
 It's like he's a giant. 

387
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:58,000
 What is that? 

388
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:02,380
Why have I turned into an otter?

389
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,860
Why did you turn me into this?

390
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,500
Change me back!

391
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,340
I want my long legs and pretty face back!

392
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,230
I didn't turn you into this.

393
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:26,160
You wanted to become this yourself.

394
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,470
Nonsense.

395
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,970
You sly fox, full of lies!

396
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:31,260
I fed you a Form-Changing Pill,

397
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:35,420
and it turned you into the form
you remembered most vividly in your heart.

398
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,422
 

399
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,310
 This otter looks so sleek and shiny. 

400
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:49,160
 It must feel amazing to pet. 

401
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,440
 Why, oh why? 

402
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:55,330
 I can't feel this great fur myself, but instead, Sima Jiao gets to enjoy it. 

403
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:57,800
 The internet has ruined me... 

404
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,120
Change me back!

405
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,860
The Form-Changing Pill will keep you like this for three months.

406
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:07,200
Could you move your noble hand away?

407
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,270
I'm a person, not a body pillow, okay?

408
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:12,170
A body pillow?

409
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:14,880
Meaning a pillow to hold while you sleep?

410
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,030
That's a fine name.

411
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:19,400
Why did you feed me the Form-Changing Pill?

412
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:24,270
Because in the eyes of others, you are already dead.

413
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:28,110
Otherwise, sooner or later, you'd be killed by that traitor, Shi Qian Lv.

414
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:31,040
Isn't he your guardian?

415
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:36,230
The respect he shows now is just an act.

416
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:38,710
So, you did this for my sake?

417
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:42,820
But turning me into an otter is going too far.

418
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,920
I think it's "schoolkid-ish."

419
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:48,690
That's not how you use that word.

420
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,200
Never mind.

421
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:59,300
If sleeping could raise your realm, you'd be dominating Gengchen Celestial Palace.

422
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,880
 Where did this spirit pet come from? 

423
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,650
 The Grandmaster is so friendly with it. 

424
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,740
Grandmaster, I have a new name now.

425
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,730
It's Hei Nian Jiu.

426
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:20,610
Nice name!

427
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:22,920
Congrats, Nian Jiu!

428
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,200
What are you squealing about, you little thing?

429
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,340
What's it to you?

430
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:30,500
Even with a new name,
he's still the same dumb snake.

431
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,200
Grandmaster, you value Ting Yan greatly.

432
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,610
Surely you didn't really kill her, right?

433
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:39,820
I haven't even told her my new name yet.

434
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:44,280
If you don't find out
what I told you to investigate soon, I will kill you, too.

435
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,990
Spare me, Grandmaster.

436
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:48,500
I've already found that girl.

437
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,710
She's An Xue from Yin Palace.

438
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,750
I asked Ru Ling about her.

439
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:56,710
She said she hadn't seen An Xue for days.

440
00:31:56,710 --> 00:32:01,800
But her life lamp is still lit, so she should still be alive
and just hidden somewhere.

441
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:07,660
By the way, I've brought many things An Xue left in Yin Palace.

442
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:10,760
Maybe some of them could be useful.

443
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,820
Neither erasing her memory
nor killing her outright...

444
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,100
That's not Shi Qian Lv's style.

445
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:27,050
What's so special about this An Xue that he'd go to so much trouble?

446
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:29,820
Could it be that Shi Qian Lv
has taken a liking to An Xue and has ulterior motives toward her?

447
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,540
You actually guessed it.

448
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:46,000
That shameless old fool.

449
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:52,250
You fool, this is something
Shi Zhen Xu has touched.

450
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:57,060
So, it was Shi Zhen Xu who hid An Xue away?

451
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,580
He's the one she's involved with?

452
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:13,200
Inject this strand of spiritual power
into An Xue's life lamp

453
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,660
and spread the word
that we are looking for her.

454
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,410
Understood.

455
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:22,150
Who knows?

456
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,590
Perhaps Shi Zhen Xu
is Shi Qian Lv's weak point.

457
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,743
 

458
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,410
We did it!

459
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:36,210
The new Spirit Fire has taken shape!

460
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:37,880
Congratulations, Father.

461
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,160
Now that the Spirit Fire is ready, we're one step closer to completing our plan.

462
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,640
We've reached a key turning point.

463
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,960
Hurry to Chiyan City.

464
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,030
Get them to speed things up.

465
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:48,580
Rest assured, Father. I will not let you down.

466
00:33:50,812 --> 00:33:52,706
 

467
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:58,580
Sima Jiao, your days are numbered.

468
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:06,400
Stay here for now.

469
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,670
Once Father's plan is fulfilled, we will be together forever.

470
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,620
I'll wait for you to come back.

471
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:16,660
Goodbye.

472
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,140
Sect Master.

473
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:45,050
Do you know Sima Jiao
is searching for you everywhere?

474
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,610
Zhen Xu...

475
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:54,720
hasn't performed
Soul Cleanse on you yet, has he?

476
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,340
I will be extra careful in the coming days.

477
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,840
I won't let Sima Jiao find me.

478
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,010
Good.

479
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:14,510
Go now.

480
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,380
Thank you, Sect Master.

481
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:34,120
Only the dead

482
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:37,510
can never be found.

483
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:50,190
Grandmaster, An Xue's life lamp went out.

484
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,590
Shi Qian Lv killed her.

485
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:56,030
Looks like we won't be able
to get any information from her.

486
00:35:56,030 --> 00:36:00,750
If I want it, even the dead can come back to life.

487
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,830
Grandmaster.

488
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:18,710
Still going to protect the one who killed you?

489
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:23,440
I only wished to be with Zhen Xu forever.

490
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,860
Why did he kill me?

491
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:30,410
I will tell you whatever
you want to know, Grandmaster.

492
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:34,220
Please avenge me and kill Shi Qian Lv.

493
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:39,030
What exactly is Shi Qian Lv plotting
with Shi Zhen Xu?

494
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,380
I... I don't know.

495
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,360
Where did Shi Zhen Xu go?

496
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,070
Chiyan City.

497
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:52,640
To find someone
with a flame-shaped birthmark on their back.

498
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:59,450
Why is he looking for such a birthmark?

499
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:08,800
Grandmaster, is she truly gone just like that?

500
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,030
Her soul was completely destroyed.

501
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:15,020
Even my spell could only keep her here for a short while.

502
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:17,820
Shi Qian Lv is so ruthless.

503
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:21,060
Now, I finally understand what you meant when you said

504
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:26,490
Shi Zhen Xu was Shi Qian Lv's weak point.

505
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,510
Let's hear it.

506
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:35,590
You already knew Shi Qian Lv was unhappy about Shi Zhen Xu being involved with An Xue,

507
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:38,220
so you had me spread the word that we were looking for her,

508
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:42,640
knowing his dissatisfaction and resentment would drive him to kill her.

509
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,800
When you had me inject your spiritual power into An Xue's life lamp,

510
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,970
it was all in preparation for this day.

511
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:51,180
You're finally making some progress.

512
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,330
Grandmaster, this is Ting Yan's bed.

513
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:10,960
Nian Jiu, why do you look like
you just lost a dear friend?

514
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,970
Grandmaster, you didn't really
kill Ting Yan, did you?

515
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:19,550
Grandmaster, hurry and tell him the truth.

516
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:24,390
If I didn't kill her, others would have.

517
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:26,680
Death was inevitable for her.

518
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:28,840
Better to end her suffering early.

519
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,720
I don't believe it.
You would never kill Ting Yan.

520
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,720
You must have hidden her away
to protect her, right?

521
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:43,120
 I can't let this thing take the Grandmaster's attention away. 

522
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,210
 I have to do something. 

523
00:38:57,370 --> 00:39:01,590
How am I supposed to eat, drink,
and have fun like this?

524
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:05,510
We will go on vacation somewhere else.

525
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,720
Where?

526
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,050
Somewhere more fun than the flying pavilion?

527
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:11,900
Yes. You'll see.

528
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:15,030
 Even though you turned me
into an animal and keep petting me, 

529
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:18,030
 you did it to protect me. 

530
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:21,530
 Sima Jiao, I guess
you're not completely heartless after all. 

531
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:35,530
What's wrong with these puppet servants?

532
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:36,780
Are they broken?

533
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:41,850
These puppet servants are all eyes for that old fool, Shi Qian Lv.

534
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:43,720
You said it so calmly.

535
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,380
You knew from the start, didn't you?

536
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:50,110
If I hadn't left him a few flaws to find,

537
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:53,090
how else would he have lowered his guard?

538
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,780
How long will we be gone?

539
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:58,070
Will people find out?

540
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:02,400
I doubt they would dare to trespass on White Deer Cliff again.

541
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:05,490
 Grandmaster, I'm dull-witted. 

542
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:08,450
 I don't know how to have fun
the way Ting Yan did. 

543
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:10,740
 Don't mention that dead woman again. 

544
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,340
 Have you found who spread the news
about Liao Ting Yan? 

545
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,870
 Yes. 

546
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,880
 It was An Xue from Three Saints Mountain. 

547
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,700
 She held a grudge against Ting Yan, 

548
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:25,450
 so she must have spread the news
to take revenge. 

549
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:29,810
 But she's already dead, so I couldn't get anything out of her. 

550
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:31,670
Sima Jiao.

551
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:35,420
Let's see how much longer
you can act so arrogantly.

552
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:38,400
 

553
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:47,040
Is Chiyan City the outer perimeter
of Gengchen Celestial Palace you mentioned before?

554
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,090
That's right.

555
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:52,560
The inner area is where
the main branches of the great clans reside.

556
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,740
It is rich in spiritual energy
and ideal for cultivation.

557
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:59,400
The outer perimeter is a gathering place for smaller affiliated families,

558
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,340
mostly the families of the sect's disciples, who have lived here for generations.

559
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,400
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

560
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,480
There are also common people who moved here for protection.

561
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,574
So, here... everyone's at a low realm.

562
00:41:12,574 --> 00:41:14,950
- I see.
- Wonderful!

563
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,570
Nice!

564
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,900
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

565
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,560
Again!

566
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,760
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

567
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:38,030
You have good taste, sir.

568
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,660
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

569
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:49,310
It's been so long since I last saw
this kind of liveliness.

570
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:52,800
Did you live in a place like this before?

571
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,870
Sort of. It feels a bit familiar.

572
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,300
We have business to attend to here.

573
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:01,410
If you like, you can eat
to your heart's content here.

574
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:03,180
- Great!
- All right.

575
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,660
I was talking to the otter.

576
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,680
Grandmaster is so nice to that newcomer.

577
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:28,530
 Why did something inside me just stir? 

578
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:31,450
 What is it trying to tell me? 

579
00:42:50,040 --> 00:43:00,080


580
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:05,070
