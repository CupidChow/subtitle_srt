00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The world is broken in front of me

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The world is broken in front of me

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The world is broken in front of me

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The world is broken in front of me

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The world is broken in front of me

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The world is broken in front of me

The world is broken in front of me

The world is broken in front of me

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The world is broken in front of me

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The world is broken in front of me

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The world is broken in front of me

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The world is broken in front of me

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The world is broken in front of me

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The world is broken in front of me

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The world is broken in front of me

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The world is broken in front of me

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The world is broken in front of me

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The world is broken in front of me

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The world is broken in front of me

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The world is broken in front of me

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The world is broken in front of me

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The world is broken in front of me

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The world is broken in front of me

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The world is broken in front of me

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The world is broken in front of me

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The world is broken in front of me

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The world is broken in front of me

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The world is broken in front of me

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The world is broken in front of me

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The Long Ballad

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Episode 15

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I asked you to find someone, not to rob.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Your Majesty,

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
this lady came willingly.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
She came willingly

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and cried like her husband died.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Your Majesty,

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
this lady knows your identity.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The Long Ballad

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What's your name?

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Liao Tingyan.

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Liao Tingyan

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Liao Tingyan

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Why did she enter my dream

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
and make me feel relieved?

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Why did she appear here

48
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
so coincidentally?

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What she did was strange.

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I can't be careless

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
because of that dream.

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Why are you crying?

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I can't drink wine without drinking.

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
We met each other.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You know me?

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Of course I know you.

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
We met before.

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
This is our first meeting.

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
This is...

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Why did you appear in front of me?

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
To see you.

62
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You look the same.

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
But your eyes are so clear,

64
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:22,860
your

65
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
eyes

66
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What are you talking about?

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Do you know who I am?

68
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You are Sima Jiao,

69
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
the little emperor who protects the country.

70
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Have you ever heard that

71
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I kill people like horses?

72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I once

73
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
skinned a person who was

74
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
a big mouth to me.

75
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I hung him at the gate of the palace

76
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
until he was blown away by the wind

77
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
and turned into a white bone.

78
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Did you ever want to kill someone's family?

79
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You just blew up half of the Gengchen's mansion

80
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and burned half of the demon's jade

81
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
to make a flower fertilizer.

82
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I am not a person who likes to think about the future.

83
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I am not a person who likes to think about the future.

84
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What are you laughing at?

85
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Why do I look so cute when I laugh at you?

86
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I finally met you.

87
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You are He Yuanyuan.

88
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You are king of the Lincoln's residence.

89
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
My Orchid's Leg.

90
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Where is the從nil?

91
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
How beautiful the beautiful eyesight,

92
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm still the same as before.

93
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
But I look so different.

94
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Now I have some blood on my face.

95
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Not as pale as before.

96
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I think you'll be a mortal in this life.

97
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You'll be a good person.

98
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You'll be comforted a lot.

99
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm dying.

100
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
God wants to kill me.

101
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
But I don't want to give him this life.

102
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
If you don't have those memories,

103
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
shouldn't you be so free?

104
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Your Majesty.

105
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The man who saved Wei Xianyu was found.

106
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's him.

107
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
He's the one who saved Wei Xianyu.

108
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
He's the one who saved Wei Xianyu.

109
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
He's the one who saved Wei Xianyu.

110
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Did you find out his identity?

111
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
No clue yet.

112
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I fell asleep last night.

113
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Did he do it too?

114
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
If he's really the man who saved me,

115
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
then in my dream,

116
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
it's a conspiracy.

117
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Prepare yourself.

118
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm taking him back to the palace.

119
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Well...

120
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I haven't found out his identity.

121
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm afraid it's not appropriate for Your Majesty

122
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
to take him back to the palace.

123
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You're not a mortal.

124
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
With our current people,

125
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm afraid we can't do anything about him.

126
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I just don't want to wake him up.

127
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Since he's trying to get close to me,

128
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'll just follow his order

129
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
and take him back to the palace.

130
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
His Majesty is usually so considerate.

131
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
He's explained a lot now.

132
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'll go prepare now.

133
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Wei...

134
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
The food at the banquet is so delicious.

135
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
What?

136
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You want to say you're not a mortal?

137
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You can think of me as a fairy.

138
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You think

139
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
you can seduce me

140
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
with this kind of words?

141
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's normal that you don't believe it

142
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
with your current level.

143
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
But there's something I'm curious about.

144
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
What is it?

145
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
How can I seduce you

146
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
so that you can hook me?

147
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
How dare you!

148
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I know.

149
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
According to your personality,

150
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
you must suspect that I'm planning something.

151
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
But you don't have the truth now.

152
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I just have to let you believe me.

153
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Okay.

154
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
From now on,

155
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
you're Madam Gu's wife.

156
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You're so young.

157
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You can't be angry

158
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
when I see your face when you talk like this.

159
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's not the time yet.

160
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You're so hot.

161
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
After being hurt by a selfish bastard,

162
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I became a hot-tempered person.

163
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Who is that bastard?

164
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I said you would avenge me.

165
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I can consider it.

166
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I can consider it.

167
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
He's amazing.

168
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You can't afford to make trouble.

169
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
He's even more amazing than me.

170
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Let's compete with each other.

171
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
There's a big road to Yancheng.

172
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Why are you going to the forest?

173
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Aren't you afraid of bandits?

174
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
With you,

175
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm afraid of bandits.

176
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I don't know martial arts.

177
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Didn't you say you were a fairy?

178
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Fairies are not all-round.

179
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Otherwise,

180
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I have a way to deal with you.

181
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Don't be so cruel.

182
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I didn't do it.

183
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It has nothing to do with you.

184
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I was too careless.

185
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Turn around.

186
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
My master is a doctor.

187
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'll just rub it for you.

188
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Come on.

189
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
No need.

190
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I can't even cure my depression.

191
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Turn around.

192
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Why is my heart beating so fast?

193
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Did I get seduced by him like this?

194
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
No.

195
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
He must have used a demon's power.

196
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm worried about him.

197
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Relax.

198
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Don't think about anything else.

199
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I can't sleep.

200
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Even if he lives,

201
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
his spirit was still damaged in the past.

202
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And now,

203
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
his body is not very well integrated.

204
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
That's why I always feel headache.

205
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Why don't you go anywhere

206
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
and make yourself feel so uncomfortable?

207
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Although this is just a simple pill in the Qinggu Heaven,

208
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
it's already useful for the mortal body.

209
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Does it have any use?

210
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I don't understand.

211
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You little brat.

212
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You don't know how to speak Chinese at all.

213
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Go to sleep.

214
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Go to sleep.

215
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
There's an assassin.

216
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Protect the family.

217
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You're here.

218
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You're right.

219
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You left the forest to attract the assassin.

220
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Good martial arts.

221
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
If I don't rely on martial arts,

222
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
but rely on the whole family,

223
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I really can't beat him.

224
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
So this ancestor has been eating firewood for half a week.

225
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'm afraid he'll be in danger.

226
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'll go to the forest to find him.

227
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
This Si Ma Jiao came to the mortal world

228
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
to be the emperor of the country.

229
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I guess he's trying to stop me from opening the Nine-oil Lotus Robe.

230
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
To release my evil soldiers and evil soldiers.

231
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Hurry.

232
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Be careful.

233
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Liao Ting Yan moves fast.

234
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
He's actually meeting Si Ma Jiao in the mortal world.

235
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
He's the only one protecting Si Ma Jiao.

236
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
This is a tricky problem.

237
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I almost forgot.

238
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Be careful with the calligraphy.

239
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Follow the direction of the mortal.

240
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Liu Huo Gou.

241
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
You're still trying to hurt me with the calligraphy of the mortal world?

242
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
How are you?

243
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Imperial physician.

244
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I'm here.

245
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Madam Yan is so badly injured.

246
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Why do you look...

247
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It hurts.

248
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Your blood...

249
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Why is it stopped?

250
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I...

251
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I...

252
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I just saw you being shot by the assassin.

253
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Blood is like a pillar.

254
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Why is it so hard?

255
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
The wound is healed.

256
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's not a big deal.

257
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's just a small wound.

258
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It's not a big deal.

259
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
The wound is healed.

260
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Your Majesty, you must have misjudged it.

261
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I was just hurt by the calligraphy.

262
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It looks scary.

263
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
But it's not a big deal.

264
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I'll go clean Madam Yan's wound.

265
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
If she's from the South Marquis,

266
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
she must be eager to kill the enemy.

267
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
But she saved her just now.

268
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It seems she's not from the South Marquis.

269
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Then why did the witch come to me?

270
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
She just used some spiritual power.

271
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Such a useless body.

272
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Si Ma Jiao.

273
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
If it weren't for you,

274
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
why would I use other people's blood

275
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
to maintain the martial arts?

276
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I'll revenge you

277
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
for your hatred.

278
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
My Lord.

279
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Wei Xianyu's men

280
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
were assassinated on the way back to the city.

281
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
His Majesty has arrested them.

282
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Where's Wei Xianyu?

283
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
His Majesty also captured him.

284
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
He has done a lot of things

285
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
for me these years.

286
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I can't keep him anymore.

287
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Thank you for your hard work.

288
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's a secret.

289
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I'm worried about

290
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
if others know about it.

291
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You're welcome.

292
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Si Ma Jiao has noticed it.

293
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
You must be careful.

294
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Who are you?

295
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Marquis has been holding his heart for a long time.

296
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
He doesn't want to end it quickly.

297
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
He wants to kill you.

298
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'm here.

299
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm here.

300
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm here.

301
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm here.

302
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm here.

303
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm here.

304
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I'm here.

305
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm here.

306
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm here.

307
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm here.

308
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm here.

309
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Si Ma Jiao.

310
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Tell me.

311
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Who are you?

312
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm here to make a vow with you.

313
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Please be reasonable.

314
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Please let go.

315
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Let go.

316
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Gao Ran, why are you here?

317
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I know about your plan.

318
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I can help you to take over the country.

319
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Why do you help me?

320
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Do you know what's in this mountain?

321
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I only know that all the kings of the tiger kingdom will be here.

322
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
This mountain was called Feng mountain thousands of years ago.

323
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I need it in this mountain.

324
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
After the ceremony of the defeat of the king of the tiger kingdom,

325
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I can have the jade seal that will open the country.

326
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
That's why I came to ask for your help.

327
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Then, why don't you just put it on that little emperor?

328
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Then you can achieve your own goal.

329
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Because Sima Jiao and the marquis have the aura of a dragon.

330
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
You mean I have the aura of a dragon?

331
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
The aura of a dragon is hard to be broken by the father of heaven and the descendants of the royal family.

332
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Only those who have the aura of a dragon are qualified to ascend the throne.

333
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Sima Jiao is useless and unworthy of the title.

334
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
So I'm willing to help you ascend the throne under the order of the marquis.

335
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I'm a great man.

336
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I don't know if I'm normal or not.

337
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
But the death of Sima Jiao is coming.

338
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
If he dies like this,

339
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
then even if I become the emperor,

340
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I will be criticized.

341
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,000
That's it.

342
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I will act in your way.

343
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I will help you to fight against the evil and fight against the evil.

344
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
But if you act in the way of the world,

345
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I'm afraid that everything will be lost.

346
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:03,140
Chonginda

347
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,340
I look forward to looking forward to it.

348
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,580
Thank you, Your Majesty.

349
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:19,940
Enough.

350
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,820
When you play a so-class squeeze pose,

351
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,980
you can go with me as if we are one.

352
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:26,900
Endless p failure.

353
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,840
Steve.

354
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,400
Your Majesty,

355
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,640
Wei Xianyu was taken hostage by Yan Chen.

356
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,880
As for Madam Yan,

357
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,960
the assassin didn't know her.

358
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,000
In Liying before she died,

359
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:58,280
she never met an

360
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,360
that case.

361
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,760
Your Ladyship

362
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,560
is also suspicious.

363
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,480
She's not from the local region of Liyang,

364
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,360
nor is she from the outside.

365
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,000
She seems to have appeared out of thin air.

366
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,360
She's not a mortal,

367
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:16,960
but

368
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,800
if she's not from the South Marquis,

369
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,880
why would she appear by my side?

370
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,240
What else does she want to do?

371
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,360
What Gao Ren means is

372
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,440
that Sima Jiao

373
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,040
also has Gao Ren.

374
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,240
The Lady Yan who brought Sima Jiao back from Liyang

375
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,680
is a low-skilled witch.

376
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,200
Is that true?

377
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,760
If you don't believe me,

378
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,600
let the spies in the palace

379
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,000
investigate it.

380
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,840
Your Ladyship,

381
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,120
His Majesty ordered that there will be a banquet tonight.

382
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,480
Please prepare a meal and go to the banquet.

383
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,280
Okay.

384
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:08,960
By the way,

385
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,240
Eunuch,

386
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,200
how are the people who are trying to kill His Majesty

387
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,000
on the way?

388
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,160
That's dangerous,

389
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,240
especially the guards.

390
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,960
They've all been put into the prison to interrogate.

391
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,320
Please don't worry.

392
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,080
What can we interrogate?

393
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,360
It's hard to get someone behind her.

394
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,640
This...

395
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,720
This...

396
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,280
There are others behind her

397
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,400
who want to harm His Majesty.

398
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,520
Isn't His Majesty in danger?

399
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,320
I don't know.

400
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,320
Please don't make it hard for me.

401
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,000
Now that Sima Jiao has lost her memories,

402
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,920
she's been very careful.

403
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,560
If I help her deal with the spies behind her,

404
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,480
I can protect her

405
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
and get rid of her doubts about me.

406
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,320
Your Ladyship,

407
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,520
don't worry about these annoying things.

408
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,760
Please have a good rest.

409
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,760
His Majesty is worried about your injury.

410
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,320
He asked the imperial physician to treat you again.

411
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,240
No need.

412
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,400
I'm fine.

413
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,760
Don't push yourself too hard.

414
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,160
It's better to be careful when you're sick.

415
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,680
Imperial physician Yi.

416
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,560
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

417
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,400
Imperial physician Yi,

418
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,960
how is my wife's injury?

419
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,320
Her wound is fine now.

420
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,240
When I saw her being stabbed,

421
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,440
her blood flowed like a pillar.

422
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,920
Now it seems that

423
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,160
her injury is not serious.

424
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,240
She was just hurt by a small scratch.

425
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,240
His Majesty is too petty.

426
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,360
It means that His Majesty cares about her.

427
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,080
And she just entered the palace today.

428
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,240
His Majesty asked her to join the banquet.

429
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,040
Other ladies don't treat her like this.

430
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,440
It's not like that.

431
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,040
I'm worried about her.

432
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,640
Other ladies don't treat her like this.

433
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,040
Other ladies?

434
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,840
Don't forget about it.

435
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,840
It's good that you're healthy.

436
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,960
Now you just need to take the tonic

437
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,240
to nourish your blood.

438
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,000
Thank you, Imperial physician Yi.

439
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,640
The beautiful scenery.

440
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,000
Does His Majesty have many ladies?

441
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,160
Your Ladyship only has

442
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,200
you and the daughter of Marquis Nan Yan,

443
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,200
Lady Sixian.

444
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,920
The rest are all beautiful ladies.

445
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,880
The rest?

446
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,720
How many are there?

447
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,480
Your Ladyship, don't worry about it.

448
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,360
His Majesty brought you back.

449
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,520
Those beautiful ladies

450
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,840
are just all-rounders.

451
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,840
They're all in the palace.

452
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
They're not as beautiful as you.

453
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,520
So what?

454
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,680
She just entered the palace.

455
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,280
When I think of her,

456
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,000
I have to help her.

457
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,600
I can only bear to be jealous.

458
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,720
Your Majesty,

459
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,040
according to your order,

460
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,840
I've sent the imperial physician to check her.

461
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,240
Lady Yan's wound has indeed healed.

462
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,440
Your Majesty,

463
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,440
are you really going to

464
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,320
leave such a wicked person

465
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,320
by your side?

466
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,000
You said she had a heart.

467
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,400
Speaking of a heart,

468
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,000
yesterday, Marquis Nan Yan was in Chengming Hall.

469
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,880
He was taken to Tianming Hall.

470
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,840
Is that true?

471
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,080
Marquis Nan Yan was so hurt.

472
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,000
Why did His Majesty get angry?

473
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,360
Hmm.

474
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,800
Today's banquet

475
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,240
is more interesting.

476
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,120
Do you really think so?

477
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,520
Yes.

478
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,840
Lady Yan

479
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,920
was obviously injured by the guards.

480
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,240
But in less than a day,

481
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,360
all the wounds on her body were healed.

482
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,480
I heard that

483
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,000
Lady Yan was looking for

484
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,400
Sima Jiao that day.

485
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,480
There was a strange sound.

486
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,760
The demon was so strong.

487
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,440
Is that true?

488
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,880
Yes.

489
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,480
Lady Yan

490
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,560
is really a demon.

491
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,640
Marquis, there's one more thing.

492
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,200
His Majesty asked Lady Yan

493
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,840
to attend the banquet tonight.

494
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,800
I think

495
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,560
His Majesty is very fond of her.

496
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:05,960
Hmm.

497
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,040
Keep an eye on the palace.

498
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,280
If anything changes,

499
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,880
report to me at any time.

500
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,280
Yes.

501
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,480
Marquis, do you believe

502
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,120
that Liao Ting Yan is a demon?

503
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,200
I didn't expect

504
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,480
such a demon

505
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,040
to be in Sima Jiao.

506
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,320
Then

507
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,680
my daughter, Lady Siyan,

508
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,080
will be in danger.

509
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,720
So the priority

510
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,040
is to get Lady Yan

511
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,280
who is protecting Sima Jiao

512
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,240
out of here as soon as possible

513
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,280
to avoid ruining our plan.

514
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,760
Then tonight's banquet

515
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,160
will be held in the palace.

516
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:39,880
Yes.

517
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,520
Yes.

518
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,120
Yes.

519
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:41,760
Yes.

520
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,280
Yes.

521
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:42,880
Yes.

522
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,800
The banquet

523
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,400
is a good opportunity for me.

524
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,480
If I can get rid of Wei Xian Yu

525
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,800
and that demon,

526
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,640
I will definitely

527
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,880
work with you.

528
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,040
You'll be cortex attack that person later

529
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,440
because she is too much!

530
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,440
Lady Siyan...

531
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,360
S ini yang exerc secondary choice ofak and分享

532
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,360
Please enjoy your meal.

533
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,640
Thank you, Your Majesty.

534
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,520
Thank you, Your Majesty.

535
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,440
Enjoy yourself.

536
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,880
Thank you, Your Majesty, for taking care of me.

537
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:35,520
I just enjoy that World's gate food a little.

538
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,080
This flirt?

539
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,740
Sister Siyan.

540
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:01,040
Siyan, why do you not visit once and check on her performance?

541
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,080
Lingnan has a beautiful scenery.

542
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,080
You can go there if you want.

543
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,080
You can stay there for three years.

544
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,080
You're trying to make me suffer.

545
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,920
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

546
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,920
Your Majesty, I will never

547
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,920
open Chengming Hall again.

548
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,920
I will let the people in there.

549
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,920
What are you talking about?

550
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,120
Even if Duke Nan Yan and Lady Sixian

551
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,120
are not sick today,

552
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,520
you can't say that

553
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,520
they are just people behind their backs.

554
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,520
I didn't mean that.

555
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,520
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

556
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,520
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

557
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,320
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

558
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,320
The Empress Dowager is here.

559
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,520
Greetings, Your Highness.

560
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,920
How old are you?

561
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,320
Do you still have to be so childish?

562
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,320
Si Ma Shi has already died.

563
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,320
He can't stay alive.

564
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,320
I'm afraid that he's just a dead body.

565
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,320
This is a compensation for the past life.

566
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,320
Si Ma will not have any regrets about mother's death.

567
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,920
This is Lady Yan, right?

568
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,920
Why are you staring at me like that?

569
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,920
Yes.

570
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,920
I saw that the Empress Dowager is very graceful and elegant.

571
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,920
She has a very unique aura.

572
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,920
She looks like the Goddess of the Temple in my hometown.

573
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,920
I'm sorry.

574
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,920
You're so sweet.

575
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,920
No wonder His Majesty likes you.

576
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,920
I want to know

577
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,920
where the Goddess of the Temple is.

578
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,920
I really want to see her.

579
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,920
Everyone, please enter the banquet.

580
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,920
Thank you, Your Highness.

581
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,920
I still don't know

582
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,920
where your hometown is.

583
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,920
My hometown is in the capital.

584
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,920
Then why did you go to Liyang?

585
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,920
Your Highness, the Empress Dowager is asking.

586
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,920
You can't not answer.

587
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,920
I grew up with my mother.

588
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,920
Last year, the world was in a drought.

589
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,920
Mother was in a hurry.

590
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,920
She died without knowing.

591
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,920
So I had to take my sister from the Lin family

592
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,920
to fight for life.

593
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,920
Finally, I arrived in Liyang and settled down.

594
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,920
It turned out to be like this.

595
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,920
What a poor girl.

596
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,920
Now that you are in the palace,

597
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,920
you will not suffer

598
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,920
as long as you serve His Majesty.

599
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,920
Yes.

600
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,920
Your Majesty, it's so beautiful.

601
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,920
Please let me give you a toast.

602
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,920
Let's drink.

603
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,920
As expected,

604
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,920
Kong Dou can't avoid the poison.

605
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,920
Now the poisonous wine is out of alcohol.

606
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,920
Si Ma Qiao,

607
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,920
with a magical baby like me,

608
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,920
you can just enjoy it.

609
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,920
Magic?

610
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,920
Si Ma Qiao!

611
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,920
Shi You Yan.

612
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,920
Take him away.

613
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,920
Yes.

614
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,920
This...

615
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,920
This is the Empress Dowager.

616
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,920
The Empress Dowager is dead.

617
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,920
She suddenly died.

618
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,920
Are you busy?

619
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,920
I'm not.

620
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,920
I'm not.

621
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,920
I'm not.

622
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,920
Your Majesty,

623
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,920
this is your favorite Fulin chicken soup.

624
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,920
The Empress Dowager cooked it herself

625
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,920
for several hours.

626
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,920
You can all leave.

627
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,920
Yes.

628
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,920
Thank you, Mother.

629
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,920
I'm sorry

630
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,920
to have scared you.

631
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,920
It's not your fault.

632
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,920
I saw you at the banquet today.

633
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,920
You didn't even move your chopsticks.

634
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,920
I didn't know

635
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,920
you were so good at cooking.

636
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,920
I'm sorry.

637
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,920
But that Madam Yan

638
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,920
has a good appetite.

639
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,920
As long as she has a good appetite,

640
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,920
I've never seen her unhappy.

641
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,920
I have no other business.

642
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,920
I've been in the past.

643
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,920
I have a limited amount of sorrow.

644
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,920
You have great wisdom.

645
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,920
I'm surprised.

646
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,920
I once put someone in your arms

647
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,920
and couldn't put anyone in it.

648
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,920
Now you've taken the initiative

649
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,920
to bring a girl back to the palace.

650
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,920
Today,

651
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,920
you're a good person.

652
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,920
She's different from others.

653
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,920
If you really like her,

654
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,920
why don't you just ignore her?

655
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,920
Why don't you just ignore her?

656
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,920
I don't like her.

657
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,920
You're my son.

658
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,920
You and her little mind,

659
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,920
can't you see it?

660
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,920
Mother.

661
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,920
According to the ancestral system,

662
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,920
before you go to the Mount Baishan,

663
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,920
you must be a empress.

664
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,920
You must be quick

665
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,920
to make the empress.

666
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,920
Don't worry.

667
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,920
Mother saw her doing things today.

668
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,920
She will help you settle down in the harem.

669
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,920
What?

670
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,920
You're worried about her?

671
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,920
I once suspected

672
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,920
she was a member of the Nanyan Duke.

673
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,920
But she risked her life to save her.

674
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,920
She should have nothing to do with the Nanyan Duke.

675
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,920
But she

676
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,920
still has a mystery.

677
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,920
What mystery?

678
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,920
Actually, since she was a child,

679
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,920
she has always appeared in my dreams.

680
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,920
There's such a thing?

681
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,920
It means it's the natural law

682
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,920
that made you and Madam Yan

683
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,920
have this fate.

684
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,920
I never believed in the natural law.

685
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,920
But I believe

686
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,920
it's the natural law.

687
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,920
You're right.

688
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,920
You're right.

689
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,920
Now the situation is so bad.

690
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,920
You should be cautious.

691
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,920
It's right.

692
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,920
But I think

693
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,920
sometimes

694
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,920
you should be open-minded

695
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,920
and feel everything.

696
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,920
Master Yan.

697
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,920
I think

698
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,920
I can sell you a body.

699
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:27,920
Kill her!

700
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,920
I won't kill anyone.

701
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,920
If she doesn't die, you will too.

702
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,920
And more people will die.

703
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,920
Okay.

704
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,440
Do you remember what I taught you?

705
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,320
Do it.

706
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,200
Why do you have to push me?

707
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,120
Boss.

708
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,400
Why are you still dead?

709
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,960
Is the poison attack black,

710
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,160
or do you havees french fries?

711
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,400
No.

712
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,080
I was dreaming another dream.

713
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:45,060
Sister Identity

714
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:46,520
What's history?

715
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,800
The most controversy in Secret Circuit

How to pay

00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,200
Who are you?

732
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:27,800
What's your purpose?

733
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,240
You're not a man.

734
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,240
You're a woman.

735
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,240
You're a man.

736
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,240
You're a woman.

00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,240
You're a woman.

You're a woman.

You're a woman.
