 ♫ Endless splendor

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,340
 ♫ Turns to dust between my fingers
in an instant ♫ 

7
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,120
 ♫ When the line
between good and evil is clear ♫ 

8
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,240
 ♫ Countless souls drift
into the boundless wilds ♫ 

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,600
 ♫ Carrying the spirit fire forward ♫

 ♫ I defy fate Just to remain by your side ♫ 

11
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,820
 ♫ Falling into love's abyss ♫ 

12
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,660
 ♫ Like heavy rain pouring down ♫

 ♫ In a blink, love and hate
vanish into illusion ♫ 

15
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,280
 ♫ Falling into endless love ♫ 

16
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,420
 ♫ Stirring waves upending a lifetime ♫ 

17
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,660
 ♫ Even if this life leads to ruin ♫ 

18
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:26,920
 ♫ I still choose to be entangled with you ♫ 

19
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,225
 ♫ Through all lifetimes ♫ 

20
00:01:30,225 --> 00:01:36,480
 

21
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,454
 

22
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,500
I instructed you to find someone,
not to abduct them.

23
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,210
My Lord, this lady came here of her own accord.

24
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:04,470
Why would she cry this much
if she truly came here of her own accord?

25
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:12,500
Your Majesty, this girl
actually knows your identity.

26
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,660
What's your name?

27
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,690
Liao Ting Yan.

28
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:57,340
 Why did she enter my dream without permission
and stir my heart? 

29
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,520
 Why did she show up here 

30
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,650
 by coincidence? 

31
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,730
 There's something more to this
than meets the eye. 

32
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:13,840
 I cannot just let my guard down
because of that dream. 

33
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,880
Why did you cry?

34
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,870
In the realm of mortals,
absence stirs no grief.

35
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,050
But when we meet again, grief blossoms at once.

36
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,980
Do you know me?

37
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,470
Of course I know you.

38
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,520
Have we met before?

39
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,130
This is our first encounter in this lifetime.

40
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,880
In this lifetime?

41
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,580
 ♫ Mountains and rivers shatter before my eyes ♫ 

42
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,780
 ♫ Endless splendor
cultivated through lifetimes ♫ 

43
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,740
If so, why did you come to me?

44
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,640
Just to see you.

45
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,390
You look the same.

46
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:04,730
However, those clear eyes, the gentle contours,

47
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,790
and that tender face brimming with freshness...

48
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:13,860
Are you the legendary 19-year-old boy?

49
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,620
 ♫ Like heavy rain pouring down ♫ 

50
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,600
 ♫ Drunk on romance. In a blink ♫ 

51
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,400
 ♫ Love and hate vanish into illusion ♫ 

52
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,370
What nonsense are you talking about?

53
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,540
Do you know who I am?

54
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,760
You are Sima Jiao.

55
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,900
You're the emperor of Hu Kingdom.

56
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:52,190
If so, have you heard that I've slain countless lives?

57
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:01,050
I once peeled the skin of an individual
who criticized me harshly

58
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,100
and hung it on the palace wall

59
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,710
until the wind and rain wore him down,

60
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,550
leaving nothing but a white skeleton.

61
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,320
 In the past, you would vanquish
one's clan for no reason. 

62
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,030
 You would blow up half of
Gengchen Celestial Palace with a spell. 

63
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:19,040
 You would reduce demon generals to ashes just so you could use them as fertilizer. 

64
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,980
I'm not one to appreciate delicate beauty.

65
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:32,460
- What are you smiling at?
- I'm smiling at how adorable you've become.

66
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,320
 ♫ Stirring waves, upending a lifetime ♫ 

67
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,540
 ♫ Even if this life leads to ruin ♫ 

68
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,970
 ♫ I still choose to be entangled with you ♫ 

69
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,300
 ♫ Through all lifetimes ♫ 

70
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,670
I finally see you again.

71
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,340
Your body is fine now.

72
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,180
But you've lost all of your spiritual power.

73
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,800
You still look the same.

74
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:31,030
However, there's something different
about you somehow.

75
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:39,580
Now, your face bears a hint of living warmth.

76
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,330
You no longer look as pale as before.

77
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:48,200
I'm sure your life will be much more peaceful

78
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,910
as a mortal in this lifetime.

79
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,860
 I'm going to die soon. 

80
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,040
 Heaven may want me dead, 

81
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,910
 but I won't hand my life to it. 

82
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,960
Would you have been this carefree all along

83
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,490
without the memories we had together?

84
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:53,510
Your Majesty, we found the individual
who rescued Wei Xian Yu.

85
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,810
Is that her?

86
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,750
Have you identified the individual?

87
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,890
We haven't gotten our hands on any leads yet.

88
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,300
I fell asleep for no reason last night.

89
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,770
Could it be that she has done something to me?

90
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,100
 If she's one of
the Marquis of Nanyan's retainers, 

91
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,680
 entering my dream must be one of their plots. 

92
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,460
Get ready.

93
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,700
I'm going to take her to the palace.

94
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,490
But...

95
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,820
Her background is still unknown.

96
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,160
Your Majesty, no matter how much you like her,

97
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,040
it's inappropriate
to take her back to the palace.

98
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,980
She's not a mortal.

99
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,100
With our current strength,

100
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,390
I'm afraid we can't do anything about her.

101
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:41,210
I just don't want to
alert her to our intention.

102
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,490
Since she approached me on purpose,

103
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,370
I'll pretend to follow her will

104
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,980
and take her back to the palace.

105
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,250
Your Majesty, you rarely speak.

106
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,910
But you spoke quite a lot
just to explain yourself.

107
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,940
I shall make the preparations.

108
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,100
Since when did food
from the mortal realm become this good?

109
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,680
The mortal realm?

110
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,570
Are you trying to say that you aren't a mortal?

111
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,650
You can treat me as a fairy.

112
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:48,100
Do you think such words alone
are enough to entice me?

113
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,180
In your current state,

114
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,890
it's normal for you not to trust me.

115
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:55,180
But I'm curious about something.

116
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,910
What is it?

117
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,120
How should I entice you
so that you will fall for me?

118
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,320
Such audacity!

119
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,250
I know.

120
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,700
Judging from your personality,

121
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,220
you'll surely suspect me
for having an ulterior motive.

122
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,770
But now, you no longer have the Truth Spell.

123
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,510
I have no choice
but to gain your trust gradually.

124
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,000
Fine.

125
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,990
If so, from now on,

126
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,160
you shall be my spouse.

127
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,220
It's good to be young.

128
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,890
Even when you are spouting such nonsense,

129
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:41,090
I can't even be angry
when I see this tender face of yours.

130
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,500
The height of summer has yet to come,

131
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,530
yet look at how much you're sweating.

132
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:07,530
After being harmed by a conceited scum,

133
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,860
I was left with a heat-sensitive constitution.

134
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,530
Who's that scum?

135
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:23,160
Will you take revenge on my behalf
if I tell you his identity?

136
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,390
I might consider it.

137
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,250
He's something else.

138
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,540
You can't afford to offend him.

139
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:38,380
Is he even more powerful than I?

140
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,350
I suppose you two are equal.

141
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,400
There's a main road
leading to Yan City, you know?

142
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,820
Why must we go through the woods?

143
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,160
Aren't you afraid of bandits?

144
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:04,830
Why would I need to fear bandits when I have you with me?

145
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,400
I don't know any martial arts.

146
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,790
You said you were a fairy, right?

147
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,340
Even fairies aren't omnipotent, you know?

148
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,990
Otherwise, I would have
plenty of ways to deal with you.

149
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,060
Don't try to frame me. I did nothing.

150
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,130
It has nothing to do with you.

151
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,250
Seems like I have another headache.

152
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,530
Turn around. My master was a healer.

153
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,920
You'll be fine after getting some rubs. Come.

154
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,650
No need for that.

155
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,820
Even my imperial physicians
couldn't do anything about it.

156
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,560
Just turn around.

157
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:47,210
 Why is my heart beating so fast? 

158
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:49,610
 Don't tell me I fell for her just like that. 

159
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,340
 That's not possible. 

160
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,470
 No doubt it was her enchantments 

161
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,510
 that brought this ailment upon my heart. 

162
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,460
Relax.

163
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,980
Stop overthinking things.

164
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,160
 I mustn't sleep. 

165
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,610
 Even if his life was spared, 

166
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:13,560
 his soul was still damaged. 

167
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,600
 It hasn't merged well with his current body. 

168
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,210
 That's why he's having constant headaches. 

169
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:26,140
 Why must you make things so hard on yourself wherever you go? 

170
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:36,860
 Although these are
just normal pills in Serene Vale, 

171
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:40,930
 they're more than enough to cure a mortal. 

172
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,260
 Is she trying to poison me? 

173
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,730
Silly boy.

174
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:55,150
You don't appreciate
a delicate beauty like me at all.

175
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,310
Just sleep in peace.

176
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,610
Assassins! Protect His Majesty!

177
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,820
- They did show up.
- They did show up?

178
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,000
So, you're doing this on purpose
just so you could make the assassins show up?

179
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,040
He has excellent martial arts skills.

180
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,300
If I had no spells at my command,

181
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,280
I might not be able to defeat him.

182
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,440
So, he was pretending to be weak
and harmless all along.

183
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,060
Sima Jiao actually traveled to the mortal realm

184
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,990
and became the emperor of Hu Kingdom.

185
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:24,630
I assume he's trying to stop me
from unlocking Nine Nether Purgatory

186
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,660
and freeing my demonic forces.

187
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,690
Be careful!

188
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:07,650
Liao Ting Yan did make a swift move, huh?

189
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:11,140
To think that she has actually reunited
with Sima Jiao in the mortal realm.

190
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,750
With her protecting Sima Jiao,

191
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,580
this has become quite the problem.

192
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,740
I almost forgot.

193
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,200
I have to cast my spells sparingly and settle down as a mortal.

194
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,790
Keep him alive.

195
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:16,140
 Such petty mortal tricks won't work on me. 

196
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,760
Are you okay?

197
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,180
Imperial physician!

198
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

199
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:37,120
Madam Yan is seriously wounded.

200
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,240
But why does she look like she's...

201
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,110
It hurts.

202
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:56,300
Why have you... stopped bleeding?

203
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:06,100
- I...
- I saw an assassin stab you.

204
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,450
You were bleeding profusely.

205
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,680
How did you stop bleeding

206
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,240
in the blink of an eye?

207
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:16,540
Your Majesty, I'm sure you're mistaken.

208
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,170
It was just a scratch.

209
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:22,530
It may look scary, but in reality, I'm fine.

210
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,400
I shall treat Madam Yan's wound.

211
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,710
 If she's one of
the Marquis of Nanyan's retainers, 

212
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,710
 she'll surely try to kill me. 

213
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,710
 But she rescued me just now. 

214
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,500
 Seems like she isn't one of his retainers. 

215
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:45,520
 If so, what is the demon lady after by staying with me? 

216
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,960
I merely used some of my spiritual power.

217
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,340
What a useless body.

218
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,380
Sima Jiao.

219
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,260
If it weren't for you,

220
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:29,360
I would never be forced
to maintain my cultivation with another's blood.

221
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,560
I swear I'll pay you back for this.

222
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,922
 

223
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:47,170
My Lord, Wei Xian Yu's men tried to
assassinate His Majesty on his way back.

224
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:49,250
His Majesty has arrested them.

225
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,130
What about Wei Xian Yu?

226
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:55,440
He was arrested as well.

227
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,140
He has done a lot for me all these years.

228
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,680
I can no longer keep him with me.

229
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,940
It must've been tough on you.

230
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,370
After all,

231
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:23,000
I wouldn't feel at ease entrusting this secret to someone else to deliver.

232
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,710
My Lord, you're too courteous.

233
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:27,360
At present, Sima Jiao has grown suspicious.

234
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,350
My Lord, you must be careful.

235
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,570
Who are you?

236
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,880
Marquis, you have endured hardships
and bided your time for so long.

237
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,780
You did it so that
you could end Sima Jiao, am I right?

238
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:16,650
Speak. Who exactly are you?

239
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,550
Marquis, I came here
to discuss a plan with you earnestly.

240
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,940
I hope you can treat me with respect.

241
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,500
Madam. Please let me go.

242
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,880
We can talk this over.

243
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:46,510
Madam, why are you here?

244
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:49,350
I know what you wish to achieve.

245
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:54,730
I can help you seize the empire.

246
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,310
Why are you helping me?

247
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,370
Marquis, do you know what's on Mount Hu?

248
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:05,420
I only know that the monarchs of Hu
have all been bound to guard the place

249
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,680
generation after generation.

250
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,560
This Mount Hu was called Mount Feng a thousand years ago.

251
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,310
There's something I need within the mountain.

252
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,170
After performing the worship ritual,

253
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:20,440
the emperors of Hu would then obtain
the imperial seal that grants power to open it.

254
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,310
That's why I came here to seek your help.

255
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:31,460
Madam, why didn't you possess the emperor directly, then?

256
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:34,060
Wouldn't you be able to
achieve your goal if you did so?

257
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:40,210
It's because you and Sima Jiao possess the True Dragon Aura.

258
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,840
Did you say that I possess
the True Dragon Aura?

259
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,200
Heaven's mandate bestows upon
the royal descendants the True Dragon Aura,

260
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,470
even the deities cannot touch them easily.

261
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:57,400
Only those who possess the True Dragon Aura have the right to ascend the throne.

262
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,200
Sima Jiao is a fatuous ruler.

263
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,270
Therefore, Marquis,
I'm willing to help you take Sima Jiao's life

264
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,790
and aid you in becoming the ruler.

265
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:10,050
Madam, you're a reclusive deity.

266
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:16,160
It's normal for you to have no knowledge
about our worldly realm.

267
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,060
But Sima Jiao's worship ritual is nearing.

268
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:23,200
If he dies right now for no apparent reason,

269
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,310
even if I do become the ruler,

270
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:30,070
it will surely draw criticism from others.

271
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:40,560
If that's the case, I can act according to your will.

272
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:45,200
I will uphold justice
and eradicate treachery on your behalf.

273
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,310
However, if you act only by
the methods of the mortal realm,

274
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:52,200
I fear you will end up losing everything.

275
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,027
 

276
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,954
 

277
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,237
Thank you, Your Majesty.

278
00:25:12,237 --> 00:25:14,260
That's enough.

279
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:19,180
When you served as my companion reader, you dined and traveled alongside me.

280
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,040
Spare the formalities.

281
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:30,300
About the task I've assigned to you, how's the progress?

282
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,620
Your Majesty.

283
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,260
Wei Xian Yu has been escorted back to Yan City for a strict interrogation.

284
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:43,530
As for Madam Yan, the assassins said that they didn't know her.

285
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:48,080
She was never in contact with Wei Xian Yu when she was in Liyang County.

286
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:53,420
That rescue by the riverbank must have been a coincidental act by Madam Yan.

287
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,590
Indeed.

288
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:59,190
She isn't one of
the Marquis of Nanyan's retainers.

289
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:04,680
But there's something wrong about Madam Yan.

290
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:09,120
She's not from Liyang County
nor is she a non-local.

291
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,680
It's like she appeared out of nowhere.

292
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,070
Naturally, she's not a mortal.

293
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:21,020
However, if she isn't one of
the Marquis of Nanyan's retainers,

294
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,730
why would she appear beside me?

295
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,740
What is she up to?

296
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:30,320
Madam, are you saying

297
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,440
that Sima Jiao is assisted by a master as well?

298
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,710
Madam Yan, whom Sima Jiao
has brought back from Liyang County,

299
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:41,830
is a powerful demon lady.

300
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:46,510
Is that true?

301
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,820
Marquis, if you don't believe me,

302
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:52,070
you can tell your spies
to launch an investigation.

303
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,070
Madam, His Majesty
has given us his instructions.

304
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,220
There will be a palace banquet tonight.

305
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,650
Please prepare yourself and attend the banquet.

306
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,310
All right.

307
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:15,280
By the way, Sir Eunuch, what about the assassins who were after His Majesty?

308
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,100
Wei Xian Yu and his underlings

309
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,960
have all been taken into custody
and are now under interrogation.

310
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,610
Madam, please don't worry.

311
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,840
Have you guys obtained any results?

312
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,920
It'll be difficult to make him confess
who the mastermind is.

313
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,580
You see...

314
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:35,790
So, there's someone else besides Wei Xian Yu who's out to get His Majesty.

315
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:38,030
If so, isn't His Majesty in danger?

316
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,340
I don't know about that.

317
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:42,550
Madam, please stop putting me on the spot.

318
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:45,550
 Now, Sima Jiao has no memory of his past. 

319
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:48,070
 He's wary of me. 

320
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,960
 If I deal with the mastermind on his behalf, 

321
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,690
 not only can I protect him, but I can also dispel his doubts about me. 

322
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:58,470
Madam, please stop worrying about this.

323
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,990
Please rest well.

324
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,750
His Majesty was worried about your injury.

325
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,610
He instructed the imperial physician
to give you another diagnosis.

326
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:06,530
No need for that. I'm fine.

327
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,900
Madam, please do not decline us.

328
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:12,530
It's better to be safe than sorry. Imperial Physician Yi.

329
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,416
Greetings, Madam.

330
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,380
Imperial Physician Yi,
how is Madam's situation?

331
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,900
Her wound is no longer of any concern.

332
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,140
Madam, you were bleeding profusely
when the assassin stabbed you.

333
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,810
But now, it seems like it wasn't serious.

334
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:45,930
It was merely a scratch.

335
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,890
His Majesty is kicking up
too much of a fuss over it.

336
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:49,750
That means His Majesty is concerned.
 

337
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,360
And, Madam,
although this is your first day here,

338
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,750
His Majesty has already invited you
to a palace banquet.

339
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:56,210
His other consorts
have never received such treatment before.

340
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:59,260
His other consorts?

341
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,480
Do not gossip about His Majesty.

342
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:06,040
It's well as long as you're in good health.

343
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,600
For now, it is enough
to rely on dietary remedies to nourish your qi and blood.

344
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,690
Thank you, Imperial Physician Yi.

345
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,340
Liang Chen, Mei Jing.

346
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,160
Does His Majesty have a lot of consorts?

347
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,750
Madam, only you and Noble Consort Si Xian,
the daughter of Marquis of Nanyan.

348
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:28,860
As for the rest of them,
at most, they're Beauties.

349
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,900
The rest of them?

350
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,090
How many Beauties does he have?

351
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,690
Madam, you don't need to hold them to heart.

352
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,490
His Majesty brought you back personally.

353
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:38,140
As for the Beauties,
His Majesty was forced to take them

354
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,060
as they were forced in by the powerful.

355
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,510
They cannot compare to you.

356
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:45,720
So what? He still made them
a part of his imperial harem.

357
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:51,170
He has forgotten about me, yet I still have to help him with everything I have.

358
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:53,950
This is infuriating indeed.

359
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:56,310
Your Majesty, I've sent the imperial physician

360
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:58,440
to give her a diagnosis
as per your instructions.

361
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,640
Madam Yan's wound has indeed healed.

362
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,840
Your Majesty. Are you sure you want to keep someone like her by your side?

363
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,300
What if she has an ulterior motive?

364
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,270
Speaking of ulterior motive,

365
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:13,890
Marquis of Nanyan stayed at Chengming Hall until dawn, am I correct?

366
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:17,640
Indeed. Your Majesty, his actions were offensive.

367
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,940
Why aren't you infuriated by them?

368
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:27,110
That'll spice things up for tonight's banquet.

369
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,550
You truly have keen eyes.

370
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,880
Keen eyes, huh?

371
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,160
Madam Yan was stabbed
by Wei Xian Yu's bodyguard.

372
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:41,440
But her wounds have healed in just a day.

373
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,440
I heard that on the day Madam Yan
went searching for Sima Jiao,

374
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,680
the heavens displayed strange omens,

375
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,310
and fierce winds swept across the land.

376
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,750
Is that true?

377
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,780
Indeed.

378
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:56,920
Madam Yan is a demon lady indeed.

379
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,920
My Lord, there's one more thing.

380
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,970
His Majesty has instructed Madam Yan to attend the palace banquet tonight.

381
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:05,540
I'm sure His Majesty holds her in high regard.

382
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,400
Keep a close eye on the palace.

383
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,600
Report to me immediately
if they make any movements.

384
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,250
Yes, My Lord.

385
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:22,770
My Lord, now, you believe that Liao Ting Yan is a demon lady, right?

386
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,890
That was unexpected indeed.

387
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:30,310
Sima Jiao actually has
a demon lady by his side.

388
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:33,900
If so, doesn't that mean my daughter,
Noble Consort Si Xian, is in danger?

389
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:37,470
Therefore, our priority
is to get rid of Madam Yan,

390
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:38,990
who's been protecting His Majesty.

391
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:41,920
We mustn't let her foil our plan.

392
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:47,130
If so, the banquet tonight serves as
an excellent opportunity for you, Madam.

393
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:52,730
If you're able to get rid of Wei Xian Yu and that demon lady,

394
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:57,450
I shall join forces with you
and achieve great deeds together.

395
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,250
You may leave.

396
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:42,030
At today's palace banquet,
no state affairs shall be entertained.

397
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:45,240
My dear subjects, please enjoy yourselves.

398
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:48,480
 Thank you, Your Majesty. 

399
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,390
Thank you, Your Majesty.

400
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,860
Your Majesty, thank you for looking after me.

401
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:34,550
That dish was annoying me.

402
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,750
Why isn't Sister Si Xian here to crush her arrogance yet? 
 [Beauty Yu}

403
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:54,790
As usual, I've prepared gifts for you all.

404
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:59,150
I hope you all won't betray my sincerity.

405
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:02,120
Chancellor.

406
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,210
Yes, Your Majesty.

407
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,890
I'll start with you.

408
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:08,550
The views in Lingnan are impeccable.

409
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:12,560
Are you willing to live there
for some years to come?

410
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,690
You're just banishing him.

411
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,300
Your Majesty, please spare me!

412
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:26,300
I dare not open the door of Chengming Hall

413
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,660
and allow outsiders to enter again!

414
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,970
What are you saying?

415
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:33,490
Even if Marquis of Nanyan
and Noble Consort Si Xian

416
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:35,450
feigned illness and did not attend the banquet,

417
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:39,690
you shouldn't just badmouth them by saying that they are outsiders.

418
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:43,110
That's not what I mean!
Your Majesty, please spare me!

419
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:46,330
Your Majesty, please spare me!

420
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:48,400
Your Majesty, please spare me!

421
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,170
The Empress Dowager has arrived!

422
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:00,820
 Greetings, Your Majesty. 

423
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:03,190
You're already an adult.

424
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:06,500
Are you sure you want to
throw another childish tantrum?

425
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:16,380
 

426
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,550
The Sima Clan has already been vanquished.

427
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:21,260
There's no way their souls still exist.

428
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,990
I suppose only her appearance resembles her.

429
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:27,460
I suppose this can be seen as an act to make up

430
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:30,550
for Sima Jiao's regret in his past lifetime
for not receiving any motherly love.

431
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,220
This must be Madam Yan,
whom His Majesty appointed not long ago.

432
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:43,010
Why are you staring at me like that?

433
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,330
Indeed.

434
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:51,990
Your Majesty, when I saw your graceful
and extraordinary presence,

435
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:56,050
you reminded me of the goddess
in the temple back at my hometown.

436
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:57,800
Please pardon me.

437
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:01,180
You do have a sweet tongue.

438
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,720
No wonder His Majesty fell for you.

439
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,290
I want to know

440
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:12,550
where the goddess you mentioned is enshrined.

441
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,010
I wish to visit her one day.

442
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:18,390
Everyone, take your seats.

443
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,900
 Thank you, Your Majesty. 

444
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,700
I don't know

445
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,930
where your hometown is.

446
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:40,150
My hometown is in Shu.

447
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,760
If so, why did you head to Liyang County?

448
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,140
Madam, you have to answer
Her Majesty's questions.

449
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:56,510
My mother and I have raised silkworms
to make a living since young.

450
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:58,890
There was a severe drought last year.

451
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:01,380
My mother became depressed and ill.

452
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,250
In the end, she passed away from her illness.

453
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:09,860
So, I had no choice
but to take along the neighbor's daughter

454
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,840
and make a living together.

455
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:16,740
We only managed
to settle down in Liyang County.

456
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,780
I see.

457
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,240
Such a poor girl.

458
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:27,110
Since you've joined the palace,

459
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:29,930
you just need to serve His Majesty well.

460
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:31,820
We won't let you suffer again.

461
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,590
Yes, Your Majesty.

462
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:46,220
Your Majesty, since this is a fine occasion,

463
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:49,370
let me offer you a toast.
 

464
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:58,270
 I suppose there's no escaping
poisoned wine in the palace, huh? 

465
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,240
 Now, it has turned into fine liquor. 

466
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,800
 Sima Jiao, you're lucky
to have a gem like me around. 

467
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,750
 You should be grateful. 

468
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,400
 Demonic energy? Sima Jiao! 

469
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,620
 It's You Yan. 

470
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:35,020
- Arrest her.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

471
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:38,650
Why did she do that?

472
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:39,690
Why did she do that?

473
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:41,960
Why did she try
to assassinate him out of nowhere?

474
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,510
Are you okay?

475
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:54,670
Your Majesty, this is the Poria chicken soup
you love the most.

476
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,450
Her Majesty made it herself.

477
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:58,800
It took her several hours to prepare it.

478
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:00,660
All of you may leave.

479
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,570
Yes, Your Majesty.

480
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:04,190
Thank you, Mother.

481
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:06,190
I was negligent in my duty.

482
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,970
Sorry for the scare.

483
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,670
It's not your fault.

484
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:16,540
You didn't even touch your chopsticks during the palace banquet.

485
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:20,510
But that Madam Yan?

486
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,680
She had a great appetite.

487
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:28,280
She never gets upset

488
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,490
as long as there's good food.

489
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,920
Do not dwell on the endless matters
beyond this life.

490
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,890
For now, let us savor the current life.

491
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,280
She's an intelligent woman.

492
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,320
I was perplexed at the start.

493
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,630
Before, no matter how I tried
to slip someone into your arms,

494
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,280
you just wouldn't accept them.

495
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,640
But now, you actually brought a woman
back of your own accord.

496
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:55,550
After seeing her today,
I can tell that she's truly remarkable.

497
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,470
She's indeed different from the rest.

498
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,920
If you truly fancy her,

499
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,750
why don't you appoint her as the empress?

500
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,960
I don't fancy her.

501
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,320
You're my son.

502
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,540
Do you think I can't tell the relationship between you two?

503
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,990
Mother.

504
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,470
According to ancestral rites,

505
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:34,360
one must appoint an empress
before performing the worship ritual.

506
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:38,140
You have to appoint
an empress as soon as possible.

507
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:41,700
I saw how she conducted herself today.

508
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:45,110
She can definitely handle
the imperial harem without an issue.

509
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:50,260
What's wrong? Are you worried about her?

510
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:55,340
I once suspected that she was
on Marquis of Nanyan's side.

511
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,930
But she risked her life
to rescue me on numerous occasions.

512
00:40:57,930 --> 00:40:59,740
She should be unrelated to Marquis of Nanyan.

513
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,720
It's just that there remains

514
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:05,250
an unsolved mystery about her.

515
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:09,950
What unsolved mystery?

516
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:13,340
Actually, she has been

517
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,670
appearing in my dreams often since young.

518
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:20,770
Is that actually true?

519
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:26,590
If so, I'm sure Heaven

520
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:31,040
has led you two together.

521
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:37,800
I've never believed in the existence of Heaven.

522
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,280
Given the current circumstances,

523
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:50,240
I understand why you're being cautious.

524
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,590
But in my opinion,

525
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:55,850
sometimes,

526
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:59,640
you have to open your heart
and feel everything around you.

527
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,140
 Kill him! 

528
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,650
 I don't kill. 

529
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:32,990
 If he doesn't die, you'll die instead! 

530
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:35,450
 Even more people will die in the days to come! 

531
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:37,500
 Pull out the sword. 

532
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,100
 Do you remember what I taught you? 

533
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:57,450
 Do it. 

534
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:00,190
 Why must you force me to do this? 

535
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:07,580
 Boss, why did you run into the sword? 

536
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:14,030
 No. 

537
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:29,050
I dreamt about her again.

538
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,194
 

539
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:42,810
Greetings, Your Majesty.

540
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:45,700
How's your wound?

541
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:50,390
The imperial physician
already examined me. I'm fine.

542
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:56,890
Why hasn't the wound
healed as quickly this time,

543
00:43:56,890 --> 00:43:58,930
unlike before?

544
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,900
Fairies aren't omnipotent, you know?

545
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:07,860
In tales of the supernatural,

546
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:10,450
fairies always love all living beings.

547
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:15,490
But you're only devoted to me.

548
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,910
You're devoted to one individual.

549
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:25,960
Who exactly are you?

550
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,680
What's your goal?

551
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:53,940
