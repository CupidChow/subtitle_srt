3
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,700
 ♫ Heavens strike with thunderous wrath ♫ 

4
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,420
 ♫ Mountains and rivers shatter before my eyes ♫ 

5
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,580
 ♫ Endless splendor
cultivated through lifetimes ♫ 

6
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,410
 ♫ Turns to dust between my fingers
in an instant ♫ 

7
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,120
 ♫ When the line
between good and evil is clear ♫ 

8
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,140
 ♫ Countless souls drift
into the boundless wilds ♫ 

9
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,600
 ♫ Carrying the spirit fire forward ♫ 

10
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,880
 ♫ I defy fate ♫   ♫ Just to remain by your side ♫ 

11
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,840
 ♫ Falling into love's abyss ♫ 

12
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,760
 ♫ Like heavy rain pouring down ♫ 

13
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,560
 ♫ Drunk on romance ♫ 

14
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,300
 ♫ In a blink, love and hate
vanish into illusion ♫ 

15
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,240
 ♫ Falling into endless love ♫ 

16
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,440
 ♫ Stirring waves upending a lifetime ♫ 

17
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,600
 ♫ Even if this life leads to ruin ♫ 

18
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,020
 ♫ I still choose to be entangled with you ♫ 

19
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,825
 ♫ Through all lifetimes ♫ 

20
00:01:27,825 --> 00:01:36,580
 

21
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,900
 

22
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,030
In tales of the supernatural, fairies always love all living beings.

23
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,640
But you're only devoted to me.

24
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,660
You're devoted to one individual.

25
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,540
Who exactly are you?

26
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,360
What's your goal?

27
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,170
What does Your Majesty think?

28
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,062
You're so beautiful.

29
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:13,210
Are you trying to bewitch me and bring down my reign?

30
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:19,050
Does this face of mine really look so wicked?

31
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,260
Then you must want to
use the dynasty's fortune to cultivate.

32
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,440
But you chose me, a foolish emperor.

33
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,680
I am no demon.

34
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,540
Nor is Your Majesty a foolish emperor.

35
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,960
I know you took the throne at a young age, unable to rule in person.

36
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,550
Many wished you harm, scheming for power.

37
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,760
You only played the fool

38
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,190
to make your enemies drop their guard and keep your throne secure.

39
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,360
How could you possibly know this?

40
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,240
All Your Majesty needs to know is this.

41
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:03,270
No matter how many enemies surround you, I will always stand by your side.

42
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,690
This is how you slipped
into my dreams, isn't it?

43
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,890
Your dreams?

44
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,880
Your Majesty has dreamed of me?

45
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:42,530
Since you so want to know my purpose,

46
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,850
then I shall tell you.

47
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:51,430
We were once demon lovers,

48
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,080
our fates bound across three lives.

49
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,110
But Your Majesty died too soon,

50
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:01,750
so I had to come to the mortal realm to find you again.

51
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,610
What kind of demon lovers?

52
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:13,000
I was an otter,
and Your Majesty was a black serpent.

53
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,980
Absurd.

54
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:20,810
If it were true, show me your true form.

55
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,680
It's late.
You still have morning court tomorrow.

56
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,180
You should rest now.

57
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,400
No rush. We have all the time in the world.

58
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,210
Keep your word.

59
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,400
Our days together are just beginning.

60
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,780
 Mother was right. 

61
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,110
 Trust your own heart. 

62
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,450
You two may go.

63
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,450
I have matters to discuss.

64
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,990
Please reveal yourself, Madam.

65
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,350
So, you've received my little gift.

66
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:04,230
Yes. News just came from the prison.

67
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,520
Wei Xian Yu is dead.

68
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:12,420
Then will you join hands with me?

69
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,080
Of course.

70
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,760
I am willing to work with you, each of us getting what we need.

71
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:25,950
I've also heard that demon lady was wounded at the banquet.

72
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:29,350
That must have been your doing.

73
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,730
More than just wounded.

74
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:35,810
I've planted a trace of my aura
in her demon core.

75
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,900
It will flare up bit by bit.

76
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:44,120
Fed by the grudges of humans,
her core will swell.

77
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:50,490
Once it's out of control,
she'll help us kill Sima Jiao.

78
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:10,660
Your Majesty, this incense
soothes the mind eases pain,

79
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:14,210
and relieves your headaches.

80
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,460
How is Madam Yan?

81
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,370
I changed her medicine today.

82
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:26,500
But it seems Madam Yan
is using her own secret remedies.

83
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,420
Let her do as she wishes.

84
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,980
Your Majesty, punish me.

85
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,320
For what offense?

86
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,960
I told Marquis of Nanyan about Madam Yan,

87
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,270
but failed to learn
what was planned at the banquet.

88
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,390
That put Your Majesty in danger.

89
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:51,650
Your Majesty bore no grudge, saved my parents, and even kept me in service.

90
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,660
But I have been useless.

91
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,730
I've told you many times.

92
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:06,660
Your parents are my subjects.

93
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,690
Saving them was no favor to you.

94
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:13,830
He has not suspected you of anything.

95
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,580
That proves you've done well.

96
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,730
Just keep hiding your identity.

97
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:23,620
Thank you for the great kindness.
I'll take my leave.

98
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:33,060
Your Majesty, this was presented by Madam Yan.

99
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:51,490
It's a record of Marquis of Nanyan pulling strings in Liyang.

100
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,730
Why would she have it?

101
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:58,730
By offering this to Your Majesty, Madam Yan is showing her loyalty.

102
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:03,890
Your Majesty, Minister Chen seeks audience.

103
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,490
Let him in.

104
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,920
Your Majesty.

105
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,970
Grave news!

106
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,060
- What is it?
- The jailers say Wei Xian Yu is missing.

107
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:20,280
He vanished into thin air.

108
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:31,040
Declare to the world he has died in prison.

109
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,300
So...

110
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,980
that was Your Majesty's doing?

111
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,980
Yet the jailers swear since last night there's been no disturbance.

112
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,520
How did Your Majesty pull it off?

113
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,320
Sima Jiao, what are you doing?

114
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:16,030
You call his name in your dreams, yet wouldn't let him stay the night.

115
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:24,150
It's thanks to you that Wei Xian Yu confessed about the Marquis.

116
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,820
That account book in Sima Jiao's hands

117
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,260
will surely aid him.

118
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,820
 Thank you both for saving me. 

119
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,440
 You escaped this time,
but beware of the Marquis' men. 

120
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,770
 Beware of him? 

121
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,180
 What do you mean? 

122
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,880
 Aren't you sent by the Marquis? 

123
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,160
 Fool. 

124
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,710
 He meant to kill you. 

125
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:05,930
 Without His Majesty and Madam Yan, you'd already be a corpse. 

126
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,180
 No way. 

127
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,820
 My family is still with him. 

128
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,180
 He must know I could never betray him! 

129
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:15,070
 Only the dead keep silent. 

130
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:21,780
 Since he cast you aside, why would he spare your family? 

131
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:31,100
 Marquis of Nanyan!
I swear I'll make you pay in blood! 

132
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:36,560
 If you pledge to His Majesty, he'll help you avenge them. 

133
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,540
 Rest easy. 

134
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:48,040
 I'll tell His Majesty everything I know. 

135
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,820
Had you not warned me
to save Wei Xian Yu first,

136
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:55,010
he'd already be dead.

137
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:57,410
What brings you here?

138
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,460
Have you found You Yan?

139
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,700
Yes.

140
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,350
Nian Jiu followed Beauty Tong's demonic energy.

141
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,340
Though he found no trace of You Yan,

142
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:09,970
he did discover before her downfall, Beauty Tong had met with Marquis of Nanyan.

143
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,970
The Marquis...

144
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:15,490
He ordered Wei Xian Yu
to assassinate Sima Jiao.

145
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,500
Was he colluding with You Yan?

146
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,250
Highly possible.

147
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,470
If the Marquis seizes the throne,

148
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:25,980
then Sima Jiao will never achieve
whatever he seeks as emperor.

149
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,860
Dream on!

150
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,200
And I uncovered something crucial.

151
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,340
Hearing is false and seeing is true.

152
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,360
Come with me.

153
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:53,100
But... Madam Yan was just resting here.

154
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,940
Jiang Cha, guard Ziquan Palace with them.
 

155
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,410
Let no one know Madam Yan is absent.

156
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:04,020
Yes.

157
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,800
Chi An He and I searched
every corner of the Pavilion of Destiny.

158
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,770
What the Hu Kingdom emperor
most fears You Yan coveting is the worship ritual.

159
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,530
is the worship ritual.

160
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:19,580
And this is the very site of that rite.

161
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,660
&nbsp;

162
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,280
A barrier woven of spiritual power
in the mortal realm?

163
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:33,530
Clearly this rite is a key part of Sima Jiao's plan here.

164
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:36,740
He must know something we don't,

165
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:40,280
and rushed to stop it.

166
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,770
Then You Yan aiding the Marquis

167
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:46,590
must also be after this rite.

168
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,430
We cannot let them succeed.

169
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,370
&nbsp;

170
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,670
Even the Spirit Fire can't break this barrier.

171
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,180
There must be more to it.

172
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:06,210
If I can enter,
I may learn Sima Jiao's true plan.

173
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:21,700
If only Sima Jiao can regain his memory now, then all will be clear.

174
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,460
But he has lost his memory, and we cannot break this barrier.

175
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,400
Who knows what he and You Yan truly plot.
 

176
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,820
Why make him remember?

177
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:35,250
Better he just stay an emperor.

178
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:39,260
Yet whatever he and You Yan seek is tied to that throne.

179
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,730
So, I'll help him hold it steady.

180
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,800
As for You Yan, he's a master of hiding.

181
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,820
But we can use the Marquis
as bait to drag him out.

182
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,410
Madam, one thing puzzles me.

183
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,230
That demon lady just entered Sima Jiao's side.

184
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:58,220
Why is she so blindly devoted to him?

185
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,280
You may not know this.

186
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,870
Sima Jiao and Liao Ting Yan were demon lovers in a past life.

187
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,870
This life, they're fated to tangle again.

188
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,680
If that's so,

189
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:16,910
why not make use of it to our advantage?

190
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:26,610
You mean to press Sima Jiao in court?

191
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:31,300
An official proposed digging a canal

192
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,220
between the Lan River and the Chi River.

193
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:39,300
But the cost was far too great,
so I shelved it.

194
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:44,010
If we hang this on Sima Jiao,

195
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:48,580
and brand him a foolish tyrant,

196
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,730
it will serve us well.

197
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:55,300
But we'll need your help, Madam.

198
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,450
Speak freely.

199
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:02,680
I'll stir pressure in court,

200
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:07,580
forcing Sima Jiao to order the canal.

201
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:12,480
While it's being dug,
you need only create a disaster.

202
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,680
Excellent.

203
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,010
The grudges of the people will fester,

204
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:20,730
topple his throne,

205
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,960
and swell Liao Ting Yan's demon core,

206
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,000
so she'll finish him for us.

207
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:38,660
Marquis of Nanyan is really a master of deceit.

208
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,130
Just now in court,

209
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:44,060
he went on and on about building the canal.

210
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,770
He put on such an earnest face

211
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,460
that I almost believed

212
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,130
he was a loyal minister serving the realm.

213
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:56,040
I suspect he means
to trap Your Majesty in a dilemma.

214
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:01,440
I grew up under his teaching.

215
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,350
There isn't a single trick of his I don't know.

216
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:10,610
I'll wait and see

217
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,610
what new tricks he dares try.

218
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:14,550
Your Majesty stayed at Ziquan Palace all night,

219
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,540
then faced court affairs at dawn.

220
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,760
Perhaps you should rest.

221
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:24,060
No, I'll stay at Ziquan Palace.

222
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,930
Let's see when she'll return.

223
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:28,820
You think I'm so easy to fool?

224
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,540
Nothing but lies.

225
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:34,210
If I came here myself,
I knew Madam Yan was inside.

226
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,550
I dare not deceive.

227
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,970
The madam truly isn't in the palace.

228
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,180
- You...
- Stop.

229
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:46,020
- Your Majesty.
- Si Xian, such temper.

230
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:50,020
This must be Marquis of Nanyan's daughter.

231
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,880
Here to pick faults with me?

232
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,760
Your Majesty, I only thought
 

233
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,260
Madam Yan is far from home

234
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,060
and having just endured such misfortune,

235
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,570
she must be unsettled.

236
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,230
So, I came especially to visit her.

237
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:04,060
But this maid kept...

238
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,390
Still, no need to use force.

239
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,350
Yes.

240
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:25,480
Don't hurt yourself.

241
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,040
Weren't you to dine with me tonight?

242
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,070
 Yesterday, His Majesty refused me. 

243
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,590
 Why the sudden change today? 

244
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,690
Go prepare now.

245
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,200
Understood.

246
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,200
I'll return now to ready myself
for Your Majesty's visit.

247
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,530
Let's go.

248
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,050
Greetings to Your Majesty.

249
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,310
I specially prepared this tea for you.

250
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,140
It restores energy and calms the mind.

251
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,010
Having a headache again?

252
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:27,920
Dealing with Noble Consort Si Xian's father
in court by day,

253
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,470
and coaxing her in the harem by night,

254
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,660
how can you not have a headache?

255
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,940
And you weren't idle either.

256
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,470
I came to Ziquan Palace

257
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:43,940
and found you nowhere.

258
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,250
Where were you?

259
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,740
I didn't know Your Majesty would come so early.

260
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,140
I shouldn't have gone
to the Imperial Garden to practice.

261
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,010
But I came last night.

262
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,380
I couldn't sleep,

263
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,790
so I wandered the Imperial Garden.

264
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,490
And I got lost.

265
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,920
Madam, His Majesty searched for you

266
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,940
many times in the garden alone.

267
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:27,740
Well, I fell down a well. Do you believe me?

268
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,960
Deceiving the emperor is punishable by death.

269
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,180
Choose your answer carefully, Madam.

270
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,700
I don't wish to lie to Your Majesty.

271
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,700
May I simply not speak?

272
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,880
Have you thought of His Majesty?

273
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,200
He worried over you so much.

274
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,400
He waited here all night.

275
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,990
He feared you might never return,

276
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:14,270
feared Si Xian would seize on your absence.

277
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,750
So, he kept it quiet,

278
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,070
only sent men to search in secret.

279
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,940
Why won't you tell me?

280
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,960
If your head still aches,
let me massage it for you.

281
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,330
No need.

282
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,070
I made Your Majesty wait all night.

283
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,990
That was my fault.

284
00:21:53,990 --> 00:22:00,120
But I want you to know,
all I've done is for you,

285
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,010
not for anyone else.

286
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,420
I never doubted your heart.

287
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,490
I only wish you can be more open.

288
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:21,920
Forget it.

289
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:27,510
Do you know why
I wept the first time I saw you?

290
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,600
No.

291
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,140
I've waited 19 years for you,

292
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,570
fearing I'd never see you again.

293
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,490
I have so much to say,

294
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,250
so much to ask...

295
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,090
 Where have you been all these years? 

296
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,990
 Sima Jiao? 

297
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,850
 Sima Jiao! 

298
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:01,070
Then why don't you ask?

299
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:04,850
Seeing Your Majesty living well here now,

300
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,380
that's enough for me.

301
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,990
My headaches come from you.

302
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,530
You must answer for them.

303
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,050
Physicians have tried for years

304
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,330
and found no cure.

305
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,400
Yet you can ease it.

306
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,290
Even now,

307
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,680
you test me still.

308
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,850
You always keep secrets from me,

309
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,840
and won't let me wonder.

310
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,750
So many worries.

311
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,290
No wonder your head aches.

312
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,140
I am the emperor.

313
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,310
How dare you be so bold with me.

314
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:57,230
Even if you forbid it,

315
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,700
I've been bold so many times.

316
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,330
And you rather like it,

317
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,770
don't you?

318
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,710
At last, you smile.

319
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:35,260
So, your mood is lighter.

320
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:43,140
You wished only for my happiness.

321
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,490
Yet, I...

322
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,220
What is it?

323
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,900
I shouldn't have used Si Xian to provoke you.

324
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,530
Even without her, there are concubines aplenty.

325
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,990
Behind each woman in the harem

326
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:08,680
stands a faction with its schemes.

327
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,570
Though I must balance them,

328
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:14,140
I've never touched a single one.

329
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,360
But...

330
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,250
you are different.

331
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:25,140
What makes me different?

332
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:29,880
You are the one who wants nothing from me,

333
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,810
the one who visits me in dreams.

334
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,790
Time for dinner.

335
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:06,880
Won't you eat with Si Xian tonight?

336
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,290
No.

337
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,070
The Marquis forced me to build the canal.

338
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:16,470
Let Si Xian take that as my reply.

339
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:19,510
If the Marquis really colludes with You Yan,

340
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:22,290
then this canal is far from simple.

341
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:25,710
What's he scheming now?

342
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,330
About the canal,

343
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,070
if we build it, the people suffer.

344
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:34,440
If we don't, transport suffers.

345
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,510
The Marquis' pressuring me,

346
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:40,400
hoping to trap me in a dilemma,
leaving me no way out.

347
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,660
It does sound like there's no winning move.

348
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,490
But Your Majesty looks calm,

349
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,660
so you must already have a plan.

350
00:26:54,120 --> 00:27:00,680
I've ordered the canal
designed to suit the land,

351
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,960
cutting costs by thirty percent.

352
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,150
As for labor,
we'll pay fair wages to willing hands.

353
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:11,260
It may take longer to finish the canal,

354
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,510
but its benefits will last for ages.

355
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:17,950
The canal is truly a blessing for the nation.

356
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:21,230
Your Majesty should follow through,

357
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,510
perhaps even gain more than expected.

358
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,710
You are Heaven's chosen.

359
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,380
Heaven itself will aid you.

360
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:36,920
Demon lady, your sweet talk
only clouds my mind.

361
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:41,400
I told you, I'm a fairy.

362
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,080
Even if you want stars from the sky,

363
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,490
I'll pluck them down for you.

364
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:58,450
I don't want stars.

365
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,670
I only want a clear and steady court.

366
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,560
That alone will satisfy me.

367
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,290
If possible,

368
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,510
I'd rather be an ordinary man,

369
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,850
enjoy life's simple pleasures,

370
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,180
carefree and free.

371
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,600
 Here, My Lord. 

372
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,940
 Smells nice! 

373
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:33,230
Still, I've known since birth

374
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:35,880
that I bear the weight of Hu Kingdom.

375
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,400
All I wish is to keep this land safe.

376
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:43,190
Then let me see to your peace and comfort.

377
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:45,640
So, you may have both.

378
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,450
The warmth of everyday life and the throne.

379
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,470
Grand Preceptor, can't you see further?

380
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:02,080
The canal will divert the Lan River,

381
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:07,710
stop the yearly floods,
open the north-south waterway,

382
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:10,030
and bring wealth to the counties along it.

383
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:14,030
It will bless future generations!

384
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,560
Future generations?

385
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,120
Shouldn't you look to the present?

386
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,320
Since the late emperor's passing,
Yan Prefecture has suffered drought.

387
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:25,270
Countless go hungry, families ruined,

388
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:28,670
even children eaten by parents!

389
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,670
And now you want a canal?

390
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,750
Such a massive operation!

391
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:36,920
How many laborers will be dragged into it?

392
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,840
And so what?

393
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,800
Some sacrifice for glory lasting millennia.

394
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,030
Which weighs more?

395
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,950
My Lord, you are wrong!

396
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,400
The people are the foundation.

397
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,880
A strong foundation makes a stable state.

398
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:54,560
Draining the people will enrage Heaven and man!

399
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:59,510
When the people rebel, what legacy remains?

400
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:01,080
Enough, Grand Preceptor.

401
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:05,750
You've grown too old,
confusing right and wrong.

402
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:08,400
Better retire to your hometown.

403
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,840
Hey!

404
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,430
Your Majesty,
the canal has been debated for days.

405
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:15,510
Please, give a ruling.

406
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:23,940
Your words show such devotion to the people,
such tireless concern.

407
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:30,510
Sharing Your Majesty's burdens,
toiling for the people, that is my duty.

408
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:35,180
For this, I will give my all
and serve until death.

409
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:41,860
Uncle, your diligence puts me to shame.

410
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:47,250
Why not just take my throne yourself?

411
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,400
Your Majesty is now the ruler of a nation.

412
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:01,340
How can you still joke like this?

413
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,580
Without the worship ritual,

414
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,450
how can I call myself emperor?

415
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,210
Please, mind your words.

416
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:18,340
No need to take it so seriously, Uncle.

417
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,430
All right.

418
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:24,360
Since the Marquis insists,

419
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,940
then let it be built.

420
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,450
See Your Majesty off.

421
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:47,270
Send Chi An He and two demon generals

422
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,380
to help Sima Jiao with the canal.

423
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:54,360
You'll use the power
of the Immortal-Demon Ruler

424
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:58,120
to aid a mere mortal emperor?

425
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,230
He's not just any emperor.

426
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:02,290
He's my sweetie.

427
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,660
Fine.

428
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,560
But seriously, what is your true aim?

429
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,080
Sima Jiao told me

430
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,030
Marquis of Nanyan is pushing hard on the canal.

431
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:17,080
It must be a scheme
he and You Yan have plotted.

432
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,880
Then let's play along,
see what they're plotting.

433
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,770
We might even draw You Yan out.

434
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,230
Avoid farmland and villages.

435
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,800
That was Her Majesty's order.

436
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,180
Understood.

437
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,800
Wh-What's happening?

438
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,670
This flash flood is strange.

439
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:03,450
Why would it cross high ground
to hit the village?

440
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,240
It must be You Yan's doing.

441
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,190
Ting Yan cautioned us,
the villagers' safety comes first.

442
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,560
I'll go after him.

443
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,320
You guys stay here and guard the people.

444
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,530
Yes, sir.

445
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,210
 This useless body... 

446
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,010
 He caught up so fast! 

447
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:47,010
Oh no, he got away.

448
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,950
Nian Jiu, did you find You Yan?

449
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,320
He escaped.

450
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,670
Ting Yan was right.

451
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:06,160
The canal project is no doubt
a trap set by You Yan.

452
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,160
No wonder.

453
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,840
An He and I were working.

454
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,240
Everything went smoothly.

455
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,110
But just as we neared completion,

456
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:14,800
the dike was destroyed,
and the flood burst out.

457
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,890
We nearly lost it all.

458
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,500
Madam...

459
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:46,510
Liang Chen.

460
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,360
I'm sorry.

461
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,030
Are you hurt?

462
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,240
I'm fine.

463
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,210
Madam, were you having a nightmare?

464
00:34:55,990 --> 00:35:02,430
 It seems... the demonic energy
You Yan left in me has begun to stir. 

465
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:04,880
Your Majesty, urgent reports have arrived
from every province.

466
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,180
The canal was finished overnight!

467
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,550
Overnight?

468
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,680
Yes.

469
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,280
Villagers saw divine figures

470
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,030
guiding the flood into the channel.

471
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:16,920
And at once the canal was formed.

472
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,770
The officials' reports
even included drawings of it.

473
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,360
Now the people believe

474
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,150
it's due to Your Majesty's blessing,

475
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,890
a great fortune for all.

476
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,150
 I told you, I'm a fairy. 

477
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:43,430
 Even if you want stars from the sky, 

478
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,890
 I'll pluck them down for you. 

479
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:48,770
She really did pluck a star for me.

480
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:10,660
At least hide yourselves better next time.

481
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,370
Got it.

482
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:17,410
Grandmaster...

483
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,810
He's not dead.

484
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,920
Really, you guys.

485
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,150
Why barge into the palace?

486
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:31,280
I finally got Sima Jiao to trust me,

487
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,540
and now he'll start doubting again.

488
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:38,240
Your Majesty, when we were
working on the canal,

489
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,730
a sudden flood struck.

490
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:43,030
It was indeed You Yan's doing.

491
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:45,760
He possessed Bi An's body.

492
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,930
But... but I failed to catch him.

493
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,720
He escaped again.

494
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,880
We'll need another way to trap him.

495
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,580
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

496
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,320
Once Grandmaster regains his memory,

497
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,280
perhaps we'll know his plan.

498
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,810
That'll be too late.

499
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,990
Sima Jiao hides things from us all.

500
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:08,290
This must be deadly serious.

501
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,540
I must learn his plan soon.

502
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,840
Next time, send word to me first.

503
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,510
Don't barge into my chambers.

504
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:20,630
I... I just missed Grandmaster.

505
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,030
And you didn't miss me?

506
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,550
Of course I did!

507
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,660
If I didn't,

508
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:30,760
why would I bring your favorite Spirit Dew?

509
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,620
Thoughtful of you!

510
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,290
Earlier...

511
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,920
was someone else here?

512
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,470
No, no one.

513
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:14,290
You must've dreamed it.

514
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,730
 Sima Jiao! 

515
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:13,370
 Is it because 

516
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:17,110
 of that past-life bond she spoke of, 

517
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:19,770
 that I feel so at peace beside her? 

518
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,210
 But maybe, 

519
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,460
 at her side, 

520
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:32,980
 there are things I don't know. 

521
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,920
You must've all heard

522
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,290
the tale of the canal forming overnight.

523
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:45,060
Marquis, what say you?

524
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,840
Surely it was Your Majesty's blessing.

525
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,800
A fortune for the people.

526
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,150
And the rest of you?

527
00:39:54,150 --> 00:40:00,470
It must be Your Majesty's blessing,
a fortune for the people!

528
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:02,110
Good.

529
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:04,580
Then we are agreed.

530
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:09,630
But speaking of blessings,
since Madam Yan came to me,

531
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:12,320
everything has gone my way.

532
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,550
Even this canal's success

533
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,430
seems owed to her.

534
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:17,880
Indeed.

535
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,630
All thanks to Madam Yan.

536
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:22,920
Your Majesty is Heaven's chosen,
blessed without limit.

537
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:27,280
How can the credit go to her?

538
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,720
Why not?

539
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:34,280
Or do you, Grand Minister of Works,

540
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,320
have another explanation?

541
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,700
I...

542
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,980
What say you, ministers?

543
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:53,840
If so...

544
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,330
Your Majesty!

545
00:40:56,070 --> 00:41:00,150
It proves Your Majesty is Heaven's chosen,

546
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:03,320
and Madam Yan a goddess descended!

547
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:07,280
 Madam Yan's a goddess descended! 

548
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,580
 Your Majesty is Heaven's chosen! 

549
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,630
You promised me.

550
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,400
Why have you failed?

551
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,150
Are you upset about the canal?

552
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:23,580
It's more than that!

553
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,250
My daughter is suffering.

554
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:34,360
Now everyone out there
calls that demon lady a goddess.

555
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,430
I don't even know

556
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:42,140
are you helping me, or helping Sima Jiao?

557
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,550
Of course I stand with you.

558
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:48,720
Though the canal didn't cause disaster
as we wished,

559
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,760
the rest proceeds as planned.

560
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,680
I'll feed on the grudges of the people

561
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,950
to swell Liao Ting Yan's demon core,
bend her mind,

562
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,470
and have her kill Sima Jiao for us.

563
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:04,990
If she resists,
she'll have to burn away all her power.

564
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:08,110
Either way, we'll see him dead.

565
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:11,110
Your plan is so thorough.

566
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:13,180
Why come to me again?

567
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,660
I need you to gather a hundred boys and girls.

568
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:31,930
You might as well hand my head
to Sima Jiao yourself.

569
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,930
Don't be hasty, Marquis.

570
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,760
I'll conjure a great drought,

571
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:44,720
and use those children for the rite.

572
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,330
Drought and their deaths

573
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:50,210
will throw the people into chaos.

574
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,950
I never thought you'd be more ruthless

575
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:58,930
than that demon lady.

576
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:04,920
Great deeds need sacrifice.

577
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,720
We'll use that disaster's resentment

578
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,920
to feed her demon core.

579
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,070
- Then...
- Then, I'll back your petition

580
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:17,880
to brand Liao Ting Yan a demon, right?

581
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,540
Exactly.

582
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:25,030
I'll face the court openly,

583
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:27,760
but if anything goes wrong,

584
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,070
I'll take the blame

585
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:34,700
for killing children and spreading lies!

586
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,980
Don't you trust me anymore, Marquis?

587
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:46,400
Before the canal, I did trust you.

588
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,890
But now, I'm not so sure.

589
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,890
We'll discuss it later.

590
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,060
You're just a mortal, after all.

591
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,840
Fine.

592
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,770
If you don't follow my plan,

593
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,930
I'll make the choice for you!

594
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,840
- What's this?
- Look! Dead birds everywhere.

595
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,430
- Why are they falling?
- What's happening?

596
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:31,640
They're dead!

597
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:32,930
Why...

598
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:53,850
I'm not hurt.

599
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:57,210
Then whose blood is this?

600
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,210
The demonic energy in me has driven me to kill?
