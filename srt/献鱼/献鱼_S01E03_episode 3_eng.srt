 "In This World, I Only Love You - Tia Ray 

3
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,600
♫  Let the heavens release a mighty thunder tribulation  ♫

4
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,320
♫  Leading mountains and rivers so mighty and vast to shatter before my eyes  ♫

5
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,680
♫  Lifetimes of cultivation bring years of splendor  ♫

6
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,240
♫  Yet turn to dust between fingers in an instant  ♫

7
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,120
♫  When immortals and demons discern good and evil with a single thought  ♫

8
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,240
♫  Many souls escape into the endless wilderness  ♫

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,680
♫  I journey forward with the Spirit Fire in my veins  ♫

10
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,880
♫  I defy fate just to remain by your side  ♫

11
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,880
♫  Falling thousands of feet in love is like heavy rain  ♫

12
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,660
♫  Pouring down between heaven and earth  ♫

13
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:08,560
♫  Drunk in love  ♫

14
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,240
♫  Love and hate vanish in an instant  ♫

15
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,280
♫  Falling into an endless abyss of love  ♫

16
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,480
♫  Stirring waves upending a lifetime  ♫

17
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,640
♫  Even if this life leads to ruin  ♫

18
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,920
♫  I'd still choose to be entangled with you  ♫

19
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,325
♫  Through all lifetimes  ♫

20
00:01:30,325 --> 00:01:36,540
   

21
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,436
   

22
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,540
You came back from the dead?

23
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,240
You're still alive?

24
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,910
Girl...

25
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,560
I mean,

26
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,970
you didn't die after all.

27
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,460
Of course not.

28
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,980
I never meant to offend Grandmaster.

29
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,540
He was just giving me a lesson and a warning.

30
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,180
I will remember it well.

31
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,500
I will be more prudent.

32
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:13,020
How is Grandmaster today?

33
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,710
Him?

34
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,080
 No. 

35
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,940
 I can't spread gossip about the boss. 

36
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,760
Reporting to Senior Aunt, Grandmaster is doing perfectly fine.

37
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,620
Serving Grandmaster is a privilege.

38
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,600
Make the most of it.

39
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,250
So, when he said he would kill me, he was only trying to scare me.

40
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,450
Now that I think about it, Grandmaster does not act like one at all.

41
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,700
He acts like a schoolkid.

42
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,780
Maybe aside from being a little dull,

43
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,390
he isn't one to kill someone over every little thing.

44
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,560
   

45
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,350
 She can ease the burning pain of the Spirit Fire. 

46
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,810
If she truly bears no ill will toward me,

47
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,690
she could be a very useful piece in the game.

48
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,370
Undo the barrier outside the pagoda.

49
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,620
Say it is to catch a Demon Realm spy.

50
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,410
Open the gate.

51
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:42,190
Rats will slip in through the cracks.

52
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,530
At least I won't have to clock in for work.

53
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:19,430
I can sleep so well!

54
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,120
 No water left. 

55
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,260
This disciple seems to be favored by Grandmaster.

56
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,600
She comes and goes from the Central Pagoda.

57
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,730
Yes. I wonder what is so special about her.

58
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,820
Maybe only those with low cultivation can get close to Grandmaster?

59
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,390
Who knows?

60
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,090
How are you still alive?

61
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,940
Apologies, I am very low-key.

62
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,370
I haven't run into any danger yet.

63
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,650
You escaped from the main hall.

64
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,260
You got lucky.

65
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,460
You had better not have any vile thoughts toward Grandmaster.

66
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,130
Otherwise, you will die eventually.

67
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,490
What?

68
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,530
Worried she will beat you to it

69
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,730
and win Grandmaster's favor?

70
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:29,940
Her? Really?

71
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,530
Some low-grade spiritual root that came out of nowhere?

72
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,290
How is she worthy?

73
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,530
So what if she is low-grade?

74
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:41,980
Does cultivation and a noble background make someone naturally superior?

75
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:43,880
Of course it does.

76
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,340
What is it, Ye Ruling?

77
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,090
Just because you were born low,

78
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,760
you feel connected with her?

79
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,290
A word of advice.

80
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,170
You should find another companion.

81
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:59,540
Her status is even lower than your low-grade spiritual root.

82
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,250
Fellow colleague.

83
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,050
Senior Aunt, it is fine if you think I am useless.

84
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,830
But why resort to personal attacks?

85
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:11,290
You rely on your higher cultivation to bully those weaker than you.

86
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,490
Is that not being petty?

87
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,590
Utter nonsense.

88
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,320
Birds of a feather, indeed.

89
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,780
They insulted you before.

90
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,780
You had never fought back.

91
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,560
Why are you willing to speak up for me today?

92
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,410
They look down on me for being behind.

93
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:37,700
I accept that.

94
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,700
But I can't stand it when they use background as an excuse.

95
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,390
That is too much.

96
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,520
I may not fully understand what you are saying,

97
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,580
but I can tell you are not looking down on me.

98
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,090
You are so pretty and capable.

99
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,360
I can only admire you.

100
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,600
Here is my thank-you gift.

101
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,650
It is very sweet. Try it.

102
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,340
Thank you.

103
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,140
I really like it here more and more.

104
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:14,780
No clocking in for work, and I met a good colleague.

105
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:19,080
Although there are also those obsessed with office politics,

106
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,940
as long as I stay out of it, I'll be safe.

107
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,040
Clock in?

108
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,210
Office politics?

109
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,950
What are those?

110
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,600
I don't quite understand.

111
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,360
Just think of them as Serene Vale's special terminology.

112
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,640
I see.

113
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:38,170
Do you really want nothing from Grandmaster?

114
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:43,000
I am someone with little curiosity or ambition.

115
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,530
I just want to rot away comfortably.

116
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,850
Rot away?

117
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:49,290
As in, just keep breathing.

118
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,140
I want to sleep until I wake naturally every day,

119
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,650
eat well, and sleep well.

120
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,720
Really?

121
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:00,470
Those immortal sects claim they cultivate to save the world.

122
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:03,780
In truth, they all carry filthy desires.

123
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,820
You are different.

124
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,000
Even though you are bullied,

125
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,020
you still find your own comfort,

126
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,650
and stay true to yourself.

127
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:14,050
I doubt there's another disciple in these mountains

128
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,970
who can live as freely as you.

129
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,850
Are you talking about me?

130
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:22,050
I have learned the art of speaking.

131
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:25,290
But aren't you from Gengchen Immortal Mansion, too?

132
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:28,610
Why do you talk as if you are not one of them?

133
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,580
One of them?

134
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,860
I am just a stranger here.

135
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:50,380
From now on, we are sisters.

136
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,680
All right.

137
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,800
I actually came in without knocking.

138
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:10,070
Another tedious climb.

139
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,620
Can I not go up?

140
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,890
Follow me if you want to live.

141
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,380
 The road to work is too exhausting. 

142
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,980
 No benefits and no pay. 

143
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,460
 He is worse than a capitalist. 

144
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:07,900
 With my limited knowledge of fantasy worlds, 

145
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,800
 this must be valuable. 

146
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,140
Boss.

147
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,200
Do you hear a child crying?

148
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,270
Come here every day and water this.

149
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:26,020
When it thrives, I grow restless.

150
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,900
I grow murderous.

151
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,530
Are you serious?

152
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:35,060
Will watering it not put out the flame on the flower?

153
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,170
If you manage to put it out,

154
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,210
that would be a great feat.

155
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,440
Come with me.

156
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:04,260
 I thought the cultivation world didn't have overtime. 

157
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:08,260
 I never thought it would be worse than reality. 

158
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:11,290
 Where I come from, no overtime just means losing your job. 

159
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,500
 But here at Three Saints Mountain, 

160
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,980
 not working means losing my head. 

161
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:22,260
 What did I do to deserve this? 

162
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:26,400
 When will I ever be free of this demon? 

163
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,910
What are you thinking?

164
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,170
Boss,

165
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,530
I'm thinking you could go do something else.

166
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,730
I won't slack off.

167
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:41,900
You keep saying "boss."

168
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,260
What exactly is a boss?

169
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,140
A boss is someone I keep working for,

170
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,860
and he keeps rewarding me.

171
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,310
How is that different from raising cattle?

172
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,690
That is an interesting view.

173
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,130
People at my home say the same thing.

174
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,170
Why don't you use spells to work?

175
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,900
 Your cultivation is already low. 

176
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,530
 You are barely at the Qi Forge stage. 

177
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:12,020
 Above that is Foundation Establishment, Core Formation 

178
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,220
 Nascent Soul, and Spirit Transformation. 

179
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,100
 Then, Void Refining and Body Integration. 

180
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,220
 Then, Grand Ascension and Tribulation Transcendence. 

181
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,570
 You are at the very bottom. 

182
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,950
 Maybe the immortal officer who picked you made a mistake. 

183
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:25,020
 That is why you got such an opportunity. 

184
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,650
I guess my cultivation is low.

185
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,870
I'm not good at it.

186
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,860
I hurt my head before.

187
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,050
I forgot a lot of things.

188
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,930
You drank my blood.

189
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,740
You should at least be at Foundation Establishment.

190
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,490
 So, I am already at Foundation Establishment? 

191
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,810
I can cast spells now.

192
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,690
 She finally showed her Demon Realm identity. 

193
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,780
 At least she is more honest now. 

194
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,510
Come here.

195
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:22,290
 Why can't I live an easy life in this world? 

196
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,170
 Other protagonists are destined heroines. 

197
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,170
 I'm just an overworked corporate grunt. 

198
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,980
 No money, no days off, and I have to please the boss. 

199
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,860
 I typed on a keyboard every day. 

200
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,220
 Now I wipe with a rag! 

201
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,330
 Life without slacking is half the fun gone. 

202
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,690
 As if that is not enough, 

203
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,630
 I still have to deal with a bratty kid. 

204
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,140
 You brat! That hurt! 

205
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,690
 - I will burn you!  
 - You can talk?

206
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,530
 Is there anyone else talking here? 

207
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,900
Calm down.

208
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:55,620
In the cultivation world, talking flames are normal.

209
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,620
Little flame child,

210
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,980
I'm just following the boss's orders.

211
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,020
Please do not take it personally.

212
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,650
 Little child? 

213
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,410
 Do you know who I am? 

214
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,020
Why should I care?

215
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,410
I must follow the boss's order.

216
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:14,260
Sorry, our sect specializes in farming.

217
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,750
Bear with me. I will be quick.

218
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,100
 I may not beat Grandmaster, 

219
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,980
 but I can handle a little brat like you. 

220
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,620
 It feels like my body is being drained. 

221
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:31,520
 Why are kids in this world so full of energy? 

222
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,050
 Climbing these stairs every day is killing me. 

223
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,430
 I'm working harder than an ox, 

224
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:39,050
 but no pay, no contract. This is pure exploitation. 

225
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,620
 At least the boss is rarely around. 

226
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,900
 And Black Serpent is easy to get along with. 

227
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,020
 The work target spits fire, 

228
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,530
 - but it is manageable. 
 - That hurts! 

229
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,820
 I'll burn you alive! 

230
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:53,610
 Babysitting is no easy job. 

231
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,690
 Please, stop watering me. 

232
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,860
 It hurts. 

233
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,450
You can't even spit a spark.

234
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,860
That should be enough.

235
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:16,980
 Sima Jiao said you are also from Gengchen Immortal Mansion. 

236
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,930
 Then, do not water me again. 

237
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:21,020
If I do not water you,

238
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,860
how do I explain it to my boss?

239
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,780
 Are you not his woman? 

240
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,220
 Why would you need to deal with him? 

241
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:32,980
And where did you get that idea?

242
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,530
 Anyone he brings here is obviously his person. 

243
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:39,780
 You are a woman, so you must be his woman. 

244
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,510
 What's wrong with that logic? 

245
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:45,470
That logic is something else.

246
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:51,740
 Sima Jiao, don't look at me like that. 

247
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,140
 Feeding the Fengshan Spirit Fire with your blood 

248
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,900
 is the fate of the Sima clan. 

249
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,330
 Don't think that refining my avatar means you can escape me. 

250
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,170
 We live and die together. 

251
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:14,570
 This fate will follow you forever. 

252
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:33,220
Looking at it this way, Three Saints Mountain isn't such a bad workplace.

253
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,740
The only downside is that no one here eats or drinks.

254
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,290
I can't order takeout.

255
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,220
Life has lost a lot of fun because of that.

256
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:09,030
 Again? 

257
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,220
Boss.

258
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,050
Boss, there should be some distance between ranks.

259
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,790
Nonsense.

260
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,540
Is this how you serve people?

261
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,780
I'm already doing my best.

262
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:44,670
Speaking of which, we have never talked about an employment contract.

263
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,620
There may be no labor laws here,

264
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:50,450
but proper benefits should still be a thing.

265
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,570
Go on.

266
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,340
What do you want?

267
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,870
I guess asking for a salary is impossible.

268
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:03,450
At least give me weekends off. 
  (Homophones with "dual cultivation") 

269
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,730
So, after all that,

270
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,490
this is what you want.

271
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:19,020
If weekends off don't work,

272
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,160
can I have one day off a week?

273
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,370
Keep watering.

274
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,810
No slacking.

275
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:28,320
I heard you have been here for 500 years.

276
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,980
Does staying in one place too long

277
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,940
make both people and flames sick?

278
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,330
 It is all Sima Jiao's fault. 

279
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:37,290
 Heartless scoundrel. 

280
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,700
 Always making fun of me. 

281
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,670
Sima Jiao?

282
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,890
What?

283
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:46,680
Such a delicate-sounding name.

284
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:50,460
So different from the grandmaster.

285
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,880
 Fool! It is Jiao, as in "burned, not tender". 

286
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,100
Now that makes sense.

287
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,810
Why are you so irritable?

288
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:06,370
No wonder the boss says he wants to kill when you thrive.

289
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,420
 He is slandering me. 

290
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,260
 We do not share feelings. 

291
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:14,340
 You watering me and making me suffer won't make him feel better. 

292
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,170
Then, I'm working for nothing.

293
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,700
 With such a good opportunity, 

294
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,640
 why not steal the Blood Clot Flower? 

295
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,850
 Hey, you nasty, evil woman. 

296
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,180
 You know the truth and still water me? 

297
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,890
- Sorry. 
  - Stop watering. 

298
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:35,530
Between him and your tiny evil force that spits sparks,

299
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:38,660
of course, I will bow to the greater evil of the boss.

300
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,260
That is how office politics work.

301
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:46,850
 One day, when I recover, I will burn you to ashes 

302
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:50,460
 and scatter them in front of that cursed Sima Jiao. 

303
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,570
 My flower! 

304
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:10,950
 Sima Jiao! I grew this flower with your blood. 

305
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,220
 Do you not feel the least bit sorry for your own blood? 

306
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,160
Pick it up.

307
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,220
Do you know what this is?

308
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,330
It is a flower.

309
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,680
Petals?

310
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,160
Do you want them?

311
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,610
You tore the flower apart.

312
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:40,100
What would I want them for?

313
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,020
Looks like you have no idea.

314
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,240
And they still had you come here.

315
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,610
Yes.

316
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:57,910
No one told me anything.

317
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,980
 I'm not that close with my master or seniors. 

318
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,380
 They don't know any secrets either. 

319
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:08,930
 Besides, the more you know, the faster you die. 

320
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,110
The petals are yours.

321
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:24,250
 He's so generous to you. 

322
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,760
Generous?

323
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,850
The petals are pretty.

324
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:31,220
But what can I even do with them?

325
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,980
 You really have no idea? 

326
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,890
 This is a Fengshan Blood Clot Flower. 

327
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:38,050
 One petal holds a thousand years of cultivation. 

328
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:42,180
 Everyone in Gengchen Immortal Mansion is desperate to get it. 

329
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,980
This should count as wages.

330
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,020
 Help me, and I will give you more petals. 

331
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,850
No thanks. I'll pass.

332
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,780
Greed can kill you.

333
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:57,530
I wouldn't dare use an item like this.

334
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:00,050
What if I can't handle it and just die?

335
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:02,460
That is a common trope in novels.

336
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,780
My work is done for today.

337
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,940
I'm off now.

338
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,270
Bye-bye.

339
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:09,730
 Don't go! Stay and talk to me! 

340
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:23,330
You're leaving already?

341
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,770
I finished all my work.

342
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,220
Can't I leave?

343
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,130
Who said you're done?

344
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:34,130
 Why open your mouth and give yourself more work? 

345
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:36,210
Follow me if you want to live.

346
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,020
No more chores for you today.

347
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:50,590
You just need to learn a killing spell.

348
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,050
A killing spell?

349
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:55,390
Can I please not learn it?

350
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,790
Refuse, and I'll kill you.

351
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,350
Pick it up.

352
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,300
Draw it out.

353
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,020
Immortal Mansion artifacts

354
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,140
must be infused with spiritual power...

355
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,620
to be used.

356
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:47,160
But I don't have spiritual power.

357
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,370
Why do I have to learn to kill?

358
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:04,240
It will be useful in the future.

359
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,420
Grandmaster,

360
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:19,460
I'd like to confirm something with you.

361
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:23,570
So, we don't misstep in the future.

362
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:26,500
- Speak. 
 - Well...

363
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,780
You fed me your blood,

364
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,750
kept me by your side,

365
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,330
and are personally teaching me spells.

366
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:37,740
There are so many people on this mountain,

367
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:41,540
yet you're giving me so much attention.

368
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,620
Could it be...

369
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,460
that you like me?

370
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:52,610
You, a mere Foundation Establishment fledgling,

371
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,860
talking to me about affection?

372
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:57,690
How laughable.

373
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:02,130
My looks are pretty decent now.

374
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:05,460
I don't think it's laughable, right?

375
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:09,200
And what does liking me have to do with cultivation stages?

376
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,090
Mortal romance is beneath me.

377
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:18,700
Never say never.

378
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,660
An old house can catch fire in a flash.

379
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,420
Nonsense.

380
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,020
If not for your constitution

381
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:28,330
that tempers the Spirit Fire's manic energy within me,

382
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:30,960
you think you'd still be alive?

383
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,660
So, I'm basically a walking air conditioner.

384
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,460
Guess I was overthinking.

385
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,870
Sima Jiao really is emotionless.

386
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:45,420
Great.

387
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,910
Bye-bye.

388
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,850
 The piece is in place. 

389
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:02,870
 After 500 years, it's finally coming to an end. 

390
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,970
What is it?

391
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:17,610
I heard there's a disciple named Liao Tingyan

392
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:19,740
who walked straight into the Central Pagoda.

393
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:22,180
Mu Nisheng of Heaven Palace saw it herself.

394
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:25,970
We've tried everything, yet we couldn't get anywhere near Sima Jiao.

395
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:27,330
How did she manage it?

396
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:29,740
How she did it doesn't matter.

397
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:33,620
What matters is that the barrier around the Central Pagoda is unbreakable.

398
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:37,030
Yet that Liao Tingyan can come and go freely.

399
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,420
Could it be...

400
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,740
Could the barrier be gone?

401
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:46,680
If so, we can finally make our move.

402
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:53,450
 Tingyan has earned Sima Jiao's favor. 

403
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:02,830
Earplugs. An overworked laborer's best friend.

404
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,940
Brother Snake,

405
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,260
didn't we agree?

406
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,370
When you come, just drink.

407
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:29,290
No need to wake me.

408
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:32,650
Don't wake me when you leave.

409
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,780
Because of you,

410
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:40,180
I haven't had a full night's sleep in days.

411
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,980
A snake shouldn't be too polite,

412
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,720
do you understand?

413
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:50,200
Forget it. You probably don't get it.

414
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:56,290
It's like after a long day of work,

415
00:27:56,290 --> 00:28:00,090
an enthusiastic colleague drags you to dinner.

416
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:17,300
If I can't provoke you, I can avoid you.

417
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:23,820
Now, no one will interrupt my rest.

418
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,020
Ming Li,

419
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,200
you dare threaten me?

420
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,810
 Young Palace Master, you're as punctual as always. 

421
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,260
 Don't talk nonsense. 

422
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,260
 Where is the antidote? 

423
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,290
 The barrier between us still stands. 

424
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:38,740
 The Spirit Fire hasn't gone out. 

425
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,740
 Sima Jiao is still alive and well. 

426
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,370
 How could I give it to you? 

427
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:44,020
 I've already sent her in. 

428
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,820
 Whether your plan succeeds is up to the Demon Realm's luck. 

429
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,290
 What's it got to do with me? 

430
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:49,780
 Young Palace Master, 

431
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:53,310
 we're supposed to be on the same boat here. 

432
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,090
 If you don't give me the antidote today, 

433
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:59,610
 I'll expose Liao Tingyan's identity 

434
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,020
 and ruin your whole plan. 

435
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,460
 Without Liao Tingyan, 

436
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,810
 the Demon Realm will survive just fine. 

437
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:07,050
 But as for you, Young Palace Master, 

438
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:09,890
 there's nothing more the Immortal Mansion hates than a traitor tied to demons. 

439
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:14,716
 If your father found out you colluded with us to improve your cultivation, 

440
00:29:14,716 --> 00:29:16,130
 what would happen? 

441
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,050
 Right from the start, 

442
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:20,500
 you only pretended to help me advance, 

443
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,530
 just to lower my guard. 

444
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:24,810
 Then, you used demon poison to control me 

445
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:26,780
 and make me do your bidding. 

446
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,630
 It's been a setup from the very beginning! 

447
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:31,780
 Young Palace Master, that's not a fair way to put it. 

448
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:36,330
 You were the one who came to us for an alliance. 

449
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:38,780
 Right now, the only thing you can do 

450
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:42,500
 is to find a way to make Liao Tingyan act fast. 

451
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,850
Oh no, not again.

452
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,500
Liao Tingyan,

453
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,120
what are you doing?

454
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:07,610
 If I ask Tingyan to help me get close to Sima Jiao, 

455
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:11,810
 will she think I only befriended her with an ulterior motive? 

456
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:16,960
 But if I still can't kill Sima Jiao, my family will... 

457
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,240
 Why is the Black Serpent here? 

458
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,420
 That is where Tingyan lives. 

459
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,170
 Could it be... 

460
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,860
Help!

461
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,130
Tingyan!

462
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:51,210
This can't be good. That beast...

463
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:14,330
You bully others because you're the Grandmaster's pet.

464
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,700
You just do whatever you please.

465
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,980
Liao Tingyan did nothing to you.

466
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,830
Why devour her?

467
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:22,460
Spit her out, now.

468
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,980
Fine.

469
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:27,300
Since you refuse to comply, then I won't hold back.

470
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:36,870
Did I just pass out from the pain?

471
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:48,140
 Stubborn beast. 

472
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:10,370
Not even an ibuprofen pill around.

473
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,810
Ibuprofen...

474
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:18,640
Isn't Grandmaster's blood basically ibuprofen?

475
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:30,550
Brother Snake, what's wrong with you?

476
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,090
Tingyan, you're still alive.

477
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,930
Ruling?

478
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:43,180
I was about to ask you,

479
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:46,420
how did you end up climbing out of Brother Snake's belly?

480
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,740
I thought it ate you and tried to save you.

481
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:57,570
But I ended up getting swallowed myself.

482
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:59,660
Ruling.

483
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:03,610
You actually risked becoming Brother Snake's dinner for me.

484
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,940
I took its serpent heart.

485
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:10,050
Maybe there's been some misunderstanding.

486
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:12,820
Brother Snake actually isn't bad.

487
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:18,500
Maybe...

488
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,020
Maybe it meant no harm.

489
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:25,060
But I think it's too used to throwing its weight around.

490
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:31,520
As for the serpent heart...

491
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,740
I'll keep it for you for now.

492
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,870
If you dare scare people again,

493
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,220
I'll make sure you spend your life

494
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:42,310
as a little black serpent without a heart.

495
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:49,370
You were trapped in the snake's belly like a dark cell.

496
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:52,050
I'm trapped in a dark cell here in the Central Pagoda.

497
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:54,970
Life is just too hard.

498
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:00,780
But isn't Grandmaster quite fond of you?

499
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,980
I was even hoping to ride your coattails

500
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,700
and take care of him, too.

501
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,460
Where did that rumor even come from?

502
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,330
Fond of me?

503
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:12,370
He's just squeezing every bit of labor out of me.

504
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:14,750
Why would you want to please him?

505
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:17,210
Why not?

506
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:23,930
Or is it that you don't want to introduce me to him?

507
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:26,110
That's right, I don't.

508
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:30,660
That man has a stable streak of madness.

509
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:33,930
If he gets upset, he might kill you.

510
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:37,410
I'm not about to push my friend into a fire pit.

511
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,250
So, you're worried about me?

512
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:42,820
I thought...

513
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,070
Never mind.

514
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,860
Had your serpent heart taken?

515
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:13,020
Who's going to stand up for you?

516
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,910
The night of the new moon is coming.

517
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:23,770
The day we leave the mountain is nigh.

518
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,890
Brother Snake, you're here.

519
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:33,640
Please, have a seat.

520
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:37,140
Brother Snake, I wanted to ask you something.

521
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,260
You've been with Grandmaster for so long.

522
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,410
You must know his likes and dislikes.

523
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:44,760
How would one go about pleasing him?

524
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:59,290
Grandmaster, look at this table.

525
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,780
I polished it until it shines.

526
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:07,060
And the floor.

527
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:09,530
Not a speck of dust.

528
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,400
What do you want from me today?

529
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,580
Last night, my stomach hurt again.

530
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,520
It hurt so much I thought I would die.

531
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,690
Didn't you save me with your blood last time?

532
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:32,660
What do you want?

533
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,780
 I want you on call. 

534
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,890
 To donate blood for free. 

535
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,420
I just mean, from now on,

536
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:40,370
could you use your precious and treasured blood

537
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:42,660
to save me in time when I'm in trouble?

538
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:46,900
After all, this little body of mine can still be useful to you.

539
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,470
We can help each other, right?

540
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:05,140
You're bargaining with me.

541
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:11,200
I wouldn't dare.

542
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:14,180
It's a plea.

543
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:16,240
You want my blood?

544
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,850
It depends on my mood.

545
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,440
So, what would put you in a good mood?

546
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:29,350
 You poor thing, you even have to think about that? 

547
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,030
Kill someone.

548
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,010
Kill someone for me.

549
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:51,800
Isn't that a bit above my pay grade?

550
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:00,090
Grandmaster, don't leave.

551
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,260
Just wait.

552
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:06,150
I'll find out what else you need.

553
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:12,810
Grandmaster.

554
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,290
You've worked hard all morning.

555
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:17,450
Let me serve you.

556
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:19,060
I heard you have trouble sleeping.

557
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:21,140
From my years of work experience,

558
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:24,510
it's most likely caused by too much worry and stress.

559
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:27,660
 Brother Snake. 

560
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:30,740
 So, what would make Grandmaster happy? 

561
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,020
 Grandmaster likes pillows? 

562
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:40,580
 He can't sleep well? 

563
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,670
 He can't fall asleep? 

564
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:47,290
Ridiculous. What could possibly trouble me?

565
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:50,540
Anyway, I've brought a three-piece stress relief set.

566
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,490
With my special massage technique!

567
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:54,980
Why not give it a try?

568
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,780
 So, you're finally making your move. 

569
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,620
Relax, okay?

570
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,850
Boss.

571
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:18,290
See how I'm serving you with such sincerity?

572
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:22,850
I'm only going to discuss my benefits.

573
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:25,490
Can we renegotiate them?

574
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,430
What benefits?

575
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:33,410
It's about my blood again?

576
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:35,050
That's right.

577
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:40,810
Also, I've been working five days straight.

578
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:43,320
Five straight days without a break.

579
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:47,270
Not to mention two days off, I don't even get one. 
  (Homophone with "dual cultivation") 

580
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,780
How can you be so shameless?

581
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:58,470
How am I shameless again?

582
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:08,850
Pleasing the boss is so hard.

583
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:11,010
If I'd known earlier,

584
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:14,370
I would've learned more tricks from my colleagues.

585
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,350
 That Demon Realm spy... 

586
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:23,560
 eased quite a bit of the Spirit Fire's burn. 

587
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:26,020
 Maybe... 

588
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,680
 I can force the seal open. 

589
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,790
 Sima Jiao, are you insane? 

590
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:50,820
 If you keep acting recklessly, it can kill you! 

591
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:54,180
 Sima Jiao! 

592
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:19,990
