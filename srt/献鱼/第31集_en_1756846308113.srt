1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The world is broken in front of me

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The world is broken in front of me

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The world is broken in front of me

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The world is broken in front of me

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The world is broken in front of me

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The world is broken in front of me

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The world is broken in front of me

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The world is broken in front of me

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The world is broken in front of me

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The world is broken in front of me

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The world is broken in front of me

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The world is broken in front of me

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The world is broken in front of me

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The world is broken in front of me

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The world is broken in front of me

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The world is broken in front of me

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The world is broken in front of me

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The world is broken in front of me

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The world is broken in front of me

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The world is broken in front of me

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The world is broken in front of me

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The world is broken in front of me

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The world is broken in front of me

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The world is broken in front of me

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The world is broken in front of me

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The world is broken in front of me

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The world is broken in front of me

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The world is broken in front of me

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The world is broken in front of me

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The world is broken in front of me

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:46,440
The Long Ballad

32
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,520
Episode 16

33
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,160
It's not like grabbing someone to look for you.

34
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,600
My dust center.

35
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,520
She came willingly.

36
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,080
She came willingly

37
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,760
and cried like her husband died.

38
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,480
Your Majesty.

39
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,720
How could she know your identity?

40
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:30,760
Your Majesty.

41
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,120
What's your name?

42
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,000
Liao Dingyuan.

43
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,460
I've wanted to see you for three months.

44
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,520
But you still haven't come,

45
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,360
and you realized something.

46
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:51,960
The key

47
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,800
I can't achieve

48
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,400
is to turn you into a letter.

49
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,400
Why did you appear here

50
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,400
so coincidentally?

51
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,400
It's really strange that she appeared.

52
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,400
I can't be careless

53
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,400
because of that dream.

54
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,400
Why are you crying?

55
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,400
I can't drink if I want to.

56
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,400
We met each other.

57
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,400
You know me?

58
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,400
Of course I know you.

59
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,400
We met before.

60
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,400
This is our first time meeting.

61
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,400
This is...

62
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
Then why did you appear in front of me?

63
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,400
To see you.

64
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,400
You look the same.

65
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,400
But your eyes,

66
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,400
the lines of the river,

67
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,400
and your face that almost holds water.

68
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,400
Is this the 19-year-old brother in the legend?

69
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,400
What are you talking about?

70
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,400
Do you know who I am?

71
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,400
You are Sima Jiao,

72
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,400
the little emperor who protects the country.

73
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,400
Have you ever heard that

74
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,400
I kill people like horses

75
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,400
and kill people like horses?

76
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,400
No.

77
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,400
I kill people like horses.

78
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,400
I once

79
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,400
peeled a man who was a big mouth to me

80
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,400
and hung him at the gate of the palace

81
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,400
until he turned into a white bone

82
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,400
in the rain.

83
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,400
Did you ever want to kill a tribe

84
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,400
and blow up half of the Gengchen's mansion

85
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,400
and burn half of the demon's clothing

86
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,400
to make a flower grave?

87
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,400
I am not a man who loves the world.

88
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,400
What are you laughing at?

89
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,400
Why do I look so cute when I laugh at you?

90
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,400
I finally see you.

91
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,400
You are fine now.

92
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,400
Your body is fine now.

93
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,400
But you really have no energy.

94
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,400
You still look the same.

95
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,400
But you look so different.

96
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,400
Now you have

97
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,400
a little bit of human blood on your face.

98
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,400
You are not as pale as before.

99
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,400
I think you will be a mortal

100
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,400
in this life.

101
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,400
I am about to die.

102
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,400
God wants to kill me.

103
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,400
But I don't want to give this life to him.

104
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
If you don't have those memories,

105
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,400
shouldn't you be so free?

106
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,400
Your Majesty,

107
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,400
the man who saved Wei Xianyu was found.

108
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,400
It's him.

109
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,400
Did you find out his identity?

110
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,400
No clue yet.

111
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,400
He fell asleep last night.

112
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,400
Did he do it too?

113
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,400
If he really did it,

114
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,400
I don't think he would have been able to do it.

115
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,400
If it's a man-eating tiger,

116
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,400
then it's a conspiracy

117
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,400
in my dream.

118
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,400
Prepare it.

119
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,400
I will take him back to the palace.

120
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,400
Well...

121
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,400
I haven't found out the identity of this woman.

122
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,400
I'm afraid it's not appropriate for Your Majesty

123
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,400
to take her back to the palace.

124
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
She is not a mortal.

125
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,400
With our current people,

126
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,400
I'm afraid we can't do anything about her.

127
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,400
I just don't want to wake up the snake.

128
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,400
Since she deliberately woke me up,

129
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,400
I will follow her

130
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,400
and take her back to the palace.

131
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,400
Your Majesty, you are so considerate.

132
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,400
You have explained a lot.

133
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,400
I'll go prepare it.

134
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,400
The Palace of Humanity

135
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,400
Is it so delicious?

136
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
Human?

137
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,400
You want to say you are not a human?

138
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,400
You can understand me as a fairy.

139
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,400
Do you think

140
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,400
you can seduce me

141
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,400
with this kind of words?

142
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,400
With your current level,

143
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
it's normal not to believe.

144
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,400
But there is one thing

145
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,400
I'm curious about.

146
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,400
What is it?

147
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,400
How to seduce me

148
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,400
so that you can hook me?

149
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,400
How dare you!

150
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,400
How dare you!

151
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,400
I know.

152
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,400
According to your personality,

153
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,400
you must suspect that I have a plot.

154
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,400
But you don't have the truth now.

155
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,400
I just have to let you believe me.

156
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,400
Okay.

157
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,400
From now on,

158
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,400
you are Madam Gu's wife.

159
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,400
You are so young.

160
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,400
You said such a nonsense.

161
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,400
I can see your face.

162
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,400
You won't be angry.

163
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,400
It's not the day yet.

164
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,400
You are so hot.

165
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,400
What happened?

166
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,400
After being hurt by a selfish bastard,

167
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,400
I became a hot-tempered woman.

168
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
Who is that bastard?

169
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,400
I said you would avenge me.

170
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,400
I can consider it.

171
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,400
He is so great.

172
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,400
You can't afford to be angry.

173
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,400
He is even better than me.

174
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
Let's compete with each other.

175
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,400
There is a big road to Yan City.

176
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,400
Why do we have to go through the forest?

177
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,400
Aren't you afraid of meeting bandits?

178
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,400
I'm afraid of bandits because of you.

179
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,400
I don't know martial arts.

180
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,400
Didn't you say you are a fairy?

181
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,400
Fairies are not all-round.

182
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,400
Otherwise, I have a way to deal with you.

183
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,400
Don't be so cruel.

184
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,400
I didn't do anything.

185
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,400
It has nothing to do with you.

186
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,400
Madam Gu is too stubborn.

187
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,400
Turn around.

188
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,400
My master is a doctor.

189
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,400
I'll rub it for you.

190
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,400
Come on.

191
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,400
No need.

192
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,400
I can't even treat my doctor.

193
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,400
Turn around.

194
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,400
Why is my heart beating so fast?

195
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,400
Did she just seduce me?

196
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,400
No.

197
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,400
She must have used a demon.

198
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,400
She must have made me anxious.

199
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,400
She must have made me anxious.

200
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,400
Relax.

201
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,400
Don't think about anything else.

202
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,400
I can't sleep.

203
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,400
Even if she saved her life,

204
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,400
her spirit was still damaged in the past.

205
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
And now,

206
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,400
her body is not very well integrated.

207
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,400
That's why I always feel headache.

208
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,400
Why don't you go anywhere

209
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,400
and rest in peace?

210
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,400
You're making yourself so uncomfortable.

211
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,400
Although this is just a simple pill

212
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,400
in the Qinggu Heaven,

213
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,400
it's already useful

214
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,400
for the mortal body.

215
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,400
Does it have any use?

216
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,400
You little brat.

217
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,400
You don't know how to speak.

218
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,400
Go to sleep.

219
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,400
There's an assassin.

220
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,400
Protect the emperor.

221
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,400
Go.

222
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,400
You're here.

223
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,400
You're here.

224
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,400
You left the spirit world on purpose

225
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,400
to attract people to assassinate.

226
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,400
Go.

227
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,400
Good martial arts.

228
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,400
If I don't rely on magic,

229
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,400
but rely on the whole family,

230
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,400
I really can't beat him.

231
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,400
So this ancestor has been eating

232
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,400
the tiger's bone for half a week.

233
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,400
Si Ma Jiao actually came to the mortal world

234
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,400
to be the emperor of the tiger's bone.

235
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,400
He must have done it to stop me from

236
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,400
opening the nine-oil lotus root

237
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,400
and releasing my demon soldiers and demons.

238
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,400
Watch out.

239
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,400
Liao Ting Yan moves fast.

240
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,400
He actually met Si Ma Jiao in the mortal world.

241
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,400
He's protecting Si Ma Jiao.

242
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,400
This problem is urgent.

243
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,400
I almost forgot.

244
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,400
Use magic to secretly kill the people.

245
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,400
Liu Huo Gou.

246
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,400
You want to hurt me

247
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,400
with a little human skill?

248
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,400
How are you?

249
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,400
Imperial physician.

250
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,400
I'm here.

251
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,400
Madam Yan is so badly injured.

252
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,400
Why do you look...

253
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,400
It hurts.

254
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,400
Your blood...

255
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,400
How did it stop?

256
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,400
I...

257
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,400
I just saw

258
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,400
the assassin you were attacked.

259
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,400
Blood was like a pillar.

260
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,400
How did it cut through?

261
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,400
The wound is healed.

262
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,400
Your Majesty, I think you saw it wrong.

263
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,400
I was just hurt by the slide.

264
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,400
It looked scary.

265
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,400
It's actually okay.

266
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,400
I'll go clean Madam Yan's wound.

267
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,400
If she's from the South Marquis,

268
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,400
she must be eager to kill the enemy.

269
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
But she saved her just now.

270
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,400
It seems she's not from the South Marquis.

271
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,400
Then why did the demon girl come to me?

272
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,400
She just used a little spiritual power.

273
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,400
Such a useless body.

274
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,400
Sima Jiao.

275
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,400
If it weren't for you,

276
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,400
why would I use other people's blood

277
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,400
to maintain the martial arts?

278
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,400
I'll revenge you

279
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,400
for all the hatred.

280
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,400
My Lord.

281
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,400
Wei Xianyu's men

282
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,400
attacked His Majesty on the way back to the city.

283
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,400
His Majesty has arrested them.

284
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,400
Where's Wei Xianyu?

285
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,400
His Majesty also arrested him.

286
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,400
He's done a lot of things for me all these years.

287
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,400
I can't keep him anymore.

288
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,400
Thank you for your hard work.

289
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,400
After all, it's a secret.

290
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,400
If you tell others to spread the news,

291
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,400
I'm worried about you.

292
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,400
You're welcome.

293
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,400
Sima Jiao has noticed it.

294
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,400
You must be careful.

295
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,400
Who are you?

296
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,400
My Lord, you've been holding your heart for a long time.

297
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,400
Don't you want to end Sima Jiao quickly?

298
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,400
Tell me.

299
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,400
Who are you?

300
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,400
I'm here to make a deal with you.

301
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,400
I hope you can be reasonable.

302
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,400
I'm Gao Ren.

303
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,400
I'm Gao Shu.

304
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,400
My name is Gao Shu.

305
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,400
Gao Ren.

306
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,400
Why are you here?

307
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,400
I know about your plan to get the city.

308
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,400
I can help you get the country.

309
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,400
Why do you help me?

310
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,400
Do you know what's in this mountain?

311
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,400
I only know that the kings of the country

312
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,400
have to guard it.

313
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,400
This mountain is called Fengshan.

314
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,400
There's something I need in this mountain.

315
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,400
After the past king of the country went to the ceremony,

316
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,400
he could have the jade seal that opened the river.

317
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,400
That's why I'm here to ask for your help.

318
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,400
Then,

319
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,400
why don't you just put it on that little emperor?

320
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,400
Then you can achieve your goal.

321
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,400
Because Sima Jiao and you

322
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,400
all have the spirit of a dragon.

323
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,400
You mean I have the spirit of a dragon?

324
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,400
The Heavenly Father and the descendants of the royal family have the spirit of a dragon.

325
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,400
The gods can't do anything about it.

326
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,400
Only those who have the spirit of a dragon are qualified to ascend the throne.

327
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,400
Sima Jiao is so useless and useless.

328
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,400
So I'm willing to help you get the throne.

329
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,400
I'm a great man.

330
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,400
I'm not a common man.

331
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,400
It's normal.

332
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,400
But Sima Jiao's death is coming.

333
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,400
If he dies like this,

334
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:27,400
then I will be criticized even if I become the emperor.

335
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,400
In this case,

336
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,400
I can do things in your way.

337
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,400
I can help you get justice and get rid of evil.

338
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,400
But if you do things in the way of the world,

339
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,400
I'm afraid I will lose.

340
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

341
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,400
Enough.

342
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:19,820
When you were the half-d

343
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,400
How is it going?

344
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,400
Your Majesty,

345
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,400
Wei Xianyu was taken back to Yan City and locked up.

346
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,400
As for that Mrs. Yan,

347
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,400
the assassin said he didn't know her.

348
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,400
He didn't know Wei Xianyu in Liyang.

349
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,400
So he saved her.

350
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,400
It should be Mrs. Yan.

351
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,400
She was there by accident.

352
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,400
Indeed.

353
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,400
She is not from Nanyin.

354
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,400
But there is something wrong with Mrs. Yan.

355
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,400
She is not from Liyang.

356
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,400
She is not from other countries.

357
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,400
She is more like an empty person.

358
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,400
She is not a mortal.

359
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:19,400
But if she is not from Nanyin,

360
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,400
why would she appear by my side?

361
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,400
What else do you want to do?

362
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,400
You mean

363
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,400
Si Ma Jiao also has a strong and weak side?

364
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,400
Mrs. Yan brought back Si Ma Jiao from Liyang.

365
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,400
She is a low-educated witch.

366
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,400
Really?

367
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,400
If you don't believe me,

368
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,400
let the spies in the palace investigate.

369
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,400
Madam,

370
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,400
His Majesty ordered to have a banquet tonight.

371
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,400
Please prepare a meal for us.

372
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,400
Okay.

373
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,400
By the way,

374
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,400
Eunuch,

375
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,400
how are the people who assassinated His Majesty?

376
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,400
Wei Xianyu and his guards

377
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,400
are all in the prison.

378
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,400
Please don't worry.

379
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,400
What do you want to interrogate?

380
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,400
It's hard to get the person behind him.

381
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,400
Well...

382
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,400
Wei Xianyu has someone else behind him

383
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,400
who wants to harm His Majesty.

384
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,400
Isn't His Majesty in danger?

385
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,400
I don't know.

386
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,400
Please don't make it hard for me.

387
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,400
Si Ma Jiao has lost his memory.

388
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,400
He's so wary of me.

389
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,400
If I help him deal with the people behind him,

390
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,400
I can protect him

391
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,400
and help him get rid of his doubts.

392
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,400
Madam,

393
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,400
don't worry about these things.

394
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,400
Please have a good rest.

395
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,400
His Majesty is worried about your injury.

396
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,400
He asked the imperial physician to treat you.

397
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,400
No, I'm fine.

398
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,400
Don't push yourself.

399
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,400
I'm fine.

400
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,400
Please be careful.

401
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,400
Imperial physician Yi.

402
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,400
Greetings, Madam.

403
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,400
Imperial physician Yi,

404
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,400
how is my wife?

405
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,400
She's fine now.

406
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,400
When I saw her being stabbed,

407
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,400
her blood flowed like a pillar.

408
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,400
It seems that she's not badly injured.

409
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,400
She was just hurt by a small scratch.

410
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,400
His Majesty is too petty.

411
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,400
It means His Majesty cares about her.

412
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,400
And she just came to the palace today.

413
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,400
His Majesty asked her to join the banquet.

414
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,400
Other wives don't treat her like this.

415
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,400
Other wives?

416
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,400
Don't forget about it.

417
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,400
It's good to see you, Madam.

418
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,400
I just need to use the food to nourish my blood.

419
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,400
Thank you, Imperial physician Yi.

420
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,400
The scenery is beautiful.

421
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,400
Does His Majesty have many wives?

422
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,400
He only has you and the daughter of the Marquis of Nan Yan,

423
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,400
Lady Sisi.

424
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,400
The rest are at most beautiful.

425
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,400
The rest?

426
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,400
How many wives do you have?

427
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,400
You don't have to worry about these things.

428
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,400
Your Majesty, you were brought back by His Majesty.

429
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,400
Those beauties are just all-rounders.

430
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,400
They are all in here.

431
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,400
They are not as good as you.

432
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,400
So what?

433
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,400
He just came to the harem.

434
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,400
When I think of him, I forget that

435
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,400
I have to help him so hard.

436
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,400
I'm so angry.

437
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,400
Your Majesty,

438
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,400
according to your order,

439
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,400
I've sent the imperial physician to check her.

440
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,400
Madam Yan's wound is indeed healed.

441
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,400
Your Majesty,

442
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,400
do you really want to keep such a wicked person

443
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,400
by your side?

444
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,400
You said that she had a heart of gold.

445
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,400
Speaking of heart of gold,

446
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,400
yesterday, Marquis Nan Yan was in Chengming Hall.

447
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,400
He was brought to Tianming Hall.

448
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,400
It's true.

449
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,400
Marquis Nan Yan was so angry.

450
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,400
Why did His Majesty get angry?

451
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,400
Today's banquet

452
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,400
is more interesting.

453
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,400
Do you really want to keep her?

454
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,400
Yes.

455
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,400
Madam Yan

456
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,400
was obviously injured by the guards.

457
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,400
But in less than a day,

458
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,400
all the wounds on her body were healed.

459
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,400
I heard that

460
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,400
the day Madam Yan was looking for Sima Jiao,

461
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,400
there was a strange sound.

462
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,400
The demon was making a big fuss.

463
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,400
Is that true?

464
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,400
Yes.

465
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,400
Madam Yan

466
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,400
is really a evil spirit.

467
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,400
She is a demon.

468
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,400
She is really a demon.

469
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,400
Marquis,

470
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,400
there is one more thing.

471
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,400
His Majesty asked Madam Yan

472
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,400
to attend the banquet tonight.

473
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,400
I think

474
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,400
His Majesty is very interested in her.

475
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,400
Keep an eye on the situation in the palace.

476
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,400
If anything changes,

477
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,400
report to me at any time.

478
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,400
Yes.

479
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,400
Do you believe

480
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,400
that Liao Ting Yan is a demon?

481
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,400
I didn't expect

482
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,400
such a demon girl

483
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,400
to be in Sima Jiao.

484
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,400
Then

485
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,400
my daughter,

486
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,400
Lady Sixian,

487
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,400
is in danger.

488
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,400
So the priority

489
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,400
is to get Madam Yan

490
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,400
who is protecting Sima Jiao

491
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,400
out of here as soon as possible

492
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,400
in order to prevent

493
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,400
our plan from being ruined.

494
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,400
Then tonight's banquet

495
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,400
is a good opportunity for the masters.

496
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,400
If the masters can

497
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,400
kill Wei Xianyu and that demon woman

498
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,400
for me,

499
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,400
I will be able to

500
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,400
get rid of them.

501
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,400
If Wei Xianyu

502
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,400
and that demon woman

503
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,400
are in danger,

504
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,400
I will definitely

505
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,400
work with the masters.

506
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:48,760
Time for CS

507
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,680
Next time.

508
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,400
Thank you, Your Majesty, for taking care of me.

509
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,280
I just thought that plate of dishes was just for show.

510
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:36,400
Why didn't Sister Sixian come and see the mightiness of this wild woman?

511
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:54,400
As usual, I have prepared a gift for all of you.

512
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,400
I hope that you won't let me down.

513
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,400
Chancellor.

514
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,400
I'm here, Your Majesty.

515
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,400
You go first.

516
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,400
Lingnan has a beautiful scenery.

517
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:12,400
You can go there and play for three years.

518
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,400
You are really trying to make me feel at home.

519
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,400
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

520
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:26,400
Your Majesty, I will never open the Chengming Hall again.

521
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,400
Let the idle people in.

522
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,400
What are you saying?

523
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:35,400
Even if Nanyan and Lady Sixian are not here today,

524
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:39,400
you can't say that they are idle people behind their backs.

525
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,400
I didn't mean that.

526
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:45,400
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

527
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,400
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

528
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,400
The Empress Dowager is here.

529
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,400
Greetings, Empress Dowager.

530
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,400
How old are you?

531
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,400
Do you still want to be a child?

532
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,400
I'm already dead.

533
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,400
I can't leave any soul behind.

534
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,400
I'm afraid that this is just a skin-like thing.

535
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,400
This is also a compensation for the past life.

536
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,400
I won't have any regret about mother's death.

537
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,400
This is the new title of His Majesty.

538
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,400
This is the title of the Empress Dowager.

539
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,400
This is the title of the Empress Dowager.

540
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,400
This is the title of the Empress Dowager.

541
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,400
This is the new title of His Majesty, Lady Yan, right?

542
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,400
Why are you staring at me like that?

543
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,400
Yes.

544
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,400
I saw that the Empress Dowager is very graceful and noble.

545
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,400
She is very elegant.

546
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,400
She looks like the Goddess of the Temple in my hometown.

547
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,400
I'm sorry.

548
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,400
You're so sweet.

549
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,400
No wonder His Majesty likes you.

550
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:11,400
I want to know where the Goddess of the Temple is.

551
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,400
I really want to see her.

552
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,400
Everyone, please enter the banquet.

553
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,400
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

554
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,400
I still don't know where your hometown is.

555
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,400
My hometown is in the capital.

556
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,400
Then why did you go to Liyang?

557
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,400
Your Ladyship, the Empress Dowager asked me.

558
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,400
You can't not answer.

559
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,400
I grew up with my mother.

560
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,400
Last year, the world was in a drought.

561
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,400
Mother was in a crisis.

562
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,400
She died without knowing.

563
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,400
So I had to take my sister to Liyang.

564
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,400
Finally, I settled down in Liyang.

565
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,400
It's like this.

566
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,400
What a poor girl.

567
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,400
Now that you're in the palace,

568
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,400
I won't let you suffer anymore.

569
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,400
Yes.

570
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,400
Your Majesty, it's a beautiful scenery.

571
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,400
Please let me give you a toast.

572
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,400
As expected.

573
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,400
Indeed, the empty beans can't avoid the poison.

574
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,400
Now the poisonous wine is out of alcohol.

575
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:10,400
Si Ma Qiao, you can have fun with a magical baby like me.

576
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,400
Magic?

577
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,400
Si Ma Qiao.

578
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,400
Shi You Yan.

579
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,400
Take her away.

580
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,400
Yes.

581
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,400
Why did she do that?

582
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,400
Why did she do that?

583
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,400
She suddenly killed herself.

584
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,400
Are you okay?

585
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,400
Yes.

586
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,400
Your Majesty, this is your favorite chicken soup.

587
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,400
The Empress Dowager cooked it herself.

588
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,400
It's been stewed for hours.

589
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,400
You can leave.

590
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,400
Yes.

591
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,400
Thank you, Mother.

592
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,400
I'm sorry to have scared you.

593
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,400
It's not your fault.

594
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,400
I saw you didn't even move your chopsticks at the banquet.

595
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,400
But that Madam Yan has a good appetite.

596
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,400
As long as there is a good bite,

597
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,400
I've never seen her unhappy.

598
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,400
Mo Si has no poverty.

599
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,400
He has a limited cup of wine.

600
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,400
You have great wisdom.

601
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,400
I'm surprised.

602
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,400
You couldn't even put a person in your arms.

603
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,400
Now you've taken a woman back to the palace.

604
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,400
Today, you're a good person.

605
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,400
She's different.

606
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,400
If you really like her,

607
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,400
why don't you make her the Empress?

608
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,400
I don't like her.

609
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,400
You're my son.

610
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,400
Can't you see the little thing between you and her?

611
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,400
Mother.

612
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,400
According to the ancestral system,

613
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,400
before you go to the ceremony, you must be a empress.

614
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,400
You must hurry up with the matter of making the empress.

615
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,400
I saw her act today.

616
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,400
I'm sure I can help you settle the harem.

617
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,400
What?

618
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,400
You're worried about her?

619
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,400
I once suspected that she was a member of the Nanyan Duke.

620
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,400
But she risked her life to save her.

621
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,400
She should have nothing to do with the Nanyan Duke.

622
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:04,400
But she still has a mystery.

623
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,400
What mystery?

624
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,400
Actually, since childhood,

625
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,400
she always appears in my dreams.

626
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,400
There's such a thing?

627
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,400
That means it's the natural law

628
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,400
that makes you and Madam Yan have this fate.

629
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,400
I never believe in natural law.

630
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,400
Now the situation is so bad.

631
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,400
You should be cautious.

632
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,400
It's right.

633
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,400
But I think

634
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:57,400
sometimes you should open your heart to feel everything.

635
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,400
Kill her!

636
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,400
I won't kill anyone.

637
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,400
If she doesn't die, you will die.

638
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,400
More people will die in the future.

639
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,400
Take out the sword.

640
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,400
Do you remember how I taught you?

641
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,400
Do it.

642
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,400
Why don't you push me?

643
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,400
Boss, why are you still touching the dead?

644
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,400
No.

645
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,400
I...

646
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,400
I dreamed about her again.

647
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,400
Your Majesty.

648
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,400
How's Madam Yan's wound?

649
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,400
The doctor has checked her.

650
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,400
She's fine.

651
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,400
Why is your wound not like last time?

652
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,400
It's getting better.

653
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,400
A fairy is not everything.

654
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,400
Every fairy in the world

655
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,400
loves all living beings.

656
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,400
But you're so focused on me.

657
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,400
You're so focused on the artist.

658
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,400
You're so focused on the artist.

659
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,400
You're so focused on the artist.

660
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,400
Who are you?

661
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,400
Where's your heart?

662
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,400
The color of light

663
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:25,400
warms your cold soul.

664
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,400
Memories stop.

665
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,400
Missing you is clear.

666
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,400
But I can't keep it.

667
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:37,400
Searching for the pulse in the sand.

668
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:41,400
Becoming a firefly.

669
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:47,400
Light up all the darkness.

670
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:53,400
I'm alone with you.

671
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,400
I only want to go through the pain and the sorrow.

672
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:01,400
The rules of heaven are twisted.

673
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:05,400
Life and death are just like a dream.

674
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:09,400
I'm alone with you.

675
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,400
I only want to delete the past.

676
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,400
Right or wrong

677
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,400
Rumors spread.

678
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:23,400
The fate will be changed.

679
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:33,400
For you, for me, for the rest of my life.

680
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,400
The sea is clear.

681
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,400
The rain falls.

682
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:41,400
I'm the one who is in the crowd.

683
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:49,400
For you, for me, for the sincerity of my life.

684
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:53,400
Facing the promise, I will fly again and again.

685
00:46:53,400 --> 00:47:05,400
Use my body to light up the past.
