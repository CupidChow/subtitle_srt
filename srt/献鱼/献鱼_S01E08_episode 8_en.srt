3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,740
 ♫ Heavens strike with thunderous wrath ♫ 

4
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,480
 ♫ Mountains and rivers shatter before my eyes ♫ 

5
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,660
 ♫ Endless splendor
cultivated through lifetimes ♫ 

6
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:40,280
 ♫ Turns to dust between my fingers
in an instant ♫ 

7
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,160
 ♫ When the line
between good and evil is clear ♫ 

8
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,240
 ♫ Countless souls drift
into the boundless wilds ♫ 

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,500
 ♫ Carrying the spirit fire forward ♫ 

10
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,780
 ♫ I defy fate Just to remain by your side ♫ 

11
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,900
 ♫ Falling into love's abyss ♫ 

12
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,660
 ♫ Like heavy rain pouring down ♫ 

13
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:08,460
 ♫ Drunk on romance ♫ 

14
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,300
 ♫ In a blink, love and hate
vanish into illusion ♫ 

15
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,260
 ♫ Falling into endless love ♫ 

16
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,420
 ♫ Stirring waves upending a lifetime ♫ 

17
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,660
 ♫ Even if this life leads to ruin ♫ 

18
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:26,920
 ♫ I still choose to be entangled with you ♫ 

19
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,325
 ♫ Through all lifetimes ♫ 

20
00:01:30,325 --> 00:01:36,540
 

21
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,800
 

22
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,980
Always thinking about romance,

23
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:45,830
no wonder your people
never make any cultivation progress.

24
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,380
True.

25
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,310
 I've now mastered
the art of sweet-talking Grandmaster. 

26
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,830
Since my cultivation has greatly increased,

27
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,980
does that mean I can do a Solus Par Agula now?

28
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,360
Why did you put a slab of water on your face?

29
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,800
It's a facial mask.

30
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,990
When my power was weaker,
the mask kept falling off.

31
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:16,010
Now that I'm stronger, it sticks on my face.

32
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,540
What's the point of this?

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,510
It moisturizes your skin.

34
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:51,400
Seems like a beauty treatment is the most my power can achieve.

35
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,990
Senior Brother said this is good
for bruises and wounds.

36
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,110
It might not be the right cure,

37
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,470
but I'm sure it can be used as a band-aid.

38
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,920
I should go out before Grandmaster wakes up.

39
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,720
I'm sure it's fine
as long as I stay in White Deer Cliff.

40
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,670
 It's been 500 years. 

41
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,810
 This is the first time... 

42
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:41,040
 I felt a moment of drowsiness. 

43
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,120
 Was it because of her? 

44
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,830
 Is he having another headache? 

45
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,520
 Seems like it hurts a lot. 

46
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,000
 He's not concerned about the wound on his arm 

47
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,080
 because his head hurts too much. 

48
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,590
 Perhaps the wound on his arm 

49
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,770
 is insignificant compared to his headache. 

50
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,690
Ting Yan.

51
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,870
Me?

52
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,280
On account of your faithful servitude,

53
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,310
I can grant you a vacation.

54
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,770
Or do you desire...

55
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,760
Mr. Snake, do you need anything from me?

56
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,200
Ting Yan, here you go.

57
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,830
Ru Ling told me to hand this letter to you.

58
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,670
So, you met up with Ru Ling behind my back?

59
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,000
What did she say?

60
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,590
She told me to join her
in admiring the Scarlet Sky

61
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,960
at the hour of Mao.

62
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,160
According to her, it's a magnificent view.

63
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,470
What about me? Did she tell me to come along?

64
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,400
I don't think so.
It states that I should meet her alone.

65
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,000
The sky now looks like it's around 6 o'clock.

66
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,210
Should I depart now?

67
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,910
Mr. Snake, what's wrong?

68
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,320
Ting Yan.

69
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,470
Ever since Ru Ling returned my snake heart,

70
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:14,390
for some reason,
I'd miss Ru Ling's presence at times.

71
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:17,320
I don't think Ru Ling
did anything to your snake heart.

72
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,580
She merely kept it with her.

73
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,610
At most, it absorbed some of her scent.

74
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,110
If so, why did I obtain a human form, then?

75
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,150
I know now.

76
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,640
Your heart fell for her aura.

77
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,960
That's why you obtained a human form.

78
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,020
Ting Yan, what should I do, then?

79
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,110
How should I make Ru Ling fall for me?

80
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,440
Mr. Snake, you might not know this
since you just obtained your human form.

81
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,640
Relationships between humans have to be nurtured patiently.

82
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,880
Why not take Ru Ling as your master?

83
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,200
You can stay by her side,
just like how you'd stay by Grandmaster's side.

84
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,730
You'll have a proper excuse to stay with her.

85
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,830
But I already have Grandmaster.

86
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,880
How can I make Ru Ling my master?

87
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,640
Grandmaster would never agree to it.

88
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,270
You two have a close relationship.

89
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,420
I'm sure he'll agree to it.

90
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,790
I'm just a spirit snake.

91
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:18,480
How can I put myself
on the same pedestal as Grandmaster?

92
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,410
Don't worry.

93
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:22,170
Grandmaster is just bad
at expressing his feelings.

94
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,810
You're still very important to him.

95
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,790
I'll make a move now.

96
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,110
I...

97
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,330
Grandmaster.

98
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,000
Has Liao Ting Yan gone out?

99
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,450
Yes, she has.

100
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,590
For what purpose?

101
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,480
Grandmaster, she told me to tell you

102
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,630
that she has gone out to look for Ru Ling.

103
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,760
She's actually learned
how to act first and report later, huh?

104
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,390
Who delivered her letter to Ye Ru Ling?

105
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,930
It was I.

106
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,660
What about the task I told you to complete?

107
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,590
Grandmaster, from what I had observed,

108
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,590
it seemed like Yuan Che had no desires.

109
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,080
I don't think he has any weak spots.

110
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,340
However, he has a son named Yuan Shang.

111
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,600
I wonder if Yuan Shang is his weakness.

112
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,830
What else do you need?

113
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,760
I have another request.

114
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,880
I want to...

115
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,230
Speak.

116
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,980
I wish to make Ru Ling my master.

117
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,320
Grandmaster, please grant me your permission.

118
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,960
You've already taken on a human form.

119
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,890
You can make such calls yourself.

120
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,440
Do not bother me.

121
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,110
Grandmaster, is that a yes?

122
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,750
Thank you, Grandmaster.

123
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,470
Is this the Scarlet Sky?

124
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:08,650
It's so beautiful.
It looks just like the aurora.

125
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,940
 To commoners, this may be a beautiful view. 

126
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,450
But to me, it's a barrier
that I can never get through.

127
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:20,960
 Mother, do we have to stay here
for the rest of our lives? 

128
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,470
 After the Immortal-Demon War, 
 

129
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,230
 Yin Palace captured us from the Demon Realm 

130
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,230
 and brought us here as slaves. 

131
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,460
 We were bullied and humiliated. 
 

132
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,660
 Initially, I thought the new leader, Yin Liu Nian, was kind. 
 

133
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,220
 I foolishly gave away my true heart. 

134
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,160
 I never expected you two 

135
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,730
 to still live in a desolate place like this
with me after being born. 

136
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,510
 Right now, Sima Jiao
is the only surviving member of the Sima Clan. 

137
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:54,060
 Once he dies,
the Immortal-Demon Barrier will vanish. 

138
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,370
 By then, we can return to our hometown. 

139
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:01,470
 Mother, is there no other way
for us to return to our hometown? 

140
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,080
 The extreme-cold nature. 

141
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,940
 I heard that the Frost Fish of Demon Realm,
which has the extreme-cold nature, 

142
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,740
 can take us across the barrier. 

143
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,580
Actually, if we can get across the barrier
and head to the Demon Realm,

144
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:20,470
I'm sure the magnificent view we're seeing
will be even more charming.

145
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:23,180
Are you saying that the best viewing spot
is over there?

146
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,080
Can we head there, then?

147
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:32,440
- Ting Yan, you...
- Ru Ling, be careful.

148
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,980
It felt like I was electrocuted. That hurts.

149
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,010
You're still concerned about me at this moment?

150
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,080
Ting Yan.

151
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,340
Why were you hurt by the barrier?

152
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,940
Didn't you say that your body
has an extreme-cold nature?

153
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,370
Has it stopped working?

154
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:51,280
That's not true. What's with the question?

155
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,320
It's nothing.

156
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,750
It's my fault. I forgot to tell you.

157
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,800
After the Immortal-Demon War,

158
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,830
the Sima Clan set up
this barrier with Spirit Fire

159
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,800
to prevent contact between the two realms.

160
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,590
Therefore, beings of the Celestial Realm
and the Demon Realm

161
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,060
are unable to get across the barrier.

162
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,890
No wonder the reaction was so strong.

163
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,230
That hurts.

164
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,060
Are you injured?

165
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,560
Let me see.

166
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:23,490
 Why isn't Ting Yan's extreme-cold nature reacting to the barrier? 

167
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,590
Father, I found out that Yuan Shang

168
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:31,710
has been sneaking around White Deer Cliff.

169
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:35,710
White Deer Cliff? What is he doing there?

170
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:36,900
I think he was waiting for someone.

171
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,590
How dare he cause trouble
under Sima Jiao's nose?

172
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,820
Does he have a death wish?

173
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,503
What about this?

174
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:45,990
If he dies in White Deer Cliff,

175
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:49,510
we can push the blame on Sima Jiao.

176
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,160
Xu.

177
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,370
You've indeed improved.

178
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,940
Continue to keep an eye on him.

179
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:00,610
Find an opportunity.
Let Sima Jiao initiate contact.

180
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,750
After that, we'll go in for the kill.

181
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,360
Understood.

182
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,490
Is there anything delicious here?

183
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,040
My goodness. It's here again.

184
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,940
 Beside the Blue Lumina Blossoms,
under White Deer Cliff, at the hour of Zi. 

185
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,230
 If you don't show up,
your identity will be exposed. 

186
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,320
 And you will die in three days. 

187
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,160
Not only am I the chosen one,

188
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,430
but I also have another identity, huh?

189
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,760
Could it be that I'm the villain?

190
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,320
 Although I don't know what I feel guilty about, 

191
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,300
 I do feel guilty for some reason. 

192
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,430
Go and see him.

193
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,660
I waited so long for you!

194
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,960
It was difficult for me
to deliver the letter there.

195
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,280
I contacted you time and time again,

196
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,990
yet you never came.

197
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,630
You didn't even reply to my letters.

198
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,440
It seems you've found someone better

199
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,590
and are ready
to cut ties with me for good, huh?

200
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:53,970
 Is this the kind of heated outburst one gets when a couple turns into bitter exes? 

201
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,440
 It's just like a boyfriend finding out
that his girlfriend has cheated on him. 

202
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,320
 She never answers his calls
or replies to his texts. 

203
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,800
 Now that they're finally meeting each other,
his girlfriend is late. 

204
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,870
 He is complaining about that. 

205
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,370
 And now, they're getting ready to argue. 

206
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:05,080
What's wrong?
Are you too scared to say anything?

207
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,590
 Sima Jiao might've followed me here
to enjoy the show. 

208
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,810
 I have to mind my words. 

209
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:15,300
It's already over between us.

210
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,100
Do not look for me again.

211
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,400
You're something else.

212
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,680
How dare you betray me?

213
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,800
But don't forget.

214
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,750
Your life is still in my hands.

215
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,920
How is it?

216
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,320
How did it feel when the Bone-Eroding Venom
acted up yesterday?

217
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,220
 Oh my... Another attack? 

218
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,100
 It hurts... 

219
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,350
So, I had stomach aches because of you, huh?

220
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,630
How can a man like you,
whose love has turned to hate,

221
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,510
who uses strange poison to control his partner,

222
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,870
be worthy enough to have a girlfriend?

223
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,110
Even that darned Sima Jiao is...

224
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,580
Even Sima Jiao is better than you.

225
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,200
Bring it on, then.

226
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,430
Today, I'll sever the host's ties for her!

227
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,400
How dare you speak to me like that!

228
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,160
Are you not afraid of death?

229
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,040
Fine.

230
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,880
I shall grant your wish.

231
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,260
What's going on? Why are you still fine?

232
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:27,470
Could it be that Sima Jiao
neutralized your poison?

233
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,750
That's impossible.

234
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,800
If he did do so, he would've found out
about your identity.

235
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,350
If so, he would've killed you.

236
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,920
What exactly is my identity?

237
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,630
I'm just an innocent girl
who was deceived by my ex-boyfriend.

238
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:40,350
Everyone has lousy exes, you know?

239
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,440
You're still pretending to be ignorant, huh?

240
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,750
Have you forgotten about the task
I assigned to you?

241
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,280
Why have you not killed him yet?

242
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,500
-  So, you don't wish to kill me?  
 - I don't. 

243
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,230
 Why not? 

244
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,980
 You're already in so much pain. 

245
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,860
 Why aren't you trying to kill me? 

246
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,960
 Now, I'm seriously wounded. 

247
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,230
 This is a good opportunity for you to strike. 

248
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,860
 You've already reached the Soulshift stage. 

249
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:10,060
 How is it? Do you feel like killing me now? 

250
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:14,650
 So, Sima Jiao wasn't blindly paranoid. 

251
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,960
 It's just that the host of my body 

252
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,100
 came to Three Saints Mountain
to assassinate him. 

253
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:25,140
 Why didn't he kill me
when he knew about it long ago? 

254
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:33,580
Grandmaster is valiant and magnanimous.

255
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:37,040
Why would he hold it against me
for something as menial as this?

256
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,580
Fine. Sima Jiao may choose
not to care about your identity.

257
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,370
What about the others
at Gengchen Celestial Palace?

258
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,790
Do you think Sima Jiao will still defend you

259
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,960
if the sect master and the other palace heads

260
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,250
know about your identity?

261
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,710
Are you trying to threaten me here?

262
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,370
Stop obsessing over my identity.

263
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,820
Just save your breath.

264
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,680
I won't kill Sima Jiao for your sake.

265
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,350
Hey, you...

266
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,650
I still have your companion artifact with me!

267
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,020
Although I cannot control you now,

268
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,200
as long as I have it, I can...

269
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,880
I was just thinking about it.

270
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,240
How did it appear in my hand?

271
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:18,020
Continue. What'll happen
as long as you have it?

272
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,000
I'll kill you!

273
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,860
 You can't even defeat
a Nascent Soul cultivator? 

274
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,540
I did nothing just now.

275
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,550
Have I gotten this powerful?

276
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,060
You're just a lowly Qi Forge cultivator.

277
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,260
How did you become this powerful?

278
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,120
Right now, I'm a Soulshift cultivator.

279
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,050
A Soulshift cultivator?

280
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,200
 If he planted a spy like her among my ranks, 

281
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,040
 I suppose he's a fool himself. 

282
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,230
Sima Jiao actually went that far
for your sake, huh?

283
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:05,500
Don't think that your identity
will be kept a secret after you kill me.

284
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,690
Hey, you started the fight.

285
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,360
Can you stop being dramatic?

286
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,540
I'm not trying to kill you here.

287
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,550
You! Stop right there!

288
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,390
Did you betray me

289
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:22,940
because you fell for Sima Jiao?

290
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:28,240
That's not true. I didn't.
Don't spout nonsense.

291
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,210
 It'll be bad if Sima Jiao
is eavesdropping on us 

292
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,960
 and thinks that I fell for him. 

293
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,500
What a joke. Even if you do fall for him...

294
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,200
Shut up!

295
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,640
You mustn't spout such nonsense.

296
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,340
You'll fall sick easily

297
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,880
if you dwell on
such nonsensical thoughts all day long.

298
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,030
I suggest you go to a physician
and get a prescription.

299
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,470
Try to rest and recuperate.

300
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,030
Don't let your imagination run wild.

301
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,030
If not, you'll get yourself in trouble.

302
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,900
That's all I have to say.

303
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,580
You...

304
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,470
Who are you?

305
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,360
I'm Yuan Shang.

306
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,360
So, you're the weak spot of the Yuan family.

307
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,800
You actually came knocking on my door yourself.

308
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,210
So, she hasn't returned yet?

309
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:20,900
That man said he could
control me with this artifact.

310
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:24,340
I don't think it's working.

311
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,760
Grandmaster, you're still awake?

312
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,860
I'm so sleepy now.

313
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,080
You're already a Soulshift cultivator.

314
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,710
Do you still need to sleep?

315
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:44,550
I don't need it, but I want it.

316
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,270
It's just like how I don't need to eat,

317
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,510
but I want to eat.

318
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,530
You're indeed strange.

319
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:55,510
 Did he tail me or not? 

320
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,900
Grandmaster, have you heard everything?

321
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,410
If so, I suppose
you know about my identity, then.

322
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:04,970
No one can hide anything from me.

323
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:08,210
 But I don't even know about my own identity. 

324
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:12,050
Tell me, then. What's my identity?

325
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,180
You're an assassin who's after my life.

326
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,310
Tell me. Should I kill you or not?

327
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:21,920
 He would've killed me long ago if he wanted to. 

328
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,440
 Moreover, if he kills me now, 

329
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,690
 the blood he fed me yesterday
would've gone to waste. 

330
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:30,840
 I don't think he's that dumb. 

331
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,790
What's on your mind?

332
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,210
You touched the flowers,
and you didn't wash your hands.

333
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:43,070
After that, you put it on my lips.

334
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,300
Should I kill you or not?

335
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,790
- I don't think you should.
- Why not?

336
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,270
I've already switched to the righteous side.

337
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:59,590
Grandmaster, I'm on your side now.

338
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,680
- Are you calling me the righteous side?
- I mean, the dark side.

339
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,840
You do change your mind quickly, don't you?

340
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,260
You were useless.

341
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,770
You couldn't even defeat
a Nascent Soul cultivator.

342
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:14,550
Were you the one
who sent my ex-boyfriend flying?

343
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,450
What's an ex-boyfriend?

344
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,470
It's someone who shouldn't even exist,

345
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,940
and might as well be dead.

346
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,740
I suppose he deserves to die.

347
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,060
 Grandmaster is so nice to me. 

348
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:33,470
 He fed me his blood, and he taught my ex-boyfriend a lesson. 

349
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:36,230
 He's nice to me,
but he doesn't want me to find out. 

350
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,820
 What an aloof guy. 

351
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,050
Since you think he deserves to die,

352
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:44,640
you should've followed your will
and killed him.

353
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,820
You see, I just reached the Soulshift stage.

354
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,360
I'm no match for you when it comes to killing.

355
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,390
You're born to kill.

356
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,260
You'll get used to it after some killing.

357
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,680
Wh-Where are we going?

358
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,160
What else? We're going to kill.

359
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,180
I'm not going.

360
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,960
Get up.

361
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,780
I don't want to kill anyone.

362
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,200
What if I insist on making you kill?

363
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:09,680
You can kill me first.

364
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,370
Do you truly think that I won't kill you?

365
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:14,560
I think you won't.

366
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:24,450
Are you angry?

367
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:27,920
Grandmaster.

368
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:31,070
Grandmaster.

369
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:33,610
You see, this isn't my home.

370
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:36,230
It's not a place I'm familiar with.

371
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:40,930
And often, for no apparent reason, people always try to kill me.

372
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:42,970
Luckily, you're here.

373
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:45,270
That's why I can live like a carefree bum

374
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:48,400
in such a harsh environment.

375
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,880
So, when I say I'm grateful, I mean it.

376
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,870
I also mean it when I said I've switched sides.

377
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:04,920
Everything is negotiable
as long as you don't force me to kill.

378
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,300
Stop being angry, okay?

379
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,860
Test me with the Truth Spell
if you don't believe me.

380
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,120
Why won't you test me?

381
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,520
Shut up.

382
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,970
Fine, then.

383
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,860
You must be one of Sect Master Shi's disciples.

384
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,320
Help me.

385
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,790
Father.

386
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,070
Have you accomplished the task?

387
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,020
Yes, I have.

388
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,400
Yuan Shang is dead.

389
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,120
Before his death,
Sima Jiao cast Soul Search on him.

390
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,750
There will surely be traces
of his spell inside his body.

391
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,750
We can say that Yuan Shang
had a weak constitution

392
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,310
and that he died
of physical and mental exhaustion

393
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,990
as he couldn't endure the harsh interrogation.

394
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:23,820
This way, Sima Jiao won't suspect us.

395
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,380
It'll also cement his identity as the murderer.

396
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,400
Excellent.

397
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,880
I told you guys to keep an eye on Young Master!

398
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,710
How could you guys not know where he is?

399
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:41,970
Master, please be appeased.
I shall look for him immediately.

400
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,210
Who's there?

401
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,450
Are you the Grandmaster's personal bodyguard?

402
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:02,100
Why did you come here at this late hour?

403
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,140
Take a look.

404
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,780
Why...

405
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,900
Why are you guys
still not willing to let me off?

406
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:44,070
How are you dumber than a snake like me?

407
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:47,210
Do you think you could've lived until now
had Grandmaster not saved you?

408
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,990
What do you mean by this?

409
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,820
Are you saying that the Shi family
was out to get me?

410
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,520
Isn't it obvious?

411
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:57,920
You left a spell inside my body after you cast Soul Search on me.

412
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,160
So, you did it to save me.

413
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,780
What a useless fool.
I wasted my spiritual energy on you.

414
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:06,990
So, you found out that
I colluded with the Demon Realm

415
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,790
and planted Liao Ting Yan by your side

416
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:11,100
so that she could kill you.

417
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,740
If so, why did you rescue me?

418
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,160
What's your goal?

419
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:20,380
And, Sect Master Shi,
why was he trying to kill me?

420
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,400
How did Yuan Che give birth to a fool like him?

421
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:28,960
You may insult me, but do not insult my father!

422
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,550
So noisy.

423
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,200
Take him to Yuan Che.

424
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,920
Spare his son if he knows what's good for him.

425
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,920
If not, kill them both.

426
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,350
Shang.

427
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:56,260
So, Sect Master Shi targeted my son
and tried to push the blame on Grandmaster

428
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,160
so that I would seal Grandmaster away.

429
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,140
His sin is unpardonable.

430
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,160
Please thank Grandmaster for sparing him.

431
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,360
How will Grandmaster deal with Shi Qian Lv?

432
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,890
You don't need to know
what Grandmaster will do next.

433
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:12,210
You just need to complete the task
Grandmaster has assigned to you.

434
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,260
Understood.

435
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,920
From now on,
I'll surely follow Grandmaster's lead.

436
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:20,030
He wants you to pretend that
you have no idea about Yuan Shang's encounter.

437
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:24,210
He wants you to serve Shi Qian Lv
and acquire his trust.

438
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:27,170
Understood. I shall serve as Grandmaster's spy.

439
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:29,790
The moment something happens,
I'll report it to him.

440
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:32,450
He said that there's no need to contact him.

441
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:36,170
You just need to act
according to Shi Qian Lv's will.

442
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:37,960
Remember,

443
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,120
you must acquire his trust

444
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,590
so that we can use it to our advantage.

445
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:48,230
As for Yuan Shang,
Grandmaster said he could spare him.

446
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,640
But from now on,
he shall be hidden from the world.

447
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,360
If you're unable to hide him from the world,

448
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:56,980
Grandmaster will kill him on your behalf to prevent additional trouble.

449
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,820
I shall heed Grandmaster's guidance.

450
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,920
Please thank Grandmaster for saving my son.

451
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,230
Shang.

452
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,790
Shang.

453
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:15,220
 

454
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,380
Ru Ling.

455
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,830
Cang Lan.

456
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,100
You've finally returned.
I'm glad that you're back.

457
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,600
 

458
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,590
It must've been tough on you.

459
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,240
Not at all.

460
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:44,230
Ru Ling, congratulations
on absorbing the master's core.

461
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:46,500
Now, you can live here.

462
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,210
You won't need to be bullied again.

463
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:50,860
Here.

464
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:58,440
Ru Ling, was there no opportunity
for you to kill Sima Jiao

465
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,760
when you were at Three Saints Mountain?

466
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:06,470
He's too powerful, and very cautious as well.

467
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:08,540
He only ordered Ting Yan to serve him alone.

468
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,820
I couldn't get near him.

469
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,030
But Cang Lan, I discovered

470
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:18,320
that Ting Yan might have
the extreme-cold nature that Mother had mentioned before.

471
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,440
The extreme-cold nature?

472
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,330
Only the Frost Fish in the Demon Realm possesses the extreme-cold nature.

473
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:26,580
Could it be that Liao Ting Yan
is its incarnation?

474
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:29,810
This is great. Besides the Sima Clan, only those with the extreme-cold nature

475
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:31,780
can get across the Immortal-Demon Barrier.

476
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,740
But I've tried it before.

477
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,960
It's as if she forgot about her identity.

478
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,370
She couldn't remember
how to activate her extreme-cold nature.

479
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,340
If so, we can just extract her core.

480
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,710
That won't do.

481
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,880
If we do so, she will not survive.

482
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,170
Ting Yan has no idea who she is.

483
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:51,410
Cang Lan, we cannot expect people
to sacrifice themselves for our sake.

484
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:53,410
If Sima Jiao finds out
that she's from the Demon Realm,

485
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:55,210
he will kill her anyway.

486
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,990
If so, isn't it better for her
to help us and our brethren

487
00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:00,520
to return to the Demon Realm and fulfill Mother's last wish?

488
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,840
That won't do.

489
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,580
Ting Yan treats me as a true friend.

490
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,210
I mustn't betray her.

491
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:09,180
We stand a chance of returning to our hometown
as long as she's alive.

492
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,820
But Ru Ling, compared to killing Sima Jiao,

493
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,020
extracting Liao Ting Yan's core is much easier.

494
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,590
Enough.

495
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,820
Do not bring this up again.

496
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,830
I'll come up with a way.

497
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,550
Excellent.

498
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:31,300
Tell Yuan Che that Liao Ting Yan
is from the Demon Realm.

499
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,120
This way, he would think

500
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,580
that Sima Jiao killed his son
because he was persuaded

501
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,260
by that woman
from the Demon Realm to do so.

502
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:42,020
This way, there's no way Sima Jiao
can prove his innocence.

503
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,750
Yes, Sect Master.

504
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,370
An Xue.

505
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:54,860
You did an excellent job on the previous Three Saints Mountain mission.

506
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,200
What reward do you want?

507
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,750
Now, Yin Liu Nian is dead.

508
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,600
The new palace head is incapable.

509
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,400
Sect Master, I only wish to serve you again.

510
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,420
I have no other requests.

511
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,710
All right.

512
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:08,550
Thank you, Sect Master.

513
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,040
You may leave.

514
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,540
Yes, Sect Master.

515
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,110
Zhen Xu.

516
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:33,250
When do you intend
to cast Soul Cleanse on An Xue?

517
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,230
Father, Soul Cleanse is an excruciating spell.

518
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:40,340
An Xue has no idea about our grand plans.

519
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,270
She has always been loyal to us as well.

520
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:44,540
Don't you think we can...

521
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:47,680
Zhen Xu, remember this.

522
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:51,130
There's no one in this world
you can trust completely,

523
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:53,400
except for me.

524
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:58,390
Our plan must be flawless.

525
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,940
Yes, Father.

526
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:07,880
Where's Liao Ting Yan?

527
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,470
Ting Yan is still sleeping.

528
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,070
She sleeps and eats all day long.

529
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,230
She does lead a carefree life, doesn't she?

530
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,550
Let me wake her up, then.

531
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,050
Don't be nosy.

532
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,360
 Shi has already found out
that Liao Ting Yan is from the Demon Realm. 

533
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,120
Grandmaster.

534
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,760
Shi Qian Lv actually found out Ting Yan was from the Demon Realm.

535
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,230
What should we do now?

536
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,710
This is a secret.

537
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,160
How did that old fool find out?

538
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,070
Could it be that Shi Qian Lv
is still in cahoots with the Demon Realm?

539
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,840
Was that why he found out
about Ting Yan's identity?

540
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,260
Go investigate the source of the information.

541
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,860
Yes, Grandmaster.

542
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:43,400
But Grandmaster, how should we deal with Ting Yan's matters now?

543
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,110
Since the Eight Palaces want her dead,

544
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,120
we shall oblige.

545
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,820
Grandmaster, are you going to kill Ting Yan?

546
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,790
What's wrong?

547
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:59,030
- Are you reluctant to part with her?
- That's right.

548
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:02,820
Grandmaster, I'm sure you feel the same.

549
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:06,020
I'll instruct Yuan Che
to collude with Shi Qian Lv,

550
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:09,440
kill Liao Ting Yan,
and acquire Shi Qian Lv's trust.

551
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,340
But, Grandmaster...

552
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,840
Sect Master Shi.

553
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,960
Sect Master Shi!

554
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,470
- Sect Master Shi.
- Master Yuan.

555
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:20,510
Please uphold justice for Four Seasons Palace!

556
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,150
Master Yuan, what happened?

557
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,050
Today...

558
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:27,760
Today, I found Shang's body
under White Deer Cliff.

559
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,670
His body actually contained traces
of Sima Jiao's spell!

560
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,700
How could that be?

561
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,360
Master Yuan.

562
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,520
Please accept my condolences.

563
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:45,440
But why did Grandmaster do that?

564
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,630
I also found out about this just now.

565
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:50,550
Liao Ting Yan is actually a spy
from the Demon Realm.

566
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,510
I assume she tried to silence him

567
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,670
after my son found out about her identity.

568
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:57,760
Therefore, she instigated Sima Jiao
to murder my son!

569
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,720
Grandmaster has so much trust in that traitor.

570
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:05,920
If this keeps up,
Gengchen Celestial Palace will face a crisis.

571
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,470
I will never let him off!

572
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:12,070
Before this, I still had some respect for him.

573
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:16,290
I didn't expect him to treat our lives with such indifference!

574
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:18,440
He behaves in a reckless, outrageous manner.

575
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,630
I have to get my revenge!

576
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:50,260
Grandmaster. You're here.

577
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,780
You've actually come to read for once.

578
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,960
Ever since I reached the Soulshift stage,

579
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,570
my sense for the world has gotten stronger.

580
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:01,410
Now, I'm curious about
the structure of the cultivation world.

581
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:02,590
I was bored as well.

582
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:05,280
That was why I started reading.

583
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,260
What books have you read, then?

584
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,910
I've read...

585
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:15,740
I was just having a casual look.

586
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,670
Let go.

587
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:25,630
Can you promise me
that you won't be angry at me?

588
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,270
No, I cannot.

589
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,516
 

590
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,760
You see? I knew that you would be angry at me.

591
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,780
This is nothing more than something fabricated

592
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,010
by the people of Gengchen Celestial Palace.

593
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,620
If so, why don't you tell me the truth?

594
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,800
It says here that Gengchen Celestial Palace

595
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,840
isn't limited to just the places we see now.

596
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,030
There are outer sects around it,

597
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:06,040
with spaces for both cultivators and demonic cultivators.

598
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,750
Is that true?

599
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,820
That's true.

600
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:13,740
Many years ago, the leader of the Demon Realm,
Centipede, caused chaos.

601
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:16,030
The Sima Clan eradicated
the demonic cultivators

602
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:18,630
and set up a Immortal-Demon Barrier.

603
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:21,990
Since then, those from the Demon Realm
couldn't cultivate their powers

604
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:24,270
with the spiritual energy
of Gengchen Celestial Palace.

605
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:26,310
Is the Sima Clan that amazing?

606
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:28,780
It's said that the war was so brutal,

607
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,150
the battlefield stretched red
and barren for miles.

608
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:35,110
The former hills and mountains
have become barren plains.

609
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:39,380
It even says that you were raised
by Lord of Slack of the Shi Clan.

610
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,220
It says that you were rash
and you wouldn't take his advice.

611
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:45,620
He sought the help of an immortal to suppress your inner demon.

612
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:49,570
It says that your nickname,
Lord of Mercy, came from...

613
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,990
That's totally false.

614
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:00,630
This book is complete nonsense.

615
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,720
Boss, this book is too much.

616
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,360
Even I don't believe it.

617
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,230
I'm telling the truth.

618
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,910
Sect Master Shi.

619
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,510
Please reactivate the sealing array.

620
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:18,450
From now on, I'll surely follow your lead.

621
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:20,030
Master Yuan, you honor me too much.

622
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:22,450
Grandmaster is too stubborn and unyielding.

623
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:27,370
We should persuade him
to get back on the right track.

624
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:30,780
Now, the new palace head of Heaven Palace
has already assumed office.

625
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:35,340
Seems like there's no issue
in sealing him away again.

626
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,510
However...

627
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:40,840
Master Yuan, what you said before
did make a lot of sense.

628
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,840
Once we reactivate the sealing array,

629
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,190
each palace will surely suffer casualties.

630
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,510
If so...

631
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:49,190
If so, what should we do?

632
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,960
 Suggest to him that he should
take advantge of Liao Ting Yan's identity 

633
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,140
 and find a chance to seal me away. 

634
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:56,240
 Shi Qian Lv will surely be pleased
upon hearing that. 

635
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,890
Since Sima Jiao favors that spy that much,

636
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:04,360
let's use her to lure Sima Jiao
into the sealing array.

637
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,070
Even if we fail to seal him away,

638
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,990
we can keep Sima Jiao in check

639
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:11,030
as long as we capture Liao Ting Yan.

640
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,240
During the flower banquet,

641
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,840
it seems Dongyang Zhenren is her master.

642
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,850
We can use him to our advantage.

643
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:23,800
Master Yuan, that's an excellent plan.

644
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,760
All right. There's no time better than now.

645
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,440
I shall summon all palace heads

646
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,070
to discuss this matter
and make the call together.

647
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:33,230
Thank you, Sect Master Shi.

648
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,920
Dear Ting Yan,
it's been some time since we met.

649
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,990
I missed you.

650
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:57,670
It's from my master.

651
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:00,240
A festival is about to arrive in Serene Vale.

652
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,720
As it happens,
you've already left the sect with Grandmaster.

653
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:08,880
Your fellow disciples are inviting you
and Grandmaster to our celebratory feast.

654
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,150
This is great.

655
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:12,280
Grandmaster, let's attend it together.

656
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,980
I'm not going.

657
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:18,530
May I attend it, then?

658
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,840
Of course.

659
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,050
This celebratory feast is meant for you.

660
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,900
Its purpose is to kill you.

661
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:57,920

00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:07,540
 ♫ Autumn winds sigh ♫ 

664
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,650
 ♫ Moon and stars dapple the sky ♫ 

665
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:13,610
 ♫ Brushing the loneliness of bygone days ♫ 

666
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:15,550
 ♫ Candlelight flickers low ♫ 

667
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:17,540
 ♫ Shadows sway ♫ 

668
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:21,550
 ♫ Shimmering in the night ♫ 

669
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:23,590
 ♫ With a brush I draw ♫ 

670
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:25,610
 ♫ The color of light ♫ 

671
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:29,530
 ♫ To warm your frozen soul ♫ 

672
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:31,500
 ♫ Memories anchor here ♫ 

673
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,470
 ♫ Longing is engraved ♫ 

674
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:36,990
 ♫ Yet cannot be touched ♫ 

675
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:39,160
 ♫ Following ♫ 

676
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,650
 ♫ The veins of gravel ♫ 

677
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:45,540
 ♫ I turn into spirit fire ♫ 

678
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,270
 ♫ Burning away ♫ 

679
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:53,660
 ♫ All these karmic ties ♫ 

680
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,660
 ♫ To save you ♫ 

681
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,620
 ♫ To save me ♫ 

682
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:01,620
 ♫ To cross over all suffering,
I'll break through ♫ 

683
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,650
 ♫ The laws of heaven ♫ 

684
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,590
 ♫ The vortex of reincarnation ♫ 

685
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:09,630
 ♫ What of life and death? ♫ 

686
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,610
 ♫ To save you ♫ 

687
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:13,510
 ♫ To save me ♫ 

688
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:17,520
 ♫ To redeem all beings, I'll let pass ♫ 

689
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,640
 ♫ Right and wrong ♫ 

690
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,570
 ♫ Rumors and tales ♫ 

691
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:25,080
 ♫ To seize fate ♫ 

692
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:29,440
 ♫ With my own hands ♫ 

693
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,670
 ♫ For you ♫ 

694
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:33,610
 ♫ For me ♫ 

695
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:37,580
 ♫ For the healing of wounds ♫ 

696
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,700
 ♫ I'll stir the murky seas ♫ 

697
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,590
 ♫ And strive against the heavens ♫ 

698
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:45,610
 ♫ To protect the vastness ♫ 

699
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:47,650
 ♫ For you ♫ 

700
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:49,660
 ♫ For me ♫ 

701
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:53,650
 ♫ For the light of dawn ♫ 

702
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:55,590
 ♫ I'll face promises ♫ 

703
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:57,590
 ♫ Like a moth to a flame ♫ 

704
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:10,200
 ♫ And use my body to shine on even more ♫
