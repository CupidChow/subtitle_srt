 ♫ Heavens strike with thunderous wrath ♫ 

2
00:00:28,505 --> 00:00:32,559
 ♫ Mountains and rivers shatter before my eyes ♫ 

3
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:35,783
 ♫ Endless splendor
cultivated through lifetimes ♫ 

4
00:00:35,783 --> 00:00:40,324
 ♫ Turns to dust between my fingers
in an instant ♫ 

5
00:00:40,324 --> 00:00:44,220
 ♫ When the line
between good and evil is clear ♫ 

6
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,340
 ♫ Countless souls drift
into the boundless wilds ♫

00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,500
 ♫ Carrying the spirit fire forward ♫ 

8
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,580
 ♫ I defy fate ♫

 ♫ Just to remain by your side ♫ 

10

 ♫ Falling into love's abyss ♫

 ♫ Stirring waves upending a lifetime ♫

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,490
Get up, Sima Jiao.

22
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:50,800
No!

23
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,910
Sima Jiao is dead.

24
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:58,380
He's dead.

25
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:07,500
 ♫ Why must we suffer all this? ♫ 

26
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,060

 ♫ Longing runs wild in endless void ♫ 

28
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,220
 ♫ Then wish upon the stars ♫

 ♫ May this chain of enduring fate ♫ 

31
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:38,100
 ♫ Never replay heartbreak again ♫ 

32
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,730
Yan.

33
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:01,360
Seeing that you have come to see me off,

34
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,390
I can leave in peace now.

35
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,550
Sima Jiao won't die.

36
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:11,800
You can't die in peace.

37
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,870
That is not for you to decide.

38
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:23,760
Oh well, lies or truth, life or death...

39
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,900
Let them all drift away with the wind.

40
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,290
To have lived this long in defiance

41
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,130
was worth it.

42
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,620
Yan!

43
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:33,730
The blood pool is full.
The blood sacrifice is upon us!

44
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,680
We have succeeded.

45
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,880
Sima Jiao is dead.

46
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,410
No one can stop our lord
from becoming the Immortal-Demon Ruler now!

47
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:26,030
Have I entered my Soul Manor again?

48
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,760
Yes.

49
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,270
I've waited so long for you.

50
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,700
Who are you?

51
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,850
We are the same person.

52
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,320
Are you my lost memories?

53
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,150
You could say that.

54
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,350
Together, you and I make up the complete memory

55
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,580
of our time in this cultivation world.

56
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,440
 Greetings, Masters and Madams. 

57
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,660
 A snake! 

58
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:08,020
 Watch out! 

59
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,150
 It's cheered you up, hasn't it? 

60
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,830
 Don't you like it? 

61
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:22,440
 My destiny is to live a carefree life,
eating, drinking, and enjoying myself. 

62
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,790
 Jiao! 

63
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,720
 Come! 

64
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,560
 I'm doing this because I cherish you so much. 

65
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,560
 I don't want you to be harmed in the slightest. 

66
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,270
 Now, you are the one
closest to me in this world. 

67
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,080
 When I saw you cry, 

68
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,830
 I felt regret for the first time in my life. 

69
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,830
 From now on, you will not just be my boyfriend. 

70
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:47,150
 Sima Jiao, this time, 

71
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,970
 I can't wait for you to come home. 

72
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,710
I remember now.

73
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:59,520
I remember everything now.

74
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,390
How do we get out of here?

75
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,910
Sima Jiao is injured.

76
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,790
I need to save him.

77
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,460
Sima Jiao is injured?

78
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,660
Was it your doing?

79
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:18,640
The cold energy here awakened
my assassin instincts as the Frost Fish,

80
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,320
and I lost control.

81
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,350
I... I stabbed him.

82
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:27,370
How could you hurt
the one I cherished the most?

83
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:32,520
Now, what matters most is finding a way

84
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,780
to leave the Bone Pool and save him.

85
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,470
The Bone Pool is bottomless.

86
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:45,960
Before you woke,
I tried to swim out, but I failed.

87
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:51,140
Then together, we will succeed.

88
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,590
My Lord, I have slain Sima Jiao.

89
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,680
The blood of the Fengshan Clan is ready.

90
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,790
But the barrier at Yin-Yang Lake remains.

91
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,120
That means Sima Jiao isn't dead yet!

92
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,220
What?

93
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:21,030
You can't even handle Sima Jiao.

94
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,350
Had I been in command,

95
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:26,640
I would have rallied the Demonic Army

96
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,350
and personally led a march
into the Gengchen Celestial Palace.

97
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,280
My Lord, don't waste time arguing with him.

98
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,780
Feng Qi, do it!

99
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,080
Are you ready?

100
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,110
I will make every moment of death's approach

101
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:48,590
so painfully real that you will recall

102
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,990
each and every sin you ever committed.

103
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:55,140
Feng Qi, let me go!

104
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,810
Yan!

105
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,590
How dare you use me to harm him?

106
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:40,750
As expected of the assassin
I raised with my own flesh and blood.

107
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,400
Shut up!

108
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:47,160
Feng Qi, quicken the sacrifice!

109
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,560
You want to take what is mine?

110
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,960
I won't let you!

111
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,800
Liao Ting Yan, remember this!

112
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,870
I was the one who gave you form.

113
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:05,140
From now on, you will fight for me, You Chi!

114
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,570
You fool! What are you doing?

115
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:24,260
Stop her!

116
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,290
No!

117
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:40,020
My Lord!

118
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,110
What happened?

119
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:58,320
The Frost Fish has merged
with the Demon Lord's core!

120
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,680
What?

121
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,830
Doesn't that make her our new ruler?

122
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,630
What are you talking about?

123
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,930
Ridiculous. I don't want to be your ruler.

124
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,350
How is the Grandmaster?

125
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,470
How is he?

126
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,280
His spiritual power is severely depleted,

127
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,960
and he has lost too much blood.

128
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,660
I fear he cannot be saved.

129
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,510
How could that be?

130
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:36,830
The Grandmaster is gravely injured,
and Yan is missing.

131
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,540
What are we supposed to do?

132
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:45,040
Bai Zhu, you take care of the Grandmaster.

133
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,960
We will think of a plan.

134
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,230
Yes.

135
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,590
I knew that woman couldn't be trusted.

136
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,040
I wondered why she could ease.

137
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,040
Sima Jiao's pain from the Spirit Fire.

138
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,830
Turns out she didn't ease it.
She just suppressed it.

139
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,350
Now that her extreme-cold nature
has been fully awakened,

140
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,630
if she wants him dead, he'll die at any moment!

141
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,990
Ting Yan would never harm the Grandmaster.

142
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,080
At the end of the day,
she is from the Demon Race.

143
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,960
- There's no way she truly cares for him!
- You...

144
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,830
And he, foolish as ever,
used his own heart-protecting bone

145
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,590
to make her a protective artifact.

146
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,560
In the end, he left himself riddled with wounds

147
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,960
and barely able to control the Spirit Fire.

148
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,990
Could you not say
such pointless things at a time like this?

149
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:19,680
Liao Ting Yan is a Frost Fish
assassin by nature,

150
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,470
while Sima Jiao is the Spirit Fire's host.

151
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,830
The two were born enemies,

152
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,630
yet they insisted on being together.

153
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,750
Wasn't that a losing battle they were fighting?

154
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,023
He is in terrible condition.

155
00:12:28,023 --> 00:12:30,080
If you don't wake him soon,

156
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,710
he will burn himself alive!

157
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,590
With the Grandmaster unconscious, what if...

158
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,280
what if the Demon Race attacks us now?

159
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,230
What should we do?

160
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:43,440
Perhaps... I can try something.

161
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,110
Nian Jiu, the Grandmaster
once cast a protective spell on me

162
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,710
to conceal my aura as a Fengshan descendant.

163
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:52,350
Now that he is in danger,
I ask you to lift the spell

164
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,200
so I may replenish his blood
through Blood Infusion.

165
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,990
I know it may have little effect,

166
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:01,780
but this is the only way I can help him.

167
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,590
Bi An, I will perform
the Blood Infusion carefully.

168
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,990
You won't be harmed. Don't worry.

169
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,440
It doesn't matter.

170
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,400
If it can save the Grandmaster

171
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,560
and protect peace between immortals and demons,

172
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,990
my death would be worth it.

173
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:38,110
But your life is precious, too.

174
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,400
Bai Zhu is right.

175
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,920
Even if you gave all your blood
to the Grandmaster,

176
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,990
we couldn't be sure it would work.

177
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,830
Besides, if he knew,

178
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:51,930
he would never allow you
to sacrifice yourself this way.

179
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,290
Are you all right?

180
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,200
His condition has somewhat stabilized.

181
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,080
But if he doesn't wake soon,

182
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,110
it will still be very dangerous.

183
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:46,230
Still, this much improvement
means there is hope.

184
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:49,110
Bi An, thank you.

185
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:52,330
This is what I should do.

186
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,710
Dear gods, I pray to you

187
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:25,200
that the Grandmaster will wake safe and sound.

188
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,980
 I smell Fengshan blood... 

189
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:35,740
And please let Ms. Yan return safely soon.

190
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,750
 So, besides Sima Jiao, 

191
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:47,450
 another Fengshan descendant still lives. 

192
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,350
Why are you following me?

193
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,440
Do you really want me to be your ruler?

194
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,200
You have absorbed the Demon Lord's core.

195
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,470
Only you can be our ruler now.

196
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:06,630
Besides, it was you who gravely injured
the Grandmaster of the Celestial Palace.

197
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:10,200
That makes you our new ruler.

198
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,680
 Greetings, Madam! 

199
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,440
But the Grandmaster of the Celestial Palace
is only injured, not dead.

200
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,040
I heard she and that Grandmaster

201
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,230
had a murky relationship.

202
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,870
What if this is just a trick to deceive us?

203
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,160
Madam, now that Sima Jiao is gravely injured,

204
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,870
why don't we help you kill him

205
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,470
and destroy the Spirit Fire?

206
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,560
If you can kill Sima Jiao,

207
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,280
I will acknowledge you as Demon Mistress.

208
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:37,450
 I can't let them
go after Sima Jiao at a time like this. 

209
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,680
If you all go, it will draw too much attention.

210
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,870
While he is gravely injured,
I will kill him alone.

211
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:52,040
Then everything will be solved.

212
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,290
What do you say?

213
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,980
Then we shall wait here
for your triumphant return, Madam.

214
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,610
Sima Jiao!

215
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,840
This is impossible.

216
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,940
Did I really kill him?

217
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,680
Sima Jiao.

218
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,540
Wake up.

219
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:49,880
Look at me.

220
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,290
Sima Jiao.

221
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,510
Wake up and look at me.

222
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:58,310
Yan, he isn't dead.

223
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,550
Calm down.

224
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,600
Senior Sister Ting Yan,

225
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,550
everything here is to help keep
the Grandmaster's vitality steady.

226
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,790
We have been waiting for your return.

227
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:10,850
Ting Yan, only you can save him now.

228
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,650
Sima Jiao!

229
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,360
Sima Jiao!

230
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,540
No!

231
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,270
It's been hours. Why hasn't anything happened?

232
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,990
Sister Ting Yan may have fallen
into the Grandmaster's dreamscape.

233
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,470
If she cannot find the way out,

234
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:35,310
she will be trapped there until she fades away.

235
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,640
- I'll go wake her.
- No, don't!

236
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,640
If interrupted by an external force,

237
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,070
the Grandmaster's Soul Manor
will close immediately,

238
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:45,030
and the two of them will never come out again.

239
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:49,570
Ting Yan, don't give up.

240
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,600
This is the night
when the Sima clan was wiped out,

241
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,440
the beginning
of Sima Jiao's lifelong nightmare.

242
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,270
If I save him here,

243
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:10,710
he should awaken into another fate, right?

244
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,890
No!

245
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,200
You cannot take Jiao away.

246
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,200
Do you want to watch him die here?

247
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,200
As long as Jiao remains here,
he still has a chance.

248
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:27,120
If you take him away,
he will vanish without a trace.

249
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,570
Then how can I save him?

250
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,030
The Spirit Fire.

251
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,600
The Spirit Fire?

252
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,680
Only the Fengshan Spirit Fire can save him.

253
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,270
It is both the curse of our clan

254
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,750
and the thing that can save our lives.

255
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,710
If so, why haven't you acted?

256
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:48,810
He's already...

257
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,400
The fire seed is about to die out,

258
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,920
but I can't take him back
to Thunder Valley either.

259
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,960
Jiao...

260
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,030
Thunder Valley?

261
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,880
If I take him back there,

262
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,500
will the Spirit Fire be restored?

263
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,990
Grandmaster.

264
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:32,370
Ting Yan, how is he?

265
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,070
Where are you taking him?

266
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,420
Thunder Valley.

267
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,510
 It will probably take thunderbolts
to reignite the Spirit Fire. 

268
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:52,310
 But there is no tribulation to go through now. 

269
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,400
 If I want lightning, 

270
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,850
 I must defy the way of heaven myself. 

271
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,030
Look at how chaotic the Immortal
and Demon Realms have become!

272
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,810
Why haven't you intervened?

273
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,640
Sima Jiao struck down You Yan for you.

274
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,960
Why do you want his life in return?

275
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,200
You call this the way of heaven?

276
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,610
How are you worthy of people's worship?

277
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,920
I haven't even gotten to the point,

278
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,850
and you strike already?

279
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,810
Oh, I see. The Demon Lord's core is inside me.

280
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,960
You are furious that a demon

281
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:03,940
has entered the holy
Immortal Realm, aren't you?

282
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:19,470
Immortals and demons are all living beings.

283
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,400
What difference is there?

284
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,310
So what if this is a holy place?

285
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,400
I am not leaving.

286
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,750
Strike me down
with your 81 thunderbolts, I dare you!

287
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:34,570
If you don't, I will destroy
this so-called heaven that has no mercy!

288
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,940
I can't die yet.

289
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,650

317
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,270
Are you trying to burn me,
the Demon Mistress, to death?

318
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,980
As Demon Mistress,

319
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:17,470
you gave in to me quite easily.

320
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:21,510
Are you fully recovered now?

321
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:24,680
When I went into your Soul Manor earlier,

322
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:28,050
it was a wreck.

323
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,880
If you had been an ordinary man,

324
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,370
would the pain have killed you long ago?

325
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:43,070
But am I an ordinary man?

326
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:46,130
So, you're all right now?

327
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:55,990
This is all my fault.
I should never have gone to Grain Rain Vale.

328
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:59,070
I was too naive.

329
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,790
In a world like this,

330
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:03,230
how could there have been such a paradise?

331
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:06,090
How foolish I was.

332
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,270
And I nearly got you killed.

333
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:14,990
Once I clear away the filth from
both the Immortal and Demon Realms,

334
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:18,370
wherever you go will be like Grain Rain Vale.

335
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:23,230
You mean you want to unify both realms?

336
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:26,780
Did you ask the Demon Realm's ruler about that?

337
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,980
My cultivation partner is the Demon Mistress.

338
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,680
Do I really need to be worried?

339
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,090
I only stumbled into this position.

340
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,270
I have no real authority.

341
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,440
They let me be Demon Mistress

342
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,270
only because of the demon core inside me.

343
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:48,640
They obey on the surface,

344
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,710
but in truth, it all depends on how I behave.

345
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:55,680
The Demon Realm is a place
where only the strong are respected.

346
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,610
You are the only one in this world

347
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,920
who can make me yield without a fight.

348
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,780
That makes you the strongest of all.

349
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,270
The people of the Demon Realm
won't be so easily fooled.

350
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:14,650
I will sort everything out for you.

351
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:20,070
You just need to sit back and relax.

352
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:23,470
You are doing so much for me.

353
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,920
I can't just sit back and do nothing.

354
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,840
Whether in a civil war
or a war against outsiders,

355
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,360
it is always the common people who suffer most.

356
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,680
Why don't we work toward
uniting immortals and demons?

357
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,790
As for those who resist,

358
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:45,050
we can take our time dealing with them.

359
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:51,130
As you wish.

360
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:17,650
Master Yuan, what is going on?

361
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,750
It's the Grandmaster and the Grandmistress.

362
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,510
Sima Jiao is alive?

363
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:27,120
How did our ruler become their Grandmistress?

364
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,960
I told you
she couldn't destroy the Spirit Fire.

365
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,920
Now she's even consorting with Sima Jiao.

366
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,070
Do you still want
to accept her as Demon Mistress?

367
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:37,990
War is never a lasting solution.

368
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:41,120
The Grandmaster of the Celestial Palace and I
have reached an agreement.

369
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,440
He will help us resolve

370
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,510
the Demon Realm's
lack of spirit veins for cultivation.

371
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,510
Is that true?

372
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,710
That's wonderful!

373
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:53,270
For the Demon Realm,
this is an unexpected blessing!

374
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:55,540
Amazing!

375
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,600
There is one rule.

376
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,470
As long as you no longer stir up conflict
with the Immortal Realm,

377
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:04,510
you will be able to cultivate with spirit veins

378
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:06,440
just like those in the Celestial Palace.

379
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,790
There will be no more need

380
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:12,030
for twisted practices or spells
that seize people's cores.

381
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:14,470
We won't have to eat people anymore!

382
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:18,090
If anyone dares to cause trouble...

383
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:26,120
We will follow your lead, Madam.

384
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,920
Then this is the day
the Immortal-Demon War ends completely.

385
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,880
No more barriers will be raised.

386
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,120
People will move freely and coexist peacefully.

387
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,070
You must also set an example yourselves

388
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:40,550
to guide those outside the Celestial Palace.

389
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,740
 Yes, Grandmaster! 

390
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:57,500
Where has Bi An gone?

391
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:24,420
Sima Jiao, you are really hard to kill.

392
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,440
The aura of the Fengshan bloodline...

393
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,740
I've found her.

394
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,600
Bi An, I've finally found you.

395
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,630
What are you doing here?

396
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:57,220
We've been looking for you.

397
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,570
You are not Bi An.

398
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:12,640
How loyal you are.

399
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,570
Even on the brink of death,
you still try to send word.

400
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:27,030
Bai Zhu is dead?

401
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,040
Yes.

402
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,270
After Bi An went missing,

403
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:32,920
Bai Zhu and I split up to search for her.

404
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:36,230
But just now, Bai Zhu's life lamp went out.

405
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:38,120
His soul is completely gone.

406
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,070
It's my fault.
I shouldn't have let him search alone.

407
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:44,550
Though the conflicts between immortals
and demons have calmed recently,

408
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:46,550
the two realms are still in chaos.

409
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,680
Many demonic cultivators

410
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,310
are still trying to seize the cores
of the Celestial Palace disciples.

411
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:52,470
Bi An had her protective spell lifted.

412
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:56,230
Her blood aura could easily be found
by You Yan's lingering soul.

413
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,750
Judging by her sudden disappearance

414
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,200
and Bai Zhu's death,

415
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,310
I fear You Yan has already found Bi An

416
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:03,030
and intends to use her body for rebirth.

417
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:07,790
So, Bai Zhu's death was You Yan's doing?

418
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,720
I will do whatever it takes to find him

419
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,720
and avenge Bai Zhu and Bi An!

420
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,720
Those traitors of the Demon Realm

421
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,880
must be hoping for You Yan's return,

422
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,880
so they refuse to obey Ting Yan.

423
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:21,760
Even with only a wisp of soul left,

424
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,320
that filthy worm
still managed to cause such turmoil.

425
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,470
Ming Li.

426
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:29,360
Ming Li is You Yan's confidant.

427
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:33,470
If we want to find You Yan, Ming Li is the key.

428
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:35,720
As for the other troublemakers,
they are like weeds.

429
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:40,800
Rooting them out cannot be done in a day.

430
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,920
Go to the Celestial Palace and find
cultivators skilled in strategy and war,

431
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,030
preferably ones familiar with the Demon Realm.

432
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:49,150
Have Ting Yan choose those she trusts,

433
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:51,240
and leave them in the Demon Realm to serve her.

434
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,550
Now that the Immortal and Demon Realms

435
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,110
are temporarily at peace,

436
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:59,920
we can let those long-displaced disciples
of the Celestial Palace return home.

437
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,420
Yes, Grandmaster.

438
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:13,110
My Lord, word has it the Frost Fish
and Sima Jiao are in league.

439
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,920
They even want to unite
the Immortal and Demon Realms.

440
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:22,300
The demonic cultivators may obey him
out of fear for Sima Jiao's strength.

441
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,990
Though this body of the Fengshan descendant

442
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:32,240
can repair my primordial spirit,

443
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,960
I am too gravely wounded

444
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:38,720
to fully seize her body for myself just yet.

445
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,760
I must enter seclusion to heal.

446
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,110
When my primordial spirit is whole again,

447
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,840
I will reemerge.

448
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,030
But with You Chi dead,

449
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:49,030
you won't be able to appear in your true form.

450
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:51,110
When this body is spent,

451
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,670
you will revert to a disembodied soul again.

452
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:55,820
Don't be so short-sighted.

453
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:59,470
For millennia, I have descended
into the world again and again.

454
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:02,110
My purpose has never been mere survival,

455
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:04,630
but to open the Nine Nether Purgatory

456
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:08,150
and release the sealed Demonic Army.

457
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,150
When that day comes,

458
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:12,400
the Demon Realm will enter a new golden age.

459
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,880
Your wisdom is unmatched.

460
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,240
As for Liao Ting Yan,
she is not of the You clan.

461
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:21,500
She cannot hold the position
of Demon Mistress for long.

462
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,190
Here's a wisp of my demonic energy.

463
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:32,110
It can take root in human desire.

464
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:36,880
Use it to further our cause while I am away.

465
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,030
Guard the Demon Realm well
and wait for my return.

466
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:43,540
Yes, My Lord.

467
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,720
What do you want?

468
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,070
Are you here to capture me for Liao Ting Yan?

469
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,760
My father once told me

470
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,840
the Demon Lord's core can only be absorbed
by those from the You clan.

471
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,840
Yan is an outsider.

472
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,610
Why was she able to merge with it?

473
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,760
Why should I tell you?

474
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,440
You don't have to.

475
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,760
But in that case, I will take you to Sima Jiao

476
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,300
and let him ask you.

477
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,320
Preceptor, you and the former Demon Lord
once saved my clan.

478
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,110
I am not ungrateful.

479
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:40,300
But I will never let Yan come to harm.

480
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:48,280
Fine, I will tell you.

481
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,720
You are right.

482
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,800
Without outside help,

483
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,840
Liao Ting Yan could never have merged
with the demon core.

484
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,840
If you use the Chang clan's secret technique
to aid the fusion,

485
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,190
you'll exhaust your cultivation.

486
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:06,400
Moreover, she is already in Sima Jiao's pocket,

487
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,770
which makes her a traitor to the Demon Realm.

488
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,920
I advise you not to waste your strength on her,

489
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,860
or you will only end up benefiting Sima Jiao.

490
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:27,172
 

491
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,540
Master!

492
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,510
Senior Brother.

493
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:07,090
Ting Yan.

494
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,440
Are you preparing your dowry?

495
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,070
That's right.

496
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:32,920
Sima Jiao said he built me a city, Yan City,

497
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,960
so it would be easier for us to meet.

498
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,320
It spans from Mount Daiying,

499
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,840
with its autumn-colored slopes

500
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,470
and cold sands along the streams,

501
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:42,400
all the way to the Lone Peaks.

502
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,960
He gave me such a grand gift.

503
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,020
I should return the gesture.

504
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,030
After much thought,
I decided the best gift would be a proposal.

505
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:55,380
Oh, my girl has truly grown up.

506
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:01,380
That Black Serpent
probably won't stay put either.

507
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,650
What do you mean?

508
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:10,030
Didn't you appoint Mu Ni Sheng as a general?

509
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:12,150
Now Hei Nian Jiu can't stop fawning over her.

510
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:15,030
Mu Ni Sheng has strategy and vision.

511
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:18,150
She's perfect for a general.

512
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:21,320
You are clever and quick-witted.

513
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,150
Why don't you be my preceptor?

514
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:27,380
That way, Nian Jiu would be
chasing after you every day.

515
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,920
I could give it a try.

516
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,460
But it's not because
I want him around me all day.

517
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,150
Really, it's not!

518
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:41,020
All right...

519
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:55,610
I'm here for Hong Luo.

520
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:04,400
Nian Jiu, when you first took human form,

521
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,760
I told you that feelings took time to grow.

522
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,980
But I left something out.

523
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:16,720
Once those feelings are deep enough,

524
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:22,540
you must seize the moment,
or you'll lose your chance.

525
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:26,690
Good luck.

526
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,770
Hong Luo.

527
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,860
What is it?

528
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:51,550
This is Qiling nectar
I brought back from Serene Vale.

529
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,920
They say it strengthens the lungs

530
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,630
and nourishes the Seven Senses.

531
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:04,300
Maybe it will help you
remember some of your past.

532
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:07,760
I don't like sweets.

533
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,320
Hong Luo, I know
you want to turn it down again,

534
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,860
but this carries my feelings for you.

535
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:23,440
Back then, you gave me a name

536
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,840
and stirred something inside me.

537
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:30,400
Since then, I've always been drawn to you.

538
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,150
But I was newly human then.

539
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:38,240
I didn't realize you were someone who kept

540
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,110
everything hidden deep inside.

541
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:42,470
I'm sorry.

542
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:48,720
I let you bear all those burdens alone

543
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,900
and swallow so much bitterness.

544
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:59,900
This time, I want you to have
a sweet, happy life.

545
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,570
Hong Luo...

546
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:17,070
It sounds as though our past
was full of twists and turns,

547
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:20,250
almost like a storyteller's tale.

548
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:40,730
I meant to take the nectar.

549
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:19,590
Well?

550
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,630
Do you like it?

551
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:23,940
It's all right.

552
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:29,800
That's it?

553
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,090
"All right"?

554
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:36,550
Is there anything special about this city?

555
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:44,020
You've seen every object
and every scene here before.

556
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:49,510
This city is built from our memories

557
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:52,090
since the day we first met.

558
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:59,400
Now that you mention it, I do recall.

559
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:04,110
But compared to this city, Lord of Mercy,

560
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:06,470
I have a matter that concerns
both immortals and demons

561
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:09,300
to discuss with you.

562
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:13,920
Do you remember my suggestion

563
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,920
about an exchange program
between the two realms?

564
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,400
What do you think?

565
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,470
Too troublesome.

566
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:23,280
Too likely to cause problems.

567
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,880
Then why don't we start with a celebration?

568
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,720
It would lift everyone's spirits.

569
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,500
What is there to celebrate?

570
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:40,570
How about a marriage
between an immortal and a demon?

571
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:53,500
Are you proposing to me?

572
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,380
 ♫ Autumn winds sigh ♫
