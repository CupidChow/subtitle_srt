1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The wind and the moon are the most distant things.

2
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
But between them, love can be exchanged.

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Who loves me is not fated.

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The time that is hot and cold in this life.

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Even if this life is endless and I can't live it,

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I still want to be with you.

7
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The entangled life is eternal.

8
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I want to be with you forever.

9
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The entangled life is eternal.

10
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Don't hurt yourself in this body.

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I know, father.

12
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Remember not to expose your identity.

13
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Don't worry. I'm dressed to hide my identity.

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Don't be a coward.

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Now the broken mouth of the immortal demon has been repaired.

16
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It means that Si Ma Jiao has woken up.

17
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
He's awake now?

18
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So I'm worried that he'll find you.

19
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
If he starts first, you'll be in danger.

20
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yan'er, if you hear anything about Si Ma Jiao...

21
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I must find a chance to take his life.

22
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Father, you've said it many times.

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Si Ma Jiao is my enemy.

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But now the two immortal demons have just finished fighting.

25
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
He just woke up.

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
He won't find us so soon.

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You lost your memory in Tai Wei.

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You don't know how despicable Si Ma Jiao is.

29
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He's taken the position of the eight masters for the prison.

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
He's been charged with false charges.

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
He's been charged with false charges.

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Just like back in the day that our family

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
was investigating the NOT To Si Ma clan.

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
With hisauthority, the reason we lost our families

35
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,500
everything that verbalized his

36
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,500
I've been like this since I was a child.

37
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,420
Besides, now,

38
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,760
the Devil Lord is trying to catch the person who took the

39
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,060
immortal talisman and ten internal elixirs.

40
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,300
I had no choice

41
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:58,100
but to close the door and sit at home.

42
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,020
Father, no matter how powerful the Sima Jiao is,

43
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,540
you still saved me

44
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,740
under his nose.

45
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,740
That's for sacrificing my son

46
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,900
and Zheng Xu's life.

47
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,820
I'm sorry, father.

48
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,020
I've said the wrong thing.

49
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,420
You've sacrificed your life to save me.

50
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,020
I'll remember it.

51
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,020
And you, father.

52
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,220
I've become like this because of you.

53
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,420
I won't forget your kindness.

54
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,220
That's why I'm trying to make money

55
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,220
and take you away from the Demon Citadel.

56
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,420
I don't need you to take me away from the Demon Citadel.

57
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,820
I want you to kill Sima Jiao.

58
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,620
If you're capable,

59
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,420
I don't need you to take revenge.

60
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,620
Do you understand?

61
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,020
Put this on.

62
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,620
This mask can hide your smell.

63
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,420
It won't be easy for Sima Jiao to find you.

64
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,020
I'm thinking of you for your own good.

65
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,020
Since you just told me now,

66
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,420
I will marry you, son.

67
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:35,020
The night wear is a great opportunity to wash your modesty.

68
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,620
Can you not wash me?

69
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,300
Then we'll be proud of Si Ma.

70
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,820
We'll have no other choice.

71
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,580
Yan, how about this?

72
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,860
You give your father to him.

73
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,540
Maybe

74
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,420
he can give you a way out.

75
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,060
I know.

76
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,060
I'll come back soon.

77
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,340
Yuxian City

78
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,260
I've been so hungry for a whole day

79
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,740
that I didn't have any strength

80
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,820
to walk out of this Hexian city.

81
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,100
I think of revenge.

82
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,180
nicest man out there.

83
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,040
Unless Sima Jiao comes back

84
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,180
telling me

85
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,540
that he will die before me,

86
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,820
I won't be the one to die.

87
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,140
Maybe I will end up like you.

88
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,680
Hey, yu 얘,

89
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,820
did you see live-artist siblings books?

90
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:24,520
It was from X沒有人秀

91
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,500
and I wrote them down.

92
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,020
Mm.

93
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,020
We sent both of them books.

94
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,920
Nobody plants each other's thoughts.

95
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,020
Done.

96
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:39,620
Any objections?

97
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,060
I'm not as good as before.

98
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,860
But I'm still the one who takes over the body of the original owner.

99
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,260
I have to pay my respects to his father for him.

100
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,460
Besides, my father is nice to my father.

101
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,580
He even saved me.

102
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,340
I have to repay his kindness.

103
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,620
I called him father for 18 years.

104
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,860
The fake one is coming true.

105
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,860
But I really can't beat the devil, Sima Jiao.

106
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:30,860
Can you wake up?

107
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,300
I heard that you're good at collecting corpses.

108
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,420
That's why the Great Langyuan called you to Dongcheng.

109
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,100
Don't worry, Master Xiu.

110
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,180
I'm sure you'll be satisfied.

111
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:41,660
Go ahead.

112
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:42,700
Get back to work.

113
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,060
My good Hongluo.

114
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,020
You're always so annoying.

115
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:02,940
But now you're annoying,

116
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,260
you've made me a master

117
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,980
that I can't be bothered.

118
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,060
I didn't mean to do that.

119
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,140
Besides,

120
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,620
who told him to do this to me?

121
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:13,980
He's so low-skilled,

122
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,100
yet he wants to work with me?

123
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,340
He's so bad.

124
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,660
Killing a man is a small thing.

125
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,620
The key is to destroy my reputation.

126
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,940
This is a big deal.

127
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:22,700
Boss.

128
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,660
I heard that you're in trouble.

129
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,180
I've got a solution for you.

130
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,820
Can this body

131
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,020
solve this problem?

132
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,020
Yes.

133
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,180
In my opinion,

134
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,540
it may be your little appetite

135
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,100
for today's coupled dish

136
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,180
will pissed off you.

137
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,340
You always bully me.

138
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,780
Even though my g 있는es

139
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:52,700
are a little skinny,

140
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,660
they're quite calm

141
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,820
when they collect corpses.

142
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,060
I've asked them to meet you

143
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,220
from Dongcheng specially.

144
00:09:59,060 --> 00:09:59,740
Really?

145
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,300
Cola yourself, shall we?

146
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,140
It's not easy to do this.

147
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,140
I knew you couldn't do it.

148
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,860
It's not that I can't do it.

149
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,740
I need to spend some time

150
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,220
to get Miss Hong Luo out of here.

151
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,060
You really think you can get me out of here?

152
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,660
You're a wise woman.

153
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:31,780
Have a taste.

154
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,620
How much is it?

155
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,220
Eighteen pieces of stone.

156
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,700
Eighteen pieces of stone?

157
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,820
It's too expensive.

158
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,020
Why don't you go and buy it?

159
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,740
How about this?

160
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,500
If you can

161
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,740
solve the second young master's problem today,

162
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,420
I'll be the one to decide.

163
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,260
Yanzhi Group

164
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,060
will be in your favor in the future.

165
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,180
Can you

166
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,940
make it cheaper this time?

167
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,820
Joey,

168
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,980
you get Crown Duke up.

169
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,100
The lowest price is 15 yuan.

170
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,660
Fine, 15 pieces.

171
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,500
However,

172
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,500
don't spread the ground on this matter.

173
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,180
Well…

174
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,140
I don't know the scene anymore.

175
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,260
It will be a little ugly.

176
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,100
Please leave first.

177
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:35,780
Let's go.

178
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,420
Boss, let's go.

179
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,380
Can we really go in?

180
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:39,980
Go.

181
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,380
Okay.

182
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,820
I'll leave it to you.

183
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,140
The Demon Citadel

184
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,100
Master,

185
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,540
the Demon Citadel

186
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,540
is in such a bad environment.

187
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,140
Please be patient for now.

188
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,460
Let's rest in the Eastern City today.

189
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,780
We made it.

190
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,620
I made it with your

191
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,300
cultivation.

192
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,300
How is it?

193
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,700
I improved your cultivation.

194
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,380
You can use it to do this.

195
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,340
It can make you happy.

196
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,020
Isn't it good?

197
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,020
Master,

198
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,700
I want to stop the banquet.

199
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,020
I don't want to see

200
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,540
you so sad.

201
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,300
The Demon Citadel

202
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,300
What's the technique you just drew?

203
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,460
This is called Yan Wen Zi.

204
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,980
It's my signature.

205
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,300
Isn't it cute?

206
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:37,980
Ting Yan,

207
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,180
she's not dead.

208
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,300
The Demon Citadel

209
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,740
Master, how is it?

210
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,060
Why can't I feel her tracks?

211
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,700
Is it because something is covering it?

212
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,300
The Demon Citadel

213
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,580
But she's still alive.

214
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,260
We've made a deal.

215
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,820
You'll pay for this meal.

216
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,860
Of course.

217
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,540
It's 15 yuan.

218
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,580
I can't make that much

219
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,660
without your help.

220
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,100
Yeah.

221
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,820
If our boss

222
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,900
knows that we pretend not to know each other

223
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,940
and we even raise the price together,

224
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,380
I think she'll be so mad.

225
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,380
Hong Luo,

226
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,540
you never killed anyone.

227
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,660
What happened to

228
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,540
the second young master today?

229
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,220
He killed my sister at the rouge stage.

230
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,460
I just wanted to

231
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,980
give him some more oxygen

232
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,780
and make him feel better.

233
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,020
But he still had the strength to do it.

234
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,940
I was so angry that...

235
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,460
It's already a good deal for him.

236
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,220
You know?

237
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:28,700
Don't be afraid.

238
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,140
It's all settled.

239
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,980
This place is full of bad things.

240
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,980
Hexian City

241
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,620
is a nice name.

242
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,140
It's not suitable for drinking.

243
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,860
When I save enough money,

244
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,100
I'll take you and my father

245
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,620
to the Ancient Ways and Codes

246
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,780
to enjoy our lives.

247
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,700
The Ancient Ways and Codes

248
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,540
is a legendary place.

249
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,700
I've never heard anyone go there.

250
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:58,940
In my opinion,

251
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,620
it's just a trick to trick children.

252
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,140
You don't know.

253
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,180
I heard the exact news in the black market.

254
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,340
The Ancient Ways and Codes are strange.

255
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,220
But the door route is very expensive.

256
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,060
It takes two thousand mao shi.

257
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,180
Yes.

258
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,740
That's why you work so hard to make money.

259
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,300
But didn't you say

260
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,980
you're not a real master?

261
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,420
What other world did you come from?

262
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,900
Although I can't understand what you're talking about,

263
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,660
your father

264
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,820
is not your real father.

265
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,260
But he raised me for so long.

266
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,660
Besides,

267
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,460
he did save me.

268
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,220
You're like a fairy.

269
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,180
Why don't you hand over the internal order

270
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,020
and give me some wine?

271
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,420
Father.

272
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,020
Yan.

273
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,620
Go. I'll stop them.

274
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,380
No. I want to go with you.

275
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,460
Go.

276
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:24,940
Go.

277
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,180
Father.

278
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,020
You're so weak.

279
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,900
Don't force me anymore.

280
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,540
I've lost my real son-in-law.

281
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,620
I can't lose you again.

282
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,660
Since then,

283
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,060
his legs have been broken.

284
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,940
I can't abandon him.

285
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,380
In that case,

286
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,020
I'd better take this opportunity to do it well.

287
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,860
I'll introduce you

288
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,980
to our Yanzhi Terrace.

289
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,660
How about being a guard

290
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,460
like Feng Qi?

291
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,060
You'll have a good time every month.

292
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,860
Then you'll have a better life.

293
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,340
It's so nice to have you as a friend.

294
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,940
Who are you?

295
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,100
When my boss picked me up,

296
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,420
I was so hurt.

297
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,300
I didn't know where I was from

298
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,500
and who my parents were.

299
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,660
But I'm content

300
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,220
to be with you.

301
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,300
I don't know who you're going to support.

302
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,100
It's so nice to have you.

303
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:30,940
Yan.

304
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,540
How many years have you been with me?

305
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,340
It's been

306
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,300
four hundred years.

307
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,700
It's time

308
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,860
to set up your own family.

309
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,500
It's better to be a man.

310
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,460
Although this place is small,

311
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,740
it can be your starting point.

312
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,380
Master.

313
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,260
I've never thought about that.

314
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,740
I'm willing to be with you forever.

315
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,660
It's not up to you.

316
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,780
Go and take down this city.

317
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,660
I'll tell him in my way.

318
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,700
I'm here to find him.

319
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,260
In this way,

320
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,460
it's a good thing.

321
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,340
It's convenient for us to find Ting Yan.

322
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,380
We can also provide shelter

323
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,660
for the refugees in the late mansion.

324
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,700
Master.

325
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,460
You're so wise.

326
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,940
The supply of the demon lord

327
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,940
has changed a lot this year.

328
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,820
The demon lord has no power.

329
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,980
We can only listen to his orders.

330
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,460
What's going on outside?

331
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,300
Master.

332
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,020
Something's wrong.

333
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,540
Two people who don't know the bottom line

334
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,780
suddenly broke into the City Hall

335
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,460
and subdued all of us.

336
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,260
You can't beat two people.

337
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,740
Who's so arrogant?

338
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,540
Show me.

339
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,140
Hand over the Eastern City.

340
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,660
We'll deal with your demon lord for you.

341
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,260
Let my brothers go.

342
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,220
I'll think about it.

343
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,780
Don't get mad at us all day.

344
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:48,980
How is it?

345
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,740
How's it going?

346
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:03,980
Master,

347
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,460
I've made up my mind.

348
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,740
There's no one in the Eastern City.

349
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:08,980
You can take charge of the situation.

350
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,260
You decide.

351
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,100
You can leave.

352
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,300
I'm

353
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,140
a very open-minded person.

354
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,020
I'm willing to stay.

355
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,460
From now on, we're brothers.

356
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,460
If you don't want to stay,

357
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,380
you can leave right now.

358
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:45,900
I'm not leaving.

359
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,940
I, Niu San,

360
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,100
am willing to follow the new City Leader

361
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,460
and follow him everywhere.

362
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,180
I am willing to follow the new City Leader

363
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,940
and follow him everywhere.

364
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,580
Enough.

365
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,260
You may go to rest.

366
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,700
Yes, City Leader.

367
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,540
What's going on?

368
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,460
What's going on?

369
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,060
City Leader,

370
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,380
are they not well-behaved?

371
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,380
I'll change another one for you.

372
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,900
That's not what I mean.

373
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:22,860
Niu San,

374
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,940
you are quite strange.

375
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,300
Tell me,

376
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,740
why do you come back to me so happily?

377
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:31,780
City Leader,

378
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,460
we demons have always admired the strong.

379
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,780
No matter what your background is,

380
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,980
as long as you can fight, you should be the boss.

381
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:38,820
Brother,

382
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,660
I've been meaning to say something for a long time.

383
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,460
Although we, the Demon Regions, don't have any small rules,

384
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:48,340
we must have the rules.

385
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,860
City Leader is here.

386
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,300
You are just a follower.

387
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,020
How can you be so arrogant?

388
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,540
Shut up!

389
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:55,700
Niu San,

390
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,780
don't you want to die?

391
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,500
I'm not dying.

392
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,820
I'm not dying.

393
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,820
I'm not dying.

394
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,820
I'm not dying.

395
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,780
I'm not dying.

396
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,780
I'm not dying.

397
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,780
I'm not dying.

398
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,580
I'm not dying.

399
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,700
I'm not dying.

400
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,740
I'm not dying.

401
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:15,980
City Leader Dong,

402
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,180
how do I act in accordance with the rules?

403
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,420
Master,

404
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,660
don't...

405
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,380
Don't...

406
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,620
Don't make a scene with me.

407
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,940
Greetings, Master.

408
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:31,660
Niu San,

409
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,700
did you do the task I asked you to do?

410
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,460
Hurry up.

411
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,780
You can't go that way.

412
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,380
Look at your attitude

413
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,900
when you first come.

414
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,460
It's a taste of properly acting in line.

415
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,540
Don't break my trust.

416
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,100
replace me with a graduate of uB созд

417
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:55,820
like you today.

418
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:57,940
I think

419
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,860
we can assesin a once in a while.

420
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,060
fighting chastity

421
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,460
makes everyone happy.

422
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,460
is too unkind.

423
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,940
If you want to see him at once,

424
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,220
you must defeat a few bigger cities as soon as possible.

425
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,740
It seems that your coldness

426
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,700
hasn't recovered yet.

427
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:37,860
Father,

428
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,380
the recovery process is really painful.

429
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,660
Is there no other choice?

430
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,820
To kill Sima Jiao,

431
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,460
you have to use your coldness

432
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,980
to cool down the coldness.

433
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:55,620
Since you can't do this,

434
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,820
I'll have to wash your mouth

435
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,980
to stimulate your coldness.

436
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:02,700
Father.

437
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,300
Father.

438
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,660
Yan,

439
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,340
I'm doing this for your own good.

440
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,620
Don't blame me for being cruel.

441
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,660
We must kill Sima Jiao and avenge him.

442
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:33,980
Father.

443
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,260
But I don't hate you.

444
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,260
I can't be with you.

445
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,180
That's because you lost your memory.

446
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,420
Then why don't you help me recover my memory?

447
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,260
Eighteen years ago,

448
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,540
I lost my son.

449
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,740
You lost your brother.

450
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,340
The reason why I don't help you recover your memory

451
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,900
is because I don't want...

452
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,020
I don't want you to remember the painful past.

453
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:02,580
Father.

454
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,700
Since you've forgotten,

455
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,580
we should live a better life

456
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,260
and cherish our remaining lives.

457
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,620
What's there to cherish

458
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,940
in such a miserable life?

459
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:20,380
Your brother died for you.

460
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,180
Do you still want to live here

461
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,860
as a good dog?

462
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,900
Father, please don't be angry.

463
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,020
I've forgotten my brother's life-saving grace.

464
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,460
I got the news that

465
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,820
Sima Jiao had arrived at the Demon Citadel a few days ago.

466
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,860
He'll be here soon.

467
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,860
You just need to rest in peace.

468
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,100
Sima Jiao is coming soon.

469
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,940
I haven't saved enough money to go to Gu Yu's house.

470
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,980
It's not good to live a good life.

471
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,660
You need to take the revenge.

472
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,340
Sima Jiao must be a gentle person.

473
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,860
I'm not as good as him.

474
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:51,900
Mother,

475
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,380
I'm here to pay my respects.

476
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,900
I've changed my name to Bi'an.

477
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,100
I've changed my name to Bi'an.

478
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,420
I won't let those

479
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,980
who want to use my blood

480
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,380
to find my whereabouts.

481
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,700
Mother, do you know

482
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,900
that the Grand Master has been in a bad condition recently?

483
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,140
Tomorrow,

484
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:19,580
I'll set out to find the Grand Master and Sister Yan.

485
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,140
I hope everything goes well.

486
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,020
I also hope that

487
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,500
they can be as happy as you said.

488
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,020
I hope that

489
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,580
Mother,

490
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,660
the Demon Citadel is in danger.

491
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,620
I can't chat with you anymore.

492
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,100
When I find Sister Yan and Grand Master,

493
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,740
I'll come to pay my respects to you.

494
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,980
Come on, drink.

495
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,460
Young Master, I'll feed you.

496
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,180
Drink, drink, drink.

497
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,580
Come on, drink.

498
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,180
Come on, Master.

499
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,180
Master, it's been a long time.

500
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,460
Drink.

501
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:13,780
Come on.

502
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,500
Another cup.

503
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,900
Your Majesty, why are you defending the court again?

504
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,020
Defending what?

505
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,220
Those old guys

506
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,700
complained that I

507
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,420
built a palace and worked hard to earn money.

508
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,500
They even criticized that I didn't take the throne.

509
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:46,820
Besides,

510
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,460
those three people

511
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,860
are all the same.

512
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,100
They're all the same.

513
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,180
They're all the same.

514
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,180
They're all the same.

515
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,180
They're all the same.

516
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,180
They're all the same.

517
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,180
They're all the same.

518
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,180
They're all the same.

519
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,820
The four horses and the sedan have been merged into two elements.

520
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,700
Why should we suffer?

521
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,180
Your Majesty, you don't know.

522
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,700
I found an ancient secret weapon recently.

523
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,700
The Heaven Lock.

524
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,500
As long as I find that fish,

525
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,100
I'll turn it into a snack and put it on the lock.

526
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,460
Then I can kill the fish.

527
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,060
I'm so angry when I get this fish.

528
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,180
How much effort did I put into it?

529
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,300
How much magic did I waste on it?

530
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,100
I turned this fish

531
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:29,220
with extreme coldness into a human.

532
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,300
But what happened?

533
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,500
Do you know if it's alive

534
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:38,220
or dead now?

535
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:38,620
Your Majesty.

536
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,620
Mingli.

537
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:43,420
You've served me for so long.

538
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,100
You still don't know me.

539
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,620
I

540
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,540
have no ability to destroy the Heaven and Earth

541
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:59,620
and I have no ambition to restore the Demon Clan.

542
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:04,140
I just want to rely on the honor of the descendants of the You family.

543
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,140
I'm so lazy to die in this Demon Palace.

544
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:12,740
So please don't force me anymore.

545
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,740
You Chi, you useless man.

546
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,540
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

547
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:30,340
If the Demon Lord is really in danger,

548
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,140
please take action.

549
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,140
How about we save the Demon Lord?

550
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:36,740
No.

551
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:41,340
When the late Demon Lord comes back from the trip,

552
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,140
you still need to take the body of You Chi as a weapon

553
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,340
and take the soul of the God.

554
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,180
You can't let You Chi

555
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,940
die in the hands of the Demon Lord.

556
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,660
You can't let anything happen to You Chi.

557
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,060
I didn't think it through.

558
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,860
The urgent thing is to find Liao Tingyan as soon as possible.

559
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,860
Did he get any news?

560
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,060
Our people

561
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:08,860
have been looking for people who came from the late mansion.

562
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,660
I got news today.

563
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,060
It seems that the southeast

564
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:16,540
saw some traces of extreme coldness.

565
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,260
But the traces are weak.

566
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,660
I don't know if it's the cold rain.

567
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,060
Isn't that place Hexian and Dongcheng?

568
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,660
Send someone to look for it.

569
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,060
Don't let them go even if they're wrong.

570
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,060
Yes.

571
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,260
Grand Master.

572
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,060
Grand Master.

573
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,660
Grand Master.

574
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,660
Dongcheng has ordered not to treat the late man.

575
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,060
But this time,

576
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:47,140
he just took some people from the late mansion.

577
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:47,740
I...

578
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,740
I just followed the order.

579
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,060
The late mansion

580
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,260
Why did you search for the late man?

581
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,860
The superior ordered us to search for the late man.

582
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,860
Take them back to the Demon Palace.

583
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,260
I don't know what's left.

584
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,860
Where to search?

585
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,860
We're divided into two ways.

586
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,460
We'll search Dongcheng and Hexian.

587
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,860
Any late man

588
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,060
may be Tingyan who is here.

589
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,660
I can't let him have any chance of getting in danger.

590
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:22,300
Keep the Double-Et GET beans dirty.

591
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:28,900
I've got this.

592
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,740
It seems we've had a bad fight.

593
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,400
Both High Master blank

594
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,760
and Whenever Good Drinking is not corresponding at all.

595
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,840
Sometimes,

596
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,980
it can only be done alliance for them.

597
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:17,840
Since I have saved 2,000

598
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,160
traces of devil,

599
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:19,920
By the way,

600
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,360
No matter he had holes,

601
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,080
no one knows

602
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,720
whether or not he made them

603
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,900
but he can't deploy a weapon in prison.

604
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,640
That's the reason?

605
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,180
The ave to lie down

606
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,680
to bend down

607
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,800
is easy for you to get hurt.

608
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,300
Explain that

609
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,360

610
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,700

00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,960
We need to defend her

612
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,040
as she did.

613
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:53,200

Si fazla

621
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,760
I'll kill you if you keep following me.

622
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,920
Are you a deity?

623
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,240
Can I ask you about two people?

624
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,880
Do you know

625
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,680
where the Taoist priest and his Taoist priest, Liao Tingyan, are?

626
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,600
You are the blood of Mount Feng.

627
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,160
Who are you?

628
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,240
I'm the Taoist priest of the Taoist priest.

629
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,760
I'm the Taoist priest of the Taoist priest.

630
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,480
I'm the Taoist priest of the Taoist priest.

631
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,760
You are the blood of the Taoist priest.

632
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,600
You are the Taoist priest?

633
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,840
You are really the Taoist priest?

634
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,160
I'm Zhou Yueqing,

635
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,600
the daughter of Zhou Qing'er.

636
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,520
You and Sister Yan saved me.

637
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,760
Why are you in the Demon Citadel?

638
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,440
The Immortal's Mansion was in chaos back then.

639
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,440
My mother and I

640
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,480
were in the chaos

641
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,320
and lived in the Demon Citadel.

642
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,680
My mother died a few days ago.

643
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,120
I was lonely and lonely.

644
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,440
So I wanted to find my grandmaster and Sister Yan.

645
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,960
I didn't expect to meet you here.

646
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,880
I asked my grandmaster to allow me to follow you.

647
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,600
I can do anything.

648
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,320
My mother said that Sister Yan liked to play.

649
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,440
When you are busy,

650
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,720
I can play with Sister Yan.

651
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,280
She does like to play.

652
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,440
The Demon Citadel

653
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,320
With this protective barrier,

654
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,720
no one will recognize you

655
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,800
as the descendant of Fengshan.

656
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,960
Go to the City Leader of Dongcheng.

657
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,120
He will comfort you.

658
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,600
Thank you, Grandmaster.

659
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,400
What about you?

660
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,440
The Demon Citadel

661
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,000
Grandmaster,

662
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,960
we have taken four cities in the Demon Citadel.

663
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,920
Will we continue tomorrow?

664
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,040
Of course.

665
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,840
The City of Hexian

666
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,360
is the turning point of the southeast.

667
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,880
I understand.

668
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,040
That's why

669
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,720
there should be

670
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,720
many people from the Immortal's Mansion

671
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,520
hiding in the City of Hexian.

672
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,360
I'll inform them tomorrow.

673
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,040
We'll set off tomorrow.

674
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,560
Make sure to make a good plan.

675
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,280
Of course.

676
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,560
But Grandmaster,

677
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,000
you said

678
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,240
we have taken so many cities.

679
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,600
Why is there still no news from Ting Yan?

680
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,560
Maybe he's involved in something.

681
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,560
If he doesn't show up,

682
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,320
I'll take the post of the Demon Citadel

683
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,960
and let the whole Demon Clan find him for me.

684
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,840
He Lu,

685
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:22,880

686
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,600
Kyamur!

687
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,600

You use yourself to make them EPIC,

689
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,520

690
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,200
and all the demon generals.

691
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,360
Open the gate.

The one who attacked the city

706
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,240
is a little white face.

707
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,440
