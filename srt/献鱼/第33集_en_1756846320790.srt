Episode 15

5
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So there is an entrance to the Jiuyou Lianyu

6
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
in the Mount Hu.

7
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Youyan came to the Kingdom of Hu

8
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
to release the demon generals

9
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
so that he can help him to control the cultivation of the formation

10
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
in the East Mountain.

11
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You kept it from me for so long.

12
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You said you didn't recover

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and you didn't miss the big thing.

14
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Before I came to the mortal world,

15
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I tried to

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
move my hands and feet

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
on the face of the King

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
who has been passed down for generations.

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Once I got used to it,

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
my body and soul would be complete

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
and I could hold the memories of the past life.

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You arranged it well.

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So you came here specially

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
to completely drown Youyan.

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But why do you also want to open the Jiuyou Lianyu?

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Youyan is hard to completely eliminate.

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
At this point,

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
we can only open the Jiuyou Lianyu.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Seal the Jiuyou Lianyu

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
so that he can never return to the Three Realms.

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I understand.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You want to save the Jiuyou Lianyu.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The Kingdom of Hu

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
is just a small country in the mortal world.

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The mountainous area here

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
is not as capable as this.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The Kingdom of Hu was called

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Mount Feng a thousand years ago.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
This is the origin of the Mount Feng clan.

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
After the immortal of Mount Feng

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
suppressed Youyan,

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
the key to the opening of the mountain

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
was integrated into the blood of the King of the Kingdom of Hu.

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You are just a mortal now.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
How can you fight with Youyan?

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
That's all a later story.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Since Youyan wants to live in the city of Nanyan,

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
we can then use Nanyan

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
to lure Youyan out.

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I have sent Chen Tang and Nian Zui to investigate.

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
In Nanyan's dungeon,

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
there are many bones of the same man and woman.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And the death of the four noble ladies

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
is also done by Youyan.

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
In order to be the emperor,

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Duke of Nanyan created the chaos of the Yunhe Empire

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and the drought.

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
He even killed the innocent.

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Now he has nothing to gain

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
and his daughter is dead.

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You stopped your father from being at home.

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He will soon be unable to hold back.

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If you give him another gap,

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
his ambition will be clear.

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I will help you open this gap.

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
No.

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Our wedding is wasted

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
here.

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Whether it is to visit the mountain

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
or to lure Youyan,

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
we all need to make progress.

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Moreover,

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I don't know how the evil spirit in my body

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
will develop.

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
When the devil is in the real state,

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I can only die with him.

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
If the four horses know about this,

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I will be in a very bad situation.

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I will definitely disrupt his plan to eliminate Youyan.

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What are you thinking?

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I am thinking

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I have been waiting for this moment for too long.

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I don't want to wait anymore.

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Let's really get married this time.

85
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Okay.

86
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I am sorry.

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I just said that we should be honest.

88
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I have made a mistake.

89
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
But at least

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I can leave more beautiful memories for you.

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The court will open a food store

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
to save the common people in various places.

93
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The local authorities also need to

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
take care of the elderly

95
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
to prevent other disasters from happening.

96
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The country is in a bad situation.

97
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Please do not rent this year.

98
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Your Majesty is wise.

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I order to confer Madam Yan

100
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
as the empress.

101
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
She will die.

102
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
How can she be the empress?

103
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Your Majesty, think twice.

104
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The death of the late lady

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Madam Yan is not fully relieved yet.

106
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
How can she be the empress?

107
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

108
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Your Majesty, think twice.

109
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Your Majesty, think twice.

110
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I have found out

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
the real murderer of the late lady.

112
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It is not Madam Yan.

113
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
After the ceremony

114
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I will tell you the truth.

115
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
My daughter is still in the dead body.

116
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
That dead witch

117
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
is so anxious to take the life of the demon.

118
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Please do not be angry, Your Majesty.

119
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Madam Yan has been getting more and more fragile recently.

120
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Her pulse is also very weak.

121
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I think her demon power is far from her.

122
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
If we can do it now

123
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
it will be a good opportunity.

124
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Is this true?

125
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Who are you?

126
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It does not matter.

127
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
This is a master of the Zhuwo.

128
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
This is Yi Huo, the imperial doctor.

129
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
He is right.

130
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It seems that Liao Ting Yan

131
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
has really lost most of his cultivation.

132
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
He can no longer compete with me.

133
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
My Lord

134
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
this is the best time to take Sima Jiao.

135
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
If he can defeat the mountain after he becomes a man

136
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
then he will have the imperial jade seal

137
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
and become the real emperor of the country.

138
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
If you are soft-hearted

139
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
you will be helpless.

140
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Sima Jiao

141
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
you are so muddled.

142
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Do not blame me for not giving you face.

143
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Master

144
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
please help me.

145
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
My Lord, do not worry.

146
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
At that time

147
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
you just need to take your position of the supreme ruler.

148
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I will help you to achieve your goal.

149
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
After the task is done

150
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I hope you can take the jade seal.

151
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Your Majesty

152
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
the witch of Nan Yan Hou and her

153
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
all believed in the words of Madam Yan

154
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
who suffered from her cultivation.

155
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Everything is done according to your plan.

156
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
In this case

157
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
we will wait for the ceremony

158
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
of the defeat of the mountain after the wedding.

159
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Yushi

160
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I am here.

161
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Madam

162
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Madam

163
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
can you hear me? Madam

164
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The dream is getting more and more strange.

165
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It is just a memory of the present.

166
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
All of this is

167
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
the day I raised my soul with blood.

168
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The day I was born

169
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
will I not only die

170
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
but also leave this world

171
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
when I completely suppress the demon elixir?

172
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Madam

173
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
the wedding process you have ordered

174
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
has been arranged by the following people.

175
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
OK

176
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The wedding will be more interesting

177
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
when it is more lively.

178
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Madam

179
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I am going to the wedding.

180
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I will go to the wedding.

181
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
OK

182
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Madam

183
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I will go to the wedding.

184
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
OK

185
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Madam

186
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Madam

187
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I will go to the wedding.

188
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Madam

189
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I will go to the wedding.

190
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Madam

191
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I will go to the wedding.

192
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Madam

193
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
My wife

194
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Madam

195
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You see

196
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
this too

197
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
is it true?

198
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Let them do it all

199
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Let them think

200
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
it is really true

201
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Isn't that right?

202
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The sewage bill is worth all.

203
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Madam

204
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Madam

205
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Please

206
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Madam

207
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm afraid that the day you seal the oil seal,

208
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,000
the demon elixir in my body will also be out of control.

209
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,400
At that time,

210
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,480
I will burn myself

211
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,480
to help you eliminate the oil seal.

212
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,840
Before I disappear,

213
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,280
I must leave more experience

214
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,920
to make you less lonely in the future.

215
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,720
Before I leave more experience

216
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,840
to make you less lonely in the future.

217
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,120
When the smoke內 bitter

218
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,760
Pack it,

219
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,040
but the wind is falling from within the elimination 경

220
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,120
I got this.

221
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,520
Abracadabra

222
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,360
That's it.

223
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,840
The rain falls like a sword in the sky.

224
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,680
The wind and the moon are in the distance.

225
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,440
But love can be changed between them.

226
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,400
Who can love without a wish?

227
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,640
The hot and cold love will last for a lifetime.

228
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,840
Even if the world is not as it was before,

229
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,880
I will stay with you.

230
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,320
We will never change.

231
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,160
Love you, our soy milk is overflowing.

232
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,160
conditional love

233
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,960
Over these dunes

234
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,640
The appointment automatically

235
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,760
hurry to finish

236
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,000
I mean meeting you

237
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,720
When there are a lot of figures

238
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,280
When there is a thousand eeries

239
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,480
I'm sorry.

240
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,480
I'm sorry.

241
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,480
I'm sorry.

242
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,480
I'm sorry.

243
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,480
I'm sorry.

244
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,480
I'm sorry.

245
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,480
I'm sorry.

246
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,480
I'm sorry.

247
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,480
I'm sorry.

248
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,480
I'm sorry.

249
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,480
I'm sorry.

250
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,480
I'm sorry.

251
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,480
I'm sorry.

252
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,480
I'm sorry.

253
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,480
I'm sorry.

254
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,480
I'm sorry.

255
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,480
I'm sorry.

256
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,480
I'm sorry.

257
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,480
I'm sorry.

258
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,480
I'm sorry.

259
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,480
I'm sorry.

260
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,480
I'm sorry.

261
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,480
I'm sorry.

262
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,480
I'm sorry.

263
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,480
I'm sorry.

264
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,480
I'm sorry.

265
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,480
I'm sorry.

266
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,480
I'm sorry.

267
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,480
I'm sorry.

268
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,380
I was once praised for not attaining rangQL value.

269
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,780
If today was such a grand event,

270
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,080
they must be holding hands.

271
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,480
Today's wedding,

272
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,480
I've always wanted to give it to you.

273
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,480
I have a gift for you.

274
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,480
Jiajiao,

275
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,480
what we must do today is to exchange rings.

276
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,480
This is the couple ring you gave me.

277
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,480
Now it should be called the wedding ring.

278
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:58,480
In our family,

279
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,480
the wedding ring means that the two of us are a pair.

280
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,480
We will be together forever.

281
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,480
Even if we die,

282
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,480
even if we die,

283
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,480
we can't let the two of us be separated.

284
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,480
The wedding ring

285
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,480
will be the wedding ring.

286
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,480
I will give it to you.

287
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,480
Jiajiao,

288
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:48,480
I will give it to you.

289
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:54,480
We will be together forever.

290
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,480
What are you thinking about?

291
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,480
I'm thinking

292
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,480
Spring and summer are short.

293
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,480
It's better to exchange.

294
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,480
I will give it to you.

295
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,480
The ring is gone.

296
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,480
Welcome, Your Majesty.

297
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:36,480
Please come to the wedding.

298
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,480
I'm here to welcome Your Majesty.

299
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,480
Please come to the wedding.

300
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,480
I'm here to welcome Your Majesty.

301
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:56,480
Please come to the wedding.

302
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,480
I'm here to welcome Your Majesty.

303
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:06,480
I'm here to welcome Your Majesty.

304
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:12,480
Your Majesty, they are here.

305
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,480
Protect the emperor!

306
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,480
Your Majesty,

307
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,480
you are not a good person.

308
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,480
You should save your strength.

309
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,480
You are so thoughtful.

310
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,480
You ambushed a chess piece.

311
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:33,180
The late king promoted you as the

312
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,480
emperor.

313
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,480
I'm so happy to be back.

314
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,480
You know the truth.

315
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,480
Please make a seal on the edict.

316
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,480
You can take it.

317
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:06,480
Where is the seal?

318
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,480
Come on.

319
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,480
Kill the emperor.

320
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,480
You promised me.

321
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,480
You will not kill the emperor.

322
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,480
Save him?

323
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,480
Then I will protect him.

324
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,480
Nanyan duke, you colluded with the demon clan

325
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,480
to kill the young emperor and make a big trouble.

326
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,480
You even lied to the empress.

327
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,480
You are so evil.

328
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,480
General, don't be fooled by his words.

329
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,480
I'm sorry for hiding the truth.

330
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:22,480
But he killed my family.

331
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,480
You have a plan for today.

332
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,480
Guards, take Nanyan duke.

333
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,480
Yes.

334
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,480
Who dares?

335
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,480
I'm the emperor of the country.

336
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,480
High man, help me kill the rebels.

337
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,480
I'm so proud of you.

338
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,480
I have the imperial seal.

339
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,480
I have to use my strength.

340
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:06,480
Nanyan duke, don't you know you are doing evil things in Zhuzhou?

341
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,480
Your daughter's death is also the death of your so-called master.

342
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,480
Nonsense.

343
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,480
Liao Tingye killed my daughter.

344
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,480
My lord, the death of those who killed the child

345
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,480
and the death of the concubines are the same.

346
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,480
How is it possible?

347
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,480
The master is a deity.

348
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,480
How could it be?

349
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,480
The way you look now is the same as before.

350
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,480
You should be lucky.

351
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,480
You are here.

352
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,480
You have no third level cultivation.

353
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:58,480
Now, Mu Yicheng and Zhuang Yan have no way to go back.

354
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,480
Tingye.

355
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,480
Tingye.

356
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,480
Sima Jiao.

357
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,480
Sima Jiao.

358
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,480
Your Majesty.

359
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,480
You can't die.

360
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,480
Wake up.

361
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,480
Sima Jiao, you...

362
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,480
Wake up.

363
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,480
Get up.

364
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,480
Sima Jiao.

365
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,480
Hold on.

366
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,480
Hold on.

367
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,480
Hold on.

368
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,480
I have lost you once.

369
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,480
Hold on.

370
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,480
Don't die.

371
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,480
Don't worry.

372
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,480
You can't die.

373
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,480
No.

374
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,480
No.

375
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,480
No.

376
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,480
Your Majesty.

377
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,480
Your Majesty, you are not in your right mind.

378
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,480
Sima Jiao.

379
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,480
Sima Jiao.

380
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,480
Sima Jiao.

381
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,480
Sima Jiao.

382
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,480
Sima Jiao.

383
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,480
I will die.

384
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,480
Sima Jiao.

385
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,480
Demons.

386
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,760
I will take you away from this place.

387
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,360
Demon Realm,

388
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,880
Immortal Realm,

389
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,320
and the mortal world

390
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,760
will all be your slaughterhouse.

391
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,640
Stop!

392
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,680
The Jiuyou Lianyu is the best place for the evil aura.

393
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,880
Since you don't want to give up your cultivation,

394
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,800
then become my puppet.

395
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,120
Even if you become my puppet,

396
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,440
I will kill you.

397
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,360
I will die for the heaven.

398
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,880
I will die for the heaven.

399
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,440
The Jiuyou Lianyu is the best place for the evil aura.

400
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,160
I will kill you.

401
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,400
Youyan.

402
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,720
Aren't you dead?

403
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,000
Why do you still have the spirit fire?

404
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,240
I re-ignited a bunch of spirit fire

405
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,160
in the place where the Fengshan Clan was established.

406
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,360
What's the big deal about it?

407
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,200
Look carefully.

408
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,400
This is the fire you ignited for me.

409
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,600
What's going on?

410
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,720
Where is my demon general?

411
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,440
Youyan.

412
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,720
Didn't you always want to

413
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,200
defeat your demon army?

414
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,120
I will fulfill your dream of

415
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,360
the Spring and Autumn of a thousand years.

416
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,680
Youyan has decided

417
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,520
to open the mountain when he gets the jade seal.

418
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,680
But he doesn't know

419
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,800
that I am the key.

420
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,360
The king of the Huguo

421
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,280
can only become a real king

422
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,160
after he has traveled the mountain.

423
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,120
He can be the key to open the mountain

424
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,000
and enter the Jiuyou Lianyu.

425
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,120
The jade seal is not the key to open the mountain.

426
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,720
You deliberately led me to the mountain

427
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,280
and let me enter the mountain on purpose.

428
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,920
Byao.

429
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,840
Bring me here.

430
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,080
Do you dare to

431
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,200
challenge me?

432
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,840
I don't dare to.

433
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,800
Let's help each other then!

434
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,040
I want to be starved by you!

435
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,240
For sure!

436
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,560
I...

437
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,480
Luckily,

438
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,560
we all won.

439
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,080
We all won.

440
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,120
Now you can tell me

441
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,640
how you dealt with Youyan

442
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,040
as a mortal.

443
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,520
Youyan has absorbed

444
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,960
the blood of many boys and girls.

445
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,160
I'm afraid I'm not her match.

446
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,040
As long as I can

447
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,440
re-ignite a fire in the mountain,

448
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,360
we can defeat Bi'an.

449
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,560
Where did the fire come from?

450
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,200
Do you remember

451
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,840
the new fire in Taipei Mountain?

452
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,600
The fire that made you

453
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,760
fall down quickly after you were integrated.

454
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,760
Yes.

455
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,880
After the integration,

456
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,240
the last

457
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,880
Sama clan's blood was used to refine.

458
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,640
The fire in your body

459
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,920
has been ignited.

460
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,120
After the life-death thunder,

461
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,640
it will become

462
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,160
a new

463
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,080
fire that continues to grow.

464
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,040
But you've died once.

465
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,240
If you fail to

466
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,280
survive the life-death thunder,

467
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,120
are you sure?

468
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,200
No.

469
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,040
I'm just waiting for you.

470
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,120
Tianye,

471
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,520
go after Youyan.

472
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,280
Otherwise, it's too late.

473
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,600
Master, I'm here.

474
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,520
Go.

475
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:44,600
Tianye.

476
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,560
Are you alright?

477
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:05,080
What's wrong, Tianye?

478
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,120
Why is it like this?

479
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,120
It seems to be true.

480
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,120
What is true?

481
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,120
Maybe the mission I came to this world

482
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,120
is already complete.

483
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,120
What?

484
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,120
Now,

485
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,120
it's time to leave.

486
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,120
No.

487
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,120
I don't want to leave.

488
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,120
We just started.

489
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,120
I won't let you leave.

490
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,120
But this time,

491
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,120
I'm afraid I really have to say goodbye.

492
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,120
No.

493
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,120
As long as you are still in these three realms,

494
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,120
no matter how far I go,

495
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,120
I will find you back.

496
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,120
Do you know that there is another world

497
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,120
outside the three realms?

498
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,120
Another world?

499
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,120
In the world I came to,

500
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,120
the people I love

501
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,120
have only been together for decades.

502
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,120
And you and I have been apart for three lives.

503
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,120
All these years, I have been with you.

504
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,120
I am very satisfied.

505
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,120
There must be a way.

506
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,120
Si Ma Jiao,

507
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,120
can you hug me?

508
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,120
Si Ma Jiao,

509
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,120
I love you very much.

510
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,120
If I don't love you,

511
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,120
no matter where I go, I will be happy.

512
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,120
I love you.

513
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,120
I love you.

514
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,120
I love you.

515
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,120
I love you.

516
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,120
I love you.

517
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,120
If I don't love you,

518
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,120
no matter where I go, I will be happy.

519
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,120
In the future,

520
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,120
if you see something interesting,

521
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,120
you can go and see it for me.

522
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,120
If there is something delicious,

523
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,120
you can cook it for me.

524
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:34,120
One touch islas

525
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,120
Wilson Fei

526
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:47,320
I shed tears

527
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,760
I look back at the past

528
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:57,640
I look back at the past

529
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:01,080
Only because of the hope of love

530
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,040
Ting Yue

531
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,080
Ting Yue

532
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,240
Ting Yue

533
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,400
Ting Yue

534
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,880
Ting Yue

535
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:17,520
nocous

536
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,480
I zeroed

00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:21,800
la네요

538
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:30,880
Oi

539
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,440
Ting Yue

540
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,120
We can wait for a few days for the symptoms.

541
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,200
Go clean them up.

542
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,900
It's just a light squad of brain bilir.

543
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,240
You can be free- lemon.

544
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,060
If the pins admitted are fully nearsighted,

545
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,660
we can proceed yourварanke process.

546
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,280
Poppad can't be infected

547
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,520
Between gebruit the

548
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:31,000
Has this been a dream

549
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,460
Suspect 1 of the first round

550
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,580
Make way

551
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,420
Make way

552
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,460
Sister Li Li

553
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:52,940
I know

554
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:53,780
I will be right there

555
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,460
This is our company's proposal

556
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,140
First is the scene introduction

557
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,860
Then this room may as well be your favorite.

558
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:13,800
Let me talk.

559
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,020
Let Tom go with the layman.

560
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,100
You can't let him all the time for no reason.

561
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,060
Come in.

562
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:34,420
Ms. Li Li.

563
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:37,180
How's your health?

564
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,020
I'm sorry.

565
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,020
Are you ready to give up?

566
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,620
No.

567
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,420
I don't have a chance.

568
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,020
You have a chance for those who are ready.

569
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:54,740
I heard that they had a proposal meeting this afternoon.

570
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,420
You can take your case to find him in person.

571
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,420
Okay.

572
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,660

Mr. Wei, is there any proposal that you're satisfied with?

579
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,780
Are there any other companies that want to propose?

580

There's one more.

581
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,900
It's the company that did the Qingu Mountain project proposal last time.
