00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Did I say the demon aura affected the killer?

6
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Madam, I came to pack for you.

7
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Wait at the door.

8
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yes.

9
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Liang Chen, did you hear what happened in the palace?

10
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I just heard that the birds in the harem died overnight.

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Did I do it?

12
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Could it be that the demon energy in my body has appeared again?

13
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I have to go find my master.

14
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Father.

15
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I heard that you went to see Madam Yan.

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I sent you a letter many times to remind you to stay away from Madam Yan.

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Why don't you listen to me?

18
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But father taught me before.

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
He asked me to ask for more of his Majesty's pleasure to control him.

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I just want to give Madam Yan some color.

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So that she can always compete with me.

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
This is not the time to compete with me.

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Just listen to me.

24
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I did this for your safety.

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
This is the treasure I got from the immortal.

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You can take it with you to protect yourself.

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The Demon Energy in the Demon Pill

28
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The demon energy in your body has begun to grow.

29
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The death of the flying Qin was influenced by the demon energy.

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Fortunately, I have found a prescription today

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
that can suppress the demon energy temporarily.

32
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What if the demon energy is increased to a point where we can't control it?

33
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Is there any way to deal with it?

34
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You need to eliminate your immortal cultivation.

35
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
In this way, the demon energy in your body will become a waste of energy.

36
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You can't control it.

37
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But your cultivation will be destroyed.

38
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
If I eliminate my cultivation, I can't protect the Four-Horse Sect.

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
If I am controlled by the demon energy,

40
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I will kill the Four-Horse Sect

41
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
for what I have.

42
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
This is the destiny of Youyan.

43
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Is there really no other way to solve the problem?

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The fire and the demon energy are competing with each other.

45
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
If one day the demon energy is out of control

46
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and completely suppresses the fire,

47
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
if you don't want to eliminate your cultivation,

48
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
you need to increase the power of the fire in your body.

49
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
How?

50
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Use your blood as a source to burn the fire.

51
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
But this is like a shadow.

52
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
If you want to suppress the demon energy completely,

53
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm afraid...

54
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm afraid your life will be in danger.

55
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Your life will also be destroyed.

56
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I heard from Jiao'er that

57
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Madam Yan is a goddess from the mortal world.

58
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
She has a connection with Jiao'er.

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:14,740
The cultivation of the

60
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,740
Demon energy is also a destiny.

61
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,740
The Empress Dowager and His Majesty

62
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,740
are also mother and son in the past life.

63
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,740
I think His Majesty transferred to this world

64
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,740
to follow you.

65
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,740
He wants to make another destiny with you.

66
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,740
Really?

67
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,740
Yes.

68
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,740
What a lovely girl.

69
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,740
Jiao'er is fond of you.

70
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,740
I think

71
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,740
after he finishes the ceremony,

72
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,740
he will confer you as the Empress.

73
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,740
By then,

74
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,740
after you finish the ceremony,

75
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,740
I will finally let go of this heart.

76
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,740
Your Highness,

77
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,740
you mean

78
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,740
the Empress can enter the Hushan Hall

79
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,740
to perform the ceremony of the defeat of the mountain?

80
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,740
Of course.

81
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,740
The Empress

82
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,740
must enter the Hushan Hall to perform the defeat of the mountain.

83
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,740
This is also the rule

84
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,740
passed down by our Huguo for so many years.

85
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,740
After the defeat of the mountain,

86
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,740
Jiao'er can formally inherit

87
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,740
the jade seal placed in the hall

88
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,740
and officially become

89
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,740
the king of our Huguo.

90
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,740
Your Majesty,

91
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,740
the ceremony of the defeat of the mountain

92
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,740
must wait until the wedding.

93
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,740
The ceremony of the defeat of the mountain

94
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,740
must wait until the wedding.

95
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,740
This is the rule

96
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,740
passed down by our Huguo for so many years.

97
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,740
Why do you ask this all of a sudden?

98
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,740
Your Majesty,

99
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,740
I have done a great favor

100
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,740
for you.

101
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,740
Can you confer the Empress

102
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,740
as the Empress?

103
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,740
After the ceremony,

104
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,740
can you directly confer the Empress?

105
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,740
Thank you, Your Majesty.

106
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,740
Sooner or later, it will be yours.

107
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,740
Why are you so anxious?

108
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,740
I...

109
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,740
What's wrong?

110
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,740
Why is it so hot?

111
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,740
Your Majesty, don't worry about me.

112
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,740
Just take a rest for a while.

113
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,740
I have dreamt

114
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,740
that the fire in my dream

115
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,740
was burning in my body

116
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,740
constantly

117
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,740
and was similar to what you are now.

118
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,740
Our pain was not the same at that time.

119
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,740
Until I had the spiritual fire

120
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,740
that Your Majesty used your spirit to practice,

121
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,740
I knew

122
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,740
how deep the pain

123
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,740
Your Majesty suffered at that time was.

124
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,740
At that time,

125
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,740
how did you feel?

126
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,740
I would do this.

127
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,740
At that time,

128
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,740
I had snowed for Your Majesty.

129
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,740
It's been a long time

130
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,740
since I saw snow.

131
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,740
When it's snowing,

132
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,740
I will be with you.

133
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,740
Okay.

134
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,740
When we are together,

135
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,740
can I not call myself a concubine

136
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,740
and you can't call yourself an orphan?

137
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,740
I think you,

138
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,740
me and us

139
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,740
are both very beautiful.

140
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,740
You are very confident.

141
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,740
I know.

142
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,740
I know.

143
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,740
Does it still hurt?

144
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,740
Is it fine?

145
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,740
I am fine.

146
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,740
You kissed me first.

147
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,740
I kissed you?

148
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,740
It's over after you said so.

149
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,740
Don't make a scene with me.

150
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,740
I will go to sleep.

151
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,980
You've put on a good costume.

152
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,540
I'm shocked that I don't look familiar.

153
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,260
Are you mad at me?

154
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:18,820
No.

155
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,140
It should be great

156
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,580
if we environment each other, no?

157
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,940
If you dare to Create a fuss with me,

158
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,200
It doesn't matter, I'll make it safe.

159
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,580
You set me up.

160
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,400
Why don't you want to meet me?

161
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,780
I have my reasons.

162
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,740
Then why can't you tell me

163
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,060
the reason?

164
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,100
It's not the time yet.

165
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,060
Then when is it?

166
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:13,780
Let me ask you.

167
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,420
Do you know what the Lin Mansion is?

168
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,020
No.

169
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,740
Then cover your face and sleep.

170
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,860
You'll know when you finish your journey.

171
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,300
Okay.

172
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,460
I came to see you by the lake.

173
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:55,860
I miss you.

174
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,940
Why did Nian Jiu send me a letter?

175
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,540
It's a lie.

176
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,020
Go to the fraud group and study for a few days.

177
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,020
If you have something to do next time,

178
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,260
send me a letter first.

179
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,900
Don't come to the house.

180
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,180
I asked Nian Jiu to send me a letter

181
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,420
after finding the traces of the rumors.

182
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,980
Did he find it?

183
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:04,900
The

184
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,580
Your Majesty.

185
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,300
How dare you show lovely tricks

186
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,660
and deceive the people?

187
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:10,860
What?

188
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:11,820
What are you?

189
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,060
aaS.

190
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,660
You hemmed at Ziquan Palace

191
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,620
and killed all the people on the way.

192
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,100
How ridiculous!

193
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,620
Go.

194
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,260
Go get my cloak and the Demon-slaying Mirror.

195
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,340
Your Grace, you can't go.

196
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,820
Why should I be afraid of the Demon-slaying Mirror?

197
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,220
I want His Majesty and Her Majesty

198
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,460
to see the real face of this witch.

199
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,500
You...

200
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,300
If I don't return to the palace after an hour,

201
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,180
you should take someone to find me.

202
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:55,940
Understand?

203
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,260
Yes.

204
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,540
The Demon-slaying Mirror

205
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,500
Why is she asleep?

206
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,940
Where is Ning Jiu?

207
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,020
There.

208
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,260
Blood.

209
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,660
So much blood.

210
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,500
Your Majesty.

211
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:53,980
Your Majesty.

212
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,100
In Madam Yan's palace,

213
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,980
we found Lady Siyan's body.

214
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,100
Her blood was dried up.

215
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,060
The blood was eaten by the beast.

216
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,780
Can we find out the time of death?

217
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,380
It was probably at midnight last night.

218
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,180
It's in line with the words of the maids and guards

219
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,820
in the palace.

220
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:10,860
Your Majesty.

221
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,060
All signs show that

222
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:16,660
Madam Yan...

223
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,300
Nantang.

224
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,140
You've checked the notes of both letters.

225
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,420
Can't you tell that it's a false alarm?

226
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,500
Your Majesty.

227
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,140
If it's a false alarm,

228
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,740
then how could Madam Yan's blood

229
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,180
come from the clothes?

230
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,020
You should check it.

231
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:38,780
Your Majesty.

232
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,460
To find out the truth,

233
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,740
I beg Your Majesty

234
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,020
to lock Madam Yan up.

235
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:48,980
Chen Tang.

236
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,660
Judging from your position,

237
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,020
you're the one who should be held accountable.

238
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,460
If I keep being the emperor,

239
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,740
I'll be loyal to you for a day.

240
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:04,740
Your Majesty.

241
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,860
To clear my name,

242
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,460
please allow Lord Chen to lock me up

243
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,100
and put me in the back room.

244
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,100
No.

245
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,700
I won't let you go.

246
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,260
I've made up my mind.

247
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,180
Please lead the way.

248
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,700
The prison is cleaner than I thought.

249
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,620
It's not the time.

250
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,420
How can you be in the mood to do this?

251
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:42,740
Hongluo.

252
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:43,940
Nianjiu.

253
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,620
Tian Yan.

254
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,220
Why did you ask for the next month

255
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,900
for the matter of Lady Sixian?

256
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,780
All the evidence

257
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,340
points to the fact that I killed Lady Sixian.

258
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,420
If I'm protected by the Sima Sect,

259
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,980
it will surely cause dissatisfaction

260
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,780
among the people in the court

261
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,700
and be a good opportunity for the Queen of Nanye.

262
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,900
If I ask for the next month,

263
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,380
I'll be the one who will be punished.

264
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:03,940
The prison

265
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,260
can at least help me clear my name.

266
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:07,700
Besides,

267
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,340
I'm also worried about what Youyan will do.

268
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,340
She's the devil in my body.

269
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,860
It's better to stay away from Sima Sect.

270
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,180
It should be Sima Sect.

271
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,060
You should leave now.

272
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,260
Get up.

273
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,700
You're here

274
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,540
and don't bring along a profile picture.

275
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,220
Aren't you scared that I'm a demon?

276
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,860
If you're a purely dirty monster,

277
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,700
you don't need to die.

278
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,460
The dragon emperor sleeping next to you

279
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,940
is not more delicious than others.

280
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,100
Let's go.

281
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,300
Come back with me.

282
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,340
I won't let you live in such a dirty place.

283
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,060
No.

284
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,380
If I leave,

285
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,660
those courtiers will make trouble.

286
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,420
Your Highness.

287
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,580
Lady Yan didn't do

288
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,740
the death of Lady Siyan.

289
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,540
You've read so many books.

290
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,380
But you don't know the time.

291
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,420
And you put Lady Yan in prison.

292
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:43,620
Your Majesty.

293
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:44,660
This...

294
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,420
Lady Yan did it herself.

295
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,580
But she did it

296
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,460
so well.

297
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,500
People who are determined

298
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,540
won't put her in prison

299
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,420
and get rid of her hostility.

300
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,540
Do you understand?

301
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:00,780
Yes.

302
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,500
Yi Huo.

303
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,420
You should go to the manor of the Marquis Nan Yan more often.

304
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,660
I'm afraid

305
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,020
he will blame Lady Yan

306
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,180
for the death of Lady Siyan.

307
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,820
And he will do something wrong.

308
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,140
Yes.

309
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,220
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

310
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,140
Zhentang.

311
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,500
You go on to investigate Lady Siyan.

312
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,460
Yes.

313
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,140
And

314
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,420
make the food in the prison better.

315
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:33,740
And prepare the meat

316
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,660
in a clean and comfortable way.

317
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,420
Yes.

318
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,300
Let me go!

319
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,460
Let me go!

320
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,780
Let me go!

321
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,500
Be quiet!

322
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,500
Let me go!

323
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,420
Come on.

324
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,620
Lady Siyan is in a sad state.

325
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,500
The Marquis can find so many children.

326
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,900
It's really a lot of work.

327
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,580
I didn't expect my daughter

328
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,700
to die in the hands of the witch Liao Tingyan.

329
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,860
I wish I had made a decision earlier.

330
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:28,820
Now

331
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,740
she's gone.

332
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,940
I must get rid of the witch Liao Tingyan

333
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,860
and avenge my daughter.

334
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,220
I'll do whatever I want.

335
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,740
Don't worry, Marquis.

336
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,540
Just wait and see.

337
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,580
The state of the protection is about to be in a big mess.

338
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,260
By then,

339
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,940
you will be the ruler of the troubled world.

340
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:56,940
By then,

341
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,140
I will have Sima hand over the witch.

342
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,420
I'll do whatever I want for my daughter.

343
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,060
Thank you, Marquis.

344
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,700
Liao Tingyan,

345
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,420
this is the gift I gave you and Sima.

346
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,660
Liao Tingyan,

347
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,820
you're not the only one who's in danger.

348
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,700
You're the only one who's in danger.

349
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,220
You're the only one who's in danger.

350
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,700
You're the only one who's in danger.

351
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,260
You're the only one who's in danger.

352
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,620
You're the only one who's in danger.

353
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,020
You're the only one who's in danger.

354
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,540
You're the only one who's in danger.

355
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,140
You're the only one who's in danger.

356
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,740
You're the only one who's in danger.

357
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,380
You're the only one who's in danger.

358
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,100
You're the only one who's in danger.

359
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,660
You're the only one who's in danger.

360
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,260
You're the only one who's in danger.

361
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,740
You're the only one who's in danger.

362
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,340
You're the only one who's in danger.

363
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,820
You're the only one who's in danger.

364
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,780
I'll take the medicine Master prescribed for me.

365
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,820
The demon aura has been suppressed a lot.

366
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,940
Why did this happen all of a sudden?

367
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:02,320
The Demon Bra besides Magic Land

368
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,780
No!

369
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:28,780
The sudden cold and panic

370
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,780
must be caused by the smoke.

371
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,780
It's to increase the demon energy in my body

372
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,780
and to shake the throne of the Four-Horse Sect.

373
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,780
The fire and the demon energy are different.

374
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,780
If one day the demon energy is out of control

375
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,780
and it completely suppresses the fire,

376
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,780
if you don't want to lose your cultivation,

377
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,780
you need to increase the power of the fire in your body.

378
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,780
Use your blood

379
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,780
as a fire to burn the fire.

380
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,780
But this is like a moment of shadow formation.

381
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,780
If you want to completely suppress the demon energy,

382
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,780
I'm afraid you have to use your life's blood as a weapon.

383
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:05,780
Your life

384
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,780
will also dissipate with time.

385
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,780
The Demon King's Tomb

386
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,780
Your Majesty,

387
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,780
the mountain army has arrived in the Han Dynasty.

388
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,780
A large number of people have starved to death.

389
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,780
Many soldiers and immortals have been in the field.

390
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,780
They found the bodies of the same men and women who were starved to death.

391
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,780
I'm afraid the hungry people

392
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,780
have already started to eat with their children.

393
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,780
What a good boy.

394
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:05,780
The Zhong Lang family is really good at finding excuses.

395
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,780
Your Majesty,

396
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,780
I've found out that

397
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,780
the same men and women in the field

398
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,780
have disappeared before the Han Dynasty.

399
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,780
He Ran appeared in the field.

400
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,780
His death was like a split with Lady Sixian.

401
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:20,780
There must be a demon in it.

402
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,780
Your Majesty,

403
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:25,780
I've been watching the sky and the earth lately.

404
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:28,780
I found a demon star in the palace.

405
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,780
The drought is all caused by this demon star.

406
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,780
If you let go of the demon star,

407
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,780
it's enough to destroy the country.

408
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,780
I beg Your Majesty

409
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,780
to burn the demon girl,

410
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,780
and set up a banquet

411
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,780
to kill the people.

412
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,780
The palace is not only Lady Yan.

413
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,780
The imperial envoy, Yan Zhi,

414
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,780
the demon star

415
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,780
doesn't represent the valley.

416
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,780
It represents the world.

417
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:04,780
The world is not the same as the palace.

418
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,780
The world is different.

419
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,780
The world is different.

420
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,780
The world is different.

421
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,780
The world is different.

422
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,780
The world is different.

423
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,780
The world is different.

424
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,780
The world is different.

425
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,780
Your Majesty,

426
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,780
the ceremony is about to begin.

427
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,780
Why are you still talking nonsense?

428
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,780
I'm a little confused.

429
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:31,780
I'm just taking advantage of the wise and wise of Marquis Nan Yan.

430
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,780
Your Majesty,

431
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:35,780
for the sake of that demon girl,

432
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:39,780
can't you hear the words of the demon star?

433
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,780
I remember not long ago,

434
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,780
all the ministers praised Lady Yan.

435
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,780
She was a goddess, Lin Fan,

436
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,780
and blessed by the people.

437
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,780
Now,

438
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,780
she is turned into a demon

439
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:03,780
and she is blamed for the destruction of the country.

440
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,780
You all are holding phoenix deer

441
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,780
and standing high,

442
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,780
but you are pushing the responsibility of the country

443
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,780
onto a woman.

444
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,780
You are pushing the responsibility of the country

445
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,780
onto a woman.

446
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,780
You still have the nerve to tell me

447
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,780
that you are against your words.

448
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,780
General Zhong.

449
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,780
Yes, Your Majesty.

450
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,780
Open the warehouse and let the food out.

451
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,780
Strengthen the local border guards

452
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,780
to prevent the bandits from causing trouble.

453
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,780
Yes, Your Majesty.

454
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:43,780
Chen Tang.

455
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,780
Yes, Your Majesty.

456
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:47,780
You will investigate the case of the same woman and man.

457
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,780
Yes, Your Majesty.

458
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,780
Marquis Nan Yan.

459
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,780
You just suffered from the pain of losing your daughter.

460
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,780
You should rest more.

461
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,780
You don't need to have a court court these days.

462
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:12,780
Thank you for your understanding, Your Majesty.

463
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,780
It's okay, Your Majesty.

464
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,780
It's okay.

465
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,780
I will help you.

466
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,780
I will help you.

467
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,780
I will help you.

468
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,780
It's okay.

469
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,780
I will help you.

470
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,780
I will help you.

471
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,780
I will help you.

472
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,780
You are so weak in the talisman.

473
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,780
You were beaten up

474
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,780
when you had a fight.

475
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,780
Master,

476
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,780
you want this, right?

477
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,780
It's too sweet.

478
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,780
Don't be so cheeky.

479
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,780
I can tell you want to eat it.

480
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,780
Stop taking a bath.

481
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,260
Why did I have such a strange dream?

482
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,260
As expected,

483
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,060
the fire has suppressed the demon energy in my body.

484
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,420
Why did you call me so urgently?

485
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:14,580
Sit down.

486
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,580
I want you to help Sima Jiao.

487
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,740
You can take some demons

488
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,860
to pacify the drought and famine in the mortal world.

489
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,820
Those mortals think you are a demon.

490
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,380
Do you still want to help them?

491
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,940
They are just bewitched by rumors.

492
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,900
The people are innocent.

493
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:36,660
Besides,

494
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,740
the sky is falling,

495
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,980
can you break the rumors that I am a demon?

496
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,420
Okay.

497
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,140
You are the princess.

498
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,140
I will listen to you.

499
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,340
But why do you look pale?

500
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,300
Isn't my skin

501
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,940
more smooth and moist?

502
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:55,820
Besides,

503
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,180
those innocent dead men and women

504
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,140
must have something to do with the rumors.

505
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,580
Maybe you can find the traces of rumors

506
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,940
by investigating the remains of their remains.

507
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,260
Please think about it for a long time.

508
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:10,860
I see.

509
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:11,980
Don't worry.

510
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,140
If it doesn't rain,

511
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,700
we can't even survive

512
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,820
if we don't get food.

513
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,460
Yes.

514
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,500
His Majesty is really bewitched by the demon girl.

515
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,860
The people are crying.

516
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,260
++

517
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,820
The moon-caster in the both parts

518
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,740
is really波甘 worry.

519
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,280
Podcast

520
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,060
Dry it out on me Song Hai

521
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:19,820
It's raining

522
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,060
It's raining

523
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,180
It's raining

524
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,380
Dry it out on the walls

525
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,300
It's raining

526
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,940
It's raining

527
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,860
So great

528
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:36,380
It's raining

529
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,220
Darling

530
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,220
It's raining

531
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,540
Go!

532
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,540
Go!

533
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,540
Go!

534
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,540
Go!

535
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,260
Your Majesty,

536
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,620
the drought should be eased by today.

537
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,420
Besides, as you ordered,

538
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,500
the disaster relief camp is located everywhere.

539
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,220
The transportation and transportation

540
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,780
of disaster relief food and supplies

541
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,260
are all in the drought zone.

542
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,180
Good.

543
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,780
Make sure to check the situation carefully.

544
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,420
If there is any news of the disaster,

545
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:05,060
punish the people.

546
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:05,700
Yes.

547
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,420
How is the investigation

548
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,700
of Tongnan?

549
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,420
Your Majesty,

550
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,540
I found out

551
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,780
that the Tongnan girls were all deceived

552
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,060
or taken away.

553
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,980
I have taken the hostage.

554
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,380
But he insisted

555
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,060
that the Tongnan girls

556
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,540
were all given to...

557
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:28,780
Mrs. Yan.

558
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,940
Nonsense.

559
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,060
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

560
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,420
The person behind this

561
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,900
seems to be here for Mrs. Yan.

562
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,460
This kind of trap

563
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,500
will not only happen once.

564
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,380
Search the whole country

565
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,700
and find out the person behind this.

566
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:48,500
Yes.

567
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:49,660
Your Majesty,

568
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,340
I heard the servants in Nanyan's mansion

569
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,460
hear the crying of children

570
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,380
at night.

571
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,940
Is this related to Nanyan?

572
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,380
Nanyan wants to kill Mrs. Yan.

573
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,220
I can understand.

574
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,260
But

575
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,140
she won't want to kill Lady Sixian, right?

576
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,140
Chen Tang,

577
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:08,820
Chen Tang,

578
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,900
you can check the clue

579
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,060
in Nanyan's mansion.

580
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,220
Maybe there is something

581
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,380
we don't know.

582
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:16,500
Yes.

583
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,100
Tomorrow is the ceremony.

584
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,220
Did you

585
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,500
tell Mrs. Yan about this?

586
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,220
What did she say?

587
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,820
Mrs. Yan said

588
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,340
she was guilty

589
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,860
so she asked her

590
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,340
to keep it while she was on the hill.

591
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,300
The ceremony

592
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,140
for the tiles and tiles

593
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,020
They are the lucky ones from Shi's family.

594
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,780
When their children have Good

595
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,180
átctout their overthrow.

596
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,940

598
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,140
The temples of 2 families.

599
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,620

00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:43,460
Therefore, the three

606
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:46,100

607
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,820

616
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,340
When I'm done,

617
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,780
I'll kill you!

618
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,540
Why didn't you kill me

619
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,660
when you're in such pain?

620
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,340
I have no regrets.

621
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,660

00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:28,860

Boss, boss.

626
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,620
Don't always have such a beautiful face.

627
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,300
Ding Yue!

628
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,140

629
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:46,580
Ding Yue!

630
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,420
Your life must still be here.

631
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,620
I must find it.

632
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:51,900
You can treat today

633
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,940
as our first day.

634
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,980

635
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,460
I'll recreate it for you.

636
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,380
It belongs to the present.

637
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,740
Our memories

638
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,940
are not the past.

639
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,500
I left you

640
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,820
everything you like.

641
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,860
Wherever you are,

642
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,020
I'll be by your side.

643
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,980
Long live Your Majesty!

644
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,620
Long live Your Majesty!

645
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:53,860
Come out.

646
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,340
You don't even listen to me now.

647
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,340
Stupid snake.

648
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:05,820
Master,

649
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,580
you remember it now.

650
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,420
Has your power

651
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,860
recovered?

652
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,020
It's still a flesh-and-blood fetus.

653
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,100
It's just a little weak.

654
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,460
So I need you

655
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,620
to do something for me.

656
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,060
Please do as you wish.

657
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,140
I want to have a snowy night.

658
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,000
painful.

659
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,180
Only passing be its pleasurable.

660
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,460
It doesn't hurt.

661
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:08,700
Thanks.

662
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:27,100
Since I was elegant with my blood handwriting,

663
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,900
I started to do such weird tricks often.

664
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,220
Thewire and those department items

665
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,380
can only be seen on the 돼요.

666
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,780
The darker is bright

667
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,900
the brighter.

668
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:49,100
Who's hebbener of device called website?

669
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,300
What on earth could that be?

670
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,020
I don't know.

671
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,820
Did she catch Youyan?

672
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:07,660
Impossible.

673
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:11,020
As for Madam Yan,

674
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,060
why don't you ask His Majesty in person?

675
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:16,580
Please.

676
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:40,340
Why is gatherings in Sichuan Happy празд

677
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,500
planned to be done by His Majesty?

678
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,540
I'm afraid

679
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:46,540
that His Majesty doesn't seem to want

680
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,380
His Majesty to remember the past.

681
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,700
He asks if he needs to go back to B趴

682
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,660
when 어

683
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,300
,

684
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:56,940
Ora

685

To

686
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,940
in

687
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:00,940
I looked a little back,

688
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,940
and noticed a light.

689
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,380
She pulled some milk.

690
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,220
I know

691
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,940
she would break the flask.

692
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,180
She read it herself,

693
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,380
and then she spent her time regretting.

694
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,100
In this eyes of mine,

695
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,260
the phantom Murong is葉尖 reserve in calluses.

696
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,540
She chose a few pieces,

697
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:28,820
and姐能遣溜 rất多關於

698
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:32,000

700
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,580
You remember

701
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,580
You finally don't want to hide it from me.

702
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,580
No.

703
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,580
During the years I lost my memory,

704
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,580
I could feel the bitterness and pain

705
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,580
hidden in the valley.

706
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,580
After going through this,

707
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,580
I finally know how painful it is.

708
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,580
The snow I prepared for you today,

709
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,580
I'll treat it as a gift for you,

710
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,580
okay?

711
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,580
No.

712
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,580
You don't know how painful I am.

713
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:00,580
You made me suffer day and night because of losing you.

714
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,580
You hid the soul of my soul

715
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,580
and gave it to me.

716
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,580
Aren't you afraid that I'll take the soul to run away

717
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,580
and make you lose your soul?

718
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,580
That's my choice for you.

719
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,580
If you'd rather endure the pain

720
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:16,580
and let me stay,

721
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:18,580
I'll stay.

722
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,580
If you don't want to,

723
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:23,580
I'll give you the soul of my soul

724
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,580
and make you a lamp.

725
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,580
In short, I gave you the thing

726
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,580
and you can do whatever you want.

727
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,580
The End

728
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:19,580
You're always like this.

729
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,580
You don't care about the pain

730
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:25,580
or the pain.

731
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:28,580
You always endure it

732
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:32,580
and don't let others find you.

733
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,580
I didn't understand it before,

734
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:39,580
but I understand it now.

735
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:44,580
If the past was painful for you,

736
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:47,580
why would I have to let you remember it?

737
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:51,580
You said

738
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,580
you wanted to live happily.

739
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:58,580
Isn't it better

740
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:00,580
to live a normal life

741
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,580
and live a peaceful life?

742
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:05,580
Compared with losing your memories,

743
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:08,580
the pain in the past

744
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:13,580
is not worth mentioning.

745
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:20,580
I'm sorry.

746
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:22,580
I'm sorry.

747
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:24,580
I'm sorry.

748
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:26,580
I'm sorry.

749
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:28,580
I'm sorry.

750
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:30,580
I'm sorry.

751
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:32,580
I'm sorry.

752
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:34,580
I'm sorry.

753
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:36,580
I'm sorry.

754
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:38,580
