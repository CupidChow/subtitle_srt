1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,760
It's been 500 years.

3
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,720
Everything is coming to an end.

4
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,320
Si Ma Jiao,

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,680
there are wardrobes in the mountain.

6
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,360
Eight great masters sealed you here

7
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,760
and made you the leader of the immortal mansion.

8
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,280
You're in the dead end.

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,480
How can you change your fate?

10
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,280
Those evil disciples

11
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,880
put me in the dark.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,800
They want me to surrender.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,640
But I've already trained the spiritual fox.

14
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,000
The new moon night is coming.

15
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,080
This mountain

16
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,360
can't trap me anymore.

17
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,480
Now,

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,400
I'm afraid of the death.

19
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,880
I'm afraid of the last time.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

23
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

24
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

25
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,400
Is this heaven or hell?

26
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

27
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,400
Junior Liao,

28
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,200
Master asked you to find him in the main hall.

29
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,600
Junior Liao?

30
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,600
Master?

31
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,800
Main hall?

32
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,000
Junior, don't worry.

33
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,200
You just came to Qinggutian.

34
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,200
You didn't know the mountain

35
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,600
was a forbidden place for the masters.

36
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,000
So you broke in without permission.

37
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,200
Master won't blame you for that.

38
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Come with me.

39
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,200
Qinggutian, Qinggushan?

40
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,800
Why are they so similar?

41
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,800
You know Mr. Wei from Saishan Technology, right?

42
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,200
He saw your case in Qinggushan.

43
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,400
He thinks it's good.

44
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,600
You went to Qinggushan tonight.

45
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You'll go to visit him tomorrow morning.

46
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,400
Junior Liao.

47
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,600
Forget it.

48
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,200
I made too many mistakes.

49
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,600
I'll just pretend.

50
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

51
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,000
Is this the legendary world of cultivating immortals?

52
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Master, Junior Liao is here.

53
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,600
Okay.

54
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,800
Changqing,

55
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,400
go back to your work.

56
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,200
Yes.

57
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,600
I'll leave first.

58
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
Then I...

59
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,600
Ting Yan.

60
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,400
Why don't you come in

61
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
and let me check your spiritual talisman?

62
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,600
It seems that my body

63
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,600
is called Ting Yan.

64
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,200
The barrier outside the Three Sacred Mountains

65
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,000
really damaged your spiritual talisman.

66
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,600
Spiritual talisman?

67
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,600
What's that?

68
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,600
Spiritual talisman is the most secret place of a person.

69
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,600
The sacred stone,

70
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,600
the sacred silk,

71
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,000
and the sacred soul are all in it.

72
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,200
What are you talking about?

73
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,400
Why can't I understand?

74
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,600
If you hurt the spiritual talisman,

75
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,800
you'll be like you,

76
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,200
confused and talk nonsense.

77
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,800
Since you've forgotten your past,

78
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,200
I'll tell you.

79
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,000
This is a small sect

80
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
under the four-fifths of the Qinggutian Immortal.

81
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,000
You've been under the Qinggutian Sect for more than three months.

82
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,800
I asked you to come here

83
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,600
because I'm going to take you away

84
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,800
to participate in the selection.

85
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,400
No way.

86
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,400
Why is there a scroll in the immortal world?

87
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,400
You've forgotten it?

88
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,400
The senior of the Immortal's family,

89
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,800
the one who has the highest rank,

90
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,000
will be the one to die.

91
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,800
So the senior and the eight princesses

92
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,400
want to choose some qualified disciples to enter the mountain

93
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
to take care of the daily life of the senior

94
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,000
and follow the senior to practice.

95
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,200
Don't worry.

96
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,800
Our Qinggutian

97
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,800
is just a collection of books.

98
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,600
Then I'm just a mother.

99
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,800
Okay.

100
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,200
As long as I'm alive,

101
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,200
I can say anything.

102
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,200
Slow down, Master.

103
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,400
Don't be afraid.

104
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,400
At your feet

105
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,400
is the Gengchen's mansion,

106
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,800
which is 8,888 miles away from Mian Yan.

107
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,200
It has been open for tens of thousands of years.

108
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,600
The first emissary of the Gengchen's mansion

109
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,800
was the senior of the later generations

110
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
and his last name was Sima.

111
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,800
Now the last Sima of the Gengchen's mansion

112
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,800
is the one who is about to leave the Pass.

113
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,800
It seems that the senior is

114
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,400
a big figure in your family.

115
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,000
The senior is the most respected person.

116
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,400
The whole Gengchen's mansion

117
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,600
is because of the senior

118
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,400
that it has the abundant spiritual energy.

119
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,800
As for the senior,

120
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,400
he is the master of the inner mansion.

121
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,600
He has been in charge of protecting the Sima family

122
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,200
for generations.

123
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,800
And the inner mansion is divided into eight palaces.

124
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,600
Under the eight palaces

125
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,600
are our small sects.

126
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,000
Master,

127
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,200
since the senior has left the Pass,

128
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,800
why doesn't he come out

129
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,000
and choose someone to go in?

130
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,600
I'm not very clear about this.

131
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,800
Maybe the senior is too quiet

132
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,200
and doesn't want to go out.

133
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,300
(*Lalai Hall, the firstai Warriors Hall-Moplis Hall in Xin 하면 Hall.)

134
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,000
This is Fengqi Hall.

135
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,000
Now this is where the eight princesses

136
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
What are they showing?

137
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Don't mind the winning or losing.

138
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Just deal with it.

139
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm fine.

140
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Don't worry.

141
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's late.

142
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Go in.

143
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Wait.

144
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm used to it.

145
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'll see him later.

146
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
What are you doing?

147
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So reckless.

148
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Why are you here?

149
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Sorry.

150
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Please continue.

151
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Who is this?

152
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Hello.

153
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm a disciple of Dongyang Zhenren,

154
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
a disciple of Dongyang Zhenren,

155
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
a disciple of the Star Valley Heaven.

156
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So you're not a junior.

157
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You're a junior.

158
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Then,

159
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I bow to you.

160
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You're a few hundred years older than me.

161
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You can even call me a granddaughter.

162
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Don't flatter me.

163
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
A low-level person like you

164
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
actually joined the selection with us.

165
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Why do I feel a little cold?

166
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Am I right?

167
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yes.

168
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm not good at it.

169
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Just by looking at my face, I look good.

170
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Thank you.

171
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You speak so nicely.

172
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You...

173
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
What are you talking about?

174
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Who is flattering me?

175
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Welcome to the Grand Master's Gate.

176
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Today,

177
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
all the princesses

178
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
will choose from the present

179
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
hundreds of disciples

180
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
to serve the Grand Master in the mountain.

181
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Take care of the Grand Master's wife

182
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
and practice with him.

183
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The selection officially begins.

184
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
All the disciples

185
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
just need to sit in the star plate

186
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
and open the heavenly spirit.

187
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Wait for the good news.

188
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yes.

189
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
How do I open the heavenly spirit?

190
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Just sit here?

191
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm here to collect the tree.

192
00:11:49,000 --> 00:12:06,380
Who bought me a

193
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm not sure.

194
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I didn't get the right one.

195
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
How did I choose the trash from the three-point tree?

196
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm not sure.

197
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm not sure.

198
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
How did I choose the trash from the three-point tree?

199
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I want to ask the trash too.

200
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Mother.

201
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Master.

202
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I heard that you've been selected.

203
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm so happy.

204
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm so happy.

205
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I, Qinggutian, have been created.

206
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Stop.

207
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Didn't we agree that

208
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I just went through the process?

209
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Why did you get selected?

210
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Can you give me a feedback?

211
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I don't want to go.

212
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Some people are taking this offer.

213
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What?

214
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Anyway, I'm willing to give this opportunity to others.

215
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
But we, Qinggutian,

216
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
are just a small sect under the Four Seasons Palace.

217
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's a great fortune to be selected.

218
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
There's no reason to refuse.

219
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Besides,

220
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
this is the decision made by the Grand Master and the eight princesses.

221
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
There's no room for change.

222
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Why is there such a pressure in the cultivation world?

223
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I just want to be a beautiful trash.

224
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And I don't know anything about this.

225
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
What if I make the Grand Master angry?

226
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'll be so unhappy.

227
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I can't be the one.

228
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Don't worry.

229
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Although I've never seen that Zizang Taoist Lord,

230
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
it sounds good.

231
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I think he's a generous and kind elder.

232
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
If you don't want to serve your ancestors,

233
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I think he won't make it hard for you.

234
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Three wins, three losses, and the spirit energy is the best.

235
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You'll be able to improve your cultivation this time.

236
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
This kind of promotion and promotion

237
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
has no advantage to me at all.

238
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I just want to eat well and drink well.

239
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I just want to stay.

240
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Congratulations, sister.

241
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Congratulations, sister.

242
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Congratulations, sister.

243
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You're a great teacher.

244
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
This is the gift from my brother.

245
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Yes.

246
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Why does it sound like I've become the hope of the whole village?

247
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
This pressure is too great.

248
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's not great.

249
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
All right, all right, all right, let go.

250
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You guys,

251
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
don't give him any more pressure.

252
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Ting Yan, you can be admitted to the school.

253
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You've improved a lot for me.

254
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
After all,

255
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
you're not a high-level disciple.

256
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And you don't want to serve your ancestors.

257
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I think it won't take long.

258
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
He'll pick you up.

259
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
So there's no KPI.

260
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
What did he say?

261
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
That's fine.

262
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Forget it.

263
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Anyway, reality can't go back.

264
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It seems to be okay to stay away from the life of a bull horse for the time being.

265
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
That's執行ış?

266
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
That hurts.

267
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,140
Yes, I heard about the

268
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,000
Park Catch İş on Sunset ritual.

269
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Quickly.

270
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Please help me take this.

271
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Go to the Park.

272
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Okay.

273
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
This is the Three Nik vas Kato.

274
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,040
After the war,

275
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,800
this place has been closed for 500 years.

276
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,240
No one enters the palace again.

277
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,800
It sounds like a hidden talisman.

278
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,240
Drop him now!

279
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,200
Not yet, now!

280
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:10,960
Kill her!

281
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,360
That's hard.

282
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,720
Buried her!

283
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,200
She hides and dies!

284
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,640
I don't dare to among you!

285
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,960
What's going on?

286
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
No.

287
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Are we really

288
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
an righteous ancestor?

289
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Not from the Nanyu clan?

290
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
The death of the Zizang Daoist army

291
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
is not the death of the Zixiang clan, right?

292
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Five hundred years have passed.

293
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
The grand master has become more brutal.

294
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
What should we do?

295
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
If we don't pacify the grand master,

296
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
the great clan that has been

297
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
subdued by the immortal immortal,

298
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm afraid it will be in our hands.

299
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Grand master!

300
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I, Shi Qian Lü,

301
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
today,

302
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I, Shi Qian Lü,

303
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
specially write the name of my disciple, Jing Shan,

304
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
to serve my grand master.

305
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Jin Er.

306
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Ni Sheng,

307
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
you are the best of all my disciples.

308
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
The hope of Tian Zhi Palace

309
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
is on you.

310
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yes, Your Highness.

311
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
The boss of the immortal world is angry.

312
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Is the staff going to bleed?

313
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'd better not go.

314
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
The kitchen.

315
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
My stuff is missing.

316
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Where did it go?

317
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
What did you lose?

318
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I'll help you find it.

319
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You're too polite.

320
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'll find it myself.

321
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Wait for me.

322
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
My stomach hurts.

323
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It hurts so much.

324
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I'm dizzy.

325
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I can't take it anymore.

326
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
My stomach.

327
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Get up and talk.

328
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It hurts.

329
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It really hurts.

330
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Alright.

331
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I won't lie down anymore.

332
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I can walk on my own.

333
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,480
Let's go inside.

334
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,620
Is the handle of our ancestors

335
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,260
so bad?

336
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,400
Master, what is the evil spirit that the shi su is cultivating?

337
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,280
Shigu, it's a little scary here.

338
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,040
Do we still have to go forward?

339
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,200
The princess told us before she came here

340
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,480
that there is a barrier in this mountain.

341
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,000
If we leave here rashly,

342
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,240
it will not only make the shi su angry,

343
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,920
but also be swallowed by the barrier.

344
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,280
If you want to live too long,

345
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,200
you can run away first.

346
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,600
Xiu'er!

347
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,360
Senior Warrior!

348
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,280
Wait!

349
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,240
Senior Fan,

350
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,440
we sent some disciples to pay our respects to shi su,

351
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,880
and came here to rebel.

352
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,760
Please lead the way .

353
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,760
No way!

354
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,200
Keep up.

355
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,480
Still keep up?

356
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,480
I'm really bold.

357
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,480
These people are too brave.

358
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,480
They can't get out and just follow a snake.

359
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,480
Luckily, the cultivation world doesn't have a big trap.

360
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,480
It's not bad to lose one.

361
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,480
I'm not afraid of them.

362
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,480
I'm not afraid of them.

363
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,480
I won't be found out.

364
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,480
What is this?

365
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,480
Demon Qi.

366
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,480
He's actually a demon.

367
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,480
Who is it? I saw you.

368
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,480
What is this?

369
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,480
I really don't know what's going on.

370
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,480
You...

371
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,480
Too dangerous.

372
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,480
Let's go back.

373
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,480
Go in.

374
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,480
In the horror film,

375
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,480
the first person to die is Luo Dan.

376
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,480
I should follow him.

377
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,480
I'm scared.

378
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,480
I'm scared.

379
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,480
I'm scared.

380
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,480
I'm scared.

381
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,480
I'm scared.

382
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,480
I'm scared.

383
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,480
This...

384
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,480
He's so tall.

385
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,480
He doesn't even have a lift.

386
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,480
I'm scared.

387
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,480
I'm scared.

388
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,480
I'm scared.

389
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,480
I'm scared.

390
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,480
I'm scared.

391
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,480
I'm scared.

392
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,480
I'm scared.

393
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,480
I'm scared.

394
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,480
I'm scared.

395
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,480
I'm scared.

396
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,480
I'm scared.

397
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,480
I'm scared.

398
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,480
I'm scared.

399
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,480
I'm scared.

400
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,480
I'm scared.

401
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,480
A bunch of ungrateful people.

402
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,480
Greetings, Grand Master.

403
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,480
Greetings, Grand Master.

404
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,480
Grand Master, I'm off.

405
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,480
Goodbye Grand Master and Clique.

406
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,480
Goodbye, Grand Master and Clique.

407
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,480
For now,

408
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,480
please safety the request and show toutement.

409
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,480
I should go back to sleep.

410
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,480
Thisictdoor's foot

411
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,360
Why am I here?

412
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,840
It's bad.

413
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,320
Why is my face white?

414
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,120
I reduced!

415
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,400
Copy that...

416
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,040
We are all women here.

417
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,240
My safety.

418
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,520
Shit.

419
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,840
Beauty.

420
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,640
Goddess, you are conceited.

421
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,600
Vice cheerleader.

422
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:32,880
Of course, I will turn you into ashes and bury you.

423
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,080
You're a match I like.

424
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,440
So I burnt the candles in my World of classes.

425
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,560
What's wrong?

426
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,360
Great!

427
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,120
What is your name?

428
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,000
Wan Ling,

429
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,160
I admire your rich rich and graceful answers from seniors.

430
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,280
She is not senior Wan Ling.

431
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,360
Who is she?

432
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,640
Someone feels so confused.

433
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,440
Why would she appear?

434
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,560
I think he's looking at me.

435
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,760
If you're not the one, then don't look at me.

436
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,160
There's someone who's even more bold.

437
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,760
How am I bold?

438
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,760
I didn't do anything wrong, Cousin.

439
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,160
Look at me.

440
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,560
Open your eyes and look at me.

441
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,160
Do you still want to play the new year?

442
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,960
You wronged me, Cousin.

443
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,960
Linghuo.

444
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,960
Get out.

445
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,160
Get out!

446
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,960
This Shisi's mental state seems to be abnormal.

447
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,960
It's totally crazy.

448
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,960
I suspect that he's looking for us

449
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,360
to feed his pet snake.

450
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,360
He's a bit fresh now.

451
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,960
Don't talk nonsense.

452
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,360
The sword has been used today.

453
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,160
We need to find a place to settle down.

454
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,360
We'll wait for the master's orders.

455
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,560
Let's go.

456
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,960
This Mu Nisheng from the Heavenly Palace

457
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,360
thinks he's someone else.

458
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,160
Everyone has to listen to him.

459
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,960
I don't.

460
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,160
Let's go this way.

461
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,960
It seems that these palace students

462
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,360
don't like me anymore.

463
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,560
That's good.

464
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,960
I won't show my face or take a risk.

465
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,560
I can be a dog for a day.

466
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,560
I've been walking for so long.

467
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,560
I feel like I'm getting soaked.

468
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,960
Si Ma Jiao actually let him off in the palace.

469
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,760
I wonder what's special about him.

470
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,560
I hope that this old man

471
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,360
doesn't have the habit of having a meeting.

472
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,360
Don't see me again.

473
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,360
It hurts.

474
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,760
Let me help you.

475
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,760
It doesn't hurt at all.

476
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,960
Thank you.

477
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,160
My name is Liao Ting Yan. How about you?

478
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,960
My name is Ye Ru Ling.

479
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,760
Ru Ling?

480
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,960
Why are you also lost?

481
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,560
Are you also a Mo Yu fan like me?

482
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,560
Mo Yu?

483
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,560
Is he talking about the Demon Citadel?

484
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,760
Which sect is the Mo Yu fan from?

485
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:38,360
It's the one who doesn't want to light up the old man.

486
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,160
I'm a disciple of Yin Zhi Palace.

487
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,160
I was ordered by the princess to serve in the mountains.

488
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,360
Why are you unwilling to light up the old man?

489
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,960
The whole Geng Chen Immortal's Manor is all

490
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,160
being nourished by the old man's spirit energy.

491
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,560
If we can get the old man's favor,

492
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,760
our cultivation will surely increase.

493
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,760
In a short time, we can overcome our thousands of years of hard work.

494
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,960
I don't have such a big wish.

495
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,760
I just want to eat and sleep well.

496
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,960
It's enough to be alive.

497
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,960
Then what are your plans for the future?

498
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,560
I plan to find a place that is full of sunlight.

499
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,160
I can also stay in a place that can be used for sunbathing during lunch break.

500
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,960
Do you want to come with me?

501
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,560
No.

502
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,160
If you need any help,

503
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,760
you can come to the back hall to find me.

504
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,760
Goodbye.

505
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,360
Thank you.

506
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,760
Liao Ting Yan?

507
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,960
Liao Ting Yan has successfully entered the mountain.

508
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,960
You are indeed the Young Palace Lord.

509
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,960
It seems that you have put in a lot of effort.

510
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,960
I have already cast a spell on her.

511
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,960
When I was choosing a weapon, I stole her spirit energy.

512
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,960
I didn't know that I would be able to defeat that Yue Chong Hui.

513
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,960
I was able to defeat her spirit energy.

514
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,960
I was able to defeat her spirit energy.

515
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,960
I was able to defeat her spirit energy.

516
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,360
I didn't know that I would be able to defeat that Yue Chong Hui.

517
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,560
Okay.

518
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,560
Once he kills Sima Jiao,

519
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,560
the barrier between the two realms will disappear.

520
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:16,360
I, Mo Yu Jue, will never be trapped in this desolate place again.

521
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:20,160
You must keep your promise.

522
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,760
Don't worry. Once Sima Jiao dies,

523
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,960
you will be able to fulfill your wish.

524
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,760
Today, I have just entered the mountain and there is a light of death.

525
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,960
With the heartless and ruthless personality of my master,

526
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,760
I fear that...

527
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,560
I fear that this will be a very easy thing to do.

528
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:41,560
Five hundred years ago, Sima Shi set a fire to burn the White Deer Cliff.

529
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,760
He destroyed the entire Sima Clan.

530
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:50,360
When I and Eight Great Masters arrived, it was a big surprise.

531
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:56,760
The Ruo Da family was able to defeat the strong Sima Jiao.

532
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,760
But he was a very rare bloodline of the mortal clan.

533
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,960
He was a different kind of spirit energy.

534
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,560
Therefore, he used his flesh and blood to provide for the spirit energy.

535
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:13,360
He ended up with Sima Jiao's death.

536
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:18,960
These bloodlines bore an endless amount of power,

537
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,560
but they also brought endless pain.

538
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,560
He was destined to become a fire-saving container when he was born.

539
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:36,560
His soul and flesh were both exhausted and he was not as good as dead.

540
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,160
In order to keep this precious bloodline,

541
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,960
they had to seal and purify it, making it impossible for him to strengthen himself.

542
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,960
He was sealed in the Three Holy Mountains.

543
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,760
He was trapped for five hundred years.

544
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,760
From the moment he was born, he was destroyed.

545
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,760
Eight Great Masters only wanted to use him to bring the spirit energy

546
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,360
and not seal him.

547
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:02,960
Grand Master, please drink this bowl of soup.

548
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,760
Drink another one.

549
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:10,160
Grand Master still remembers some of my old feelings.

550
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,760
But those disciples who were sent to the mountain by Eight Great Masters

551
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:17,360
all have their own evil intentions. I'm afraid that they will die.

552
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:21,960
He opened his eyes and looked at me.

553
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,160
Why would he let his soul be disturbed?

554
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,960
Don't let him go, Grand Master.

555
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,560
What is he planning?

556
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,160
Will he be the person I want?

557
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,160
I'm sorry.

558
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,360
I'm sorry.

559
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,560
I'm sorry.

560
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,960
I'm sorry.

561
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,160
I'm sorry.

562
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,160
I'm sorry.

563
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,360
I'm sorry.

564
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,560
I'm sorry.

565
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,760
I'm sorry.

566
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,960
I'm sorry.

567
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,160
I'm sorry.

568
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,960
I'm sorry.

569
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,960
I'm sorry.

570
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,960
The autumn breeze is light and the stars and the moon are scattered.

571
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,960
It's all about the loneliness.

572
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,960
The candlelight is dim and the shadow is shattering.

573
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,960
It's shining in the dark night.

574
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:35,960
I used my brush to paint the color of light.

575
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,960
I warmed your cold soul.

576
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,960
I heard your memories.

577
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:46,960
My yearning is clear but I can't touch it.

578
00:35:46,960 --> 00:36:01,060

I looked for the

I looked for the
