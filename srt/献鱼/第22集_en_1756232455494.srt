Episode 14

5
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Young Master Feng Qi, have a seat.

6
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Your Majesty.

7
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Demon Lord,

8
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I need to talk to you about something.

9
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Did your partner A Yan

10
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
disappear?

11
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What are the clues?

12
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Recently,

13
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
someone has been killed in Dong Cheng's soul group.

14
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I heard

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,600
The murderer has been arrested

16
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,600
and just took over the Eastern City

17
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,000
in front of the former man, Sima Jiu.

18
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,200
The soul-guards are very powerful in the Eastern City.

19
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,280
I don't know who was so arrogant

20
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,840
and just investigated it.

21
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,400
That murderer

22
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,760
should be A Yan.

23
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,080
That's right.

24
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,040
You mean

25
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,360
he was caught?

26
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,440
I sent someone to investigate it yesterday

27
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,400
and found out that

28
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,320
he was not a simple man.

29
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,400
The assassin who was trained by Sima Jiu

30
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,600
to assassinate the Demon Lord Youchi

31
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,200
is a Korean fish in the White Bone Abyss.

32
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,920
Sima Jiu

33
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,640
is extremely brutal.

34
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,320
I'm afraid

35
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,560
your partner is in danger.

36
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,200
He really is that Korean fish.

37
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,800
Yoking

38
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,000
I almost forgot

39
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,160
that the place that Jiuni

40
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,800
is Baigu Yuan.

41
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,240
I think you know

42
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,040
Han Yu.

43
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,520
So, Yan

44
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,400
is the one I've been looking for.

45
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,320
Young Master Fengqi.

46
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,440
Back then, General Chang Da

47
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,440
followed the late demon Lord Youyan

48
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,080
and was born and raised

49
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,400
for the great cause of the demon clan.

50
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,040
He raised Youchi himself.

51
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,720
He was

52
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,480
killed by a bird

53
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,760
and was sent to the Jiuyou prison.

54
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,600
You chose to live in Hexian

55
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,360
because you didn't want to

56
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,280
get involved in any power struggle.

57
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,040
Don't think about

58
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,280
fighting against Sima Jiao.

59
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,080
Should I just watch him die?

60
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,040
Young Master Fengqi,

61
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,120
you should be more open-minded.

62
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,760
Besides, he's

63
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,520
like he's forgotten

64
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,120
his Han Yu memory.

65
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,760
That's why he couldn't get along with you.

66
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,440
What a pity.

67
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,360
It's fate.

68
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,880
Yan,

69
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,320
wait for me.

70
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,520
I'll save you.

71
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,120
State Preceptor,

72
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,160
Fengqi has left for the Eastern City.

73
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,200
Good.

74
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,240
I knew he couldn't forget

75
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,440
his Han Yu memory.

76
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,120
Luckily, we didn't tell him

77
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,320
that the old Han Yu Fengqi

78
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,200
was under my order.

79
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,280
He was taken to the Jiuyou prison

80
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,320
when he was there.

81
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,600
He was just an assassin

82
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,200
who had no feelings.

83
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,320
Now,

84
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,640
with his obsession with the Han Yu,

85
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,840
he may be able to bring Liao Tingyan

86
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,360
out of Sima Jiao's life.

87
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,800
Will you

88
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,760
tell the master

89
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,760
where Liao Tingyan is?

90
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,360
Do you think he cares?

91
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,840
I'm sorry.

92
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,640
Fengqi is the most important thing now.

93
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,600
First, he's a talker.

94
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,640
When he returns,

95
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,920
he needs the help of the Chang family

96
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,720
to open the school's formation.

97
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,400
We must keep an eye on Fengqi.

98
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,320
Although he needs to

99
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,160
bring out the Han Yu,

100
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,920
we mustn't let anything happen to him.

101
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,640
Yes.

102
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,080
He doesn't need to lie to me.

103
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,600
He could have killed me.

104
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,120
The

105
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,120
The

106
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,120
The

107
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,120
The

108
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,120
The

109
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,160
Does he really have a connection with me?

110
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,560
No wonder my father

111
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,200
didn't want to restore my memory.

112
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,880
Shi Yan and Sima Jiao

113
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,600
are Luo Miao and Zhu Liye.

114
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,040
They are fated to be enemies.

115
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,240
No, no, no.

116
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,880
Sima Jiao said my surname is Liao.

117
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,680
My father said my surname is Shen.

118
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,240
Who said it was true?

119
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,920
Sister Yan, can I come in?

120
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,400
Sister Yan, I finally see you.

121
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,640
You are really like my mother.

122
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,920
So close.

123
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,600
I specially prepared new clothes for you.

124
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,840
Change your dirty clothes.

125
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,240
You are...

126
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,560
I am Zhou Yuejing,

127
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,000
Zhou Qing'er's daughter.

128
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,080
Sister Yan and Shi family

129
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,760
saved me once 18 years ago.

130
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,120
Now they say you are the closest to me.

131
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,960
Why did they say we are the closest to you?

132
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,160
Sister Yan really doesn't remember anything.

133
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,760
She doesn't remember anything.

134
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,960
I and Shi family are from the same family.

135
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,560
Shi family is like my family.

136
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,800
And sister Yan and Shi family are the same family.

137
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,320
They are my family.

138
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,880
I really think they are the same family.

139
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,720
My mother said

140
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,880
sister Yan and Shi family are the closest.

141
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,120
Do you know my name?

142
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,120
Liao Tingyan.

143
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,920
Hey, don't put that there.

144
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,880
Why do they have the same accent?

145
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,920
Is Si Ma Jiao looking for someone to lie to me?

146
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,160
What is he trying to do?

147
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,440
What do you mean?

148
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,840
Your highness.

149
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,760
The master asked us to arrange a party.

150
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,600
Do you think it's okay?

151
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,440
I'm not the master.

152
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,360
They just arranged a wedding?

153
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,280
Si Ma Jiao is going to marry me?

154
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,680
I guess so.

155
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,920
Then I need to prepare for your wedding.

156
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,880
Hurry up.

157
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,480
What is good about it?

158
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,440
If my father knows about it,

159
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,160
he will be so angry.

160
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,200
If the master knows about this,

161
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,640
I wouldn't avoid getting angry.

162
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,160
It will be my last or his.

163
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,320
Dongqi.

164
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,240
Let's go inside.

165
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,960
Isn't this the Mode Iranian she used to work for?

166
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,360
I think it's flare sistema.

167
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,880
But how mysterious.

168
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,080
The Só influence them.

169
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,920
gaze子

170
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,360
My hobby is quite tiring.

171
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,640
Didn't you say you wanted to touch the fish?

172
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,040
Go ahead.

173
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,040
I touched the fish.

174
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,120
You're too lazy.

175
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,240
You like to touch the fish,

176
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,920
but you dare to touch it when someone else catches you.

177
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,760
It seems that you don't wash it now.

178
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,160
I prepared food for you.

179
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,760
Why don't you eat it?

180
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,560
I'm not hungry.

181
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,440
You once said

182
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,200
that eating is not because of hunger,

183
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,600
but because of happiness.

184
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,760
I don't enjoy it that much.

185
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,200
I eat only to fill my stomach.

186
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,200
You're already in the period of God of War.

187
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,640
Do you still need to sleep?

188
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,840
There's no need to sleep.

189
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,240
But I want to sleep.

190
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,160
I want to sleep.

191
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,640
It's like eating.

192
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,520
There's no need to eat.

193
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,840
But I want to eat.

194
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,360
If a person can't even sleep well

195
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,360
and taste the food,

196
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,240
there must be a lot of fun in life.

197
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,440
Well,

198
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,120
why don't you eat some?

199
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,200
Are you afraid that I'll hurt my hands and feet when I eat?

200
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,120
No.

201
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,960
It's the first time I've seen someone

202
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,360
look so sad when they eat.

203
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,400
It's bad.

204
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,400
It's okay if you don't eat.

205
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,560
I'll find you a way

206
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,400
to eat more delicious food.

207
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,400
No need.

208
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,960
Greetings, City Leader.

209
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,400
Have you seen him?

210
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,880
No, I haven't.

211
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,760
But it's okay.

212
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,920
I'll definitely help you find him.

213
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,920
Brothers, find him.

214
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,560
Yes.

215
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,640
This way, please.

216
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,320
Brother,

217
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,960
did Si Ma Jiao persuade Liao Ting Yan

218
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,880
to betray us?

219
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:07,960
Otherwise,

220
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,240
why did Si Ma Jiao

221
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,640
come to you so soon?

222
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,480
Although Liao Ting Yan

223
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,560
is a lazy person,

224
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,360
he's still loyal

225
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,680
to his people.

226
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,360
Two years ago when he lost his memory,

227
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,880
I didn't let him contact anyone.

228
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,160
That's how I trained him to rely on me.

229
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,320
At that time,

230
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,360
he was like a rabbit

231
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,480
who was caught in a wolf's den.

232
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:33,960
And I

233
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,280
was the only one he could trust.

234
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,320
Although he has lost his memory now,

235
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,600
no matter how good Si Ma Jiao is to him,

236
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,400
I believe

237
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,320
he won't betray me.

238
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,120
What should we do now?

239
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,040
The whole Hexian City is looking for us.

240
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,480
It's not safe here soon.

241
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,200
Let's leave Hexian City first.

242
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,520
Then we'll discuss it in the factory.

243
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,920
Boss, it's here.

244
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,160
We found it here.

245
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,080
Search everywhere.

246
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,760
Search everywhere.

247
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,720
Yes.

248
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,320
City Leader, there's no one inside.

249
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,840
But it seems that

250
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,720
he just left not long ago.

251
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,840
It's fine. We've sealed the city.

252
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,640
Even Liang can't escape.

253
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,760
He can escape from the fire and the prison.

254
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,920
How can we seal that small gate

255
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,000
of the city?

256
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,360
What can we do?

257
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,920
The prison is so big.

258
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,200
And it's divided into five sections.

259
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,480
There are too many places to hide.

260
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,520
It's fine.

261
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,200
We have plenty of time.

262
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,920
Let's take our time.

263
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,120
Is Ting Yan

264
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,960
so simple?

265
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,320
If the City Leader knows it,

266
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,720
he'll be heartbroken.

267
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,680
Our ancestors look fierce and vicious.

268
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,080
But they're actually gentle.

269
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,240
It depends on who they are.

270
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,640
I've been with the City Leader for 400 years.

271
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,840
He's only been so gentle to one person.

272
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,640
As Y evitar쳐 the blood,

273
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,960
you also have to shoot.

274
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,560
You can ask the King

275
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,760
who is here to save you.

276
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,760
I was born alone.

277
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,760
It's been a long time.

278
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,760
I never thought about others.

279
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,760
I've paid all my attention to you.

280
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,760
But I'm still too selfish.

281
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,760
That's why you suffered these difficulties.

282
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,760
Ar other new business.

283
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,760
Stop.

284
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,760
Yuer, kill them.

285
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,640
You hand over the internal order.

286
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,800
I'll consider

287
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,600
having your father and daughter as my bodyguards.

288
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,720
Yan'er,

289
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,640
do it!

290
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,640
Please,

291
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,280
let us go.

292
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,440
Yan'er,

293
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,880
why don't you do it?

294
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,400
If you don't kill them,

295
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,120
they'll kill you.

296
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,000
I...

297
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,960
Go away!

298
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,000
Father!

299
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,520
Father!

300
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,040
Yan'er,

301
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,080
stop!

302
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,720
Do it!

303
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,800
Do it!

304
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,960
Release!

305
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,000
Kill him!

306
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,000
Come on!

307
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,760
Run!

308
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,440
I taught her to kill people.

309
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,240
God of ¿ doom

310
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,360
Yan,

311
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,880
at last!

312
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,760
This is what you deserve.

313
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,400
Shi Qianli,

314
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,480
I'll cut you into pieces at any time.

315
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,320
No!

316
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,320
No!

317
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,760
Don't kill me!

318
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,320
It's you.

319
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,720
I thought...

320
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:10,720
No.

321
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,880
I saw that he was more nervous.

322
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,320
Why do I feel relaxed?

323
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,760
Is it because the original owner's body remembers him?

324
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,840
Is it because the original owner's body remembers him?

325
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,160
The city lights

326
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,480
make love forgotten.

327
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,880
The old city is covered in fog.

328
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,760
He looks like

329
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,320
a sad cat that I have.

330
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,920
It's from Qianli.

331
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,200
Didn't you do it?

332
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,560
When we were in Mount Taiwei,

333
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,520
you set fire to burn me to death.

334
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,200
The scar left that time

335
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,480
was burnt by the fire.

336
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,600
It can't be removed.

337
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,720
If you don't refute it,

338
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,160
it seems to be true.

339
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,080
I never thought of hurting you.

340
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,360
But you did kill me.

341
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,200
The city lights

342
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,600
make love forgotten.

343
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:01,000
The old city is covered in fog.

344
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
The old city is covered in fog.

345
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
The city lights make love forgotten.

346
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
The old city is covered in fog.

347
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
The city lights make love forgotten.

348
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
The city lights make love forgotten.

349
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
The city lights

350
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
make love forgotten.

351
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
The city lights make love forgotten.

352
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
In the past years,

353
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I often woke up in dream.

354
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
But in the dream,

355
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I could never hear your voice.

356
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
The city lights make love forgotten.

357
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Then I knew

358
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
The most terrifying thing is not death itself,

359
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
but the farewell he brought.

360
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I'm sorry.

361
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I don't think we're really close.

362
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
What's this box?

363
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
It's a gift for you.

364
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Thank you.

365
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
It's quite special.

366
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
For me?

367
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I made this bracelet myself.

368
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Do you like it?

369
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
It's a gift for you.

370
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Thank you.

371
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Is this bracelet used to trap me?

372
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
It's used to protect you.

373
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
What's the barrier outside?

374
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
That's right.

375
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
There's no need for the barrier outside.

376
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
This defensive bracelet can resist the harm that everyone brings to you.

377
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Everyone?

378
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Including you?

379
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
But...

380
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Linghuo can burn anything.

381
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
What defensive weapon can resist Linghuo's burn?

382
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
It can...

383
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
What happened 18 years ago...

384
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
will never happen again.

385
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Then I can leave in peace.

386
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Thank you.

387
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I know you're willing to believe me.

388
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Does he love the original owner of my body too much?

389
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Your wound hasn't healed yet?

390
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Not worth mentioning.

391
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
80.

392
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
80.

393
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
80.

394
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
80.

395
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
80.

396
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
80.

397
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
80.

398
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
80.

399
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Chengzhu, you're here.

400
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Why don't you take me in to have a rest?

401
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
You wait here.

402
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I'll be back soon.

403
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
How's the drink?

404
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I'll be right back.

405
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Chengzhu,

406
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I'm sorry.

407
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I'm sorry.

408
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I'm sorry.

409
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I'm sorry.

410
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I'll be back soon.

411
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Chengzhu.

412
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Chengzhu.

413
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Chengzhu.

414
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Chengzhu.

415
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
What are you doing?

416
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Chengzhu, welcome.

417
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
We're here to welcome you.

418
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Where's the girl who was dancing with you last time?

419
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
You mean Hongluo?

420
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Didn't she get locked up by your two men?

421
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
The two bastards in the Soul-seeking City.

422
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
The girl who killed them.

423
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Yes.

424
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
That day,

425
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Miss Hongluo wanted to see you.

426
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
But she was framed.

427
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Why did she want to see me?

428
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
She wanted to know you.

429
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
She said you were her destiny.

430
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Destiny?

431
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Do you have her portrait here?

432
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Ruoling.

433
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Chengzhu, what did you call her?

434
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
You know her?

435
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I said, this girl is so pitiful.

436
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
When I picked her up,

437
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
her body was badly injured.

438
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
She didn't remember anything.

439
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
There was only one long hand left.

440
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
In order to cure her,

441
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I had to use my own hands.

442
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I had to use my own hands.

443
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I had to use my own hands.

444
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
In order to cure her,

445
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I spent so much time in the bedroom.

446
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
But...

447
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Long hand.

448
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Where did you find her?

449
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
In the Yinyang Lake.

450
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I haven't slept so comfortably for a long time.

451
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I haven't slept so comfortably for a long time.

452
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Oh my god.

453
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Why did I sleep so late in the enemy camp?

454
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
But I don't have to be forced to

455
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
take the risk and take revenge.

456
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
It's so nice.

457
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Did you have a nightmare?

458
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
No.

459
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I barely slept until dawn.

460
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
In the past,

461
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
it was normal to relax.

462
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Now,

463
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
it's hard to sleep.

464
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Sister Yan,

465
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
have a taste.

466
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Why does it taste like

467
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
the sauce of Hexian City?

468
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
The one I often eat with Hongluo.

469
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
It's really the one.

470
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
You like this?

471
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I usually eat it.

472
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
It looks very familiar.

473
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Bi Yan.

474
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Do you remember

475
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
the cook who made this?

476
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Yes.

477
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Is he reliable?

478
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
The one who brought it into the mansion

479
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
was checked by Brother Nianjiu.

480
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I'll show it to the crown prince.

481
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I feel like I've stolen

482
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
my boyfriend.

483
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
But I can't say

484
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I'm here to travel.

485
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
What kind of bloody script is this?

486
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
What if Si Ma Jiao finds out the truth

487
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
and is afraid that I'll be killed?

488
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Actually,

489
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
you don't have to find me a cook.

490
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I'll leave with him

491
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
after Hongluo is revived.

492
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I won't bother you.

493
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Where are you going?

494
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Go back to Shi Qianli.

495
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Although you have a grudge against him,

496
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Dan Dan is my father.

497
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I'm going to take him and Hongluo

498
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
to find a good place

499
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
to live a good life

500
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
and not appear in front of you.

501
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Where is the good place you said?

502
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
It's not convenient to tell you.

503
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
After all, you're my father's enemy.

504
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
It seems that in the future you imagine,

505
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I've never had a place to go.

506
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
It's mainly because

507
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
our relationship is a little awkward now.

508
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I don't remember

509
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
the past.

510
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Although we eat and drink well here,

511
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
it's just awkward.

512
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
How about we

513
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
say goodbye to each other

514
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
and be safe?

515
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
You forgot about the past.

516
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
It doesn't matter.

517
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Where do you want to go?

518
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I can take you there.

519
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I'm not going.

520
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I can take you there.

521
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I can go where I want to go.

522
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I'm grateful that you treat me well.

523
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
But my experiment

524
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
is no longer the Liao Tingye in your memory.

525
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Can you understand?

526
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I won't be wrong.

527
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
You don't understand.

528
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Master, Sister Yan,

529
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I brought the cook.

530
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Greetings, Master.

531
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Our Lady asked you to stay.

532
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Thank her.

533
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Thank you for the food.

534
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Lady?

535
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
The bamboo flute you like

536
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
is made by secret magic.

537
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
If you're interested,

538
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I'll show you how to make it.

539
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Thank you.

540
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I can tell you

541
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
how to make it.

542
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I'm really interested.

543
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I want to discuss with you.

544
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Then I won't waste your time.

545
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Please.

546
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
How do you know I'm here?

547
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
It's easy to know where you are.

548
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
How is it?

549
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Is it interesting?

550
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I've come all the way to find you.

551
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
You're too adventurous.

552
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
What if I don't eat the food you cook?

553
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
You won't come for free.

554
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
How many years have we known each other?

555
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I don't know what you like to eat.

556
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
We have a tacit understanding.

557
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
So confident.

558
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Eat quickly.

559
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Come with me after you finish eating.

560
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I want to wait for the silk horse glue to revive the red gourd.

561
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
It can revive the red gourd?

562
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
It can revive the red gourd?

563
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Why is it so similar?

564
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I think

565
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:38,780
it was its

566
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
hair.

567
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
It's gone.

568
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Then, as the silk horse glue said,

569
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I was its hair before I lost my memory.

570
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Then the scar on your face

571
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
was also cured by it.

572
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Is it completely cured?

573
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Yan.

574
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Do you stay

575
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
for the red gourd

576
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
or do you also want the silk horse glue to be good to you?

577
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
It's good to me

578
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
and to the old me.

579
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
How can I be so narcissistic?

580
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
You can figure it out.

581
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
That's enough.

582
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I'm going to sleep.

583
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I'm going to sleep.

584
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I'm going to sleep.

585
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I'm going to sleep.

586
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I'm going to sleep.

587
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I'm going to sleep.

588
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I'm going to sleep.

589
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I'm going to sleep.

590
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
That's enough.

591
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I'll think of a way

592
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
to take you and the red gourd with me.

593
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Who sent you here?

594
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Do you know him?

595
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I not only know him,

596
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
but also eat and sleep together,

597
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
share the trouble

598
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
and share the trouble.

599
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
It's an inseparable relationship.

600
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
What are you talking about?

601
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Don't make trouble.

602
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
You're annoying.

603
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Wait a minute.

604
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Let me introduce.

605
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Yan.

606
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
He's Feng Qi. He's my friend.

607
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Didn't you tell me

608
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
you only have one friend, the red gourd?

609
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
It's different.

610
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Red gourd is a girlfriend.

611
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Feng Qi?

612
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Boyfriend.

613
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Do you know what boyfriend means?

614
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
You told me before.

615
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
That's impossible.

616
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Is he

617
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
or not?

618
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
He's not a boyfriend.

619
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Get out of here.

620
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I'll spare your life.

621
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Feng Qi.

622
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I won't leave him even if I die.

623
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
You're so insolent.

624
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
You want to die?

625
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I...

626
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Wait.

627
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Don't make trouble.

628
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Why are you here?

629
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Leave now.

630
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I'm fine here.

631
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I came here

632
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
without any plan to leave.

633
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Otherwise,

634
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
you can kill me in front of him

635
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
and see if you can

636
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
win his heart.

637
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Don't touch him.

638
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Or I'll really

639
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
treat you as my enemy.

640
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I'll kill you.

641
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I'll kill you.

642
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
You're overreacting.

643
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
You're overreacting.

644
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
What are you doing?

645
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I'm going to kill you.

646
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Don't kill me.

647
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I'm going to kill you.

648
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Feng Qi.

649
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Feng Qi.

650
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Feng Qi.

651
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Feng Qi.

652
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Feng Qi.

653
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Feng Qi.

654
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Feng Qi.

655
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Feng Qi.

656
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Feng Qi.

657
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,140
Yan.

658
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,080
Don't believe her firmly.

659
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,740
The one who chose Mr. Lu

660
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,000
to die is the best of various military service.

661
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:13,960
Still better than the one

662
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,260
you died witness-hなing...!

663
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,480
What were you doing just now?

664
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,360
Were you...

665
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,320
Tell me,

666
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,400
are you still missing

667
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,560
that rescue lady?

668
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,440
That's right.

669
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,800
I'm sorry.

670
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,760
and be my friend.

671
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,240
That's good.

672
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,480
I thought you...

673
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,120
You said you had to pretend

674
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,680
to be my friend.

675
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,000
Aren't you afraid that he'll kill you?

676
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:52,800
I...

677
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,160
I just can't get used to

678
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,400
his self-righteousness.

679
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,480
It's a good thing that Sima Jiao

680
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,720
isn't as bad as the legend.

681
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,600
Otherwise, you would have died a hundred times.

682
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,520
You think he's good enough?

683
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,080
Did Sima Jiao

684
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,280
do something to you?

685
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,720
No.

686
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,800
But he's indeed

687
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,160
quite different from the legend.

688
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,440
He's not only not scary,

689
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,080
but also very considerate.

690
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,840
He's like a kitten.

691
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,600
He looks proud,

692
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,720
but he's actually

693
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,240
always paying attention to your needs.

694
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,160
He might be a soft-hearted person.

695
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,440
I plan to take him and Hongluo

696
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,440
to a good place

697
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,280
and live a good life.

698
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,000
I won't show up in front of you.

699
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,680
It's just that our relationship

700
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,720
is a little awkward now.

701
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,240
I don't remember

702
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,200
what happened in the past.

703
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,760
How about we

704
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:04,960
part ways

705
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,360
and be safe?

706
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,840
Sure.

707
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,680
I'm grateful that you treat me well.

708
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,240
But my experiment

709
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,280
is no longer the Liao Ting Yan

710
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,640
you remember.

711
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,280
The autumn breeze is light and the stars and the moon are bright.

712
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,280
It's all because of the deep loneliness.

713
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,280
The candlelight is dim.

714
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,120
The moon is bright.

715
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,880
The moon is dim.

716
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,600
The moon is bright.

717
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,200
The moon is dim.

718
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,840
The moon is bright.

719
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,680
The moon is bright.

720
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,320
The moon is bright.

721
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,680
The moon is bright.

722
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,000
The moon is bright.

723
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,280
The moon is bright.

724
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,480
The moon is bright.

725
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,800
The moon is bright.

726
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,120
The moon is bright.

727
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,400
The moon is bright.

728
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,800
The moon is bright.

729
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,120
The moon is bright.

730
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,600
The moon is bright.

731
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,000
The moon is bright.

732
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,400
The moon is bright.

733
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,800
The moon is bright.

734
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,000
The moon is bright.

735
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,400
The moon is bright.

736
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,720
The moon is bright.

737
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,120
The moon is bright.

738
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,520
The moon is bright.

739
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,920
The moon is bright.

740
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,320
The moon is bright.

741
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,720
The moon is bright.

742
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,120
The moon is bright.

743
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,520
The moon is bright.

744
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,920
The moon is bright.

745
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,320
The moon is bright.

746
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,720
The moon is bright.

747
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,120
The moon is bright.

748
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,520
The moon is bright.

749
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,920
The moon is bright.

750
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,320
The moon is bright.

751
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,720
The moon is bright.

752
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,120
The moon is bright.

753
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,720
The moon is bright.

754
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,320
The moon is bright.

755
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,920
The moon is bright.

756
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,320
The moon is bright.

757
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,720
The moon is bright.

758
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,320
The moon is bright.

759
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,720
The moon is bright.

760
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,320
The moon is bright.

761
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,720
The moon is bright.

762
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,120
The moon is bright.

763
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,720
The moon is bright.

764
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,320
The moon is bright.

765
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,920
The moon is bright.

766
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,520
The moon is bright.

767
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,520
Only I

768
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,520
will ever erase the past.

769
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,720
Right or wrong

770
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,720
is the story of the message.

771
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:17,320
I will never

772
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,720
let go of my fate.

773
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,720
For you,

774
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,720
for me,

775
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:29,720
for the peace in the world,

776
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,720
the sea is warm

777
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,720
and the rain is heavy.

778
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:37,720
It's all because of me.

779
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,720
For you,

780
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,720
for me,

781
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:45,720
for the sincerity in my heart,

782
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,720
when I face the promise,

783
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,720
it's like flying.

784
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:54,720
I will light up my life

785
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:00,720
with you.
