OST credit

3
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,700
♫  Let the heavens release a mighty thunder tribulation  ♫

4
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,420
♫  Leading mountains and rivers so mighty and vast to shatter before my eyes  ♫

5
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,600
♫  Lifetimes of cultivation bring years of splendor   ♫

6
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,340
♫  Yet turn to dust between fingers in an instant  ♫

7
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,220
♫  When immortals and demons discern good and evil with a single thought  ♫

8
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,140
♫  Many souls escape into the endless wilderness  ♫

9
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,500
♫  I journey forward with the Spirit Fire in my veins  ♫

10
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,880
♫  I defy fate just to remain by your side  ♫

11
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,860
♫  Falling thousands of feet in love is like heavy rain,   ♫

12
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,660
♫  Pouring down between heaven and earth  ♫

13
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:08,460
♫  Drunk in love,   ♫

14
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,400
♫  Love and hate vanish in an instant  ♫

15
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,260
♫  Falling into an endless abyss of love,   ♫

16
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,400
♫  Stirring waves upending a lifetime  ♫

17
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,720
♫  Even if this life leads to ruin  ♫

18
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,980
♫  I'd still choose to be entangled with you  ♫

19
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:30,225
♫  Through all lifetimes  ♫

20
00:01:30,225 --> 00:01:36,540
 

21
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,472
 

22
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,080
Boss, where are we going?

23
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,830
To kill someone.

24
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,280
Can we not go?

25
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,670
What do you think?

26
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,980
Who's that?

27
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,290
Who's that?

28
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,440
That swagger beats even the Eight Palaces.

29
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,750
- He may be some top disciple?
- Ignore him.

30
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,870
Smells so good!

31
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,830
Eat whatever you want.

32
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,240
Then I won't hold back.

33
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,670
Boss, didn't you say
we're going to kill someone?

34
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,540
Why are we having a company meal?

35
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,670
I mean just hanging out over food and drinks.

36
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,750
Weren't you hungry?

37
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,120
How did you know?

38
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,360
Your swallowing just now was too loud.

39
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:18,240
 So, he brought me here to eat just because I was craving food? 

40
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,280
Thanks, Boss.

41
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:50,150
 Didn't know the Grandmaster
could be thoughtful, too. 

42
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,870
 Guess he's not as scary as he looks. 

43
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,590
Can you even afford that?

44
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,630
Please, calm down.

45
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,240
For you minor branches...

46
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,730
I think I heard my master's voice.

47
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,670
Being invited to Heaven Palace's flower banquet
is already a blessing.

48
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,830
Yet you still dare be so blind!

49
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:05,990
Insolent!

50
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,890
Serene Vale may be small and unknown,

51
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,590
but my master is still the head of a sect.

52
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,870
- How dare you insult him! 
 - Bai Zhu...

53
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,510
Master!

54
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,150
It really is you!

55
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,320
Senior.

56
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,520
Ting Yan!

57
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,470
What, calling for backup now?

58
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,000
Master, Junior, what's going on?

59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,880
Senior, a Heaven Palace disciple got drunk,

60
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,320
bumped into our master, spilled the Spirit Dew,

61
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,710
and accused Master of doing it!

62
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,560
Who's drunk?

63
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,250
It's just a jar of wine. I'll pay you.

64
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,940
- How much is it?
- The Spirit Dew's worth a hundred gems.

65
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,930
Well... I'll pay in installments.

66
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,960
Nonsense! You little brat!

67
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,080
Trying to mess with me?

68
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,400
You must have a death wish!

69
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,030
What's going on?

70
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,560
Who is that? Such high cultivation.

71
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,320
Boss! Grandmaster!

72
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,910
It really is Grandmaster!

73
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,130
I saw him when I followed Master to greet the Lord of Mercy.

74
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,650
- Greetings, Grandmaster!
- Greetings, Grandmaster!

75
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,870
Ting Yan, bow now!

76
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:46,880
Seeing you out of the mountain safely

77
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,080
puts my mind at ease.

78
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:52,910
When I saw Grandmaster end so many lives,

79
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,300
I feared you'd...

80
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,320
Now the whole Gengchen Celestial Palace says

81
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,510
Grandmaster dotes on you.

82
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,590
Is that true?

83
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,070
No.

84
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:07,120
Grandmaster and I have no such romance.

85
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,220
Then why does he treat you so well,

86
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,570
even protecting you in public?

87
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,860
Maybe I help him pass the time?

88
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,100
I only fear you're lazy,
slow-witted, and awkward.

89
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,860
Master, you really know how to insult someone.

90
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,910
What if you really anger Grandmaster

91
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,290
and he takes your life?

92
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,270
Better find a chance to resign

93
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,940
and return to Serene Vale to cultivate.

94
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,420
Grandmaster.

95
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,020
Grandmaster.

96
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,350
You sent Liao Ting Yan to serve me,

97
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:59,590
yet you make decisions for me without asking?

98
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:03,170
Forgive me, Grandmaster. I wouldn't dare.

99
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,830
Grandmaster, my master didn't mean that.

100
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,960
Or do you want a reward?

101
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,380
I dare not accept.

102
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,880
Say it. What reward do you want?

103
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,000
I beg you, Grandmaster.

104
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,390
If Ting Yan ever serves you poorly,

105
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,880
please be lenient and spare her life!

106
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,040
Master...

107
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,650
Not allowed.

108
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,270
But I can grant you four spirit veins.

109
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,270
That many?

110
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:48,290
- Four spirit veins!
- Yeah!

111
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,340
All at once?

112
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,440
Truly, when one rises, all rise with them.

113
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,990
This tiny Serene Vale may soon catch up to Moon Palace.

114
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,270
Thank you for the reward, Grandmaster!

115
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:04,880
More spirit veins don't always mean more power.

116
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,830
Take White Deer Cliff's spirit vein.

117
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,550
It's not a blessing for you.

118
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,040
Its spiritual energy is overwhelming.

119
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,470
What do you mean by that, Grandmaster?

120
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:20,270
For the Sima clan,
White Deer Cliff's vein is medicine.

121
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:24,980
For others, it's poison.

122
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,270
If outsiders cultivate with it,

123
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,880
the higher their realm, the greater the danger.

124
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,200
At the Unity Merge stage,

125
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,990
once you channel it,

126
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,160
you'll die instantly.

127
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:50,230
- Master, don't worry.  
 - Grandmaster...- Farewell, Grandmaster!

128
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,040
 So, Sima Jiao really has feelings
for Liao Ting Yan. 

129
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,990
 Yet she neither tries to kill him 

130
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,200
 nor expose my identity. 

131
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,980
 What's her game? 

132
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:14,370
Boss, I can't cultivate,
but lately my body's changed.

133
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:18,580
Maybe it's from absorbing
White Deer Cliff's energy.

134
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,890
Will anything happen to me?

135
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,220
Probably.

136
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,490
I'll be in danger?

137
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,340
Then... will I die?

138
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:40,460
You're still far from Unity Merge.

139
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,680
That's good.

140
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,630
I have no talent for cultivation.

141
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,530
Guess being weak has its perks.

142
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,230
We're going back.

143
00:09:53,230 --> 00:10:00,540
Boss, didn't you say
we're going to kill someone?

144
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,200
Yeah, but you just ate so much.

145
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,470
If you puke at the sight of blood,
it'll ruin my mood.

146
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:13,250
 Is he caring about me? 

147
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,460
 Like at the flower banquet, 

148
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:19,520
 he cared about me and even my folks. 

149
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,400
 I finally get it now. 

150
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,080
 The Grandmaster's all sharp tongue, soft heart. 

151
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,630
 He shouldn't be called Sima Jiao. 

152
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:31,150
 It should be Sima Sweetie! 

153
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,750
Why are you laughing?

154
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:41,680
I was just thinking how considerate
you are to your subordinates.

155
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,150
My gratitude to you is like...

156
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,400
 

157
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,750
Sima Jiao claims that vein's like poison.

158
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,510
Master, what's your current realm?

159
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:00,230
I reached Unity Merge just yesterday.

160
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,960
Have you channeled it yet?

161
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,680
Thankfully, no.

162
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,230
Could it be...

163
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,110
Sima Jiao is bluffing?

164
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,840
If he knew we took White Deer Cliff's vein and cultivated in secret,

165
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,920
why wouldn't he just kill us?

166
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,350
When he ended his seclusion,
blood flowed everywhere.

167
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,920
He didn't hesitate.

168
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,230
Even the Sima clan's Bloodseal Bloom

169
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:29,610
must be taken with Fengshan blood.

170
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:34,410
So, it's no surprise
about White Deer Cliff's vein.

171
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,870
Master, what should we do now?

172
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:43,600
Lately, several high-level disciples have entered Void Forge.

173
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,770
If this is true, they may soon show reactions.

174
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:54,770
Should we warn them
not to use the vein for now?

175
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,620
No need.

176
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:04,580
Keep them calm. Don't spread it.

177
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:08,630
If Sima Jiao's right,

178
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:14,210
they can serve as my test subjects.

179
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,770
Grandmaster!

180
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,870
Grandmaster, what brings you here?

181
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,440
I'll go get the Master!

182
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:56,553
 

183
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,940
Master, these past few days,
several disciples in our palace

184
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,750
have gone mad during cultivation,

185
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,160
ending up mad and senseless.

186
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,240
All of them were among
the most powerful in centuries,

187
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,980
already at the Void Forge stage.

188
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,770
Once at Void Forge,
the next stage is Unity Merge.

189
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:25,220
Looks like Sima Jiao was right.

190
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,630
What should we do now?

191
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:32,660
I'm going to find Sect Master Shi!

192
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,010
Why be so formal?

193
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:40,630
Sect Master Shi, the Shi clan
has served Grandmaster for generations.

194
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:44,710
I fear only you can save me now.

195
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:51,060
Master Tian, we're close friends.

196
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,610
I'll definitely help you!

197
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:57,960
Go back and wait for news.

198
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,870
I'll head to White Deer Cliff right away.

199
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:04,470
Thank you, sir!

200
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,560
Where's Tian Wu Ya?

201
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,440
He visited Shi Qian Lv early this morning.

202
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,990
Tian Wu Ya really is Shi Qian Lv's loyal dog.

203
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:15,250
That old fox will surely come beg for him.

204
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,490
So, are we going to meet Shi Qian Lv?

205
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:22,160
I have no interest in trading riddles
with that old man.

206
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,510
- Let's go.
- Let's bring Ting Yan along.

207
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,990
She's a Demon Realm spy,

208
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:33,230
yet more upright
than the Celestial Palace crowd.

209
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,560
She can't stand blood either
and just gets in the way.

210
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,380
Grandmaster, actually...

211
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,090
I'm also scared of seeing corpses.

212
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,510
You've followed me for hundreds of years,

213
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,870
and you can't see through
such a simple illusion?

214
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,700
Illusion?

215
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:57,350
So, those Heaven Palace disciples
never truly went mad?

216
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:02,990
You created that scene to frighten Tian Wu Ya?

217
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,210
Guards!

218
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,390
Anyone here?

219
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,830
Are you insane?

220
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,940
If you hadn't stolen White Deer Cliff's vein,

221
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,470
we wouldn't be in this mess!

222
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,760
How dare you slander and threaten me?

223
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,590
Grandmaster, spare my life!

224
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,680
It's too late.

225
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,510
Sima Jiao, you've gone too far!

226
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,920
Trying to beat me with mortal techniques?

227
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,870
You stole my vein and cultivated with it.

228
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:38,480
Your realm now must be close to mine.

229
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,830
If you channeled your power to fight back,

230
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,750
you may at least trade blows with me.

231
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,010
Why won't you?

232
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,830
Oh, you have a guilty conscience.

233
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,730
You are afraid the backlash will kill you.

234
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:57,770
What'll make you spare me?

235
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,440
Do it yourself.

236
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,970
If I'm satisfied, I'll spare you.

237
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,540
I was wrong.

238
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,860
Please spare me!

239
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,990
Satisfied now?

240
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:36,470
You really are soft on yourself.

241
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,880
Too bad...

242
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,400
White Deer Cliff's vein is fine.

243
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,200
Really?

244
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,440
One test will tell.

245
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,160
You'd rather waste your cultivation

246
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,360
than risk a real fight?

247
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,370
Then why should I keep you alive?

248
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,500
I'm fine?

249
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,890
Sima Jiao, you're playing me!

250
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:32,920
 Let's add another restriction to this seal, 

251
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,310
 one that links to all his meridians. 

252
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:44,470
 That way, he can't kill himself
no matter the pain. 

253
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,640
Do you still remember this?

254
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,020
You... you mean to...

255
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,370
Repay you in your own coin.

256
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:59,650
Grandmaster, I don't have
Spirit Fire protection.

257
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,920
If I suffer this nail torture, I may die!

258
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,600
Just because I'm powerful,

259
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,650
I should endure 500 years of this?

260
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,760
 What did I do to deserve this? 

261
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,150
 ♫ Rewrite the starry tides of time ♫ 

262
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:24,940
 ♫ Dye the moon and sky in crimson light ♫ 

263
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,270
 ♫ We'll shatter destined paths ♫ 

264
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,320
 ♫ Through illusion's trials ♫ 

265
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,070
 ♫ Awaken silent souls to tremble ♫ 

266
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,660
 ♫ Transform our parting's elegy ♫ 

267
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:40,740
 ♫ Strength bows to nature's law alone ♫ 

268
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,460
 ♫ So what if we perish? ♫ 

269
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,610
Tian Wu Ya is dead?

270
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:53,170
Sima Jiao, you're utterly disrespecting me!

271
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:56,450
I waited at White Deer Cliff for half the day,

272
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,440
and he never showed.

273
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,030
He knew full well I came
to plead for Tian Wu Ya,

274
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:06,070
yet he killed him without a word!

275
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,880
Tian Wu Ya has always been
on good terms with us.

276
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,270
Now we couldn't even protect his life.

277
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,230
If the other palace heads know this,

278
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,550
they'll doubt our ability to quell unrest.

279
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:18,590
They may not follow your orders in the future.

280
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,860
Sima Jiao's intent behind this incident isn't that simple.

281
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,680
He's sending a warning.

282
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,710
Maybe...

283
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,860
he's noticed our plan?

284
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,790
If he really has, not just the Shi clan,

285
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:47,720
the entire Gengchen Celestial Palace will be destroyed by him!

286
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,190
I think...

287
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,490
he still doesn't know.

288
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:59,400
Grandmaster, Shi Qian Lv is summoning
the other palace heads.

289
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,260
Looks like he couldn't hold back after all.

290
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,310
But with Tian Wu Ya dead,

291
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:07,070
it's too soon to appoint a new palace head.

292
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,970
Why's he gathering them now?

293
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:13,120
Either to seal me or kill me.

294
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,250
Same tricks as always.

295
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,370
If he tries to seal me,

296
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:22,880
then his cultivation must be terrifying.

297
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,120
If he tries to kill me...

298
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,200
How will he dare lay a hand on you?

299
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,640
Gengchen Celestial Palace
now depends on your Spirit Fire.

300
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,640
If he kills you, he can't cultivate anymore.

301
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,680
If he tries to kill me,

302
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,970
then his real motive gets interesting.

303
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:49,610
You've all heard what happened
with Master Tian.

304
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,920
Grandmaster is far too ruthless.

305
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,430
He killed a palace head just like that.

306
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:01,160
I thought he only killed
enemies like Yin Liu Nian.

307
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:06,510
But now it seems we've underestimated his mad, violent nature.

308
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,530
Since he killed Tian Wu Ya,

309
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:13,350
that means he still holds a grudge

310
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,550
over the last generation's seal.

311
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,790
Then we should strike first,

312
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:22,220
restart the sealing array, and bind him.

313
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,710
Tian Wu Ya is dead.

314
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:28,580
The new palace head still lacks influence.

315
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,580
Do the few of us have enough power?

316
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:36,310
Grandmaster's been cruel

317
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,740
and bloodthirsty since childhood.

318
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:42,655
I once thought to reform him.

319
00:22:42,655 --> 00:22:48,200
But now it's clear he's beyond saving.

320
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,552
Fine.

321
00:22:49,552 --> 00:22:55,760
If that's the case,
I'll lend my strength this time.

322
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,613
Good.

323
00:22:57,613 --> 00:23:00,120
With Sect Master Shi's help,

324
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,510
it's no difficult task.

325
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,890
Does everyone agree?

326
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,690
Madam Ye?

327
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,710
 If Sima Jiao is sealed, 

328
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:22,330
 I'll have an even harder time killing him. 

329
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:26,230
Master Yuan of Four Seasons Palace,

330
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:29,320
you seem to have something to say?

331
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,600
I think we should think this over.

332
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,060
If we hastily activate the sealing array,

333
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,930
we'll both suffer heavy losses.

334
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:39,680
My disciples may all be wiped out.

335
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,880
Is that price worth it?

336
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,920
All of us have drunk Sima blood.

337
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,070
He won't let it go.

338
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:49,170
Tian Wu Ya is proof of that.

339
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:52,600
I have never drunk Sima blood.

340
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:57,030
But that doesn't mean your ancestors never did.

341
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,160
You think Grandmaster will spare you?

342
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,640
How did Tian Wu Ya die?

343
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,840
He stole the spirit vein,

344
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,840
so Grandmaster punished him.

345
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,020
If no one harbored ill intent,

346
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:12,690
he might not have bothered.

347
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,020
I understand now.

348
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:18,270
Master Yuan, that young disciple of yours

349
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:22,130
has caught Grandmaster's eye,
so you're hesitating, aren't you?

350
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:24,120
Ridiculous.

351
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,470
Grandmaster, it's just as you predicted.

352
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:42,020
Shi Qian Lv gathered the other palace heads to discuss sealing you.

353
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,790
Only Four Seasons Palace's master refused,

354
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:47,170
the rest agreed to his plan.

355
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:49,020
However...

356
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,840
Ru Ling hasn't taken a side.

357
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,740
Four Seasons Palace...

358
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,930
 Forgive me, Grandmaster! 

359
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,370
Well, that's new.

360
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:01,200
One smart one among the Eight Palaces.

361
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,360
By your earlier guess,

362
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,600
Shi Qian Lv's cultivation is now high enough.

363
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,600
To replace Tian Wu Ya in the sealing ritual,

364
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,310
he'll need at least Unity Merge mastery.

365
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,160
Perhaps he's even achieved Grand Ascend.

366
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,450
So, he's on par with you now?

367
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:25,230
He's not worthy to compare with me.

368
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:31,750
Shi Qian Lv will likely exploit
Yuan Che's weakness for his own ends.

369
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:36,020
I never paid much attention to him before.

370
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,920
Find out what his soft spot is.

371
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,790
Understood.

372
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:45,640
 Let's see who will win this round. 

373
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,440
Father, Yuan Che is so stubborn.

374
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,550
He must be the type who fears death.

375
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,970
Looks like we'll need some leverage.

376
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,790
You underestimate him.

377
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:58,750
When Grandmaster returned,
he vanished like a ghost.

378
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,840
He's extremely cautious.

379
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:06,600
Now that his disciple Liao Ting Yan has Sima Jiao's trust,

380
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,970
he'll be even less willing to offend him.

381
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,160
If we want him to turn,

382
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,310
we'll have to hit where it hurts.

383
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:22,880
Doesn't he have a son named Yuan Shang?

384
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,410
The damage to his spirit root
crushed all his ambition.

385
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:33,310
Yuan Che's worried himself sick over him.

386
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,750
Well, I'll find a chance to kill Yuan Shang

387
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:38,130
and blame it on Sima Jiao.

388
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,820
You want him dead?

389
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,500
Well, I won't say no.

390
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:03,980
Thanks. Just leave it there.

391
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:13,240
Let's see what great dishes we have today.

392
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:29,600
Such girly colors, with a faint floral scent.

393
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,540
Could it be a love letter?

394
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,270
Small seal script. Luckily, I can read it.

395
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:42,750
"White Deer Cliff at midnight."

396
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:46,440
"By the Blue Lumina Blossoms. I'll be waiting."

397
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,920
No signature?

398
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,210
Who knows who wrote it.

399
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,230
Could it be Sima Jiao?

400
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:58,920
Coming to see me again tonight?

401
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,230
No way.

402
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:04,990
Pink perfumed paper?

403
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:08,680
That clueless tough guy? Not a chance.

404
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,750
This tone...

405
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:20,340
Could it be this body's old lover?

406
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,710
No way. I can't show up.

407
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:31,470
Dealing with one unstable boss
is headache enough.

408
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:33,920
I don't need an ex on top of that.

409
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,790
It's already 3 A.M.

410
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:52,880
Liao Ting Yan dares to ignore me
time and again?

411
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,730
Fine, don't blame me for what happens next!

412
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,470
Oh my...

413
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,500
Another attack?

414
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:17,360
It hurts... Help!

415
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,250
No one's there...

416
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:20,000
I have to find Grandmaster...

417
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,350
Or I'm done for...

418
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,920
Where's he?

419
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,400
Grandmaster...

420
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,450
 This is Grandmaster's private space. 

421
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:51,990
 Back at Three Saints Mountain,
Mr. Snake snuck me in. 

422
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,200
 This time I came on my own... 

423
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,750
 Once is enough, not twice. 

424
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:58,860
 What if he gets angry? 

425
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,070
 It hurts so much... 

426
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,300
Wake up.

427
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,890
Wake up!

428
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,710
 My blood should've already
suppressed the poison. 

429
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:32,600
 Maybe what's in her
isn't ordinary demonic poison? 

430
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,090
 Isn't she a Demon Realm spy? 

431
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:38,120
 Why does it keep backfiring on her? 

432
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,550
Open your mouth.

433
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,120
Bite.

434
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,070
Bite!

435
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,370
 Not too forceful, not too gentle. 

436
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:04,250
 Saving someone is harder than killing them. 

437
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:09,200
 ♫ Endless splendor

The few I saved were all for you.

00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:12,510
Yet you're so useless.

455
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:15,410
You can't even handle my bloodline.

 Where am I? 

463
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:57,500
 So cold... and so dark around me. 

464
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:06,090
 Isn't this Grandmaster's Bloodseal Bloom? 

465
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,491
 

466
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:40,020
 I haven't felt this relaxed in ages. 

467
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,170
 Did I sleep in the wrong place, 

468
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:06,260
 or did Boss grab the wrong pillow? 

469
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,290
 Why is it so noisy outside? 

470
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:18,470
Feels like I suddenly gained
super-vision and super-hearing!

471
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:21,030
Like I can move mountains and seas with a wave.

472
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:25,650
Boss, I think I got stronger... Grandmaster?

473
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,400
Grandmaster?

474
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,650
Still alive. He scared me to death.

475
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,980
 I can't imagine how he endured
500 years like this. 

476
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,700
 This wound is new. 

477
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:09,330
Last night, my stomach hurt so bad.

478
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,950
 It hurts so much... 

479
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:15,400
 ♫ You, untouched by the moon's regrets ♫ 

480
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,670
You saved me again?

481
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:22,410
So, this strange feeling in my body
was from you?

482
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:25,880
 ♫ Thousands of stars in your eyes ♫ 

483
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,990
To save me, you ended up like this.

484
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:32,230
Though I always call you "boss",

485
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,990
if I had the choice,

486
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:38,360
I wouldn't stay by your side.

487
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,570
Because you're dangerous.

488
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:45,680
By modern standards,

489
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:48,720
you'd be a real villain.

490
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,670
But in this foreign world,

491
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:54,800
a villain like you has saved me many times.

492
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,840
 My stomach doesn't hurt anymore. 

493
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,720
 You drank my blood. 

494
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,190
 Of course it doesn't hurt. 

495
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:03,440
 I drank your blood? 

496
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,030
 Now's the time. Let's kill her
and end the threat for good! 

497
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:12,960
 ♫ Mad love blooms a lotus in the heart ♫ 

498
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,650
 Three Saints Mountain
isn't a place for you to run wild. 

499
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:24,690
Shouldn't wounds like this heal instantly for cultivators?

500
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,790
But these wounds on his chest
haven't improved at all.

501
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,440
My body's different.

502
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,060
Wounds are hard to heal.

503
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:42,590
Why would you tell me such a weakness?

504
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:44,550
So what if you know that?

505
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:47,670
What can a little wound like this do to me?

506
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:51,970
At a time like this, you're still putting on the "cool king" act?

507
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:58,950
What's a "cool king" act?

508
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,630
It's like you,

509
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:05,030
always going all out while coughing up blood.

510
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:09,320
You were worried when you saw me hurt.

511
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,340
Was I?

512
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,750
Oh right, how did you get nullify the poison?

513
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:20,740
You drank quite a bit of my blood,

514
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,400
and ate a Bloodseal Bloom.

515
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,840
The legendary flower with
a thousand years of cultivation in one petal?

516
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,070
 Too bad... 

517
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:35,360
 I passed out before I could even taste it. 

518
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,850
 Still, he's quite generous. 

519
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,380
Your cultivation's now at Soulshift.

520
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:48,859
- Well? Do you want to kill me?
- No.

521
00:37:48,859 --> 00:37:51,030
- Want to gain more cultivation?
- No.

522
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:53,790
- Then do you want to leave me?
- No!

523
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,920
 Wait, no! 

524
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,470
 Why was that last answer also "no"? 

525
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:03,080
 Have I gotten so spoiled by endless feasting and pleasure? 

526
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,880
 Well, he exhausted himself saving me. 

527
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,940
 How can I mind being his comfort? 

528
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,660
Being an immortal feels so good.

529
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,940
Don't wander off.

530
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,250
Here in White Deer Cliff,

531
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,990
no one dares extend their spirit sense.

532
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:06,590
Once you leave, you have no idea
how many are watching,

533
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,380
like tigers eyeing prey.

534
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,280
With your current cultivation,

535
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:14,550
if you meet anyone out there,
you'll go mad instantly.

536
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:17,820
Spirit sense is what I felt just now?

537
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,990
 Ever since I came to this world, 

538
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:25,720
 I've always felt it wasn't real enough. 

539
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,510
 But after Sima Jiao's "treatment" today, 

540
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:30,840
 and with my cultivation soaring, 

541
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,860
 I finally feel like I'm truly
in the world of cultivation. 

542
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,630
 Turns out spells are this fun. 

543
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:41,600
 What else can I try? 

544
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,480
 Come. 

545
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:06,590
You reached Soulshift just to be this weak?

546
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:09,530
One block and you failed it.

547
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:11,600
I just started learning spells!

548
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:15,730
Of course I can't compare to your 500 years of nerd grind!

549
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,670
What is "nerd grind"?

550
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:20,630
Still, even with another 500 years,

551
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:23,190
you still can't match me.

552
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,990
Some Grandmaster you are!

553
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:28,240
You're being such a schoolkid!

554
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,550
 Did I just say that out loud? 

555
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:31,780
 Since when was I this brave? 

556
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,590
Are you insulting me?

557
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,190
No!

558
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:38,550
Where I'm from, that's actually a compliment.

559
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:42,010
It means you're cute and lovable.

560
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:45,030
Always thinking about romance,

561
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:48,890
no wonder your people
never make any cultivation progress.

562
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:50,660
True.

563
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:56,910
 I've now mastered the art
of sweet-talking Grandmaster. 

564
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,150
 Enough pretending.
I can tell you want to eat it. 

565
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:08,420
 If you want it, eat your fill. 

566
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:15,880
I can't be mad.

567
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,970
Anger makes one old and ugly.

568
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:48,950


569
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:56,670
