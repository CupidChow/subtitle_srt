00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm here to see you.

2
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm here to see you.

3
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm here to see you.

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm here to see you.

5
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm here to see you.

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm here to see you.

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm here to see you.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm here to see you.

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm here to see you.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm here to see you.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm here to see you.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm here to see you.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm here to see you.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm here to see you.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm here to see you.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm here to see you.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm here to see you.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm here to see you.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm here to see you.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm here to see you.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm here to see you.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm here to see you.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm here to see you.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm here to see you.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We'll always stay together if we live life to its fullest.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
As if only you'd take control of us.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So let your freedom take three steps forward,

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,360
while I'm p Understood?

29
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,680
mountains and rivers,

30
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,000
traveling eight heavens

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,040
Archae projetoures of Sects of The Jings

32
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,040
Who is this?

33
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,240
This sect is more powerful than us.

34
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,240
Maybe it's some great disciple.

35
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,840
Don't bother.

36
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,840
It smells so good.

37
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,240
You can eat whatever you want.

38
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,240
Then I won't be polite.

39
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,240
Boss, didn't you say that we were going to kill someone?

40
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,240
I'm not going to kill anyone.

41
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,240
I'm going to kill someone.

42
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,440
Didn't you say that we were going to kill someone?

43
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,440
Why did you bring me here to unite?

44
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,440
Just to eat and drink together.

45
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,840
Aren't you hungry?

46
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,240
How did you know?

47
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,240
You were talking about your saliva earlier.

48
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,640
So it's because I'm sick of it,

49
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,240
that's why you brought me here to eat.

50
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,240
Thank you, Boss.

51
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,240
So the ancestors have a caring and thoughtful personality.

52
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,840
It seems that he doesn't want to look scary.

53
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,640
You can afford to pay for it.

54
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,640
Please calm down.

55
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,240
You little sects...

56
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,040
I think I heard my master's voice.

57
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,640
You're already a lucky man.

58
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,840
Why are you still so blind?

59
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,040
How dare you!

60
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,040
No matter how much I hate the people,

61
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,640
my master is also the leader of a sect.

62
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,640
How can he let you be so shameless?

63
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,040
Bai Zhu.

64
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,440
Master.

65
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,240
It's really you.

66
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,440
Senior Sister.

67
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,640
Teacher Ting Yan.

68
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,040
What?

69
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,440
You still want to help?

70
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,040
Teacher, Junior Brother, what's going on?

71
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,840
Senior Sister, the disciples of the Heaven's Palace are drunk.

72
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,440
They hit you and spilled the jade deer.

73
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,840
They even slandered you.

74
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,640
Who's drunk?

75
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,240
Isn't it just a bottle of wine?

76
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,440
I'll pay you.

77
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,040
How much?

78
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,640
This jade deer is worth 100 grams of spiritual stones.

79
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,440
See!

80
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,440
None of my business.

81
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,340
Get out!

82
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,040
Go away!

83
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,640
I'll divide the money.

84
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,840
Bullshit!

85
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:11,300
You little

86
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,640
How can this be?

87
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,440
Like hell you want to die.

88
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,640
Yes.

89
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:33,720
Treaty of Song

90
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,640
So great.

91
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,200
Is it really purposes of heart

92
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:37,840
to let me pay tribute to the Emperor

93
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,400
to send a message like this.

94
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,960
Yes, Great.

95
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,080
We've tried it for the first time

96
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,360
already.

97
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,040
But we print too many pictures for Nanyuan Vàhuhu.

98
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,040
I'm relieved to see you leave the mountain safely.

99
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,480
I was worried about you when I saw the lights of the disciples

100
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,160
who were killed by the Grand Master.

101
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,600
Now the whole Xian Mansion is rumored

102
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,040
that Grand Master has a crush on you.

103
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,560
Is it true?

104
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,680
No, no.

105
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,640
Grand Master and I are not that kind of romantic.

106
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,880
Then why did Grand Master treat you so well

107
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,440
and protect you in public?

108
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Perhaps

109
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,320
one day, I can satisfy Grand Master?

110
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,800
Oh, I'm worried that it's your weakness

111
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,080
that you dare not to talk as a gentlemen.

112
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,840
Master,いや You're so full- kein now

113
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,360
If Grand Master was really poised

114
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,400
and the wrestling lights go out,

115
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,040
you can ask this Grand Master for your leave

116
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,520
and come back to Qinggu temple.

117
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,020
Much better.

118
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,680
For me,

119
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,160
what a language is!

120
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,060
Grand Teacher!

121
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,240
Grand Teacher!

122
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,240
Liao Ting Yan

123
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,800
is a disciple of mine

124
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,420
you sent to my side.

125
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:07,360
We can fow someScholars'

126
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,000
for him.

127
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,080
Please forgive cast me for the seguir of them.

128
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:11,560
Grand Teacher!

129
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,180
Please forgive me.

130
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,440
I dare not be hurt.

131
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,440
Tell me.

132
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,400
What reward do you want?

133
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,280
I beg you, teacher.

134
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,800
If there's anything that I shouldn't do,

135
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,560
please forgive me.

136
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,080
Teacher.

137
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,640
No.

138
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,160
You can reward your four spirit veins.

139
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,360
So many?

140
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,680
Four?

141
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,120
Four spirit veins in one go.

142
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,720
No wonder you can win the whole world.

143
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,280
Qinggu Tian, this little sect,

144
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,440
will be able to make it to the Moon Palace.

145
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,040
Thank you for your reward.

146
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,440
Spirit veins are not as strong as the more the better.

147
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,480
For example, Bai Luya's spirit veins

148
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,800
are not for sale.

149
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,400
Bai Luya's spirit energy is so strong.

150
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,160
I don't know what you mean.

151
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,360
Bai Luya's spirit veins

152
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,640
are good for the Sima clan.

153
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,200
For others,

154
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,440
they are poisonous.

155
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,680
If others use Bai Luya's spirit veins to cultivate,

156
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,400
the higher their cultivation, the more dangerous it is.

157
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,440
Once they are combined,

158
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,800
once they are combined,

159
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,520
they will die.

160
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,800
They will die.

161
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
Teacher, don't worry.

162
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,800
You are the one who...

163
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,400
This Sima Jiao really likes Liao Ting Yan.

164
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,800
But she didn't kill herself,

165
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,480
nor did she betray my identity.

166
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,880
What is she up to?

167
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,920
Boss.

168
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,200
Although I don't know how to cultivate,

169
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,000
my body has changed a bit recently.

170
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,600
Maybe it's because I absorbed Bai Luya's spirit energy.

171
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,800
Will I be fine?

172
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I think you will.

173
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
I will?

174
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,200
Will I die?

175
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,600
You are combined.

176
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,400
You are even more combined.

177
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,600
That's good.

178
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,600
I don't have any talent for cultivation.

179
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,800
It seems that talent is also a good thing.

180
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,800
Go back.

181
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,400
Boss.

182
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,200
Didn't you say

183
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,600
we were going to kill someone?

184
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,200
Yes.

185
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,800
But you ate so much just now.

186
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,200
If you saw me kill someone and vomited,

187
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,800
wouldn't it ruin my mood?

188
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,800
Are you caring about me?

189
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,200
You were also caring about me just now.

190
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,800
Not only me,

191
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,600
but also your family.

192
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
I finally see it clearly now.

193
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,600
This ancestor is a good and upright person.

194
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,600
It shouldn't be called Sima Jiao.

195
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,000
It should be called Sima Jiao.

196
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,400
What are you laughing at?

197
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,800
I'm thinking that

198
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,800
you really care about your subordinate.

199
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,800
You are considerate.

200
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,800
I'm grateful to you.

201
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,600
Shut up.

202
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,200
Sima Jiao's spirit energy is more powerful than poison.

203
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,600
Boss.

204
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,600
You have made a lot of achievements.

205
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,000
I just finished the joint work yesterday.

206
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,800
Did you make any achievements?

207
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,600
Fortunately, I didn't.

208
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,600
Boss.

209
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,000
It's possible that Sima Jiao

210
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,200
deliberately poisoned us.

211
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,200
If he knew that

212
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,200
we took Bai Luya's spirit energy

213
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,000
and practiced it secretly,

214
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
why didn't he just kill us?

215
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,200
His blood flowed when he left the mountain.

216
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,800
But he didn't care about it.

217
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,000
The blood of Sima's master, Xue Ning Hua,

218
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,800
must be consumed by the blood of Feng Shan.

219
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,600
Bai Luya's spirit energy is so strong.

220
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,000
It's not surprising.

221
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,400
Then, boss.

222
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,600
How should we deal with it?

223
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,800
Recently,

224
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,200
there have been some highly-trained disciples

225
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,600
who have been practicing in the palace.

226
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,000
If this is true,

227
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,200
I'm afraid that they will

228
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,000
have some problems.

229
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
Should we remind them first

230
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,200
not to practice with the spirit energy?

231
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,600
No.

232
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,400
Calm down the other disciples first.

233
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,600
Don't make any noise.

234
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,800
If Sima Jiao is telling the truth,

235
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,200
can they

236
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,000
be my horsemen?

237
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,400
Master.

238
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,200
Master.

239
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,400
Why are you here?

240
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,800
I really need to find the princess.

241
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,600
Princess.

242
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,800
Recently, there have been some highly-trained disciples

243
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,800
who have been practicing in the palace.

244
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,500
They have become

245
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,200
devils.

246
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,400
They have been

247
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,400
highly-trained for hundreds of years.

248
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,800
They have become the disciples of the Lian Xu.

249
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,600
The Lian Xu.

250
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,800
The next step is to find the princess.

251
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,200
It seems that Sima Jiao is right.

252
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,000
What should we do?

253
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,600
No.

254
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,400
I'll go find the master.

255
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,000
What are you doing?

256
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,200
Master.

257
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,800
I've been serving my master for generations.

258
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,800
I'm afraid that

259
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,800
only you can save me now.

260
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Princess Tian.

261
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
We have deep feelings.

262
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,000
I must help you

263
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,200
with this.

264
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,600
How about this?

265
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,000
Go back and wait for the news.

266
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,600
I'll go to Bailu Cliff right away.

267
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,400
Thank you, master.

268
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,600
Where is Tian Wu Ya?

269
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,000
Tian Wu Ya went to find Shi Qian Lv

270
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,400
early in the morning.

271
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,000
Tian Wu Ya is a good dog of Shi Qian Lv.

272
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,600
That old thing, Shi Qian Lv,

273
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,000
will come to beg for her.

274
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,200
Are we going to see Shi Qian Lv?

275
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,800
I'm not in the mood to go with that old thing.

276
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,400
You come and I go.

277
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,800
Let's go.

278
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,400
Let's call Ting Yan.

279
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,400
He is a spy of the Demon Citadel.

280
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
He is more upright than the people of the late mansion.

281
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,400
He can't see the blood.

282
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,200
He is a bad dog.

283
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,600
Master.

284
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,000
Actually,

285
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm afraid to see the body.

286
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,600
You've been with me for hundreds of years.

287
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,400
Can't you see the trick of the eye?

288
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,200
The trick of the eye?

289
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Are those disciples of the Celestial Palace

290
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,800
really not possessed by the Demon?

291
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,200
Or are you pretending to be

292
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,800
to shock Tian Wu Ya?

293
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,000
Not that again.

294
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,200
I go there and we have to break it.

295
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,200
Is this for real?

296
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,600
If we break it,

297
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,600
it will be the same as you said.

298
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,800
I mean,

299
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,100
once we

300
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:22,800
break it,

301
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,200
we will never fix it.

302
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,200
No moreOK?

303
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,560
The plan Scout frost

304
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,400
is about to come.

305
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,620
I want to smile so they can dance to the rhythm.

306
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,760
iets

307
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,340
peanuts

308
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,700
Me flings

309
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,880
Your Majesty did not protect my joy before.

310
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:06,800
Still the same,

311
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,480
Channel Huayo is so ruthless.

312
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,200
You disappeared into thin air.

313
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,880
Tell us who you are.

314
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:17,960
skills?

315
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,960
We will make things difficult for you in the future.

316
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,480
Please survived this time,

317
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,440
so some rewards are given after this.

318
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,400
and cultivation.

319
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,760
I'm sure your cultivation

320
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,960
is much lower than mine.

321
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,400
If you use the spirit tree to counterattack,

322
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,560
you can still have a chance to fight me.

323
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,920
Why not?

324
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,360
So you're afraid of being counterattacked

325
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,720
because you're a thief.

326
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
How can you let me go?

327
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,360
You do it yourself.

328
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,600
If I'm satisfied,

329
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,960
I'll spare your life.

330
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,280
I was wrong.

331
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,680
The Qiu family wants to kill me.

332
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,800
Are you satisfied?

333
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,640
You are extremely soft-hearted towards yourself.

334
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,880
It's a pity

335
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,200
that Bai Lu Ya has spirit veins.

336
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,520
Really?

337
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,520
You'll know once you try it.

338
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:01,720
You summon the

339
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,420
Fire Tribe.

340
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,600
So you 29後

341
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,460
oba

342
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,540
You put the string on it.

343
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,260
I can't see it.

344
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,800
It has

345
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,240
been 12 years.

346
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,440
How could that happen?

347
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,760
If so,

348
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,600
highlights.

349
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,380
Come on,

350
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,540
your Ophiuchus needs therapy.

351
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,640
He needs your help

352
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,340
to survive in hisChaos Trial.

353
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,960
My lord.

354
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,360
Didn't she say

355
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,480
that your village

356
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,520
only has one mediocre.

357
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,560
Isn't that news

358
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,120
that you have to gram huh?

359
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,420
What'll I do

360
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,160
with no help?

361
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,760
I'll use the way of the pen to return the pen's body.

362
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,760
Master, we have to protect the body with our soul.

363
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,760
If we're alerted, we'll die!

364
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,760
I have strong power.

365
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,760
Should I be tortured by the 500-year-old warning?

366
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,760
Have I done anything wrong?

367
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,760
I'm so tired.

368
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,760
Tian Wu Ya is dead?

369
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,760
Si Ma Qiu, you don't take me seriously!

370
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,760
I waited for Si Ma Qiu to reward me in Bai Lu Ya.

371
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,760
I don't care if he doesn't see me.

372
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,760
He knew that I came to plead for Tian Wu Ya.

373
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,760
He didn't even greet me and just killed him.

374
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,760
Tian Wu Ya has always been good friends with us.

375
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,760
Now, we can't even protect his life.

376
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,760
If this is in the eyes of other princesses,

377
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,760
I'm afraid they will suspect our ability to calm down the internal chaos.

378
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,760
I'm afraid they won't listen to your orders anymore.

379
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,760
Si Ma Qiu's attack on Tian Wu Ya

380
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,760
is not that simple.

381
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,760
He's just trying to make things worse.

382
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,760
Could it be...

383
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,760
He has noticed our plan?

384
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,760
If he really did,

385
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,760
not only our master,

386
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,760
even the whole Geng City would be destroyed by him!

387
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,760
In my opinion,

388
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,760
he doesn't know the truth yet.

389
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,760
Grand Master, the Immortal Maids are summoning other princesses.

390
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,760
They can't hold their anger anymore.

391
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,760
But Tian Wu Ya is dead.

392
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,760
Even if they want to serve a new princess,

393
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,760
they can't do it for a while.

394
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,760
Why would they summon them?

395
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,760
They either want to seal me or kill me.

396
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,760
They just keep coming and going.

397
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,760
If they seal me,

398
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,760
it seems that his martial arts skills are unsurpassable.

399
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,760
If he kills me...

400
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,760
How would he dare to kill you?

401
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,760
Now that the Geng City is under our control,

402
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,760
only you can serve the fire.

403
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,760
He doesn't want to practice, right?

404
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,760
That's why he's doing such a stupid thing.

405
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,760
If he wants to kill me,

406
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,760
his intentions behind it will be interesting.

407
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:45,760
I think everyone has heard about the matter of the Princess of the Celestial Palace.

408
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,760
Grand Master is too cruel.

409
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,760
He's the master of the palace.

410
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,760
He can kill anyone he wants.

411
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,760
I thought Grand Master only killed

412
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,760
those who were against Yin Liu Nian.

413
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,760
Now it seems that

414
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:02,760
we underestimated Grand Master's temperament.

415
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,760
Since he killed Tian Wu Ya,

416
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,760
it means that he's not a good person.

417
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,760
Since he killed Tian Wu Ya,

418
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,760
it means that he's not good enough

419
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,760
to seal him off.

420
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,760
Then we should start from the beginning.

421
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,760
We should restart the seal and seal him off.

422
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,760
Now that Tian Wu Ya is dead,

423
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,760
the new princess is not yet married.

424
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,760
Is it enough for us?

425
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,760
Grand Master was born with a strange temperament.

426
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,760
He's been very cruel since he was a child.

427
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,760
I wanted to talk to him.

428
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,760
But now it seems that

429
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,760
he's already dead.

430
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,760
Alright.

431
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,760
Since that's the case,

432
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,760
I'm willing to do my best.

433
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,760
Good.

434
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,760
It's not difficult to have Grand Master's help.

435
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,760
Does everyone agree?

436
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,760
Yes.

437
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,760
Princess Ye.

438
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,760
If Si Ma Sect is sealed off,

439
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,760
I can't find a chance to kill him.

440
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,760
It seems that the former princess of the Four Seasons Palace

441
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,760
has something to say.

442
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,760
What does she mean?

443
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,760
I think we should think about it from the beginning.

444
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,760
If we start the seal and seal,

445
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,760
we'll be defeated.

446
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,760
I'm afraid that all my disciples will be killed.

447
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,760
Is it worth the price?

448
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,760
We've all been poisoned by Si Ma Sect.

449
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,760
He won't just let it go.

450
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,760
Tian Wu Ya is an example.

451
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,760
I'm not poisoned by Si Ma Sect.

452
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,760
You're not poisoned by Si Ma Sect.

453
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,760
That doesn't mean your ancestors are not poisoned.

454
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,760
Will Grand Master let you go?

455
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,760
How did Tian Wu Ya die?

456
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,760
Tian Wu Ya was punished by stealing the spiritual vein.

457
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,760
If everyone is not good to Grand Master,

458
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,760
Grand Master may not be concerned.

459
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,760
I know.

460
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,760
Princess Yuan,

461
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,760
you're hesitant because your disciple of the Four Seasons Palace

462
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,760
has Grand Master's help.

463
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,760
Ridiculous.

464
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,760
Grand Master, as you expected,

465
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,760
Shi Qian Lü has called other princesses

466
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,760
to discuss about sealing you.

467
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,760
Except for the princess of the Four Seasons Palace,

468
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,760
everyone agreed to her request.

469
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,760
But...

470
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,760
But Ru Ling didn't say anything.

471
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,760
The Four Seasons Palace?

472
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,760
Grand Master, please forgive me.

473
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,760
How fresh.

474
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,760
Eight Great Palace

475
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,760
has a smart person.

476
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,760
According to your order,

477
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,760
Shi Qian Lü's cultivation is quite high.

478
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,760
It's a good deal

479
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,760
to replace Tian Wu Ya

480
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,760
who can seal the city.

481
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,760
Maybe,

482
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,760
he has made great achievements.

483
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,760
Isn't it the same as Grand Master?

484
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,760
He doesn't deserve to compare with me.

485
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,760
Shi Qian Lü

486
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,760
should use Yuan Che's weakness

487
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,760
to use him.

488
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,760
But I didn't notice Yuan Che before.

489
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,760
You go find him.

490
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,760
See if he has any weakness.

491
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,760
Yes.

492
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,760
Let's see who can win this game.

493
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,760
Father, Yuan Che is so stubborn.

494
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,760
He must be a coward.

495
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,760
It seems that we need to use some tricks.

496
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,760
You underestimated him.

497
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,760
Grand Master left the mountain.

498
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,760
He's like a shadow.

499
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,760
He's very cautious.

500
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,760
Now, he's attacking

501
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,760
the disciple Liao Ting Yan.

502
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,760
He's trusted by the Four Seasons.

503
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,760
He doesn't dare to

504
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,760
punish him easily.

505
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,760
If you want him to rebel,

506
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,760
you need to use his strength.

507
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,760
Does he have a son

508
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,760
named Yuan Shang?

509
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,760
Yuan Shang?

510
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,760
He was injured by the forest root.

511
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,760
He was in danger.

512
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,760
Yuan Che has suffered a lot

513
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,760
for him.

514
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,760
I'll find a chance to kill Yuan Shang

515
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,760
and return the horse to him.

516
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,760
You want to kill him?

517
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,760
It's not impossible.

518
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,760
Father.

519
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,760
Can you change into rainerediths?

520
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,760
I'm very��Beef Gate Master.

521
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,760
God speed you.

522
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,760
murdered

523
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,760
What do you warehouse this bath Issuingkongon?

524
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,760
This is my warehouse.

525
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,760
《Xingting Moon clan》

526
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,760
Wu centcią

527
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,760
I can't allow anyone.

528
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,760
You please give me a seat.

529
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,760
I'm afraid your house is too noisy.

530
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,580
Come out.

531
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:12,760
Wait when you come to disconnect us.

532
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,760
My home is empty now.

533
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,760
Let me let you through.

534
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,560
Yu E

535
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,760
The reflective stone.

536
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,760
You may need some money as you like.

537
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,680
This beauty's color and light fragrance.

538
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,400
Can't be a love letter.

539
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,640
Xiaochuan.

540
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,760
Luckily I know her.

541
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:48,500
Tonight, purple- filled

542
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:51,680
How come she doesn't have a落款.

543
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,080
It's only a few days.

544
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:53,960
Are you showing off again today?

545
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,920
Did Si Ma Jiao from Nambu City

546
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,000
come see me today?

547
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,840
No, no, no.

548
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,280
Nothing like this.

549
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,000
The pink flower

550
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,920
couldn't be made by

551
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,120
a steel undead man.

552
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,200
Then, quality of tone...

553
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,000
Turns out,

554
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,900
she has been through hell

555
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,200
since Muito-Sanshu came.

556
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,440
You say no more.

557
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,840
No more, no more.

558
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,320
I'm endured

559
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,640
with a mental instability like 8th Sister.

560
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,920
Now we have another lover.

561
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,680
It's not me.

562
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:54,960
Okay.

563
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,040
Then don't blame me for being rude.

564
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,840
Why is it coming again?

565
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,840
It hurts.

566
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,480
Is there anyone else?

567
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,480
No one.

568
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,960
No, I have to go find the Master.

569
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,480
Otherwise, I'll hang up before 120 comes.

570
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,960
Where is the Master?

571
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,240
Master.

572
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,760
This is the private domain of the Master.

573
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,160
When I was in Mount Sansheng,

574
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,520
Brother Snake brought me in.

575
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,880
I came here on my own this time.

576
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,600
I was suspicious.

577
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,080
What if he gets angry?

578
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,960
It hurts.

579
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,560
Oh!

580
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,240
Wake up.

581
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:20,720
Wake up.

582
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,800
My blood and poса should be over hell by now.

583
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,400
It means he still falls into

584
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,400
It's not a normal poison.

585
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,400
It's not a spy of the Demon Lord.

586
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,400
Why do you get rebelled again and again?

587
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,400
Open your mouth.

588
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,400
Bite.

589
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,400
Bite.

590
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,400
Don't be too hard.

591
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,400
You can't be too hard.

592
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,400
It's much harder than killing.

593
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,400
You can't be too hard.

594
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,400
You can't be too hard.

595
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,400
You can't be too hard.

596
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,400
You can't be too hard.

597
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,400
You can't be too hard.

598
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,400
You can't be too hard.

599
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,400
You can't be too hard.

600
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,400
You can't be too hard.

601
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,400
You can't be too hard.

602
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,400
You can't be too hard.

603
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,400
You can't be too hard.

604
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,400
You can't be too hard.

605
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,400
You can't be too hard.

606
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,400
You can't be too hard.

607
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,400
I want to be with you forever.

608
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,400
I want to be with you forever.

609
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,400
I only kill people in my life.

610
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,400
I save people several times because of you.

611
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,400
But you are useless.

612
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,400
You can't even hold my blood.

613
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,400
I'm drunk.

614
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,400
I sigh that time can change.

615
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,400
I'm not willing to love.

616
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,400
If time doesn't come.

617
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,400
Even if the history is endless.

618
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,400
I still want to be with you.

619
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:40,400
I want to be with you forever.

620
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,400
Where am I?

621
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,400
It's so cold.

622
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,400
Why is it so dark around?

623
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,400
Isn't this the blood flower of the deceased?

624
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,400
It's been a long time since I felt so relaxed.

625
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,400
I slept in the wrong place.

626
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,400
Boss was wrong to give me an injection.

627
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,400
Why is it so noisy outside?

628
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,400
Why do I suddenly have

629
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,400
a thousand miles of eyes and a wind-blown ear?

630
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,400
I feel like I can move mountains and sea with my hands.

631
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,400
Boss, I seem to be strong.

632
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,400
Shizu.

633
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,400
I'm sorry.

634
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,400
I'm sorry.

635
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,400
I'm sorry.

636
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,400
Boss.

637
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,400
Shizu.

638
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,400
Still alive.

639
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,400
I was scared to death.

640
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,400
It's hard to imagine how he survived these five hundred years.

641
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,400
This wound is heartache.

642
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,400
I almost died of pain last night.

643
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,400
It hurts.

644
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,400
Did you save me?

645
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,400
Then am I in the same state now?

646
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,400
Did you squeeze me?

647
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,400
To save me,

648
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,400
you made yourself like this.

649
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,400
Although I always call you boss,

650
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,400
but if I could choose,

651
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,400
I wouldn't stay with you.

652
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,400
Because you are a very dangerous person.

653
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,400
According to the standards of modern society,

654
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,400
you should be a bad guy.

655
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,400
But a bad guy like you

656
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,400
saved me again and again in this world.

657
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,400
I don't have a stomachache.

658
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,400
You drank my blood.

659
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,400
Of course it won't hurt.

660
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,400
I drank your blood.

661
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,400
Sister.

662
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,400
Now let's kill him.

663
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,400
You will regret it.

664
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,400
Three Holy Mountains is not a place for you to be free.

665
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,400
It's not a place for me to be free.

666
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,400
This kind of injury should be healed

667
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,400
in a moment for a cultivator.

668
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,400
But I don't see any signs of improvement

669
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,400
in the wound on the chest.

670
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,400
My body is special.

671
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,400
It's hard to heal the wound.

672
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,400
Why do you tell me about this weakness?

673
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,400
So what if I tell you?

674
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,400
This little wound can cure me.

675
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,400
At this time,

676
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,400
you still have to be a Bikini.

677
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,400
What is a Bikini?

678
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,400
It's like you.

679
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,400
Always open your eyes and spit blood.

680
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,400
You look a little nervous

681
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,400
when you see me hurt.

682
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,400
Do I?

683
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,400
By the way,

684
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,400
how did you detoxify me?

685
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,400
You drank my blood

686
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,400
and ate blood lilies.

687
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,400
The legendary blood lily

688
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,400
that can grow thousands of years of cultivation.

689
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,400
What a pity.

690
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,400
I didn't taste it.

691
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,400
I just smelled it and I passed out.

692
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,400
But

693
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,400
Sima Jiao is really generous.

694
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,400
Your cultivation has reached the stage of transformation.

695
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,400
So,

696
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,400
do you want to kill me?

697
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,400
No.

698
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,400
Do you want to improve your cultivation?

699
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,400
No.

700
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,400
Then do you want to leave me?

701
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,400
No.

702
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,400
Wait, no.

703
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,400
Why is the last answer no?

704
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,400
Have I been subdued

705
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,400
by the life I've been treated?

706
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,400
Forget it.

707
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,400
She's so tired to save me.

708
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:22,180
Just be a

709
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,400
fairy.

710
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,400
It's so happy to be a fairy.

711
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,400
Don't run around.

712
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,400
I dare not approach

713
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,400
the other's gods in Bailuya.

714
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,400
Except Bailuya,

715
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,400
you don't know how many people

716
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,400
are out there.

717
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,400
With your current cultivation,

718
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,400
you'll fall into the pool

719
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,400
at any moment.

720
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,400
The gods are the ones just now?

721
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,400
After coming to this world,

722
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,400
I always feel that

723
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,400
everything here is not sincere enough.

724
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,400
But today,

725
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,400
Sima Jiao has done so much.

726
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,400
Her cultivation has improved a lot.

727
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,400
Now that she has the sense of

728
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,400
being a real fairy,

729
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,400
it's so fun to learn magic.

730
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,400
What else can I do?

731
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,400
Come on.

732
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,400
You're so weak

733
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,400
after you've become a fairy.

734
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,400
You've been beaten

735
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,400
so easily.

736
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,400
I've just learned magic.

737
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,400
Of course I can't compare to you,

738
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,400
a master who has learned magic for 500 years.

739
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,400
What's a master?

740
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,400
But even if I give you 500 years,

741
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,400
you can't compare to me.

742
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,400
You're not a master.

743
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,400
You're just a little student.

744
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,400
I'm just a little student.

745
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,400
I'm just a little student.

746
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,400
I'm just a little student.

747
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,400
I'm just a little student.

748
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,400
I'm really a little student.

749
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,400
How dare you scold her?

750
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,400
You dare to scold me?

751
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,400
No, no, no.

752
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,400
A little student said that

753
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:41,400
you're cute and attractive.

754
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,400
I miss love every day.

755
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,400
No wonder your cultivation

756
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,400
is so good.

757
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,400
Yes.

758
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,400
I'm now able to coax the teachers.

759
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,400
I'm finally clear.

760
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,400
I'm finally clear.

761
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,400
Don't act.

762
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,400
I can tell that you want to eat.

763
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,400
If you want to eat, I'll let you eat a dog.

764
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,400
Don't be angry.

765
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,400
You'll get old and super.

766
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,400
The moon shines bright in the night.

767
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,400
It's the silence that burns the world.

768
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,440
The candlelight is weak.

769
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,440
The shadow is shattering.

770
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,800
Shimmering in the dark night.

771
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,480
The color of light is enough.

772
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,600
It warms your cold soul.

773
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,480
The memory is clear.

774
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,400
The longing is clear.

775
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:29,000
But I can't sleep.

776
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:46,180
The

777
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,180
The

778
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,180
The

779
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,180
The

780
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,180
The

781
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,180
The

782
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,180
The

783
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,180
The

784
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,180
The

785
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,180
The

786
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,180
I will follow you to the end of the world.

787
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,180
I will follow you to the end of the world.

788
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,180
I will follow you to the end of the world.

789
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:03,180
I will follow you to the end of the world.

790
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:05,180
I will follow you to the end of the world.

791
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:07,180
I will follow you to the end of the world.

792
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:09,180
I will follow you to the end of the world.

793
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:11,180
I will follow you to the end of the world.

794
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:13,180
I will follow you to the end of the world.

795
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:15,180
I will follow you to the end of the world.

796
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,180
I will follow you to the end of the world.

797
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:19,180
I will follow you to the end of the world.

798
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,180
I will follow you to the end of the world.

799
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:23,180
I will follow you to the end of the world.

800
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,180
You, for me,

801
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:26,080
for the

802
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,080
wounds on my body,

803
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,080
the sea of clouds is warm,

804
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,080
the rain is pouring down,

805
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,520
I am being

806
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,520
comforted by it.

807
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,520
You, for me,

808
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,520
for the

809
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,520
sincere

810
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,520
surrender,

811
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,520
facing the

812
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,520
promise,

813
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,520
I will never

814
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,520
let my body

815
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,520
be lightened

816
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:59,020
more.
