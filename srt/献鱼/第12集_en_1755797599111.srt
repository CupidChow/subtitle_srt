1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The wind and the moon are both short, but love can be exchanged between them.

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
But who loves me?

3
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
If the time in my life is short,

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
even if this life is endless and I can't live it,

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I still want to be with you.

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The entangled life and death are not returning.

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The wind and the moon are both short, but love can be exchanged between them.

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
But who loves me?

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The wind and the moon are both short, but love can be exchanged between them.

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The wind and the moon are both short, but love can be exchanged between them.

11
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You're fine now. You can live your life freely now.

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Can I still be free from this?

13
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The blood of the Fusha Clan

14
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
will drag me into this tragedy one day.

15
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
He's right.

16
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Grand Master, you should go to Qingniang first.

17
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Please.

18
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Anyway, you haven't seen your daughter yet.

19
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You named her Yueqing yourself. Don't you want to see her?

20
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yueqing?

21
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
My daughter?

22
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Zhou Yueqing. You named her yourself.

23
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Go with me to see her.

24
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I don't want to see you.

25
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm fine.

26
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'll go with you.

27
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'll go with you.

28
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'll go with you.

29
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'll go with you.

30
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'll go with you.

31
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm fine.

32
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Thank you.

33
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Although I feel uneasy right now,

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
it's also the most reassuring moment in all these years.

35
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Rest easier?

36
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I feel like I just learned

37
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,200
I can rest assured.

38
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,600
Congratulations, Young Master.

39
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,320
The man from the south is here.

40
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,680
Huan.

41
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,200
Huan.

42
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,520
Qingniang.

43
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,720
Look.

44
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,200
This is a garden

45
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,720
I chose for us

46
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,080
with the help of this girl and this young master.

47
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,960
Do you like it?

48
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,800
Qingniang.

49
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,040
Why waste time on a useless person like me?

50
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:46,920
Huan.

51
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,880
Do you want to hug our daughter?

52
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,160
Here.

53
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,640
Huan.

54
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,400
Why are you crying?

55
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,920
The atmosphere is so touching.

56
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,400
It's rude to stop crying.

57
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,760
When I think of what happened to Su Cheng,

58
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,760
I feel so powerful.

59
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,520
Huan.

60
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,240
Sit.

61
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,720
Huan.

62
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,040
Thanks to that kind girl

63
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,240
who prepared all this for us.

64
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,640
Our family is reunited.

65
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,120
You should sleep with her.

66
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,960
I'll prepare some food.

67
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,080
Tonight,

68
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,400
we should celebrate it.

69
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,000
Qingniang.

70
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,920
You look like this now.

71
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,120
It's so different from

72
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,760
when I saw you in the flower house.

73
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,160
You smiled at Qingcheng with your pen-tip.

74
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,160
You didn't touch the spring water.

75
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,680
But now you dare to lie to me

76
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,480
and do me a favor.

77
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,520
Huan.

78
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,520
Don't make fun of me.

79
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,720
As long as you and Yue are with me,

80
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,520
I'm willing to do anything.

81
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,440
wandering lily flowers

82
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,760
Yue,

83
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,880
this wine is good.

84
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,680
Yue,

85
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,920
I don't want to go back there.

86
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,440
It's so scary.

87
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,640
Let go of me.

88
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,120
It's so disgusting.

89
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,640
I'm not a ghost.

90
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,040
I can't do anything.

91
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,840
Yuan'er,

92
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,640
you're not as good as my father.

93
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,640
I'm not a ghost.

94
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,640
I'm not a ghost.

95
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,640
I'm not a ghost.

96
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,640
I'm not a ghost.

97
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,640
I'm not a ghost.

98
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,920
Yuan'er,

99
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,920
you can only live a happy and peaceful life

100
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,920
by finding a place where no one can find you.

101
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,920
You don't have to worry about your mother.

102
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,920
Just go with me, okay?

103
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,920
The fate of the Yuan family

104
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,920
is at the end of you and me.

105
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,920
The young master and the mother

106
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,920
are now friends and loyal.

107
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,920
We've done a good thing.

108
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,920
We can send our good luck to them.

109
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,920
Do you really think

110
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,920
it will last long?

111
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,920
Of course it will.

112
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,920
Master,

113
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,920
the fate of people

114
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,920
is in our hands.

115
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,920
As long as we change our minds,

116
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,920
we can move the fate.

117
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,920
Do you know what the fate is?

118
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,920
I know.

119
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,920
My fate is

120
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,920
that I'm destined to live a happy and peaceful life.

121
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,920
It's a happy day.

122
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,920
Yuan'er,

123
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,920
Huan'er.

124
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,920
Huan'er.

125
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,920
Don't come over.

126
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,920
Huan'er.

127
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,920
Huan'er.

128
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,920
Don't come over.

129
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,920
Huan'er.

130
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,920
Don't come over.

131
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,920
I won't.

132
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,920
Don't come over.

133
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,920
Huan'er.

134
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,920
Huan'er.

135
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,920
No.

136
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,920
Don't come over.

137
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,920
Huan'er.

138
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,920
Put Yuan'er down.

139
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,920
Qingniang,

140
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,920
why don't you cut the rope?

141
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,920
No.

142
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,920
No.

143
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,920
You don't know

144
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,920
what kind of life Yuan'er will face.

145
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,920
Huan'er.

146
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,920
Stop it.

147
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,920
Huan'er.

148
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,920
No.

149
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,920
Qingniang.

150
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,920
Calm down.

151
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,920
Qingniang.

152
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,920
You'd rather live a miserable life

153
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,920
than die with dignity.

154
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,920
Huan'er.

155
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,920
Huan'er.

156
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,920
Give me back my Yuan'er.

157
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,920
Huan'er.

158
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,920
Huan'er.

159
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,920
Huan'er, please save him.

160
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,920
Huan'er.

161
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,920
Si Tu.

162
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,920
I don't want him to have such a life.

163
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,920
Why don't we end

164
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,920
the tragedy of the Yis?

165
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,920
Give me back my Yuan'er.

166
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,920
Huan'er.

167
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,920
Si Tu, you can save him, right?

168
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,920
Huan'er.

169
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,920
You're a man of your word.

170
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,920
You can save Mr. Yan and your son.

171
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,920
Qingniang, you're a man of your word.

172
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,920
No one can save him.

173
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,920
Huan'er.

174
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,920
This is his life.

175
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,920
No.

176
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,920
But what about the child?

177
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,920
The child is a living individual.

178
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,920
He should have his own destiny.

179
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,920
He can decide his own destiny.

180
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,920
Si Tu, your mother can't.

181
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,920
You can't either, Yan Huan.

182
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,920
No.

183
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,920
Huan'er.

184
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,920
You're right.

185
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,920
Huan'er, give me back my Yuan'er.

186
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,920
Yan Huan.

187
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,920
Give me back my Yuan'er.

188
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,920
Yu'er.

189
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,920
You're so infatuated with someone.

190
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,920
I don't want you to repeat my misfortune.

191
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,920
I don't want you to end up like this.

192
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,920
No.

193
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,920
No, Huan'er.

194
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,920
Huan'er.

195
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,920
I beg you.

196
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,920
No.

197
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,920
No, Huan'er.

198
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,920
Huan'er.

199
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,920
Huan'er.

200
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,920
No.

201
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,920
Huan'er, please help me.

202
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,920
Huan'er.

203
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,920
He's been talking nonsense for too long.

204
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,920
But this Fengshan Xuen Sect

205
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,920
is no match for him.

206
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,920
Great.

207
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,920
I can finally end this.

208
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,920
I can finally become a human.

209
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,920
Huan'er.

210
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,920
Since I opened the spiritual palace,

211
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,920
I've been feeling

212
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,920
that everything is related to me.

213
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,920
I'm also moved by

214
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,920
the fate of others here.

215
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,920
Today, the tragedy of Zhou Qing'er and Yan Huan

216
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,920
made me feel so bad.

217
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,920
Yan Huan has only lived for more than twenty years.

218
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,920
But the Grand Master has lived for hundreds of years

219
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,920
under this fate.

220
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,920
For Yan Huan,

221
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,920
death is the only solution.

222
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,920
What about the Grand Master?

223
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,920
He must be in more pain than Yan Huan.

224
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,920
But

225
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,920
what can I persuade him?

226
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,920
Kill him.

227
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,920
Kill him.

228
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,920
Kill him.

229
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,920
Kill him.

230
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,920
So that you can end your miserable fate.

231
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,920
No.

232
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,920
No.

233
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,920
His life is more difficult than mine.

234
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,920
Give it to me.

235
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,920
Give it to me.

236
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,920
Hurry.

237
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,920
Hurry, they're coming.

238
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,920
Hurry.

239
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,920
No.

240
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,920
Huan'er.

241
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,920
Yan Huan.

242
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,920
Huan'er.

243
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,920
Si Ma Jiao.

244
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,920
The End

245
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,920
Grand Master.

246
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,920
The butterfly I specifically hit

247
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,920
is so cute, isn't it?

248
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,920
Grand Master.

249
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,920
I know what you want to say.

250
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,920
I still want to say

251
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,920
you're not Yan Huan.

252
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,920
You're yourself.

253
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,920
We're just like two people.

254
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,920
Grand Master.

255
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,920
I'm awake.

256
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,920
Si Ma Jiao is also awake.

257
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,920
Why hasn't there been any movement this time?

258
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,920
Could it be that he fainted?

259
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,920
Great.

260
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,920
You're fine.

261
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,920
You scared me to death.

262
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,920
No.

263
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,920
Kill him.

264
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,920
Kill him.

265
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,920
So that you can end your miserable fate.

266
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,920
Xiao'er.

267
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,920
Xiao'er.

268
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,920
Mojie.

269
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,920
Grand Master, what's wrong with you?

270
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,920
I had a dream.

271
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,920
Grand Master, you not only fell asleep,

272
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,920
but also had a dream.

273
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,920
What did you dream about?

274
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,920
I dreamed of that woman.

275
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,920
When others see me,

276
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,920
they're afraid,

277
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,920
disgusted,

278
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,920
and happy.

279
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,920
But she treated me

280
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,920
like a flower and tree on the roadside.

281
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,920
Boss.

282
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,920
Boss Yan.

283
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,920
Don't look so good.

284
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,920
You're not a master.

285
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,920
You're just a little student.

286
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,920
This kind of simple emotion

287
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,920
always makes me feel calm.

288
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,920
She's so weak.

289
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,920
But she can still take care of herself well.

290
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,920
High-ranking people.

291
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,920
Come and welcome us to Baifeng Mountain.

292
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,920
The people from Baifeng Mountain are here.

293
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,920
Take this.

294
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,920
Why don't you take me?

295
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,920
You stay here.

296
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,920
Let's go.

297
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,920
Greetings, Grand Master.

298
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,920
As usual,

299
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,920
if the blood vein is pure,

300
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,920
we'll give you a generous reward.

301
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,920
If the blood vein is not good,

302
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,920
you can take the child back.

303
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,920
Yes.

304
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,920
I know the rules.

305
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,920
Son.

306
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,920
Go.

307
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,920
Take the child.

308
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,920
Hurry.

309
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,920
Yan.

310
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,920
Thank you.

311
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,920
You used to go alone.

312
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,920
Why are you alone now?

313
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,920
This is my son.

314
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,920
He will inherit my family business in the future.

315
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,920
So I'll let him see it sooner or later.

316
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,920
Yan.

317
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,920
High-ranking people.

318
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,920
Who is he?

319
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,920
We did it for the sake of our lives.

320
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,920
Don't blame it on us.

321
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,920
We'll wait here.

322
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,920
Do you understand the rules?

323
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,920
You can't make any mistake here.

324
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,920
This is the place.

325
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,920
You ignorant kid.

326
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,920
How dare you offend Lin Shan.

327
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,920
Lin Shan?

328
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,920
You can call it Lin Shan here.

329
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,920
What?

330
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,920
You Yan family are against it.

331
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,920
Son.

332
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,920
Don't be rude.

333
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,920
There are hundreds of people in our Yan family.

334
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,920
How can you be so rude?

335
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,920
Forget it.

336
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,920
Don't make a fuss here.

337
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,920
I'll go to the mountain.

338
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,920
I'll go to the mountain.

339
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,920
I'll go to the mountain.

340
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,920
I'll go to the mountain.

341
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,920
I'll go to the mountain.

342
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,920
I'll go to the mountain.

343
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,920
I'll go to the mountain.

344
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,920
Enough.

345
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,920
Don't waste your time here.

346
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,920
You.

347
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,920
Send him in.

348
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,920
You don't have to do this.

349
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,920
You've been alive for too long.

350
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,920
Take me in.

351
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,920
Sima Shi's formation is stable.

352
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,920
The defense of the vanguard is good.

353
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,920
Go.

354
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,920
Go.

355
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,920
Brother.

356
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,920
Brother.

357
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,920
Brother.

358
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,920
Brother.

359
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,920
The people of the Fengshan Clan.

360
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,920
Please kill us.

361
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,920
They've been

362
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,920
faster than us

363
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,920
in blood circulation.

364
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,920
They're almost done.

365
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,920
Use more strength.

366
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,920
Be careful.

367
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,920
It's okay.

368
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,920
I beg you to kill us.

369
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,920
How could I kill my own people?

370
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,920
We're the ones who will die.

371
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,920
Let the pain end in your hands.

372
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,920
It's better than being eaten by them

373
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,920
after bleeding.

374
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,920
I beg you.

375
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,920
Please kill us.

376
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,920
I beg you.

377
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,920
Come on. Be careful.

378
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,920
I beg you.

379
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,920
I beg you.

380
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,920
I shouldn't let the child die.

381
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,920
I don't want them to take the child away.

382
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,920
How could you be so heartless?

383
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,920
Do I have to let this child

384
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,920
be treated like us

385
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,920
after he grows up?

386
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,920
I took the child away.

387
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,920
Do you want to die?

388
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,920
I don't want to live

389
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,920
in this miserable life.

390
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,920
I don't want my child

391
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,920
to live in this hell.

392
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,920
I don't want him to have such a life.

393
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,920
How could the child

394
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,920
be different from the caged bird?

395
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,920
Go.

396
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,920
Follow them.

397
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,920
Hurry up.

398
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,920
Go.

399
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,920
Hurry up.

400
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,920
Hurry up.

401
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,920
Uncle, give the blood to drink the porridge.

402
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,920
Uncle, give the blood to drink the porridge.

403
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,920
Uncle, give the blood to drink the porridge.

404
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,920
Uncle, hold on.

405
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,920
It's much better to let the blood out.

406
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,920
I want to drink the porridge.

407
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,920
The porridge.

408
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,920
Give me the blood.

409
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,920
Who made you like this?

410
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,920
Drink the porridge.

411
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,920
Give me the blood.

412
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,920
Give me the blood.

413
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,920
Where is your uncle?

414
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,920
I want to drink the porridge.

415
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,920
Tell me where your uncle is.

416
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,920
How many people

417
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,920
of the Fengshan Clan are there?

418
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,920
I don't know.

419
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,920
Every person has a child

420
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,920
with a fire-infused birthmark.

421
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,920
They will be sent to Bai Feng Mountain.

422
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,920
Go.

423
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,920
Go.

424
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,920
We can leave now.

425
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,920
Uncle.

426
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,920
You dare to stop me?

427
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,920
We have the support of the Sima Clan.

428
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,920
We can't get any benefits.

429
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,920
I don't think you can save anyone.

430
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,920
Their bodies

431
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,920
are all banned.

432
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,920
Once they break through the dead end,

433
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,920
they will all die.

434
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,920
Don't run.

435
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,920
Come back.

436
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,920
Stop.

437
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,920
If you leave here, you will die.

438
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,920
It's better than being eaten by the wild animals

439
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,920
and never seeing the sun again.

440
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,920
Come back.

441
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,920
Come back.

442
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,920
Come back.

443
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,920
Father.

444
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,920
Sima Clan broke into Bai Feng Mountain.

445
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,920
I'm afraid he will destroy our efforts.

446
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,920
Go.

447
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,920
Tell the princesses

448
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,920
that Chi Yan City has sent a message to ask for help.

449
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,920
Sima Clan is crazy.

450
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,920
Burn Bai Feng Mountain

451
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,920
and destroy Chi Yan City.

452
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,920
Yes.

453
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,920
Zhen Xu.

454
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,920
You set fire to Chi Yan City.

455
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:12,920
Let the fire go.

456
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,920
Tell them that

457
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,920
Sima Qiao did it.

458
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,920
Sima Qiao.

459
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,920
You want to die?

460
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,920
Greetings, Leader.

461
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,920
Now the Shi family and other palaces

462
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,920
are trying to capture Sima Qiao.

463
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,920
Maybe they can use their hands

464
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,920
to take Sima Qiao's life.

465
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,920
Have you told the people

466
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,920
about Bai Feng Mountain?

467
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,920
Leader.

468
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,920
The original princess is ill.

469
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,920
She can't come.

470
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,920
Princess Ye doesn't know her ancestors.

471
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,920
The other princesses are ready.

472
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,920
Ru Li.

473
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,920
The Shi family is gathering

474
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,920
the other princesses and elders.

475
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,920
They must have found

476
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,920
the ancestors.

477
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,920
Ru Li.

478
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,920
Keep an eye on them.

479
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,920
I'll go back and tell the other people.

480
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,920
Nian Jiu.

481
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,920
I'm sorry.

482
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,920
I can't let you tell the people about Sima Qiao.

483
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,920
Okay.

484
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,920
Let's go.

485
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,920
The other princesses and the Shi family

486
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,920
are trying to capture Sima Qiao.

487
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,920
Maybe this is the best time

488
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,920
for me and the people

489
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,920
to return to the Demon Citadel.

490
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,920
What are you looking at?

491
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,920
You're so mean.

492
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,920
You're so mean.

493
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,920
The fire is on.

494
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,920
Run.

495
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,920
The fire is on?

496
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,920
What's going on?

497
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,920
What's going on?

498
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,920
What's going on?

499
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,920
Run.

500
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,920
Is there something wrong with the Crown Prince?

501
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,920
No.

502
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,920
I have to find him.

503
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,920
No.

504
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,920
My kid.

505
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,920
My kid.

506
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,920
My child is 우 Mercedes of fortune.

507
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,480
Ku and Bai!

508
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,040
Li Huo Han?

509
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,200
Master Yan?

510
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,200
I must find Si Ma Jiao quickly.

511
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,200
Si Ma Jiao

512
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,200
As long as I exist,

513
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,200
Si Ma clan's fate can't be changed.

514
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,200
If one day,

515
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,200
there is no more fengshan fire in the world,

516
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,200
Si Ma clan may be able to be freed.

517
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,200
Si Ma clan

518
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,200
Next life,

519
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,200
let's meet a good person.

520
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,200
Si Ma clan

521
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,200
Si Ma clan

522
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,200
Master

523
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,200
Why did you make yourself so embarrassed?

524
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,200
I'm going to die.

525
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,200
What are you kidding?

526
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,200
Since I was born,

527
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,200
there have been many people who want to kill me.

528
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,200
They want my life.

529
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,200
But I don't want to give them.

530
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,200
Whoever has my life,

531
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,200
I want their life.

532
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,200
But

533
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,200
Master

534
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,200
If you want my life now,

535
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,200
I can give it to you.

536
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,200
Do you want it?

537
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,200
No

538
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,200
But this is your mission.

539
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,200
I know you don't want to kill me.

540
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,200
But if I die in your hands,

541
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,200
it's also good for you.

542
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,200
Don't want my life, okay?

543
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,200
You won't die.

544
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,200
You really don't want my life?

545
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,200
No

546
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,200
Then you will die with me.

547
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,200
I live with you.

548
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,200
Get up.

549
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,200
Let's leave here first.

550
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,200
Master

551
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,200
Get up.

552
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,200
Only if you come back here completely,

553
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,200
you can make Fengshan Xuanmai

554
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,200
not to be used by others.

555
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,200
I will die.

556
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,200
My body

557
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,200
will be burned by this fire.

558
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,200
No

559
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,200
I won't leave any blood on them.

560
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,200
This Fengshan clan

561
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,200
will be destroyed completely.

562
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,200
This soul fire has been extinguished.

563
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,200
Fengshan Xianfu's life

564
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,200
will be broken.

565
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,200
Don't say these things again.

566
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,200
Get up first.

567
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,200
Let's leave here.

568
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,200
I thought you would run away.

569
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,200
I told you to run away.

570
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,200
Why didn't you run away?

571
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,200
You don't recover at all.

572
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,200
You don't sleep at all.

573
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,200
You should be more active.

574
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,200
Anyway, I will be burned to ashes.

575
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,200
What will happen

576
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,200
is important.

577
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,160
The

578
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,200
They come so soon.

579
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,200
Why are there so many Sima clan members here?

580
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,200
They are not entirely Sima clan members.

581
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,200
Sima clan has been burned to ashes.

582
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,200
They should be from Fengshan clan.

583
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,200
They should be from Fengshan clan.

584
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,200
We don't have time to care about these things.

585
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,200
The most important thing is

586
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,200
to capture them

587
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,200
while he is injured by the formation.

588
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,200
Remember it.

589
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,200
We must keep him alive.

590
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,200
Zhixian brigade.

591
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,200
Zhixian brigade.

592
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,200
The moon is half broken.

593
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,200
It burns the loneliness.

594
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,200
The candlelight is weak.

595
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,200
The shadow is broken.

596
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,200
Shimmering in the dark night.

597
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,200
The color of light is enough.

598
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,200
It warms your cold soul.

599
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,200
Memories stop.

600
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,200
Missing you.

601
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,200
But I can't touch you.

602
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:12,200
Searching for the sand.

603
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,200
Becoming a firefly.

604
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:22,200
Light all the fireflies.

605
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,200
Waiting for you to leave me.

606
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,200
Only to go back to the bitter past.

607
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,200
The rules of heaven are on the path.

608
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:40,200
What's the point of living and dying?

609
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:44,200
I am alone, you are alone, I am alone

610
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:48,200
I want to live my life to see the result

611
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:52,200
Right or wrong, rumors spread

612
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:59,200
I will never let go of my destiny

613
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:04,200
For you, for me

614
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:08,200
For the rest of my life

615
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:13,200
The sea is warm, the rain falls

616
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,200
It's all about me

617
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:21,200
For you, for me

618
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:25,200
For the sake of sincerity

619
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,200
Facing the promise, we will never be apart

620
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:39,200
Use my body to light up the path
