Episode 15

6
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
My cultivation is so high for the first time, but I can't get into the election.

7
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I think someone must have done something wrong in this election.

8
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Princess, please calm down.

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Among the candidates, there is a disciple named Yu Rong Rong.

10
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
His cultivation is still usable.

11
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
As long as he and the disciples of Mount Jin can get the Blood Flower,

12
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and bring thousands of years of cultivation for the Yue Zhi Palace,

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
what's the point of not doing it?

14
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,200
Congratulations, Princess.

15
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,200
An Xue and Tan Mu Ying have been elected.

16
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,200
In our plan,

17
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,800
I never thought that slave Ye Ru Ling would also be elected.

18
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,000
Although Ye Ru Ling is not as good as An Xue,

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,800
she is the most talented among the maids who came from the Demon Citadel.

20
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Will she be our second enemy?

21
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,800
Mu Ni Sheng is talented and will definitely complete the task of the Princess.

22
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,800
She is indeed the Princess's younger sister.

23
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,800
Xie and Wan Qing, please join the election together.

24
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,200
Once we have the child of the Sima family,

25
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,200
we can then control the spirit fire in our own hands.

26
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,800
By then, as long as we kill the Sima family,

27
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,200
we can then take the child and replace him to become the master of this late manor.

28
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,400
I will bricks you up like an old baby's.

29
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,800
Anyone there?

30
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,000
Not bad.

31
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,760
What a luxurious bed!

32
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,200
The sunlight is so strong.

33
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,360
It's much better than the house I rented before.

34
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,120
Although this Qian Kun Belt is of poor quality,

35
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,120
it is a little better than the daily use.

36
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,480
You must remember to enter the Three Holy Mountains.

37
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,040
You can't make a mistake with others.

38
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,160
Just be a decent person.

39
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,960
Don't force yourself to do anything.

40
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,600
Master, master.

41
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,160
I'm not a person who can't make a move.

42
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,200
I almost got sick.

43
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,000
You're so good at pretending.

44
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,800
The Qian Kun Belt is so big.

45
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,360
I should have put all my belongings here.

46
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,200
There's a bolder one here.

47
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm so lucky to be able to get a life

48
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,440
from the evil king.

49
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,400
I mean, you, the one who sent the evil jade consort

50
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,880
with such a big sword,

51
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,440
except for your poor cultivation,

52
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,800
you didn't see anything special.

53
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,680
You haven't heard from her for so long.

54
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,240
You just need to know that only she can kill Sima Jiao.

55
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,640
Young princess, you have time to test me here.

56
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,000
Why don't you think about

57
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,560
how to use the poison in her body

58
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,280
to complete the agreement between you and me as soon as possible?

59
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,760
I didn't expect that I would have to

60
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,200
spend the holiday here.

61
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,960
Constable去了

62
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,960
Are you asleep?

63
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,200
Meritabi

64
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,960
Is it of no use to the팅

65
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,080
by合成 for cooker geezer

66
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,360
to summon him here

67
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,920
and ignore how useless he was

68
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,440
Prince of Yu grace

69
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,080
Stupid 증

70
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,140
How can I fall head over heels over a small demon

71
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,140
The spirit cup in my body is clearly wrangling

72
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,140
I want to see what he is going to do.

73
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,140
How can he sleep so soundly?

74
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,140
I'm leaving.

75
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,140
Why didn't the alarm sound?

76
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,140
The flowers are strange.

77
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,140
They will shine at night.

78
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,140
Isn't that the girl who was beaten by the shi zuo a few days ago?

79
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,140
What's wrong?

80
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,140
What's wrong?

81
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,140
What's wrong?

82
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,140
Oh no!

83
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,140
Yun rong rong's life is on fire!

84
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,140
Come back!

85
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,140
I'm Phew his soul is still here.

86
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,140
I told you to be careful

87
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,140
Why are you dead now?

88
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,140
I'm dead?

89
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,140
I saw a lot of flowers from the teacher

90
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,140
I wanted to pick one

91
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,140
Then I got here

92
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,140
Are you right, Sun and Moon will talk?

93
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,140
What a case

94
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,140
thank god The jis killed our inverter

95
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,140
There's a chance for him to escape.

96
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,140
You'd better get ready

97
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,140
and send him to escape.

98
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,140
In one day,

99
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,140
the light was out.

100
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:18,140
Master still hates him so much.

101
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,140
He still remembers the grudge from the past.

102
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,140
He will take the hatred to his disciples.

103
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:26,140
Do you think he cares about these disciples?

104
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,140
He still remembers the grudge from the past.

105
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,140
Our father and father.

106
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,140
I feel so bad.

107
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,140
Master.

108
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,140
I feel so bad.

109
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,140
Master.

110
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,140
Take out the fire in my body.

111
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,140
Master, hold on.

112
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,140
It's much better to release the blood.

113
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,140
The past eight great masters

114
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,140
drank his blood.

115
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,140
He was locked in the Three Holy Mountains for 500 years.

116
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,140
His hatred will only increase day by day.

117
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,140
Grandmaster has no mercy for them.

118
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,140
If he has a chance to eliminate us,

119
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:14,140
I'm afraid he will do more.

120
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,140
Princess Yin is right.

121
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,140
She means

122
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,140
we should start first.

123
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,140
This...

124
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,140
We should stop them now.

125
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,140
Grandmaster has fire in his body.

126
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:36,140
He is far above you.

127
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,140
If we provoke him now,

128
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:42,140
I'm afraid he will die in the end.

129
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,140
He has fire in his body now,

130
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:48,140
but the seal of the Three Holy Mountains is very strong.

131
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,140
I also hope that

132
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,140
I understand.

133
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,740
Why do you think these disciples went into the mountain?

134
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,340
They were just ordered by the old men of the Gengchen's family

135
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,540
to touch my blood

136
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,540
and follow my order.

137
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,740
They didn't dare to go into the mountain.

138
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,340
That person

139
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,540
came to me with a big plan

140
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,740
and let go of his body and heart.

141
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,740
Master...

142
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,740
Master...

143
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,740
Master...

144
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,740
Master...

145
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,740
You're watching me.

146
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,740
No, no.

147
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,740
I'm a evil eye.

148
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,740
I'm watching...

149
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,740
I'm watching over there.

150
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,740
Tell me.

151
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,740
What are you here for?

152
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,740
I'm here to adjust my acting skills, relax my body and mind,

153
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,140
and reduce my speech.

154
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,540
What's going on?

155
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,740
Why did the painting change so easily?

156
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,340
This bastard must have done this.

157
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,740
The whole world is causing me trouble.

158
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,340
There's even a painting buff here.

159
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,740
You don't want to kill me?

160
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,740
No.

161
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,140
Why don't you want to kill me?

162
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,540
I'm just a innocent fish.

163
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,140
My cultivation has fallen so low.

164
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,740
I can't think of killing you.

165
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,540
Is that so?

166
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,540
Of course.

167
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,540
Do you have any obsessive delusions?

168
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,740
Is there something wrong with your brain?

169
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,140
I'm dead.

170
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,540
This buff is too cruel.

171
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,140
Help.

172
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,140
Should I kill him or not?

173
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,740
Please give me a quick death.

174
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,940
I dare not.

175
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,540
The room is closed for too long.

176
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,140
Something's wrong with my spirit.

177
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,340
Wait.

178
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,140
The direction of the Immortal Gengchen's mansion was wrong at the beginning.

179
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,140
Why did they send a disciple to serve him?

180
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,740
I think they should send a doctor to cure his brain.

181
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,340
Go away, you stinky dog.

182
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,540
Don't lick me.

183
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,740
Brother Shu.

184
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,340
I'm thin-skinned.

185
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,540
Please spare me.

186
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,140
If you eat me, I'll have a toothache.

187
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,740
You want to drink this?

188
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,340
You should have told me earlier.

189
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,340
Here.

190
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,340
Please.

191
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,740
Sorry.

192
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,940
I'm not very thoughtful.

193
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,140
Actually,

194
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,940
this is my specialty.

195
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,140
As long as there is the spirit bamboo,

196
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,340
the spirit leaves will keep growing.

197
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,140
I usually use it as milk tea.

198
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,140
I didn't expect you to like it too.

199
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,140
The stoneHmms the switch

200
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,340
It is veryawaysough

201
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,940
to carry a huge snake as a stock of jewelry

202
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,020
The ancestors are really neol幾

203
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,740
I'm like aPMG now

204
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,140
I'm so sad.

205
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,140
I'm so sad.

206
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,140
I'm so sad.

207
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,140
You dare to drink the magic potion.

208
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,140
I'm not afraid of you.

209
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,140
I'm not afraid of you.

210
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,140
I'm not afraid of you.

211
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,140
Do you think you've lived for too long?

212
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,140
You just went there to eat and drink twice.

213
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,140
Now you're speaking for him.

214
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,140
Everyone is greedy.

215
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,140
Not to mention the devil.

216
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,140
Not to take away the spirit fire.

217
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,140
But to steal the blood lilies.

218
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,140
He's just better than others.

219
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,140
He seems very quicklycle victir of the Yuelun Court.

220
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,140
Misheng Shigu,

221
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,140
Xinzhu YouTube was grayed out.

222
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,140
No one saw him and

223
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,140
he kept missing the burn body.

224
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,140
Now he couldn't go back.

225
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,140
exposing the results of the trial.

226
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,140
Everyoneivities are not normal.

227
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,140
Stay calm and calm.

228
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,140
Let's save lives Susan,

229
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:33,120
If one of us can get the

230
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,120
Master's favor and become the Lady of the Master,

231
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,120
then our Tian Zhi Palace

232
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,120
will be able to become the head of the Eighth Palace.

233
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,120
Si Ma Jiao is indeed as cruel and immoral

234
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,120
as the Princess said.

235
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,120
We must find out his weakness

236
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,120
and kill him as soon as possible.

237
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,120
The Phoenix Mountain and the Fire Spirit

238
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,120
have been integrated into Si Ma Jiao.

239
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,120
If Si Ma Jiao dies,

240
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,120
the Fire Spirit will also be extinguished.

241
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,120
In this way,

242
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,120
the whole Geng Chen's house

243
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,120
will not be able to generate spiritual energy.

244
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,120
How can we cultivate it?

245
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,120
The blood lilies

246
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,120
are grown by the blood of the four horses

247
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,120
that are absorbed by the fire.

248
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,120
After eating the blood of the blood lilies and Si Ma Jiao,

249
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,120
we can still improve our cultivation.

250
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,120
Have you forgotten what the Princess said?

251
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,120
She offended Si Ma Jiao that year.

252
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,120
If one day,

253
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,120
she is unhappy and wants to turn the tide,

254
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,120
we will all die.

255
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,120
How can we cultivate it?

256
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,120
You called me here

257
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,120
just to discuss

258
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,120
this impossible thing.

259
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,120
Ye Ru Ling,

260
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,120
don't look so depressed.

261
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,120
Don't forget

262
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,120
that your clan

263
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,120
is still in the hands of the Princess.

264
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,120
I have arranged it for Brother Snake.

265
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,120
I hope he won't wake me up tonight

266
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,120
and let me sleep in a stable place.

267
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,120
What's the matter?

268
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,120
I must find the rescueroom.

269
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,120
What's wrong with my feeling

270
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,120
that I feel familiar?

271
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,120
Yes.

272
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,120
Didn't Ming Ly say

273
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,680
that half of her life can be used to

274
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,200
drink the poison of the stone bone of Liao Ting Yan?

275
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,520
Why didn't she respond

276
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,840
when she heard the summon?

277
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,200
This Liao Ting Yan,

278
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,680
does she really think that

279
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,000
she can get rid of us

280
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,920
by climbing the Sima Jiao?

281
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,080
Okay.

282
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,080
I can see the poison of the stone bone.

283
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,280
How many times can you endure it?

284
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,160
Stupid snake.

285
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,200
What did you bring back?

286
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,200
She was poisoned.

287
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,680
Why did you want to save her?

288
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,640
Do you know what she is here for?

289
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,000
You brought her to me

290
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,320
without knowing anything.

291
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,840
Do you want to die?

292
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,280
This poison

293
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,080
is just a small trick

294
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,480
used by the Demon Citadel

295
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,720
to manipulate the puppets.

296
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,480
She instantly fell asleep.

297
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,440
The one wanted by the Demon after so manyills

298
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,440
turned out to be

299
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,840
someone like that.

300
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,000
It seems that

301
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,360
she's smarter than

302
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,240
those idiots.

303
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,600
She wasn't only

304
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,080
looking for death

305
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,200
but also downloaded

306
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,760
that stupid snake

307
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,960
with such deep heart.

308
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,680
Her face � ahead with her plight.

309
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,360
No wonder she wants to die.

310
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,220
sound good on your face.

311
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:54,720
You finally see a better 있는 face,!

312
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,360
Mei Chang, you are indeed rewarding!

313
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,360
Senior Elder Brother, don't you think

314
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,600
Senior Brother should try no hand.

315
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,500
It is not about filming.

316
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:07,400
You should try walking to the proceeded scene.

317
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,720
If you don't try it,

318
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,160
and you end up being humiliated like a prisoner child again,

319
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,580
Mr. Zhan's exam is coming up.

320
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,440
Think about it.

321
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,240
You have already seen what your new father has achieved

322
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,720
now that it is at that time.

323
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,720
Why am I in your palace?

324
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,720
You did well.

325
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,720
How dare you use that stupid snake

326
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,720
to bring you to my center.

327
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,720
I guess it's because last night I had a stomachache.

328
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,720
I passed out and then Brother Snake was worried about me.

329
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,720
He wanted you to save me.

330
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,720
I didn't want to hide it from you.

331
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,720
My stomach doesn't hurt anymore.

332
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,720
If you drink my blood,

333
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,720
it won't hurt anymore.

334
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,720
I drank your blood?

335
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,720
If you dare to vomit, I'll kill you.

336
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,720
Your blood has the function of painkiller.

337
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,720
I'm not sure if it's because of the pain.

338
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,720
I'm just worried about you.

339
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,720
Does it have the function of painkiller?

340
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,720
Not only can it help you with pain,

341
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,720
it can also improve your cultivation.

342
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,720
No one in this world doesn't want it.

343
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,720
Don't blame me.

344
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,720
I don't really want it.

345
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,720
The way you look now

346
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,720
makes me want to kill you immediately.

347
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,720
No, no, no, no.

348
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,720
I'm afraid that I'll dirty your hands.

349
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,720
I...

350
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,720
Since it's so painful,

351
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,720
why don't you kill me?

352
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,720
If there's no grudge,

353
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,720
no guilt, no grudge,

354
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,720
I don't need to kill you.

355
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,720
In this world, killing people

356
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,720
doesn't need grudges.

357
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,720
It doesn't need any grudges.

358
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,720
For example, now,

359
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,720
there's no grudge, no grudge, no guilt.

360
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,720
I just want to kill you.

361
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,720
What can you do?

362
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,720
I can't be so wronged.

363
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,720
I can't beat you.

364
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,720
I can't beat you.

365
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,720
You want me to kill you,

366
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,720
but I won't kill you.

367
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,720
In the future,

368
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,720
I'll let you serve me.

369
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,720
Me?

370
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,720
I'll go first.

371
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,720
No grudge, no grudge,

372
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,720
no guilt,

373
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,720
you don't want to kill me?

374
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,720
Who's the one who's the first to die?

375
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,720
Why don't you remember my blood?

376
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,720
If I wasn't the only one who could feed the spirit,

377
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,720
if the spirit could feed itself,

378
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,720
if the spirit could feed itself,

379
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,720
the whole Gengchen's house,

380
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,720
if they couldn't beat me,

381
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,720
I would have been killed.

382
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,720
I've been trying to destroy the Gengchen's house.

383
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,720
I've been trying to destroy the spirit.

384
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,720
I should kill myself.

385
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,720
Why?

386
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,720
He doesn't want to kill me.

387
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,720
I'm so happy today.

388
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,720
I'm sure I can't sleep well tonight.

389
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,720
It's ridiculous.

390
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,720
The answer to Zhenyin's question

391
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,720
is not fake.

392
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,720
If he really didn't mean to kill me,

393
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,720
maybe I could use him.

394
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,720
Five hundred years.

395
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,720
New moon night.

396
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,720
Aunt,

397
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,720
we've been waiting under the central tower.

398
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,720
But this door has never been opened for us.

399
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,720
Will the master really see us?

400
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,720
Are you as humble as those people?

401
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,720
If you're afraid, just go.

402
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,720
No, aunt.

403
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,720
I just don't know how to face the master.

404
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,720
The princess once said

405
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,720
it's impossible to hide yourself in front of the master.

406
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,720
We just need to show our humble and sincere attitude

407
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,720
and show our thoughts to him.

408
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,720
As long as I keep going,

409
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,720
the master will be touched by me.

410
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,720
Brother Shuo is so kind.

411
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,720
I haven't had a good rest for a few days.

412
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,720
I have to work again.

413
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,720
I'm here to see you.

414
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,720
Please accept me.

415
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,720
What a brave man!

416
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,720
He asked me to face that cruel master.

417
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,720
No wonder he's the leader.

418
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,720
This is not what I want.

419
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,720
I wish I could exchange with him.

420
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,720
Hi.

421
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,720
You're still alive.

422
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,720
What's wrong with you?

423
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,720
You always say that when you see me.

424
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,720
I'm not dead.

425
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,720
I'm still alive.

426
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,720
If you want to be alive,

427
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,720
stay away from here.

428
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,720
I want to.

429
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,720
What's wrong with the master?

430
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,720
He asked me to work

431
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,720
but he didn't give me a pass.

432
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,720
How can I get in?

433
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,720
Master, I'm afraid that

434
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,720
he doesn't understand your temper.

435
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,720
Should we remind him?

436
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,720
Why do you care about him?

437
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,720
Only you and me can stay in such a remote place.

438
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,720
He's going to die under this tower today.

439
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,720
Master, I'm here to work.

440
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,720
How could this be?

441
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,720
Can we enter through this door?

442
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,720
How did that disciple get in?

443
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,720
I wonder what the master will ask me to do.

444
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,720
What's that?

445
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,720
These are my daily daily necessities.

446
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:31,100
I got them from the

447
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:44,720
Master, did the person outside die?

448
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,720
What do you think?

449
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,720
Why did you kill him?

450
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,720
Compared to those greedy people who can see through it,

451
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,720
I hate those who have lost their minds and souls.

452
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,720
I can't even bring up the interest in killing him.

453
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,720
Then why?

454
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,720
He's too noisy.

455
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,720
It makes me a little annoyed.

456
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,720
Are you going to kill him if you're annoyed?

457
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,720
This is so easy.

458
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,720
I'm so tired.

459
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,720
I'm so tired.

460
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,720
I'm so tired.

461
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,720
You can't walk anymore?

462
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,720
Master, I have a question.

463
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,720
Why are we going up so high?

464
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,720
We're not going to do anything.

465
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,720
It seems that the ancestors are too bored.

466
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,720
They want to kill me.

467
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,720
I used to be able to be a person at least when I went to work.

468
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,720
I can only be a leader's toy when I come to work in the world of the immortal.

469
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,720
You clean the bed first.

470
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,720
I'll go to the second floor.

471
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,720
Let's not talk about it.

472
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,720
This view is pretty good.

473
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,720
It's just that the master is very happy.

474
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,720
It's a little bit of a break from the work experience.

475
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,720
But in this high tower, it's been closed for 500 years.

476
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,720
The character is distorted.

477
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,720
It's not strange.

478
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,720
Master, look how hard I work.

479
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,720
I'm working.

480
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,720
Senior Brother, it's you.

481
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,720
I thought the boss was here to check the port.

482
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,720
I was scared.

483
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,720
What do you mean?

484
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,720
Are you going to take me somewhere?

485
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,720
Or what's wrong with the master?

486
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,720
I'm going to the second floor.

487
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,720
I'm going to the third floor.

488
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,720
I'm going to the third floor.

489
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,720
I'm going to the third floor.

490
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,720
I'm going to the third floor.

491
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,720
I'm going to the third floor.

492
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,720
I'm going to the third floor.

493
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,720
He just left me here.

494
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,720
He didn't tell me the time and time of the upper and lower classes.

495
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,720
Are you going to take me to the master?

496
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,720
If you don't seal it, you'll wipe out the whole blood.

497
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,720
Master.

498
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,720
The spirit fire has been integrated with him.

499
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,720
As long as he lives,

500
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,720
just provide us with the spirit energy.

501
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,720
Why don't you add another ban on sealing it?

502
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,720
This ban can suppress his whole meridians

503
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,720
so that he can't kill himself.

504
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,720
No matter how painful he is, he can't die.

505
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,720
Master.

506
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,720
Master.

507
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,720
Master.

508
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,720
Master.

509
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,720
Master.

510
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,720
Master.

511
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,720
Master.

512
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,720
Master.

513
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,720
Master.

514
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,720
Master.

515
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,720
Master.

516
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,720
Master.

517
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,720
Master.

518
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,720
Master.

519
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,720
Master.

520
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,720
Master.

521
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,720
Master.

522
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,720
Master.

523
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,720
Master.

524
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,720
Master.

525
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,720
Master.

526
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,720
Master.

527
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,720
Master.

528
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,720
Master.

529
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,720
Master.

530
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,720
Master.

531
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,720
Master.

532
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,720
Master.

533
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,720
Master, please spare my life.

534
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,720
I didn't do anything.

535
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,720
Your pet brought me in.

536
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,720
Master.

537
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,720
I'm weak.

538
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,720
I can't help you.

539
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,720
How about I get off work first?

540
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,720
What's going on?

541
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,720
Master.

542
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,720
Are you having a fever?

543
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,720
Let me check.

544
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,720
Master.

545
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,720
Master, please listen to me.

546
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,720
Your pet brought me in.

547
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,720
I didn't do anything to offend you.

548
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:35,720
He can change the pain of the firefly that brought me.

549
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,720
Master.

550
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,720
Master.

551
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,720
Master.

552
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,720
Master.

553
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,720
Master.

554
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,720
Master.

555
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,720
Master.

556
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,720
Master.

557
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,720
Master.

558
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,720
Master.

559
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,720
