1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'll never return to this world.

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We can't let go of such a great opportunity.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We can't let go of such a great opportunity.

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'll do what you can't do for you.

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'll do what you can't do for you.

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
When Liao Tingye dies,

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'll take his inner alchemy

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and take the village chief home.

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'll take the village chief home.

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Episode 2

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,800
Since the ancestors said they would take care of me,

26
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,000
I shouldn't be in trouble, right?

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,600
What kind of five-star hotel is this?

28
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,600
I'm so jealous.

29
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,800
If only I could stay there for a day.

30
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,000
I could pay for it.

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Anyway, I should be able to live for a long time with the grandmaster.

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,800
I think I still have a lot of good stuff to enjoy.

33
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,400
You...

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,200
Once Yuan Che releases the signal,

35
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,800
we'll go with the others.

36
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Yes, madam.

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,200
Someone is coming.

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,200
They're finally here.

39
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,000
Why isn't the grandmaster here?

40
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,200
It seems that he has figured out our plan.

41
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,400
If he did, why would he come?

42
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,400
This is a banquet prepared for you.

43
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,400
In order to kill you.

44
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,200
Indeed,

45
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,000
you should wear this. Everything is as usual.

46
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,400
Why isn't the grandmaster here?

47
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,800
This witch has ruined our formation.

48
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,000
Let's arrest her first.

49
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,600
Did we misunderstand something? I'm not a witch.

50
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,200
Witch, stop fighting.

51
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm not a witch.

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm not a witch.

53
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm not a witch.

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm not a witch.

55
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,600
Where are you running?

56
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,600
Grandmaster!

57
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
How did I suddenly become so powerful?

58
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,800
Are you teaching them a lesson for me?

59
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,000
Let's go.

60
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,800
Where?

61
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,000
To death.

62
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,600
What?

63
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,280
Can all blue

64
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,600
be used as jam and food to suck the air?

65
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,080
Why are you still suffering?

66
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,600
Is that your husband?

67
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,520
Is that correct?

68
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I will explain it to you again and again.

69
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You must be cautious.

70
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Don't be angry for the first time.

71
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
If she is the one who is with the Grand Master,

72
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
everything will be much easier.

73
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So I have to find a way to meet the Grand Master.

74
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
If I can please him,

75
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
maybe I can help my mother get through the difficulties.

76
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But only Liao Tianyuan

77
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
in the people of Mount Jin

78
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
has entered the Grand Master's speech.

79
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You mean...

80
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I am not even as good as the trash of the Three-Folk Tree.

81
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Young Princess.

82
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Spare me.

83
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Young Princess.

84
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You can't just go with the flow.

85
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's not me.

86
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I can't control this waste.

87
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's strange.

88
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Why did this waste stop suddenly?

89
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Someone is coming.

90
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
That is...

91
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Grand Master.

92
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Greetings, Grand Master.

93
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
This is a nice place.

94
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's a good place to kill people.

95
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Is Grand Master going to kill Liao Tianyuan here?

96
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You are lucky to die in my flying cage.

97
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Grand Master.

98
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I am willing to work for you.

99
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Don't get your hands dirty.

100
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You are from Yuezhi Palace?

101
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yes.

102
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I am the daughter of the Princess of Yuezhi Palace.

103
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's not good for you to come here

104
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
and drive the master away.

105
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The Eight Grand Masters and Grand Masters

106
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
were taken away from my private horse.

107
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Not only a flying cage.

108
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You left me here alone?

109
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Isn't this the flying cage I saw during the day?

110
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I am directly in the five-star hotel.

111
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
The view is amazing.

112
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Did they install a monitor for me?

113
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
How did they know I wanted to turn on the monitor?

114
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I am so happy.

115
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I am so happy.

116
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I am so happy.

117
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I am so happy.

118
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I am so happy.

119
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
How did they know I wanted to live here?

120
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Grand Master.

121
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You princesses have created such a big battle.

122
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You princesses have created such a big battle.

123
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You can't even defeat a demon jade spy.

124
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It seems that the Eight Grand Masters should be the winner.

125
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Grand Master.

126
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What you mean is

127
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
that Liao Ting Yan is a demon jade spy.

128
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Don't you know that?

129
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Then why did you create such a big battle today?

130
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
For whom?

131
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
We just found out.

132
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I wonder how Grand Master

133
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
wants to deal with Liao Ting Yan.

134
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
To draw a line

135
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
to draw a line

136
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
to draw a line.

137
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I will imprison her first.

138
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Such a good Buddha's law.

139
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I am willing to live here for a month.

140
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Then use fire

141
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
to roast the meat.

142
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It will be eaten in a while.

143
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Throw it into the cold pool and soak it.

144
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
What kind of human is this?

145
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
In the end,

146
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
you will be swallowed by the beast.

147
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You will never see the sun again.

148
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Good.

149
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It is indeed a five-star hotel.

150
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So comfortable.

151
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Then where is Liao Ting Yan's body?

152
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
There is no body.

153
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
In such a cold weather,

154
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
the body is definitely gone.

155
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
A mere demon jade spy

156
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
can die in the hands of the master.

157
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It is also considered that he has a death.

158
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Get lost.

159
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Get lost.

160
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Get lost.

161
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Grand Master.

162
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Although Liao Ting Yan made a big mistake,

163
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
he is still a disciple of the disciple.

164
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Please, Grand Master,

165
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
let me bury him.

166
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You said there was no body.

167
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
What to bury?

168
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You are saying that

169
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Grand Master killed the demon jade person himself.

170
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Yes, he said so.

171
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
That's why I want to confirm it.

172
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Mother.

173
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Chu Hui. Mother, I finally found you.

174
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
That Liao Ting Yan finally died.

175
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Chu Hui, what did you see?

176
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Just now, I carried the white bird

177
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
to the nearby White Fall Cliff.

178
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Grand Master suddenly took Liao Ting Yan to the bed.

179
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And his attitude towards him was extremely cruel.

180
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
He said that the bird cage is suitable for killing people.

181
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
This bird cage is not bad.

182
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It is a good place to kill people.

183
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Liao Ting Yan is so scared.

184
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I wanted to kill him for Grand Master,

185
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
but Grand Master seems to have to kill him himself.

186
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It is true.

187
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I thought that this dead horse was trying to trick us.

188
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Why do you have to guess?

189
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Just look at the life light and you will know it is real or fake.

190
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Grand Master.

191
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Grand Master, Liao Ting Yan's life light

192
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
suddenly went out.

193
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
We can't find it.

194
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It seems that the person who was in the prison of the devil is really dead.

195
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Even the soul of the god has been destroyed.

196
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It is a pity that without Liao Ting Yan's help,

197
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
we are not the opponents of Grand Master.

198
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
He didn't die long ago.

199
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
But he died at this time.

200
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I think that's all for today.

201
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Everyone, please go back first.

202
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Wait, everyone.

203
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Grand Master, you still have some doubts.

204
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Everyone, the day Grand Master broke the seal,

205
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
everyone was watching.

206
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
How much protection does he have?

207
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Liao Ting Yan.

208
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Qi Rong, you are being too presumptuous in front of me.

209
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
What are you afraid of?

210
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I won't let you die, so you won't die.

211
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
He has been cruel since he was a child.

212
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
He is not an exception to anyone.

213
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
He protected you yesterday, but today he may not protect you.

214
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
How about this?

215
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I will make sure that the person who was in the prison of the devil is completely eliminated.

216
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I suggest that everyone

217
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
go to Bailu Ya again.

218
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
If the person who was in the prison of the devil is still alive,

219
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
right now,

220
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
he is the one who thought that he had cheated us

221
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
and was most relaxed.

222
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
If we investigate the details at this time,

223
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
we will definitely get something.

224
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Grand Master, you are quite straightforward.

225
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
If you dare to ask the Immortal Geng Chen,

226
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
who dares to break into the place where the Grand Master is?

227
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Then, only Grand Master

228
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
will come to meet us.

229
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I am willing to go to Bailu Ya

230
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
to visit Grand Master.

231
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Good.

232
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Princess Yuan,

233
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
you must be very careful

234
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
in this trip.

235
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Don't worry, Grand Master.

236
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
We must immediately inform the Grand Master

237
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
about this matter.

238
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Please wait, Princess Yuan.

239
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Princess Yuan, I cannot let you

240
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
risk your life alone.

241
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I will take a few disciples

242
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
to go with you

243
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
to ensure that nothing is lost.

244
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Listen well.

245
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
As soon as you enter Bailu Ya,

246
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
immediately search for the details of the person who was in the prison of the devil.

247
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Once you discover it,

248
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
take it immediately.

249
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Yes.

250
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Let's go.

251
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Tell me, what are you doing?

252
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,520
Relax and enjoy the vacation.

253
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,200
You don't want to kill me?

254
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:12,920
No.

255
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,360
Why not?

256
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,600
I'm just an innocent girl.

257
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,800
But I have an idea.

258
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,800
Maybe it can make you happy.

259
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,600
I made it.

260
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,400
I'll improve your cultivation.

261
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,880
You can use it to do this.

262
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,160
It can make you happy.

263
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,040
Isn't it good?

264
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,800
Actually, this is not my home.

265
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,520
And it's not a familiar place.

266
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,480
I often make some murders.

267
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,400
Luckily, you're here.

268
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,960
I can make a good music in such a bad environment.

269
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,480
Weak Guards

270
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,120
Hurry up.

271
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,800
They are inside.

272
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,800
Master.

273
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,480
Master, what...

274
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,320
Who are..

275
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,320
I dare to break in.

276
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,320
Do you want to taste the taste of the remains?

277
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,320
Please don't be angry.

278
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:50,320
I just feel that the smell of the jade is still there.

279
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,320
I'm here to tell you that I'm worried about your safety.

280
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,320
Since you like to be so careless,

281
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,320
come and clean this place.

282
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,320
Yes.

283
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,320
I'm here.

284
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,320
There's only one thing in the room that has the scent of Liao Ting Yan.

285
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,320
It seems that this person has really been killed.

286
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,320
If you dare to break in again,

287
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,320
you don't need to be the leader anymore.

288
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,320
I know my mistakes.

289
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,320
Let's go.

290
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,320
Go.

291
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,320
You shot me.

292
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,320
What did you do?

293
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,320
What's wrong?

294
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,320
What happened?

295
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,320
We can't go back to Mo Yu anymore.

296
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,320
Si Ma Jiao killed Liao Ting Yan.

297
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,320
There was no more bones,

298
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,320
no more coldness,

299
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,320
no more internal organs.

300
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,320
What did you say?

301
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,320
Everyone heard Si Ma Jiao say it.

302
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,320
He only found out that Liao Ting Yan is from Mo Yu.

303
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,320
So he killed him.

304
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,320
Liao Ting Yan's life was destroyed.

305
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,320
Si Ma Jiao has saved Ting Yan many times.

306
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,320
And after he left the mountain, he spent every day with her.

307
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,320
His love for her must have increased.

308
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,320
Will he really kill her?

309
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,320
Sister,

310
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,320
Liao Ting Yan is dead now.

311
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,320
Maybe we should consider

312
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,320
to start from Si Ma Jiao.

313
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,320
No.

314
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,320
If we risk our lives to kill her under the eyes of our ancestors,

315
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,320
it will only cause the whole Yanzhi Palace to be destroyed.

316
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,320
What does Yanzhi Palace have to do with you?

317
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,320
You won't be the one who is greedy for the throne.

318
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,320
You forgot your mother's last wish.

319
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,320
You forgot the people of the clan are waiting for you to take them home.

320
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,320
How dare you!

321
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,320
Princess, the black snake who is with the Grand Master

322
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,320
is asking to see you in the main hall.

323
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,320
I won't see him.

324
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,320
Go and report to him.

325
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,320
Tell him to go see him now.

326
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,320
Yes.

327
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,320
Father, Si Ma Jiao was cruel and cruel.

328
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,320
Liao Ting Yan was just a joke.

329
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,320
Killing her is not a big deal.

330
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,320
What are you still worried about?

331
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,320
Do you think Si Ma Jiao already knows

332
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,320
that we are going to seal her?

333
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,320
Otherwise, why didn't she go to the Qing Gu Heaven to seal her?

334
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,320
If Si Ma Jiao doesn't care about Liao Ting Yan,

335
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,320
it's reasonable that she doesn't come with him.

336
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,320
If she knew about the seal,

337
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,320
she would have gone crazy.

338
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,320
The seal has been sealed for a lifetime.

339
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,320
It's not done yet.

340
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:10,320
I really feel uneasy.

341
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,320
Is there any news from Chiyan City?

342
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,320
Not yet.

343
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,320
But Father, don't worry.

344
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,320
Everything is in plan.

345
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,320
Ru Ling!

346
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,320
Ru Ling!

347
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,320
No, no.

348
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,320
Greetings, Princess Ying.

349
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,320
You can leave first.

350
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,320
What's going on with Ting Yan?

351
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,320
Did the Crown Prince really kill her?

352
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,320
Let's sit down and talk.

353
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,320
Come.

354
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,320
Ru Ling, I think Ting Yan is not dead.

355
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,320
Really? Then where is she now?

356
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,320
She is now...

357
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,320
I don't know where she is now.

358
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,320
I think the Grand Master must have a way to let her live.

359
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,320
I just don't want others to know where Ting Yan is.

360
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,320
You mean Ting Yan is not with the Grand Master?

361
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,320
Then I can be more at ease.

362
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,320
But you are a man after all.

363
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,320
Don't come to me for three days.

364
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,320
I will be criticized.

365
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,320
What are you doing?

366
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,320
Please accept me as your disciple.

367
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,320
This is not a place for you to make trouble.

368
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,320
Get up.

369
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,320
I am not making trouble.

370
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,320
Ru Ling, if I become your disciple,

371
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,320
I will have a reason to see you every day.

372
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,320
Others can't talk nonsense anymore.

373
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,320
So...

374
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,320
Please become my master.

375
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,320
You are practicing the spiritual power of the Grand Master.

376
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,320
What can I teach you?

377
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,320
Teach me how to be a human.

378
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,320
What are you doing?

379
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,320
I am serious.

380
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,320
You know that I have just become a human.

381
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,320
I still have a lot of principles to learn.

382
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,320
So can you become my master?

383
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,320
Okay?

384
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,320
Okay?

385
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,320
With this skill,

386
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,320
I can improve my own cultivation.

387
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,320
Why waste time teaching you?

388
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,320
Because if I learn something,

389
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,320
I can definitely become your capable assistant.

390
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,320
You can also use me to get what you want.

391
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,320
What do you mean?

392
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,320
I remember that Ting Yan said that

393
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,320
you tried your best to be the Princess.

394
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,320
You have the power to achieve what you want.

395
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,320
You have the ability to accomplish what you want.

396
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,320
You also have the goal to achieve.

397
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,320
I can help you achieve all these.

398
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,320
Sister,

399
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,320
he is a guard of Sima Jiao.

400
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,320
You must use this chess well.

401
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,320
I will do my best.

402
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,320
You must use this chess well.

403
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,320
You believe me?

404
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,320
Okay, then follow me.

405
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,320
I will tell you what I want to do.

406
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,320
Hurry up!

407
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,320
Get up!

408
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,320
Hurry up!

409
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,320
But...

410
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,320
The people here are the soldiers of the late King of the devils.

411
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,320
The Fulong that the stupid witch brought back.

412
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,320
They can barely touch the spiritual vein.

413
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,320
They are the ones who are the most powerful.

414
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,320
How can this be?

415
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,320
They are obviously the citizens of the late King.

416
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,320
They shouldn't have been treated like this.

417
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,320
There will be no more abuse.

418
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,320
I have already talked to the elder.

419
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,320
I have already talked to the elder.

420
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
They also all have the same old habits as me.

421
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,320
They all have the same old habits as me.

422
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,320
They all have the same old habits as me.

423
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,320
That's why I am the one who is the most powerful.

424
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,320
That's why I am the most powerful.

425
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,320
They are all the same old habits as me.

426
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,320
What are you talking about?

427
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,720
I've discussed with the elders for a long time.

428
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,720
Finally, we can get rid of their farmland.

429
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,320
So today is the last day

430
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:53,320
for them to be in the slaughterhouse.

431
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,520
Lu Li.

432
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,400
Your past must be very sad.

433
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,400
Kid.

434
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,600
You must remember.

435
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,200
No matter how hard it is in the future,

436
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,280
you must find a way

437
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,280
to lead the people back to their homeland.

438
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,080
But fortunately,

439
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,680
you've done such a great thing

440
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,880
for your people.

441
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,680
But

442
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,480
for most of them,

443
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,400
if they can't go back to the hell,

444
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,400
can't go back home,

445
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,000
then it's meaningless

446
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,600
to survive anywhere.

447
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,480
I brought you here

448
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,680
to tell you

449
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,680
to let my people

450
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,960
live the life they want.

451
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,960
That's what I'm thinking.

452
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,560
I'll help you.

453
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,160
Really?

454
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,560
Yes.

455
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,760
Although you say you're not used to being a human,

456
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,760
you don't know human nature,

457
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,760
in my opinion,

458
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,760
you're actually more honest than a human.

459
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,760
I'm not.

460
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,760
Really?

461
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,360
You're praising me like this.

462
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,360
I'm embarrassed.

463
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,960
If you really help me,

464
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,160
I'll give you a corresponding return.

465
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,360
You mean...

466
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,360
I'm willing to be your teacher.

467
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,560
Teacher?

468
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,560
Please accept my bow.

469
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,760
Okay.

470
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,560
Since I'm your teacher,

471
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,360
I'll give you a name.

472
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,760
Okay.

473
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,360
Since you're a black snake,

474
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,960
and you're 29 when you're human,

475
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,360
then you can be Black Nine.

476
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,760
How about it?

477
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,960
You actually remember the day I was a human.

478
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,560
It's not hard to remember.

479
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,880
Nine.

480
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,160
I like this name.

481
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,360
It's good that you like it.

482
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,080
I'm so tired.

483
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,200
Master,

484
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,080
why does he look so big?

485
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,680
The hands he gave birth to are so big.

486
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,680
He's like a giant.

487
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,680
What is this?

488
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,680
Why did I turn into a stone tower?

489
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,680
What?

490
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,680
Hey! Why did you turn me into this?

491
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,680
Help me turn back!

492
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,680
My long legs are so beautiful!

493
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,680
It's not me who turned you into this.

494
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,680
It's you who want to turn into this.

495
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,680
You're talking nonsense!

496
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,680
You're a big pig! You're talking nonsense!

497
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,680
I gave you a hallucination pill.

498
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,680
It will make you look like the most impressive person in your heart.

499
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,680
The water tower is the most beautiful.

500
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,680
It must be beautiful.

501
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,680
Why?

502
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,680
I can't feel this beautiful hand.

503
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,680
Instead, I need to change into a dead horse's footwear

504
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,680
and become a dragon.

505
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,680
Help me turn back.

506
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,680
The hallucination pill will make you look like this for three months.

507
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,680
Can you move your precious hand?

508
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,680
I'm still alive!

509
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,680
Here.

510
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,880
Can you move your noble hand?

511
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,000
I'm a human, not a pillow, okay?

512
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,040
Pillow?

513
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:17,840
It's good to be able to hold a sleeping pillow.

514
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,200
Why are you giving me a hallucination pill?

515
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,160
Now that you're in the eyes of an outsider,

516
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,000
you're already dead.

517
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,920
Or else, sooner or later, you'll die in the hands of that old thief from the Poetry School.

518
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,440
Isn't he your guardian?

519
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,720
He looks so modest and modest.

520
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,320
It's just a look.

521
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,840
So you're doing this for me?

522
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,960
But Sui Ta is too much!

523
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,280
I think he's just a primary school student.

524
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:49,760
Primary school students aren't used like that.

525
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,360
Forget it.

526
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,480
If sleeping can improve your cultivation,

527
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,560
you will surely be able to bear the burden of the Gengchen family.

528
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,880
Okay.

529
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,880
Where did this little rascal come from?

530
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,720
He's so close to the Grand Teacher.

531
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,840
Grand Teacher, I now have a new name.

532
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,720
It's Black Ninth.

533
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,960
That sounds good! Congratulations, Ninth!

534
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,240
What are you doing?

535
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,440
What does that have to do with you?

536
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,600
With a name, you're still that stupid snake.

537
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,240
Grand Teacher, you really value Ting Yan so much.

538
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,760
You probably didn't really kill her, right?

539
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,920
I still haven't told Ting Yan my new name.

540
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,720
If you still can't find out what I told you,

541
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,480
I will kill you.

542
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,080
Grand Teacher, please spare my life.

543
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,600
I already found that girl.

544
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,800
She's the secret blood of the Yinzhi Palace.

545
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,840
I also asked Ru Ling.

546
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,800
Ru Ling said that she also hasn't seen the secret blood for many days.

547
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,440
But her life light is still there.

548
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,000
She probably isn't dead yet. She just got hidden.

549
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:08,800
But I brought a lot of things that are left in the Yinzhi Palace.

550
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,840
Let's see if we can use them.

551
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,040
She doesn't wash her soul and doesn't wipe her mouth.

552
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,280
This doesn't seem like the style of Shi Qian Lü.

553
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,840
What is so special about this secret blood

554
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,120
that she is so generous and generous?

555
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:33,120
Could it be that Shi Qian Lü likes the secret blood and has ulterior motives?

556
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,680
You guessed it right.

557
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:47,000
This Shi Qian Lü is so old-fashioned.

558
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,520
Stupid snake.

559
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,920
This is something that Shi Zhen Xu touched.

560
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,320
What?

561
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,320
So it was Shi Zhen Xu who hid the secret blood.

562
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:13,760
He is the real

563
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,360
Let the news out.

564
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,760
Just say that we are looking for the secret blood.

565
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,560
Yes.

566
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,960
Maybe,

567
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,760
Shi Zhen Xu is the real Shi Qian Lü.

568
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,560
We did it.

569
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,560
The spirit of the spirit fire has been activated.

570
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,760
We did it.

571
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,160
Congratulations, Father. The spirit fire has been activated.

572
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,360
You have taken a step closer to our plan.

573
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,760
The defeat is in the Purple-Sweat Bureau.

574
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,160
Hurry and go to Chiyan City to hurry up.

575
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,760
Don't worry, Father. I will not disappoint you.

576
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,560
Four-Horse Cult, you haven't been here for a long time.

577
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,560
You will stay here for a while.

578
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,560
Once Father's plan is complete,

579
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,960
we will both be free and free.

580
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,760
I will wait for you to come back.

581
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,960
I am leaving.

582
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,160
Sect Leader.

583
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:46,160
Do you know that Si Ma Jiao is looking for you everywhere?

584
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,760
Zhen Xu,

585
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:55,760
he hasn't given you the Soul-Washing Spell yet, right?

586
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,360
I will be careful today.

587
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,960
I will not be discovered by Si Ma Jiao.

588
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,160
Very good.

589
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,760
Go.

590
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,760
Thank you, Sect Leader.

591
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,160
Only the dead

592
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,360
will never be discovered.

593
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,920
Thank you, Leader.

594
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,800
wire frame

595
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,360
your soul.

596
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:26,820
Don't be reasonable, come with me find a way to kill the grey-haired thousand- misleading

597
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,300
What do you want to know?

598
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,860
You know nothing about the secret blood.

599
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,740
Please avenge me

600
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,620
and kill Shi Qianli.

601
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,740
What is Shi Qianli and Shi Zhenxu

602
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,380
planning?

603
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:40,580
Shi...

604
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,380
I don't know.

605
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,740
Where is Shi Zhenxu?

606
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,220
In the lab,

607
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:52,660
he's looking for the man with a fire.

608
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,900
Why is he looking for the man with a fire?

609
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,420
Grandmaster,

610
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,300
is he dead?

611
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:14,440
His soul is in a state of

612
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,100
death.

613
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,140
Shi Qianli is too cruel.

614
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,500
Now I finally understand

615
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:24,500
what Shi Zhenxu means by

616
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,780
killing the man with a fire.

617
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,860
Tell me.

618
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,780
You knew that

619
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,620
Shi Qianli was dissatisfied with

620
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,260
Shi Zhenxu and Dark Snow.

621
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,740
So he released the news

622
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,260
that we were looking for Dark Snow.

623
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,100
You knew that

624
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,780
he would kill Dark Snow

625
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,420
while he was dissatisfied with it.

626
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,860
You asked me to put my spiritual power

627
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,300
into Dark Snow's life light.

628
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,220
So you waited for this day.

629
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,500
You've improved a lot.

630
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,260
Now you don't even alswer to this day,

631
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,260
what good you would have done?

632
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,540
Is this good,

633
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:01,940
or not?

634
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,100
Tell me.

635
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,940
Tell me clearly.

636
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,140
Grandmaster,

637
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,500
this is from Ting Yan.

638
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,220
You won't really kill Ting Yan, right?

639
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:17,980
Grand Master,

640
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,740
explain it to him.

641
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,740
I won't kill him.

642
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,140
Others will kill him too.

643
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,740
He will die sooner or later.

644
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,060
Let him free earlier.

645
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:30,780
I don't believe it.

646
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,940
Grand Master won't kill Ting Yan.

647
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:37,020
Grand Master must have protected Ting Yan, right?

648
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:37,540
Hm.

649
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,380
I can't let this guy

650
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,740
steal Grand Master's feelings.

651
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,180
What should I do?

652
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,740
But how can I enjoy

653
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,620
such a life?

654
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,900
Let's go somewhere else.

655
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,340
Where?

656
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,860
A place that's more fun than flying in the air?

657
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:10,980
It's fun.

658
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:12,780
You'll know when you get there.

659
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,380
Although it's good to turn me into an animal,

660
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,060
it's for protecting me.

661
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:19,700
Silly horse,

662
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,700
you haven't been killed yet.

663
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,300
Oh?

664
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,060
What?

665
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,460
What's wrong with these puppets?

666
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,500
Did they had a fight?

667
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,860
They're the eyes

668
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,860
of the old thing in Shi Qian Lü.

669
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,180
You look so calm.

670
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,460
You know what's going on right away?

671
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,540
I'll find someregistration place

672
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,660
that Shi Qian Lü has.

673
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:53,660
How can we let her relax and be alert?

674
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,660
How long will we be gone?

675
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,660
Will we be discovered?

676
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:02,660
Let them be too bold to break into Bai Lu Ya again.

677
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:06,660
Grand Master, I'm stupid.

678
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,660
I'm not as fun as Ting Yan.

679
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,660
Don't listen to that dead person.

680
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:14,660
Have you found the person who spread the news about Ting Yan?

681
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,660
I have.

682
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,660
It was the previous secret candidate of the Three Holy Mountains.

683
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,660
He had a grudge against Ting Yan.

684
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:25,660
He must have spread the news to take revenge on Ting Yan.

685
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,660
But he's already dead.

686
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,660
I can't find out anything.

687
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,660
Si Mao Jiao,

688
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:36,660
how much longer can you keep going?

689
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:47,660
Is Chiyan City the outskirts of the Palace of Eternal Purity that you mentioned?

690
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,660
That's right.

691
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:52,660
That's where the families of all the major clans live.

692
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:55,660
They're all places of spiritual cultivation.

693
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:59,660
The outskirts are where the small clans of the rich and the poor are gathered.

694
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:02,660
They're all the clans of the disciples of the late Emperor Geng Chen.

695
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,660
They were born and raised in the mortal world.

696
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:08,660
There are also some ordinary people who came here to seek shelter.

697
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:12,660
That's why everyone's cultivation level is very low here.

698
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,660
So that's how it is.

699
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,660
Good!

700
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,660
Good!

701
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,660
Good!

702
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,660
Good!

703
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,660
You really have a good taste.

704
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,660
Good!

705
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:50,660
It's been a long time since I've seen such a thing.

706
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:53,660
Have you ever lived in such a place before?

707
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:57,660
Kind of. I feel a little bit familiar.

708
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,660
We're going to work here.

709
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:02,660
If you like it, you can eat here.

710
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,660
Okay!

711
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,660
I'm talking to her.

712
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:17,660
Grand Master is so nice to new people.

713
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:27,660
Why did I just feel something in my body?

714
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,660
What is she pointing at me for?

715
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,660
I'm sorry.

716
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,660
I'm sorry.

717
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,660
I'm sorry.

718
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,660
I'm sorry.

719
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,660
I'm sorry.

720
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,660
I'm sorry.

721
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,660
I'm sorry.

722
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,660
I'm sorry.

723
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,660
I'm sorry.

724
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,660
I'm sorry.

725
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,660
I'm sorry.

726
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,660
I'm sorry.

727
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,660
I'm sorry.

728
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,660
I'm sorry.

729
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,660
I'm sorry.

730
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:06,660
I'm sorry.

731
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,660
I'm sorry.

732
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,660
I'm sorry.

733
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,660
I'm sorry.

734
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,660
I'm sorry.

735
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,660
I'm sorry.

736
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,660
I'm sorry.

737
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,660
I'm sorry.

738
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,660
