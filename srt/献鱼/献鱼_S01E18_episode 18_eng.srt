1
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,700
 ♫ Heavens strike with thunderous wrath ♫ 

2
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,420
 ♫ Mountains and rivers shatter before my eyes ♫ 

3
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,780
 ♫ Endless splendor
cultivated through lifetimes ♫ 

4
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,540
 ♫ Turns to dust between my fingers
in an instant ♫ 

5
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,220
 ♫ When the line
between good and evil is clear ♫ 

6
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,340
 ♫ Countless souls drift
into the boundless wilds ♫ 

7
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,500
 ♫ Carrying the spirit fire forward ♫ 

8
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,580
 ♫ I defy fate ♫ 

9
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,980
 ♫ Just to remain by your side ♫ 

10
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,820
 ♫ Falling into love's abyss ♫ 

11
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,860
 ♫ Like heavy rain pouring down ♫ 

12
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,460
 ♫ Drunk on romance ♫ 

13
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,340
 ♫ In a blink, love and hate
vanish into illusion ♫ 

14
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,300
 ♫ Falling into endless love ♫ 

15
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,620
 ♫ Stirring waves upending a lifetime ♫ 

16
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,740
 ♫ Even if this life leads to ruin ♫ 

17
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,980
 ♫ I still choose to be entangled with you ♫ 

18
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,125
 ♫ Through all lifetimes ♫ 

19
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:36,580
 

20
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,518
 

21
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,720
Sect Master Shi, all the damaged sites
on the spiritual peak

22
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,160
show traces of Sima Jiao's spiritual power
and the Spirit Fire.

23
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,440
It seems his target is still you.

24
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,720
I never thought

25
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,520
Sima Jiao would be so arrogant,
even with grave wounds.

26
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,320
If this continues,
I'm afraid the other spiritual peaks

27
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,200
would wind up like Baifeng Mountain.

28
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,960
Come.

29
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,480
At your service, Sect Master Shi.

30
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,830
Summon a dozen elite disciples

31
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,760
to strengthen the defenses on Wufeng Mountain.

32
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,800
Don't allow anyone to set foot there again.

33
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,100
Yes, Sect Master Shi.

34
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:34,240
Master Yuan, Wufeng Mountain holds something

35
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,710
that's of great importance to the Shi family.

36
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:39,990
Go with them and guard it well.

37
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,830
Report back at once if anything happens.

38
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,210
Yes.

39
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,390
Father, the Spirit Fire
isn't on Wufeng Mountain.

40
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:58,690
Is this a trap to catch them?

41
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,360
Yuan Che clearly has something up his sleeve.

42
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,820
We'll play along.

43
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,640
We shall use Yuan Che as bait

44
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,390
to draw Sima Jiao to Wufeng Mountain.

45
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,360
I'll lead some disciples
to set an ambush there.

46
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,640
All right.

47
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,960
By the way, Father,

48
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,550
the Spirit Fire is hidden on Taiwei Mountain.

49
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,990
It must also be guarded.

50
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,640
I'll take my men to protect it from behind.

51
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,240
You ought to conceal yourselves well

52
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,270
and hold the defense of Taiwei Mountain.

53
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:34,150
Once we capture Sima Jiao and obtain his blood,

54
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,870
we can then find a chance

55
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,990
to merge with the new Spirit Fire.

56
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,550
Sect Master Shi, Madam Ye is here.

57
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,800
Let her in.

58
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,240
Yes.

59
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,710
Go prepare first.

60
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,980
Yes.

61
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,740
Madam Ye.

62
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,240
You'll follow me to Wufeng Mountain tomorrow.

63
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,710
That's a perfect chance for you

64
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,990
to take your clan back to the Demon Realm.

65
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:06,240
This time, you'd better
show your utmost sincerity.

66
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,700
Is Sima Jiao at Wufeng Mountain?

67
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:12,320
He set this trap himself.

68
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,420
He will surely come.

69
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,900
Grandmaster, Yuan Che has sent word.

70
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,460
Please follow the spiritual power.

71
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,880
Fish in a barrel.

72
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,780
What fish? Shi Qian Lv?

73
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,960
Don't worry about that.

74
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,640
I want to know.

75
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,900
Tell me, Nian Jiu.

76
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,080
The Shi family's spiritual peaks are vast.

77
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,790
Even if Grandmaster sends out
many puppets to search,

78
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,560
it would consume much time.

79
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,440
So, he has Yuan Che damage the spiritual peaks

80
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,790
with Grandmaster's spiritual power

81
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:57,120
to provoke Shi Qian Lv's suspicion.

82
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,720
That way, Shi Qian Lv will dispatch men

83
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,320
to guard the place
where the Spirit Fire is hidden.

84
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,900
If we follow them,
we can find the new Spirit Fire.

85
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,760
Stay here. I'll be back soon.

86
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,230
No, your wounds aren't healed.

87
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,270
I'll go with you.

88
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,590
I may not help much,

89
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,150
but being with you

90
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,780
is better than worrying here alone.

91
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,780
Just this once.

92
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,050
Let's go.

93
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,560
Master Yuan, all Shi's disciples
are in position.

94
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,560
Good.

95
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,350
Let's head to Wufeng Mountain.

96
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,660
Yes, Master Yuan.

97
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,590
Is everything ready?

98
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:00,690
Sect Master Shi, 300 elite disciples
are gathered to march with you.

99
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,230
Xu, how's it on your side?

100
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,440
All is ready.

101
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,980
I can lead my men
to Taiwei Mountain at any time.

102
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,690
Excellent.

103
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,390
 

104
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,270
Sect Master Shi ordered us to guard this place.

105
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,200
You stay here.

106
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,760
I'll scout the surroundings first.
Once it's clear, I'll regroup with you.

107
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,250
 Yes, Master Yuan. 

108
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,760
Sect Master Shi.

109
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,590
Sect Master Shi, don't forget your promise.

110
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,760
You may kill Sima Jiao,

111
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,080
but you mustn't hurt
Liao Ting Yan or Hei Nian Jiu.

112
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,350
Madam Ye, you're truly a loyal friend.

113
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:58,680
As long as you prove your sincerity,
I'll keep my word.

114
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,790
Sima Jiao will show himself soon.

115
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,520
Once he does, strike him down.

116
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,930
Yes, Sect Master Shi.

117
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,170
I wonder how things are going on Father's side.

118
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,080
Don't worry, Young Master.

119
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,680
Sect Master commands hundreds of disciples,

120
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,030
and most are beyond the Soulshift stage.

121
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,120
And with Sect Master leading the charge,

122
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,000
plus Sima Jiao's injury,
he won't get away so easily.

123
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,780
All we need to do is head to Taiwei Mountain
and secure the Spirit Fire.

124
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,220
Gengchen Celestial Palace will soon
welcome its new master.

125
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,130
Let's go.

126
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:10,150
That old man hid the Spirit Fire
on Taiwei Mountain.

127
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,470
How did you know it wasn't on Wufeng Mountain,

128
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,350
and that they'd split their forces?

129
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:17,930
I had already planted puppets there.

130
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,120
I see.

131
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,030
You can sense the Fengshan bloodline
through puppets.

132
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,200
You knew long ago

133
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,910
the Spirit Fire wasn't on Wufeng Mountain.

134
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,560
And you also foresaw that Shi Qian Lv

135
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,560
would send his men to guard
the new Spirit Fire out of caution.

136
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,590
So, he divided his forces,

137
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,990
one to lure you in,

138
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,510
the other to guard the Spirit Fire.

139
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,590
So, you played along,

140
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,350
had Yuan Che pretend to fall into his trap,

141
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:45,040
and at the same time,
placed a tracking spell on Shi Zhen Xu

142
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,650
to guide us, saving us from searching blindly.

143
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,130
Brilliant.

144
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,870
It seems Yuan Che
wasn't conspiring with Sima Jiao.

145
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:12,490
And Sima Jiao didn't fall for your plan either.

146
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,160
All is ready, Father.

147
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,110
I can lead my men
to Taiwei Mountain at any time.

148
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:22,060
No, it's a trap!

149
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,830
Zhen Xu, Sima Jiao is after you.

150
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,410
Stop! Return at once!

151
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,250
Who's there?

152
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,870
Yuan Shang, you could've lived a few more days,

153
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,160
but you came seeking death.

154
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,630
You villain, I hold no grudge against you,

155
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,510
yet you try to harm me! Shameless!

156
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:11,680
You're nothing but a coward
who colludes with the Demon Race.

157
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,680
I'll kill you. You deserve to die.

158
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,510
You slaughter innocents for your own gain.

159
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,400
Compared to Sima Jiao,

160
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,370
you're the true heartless sinner!

161
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,440
Once I take Gengchen Celestial Palace,

162
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,250
who is sinner and who is saint,

163
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,820
I will decide.

164
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:48,400
Old thing, die!

165
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,740
Shang.

166
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,710
Do you have a death wish, too, Yuan Che?

167
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:07,740
Shi Qian Lv, you don't deserve
to be called human!

168
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:20,940
Let's leave.

169
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,940
Father.

170
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:50,800
I'm useless and always a burden to you.

171
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,610
How could I ever blame you? You're my son.

172
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,710
I made grave mistakes out of greed,

173
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,740
and I've disappointed you.

174
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,280
But all I ever wanted was to be your pride,

175
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,010
not your burden.

176
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:50,180
I, Yuan Shang, am no worthless trash
raised by Four Seasons Palace.

177
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,010
Shang!

178
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:32,980
Get up, all of you!
Come with me to Taiwei Mountain.

179
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,250
It's Father's messenger crane.

180
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,080
Zhen Xu, Si... is after...

181
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,770
Stop! Return... at once!

182
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,610
I can't hear it clearly.

183
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,920
Could something have happened to Father?

184
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,920
What is it, Young Master?

185
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,990
Something has happened to Father.

186
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,590
We must head to Wufeng Mountain now.

187
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,100
- Let's go.
- Yes, Young Master.

188
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,460
Sima Jiao?

189
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,080
Take me to the Spirit Fire.

190
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,490
Over my dead body.

191
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,580
In that case...

192
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:53,160
Sima Jiao, I'll see how long
you can keep that smug face.

193
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,680
Once my father arrives,

194
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,160
you will die for sure.

195
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,250
Gengchen Celestial Palace
belongs to the Shi family.

196
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:08,280
My only regret is that
I can't kill you to avenge Xue.

197
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,320
I will not forgive you, even in death.

198
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,280
What nonsense are you spouting?

199
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,350
An Xue was killed by Shi Qian Lv.

200
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,590
It had nothing to do with Grandmaster.

201
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:21,830
No. That's impossible.

202
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:24,080
This is all Sima Jiao's fault!

203
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,180
This is all your scheme!

204
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:43,110
Your wound just healed,
but you're bleeding again.

205
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,410
It's fine.

206
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,230
You did well just now.

207
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:53,130
Since you're at it, carry on.

208
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,890
Kill him.

209
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,650
I don't think so.

210
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,400
I... I don't want to.

211
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,920
Sima Jiao, you're despicable.

212
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,470
You let this demon wench kill me?

213
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,920
- You think you two can stay together forever?
- You're courting death.

214
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,530
Your love bond will be severed
by the way of heaven!

215
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:25,770
No!

216
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:33,180
No!

217
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,220
Why must you be mad with me?

218
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,990
Even if I told you, you wouldn't understand.

219
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:56,070
No, I don't.

220
00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:00,220
Shi Zhen Xu was meant to kill us,
and he insulted you.

221
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,380
That's why I wanted you to kill him yourself.

222
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,120
I know you were born into a world

223
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,960
where it's kill or be killed.

224
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,200
I understand that.

225
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,330
But I will never kill
unless there's no other way.

226
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,460
Is that so wrong?

227
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,400
Ting Yan.

228
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,700
I don't want to talk to you now.

229
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,790
What do you want then?

230
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:31,740
I've never stopped you
or forced you to do anything.

231
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,220
You can't treat me this way.

232
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,790
For me,

233
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:45,510
there's only "want" or "don't want",

234
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,360
never "can't".

235
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,550
But for me,

236
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:52,220
killing is something I cannot do.

237
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,250
You may dislike killing,

238
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,440
but you must know how.

239
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,420
Otherwise, you'll only be killed.

240
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,940
Whatever the reason,
I don't want to kill anyone.

241
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,420
And right now, I don't want to see you either.

242
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:33,530
Then, when will you want to see me?

243
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,710
Grandmaster.

244
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:09,230
I believe Shi Zhen Xu was heading
toward the Spirit Fire.

245
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:11,510
The puppets you transformed
from Shi family's man earlier today

246
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,470
are already searching for the Spirit Fire

247
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,880
around the spiritual peak.

248
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,710
I'll go there to inspect.

249
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,360
Let me go with you, Grandmaster.

250
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,770
No, stay here and protect her.

251
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,530
Zhen Xu.

252
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:00,850
It is all my fault

253
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,660
that you've suffered this fate.

254
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,960
 

255
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,750
Don't worry.

256
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,530
I'll kill Sima Jiao with my own hands.

257
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,290
I'll avenge you.

258
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,790
Sect Master Shi,
Taiwei Mountain is undisturbed.

259
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:20,290
Sima Jiao hasn't discovered
the Spirit Fire yet.

260
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,530
Fortunately, we acted in time.

261
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,460
But...

262
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,640
My... My son.

263
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,790
But Sima Jiao and his partner are strange.

264
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,490
They're impossible to track.

265
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:48,200
Didn't you already discover

266
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,790
that they once entered my treasury

267
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,440
and the Thunder Valley?

268
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,640
Go.

269
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,750
Follow this trail
and send Ye Ru Ling to investigate.

270
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,400
She found Liao Ting Yan last time.

271
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,160
She will surely find their hideout again.

272
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,400
Go now.

273
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,510
Yes, Sect Master Shi.

274
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,900
Come back.

275
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,660
My patience is wearing thin.

276
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:18,030
Tell her to meet me in the secret chamber.

277
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,420
Yes, Sect Master Shi.

278
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,440
Cang Lan.

279
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,810
Cang Lan.

280
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,400
- Are you all right?
- Ru Ling.

281
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,380
Sect Master Shi,
why are you pressing us so hard?

282
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,900
Madam Ye.

283
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:41,680
You slew the back serpent last time.

284
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,620
Am I right?

285
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,530
But...

286
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:51,850
Why is he still alive?

287
00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:00,360
You'd show mercy to a mere beast,

288
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,880
let alone to Liao Ting Yan.

289
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,660
Tell me, what should I do with you?

290
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,600
Sect Master Shi, release my sister first.

291
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,470
Say what you want me to do.

292
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:18,470
In three days,

293
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,600
capture Liao Ting Yan.

294
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,310
Otherwise,

295
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:24,470
if you fail by a single day,

296
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,380
I'll slaughter a hundred of your clan.

297
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,850
Cang Lan.

298
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,790
Cang Lan.

299
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:36,010
- Sect Master Shi.
- I think I've been too kind to you.

300
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,220
Cang Lan.

301
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,960
Cang Lan.

302
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,200
Three days.

303
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,440
You only have three days.

304
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,620
This is your last chance.

305
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,220
Cang Lan.

306
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,680
Cang Lan, don't be afraid.

307
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,550
I'm here.

308
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,030
I won't let anything happen to you.

309
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,400
Don't be afraid.

310
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,660
I'm not afraid of dying.

311
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,490
I only regret

312
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:16,230
that I can't see our people return home,

313
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:19,380
to see Mother's last wish fulfilled.

314
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,310
Don't say that.

315
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,990
I'm here with you.

316
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,010
I won't let you die.

317
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:35,920
Ru Ling, my single life is nothing

318
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,010
compared to our whole clan.

319
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,350
Ru Ling.

320
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,660
Don't let hatred blind you.

321
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:53,050
Remember what you promised Mother and me.

322
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:59,050
You must bring our people home.

323
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,660
Cang Lan.

324
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,200
Cang Lan.

325
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,490
Cang Lan.

326
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,470
Cang Lan.

327
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,940
I'm sorry.

328
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,290
I'm so sorry.

329
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,330
It's my fault.

330
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,400
I'm sorry.

331
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,440
I'm sorry, Cang Lan.

332
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,250
Cang Lan.

333
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,660
How could this happen?

334
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,220
I know I killed someone. I was wrong.

335
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,250
Must you do this to me?

336
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,750
It was terrifying.

337
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:13,700
Don't make me keep remembering it.

338
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,710
No.

339
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:21,570
I must do something else to distract myself.

340
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,270
 I don't want to kill anyone. 

341
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:33,770
 And right now, I don't want to see you either. 

342
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:38,620
 Then, when will you want to see me again? 

343
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,660
 I can't sense her around here. 

344
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,570
 Did she leave? 

345
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,790
Grandmaster.

346
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,440
Where did she go?

347
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,960
I don't know.

348
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,920
Ting Yan told me not to follow.

349
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,200
She said

350
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,810
she was going to put the silence bugs
caught in Thunder Valley to great use.

351
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:56,070
It smells wonderful,

352
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:58,290
but I don't feel like eating at all.

353
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,550
Sima Jiao, I once read in a travel anecdote

354
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:08,360
that the silence bugs
can attract Soul Flying Fish,

355
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,310
so I secretly collected them,

356
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:13,070
hoping I could catch fish for you.

357
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,980
Let's try them together.

358
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,740
You mustn't do this again.

359
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,440
Do you still want to be angry with me

360
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,380
over something like this?

361
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:52,600
If you were that lofty Grandmaster,

362
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,140
I wouldn't dare be angry at all.

363
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,490
But you're not.

364
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:07,380
You're the one dearest to me in this world.

365
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:21,010
You're right.

366
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:27,010
Our peaceful days together are precious.

367
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,490
I shouldn't have quarreled with you.

368
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,900
You say that as if our good days are over.

369
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,180
Of course not.

370
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:51,680
I didn't sleep well this afternoon.

371
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,050
I'm tired.

372
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,380
You can rest.

373
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:08,250
Ting Yan, seeing you cry,

374
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,330
it was the first time in my life I felt regret.

375
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,990
From now on, I'll never force you to do

376
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:18,010
what's against your will.

377
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:53,840
There's nothing in this world I fear.

378
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,840
But the thought of you
not eating or sleeping well

379
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,810
really scares me.

380
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,050
 Hold him down. 

381
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,530
Don't be afraid.

382
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,400
It's a dream.

383
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,230
No.

384
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:49,490
This is the most frightening thing
I've ever seen.

385
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,090
In my Soul Manor, I've witnessed

386
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:24,140
seas of corpses and blood
and the horrors of hell.

387
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,090
I never knew that one could be so traumatized

388
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,290
just by killing an animal.

389
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:38,180
You can take my fear as a spectacle.

390
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,940
Of course not.

391
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,880
What is this?

392
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:50,460
You can sleep on it,
and you'll have sweet dreams.

393
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,740
That's incredible.

394
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:02,120
The pillow isn't as hard as it looks.

395
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,010
Quite comfortable.

396
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:09,500
I'll enter your Soul Manor
to stay with you tonight.

397
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,330
What is that scent?

398
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:39,210
It smells like sweets.

399
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:47,470
Happy birthday to me!

400
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:50,190
Happy birthday to me!

401
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:53,030
- Happy birthday to me!
- Careful.

402
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:55,760
Happy birthday to me!

403
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,160
Come on. Let's all wish Senior Liao
a happy birthday.

404
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,190
Thank you.

405
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,320
- Here. Happy birthday.
- Come on.

406
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,440
- Come on.
- You all bottoms up, and I'll take a sip.

407
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,660
All right.

408
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:07,550
Come.

409
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:10,070
Ting Yan, let's divide the cake.

410
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,330
Sure.

411
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:15,660
- Bring the plates.
- Get the plates.

412
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:18,320
 ♫ Turns to dust between my fingers
in an instant ♫ 

413
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,620
This is nice.

414
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:24,150
 ♫ When the line
between good and evil is clear ♫ 

415
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,510
Jiao!

416
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:27,940
Come! I saved you some cake.

417
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:31,220
 ♫ Carrying the spirit fire forward ♫ 

418
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:36,540
 ♫ I defy fate just to remain by your side ♫ 

419
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:40,380
 ♫ Falling into love's abyss like heavy rain ♫ 

420
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:45,220
 ♫ Pouring down ♫ 

421
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,760
Good morning, Jiao.

422
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,620
Did you have a nice dream?

423
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,580
Were you happy?

424
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,510
Very happy.

425
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:02,800
I dreamed my master and juniors
celebrated my birthday.

426
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,240
And you, too.

427
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,070
We ate cake together.

428
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:09,660
It reminded me of the days with my family.

429
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:14,020
So, this jade pillow works wonders.

430
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:19,260
It's so useful. Why don't you use it yourself?

431
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:24,240
 ♫ Drunk on romance ♫ 

432
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,590
I have special powers,
and many artifacts and elixirs

433
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:31,320
are useless to me.

434
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,290
This jade pillow is as well.

435
00:36:33,979 --> 00:36:37,659
 ♫ Even if this life leads to ruin ♫ 

436
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:42,470
Luckily, you have me.

437
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:45,800
Once your heart is calmed by this pillow,

438
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,700
you can rest in my Soul Manor again.

439
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:55,970
But why carve a wild boar on it?

440
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,320
A wild boar?

441
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,020
That's a dream tapir.

442
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,220
It eats dreams.

443
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,550
This is the legendary dream tapir?

444
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,470
A mere dream tapir.

445
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:11,320
What's so legendary about it?

446
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,100
I've never seen one before.

447
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:23,740
I'll take you to see it when I return.

448
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,280
Do you have important matters today?

449
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,990
Yes.

450
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:34,700
To pursue my career.

451
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,670
I'll leave Nian Jiu here with you.

452
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,440
No matter what happens,

453
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,850
don't step into the Inner Court.

454
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,370
All right.

455
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,190
Wasn't this Yingluo necklace broken

456
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:04,020
during the thunder tribulation?

457
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,920
How is it even more beautiful now?

458
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,410
I found the Thunderstone Core to reforge it.

459
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:30,580
Not even lightning can damage it now.

460
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:35,240
We just left Thunder Valley,

461
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,140
and you've secretly repaired it.

462
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,540
Impressive.

463
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:46,240
This artifact can withstand all harm.

464
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,590
Even against an expert like Shi Qian Lv,

465
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:51,320
even if you lie still,

466
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,440
it would take half a day of his full strength

467
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,720
to break it.

468
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,660
And after it's broken?

469
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,670
Before that happens,

470
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,550
I'll find you.

471
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:04,880
You must promise me

472
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,290
not to tear open your wounds, stumble, or fall.

473
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:13,370
I'll be worried.

474
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:29,250
No one can harm me.

475
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:32,620
 Hark at him. 

476
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:42,960
I mean, you're the best.

477
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,590
That's not what you really think.

478
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:48,030
My mind is calm now.

479
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:50,500
You can't read my thoughts.

480
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,330
I don't need to read them.

481
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:02,180
I can guess.

482
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,700
Wait for me.

483
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,020
I will.

484
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:06,320
You carry another trace of Sima blood.

485
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,070
It's from the one who feeds the Spirit Fire.

486
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,850
Take me to him.

487
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,400
 The barrier is powerful. 

488
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,770
 Looks like the Spirit Fire is inside. 

489
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,800
 ♫ Autumn winds sigh ♫ 

490
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,720
 ♫ Moon and stars dapple the sky ♫ 

491
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,760
 ♫ Brushing the loneliness of bygone days ♫

 ♫ Candlelight flickers low ♫

 ♫ Shadows sway ♫

 ♫ Shimmering in the night ♫

 ♫ With a brush I draw ♫ 

496
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,760
 ♫ The color of light ♫ 

497
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:52,760
 ♫ To warm your frozen soul ♫ 

498

 ♫ Yet cannot be touched ♫ 

501
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,680
 ♫ Following ♫ 

502
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,080
 ♫ The veins of gravel ♫ 

503
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:08,800
 ♫ I turn into spirit fire ♫ 

504
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,680
 ♫ Burning away ♫ 

505
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:16,760
 ♫ All these karmic ties ♫ 

506
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,960
 ♫ To save you ♫ 

507
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,000
 ♫ To save me ♫ 

508
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,880
 ♫ To cross over all suffering,
I'll break through ♫ 

509
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,120
 ♫ The laws of heaven ♫ 

510
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,920
 ♫ The vortex of reincarnation ♫ 

511
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:33,080
 ♫ What of life and death? ♫ 

512
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,880
 ♫ To save you ♫ 

513
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,840
 ♫ To save me ♫ 

514
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:40,720
 ♫ To redeem all beings, I'll let pass ♫ 

515
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,760
 ♫ Right and wrong ♫ 

516
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,840
 ♫ Rumors and tales ♫ 

517
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:48,760
 ♫ To seize fate ♫ 

518
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,160
 ♫ With my own hands ♫ 

519
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,960
 ♫ For you ♫ 

520
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,120
 ♫ For me ♫ 

521
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:00,680
 ♫ For the healing of wounds ♫ 

522
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,800
 ♫ I'll stir the murky seas ♫ 

523
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,120
 ♫ And strive against the heavens ♫ 

524
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,680
 ♫ To protect the vastness ♫ 

525
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,760
 ♫ For you ♫ 

526
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,640
 ♫ For me ♫ 

527
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,480
 ♫ For the light of dawn ♫ 

528
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,560
 ♫ I'll face promises ♫ 

529
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,840
 ♫ Like a moth to a flame ♫ 

530
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:28,000
 ♫ And use my body to shine ♫ 

531
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,640
 ♫ On even more ♫
