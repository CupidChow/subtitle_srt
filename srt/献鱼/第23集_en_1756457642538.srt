1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm here to save you.

2
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm here to save you.

3
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm here to save you.

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm here to save you.

5
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm here to save you.

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm here to save you.

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm here to save you.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm here to save you.

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm here to save you.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm here to save you.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm here to save you.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm here to save you.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm here to save you.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm here to save you.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm here to save you.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm here to save you.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm here to save you.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm here to save you.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm here to save you.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm here to save you.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm here to save you.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm here to save you.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm here to save you.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm here to save you.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I still want to be with you

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
for a lifetime.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Grand teacher,

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Grand teacher, are you all right?

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Is there something wrong

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
with your soul and body?

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,820
You were right.

32
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,400
Wonderful!

33
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,380
Did you find Shi Qianli?

34
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,960
He ran away.

35
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,360
Then what did you do here?

36
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,100
on 마무� pr

37
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,100
Junior Sister,

38
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,100
the soul-seeker is the girl they killed.

39
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,100
She went to the Demon Citadel today.

40
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,100
Grand Master,

41
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,100
do you know?

42
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,100
The people at the rouge station said

43
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,100
they found her in the Yangtze River.

44
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,100
They also told me

45
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,100
that she had

46
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,100
the long-sleeved shirt I gave her.

47
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,100
Grand Master,

48
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,100
Grand Master,

49
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,100
I finally got her news.

50
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,100
Now I lost her immediately.

51
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,100
Am I...

52
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,100
Am I never going to see her again?

53
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,100
The rouge has been reborn.

54
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,100
You are still the one who protected it.

55
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,100
Really?

56
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,100
When I protected the soul-seeker,

57
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,100
I only found a bunch of ashes.

58
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,100
I didn't know

59
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,100
that it was her.

60
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,100
But,

61
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,100
I advise you not to be too happy.

62
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,100
When I was doing the soul-seeker for her,

63
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,100
I found her soul

64
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,100
was damaged and disabled.

65
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,100
I'm afraid that the part of memory that belongs to the Night-Ring Bell

66
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,100
is hard to find.

67
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,100
You mean

68
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,100
by then,

69
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,100
she might not remember me, right?

70
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,100
She will still remember your heart.

71
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,100
She will treat you like a child.

72
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,100
She will make you feel sorry.

73
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,100
Although everything that Grand Master said

74
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,100
hasn't happened yet,

75
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,100
what you said

76
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,100
really made my heart hurt.

77
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,100
As long as she is still alive,

78
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,100
no matter how painful your heart is,

79
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,100
you have to be patient.

80
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,100
Grand Master said that

81
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,100
as long as she is still alive,

82
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,100
that is the most important thing.

83
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,100
Hurry up.

84
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,100
Follow up.

85
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,100
Hurry up.

86
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,100
Hurry up.

87
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,100
Hurry up.

88
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,100
Hurry up.

89
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,100
Brother,

90
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,100
there were people chasing after the evil jade.

91
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,100
Then there were four horses chasing after the sand.

92
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,100
If Liao Ting Yan didn't do anything,

93
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,100
would we just sit and wait?

94
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,100
Move away from that group of ghost masters.

95
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,100
Greetings, Grand Master.

96
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,100
Check the situation.

97
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,100
Who is in the carriage?

98
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,100
Brother.

99
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,100
Let's go.

100
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,100
Yes.

101
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,100
This person used to be the head of the Xian Mansion.

102
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,100
He is also a bit of a talent.

103
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,100
Now he is a son.

104
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,100
It's really funny.

105
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,100
Grand Master,

106
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,100
why did you let him go?

107
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,100
I heard that Liao Ting Yan has been

108
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,100
a thief for 18 years.

109
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,100
I always thought that

110
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,100
Shi Qian Lv was his savior.

111
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,100
He also knows Liao Ting Yan the best

112
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,100
in the Xian Mansion.

113
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,100
He left him a name.

114
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,100
I just don't know

115
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,100
if he will accept the invitation.

116
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,100
Why does he need to accept the invitation?

117
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,100
When he is in a poor situation,

118
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,100
he will naturally let go of his status.

119
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,100
Keep an eye on his movements.

120
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,100
Yes.

121
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,100
Fortunately, they didn't see

122
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,100
that we are the people of the Xian Mansion.

123
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,100
We are the people of the Xian Mansion.

124
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,100
We are the people of the Xian Mansion.

125
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,100
We are the people of the Xian Mansion.

126
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,100
We are the people of the Xian Mansion.

127
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,100
He is the fruit of the devil's jade.

128
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,100
Because his cultivation

129
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,100
is not so much as to see

130
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,100
our identities.

131
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,100
Then why did they

132
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,100
let us leave?

133
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,100
Maybe they have a purpose.

134
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,100
Hey, hey, hey.

135
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,100
That man.

136
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,100
Stop.

137
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,100
Why are you still here?

138
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,100
Your grandmaster said

139
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,100
I could stay.

140
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,100
Let me tell you.

141
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,100
That's because our grandmaster

142
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,100
loves Ting Yan very much.

143
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,100
That's why you can survive.

144
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,100
You have to work harder.

145
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,100
How dare you still

146
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,100
make such a big fuss?

147
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,100
I'm telling you.

148
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,100
From now on,

149
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,100
you are not allowed to appear

150
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,100
in front of Ting Yan.

151
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,100
Sure.

152
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,100
But Yan

153
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,100
loves to eat my food.

154
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,100
If he can't eat it,

155
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,100
he will be bored and unhappy.

156
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,100
He can't sleep.

157
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,100
If he hurts his body,

158
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,100
who will take responsibility?

159
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,100
You mean

160
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,100
he can't do anything but you?

161
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,100
It seems that

162
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,100
he can.

163
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,100
You are too dangerous

164
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,100
to him.

165
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,100
I will be with him

166
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,100
to protect you.

167
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,100
He and I are already a couple.

168
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,100
You are just

169
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,100
a little clown.

170
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,100
But

171
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,100
it smells

172
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,100
very good.

173
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,100
What?

174
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,100
It's just a small trick.

175
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,100
We can't get what Ting Yan

176
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,100
wants to eat.

177
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,100
Grandmaster.

178
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,100
Even if you don't kill that guy,

179
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,100
you can't make him so arrogant.

180
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,100
A little clown

181
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,100
deserves to be angry with me.

182
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,100
I don't need to be like him.

183
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,100
Grandmaster.

184
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,100
You don't look

185
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,100
angry at all.

186
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,100
Let's go.

187
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,100
Your magic is getting better.

188
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,100
You are practicing secretly.

189
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,100
I don't have it.

190
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,100
Stop it.

191
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,100
I know you love to improve your martial arts.

192
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,100
Again.

193
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,100
Who?

194
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,100
I am forced to do it.

195
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,100
What?

196
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,100
Nothing.

197
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,100
Come on.

198
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,100
It's dark.

199
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,100
You should go back and have a rest.

200
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,100
I will go outside

201
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,100
to check if there is a place

202
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,100
to guard against the sun.

203
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,100
Prepare for our departure

204
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,100
in the future.

205
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,100
Okay.

206
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,100
Okay.

207
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,100
Why doesn't Feng Qi listen to me?

208
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,100
He doesn't want to leave.

209
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,100
He always

210
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,100
looks for me to practice martial arts.

211
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,100
I practice martial arts to protect myself.

212
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,100
I don't like it.

213
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,100
After the matter with Ming Hen

214
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,100
has charged Director.

215
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,100
I will go back with you

216
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,100
to meet Zheng Qian Glückussia.

217
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,100
Yes.

218
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:54,940
​​​ ​ 양 treasure, my favorite thing. And my father's love."​ ​​

219
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,700
​​​ ​When did you get here?​ ​​

220
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,740
​​​ ​I'll take you to a place.​ ​​

221
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,740
I can't refuse his request.

222
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,740
Why do I feel like I've been here before?

223
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,740
You remember now?

224
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,740
No.

225
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:25,740
It's just that the feeling of being in a dream feels like I've seen it before.

226
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,740
That's not a dream.

227
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,740
This is where we first met.

228
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,740
I'm so tired.

229
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,740
You can't walk anymore?

230
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,740
Grand Teacher, I'm just asking.

231
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,740
We're so high up. What are we going to do?

232
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,740
Do nothing.

233
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,740
When you climbed up the tower, you almost sat down on the stairs.

234
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,740
I've never met anyone weaker than you.

235
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:18,740
Even the snakes I raised are a hundred times stronger than you.

236
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:22,740
Don't let the clouds leave the river.

237
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,740
In the memories, half of the waves are red.

238
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:31,740
Now that you're climbing up the stairs, you won't be so tired.

239
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:38,780
My cultivation of the

240
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,740
I know

241
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:46,740
even if I'm not tired, you don't like it.

242
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:52,740
I will meet you on that day.

243
00:14:52,740 --> 00:15:00,740
Love is too crazy to open up a new love.

244
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,740
Mom!

245
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,740
Mom!

246
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,300
I...

247
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,180
Snow has not stopped, night has not stopped,

248
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,060
the three lives are waiting for the quietness.

249
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,900
You've always loved exquisite things.

250
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,700
These lamps...

251
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,580
I moved them to the good sky.

252
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,060
Do you like them?

253
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,180
The things I bathed are all practical.

254
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,020
I've rarely seen such a beautiful thing.

255
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,460
If you like it,

256
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,580
I'll light these lamps for you every day.

257
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,740
So beautiful.

258
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,420
The lanterns look like stars.

259
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,620
Do you like to see stars?

260
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,700
So beautiful.

261
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,020
I haven't seen a shooting star for a long time.

262
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,860
This tower is really suitable for viewing.

263
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:45,980
This tower...

264
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,780
I moved the original Sansheng Mountain here.

265
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,660
It seems that you like this tower very much.

266
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,700
It's a firework.

267
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,220
It's been begging me for five hundred years.

268
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,300
Five hundred years?

269
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,460
Then why did you move it here?

270
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,140
You and I used to live here.

271
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,900
There's your scent here.

272
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,900
I almost forgot that I'm just a substitute.

273
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,460
What he did is not for me.

274
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,020
I'm sorry.

275
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,020
I'm sorry.

276
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,140
I'm sorry.

277
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,620
I'm going to kill you!

278
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,620
What does it have to do with me if your woman dies?

279
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,380
It's my power,

280
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,180
but it's not mine to kill.

281
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,580
You're the one who's stupid to blame others.

282
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,580
But you accidentally burned her to death.

283
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:16,180
You know it's my fault.

284
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,820
If you don't hurt, I'll hurt.

285
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,340
Big pig, you bastard!

286
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,020
You're so stupid.

287
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,020
You're so stupid.

288
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,220
You're so stupid.

289
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,420
You're so stupid.

290
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,540
You're so stupid.

291
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,540
You're so stupid.

292
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,540
You're so stupid.

293
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,860
Why does the word of fire-mouse scolding people

294
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,860
sound a bit like me?

295
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,260
Shut up.

296
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,620
You found this woman back?

297
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,700
I told you to come and water her.

298
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,380
See her bloom blood lilies.

299
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,620
You told her to talk nonsense.

300
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,620
You're a bad woman.

301
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,420
How did you know the truth?

302
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,540
Compared to your evil power

303
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,620
that only knows to burn stars,

304
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,500
I'm sure I have to bow to

305
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,940
my ancestors.

306
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,980
So this is the famous blood lily.

307
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,940
I taught it.

308
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,820
Why does the sugar chair

309
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,540
sound like me?

310
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,660
Young wie!

311
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,580
I was其一.

312
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:52,420
Everyone,

313
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,380
you're such a hero.

314
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,660
Such an angel?

315
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,500
I'm not good at it.

316
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,500
I'm not good at it.

317
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,500
But these years,

318
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,500
I don't have time to

319
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,500
play with the mask.

320
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,500
What's the use of it?

321
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,500
Keep your skin moist.

322
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,500
When I lost you,

323
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,500
I climbed over it alone.

324
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,500
I felt like

325
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,500
in the past ten years,

326
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,500
I was a little bit more

327
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,500
than Qiu Zi

328
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,500
in the Three Holy Mountains.

329
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,500
Wake up.

330
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,500
What he did

331
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,500
was not for you.

332
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,500
Between us,

333
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,500
there were many memories.

334
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,500
They all

335
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,500
were not for you.

336
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,500
They won't change.

337
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,500
They won't fade.

338
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,500
Actually, I'm not

339
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,500
the Liao Ting Yan you mentioned.

340
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,500
We both died together.

341
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,500
How could I admit my mistake?

342
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,500
None of these matters.

343
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,500
You can take today

344
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,500
as our first encounter.

345
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,500
From now on,

346
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,500
I will recreate

347
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,500
the memories of us

348
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,500
in this moment.

349
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,500
Are you willing to

350
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,500
take the first encounter?

351
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,500
Then our first encounter

352
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,500
with the lantern and the stars

353
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,500
is quite romantic.

354
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,500
The more the wound,

355
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,500
the better the treatment.

356
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,500
Why is it so hard

357
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,500
to heal when you're here?

358
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,500
The more you get,

359
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,500
the more you pay.

360
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,500
The world is full of everything.

361
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,500
The more you get,

362
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,500
the more you pay.

363
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,500
The world is full of everything.

364
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,500
The more you get,

365
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,500
the more you pay.

366
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,500
Okay?

367
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,500
I wanted to take it as a first encounter.

368
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,500
The world is full of everything.

369
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,500
Like the rain, it's like a sword in the sky.

370
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,500
The wind and the moon are the same.

371
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,500
Grand Master,

372
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,500
the butterfly sword

373
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,500
I specifically made,

374
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,500
isn't it cute?

375
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,500
The world is full of everything.

376
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,500
The heat and the cold are the only things that matter.

377
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,500
Even if this life is endless,

378
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,500
I still want to be with you.

379
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,500
The world is full of everything.

380
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,500
Have you found anything about the Shixian Lü?

381
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,500
Report, City Leader.

382
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,500
A brother ship has been sailing to the city

383
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,500
and he saw the Shixian Lü.

384
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,500
Unfortunately, when we were chasing after him,

385
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,500
we only saw this car.

386
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,500
It's really the Shixian Lü.

387
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,500
Over there.

388
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,500
Chase them.

389
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,500
Yes.

390
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,500
Let's go.

391
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,500
Brother.

392
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,500
Brother.

393
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,500
How is it?

394
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,500
They're here.

395
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,500
What should we do?

396
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,500
So fast.

397
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,500
Run.

398
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,500
Brother.

399
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,500
Your leg.

400
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,500
Run.

401
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,500
Brother.

402
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,500
Brother.

403
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,500
Your leg.

404
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,500
Run.

405
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,500
Shixian Lü.

406
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,500
You can't escape now.

407
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,500
Because you have a leg, right?

408
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,500
Now it seems that you are lying to Ting Yan.

409
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,500
What nonsense are you talking about?

410
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,500
Brother.

411
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,500
You go.

412
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,500
You guys continue to chase after them.

413
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,500
I'll take this person back to see the Grand Master.

414
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,500
Yes.

415
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,500
I fell asleep again.

416
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,500
If you like it,

417
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,500
I'll light these lanterns for you every day.

418
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,500
Why is my face burning?

419
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,500
I won't really like the silk horse glue, right?

420
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,500
A Yan.

421
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,500
Can I come in?

422
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,500
Come in.

423
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,500
Thank you.

424
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,500
I saw it.

425
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,500
You said that the silk horse glue is really funny.

426
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,500
I wanted to buy you with these tricks.

427
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,500
You really underestimated my eyes.

428
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,500
Actually,

429
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,500
he is really good to me.

430
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,500
He is good to you because he is good to his past lover.

431
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,500
It has nothing to do with you.

432
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,500
Did you forget what you said?

433
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,500
Those lanterns and this tower

434
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,500
have nothing to do with you now.

435
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,500
Don't make a fool of yourself.

436
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,500
Don't say it.

437
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,500
I know.

438
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,500
I feel like a third party now.

439
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,500
His sincerity is not for me.

440
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,500
A Yan.

441
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,500
A Yan.

442
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,500
Actually, we...

443
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,500
I'll take you to meet someone.

444
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,500
Aunt.

445
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,500
Don't call me that.

446
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,500
Our Shi family

447
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,500
doesn't have a traitor like you.

448
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,500
In front of me,

449
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,500
you still dare to talk nonsense.

450
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,500
Let's talk it over.

451
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,500
Let her go first, okay?

452
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,500
I want to take you to see the truth.

453
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,500
See how the Shi family deceived you.

454
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,500
You little girl.

455
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,500
You killed your own brother.

456
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,500
Now,

457
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,500
you still want to see me die for you?

458
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,500
You still don't do it.

459
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,500
Kill her.

460
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,500
I can see the truth.

461
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,500
But can you promise me

462
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,500
not to hurt her no matter what?

463
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,500
Okay.

464
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,500
I promise you.

465
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,500
I'll do it.

466
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,500
The truth doesn't matter.

467
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,500
You can say that.

468
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,500
I'll kill you.

469
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,500
I'll kill you.

470
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,500
I'll kill you.

471
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,500
You won't do it.

472
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,500
I'll kill you.

473
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,500
Okay?

474
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,500
I'll kill you.

475
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,500
I'll kill you.

476
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,500
I'll kill you.

477
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,500
I'll kill you.

478
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,500
I'll kill you.

479
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,500
Help!

480
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,860
How did this happen?

481
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:52,700
Sister.

482
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,700
Brother.

483
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,900
Come.

484
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,100
Come.

485
00:30:59,100 --> 00:30:59,700
Come.

486
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,700
Come with me.

487
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,300
But father...

488
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,500
Don't worry about father.

489
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,100
Come with me.

490
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:05,900
Hurry up.

491
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:06,700
Leave the sedan chair to me.

492
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,700
Hurry up.

493
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,900
Xiong Cheng!

494
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,300
Leave me alone.

495
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:19,900
Hurry up.

496
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,100
Sister killed Sima Qiang

497
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,300
and our family.

498
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,700
Xiong Cheng!

499
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,500
Ting Yi.

500
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,100
Father.

501
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,900
Is this

502
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,100
to cure me?

503
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,500
Father doesn't care about my life.

504
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,900
Someone touched his memory.

505
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,100
But didn't you

506
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,100
ask me to see this?

507
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,100
Aunt.

508
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,700
You promised me

509
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,300
you wouldn't hurt him.

510
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,300
I was searching for the trace of the stone

511
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,900
to protect his soul.

512
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,500
I didn't hurt him.

513
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,500
I'm in a mess now.

514
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,300
Let me think about it.

515
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,100
Ting Yan.

516
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,300
I'm not your Liao Ting Yan.

517
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,900
I don't want to be Liao Ting Yan!

518
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,300
You just need to be yourself.

519
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,300
You don't know who I am.

520
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,100
I know.

521
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,900
You like to stay at home.

522
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,900
You like to play games.

523
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,300
You hate to kill.

524
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,500
You want to die?

525
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:53,900
Ting Yan.

526
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,300
Ting Yan.

527
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,300
Ketu.

528
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,300
I'm sorry.

529
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,300
I didn't expect

530
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,300
I would be

531
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,700
used by you

532
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,700
to make a living.

533
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,700
Brother.

534
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,700
We're at the end of our journey.

535
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,500
I'm willing to fight for our family's revenge.

536
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,900
No.

537
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,700
If you appear before the Sima Sect,

538
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,900
you'll be the last one to die.

539
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,500
I'm willing to die.

540
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,100
I'm willing to die.

541
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,500
If we appear before the Sima Sect,

542
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,900
we'll be the last one to die.

543
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,900
Besides,

544
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,500
we have the chess piece of Liao Ting Yan in our hands.

545
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,100
If Liao Ting Yan wants to fight,

546
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,700
he doesn't need to wait until today.

547
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,700
If I appear before the Sima Sect,

548
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,700
he'll definitely seek for me

549
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,500
and prove himself to Liao Ting Yan.

550
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,300
You'll put the memories we want to show him

551
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,900
into my heart.

552
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,100
I'll do it myself

553
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,700
when Liao Ting Yan read it.

554
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,900
I'll make Liao Ting Yan

555
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,500
hate Sima Sect completely.

556
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,060
But...

557
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,540
Brother, we have no time.

558
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,380
They will catch up with us soon.

559
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:37,060
I bid farewell to you here.

560
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,540
When the Ten Family's revenge is avenged,

561
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:43,820
I hope you can be kind and considerate.

562
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,260
Brother.

563
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,460
I thought I saw you.

564
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,620
But, I'm confused.

565
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,700
I have never seen you again.

566
00:35:59,120 --> 00:35:59,740
I don't know.

567
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,420
It feels like we met for the first time.

568
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,620
Brother, are you ok?

569
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:05,740
Yes, I'm fine.

570
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:06,720
Are you okay?

571
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:13,460
I don't know whether I can be ok.

572
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,260
What happened to you?

573
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,160
Can he leave you alone?

574
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:19,780
Stay away from me.

575
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:20,920
Godfather.

576
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,360
It's nice to meet you.

577
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,360
How comeBu Click cares so much about you?

578
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,740
I...

579
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:35,140
Senior Brother, Senior Sister Ting Yan is fine.

580
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:38,340
But she seemed to have been forced to wash her mouth before.

581
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,940
This caused severe damage to her spiritual body.

582
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:44,540
That's why she fainted when her heart was unstable.

583
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,340
Senior Sister, as your senior sister,

584
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,740
you can try to enter her spiritual body

585
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,940
and personally repair it for her.

586
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,940
She still hasn't accepted me yet.

587
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,140
If I enter her spiritual body without permission,

588
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,140
I will only hurt her.

589
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,540
Use my blood to treat her.

590
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:05,140
Senior Brother, your wound is more difficult to heal than before.

591
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,340
If you directly use blood...

592
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,140
The world is now in a crisis.

593
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,340
If you directly use your blood,

594
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,740
it might cause a counterattack.

595
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,540
You need to make a pill to take.

596
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:19,540
I heard that there are many powerful elixirs masters in the Eastern City.

597
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,940
Maybe I can ask them for help.

598
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,340
I'll learn the elixir masters from you.

599
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,340
Make sure to make the pill.

600
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,940
Make sure to make the pill.

601
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:31,940
But the pill must not be bitter.

602
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,340
Yes.

603
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:44,140
Nian Jiao, have you found the people from the Ten Thousand Towers?

604
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,140
The brothers are all prepared.

605
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,340
We can set out at any time to search for the Ten Thousand Towers.

606
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,540
Set out immediately.

607
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,940
Yes.

608
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,940
Oh, right, Senior Brother.

609
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,540
When we search,

610
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:56,740
we can also take over the Southwest of the Demon Citadel.

611
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:02,940
There is no return to the Southwest.

612
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,940
There is no need to make a meaningless sacrifice.

613
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:11,140
Grand Teacher, you are now starting to care about the life and death of others.

614
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:19,340
Grand Teacher, before I leave, I still have one thing to ask.

615
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:24,940
The day of the rebirth of Hongluo, I will send my heart to you.

616
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,940
Thank you, Grand Teacher.

617
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,340
Where is this?

618
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:12,540
Could this be the legendary spiritual talisman?

619
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:16,540
Yuan Zhu has already died. There shouldn't be a spiritual talisman.

620
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,340
Spiritual talisman?

621
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:23,940
No. This should be my spiritual talisman.

622
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:39,940
Why does this flower look so similar to the blood-red lotus in the Sima Sect?

623
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,740
Liao Qingyan!

624
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,940
Brother!

625
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,140
Brother!

626
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:08,140
He's out.

627
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,940
Ting Yan!

628
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,540
I'm back again.

629
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,140
Hongluo!

630
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,740
Why did you become a child?

631
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,740
I have grown up very fast.

632
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,740
I was only born three or four days ago.

633
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:30,740
If not, I would have gotten all kinds of spiritual talismans since I was born.

634
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:32,740
I am still a little baby now.

635
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:35,940
Why did you call me Ting Yan just now like Sima Jiao?

636
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,940
Did I?

637
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,940
It should be subconscious.

638
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:44,340
After I was born, I often had some strange images in my head.

639
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,740
There were you, me,

640
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:50,940
and even Sima Jiao and that Black Snake City Master.

641
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:54,740
But I completely don't remember that I experienced that.

642
00:40:54,740 --> 00:41:01,140
But I heard that you were the one who asked Sima Jiao to help me get rid of my spirit.

643
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:04,740
What's going on? Aren't you enemies?

644
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,140
That's a long story.

645
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:13,540
That means you and your enemy Sima Jiao have been in love and reunited.

646
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,540
He said that your father was lying to you.

647
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:18,340
Your father also said that Sima Jiao was lying to you.

648
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:22,940
Then, in a conflict between the two sides, Sima Jiao killed your aunt.

649
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:26,940
But I accidentally entered the spirit house and felt that something was wrong.

650
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:29,340
You actually entered the spirit house?

651
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:32,540
I heard that there are old pieces of memory in the spirit house.

652
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,140
What did you see?

653
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:40,140
I saw that the person who killed my brother wasn't Sima Jiao.

654
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,340
It was me.

655
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:48,540
What? Why would there be such memories in your spirit house?

656
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:51,940
Could it be that it's really like what Sima Jiao said?

657
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:56,540
You are just lying to me. You just lost this memory.

658
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:59,340
This is what I'm confused about right now.

659
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:02,340
If what I saw in the spirit house is true,

660
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:05,340
that means that my aunt's memory is fake.

661
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:09,340
Moreover, if Sima Jiao has a ghost in her heart,

662
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,940
she wouldn't insist on taking me to see my aunt's soul.

663
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:17,140
So, you suspect that your father has been lying to you?

664
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,340
Starry Night

665
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,740
Door to Heaven

666
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,140
Ling Er

667
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:06,100
The candlelight is weak, the shadow is shattering

668
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:10,100
Shimmering in the dark night

669
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:14,340
The color of light is enough

670
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:18,340
Warm your cold soul

671
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:22,340
Memories stop, yearning is clear

672
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:25,840
But I can't touch it

673
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:30,340
The sand is covered with the dew

674
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:34,340
The flower is still in full bloom

675
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:40,340
It's all over the world

676
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:46,340
If you're alone

677
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:50,340
You'll have to go through all the hardships

678
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:54,340
The rules of heaven are all about the whirlwind

679
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:58,340
Life and death are the same

680
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:02,340
If you're alone

681
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:06,340
You'll have to go through all the hardships

682
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:10,340
Right and wrong, rumors spread

683
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:16,340
Life and death are the same

684
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:22,340
For you, for me

685
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:26,340
For the peace in the world

686
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:30,340
The sea is warm, the rain is heavy

687
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:34,340
It's all about me

688
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:38,340
For you, for me

689
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:42,340
For the voice of sincerity

690
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:46,340
Facing the promise, it seems like it's not me

691
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:52,340
Light up with my body

692
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:57,340
More
