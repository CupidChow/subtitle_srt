Episode 23

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm willing to raise the fire of the spiritual mountain.

6
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Oh, don't cry.

7
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
E'er, give our child a name.

8
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Then call him Jiao'er.

9
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This baby is the Grandmaster?

10
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Then these two people are the Grandmaster's mother and father?

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What happened?

12
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's useless.

13
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
They are clearly trying to trap our Sima clan.

14
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
My Grandmother has passed away.

15
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
We need to leave the mountain to settle down.

16
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You sealed the White Deer Cliff.

17
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What does this mean?

18
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Later,

19
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
we will send someone to take the Grandmother away from the mountain to settle down.

20
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The Sima clan should be deliberately guarding the spiritual mountain.

21
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Please send someone to protect the spirit mountain.

22
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I will go to the mountain to protect the spirit mountain.

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Please protect the spirit mountain.

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Please settle down in the White Deer Cliff.

25
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The Eight Great Gong Army is so open-minded.

26
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What's the difference between this and treating us as prisoners?

27
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Do you still have our grandmasters in your eyes?

28
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The formation is sealed by the Eight Great Gong Alliance.

29
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It can only be entered and out.

30
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Please don't try to break the formation.

31
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
From the previous generation of grandmasters,

32
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
can't we escape the fate of the Eight Great Gong Alliance?

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Grandmaster.

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Your Highness.

35
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Didn't you escort Grandmother's body to the outside of the formation?

36
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Why did you come back so soon?

37
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yesterday,

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
the Eight Great Gong Princess opened the gap of the formation

39
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
and asked me to send Grandmother's body to the outside of the formation.

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But...

41
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Say it.

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But...

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Those people from the Eight Great Gong

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
actually gave Grandmother's body to the one who wanted to have a feast.

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That's a beast!

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Is Grandmaster's father crazy?

47
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Did he destroy the White Deer Cliff?

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What's going on?

49
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What are you doing?

50
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What are you doing?

51
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What are you doing?

52
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Let's go.

53
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What are you doing?

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What are you doing?

55
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Grandmaster.

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
What are you doing?

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
He's dead.

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Now, only Sima's son who has been abused

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
can serve the spirit fire.

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
This...

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
We can't let them die too.

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
No!

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Now, we have to let Jiao'er meet the spirit fire as soon as possible.

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Then, the people from the Eight Great Gong

65
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
won't dare to hurt her.

66
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
If we can't do anything about the spirit fire,

67
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
she will live forever

68
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
in the pain of burning the spirit fire.

69
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I don't want her to have such a life.

70
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Why don't we end

71
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
the tragedy of the Fengshan Clan?

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Luo'er,

73
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
this is the mission of Jiao'er's birth.

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I don't want you to be in such a situation.

75
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Luo'er,

76
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
this is the mission of Jiao'er's birth.

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
She has the blood of the Fengshan clan.

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
She is pure and strong.

79
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
She is the hope of our Sima Clan.

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Do you know the price of burning the spirit fire?

81
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
If it fails,

82
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
both of you will die.

83
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Sima clan will be destroyed.

84
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I have no choice.

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Today, I am blessed with flesh and spirit bones.

86
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Are you willing to

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
give me Jiao'er?

88
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What I don't want

89
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
is your life.

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Forget it.

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I will depend on you.

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,000
The world is in my hands.

93
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I will live in the past without regret.

94
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I will be brave and brave.

95
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I will break through all the barriers.

96
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I will be brave and brave.

97
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I will be brave and brave.

98
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I will be brave and brave.

99
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I will be brave and brave.

100
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I will be brave and brave.

101
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
From now on,

102
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
you are the world's

103
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
only Sima bloodline.

104
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Sima bloodline

105
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Just burried?

106
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Who buried me?

107
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Institute post,

108
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Lee brother Ma Gang asked us to help.

109
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,680
Look.

110
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,960
You're scared to death.

111
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,680
Why did you put me in the coffin?

112
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,160
You chose a poisonous flower yourself.

113
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,080
I saw you were in a coma for three days.

114
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,480
You were helpless.

115
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,480
I was going to give you a funeral.

116
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,680
All right.

117
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,360
I just wanted to scare you.

118
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,880
I've already detoxified the poison.

119
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,200
I chose a flower with poison.

120
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,320
Didn't you say

121
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,320
only the evil people can detoxify the poison?

122
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,960
But Si Ma E...

123
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,400
Si Ma Jiao's mother

124
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,480
looks so kind.

125
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,880
How can a person

126
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,760
be black and white?

127
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,040
Can a flower

128
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,240
detoxify the poison?

129
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,840
Why is the flower poisonous?

130
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,640
Before death,

131
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,120
my mood was calm.

132
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,920
The ancient pearl was a flower.

133
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,800
Before death, the pain was hateful.

134
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,360
It detoxified the poison.

135
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,840
No wonder.

136
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,760
Listen to your tone.

137
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,240
You saw who was in the whole body of the flower.

138
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,560
He didn't know

139
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,240
the poison I took off

140
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,560
was the flower that his mother grew.

141
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,320
Should I tell him?

142
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,040
Forget it.

143
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,920
He's in a good mood now.

144
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,360
I'd better not take him to the bar.

145
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,280
I didn't expect

146
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,000
the family of the deceased

147
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,280
had been in a joint attack by the eight great masters.

148
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,480
They all had their own

149
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,920
hatred for the fire.

150
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,880
No wonder he wanted to fight against them.

151
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,720
But the flower

152
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,080
is not incurable.

153
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,040
Why did I come back alive?

154
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,520
Didn't you say the flower was detoxifying the poison?

155
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,680
It's not the flower that was in the pot.

156
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,840
It's the flower that was in the pot.

157
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,480
How did you identify the poison?

158
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,520
I'm from the Sima clan.

159
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,720
The poison is not natural to me.

160
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,360
Besides, the fire can help me distinguish the poison.

161
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,320
Did you call for fire

162
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,080
to save me in such a big battle?

163
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,920
You need fire?

164
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,960
I just need to distinguish between sweet and bitter.

165
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,080
Poison again.

166
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,680
Boss, will you make me some Shennong Shi?

167
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,760
I'll eat the white grass if I'm tired.

168
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,040
As long as I want to kill you,

169
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,960
you'll die no matter where you are.

170
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,720
If I don't want to kill you,

171
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,720
even if you die,

172
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,840
I can still bring you back to life.

173
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,280
What a dead man!

174
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,400
By the way, Boss,

175
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,080
I've been in a coma for three days.

176
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,040
Has anyone come to see me?

177
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,680
Who do you want to see?

178
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,160
It seems that there's no one.

179
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,400
It's the same as getting off the plane.

180
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,360
There's no difference.

181
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,000
What?

182
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,040
Nothing.

183
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,400
Master,

184
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:49,960
look.

185
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,640
Since you're out of the mountain,

186
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,680
it's no use keeping me.

187
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,200
I'm here for nothing.

188
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,120
How about I go back to Qinggutian?

189
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,560
Qinggutian is better than me.

190
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,120
You're going to be angry again

191
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,880
if you say it's better than me.

192
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,480
He just made me a Shennong Shi.

193
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,280
It seems that he thinks I'm his confidant now.

194
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,920
He won't let me pick grass for a while.

195
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,760
If you say it's better than me,

196
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,000
I'll kill you.

197
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,520
It's not better than me.

198
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,080
I'll take a leave.

199
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,680
I want to see Ru Ling.

200
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,360
Lu Yun.

201
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,120
You don't know the nature of others.

202
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,680
Forget it.

203
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,280
When I find a chance,

204
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,040
I'll be the snake brother and sneak into the forest.

205
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,480
Master,

206
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,040
the late emperor's mansion is still fighting.

207
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,720
The competition is about to begin.

208
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,320
The new disciples of the Eight Great Palace

209
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,600
have arrived at the martial arts arena.

210
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,960
The grandmaster

211
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,360
and the princess of the Eight Great Palace

212
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,000
should be here soon.

213
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,320
Master,

214
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,960
I have something to ask you.

215
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,640
The people of the Eight Great Palace

216
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,480
have made you suffer so much in the past 500 years.

217
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,520
Why didn't you kill them all

218
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,640
on the day we left the Pass?

219
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,520
What if they unite

220
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,880
and seal you again?

221
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,920
If I kill them all,

222
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,240
I can't manage

223
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,120
the mess of the late emperor's mansion.

224
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,400
You can support

225
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,920
your new princess

226
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,080
to manage the late emperor's mansion.

227
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,360
Everyone is greedy.

228
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,040
No one will take it seriously.

229
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,120
Master,

230
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,640
should we just let them go?

231
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,400
They did so many bad things.

232
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,400
How can I be so kind to them?

233
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,200
I want those who once insulted me

234
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,440
to suffer in fear.

235
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,280
I want to see my most precious thing

236
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,160
being crushed.

237
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,720
After experiencing the despair,

238
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,480
I want them to die.

239
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,440
Does it

240
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,840
include Shi Qianli?

241
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,080
Shi Qianli

242
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,760
Master,

243
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,400
you are getting weaker

244
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,280
now.

245
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,200
Please drink this bowl of soup.

246
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,440
It will help you recover from your wound.

247
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,840
If I die,

248
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,000
their soul dreams will also be shattered.

249
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,160
No matter how angry you are,

250
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,480
don't be angry with your body.

251
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,000
Come on, drink the soup.

252
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,560
Good boy.

253
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,080
Master, eat some.

254
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,480
If you don't want to eat,

255
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,240
can you give it to me?

256
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,280
What is this soup?

257
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,040
It's the blood of the Sima clan.

258
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,880
Why did you lie to me?

259
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,040
Does Shi Qianli know what it is?

260
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,720
Yes.

261
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,000
The master is trying to help you recover

262
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,280
and feed the red mountain forest.

263
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,880
You are all bad guys.

264
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,040
You are all bad guys.

265
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,640
The eight great masters are just a prelude.

266
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:10,880
Shi Qianli

267
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,880
is the most interesting one.

268
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,960
I think Shi Qianli's cultivation

269
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,800
is not as good as the other princesses.

270
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,480
Since the other princesses are in the realm

271
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,000
and are not controlled by the truth,

272
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,480
let's start with Shi Qianli.

273
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,960
Wu Neng is just a disguise of Shi Qianli.

274
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,000
He must have a defensive strategy.

275
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,080
Don't alert him.

276
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,560
Let him make a mess

277
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,640
so that he can show his weakness.

278
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,800
Such a comfortable staff dormitory.

279
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,920
Where can I find it?

280
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,240
The office environment is like a scenic spot.

281
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,520
With this kind of beauty,

282
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,840
it would be nice to lose a beautiful hair

283
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,840
and change into a beautiful dress.

284
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,680
Is it so sweet?

285
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,320
Are these all for me?

286
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,320
There is also a guest room service.

287
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,320
Isn't the puppet man a robot?

288
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,320
The skin texture is the same as a real person.

289
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,800
Can you get me some more jewelry and shoes?

290
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,800
Do you want to take it or not?

291
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,080
I finally understand

292
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,720
what is the god of the Happy Temple.

293
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,640
Now everyone thinks

294
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,400
I am the boss's confidant.

295
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,800
He was so arrogant when he went out.

296
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,040
I am going to resign.

297
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,200
What if everyone asks me to quit?

298
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,560
Moreover,

299
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,480
although the teacher sometimes

300
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,280
looks not very good,

301
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,360
but he is still nice to me.

302
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,440
He saved me so many times.

303
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,920
Moreover, I have to rely on him to soothe my pain.

304
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,000
I'd better not think about resignation first.

305
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,200
Grandmaster.

306
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,880
Why are you here?

307
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:54,840
Come with me.

308
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,120
Okay.

309
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,280
Greetings, Grandmaster.

310
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,080
Grandmaster.

311
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,320
Why are we here?

312
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,360
Let's start.

313
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,280
This is the competition of the world of the immortals.

314
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,240
Come on.

315
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Please try some chances.

316
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,040
Allows people to pause and wait.

317
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,880
Okay, wait for him.

318
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,080
Watch this.

319
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,000
It's early.

320
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,320
Wait for me.

321
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,120
I'm here.

322
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,280
Master.

323
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,560
Master.

324
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,660
What's the matter with you

325
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,740
since you want to watch us fight.

326
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,760
It's the pleasure

327
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,760
to see pulled ones fight.

328
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,720
Master.

329
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,240
Please allow me to say more.

330
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,440
The two on the stage

331
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,840
are both from the Heaven,

332
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,680
and one is from the Sun.

333
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,040
They are all

334
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,360
excellent disciples

335
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,840
cultivated by the princesses

336
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,560
with great efforts.

337
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,520
It's not appropriate to hurt anyone.

338
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,400
Can you

339
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,040
let them go

340
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,840
for the sake of the Shi family?

341
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,360
Let them go?

342
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,720
If we're to fight in one-challenge,

343
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,840
our disciples

344
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,720
will gain more knowledge

345
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,440
during their lifetime county court.

346
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,600
What's more, with the pretensions on everyone's cowardship,

347
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,280
no rules have been implemented

348
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,040
already, do they?

349
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,320
Commander Shi

350
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,960
is aware of their actions.

351
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,160
He sets up this kind of tradition?

352
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,960
You should fight seriously.

353
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,480
Don't be careless.

354
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,280
What did we do wrong?

355
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,800
We were just left behind by our fellow disciples.

356
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,520
Exactly.

357
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,760
We killed the innocent.

358
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,800
We did it for the good cause.

359
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,920
We were competing

360
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,800
to improve each other's cultivation.

361
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,560
Why did we have to risk our lives?

362
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,600
Exactly.

363
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,880
Isn't this the rule

364
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,400
that you eight masters set?

365
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,920
Now you say that others are bad people.

366
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,360
It's so unfair.

367
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,200
You said I was bad.

368
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,120
I killed the innocent.

369
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,080
Let me see

370
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,360
how much you can pay

371
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,240
for your good deeds.

372
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,200
What's this?

373
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,880
It looks like a blood flower.

374
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,040
Really?

375
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,080
Is this the blood flower in the legend?

376
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,240
Does everyone around

377
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,800
who can win twenty empty fights

378
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,680
will get

379
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,960
book- winner blood petals?

380
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,460
Bro, sorry for your oversight.

381
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,240
Shishu.

382
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:09,980
You...

383
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,480
It's the Huening Flower.

384
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:12,780
A Huening Flower

385
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,480
can easily be Grandpa Zhang's between 1000 years of cultivation.

386
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,420
All we have cultivated

387
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,320
is just for this?

388
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,960
It's all my fault for fighting for this definitions and disciplines.

389
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,200
8th Lord's princesses

390
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,340
agree with that.

391
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,940
Is that Familienade can be a 720 thousand years with this kind of strategy?

392
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,640
What are you doing?

393
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,360
Are these disciples crazy?

394
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,360
It's just a competition.

395
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,360
Why are they killing each other?

396
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,360
It's completely different from what happened just now.

397
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,360
It's just a man's conscience.

398
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,360
Now it's just a sudden pen and a line.

399
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,360
It's just a competition.

400
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,360
Master,

401
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,360
did Master want to kill all the excellent disciples we have?

402
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,360
Actually, it's not what Master did.

403
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,360
It's just those disciples being greedy.

404
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,360
My disciples are dead.

405
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,360
Of course you're talking nonsense here.

406
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,360
Princess Shi, don't worry.

407
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,360
I really didn't expect that

408
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,360
a little child

409
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,360
would turn into this.

410
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,360
Today's battle

411
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,360
is just a warning

412
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,360
for you.

413
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,360
Master,

414
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,360
you're the head of the eight palaces

415
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,360
and a trusted follower of Master.

416
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,360
You can't let him

417
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,360
be so relaxed.

418
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,360
Master,

419
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,360
we're counting on you.

420
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,360
Okay.

421
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,360
Don't worry.

422
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,360
I will try my best to calm him down.

423
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,360
But

424
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,360
Master just left the mountain.

425
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,360
He's still angry.

426
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,360
As long as he doesn't overdo it,

427
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,360
we'll just

428
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,360
keep our eyes closed.

429
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,360
Just say what you want to say.

430
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,360
Master,

431
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,360
the blood-shrouded flowers you brought today,

432
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,360
they seem to want them very much.

433
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,360
But didn't you say

434
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,360
that the blood-shrouded flowers

435
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,360
need your blood?

436
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,360
Otherwise,

437
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,360
they'll explode.

438
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,360
But

439
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,360
today,

440
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,360
none of them

441
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,360
drank your blood.

442
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,360
Even if they got the blood-shrouded flowers,

443
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,360
what's the use?

444
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,360
It's not my blood.

445
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,360
It's the blood of the Fengshan Clan.

446
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,360
Aren't you the only one left

447
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,360
in the Fengshan Clan?

448
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,360
Yes.

449
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,360
The people of Sima clan

450
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,360
are all the same.

451
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,360
There's only one bone left

452
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,360
of the people of Sima clan.

453
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,360
But they can't keep their bodies.

454
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,360
Do you know why?

455
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,360
It's because

456
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,360
the blood-shrouded flowers

457
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,360
are both good medicine

458
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,360
that can improve their cultivation.

459
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,360
They'll be divided

460
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,360
by the families of the Gengchen clan.

461
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,360
According to the current situation,

462
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,360
those who dare to take the blood-shrouded flowers,

463
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,360
the disciples here

464
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,360
have all drunk the blood

465
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,360
of the people of Sima clan.

466
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,360
I'm sorry.

467
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,360
You can't stand it anymore?

468
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,360
The Demon Lord's Sword

469
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,360
is more upright

470
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,360
than the previous one.

471
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,360
It's very strange.

472
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,360
Forget it.

473
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,360
Just ignore it.

474
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,360
The Demon Lord's Sword

475
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,360
is more upright

476
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,360
than the previous one.

477
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,360
Forget it.

478
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,360
Just ignore it.

479
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,360
Forget it.

480
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,360
Forget it.

481
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,360
Forget it.

482
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,360
Forget it.

483
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,360
Forget it.

484
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,360
Forget it.

485
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,360
Forget it.

486
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,360
Forget it.

487
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,360
Forget it.

488
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,360
Forget it.

489
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,360
Forget it.

490
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,360
Forget it.

491
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,360
Better than this.

492
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,360
You're traitors.

493
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,360
We've got nothing to learn.

494
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,360
Forget it.

495
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,360
Forget it.

496
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,360
Forget it.

497
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,360
Forget it.

498
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,360
Forget it.

499
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,360
Come on, come on.

500
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,360
Put the cup on me.

501
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,360
It smells so good.

502
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,120
Go!

503
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,160
So the boss grew up

504
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,600
in such a people-eating environment.

505
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,000
No wonder he has a lot of hatred for this world.

506
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,640
As the boss's confidant,

507
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,680
shouldn't I go and express my feelings

508
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,440
and comfort him?

509
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,840
No, no, no.

510
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,840
Liao Ting Yan, Liao Ting Yan.

511
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,840
You're just a idle fish

512
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,040
who relies on Tang Ping to survive.

513
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,720
You're already very lucky

514
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,280
for this.

515
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,240
Don't be so self-righteous, okay?

516
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,560
Boss, why are you here?

517
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,320
I understand.

518
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,640
It must be the firewood

519
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,840
that made you sick again.

520
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
What's going on?

521
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,520
Is it still so annoying?

522
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,200
The air conditioner doesn't work today.

523
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,760
Snow hasn't stopped,

524
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,760
the night hasn't stopped.

525
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,600
The silence of three lives...

526
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,800
Go to sleep.

527
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,800
That's you.

528
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,000
It's a bit like the boss is still working overtime

529
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
and telling me to get off work first.

530
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,600
It's so ridiculous.

531
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,600
Then...

532
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,000
I'll go to sleep.

533
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I'll go to sleep.

534
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I'll go to sleep.

535
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I'll go to sleep.

536
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I'll go to sleep.

537
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I'll go to sleep.

538
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Then...

539
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I'll go to sleep.

540
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I'll go to sleep.

541
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Boss.

542
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
You...

543
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I...

544
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Did you sleep well?

545
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
After all, the benefits of this job are too good.

546
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
It's also necessary to save the boss.

547
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Sima Jiao

548
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
should be an unruly businesswoman.

549
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Just let her stay.

550
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
It's true.

551
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Not only can she change the tablecloth that the empress brought,

552
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
she can also calm my anger.

553
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Wake up.

554
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Wake up.

555
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Get up.

556
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Don't sleep.

557
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
What's the matter, dear boss?

558
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Can you understand the beauty of beauty?

559
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Sleeping is not enough.

560
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I have a dark circle.

561
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
How can you sleep?

562
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Why can't I sleep?

563
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I'm here.

564
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And then?

565
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
The whole Gengchen's mansion

566
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
has heard my name.

567
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
No one is afraid of me.

568
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
How can you sleep with me in peace?

569
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
The sleep quality is too good.

570
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
You can't blame me.

571
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
You really make people not understand.

572
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Okay.

573
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Although the boss is a night-time driver,

574
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I have to sacrifice my life to accompany the gentleman.

575
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Night-time driver?

576
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
You are the one who is unstable in the seat.

577
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Where did you get so many strange words?

578
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Probably I...

579
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Four-leafed knot.

580
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
The End

581
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Father.

582
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I heard that the four-leafed knot

583
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
made the disciples fight against each other.

584
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
All died because of the goodwill of the eight great masters.

585
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
What do the other princesses think about it?

586
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Did they put pressure on you?

587
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Of course they are dissatisfied.

588
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
But they won't protest in public for the time being.

589
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
After all, no one wants to make trouble.

590
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Besides, Tian Wuya and I cooperate with each other.

591
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
As long as we don't kill them,

592
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
it doesn't matter if the master kills a few people.

593
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
If he really wants to kill us all,

594
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
he will also be hurt by both sides.

595
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
He won't get any benefits.

596
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Besides, the new princess has just been appointed.

597
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Now the situation is unstable.

598
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
They are in a bad mood.

599
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I can't help it.

600
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Father,

601
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
should we just let the four-leafed knot

602
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
make trouble?

603
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I'm afraid the eight great masters

604
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
will be out of our control.

605
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
The four-leafed knot has been sealed for so long.

606
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
The anger in the heart can't be eliminated.

607
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
We have to deal with some people

608
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
to calm down.

609
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Besides,

610
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Si De is a disciple.

611
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
He can kill anyone he wants.

612
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Now he is a madman.

613
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
He is not a good person.

614
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Father,

615
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
although he is a madman,

616
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
at least he can listen to me.

617
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
We just have to be careful and take care of him.

618
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Before the great plan is completed,

619
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
we have to stabilize the eight great masters

620
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
and do our best.

621
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
We can't let the four-leafed knot

622
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
be too crazy.

623
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Grandmaster,

624
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
the disciples of the great masters

625
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
have already arrived at the martial arts arena.

626
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I also asked

627
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
when the fight today will start.

628
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
For the blood-sweeping flower,

629
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
they even gave up their lives.

630
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I think the four-leafed knot

631
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
and the eight great masters

632
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
don't care about

633
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
the lives of these disciples.

634
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
After the last fight,

635
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
the four-leafed knot

636
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
was just a little bit calmed down

637
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
and wanted to resolve it.

638
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
It seems that the four-leafed knot

639
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
has a hidden power in the eight great masters.

640
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Hidden power?

641
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Is it Tian Wu Ya?

642
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Only she and the four-leafed knot

643
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
are closer to each other.

644
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Bai Lu Ya's spiritual veins

645
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
should be monitored by the four-leafed knot.

646
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
It seems that the four-leafed knot

647
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
has given her some tips.

648
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
What?

649
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
No wonder her recent cultivation

650
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
has grown so fast.

651
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I heard that

652
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
she has a harmonious system.

653
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
The four-leafed knot is too evil.

654
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
These spiritual veins

655
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
are not all her.

656
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
She is just a doorkeeper.

657
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Why should she be on the side of the grandmaster?

658
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Tian Wu Ya

659
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
is a good teacher.

660
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
She is just a name for a play.

661
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Father

662
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
the cultivation of the four-leafed knot

663
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
has grown so fast.

664
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Will she be able to

665
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
break free from the chains one day?

666
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Wu Ya, don't worry.

667
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
The eight sealed hairpins

668
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
have been put into her body.

669
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Even if she can break free from the chains one day,

670
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
she can't get rid of the pressure of the sealed hairpins.

671
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
What if

672
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
she can't stand the pain and kill herself?

673
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
What should we do?

674
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
After all, her life is connected to the spiritual fire.

675
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
If she dies,

676
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
the spiritual veins of the immortal will be lost.

677
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
The forbidden technique is forbidden.

678
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
What the young princess said makes sense.

679
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I wonder what you think.

680
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
In my opinion,

681
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
why don't we put another forbidden technique

682
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
on this seal?

683
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
You just said

684
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
how many of her cultivation is in her body?

685
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Tian Wu Ya's cultivation

686
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
should be in the harmony period.

687
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Is there a banquet today?

688
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Yes.

689
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
The Tian Zhi Palace is holding a banquet today.

690
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
It should be very lively

691
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
to invite all the disciples to participate.

692
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Very good.

693
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Then let's

694
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
go and have a good time

695
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
with Tian Wu Ya.

696
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Okay, Master.

697
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
When shall we set off?

698
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Wake up with Liao Ting Yan.

699
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Are you

700
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
caring about Ting Yan?

701
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Do you want Ting Yan to sleep a little longer?

702
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Do you dare to guess my thoughts now?

703
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
The feeling of being naturally asleep

704
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
is the feeling of being hurt.

705
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
This...

706
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Let me see

707
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
what beautiful clothes she sent me.

708
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Demon Mirror, Demon Mirror,

709
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
tell me

710
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
who is the most beautiful woman

711
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
in the world?

712
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
It's Liao Ting Yan.

713
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
It's a miracle.

714
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Happy makeup.

715
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Boss.

716
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Let's go.

717
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I just got off work yesterday.

718
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Can you not work overtime today?

719
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
What is overtime?

720
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Just like you now.

721
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
You want me to wait for 24 hours.

722
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I'm not going to work overtime.

723
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I'm going to sleep.

724
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
So you don't want to come with me?

725
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
It's not that I don't want to.

726
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Why not?

727
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I'm afraid of seeing the dead.

728
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
A demon woman is afraid of the dead.

729
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I'll kill you first if you don't go.

730
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Wait for me to change into a more elegant dress.

731
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Follow me.

732
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Wait for me to change into a new dress.

733
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
This full-fledged country...

734
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Boss,

735
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
where are we going?

736
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
To kill someone.

737
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Boss.

738
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
The sand is falling.

739
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
The flowers are still in bloom.

740
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Light up all the fireflies.

741
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I'm waiting for you to come to me.

742
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I'm going to break through the poisonous hole.

743
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
The heaven's rules are going to be turned into a whirlpool.

744
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I'm waiting for you to come to me.

745
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Life and death are like fire.

746
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I'm waiting for you to come to me.

747
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I'm going to break through the poisonous hole.

748
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
It's right and wrong.

749
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Rumors spread.

750
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I'll never let go of my fate.

751
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
You.

752
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
For me.

753
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
For the

754
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
wounds on my body.

755
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
The sea is warm.

756
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
The rain falls.

757
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,000
It's me.

758
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
You.

759
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
For me.

760
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
For the

761
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
sincere surrender.

762
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Facing the promise.

763
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
It seems to be a waste.

764
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Light up the fireflies.

765
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
More.
