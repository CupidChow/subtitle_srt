1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,440
Ep legitimately

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Like the heavy rain, I'll be in the heaven and earth

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The wind and the moon are the most distant

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But between them, love can be exchanged

5
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Who loves me is not destined

6
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
If I can't love for the rest of my life

7
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Even if this life is endless and I can't live it

8
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I still want to be with you

9
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Even if this life is endless and I can't live it

10
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Only a few months

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
before I met you, I couldn't recognize you

12
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The soul period we discussed before has passed

13
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Let's go. Take me to a place

14
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The sky is going to shine if we don't sleep

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Sima Jiao, disturbing people's dreams is the most immoral behavior

16
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You

17
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm sorry

18
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm sorry

19
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm sorry

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm sorry

21
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Aren't you in Biguan?

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
When was this garden built?

23
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Do you want to have a wedding here?

24
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Do you think it's familiar?

25
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
A little

26
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
This is built according to your soul

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
When I first entered your soul

28
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I was attracted to this clouded atmosphere

29
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I was attracted to this clouded atmosphere

30
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's good that you like it

31
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Why bother to see it again?

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
If you feel uneasy in the future

33
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You can come here and sleep

34
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Everything will be fine

35
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
As long as you are by my side

36
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
All the unease will disappear

37
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
This tree smells so good

38
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
This is a scented wood

39
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Under the sun

40
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It will spread a light fragrance

41
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
This fragrance can relieve the pain

42
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And suppress the disturbance in your body

43
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
When I'm disturbed

44
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You can't solve it yourself

45
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I don't have to go to work

46
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
When did you become a snake?

47
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That's because someone wants to touch the fish

48
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
This place is so comfortable to sleep

49
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I feel sleepy when I lie down

50
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Sleep if you are sleepy

51
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'll accompany you

52
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'll accompany you

53
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'll accompany you

54
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'll accompany you

55
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'll accompany you

56
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'll accompany you

57
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'll accompany you

58
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'll accompany you

59
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'll accompany you

60
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'll accompany you

61
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'll accompany you

62
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'll accompany you

63
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'll accompany you

64
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'll accompany you

65
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'll accompany you

66
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'll accompany you

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What are you doing?

68
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Why did you give all the cultivation to me?

69
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,320
I am sorry.

70
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,160
I don't know if I can lap down his destroyers.

71
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,960
已經開始了

72
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,480
什麼快開始了

73
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:26,880
You're an asshole.

74
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,040
Do tell me

75
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
This wound is not painful or itchy.

76
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Do you know?

77
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What are you trying to do?

78
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I've trained the spirit of the Mountain of Wind.

79
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I've trained my blood soul.

80
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
In a while, this will be yours.

81
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You're forced to do this?

82
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Are you crazy?

83
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Don't worry.

84
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It won't hurt.

85
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'll leave this to you.

86
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
In the future, if there's nothing that can hurt you,

87
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'll kill all of our enemies.

88
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What I'm leaving to you is everything you like.

89
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Why?

90
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You're fine.

91
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Why did you do this?

92
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Ting Yan.

93
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I can't be long-lasting.

94
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
No.

95
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You know best.

96
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
No.

97
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
There's an endless fire.

98
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It gave me all the power to make a living.

99
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It will take away everything from me.

100
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
No.

101
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Since I've integrated the new spirit of fire,

102
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
my body has started to collapse.

103
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
After several intensive injuries,

104
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm sure...

105
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
No.

106
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Si Ma is destined to die.

107
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
No.

108
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And I...

109
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
will die too.

110
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Once I die,

111
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
the spirit in my body will also die.

112
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
No.

113
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
But I'm not willing to believe it.

114
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm also not at ease.

115
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
No.

116
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Have you asked me?

117
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I don't want to.

118
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Ting Yan.

119
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Ting Yan.

120
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
The demon in your body

121
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
has completely integrated with your inner energy.

122
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It can't be followed.

123
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
No.

124
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Only this spirit can suppress it now.

125
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
From now on,

126
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
you will be the second me

127
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
to have the power to surpass all living beings.

128
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
With my spirit,

129
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
you won't have to suffer the pain brought by the spirit fire.

130
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
God wants to kill me.

131
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
But I don't want to give this life to him.

132
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I only love you in this world.

133
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's for you, of course.

134
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Si Ma.

135
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You can't make it.

136
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
If you die,

137
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I will be the wife of thousands of people.

138
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Once you die,

139
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I will have hundreds of men.

140
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
There won't be anyone else.

141
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You can't forget me in this life.

142
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You're so beautiful.

143
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Why do you do whatever you want?

144
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I won't let you do as you wish.

145
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Ting Yan.

146
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Live well.

147
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
No matter where you are,

148
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
no matter how far you are,

149
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I will be by your side.

150
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Even if it's just a little bit of a crisis,

151
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I will be with you

152
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
in your ears.

153
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
If you're not here,

154
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
why would I live in this world?

155
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Si Ma.

156
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Si Ma.

157
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Si Ma.

158
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Si Ma.

159
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Si Ma.

160
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It seems that

161
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
this is for me.

162
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,900
Because I'm wearing the Zhenhe

163
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
No matter what your name is,

164
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I won't be wrong.

165
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What if I can't remember it all the time?

166
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It doesn't matter.

167
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
We have plenty of time

168
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
to start over.

169
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I will be with you.

170
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
We can start over.

171
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You must survive.

172
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You must survive.

173
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
We can start from the beginning.

174
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Find your peace.

175
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Fight with him to the death.

176
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
This is my concern.

177
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You must relax.

178
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:55,000
In the past, our immortal talisman and the devil's jade were divided into two empires with the Yin and Yang fox as the barrier.

179
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Fortunately, the current immortal demon princess combined the two realms into one.

180
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Afterwards, the princess merged with the spiritual fire and had endless power.

181
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
She guarded both our realms and became a prosperous and prosperous world.

182
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
But I heard that the princess was the spirit fire that her unmarried husband, the Taoist priest, took after he was killed.

183
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
That Taoist priest was so terrifying.

184
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's clear that the princess is even more cruel to kill him.

185
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's really making people feel scared.

186
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's good that you're scared.

187
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Those people who are so devoted to their hearts.

188
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I heard that after the princess killed the Taoist priest, she wouldn't dare to be a second-rate again.

189
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
That's right.

190
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Not to mention that the princess only loves the people and cares about the people.

191
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
This is a common view.

192
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Teacher, which side do you think is the real princess?

193
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
That's right.

194
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Teacher, we have to leave this to the people of the immortal demon to judge.

195
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I only know that in order to promote the fusion of the immortal demon and the world's peace,

196
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
the princess did a lot of wrongs and was highly rewarded.

197
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Brother Li, Brother Gu, you're finally here.

198
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

199
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
This time, we've come up with some tricks to discuss with everyone.

200
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Now that the immortal demon has disappeared, it's convenient for both sides to meet.

201
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You guys actually came just now?

202
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
We just wanted to prepare for it and then come to the Demon Citadel to study.

203
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Okay. Let's talk at my house.

204
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Okay. Let's go.

205
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Please.

206
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Let's go.

207
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Let's go home.

208
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Please take care of the house.

209
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Be careful.

210
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Just go back and ask Fang Zi to grab the medicine.

211
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Thank you.

212
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Thank you.

213
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Teacher.

214
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
My head hurts.

215
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Here. Madam, it's not a big deal.

216
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
This is your prescription and your medicine supplement.

217
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I came to get the medicine and even got snacks for me.

218
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I never dared to think about it before.

219
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Thank you. Thank you.

220
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Please sit.

221
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Princess Yuan, did you secretly write the official documents yesterday?

222
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I came here yesterday without any reason.

223
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
So I hid the official documents of these five days in advance.

224
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm just following the rules set by the two immortal demons.

225
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I work four hours a day.

226
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
If you don't take responsibility,

227
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
how can you let the people follow the rules and follow the rules?

228
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Please calm down, Princess.

229
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I know my mistake.

230
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Did you all hear that?

231
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
If you violate the rules of the four-hour work,

232
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
you will be reduced to half a year's salary.

233
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

234
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
If there is nothing else, you can leave the court.

235
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Please take care, Princess.

236
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
The city sky

237
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Sleep so sweetly

238
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Do you have a dream?

239
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Where have you been these years?

240
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Leave

241
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Parting from the south

242
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I know

243
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
The growth of love

244
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Sima Jiao

245
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Sima Jiao

246
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Sima Jiao

247
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
The moon is still shining

248
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'm afraid my memories are blocked

249
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
After a trip

250
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
A trip

251
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
A three-life meeting

252
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I believe

253
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Every time I fall in love

254
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
The colors in our mirror

255
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
What did you say?

256
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
The fragrance of this book

257
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Can be easily controlled

258
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
The real inner struggle is all a lie

259
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
The heart makes me dream every day

260
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I can't forget you, can I?

261
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
The heart makes me dream every day

262
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I can't forget you, can I?

263
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
You were

264
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
also suffering from spiritual fire and pain

265
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
But you always pretend to be fine

266
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
The princess is so selfish

267
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It will hurt the body

268
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Back then

269
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
In order to purify A Yan's internal organs

270
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
She burned her own flesh and soul

271
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And put the purified spirit into her body

272
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
She is now the princess of the demon

273
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
How can she forget this love?

274
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
The princess is kind and the princess is kind

275
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
She used her flesh and soul to purify her spirit

276
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
She purified the demon

277
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And the spirit was separated

278
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
The princess didn't want the spirit to be left

279
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
She left the spirit

280
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
She used magic to save the spirit

281
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
But the spirit was not there

282
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
The demon in her body

283
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Was not completely clean

284
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
And she

285
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Had to suffer from spiritual fire and pain day and night

286
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
The spirit was burned for only one month

287
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
And the princess didn't find the right body

288
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
She could only put the spirit

289
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
In the heaven and earth

290
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And find her own way

291
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
A Yan doesn't know where her spirit is

292
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
But

293
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
We must let her drink this medicine

294
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
We can't help her

295
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
At least

296
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
We can help her to relieve her pain

297
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Now the world is peaceful

298
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It's the peace I've been longing for

299
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Si Ma Jiao

300
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It would be great if you were here

301
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
You are here, sir

302
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm here to supervise your medicine

303
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Your master said

304
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
This medicine is especially for the pain in your body

305
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
You must drink it to be effective

306
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Come on

307
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It's very effective

308
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It will hurt for a few days every month

309
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Not only the pain

310
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,520
The internal

311
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,000
Blood in your body has been suppressed

312
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
But it will still be annoying

313
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
This medicine can help you feel better

314
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Drink it, be good

315
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I deserve it

316
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
For my good reason

317
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Let's go to the food street in Yan City to have a meal

318
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Eat again

319
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
The food in the food street

320
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Come on, eat

321
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Come on

322
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I like everything you left for me

323
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
But without you

324
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
What's the point of liking it?

325
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Look

326
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Your way of learning and protecting

327
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
The way to share the magic is really effective

328
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Look at the street now

329
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
The magic is all in one family

330
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Right?

331
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
How about this one?

332
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Ok

333
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Go

334
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Boss, we haven't ordered yet

335
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Did we order wrongly?

336
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Your Highness, welcome

337
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
These are the dishes I gave you

338
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Please enjoy

339
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Your store is so small

340
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
You gave me so many dishes

341
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
How to make a living today?

342
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'll pay you

343
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
No, no, no

344
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Your Highness, you are young and young

345
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
You have taken good care of us

346
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
These dishes are not good

347
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Please enjoy

348
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I'm very kind to you now

349
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Everyone looks at me as a ghost

350
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
You have to understand

351
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
After all, you have recognized the reputation of Sima Jiao

352
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
And now you have integrated the spirit

353
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
He planned this

354
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Just to make everyone dare not to bother me

355
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
If he sees you

356
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You have managed the two realms so well

357
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
He must be very happy

358
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Ok, ok, drink

359
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
The state preceptor, Hong Luo

360
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
is very diligent

361
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
He is very polite

362
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Of course

363
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I don't see you meeting Nian Jiu

364
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
He

365
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
He is a good teacher

366
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I can't meet a big figure like him

367
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
He is very secretive now

368
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
He can't even see a shadow

369
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I don't have time to see him

370
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
How about being with me?

371
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
He just left suddenly

372
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
It's strange

373
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Where did he go?

374
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
You haven't asked him?

375
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Of course I have

376
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
He doesn't want to tell me

377
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I'm angry when I see him

378
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
You said

379
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
If she didn't feel guilty,

380
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,000
why would she act like this all the time?

381
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,200
What's wrong with her?

382
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,400
Didn't she just propose to you two days ago?

383
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,200
It's fine if it's not a good thing.

384
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,200
No, no, no.

385
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,400
I'm in charge of two things.

386
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,600
You two are in love.

387
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,200
Let's not do this.

388
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,400
I'll help you vent your anger.

389
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,400
I'll go talk to her.

390
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,400
Drink.

391
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,440
I don't think it's like this.

392
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,880
Ting Yan, what are you doing?

393
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,120
You scared me to death.

394
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,840
You're stillBY afraid of it.

395
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,800
Let me ask you.

396
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,800
What have you been up to lately?

397
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,600
It's so messed up.

398
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,200
Chen An He said

399
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,400
you've been so 치안헌 and redundant these days.

400
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,200
You even left Hong Luo behind.

401
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,000
I didn't.

402
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,900
She's decided to leave you.

403
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,200
Hongluo misunderstood me.

404
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,400
I'll explain it to her.

405
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,080
Why don't you explain it to me first?

406
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,520
Explain what?

407
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,440
It's hard to explain.

408
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,000
You want me to do it, right?

409
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,360
If I find out

410
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,120
that you have other girls' scent,

411
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,040
you're done.

412
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,320
Why do you have the scent of four-leaf glue?

413
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,480
What?

414
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,480
You always know where the four-leaf glue is.

415
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,160
You've been hiding it from us for so long.

416
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:42,840
Yes.

417
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,000
19 years ago,

418
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,280
when Grand Master decided to close the Lotus Fire,

419
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,560
he once told me

420
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,960
that if Ting Yan

421
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,280
wanted to leave a soul for him,

422
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,240
I could find it anywhere.

423
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,400
Grand Master

424
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,440
had something he wanted to do,

425
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,000
but he didn't tell me.

426
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,560
But we couldn't

427
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,000
make him take the Soul-resisting Pill in time.

428
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,840
So he should have no memory now.

429
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,160
How could he

430
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,280
do as the plan before?

431
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,120
Maybe

432
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,120
Grand Master has his own way.

433
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,200
If you want to know everything,

434
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,000
we can let Grand Master

435
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,440
recover his memory through spiritual cultivation.

436
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,080
No.

437
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,440
Grand Master is not used to it yet.

438
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,080
Ting Yan,

439
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,960
Grand Master's soul

440
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,760
can't hold the memories of the past.

441
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,480
I once suggested to him,

442
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,960
I told him

443
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,120
that he could tell me

444
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,520
what he wanted to do.

445
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,360
I would tell him after I found him.

446
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,080
But Grand Master said

447
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,960
even if he had no memory,

448
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,080
he wouldn't believe what others said.

449
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,120
If I told him,

450
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,440
he would remember it.

451
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,760
He knows his own way.

452
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:04,840
Ting Yan,

453
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,400
don't be angry.

454
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,000
Grand Master

455
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,320
really doesn't want you to worry.

456
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,600
How could I not worry?

457
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,200
Even Heng Shu is worried.

458
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,760
You'd better tell me where he is.

459
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,560
Tell me.

460
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,440
Where is he now?

461
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,880
He is

462
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,400
in the mortal world now.

463
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,040
Nineteen years ago,

464
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,480
Grand Master was born as a prince of the protection of the country.

465
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,000
But Grand Master was a young man.

466
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
He couldn't take the throne.

467
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,640
Many people wanted to kill him

468
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,160
to take the throne.

469
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,960
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

470
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,800
Shut up!

471
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,800
How could you

472
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,520
do such a thing in front of His Majesty?

473
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,240
Guards!

474
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,120
Drag him out!

475
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,280
Please forgive me, Your Majesty!

476
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,560
Please forgive me, Your Majesty!

477
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,800
So I have to go to the mortal world

478
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,400
to protect Grand Master.

479
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,240
He is really

480
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,200
a grandfather.

481
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,440
Since he went to the mortal world to be an emperor,

482
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,200
does he need to be an emperor

483
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,680
to accomplish what he wants to do?

484
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,880
I don't know.

485
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,240
But

486
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,320
some time ago,

487
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,240
Grand Master was in Liyang County

488
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,840
for a private visit.

489
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,720
But he was attacked by bandits.

490
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,360
So I went to protect him.

491
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,360
Hongluo,

492
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,080
I was delayed

493
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,680
because of this matter.

494
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,640
You should have told me earlier.

495
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,640
Grand Master didn't allow me to tell you.

496
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,480
Fine.

497
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,480
I'll see how he can use the country.

498
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:57,640
Ting Yi,

499
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,600
Ting Yi,

500
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,640
you can't go to the mortal world like this.

501
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:01,800
There is almost no spiritual power

502
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,880
in the country.

503
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,280
There is no basic sect of cultivating immortals.

504
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,920
They are all mortals.

505
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,120
We cultivators

506
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,360
are like legends there.

507
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,280
People have never heard of it.

508
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,320
Focus.

509
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,640
The higher the cultivation level,

510
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,080
the higher the limit.

511
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,040
Ting Yi,

512
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,800
you are the most powerful person

513
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,520
in the world.

514
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,920
So the limit you have

515
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,880
is the highest.

516
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:30,960
In there,

517
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,040
you can only use the most basic magic.

518
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,320
Otherwise, you will be in great pain

519
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,880
and even be counteracted.

520
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:38,640
It doesn't matter.

521
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,520
I am familiar with the way.

522
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:41,960
One more thing.

523
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,480
Youyan

524
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,440
may use Bi'an's body

525
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,600
to return to the world.

526
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,640
What?

527
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,920
The blood of Mount Feng

528
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,000
can nourish Youyan's spirit.

529
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,360
Besides,

530
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,200
Bi'an has disappeared for so long

531
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,200
and has no sound.

532
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,320
I'm afraid

533
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,280
Ting Yan,

534
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,600
our grand master is really worried about you.

535
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,480
That's why he didn't tell you.

536
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:04,640
Besides,

537
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,840
Youyan is now

538
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,120
hiding in the two lands of the immortals and demons.

539
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,920
And she is hiding in the human world.

540
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,240
We don't know it yet.

541
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,960
So you must be careful

542
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,120
when you go out this time.

543
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,480
Okay, I got it.

544
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:15,800
I'll go with you.

545
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,240
And,

546
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,600
you can't let them

547
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,680
find out your identity.

548
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:19,480
Got it.

549
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,360
Or it will be more troublesome

550
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,520
if the world is in chaos.

551
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,400
Many years ago

552
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,240
there was a threat

553
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,760
but no one wanted to fight it

554
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,000
So we were taught

555
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,600
to be patient and fight it.

556
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,920
Until the day

557
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:42,760
death comes,

558
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,640
no fearsub CATizin

559
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,960
is in danger.

560
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,400
Be careful

561
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,160
and it won't be late

562
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,920
for the henpecked monster king

563
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,960
to kill guys

564
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,000
and turn his life,

565
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,240
all in their hands.

566
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,120
Motivation

567
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,360
Your Majesty

568
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,640
Your Majesty, he is here

569
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,080
I, Li Yang's head, Wei Xianyu

570
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,760
greet Your Majesty

571
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,200
I think

572
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,920
it's a place for the common people

573
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,080
Your Majesty is a rich man

574
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,560
and there is only one eunuch

575
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,200
It's not appropriate to stay here for long

576
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,440
In case

577
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,800
I come here to escort Your Majesty back to your mansion

578
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,200
When Sima Jiao was still a teacher

579
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,360
the outsiders said he was cruel

580
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,480
But what the people see is just the surface

581
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,360
As for Hao Se

582
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,720
he is not stable now

583
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,560
Maybe he needs to be married to pull the court

584
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,560
No matter what he becomes

585
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,720
I can accept it

586
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,480
I just want him to live

587
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,080
Your Majesty

588
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,800
I don't know what I did wrong

589
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,400
to make Your Majesty angry

590
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,400
You appear here

591
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,320
is enough to make me angry

592
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,120
Guards

593
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,560
Take him out

594
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,440
and kill him

595
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,760
Your Majesty

596
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:22,880
Your Majesty

597
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,160
Your Majesty, spare my life

598
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,000
Look, look

599
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:28,880
What's going on?

600
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,480
Stop looking

601
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,560
You, move away

602
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,320
Stop looking

603
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:33,800
Move away

604
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,520
Move away

605
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,320
Move away

606
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,880
Isn't that the head of the army?

607
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,240
The head of the army is always under the pressure of his own guards

608
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:44,920
Yes

609
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,240
There is a destiny in the world

610
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,280
Let's not worry about it

611
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,000
Who do you think will be the head of the army?

612
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,800
You mean

613
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,360
the Grand Master of Wei's Office?

614
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,680
It's possible

615
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,520
If we save him

616
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,680
maybe we can find Sima Jiao

617
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,120
Your Majesty

618
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,680
Have you arranged it?

619
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,400
Your Majesty

620
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,640
I have sent people to save him

621
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,640
when he was in danger

622
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,360
I think he has done it

623
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,120
I'm coming back to report to Your Majesty

624
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,320
Wei Qianyu

625
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,800
is not afraid of death

626
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,040
A few days ago

627
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,120
the attack on the mountain bandits was also his doing

628
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,080
It's a pity that he was lucky to escape

629
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,040
He has betrayed

630
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,720
Killing me again

631
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,120
is an early thing

632
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,560
Now I give him another chance

633
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,800
We can get along with the papas

634
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,320
and catch the arm of Duke Nan Yan

635
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,920
Wei Qianyu

636
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,240
was in danger because of the great Han of Yanzhou

637
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,680
who took his wife and wife to his home

638
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,000
Then he took the military treasure and the silk bag

639
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,920
and killed the people of the grassland

640
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,000
He has a lot of dirty tricks behind him

641
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,360
He is a good general

642
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,280
How can he do this?

643
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,480
He has the benefits of the old fox

644
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,040
Duke Nan Yan

645
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,320
Yes

646
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,320
Duke Nan Yan is also a wolf-like man

647
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,800
Since the beginning of his life

648
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,040
he has been controlling the power of the court and the imperial army

649
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,760
which made his power be weakened

650
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,000
He can only take the throne in the storm

651
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,080
Since his childhood

652
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,240
he has been attacked by many people

653
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,240
He even wore a headdress

654
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,760
It's really painful

655
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,520
So what?

656
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,760
Someone has to

657
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,560
guard the mountain of Wanli

658
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,040
His Majesty is in a critical situation

659
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,720
After that, he will lose his power

660
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,960
Then those wolf-like people

661
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,400
will be more ashamed

662
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,440
What are you doing?

663
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,200
Look, you are counterattacked

664
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,400
I'm under the condition to counterattack

665
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,560
Don't use your spiritual power

666
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,320
Let me do it

667
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:20,840
Kill them

668
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,520
Why did they kill you?

669
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,960
Who gave the order?

670
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,000
It's...

671
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,960
It's Bi...

672
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,200
Your Majesty

673
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,240
Your Majesty

674
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,600
I was ordered to wait at the dock

675
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,720
to save Wei Xian Yu when we were on the way

676
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,520
But I don't know why

677
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,960
I suddenly became blurry

678
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,520
When I recovered

679
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,120
Wei Xian Yu

680
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,600
has been rescued

681
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,560
Go and check who did it

682
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,240
Yes

683
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,640
About today

684
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,160
I wanted to have some fun

685
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:44,600
Send observant Shen

686
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,160
Send Your Highness

687
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,240
I was concerned about her.

688
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,880
So we came to invite you.

689
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,080
Please come with me

690
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,280
to see my husband.

691
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:53,840
I see.

692
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,680
But I met Deng Tuzi.

693
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,040
Deng Tuzi sent someone to rob me.

694
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,160
Don't be rude.

695
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,000
My husband didn't mean to offend you.

696
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,760
I just want to ask you to go to Yingyan Pavilion.

697
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,760
Is your husband Sima Jiao?

698
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,520
How dare you!

699
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,400
This is the name of your husband!

700
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,000
How do you know?

701
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,520
Yingyan Pavilion.

702
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,960
You're so stubborn.

703
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,760
Don't be impulsive.

704
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,840
How can I not be impulsive?

705
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,480
He not only went to the flower house,

706
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,400
but also saw a beautiful girl and even sent someone to rob her.

707
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,240
Didn't you just say

708
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,720
you don't care what she looks like?

709
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,000
As long as she lives well.

710
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,480
No.

711
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,200
I suddenly raised the standard.

712
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:39,960
Okay.

713
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,560
Since you've found her,

714
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,520
I'll go back to the city first.

715
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,640
The rest is up to you.

716
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,920
Tell them I'm closed after I go back.

717
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,640
I'll have my master's assistant.

718
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,160
Please lead the way.

719
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,240
Please.

720
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,280
Miss.

721
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,000
Miss Yi Huo.

722
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,200
His Lordship asked me to tell you something.

723
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,800
The bandits didn't succeed in the previous rebellion.

724
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,560
You need to seize the opportunity to make another move.

725
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,920
Otherwise, if Sima Jiao returns to the palace,

726
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,360
she will lose her chance.

727
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,000
Since Sima Jiao is not kind,

728
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,960
I have no choice.

729
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,320
I have to do something.

730
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,320
I'll go back to the city first.

731
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,360
I'll go back to the city first.

732
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,080
I'll go back to the city first.

733
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,960
I'll go back to the city first.

734
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,840
I can only help you this time.

735
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,120
Please tell His Lordship

736
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,720
I will succeed this time.

737
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:55,000
I'll help His Lordship kill Sima Jiao.

738
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,320
The air of devil elixir and spirit fire

739
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,960
will appear here.

740
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,240
The eye of the Liao Ting merges with the spirit fire.

741
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,760
Why does she come to the mortal world?

742
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,200
petals

743
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,640
This is good.

744
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,880
It's the right time.

745
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,840
I need rest.

746
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,120
Some people

747
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,920
are dying now.

748
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:14,600
Yes.

749
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,960
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

750
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,960
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

751
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,960
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

752
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,960
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

753
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,960
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

754
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,960
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

755
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,960
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

756
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,960
