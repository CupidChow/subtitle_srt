00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,700
 ♫ Heavens strike with thunderous wrath ♫ 

2
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,420
 ♫ Mountains and rivers shatter before my eyes ♫ 

3
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,780
 ♫ Endless splendor
cultivated through lifetimes ♫ 

4
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,540
 ♫ Turns to dust between my fingers
in an instant ♫ 

5
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,220
 ♫ When the line
between good and evil is clear ♫ 

6
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,340
 ♫ Countless souls drift
into the boundless wilds ♫

00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,500
 ♫ Carrying the spirit fire forward ♫

00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,580
 ♫ I defy fate ♫

 ♫ Just to remain by your side ♫

 ♫ Falling into love's abyss ♫ 

11
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,860
 ♫ Like heavy rain pouring down ♫

 ♫ Drunk on romance ♫

 ♫ In a blink, love and hate
vanish into illusion ♫ 

14
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,300
 ♫ Falling into endless love ♫ 

15
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,620
 ♫ Stirring waves upending a lifetime ♫ 

16
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,700
 ♫ Even if this life leads to ruin ♫ 

17
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:27,020
 ♫ I still choose to be entangled with you ♫ 

18
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,125
 ♫ Through all lifetimes ♫ 

19
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:36,580
 

20
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,580
 

21
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,511
 

22
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,160
We're almost out of food again.

23
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,600
After finishing this job,
I'll need to find more work.

24
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,110
Winter City is far.

25
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,970
Leave early and return early.

26
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,140
Be careful on the road.

27
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,750
Don't get yourself hurt.

28
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,330
I won't, Father.

29
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,500
Remember.

30
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,590
Do not expose your identity.

31
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:14,120
Don't worry. I dressed like this
just to hide it.

32
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,190
You may think I nag,

33
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:21,470
but the Immortal-Demon Barrier
has been repaired.

34
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:26,780
That means Sima Jiao has awakened.

35
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,070
 

36
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,880
He's awake?

37
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,560
That's why I'm worried he'll come after you.

38
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,960
If he acts first, your life will be in danger.

39
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,280
Yan, if you hear any news about Sima Jiao...

40
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,370
I must seize the chance to kill him.

41
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,280
Father, you've said this many times.

42
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,560
Sima Jiao is the archenemy of the Shi family.

43
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,240
But the war between the celestial
and demon realms has just ended,

44
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,000
and he has only just awakened,

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,790
he won't come after us so soon.

46
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,240
You lost your memories on Taiwei Mountain.

47
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,910
You have no idea how despicable
Sima Jiao can be.

48
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,470
To secure his position in the Celestial Palace,

49
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:26,070
he used false charges
to destroy whoever defied him.

50
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,280
Back then, the Shi family held power

51
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,910
no less than the Sima family.

52
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,510
He saw us as a thorn in his side.

53
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,350
The battle of Taiwei Mountain

54
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,840
was his perfect scheme to destroy us,

55
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,720
reducing us from a sect master
to this wretched state.

56
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,120
On top of that, the Demon Realm
is hunting the Celestial Palace disciples

57
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,180
to devour their inner cores.

58
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,370
I had no choice

59
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,570
but to stay here,

60
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,560
wasting away at home.

61
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,400
Father, even though Sima Jiao is powerful,

62
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,910
didn't you manage to save me
right under his nose?

63
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:10,240
That was only
at the cost of my son, Zhen Xu's life!

64
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,560
I'm sorry, Father. I didn't mean that.

65
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,880
Zhen Xu gave his life for mine.

66
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,630
I will never forget that.

67
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,830
And Father, you're in this state because of me.

68
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:23,270
I will not forget your care.

69
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,710
That's why I work so hard to earn money,

70
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,800
so I can take you out of this Demon Realm soon.

71
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,950
I don't need you to take me away.

72
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,780
I need you to kill Sima Jiao.

73
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,070
If I were still capable of that,

74
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,490
I would never trouble you with the revenge.

75
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,660
Do you understand?

76
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,000
Put this on.

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,310
This mask conceals your aura.

78
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,220
Sima Jiao can't track you down easily.

79
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,660
It's all for your own good.

80
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:26,020
The moon is full tonight.
A perfect time to cleanse your marrow.

81
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,050
Can we not do it?

82
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,780
Yes.

83
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,290
Yes, we can.

84
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:46,380
But then we'll become sitting ducks
when facing Sima Jiao.

85
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,510
What about this, Yan?

86
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:52,360
Hand me over to him,

87
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,800
and perhaps he would spare your life.

88
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,440
All right, Father.

89
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,700
I'll be back soon.

90
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,990
 I'm starving every day. 

91
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,390
 I can hardly step outside Celestial Crane City, 

92
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,460
 let alone take revenge. 

93
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,800
Unless that big bad Sima Jiao

94
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,000
comes right up to me to be killed,

95
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,490
I wouldn't throw my life away.

96
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,020
Or else, I'll end up like you.

97
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,019
 

98
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,310
Talk about bad luck.

99
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:33,310
I was just trying to go to work,
but then I died by accident.

100
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,630
Later, I came into this world.

101
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:38,800
Of all places,
I came to this brutal Demon Realm.

102
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,410
Each day is worse than the last.

103
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,090
But since I've taken over
the original host's body,

104
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:55,270
I should take care
of her father in his old age.

105
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:58,120
Besides, he's nice to me, to be honest.

106
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,850
He saved my life.

107
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,610
That's a debt I have to repay.

108
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,190
I've called him Father for 18 years.

109
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,460
It's almost become real.

110
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:18,610
But really, I can't defeat
that big bad Sima Jiao.

111
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,070
Can you really do it?

112
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,630
I heard you have good skills
in cleaning up corpses,

113
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:36,200
so I came all the way to Winter City.

114
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,780
Don't worry, Mr. Xiu. You'll be satisfied.

115
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,410
Go on. Chop-chop.

116
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,665
 

117
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,030
Oh, dear Hong Luo,
you're usually so well-behaved.

118
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,120
But the one time you cause trouble,

119
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,500
you killed someone we can't afford to cross.

120
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,630
 

121
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,270
I didn't do it on purpose.

122
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:12,880
Besides, he was far too bold
to make advances on me.

123
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,200
So low in cultivation,
yet he dared to demand I join him.

124
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,030
Pathetic.

125
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,630
Killing someone isn't a problem,

126
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,750
but it's a serious problem
if you damage my reputation.

127
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,170
Madam.

128
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,150
I heard you're in trouble.

129
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,740
Look, I've brought you the solution.

130
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,720
This skinny brat?

131
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,620
Can she really handle it?

132
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,720
Tell me about it.

133
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,600
I think this deal is far too big

134
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,930
for your small appetite.

135
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,450
They're being ridiculous.

136
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,200
She may look skinny,

137
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,240
but she's skilled in cleaning up corpses.
 

138
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,000
I brought her here
all the way from Winter City.

139
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,570
Really?

140
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,260
Well, then. Go ahead.

141
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,630
This won't be easy to handle.

142
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,000
I knew you couldn't do it.

143
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,320
Not easy doesn't mean impossible.

144
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,020
It just takes effort to cleanly remove
Miss Hong Luo from this mess.

145
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,810
Can you truly do that?

146
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,210
Let's be frank, then.

147
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,410
Name your price.

148
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,880
18 demon stones.

149
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,630
18 demon stones?

150
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:43,810
That's too expensive.
Why not just rob me instead?

151
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,960
Well.

152
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:50,600
If you can handle Second Young Master's death,

153
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,150
here's my offer,

154
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:56,150
Rouge Terrace will reward you in the future.

155
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:59,690
But can you lower the price this time?

156
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,150
The lowest is 15.

157
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,360
Fine. 15 demon stones.

158
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,660
This must never leave this room.

159
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,030
What is this?

160
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,030
I'll begin now.

161
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:27,120
It'll appear as if the two men
fought Second Young Master to the death.

162
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,390
Nothing to do with Miss Hong Luo.

163
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,120
The process may be unpleasant.

164
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,380
Please step outside.

165
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,360
Let's leave.

166
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,030
Madam, let's go.

167
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,630
- Will this really work?
- Go.

168
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:42,140
- All right.
- I'll leave it to you.

169
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,510
Grandmaster, everywhere in the Demon Realm
is harsh and hostile.

170
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,750
Please endure it for now.

171
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,170
Let's rest here in Winter City.

172
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,450
 Yes! 

173
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,390
 I conjured this with the cultivation 

174
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,480
 you helped me improve. 

175
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,860
 Do you like it? 

176
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,810
 I helped raise your cultivation, 

177
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,390
 and this is what you use it for? 

178
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:38,140
 This will put a smile on your face,
isn't it worth it? 

179
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,390
Grandmaster, I believe

180
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:47,740
Ting Yan wouldn't want to see you upset.

181
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,020
 What were you drawing? 

182
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,630
 It's called an emoticon. 

183
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,690
 My secret code. 

184
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:35,930
 Cute, isn't it? 

185
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,690
Ting Yan...

186
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,860
She's not dead.

187
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,410
How is it, Grandmaster?

188
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,740
Why can't I sense her presence?

189
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,260
Could it be concealed?

190
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,210
Anyway, she's still alive.

191
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:38,390
We agreed on this. It's on you.

192
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,150
Yes, of course.

193
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,510
15 demon stones are a lot.

194
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:44,200
I couldn't have made this much
without your help.

195
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,550
True.

196
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,120
If the stingy madam found out

197
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,150
we pretended not to know each other

198
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:54,980
and raised the price together, she'd be livid.

199
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,020
Hong Luo.

200
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,430
You never used to kill.

201
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:07,050
What happened with that Second Young Master?

202
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,000
He killed my friend from Rouge Terrace.

203
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,080
At first, I only wanted
to drain his yang energy

204
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,720
to make him suffer.

205
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,510
Who knew he'd have the strength to strike back?

206
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,380
In a fit of rage, I...

207
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,000
I've already held back myself.

208
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,740
Don't be afraid. It's cleaned up now.

209
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,960
This place is full of filthy business.

210
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,750
Celestial Crane City may sound elegant,

211
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,780
but it's not a place to live for long.

212
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:46,320
Once I've saved enough,
I'll take you and my father to Grain Rain Vale.

213
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,450
We'll live free and comfortably there.

214
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,840
Grain Rain Vale?

215
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,720
That's a place that only appears in legend.

216
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,000
I've never heard of anyone going there.

217
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,050
I think that's just a tale to fool children.

218
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,660
You don't know.

219
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:08,550
I heard reliable news in the black market

220
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,200
that Grain Rain Vale is real.

221
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,270
It's just that it costs
a great price to get there.

222
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,150
2000 demon stones.

223
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,320
Right.

224
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,210
That's why you work so hard.

225
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,320
Didn't you say you're not Shi Yan

226
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,050
and you came from some other world?

227
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,880
I can't understand what you mean,

228
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,500
but your father isn't your real father.

229
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,050
Still, he raised me all these years.

230
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,210
Besides...

231
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,120
He did save my life.

232
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,630
 You carry the aura of the Celestial Palace. 

233
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,430
 Why don't you hand over your inner core 

234
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,530
 and let us drink with it? 

235
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,280
 Father. 

236
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,120
 Yan. 

237
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,600
 Run now. I'll hold them off. 

238
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,320
 No, I won't leave you. 

239
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,100
 Go! 

240
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,380
 Run! 

241
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,760
 Father. 

242
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,230
 You're frail. 

243
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,760
 Don't risk yourself for me again. 

244
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,080
 I've already lost Zhen Xu. 

245
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,630
 I can't lose you, too. 

246
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,930
 Father. 

247
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:44,660
His legs were crippled ever since.

248
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,880
I can't abandon him.

249
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,800
In that case, do this job well,

250
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,390
and I'll recommend you to Rouge Terrace?

251
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:59,600
You can work as a guard like Feng Qi.
What do you think?

252
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,630
You'll get demon stones every month.

253
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:04,300
Wouldn't that bring you closer to your goal?

254
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,390
It's so nice to have you.

255
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,450
Come on, we're friends.

256
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,680
When the madam found me,
my spirit sense was damaged.

257
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,360
I didn't know where I came from
or who my parents were.

258
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,390
But with a true friend like you, I'm happy.

259
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:24,950
If I don't support you, who will?

260
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,690
It's so good to have you.

261
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,930
Nian Jiu, how long have you been with me?

262
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,730
Nearly 400 years, I suppose.

263
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:44,300
It's time to be independent.

264
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,970
No time like the present.

265
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,970
This place may be small,

266
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,390
but it could be your beginning.

267
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:57,730
Grandmaster, I never have such thoughts.

268
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:02,250
I wish to stay at your side forever.

269
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,100
This isn't up to you.

270
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,990
 

271
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:13,760
Take Winter City.

272
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,100
I want to tell her I'm here in my way.

273
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,280
That way, we kill two birds with one stone.

274
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,840
We can find Ting Yan

275
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,670
and give the refugee
from the Celestial Palace shelter.

276
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,930
You're wise, Grandmaster.

277
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,190
This year, the Demon Lord
demands even more tribute.

278
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,080
His power is beyond everyone.

279
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,610
We can only obey.

280
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,320
 

281
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,860
What's happening outside?

282
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,990
This is bad, my lord!

283
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,670
Two strangers barged into the mansion

284
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,040
and defeated all our men.

285
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,820
Dozens of you defeated by just two?

286
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,600
Who's got the guts?

287
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,060
Take me to them.

288
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,470
Surrender the city,

289
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:18,040
and we will deal with the Demon Lord for you.

290
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,690
Release my men first, then I'll consider it.

291
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,900
Well? What have you decided?

292
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,421
Grandmaster, all the demon soldiers
have surrendered.

293
00:21:05,421 --> 00:21:07,280
Winter City has no leader now.

294
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,300
Please take charge.

295
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,380
You take the lead.

296
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,800
I'm open-minded.

297
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,120
Those who wish to stay,

298
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,950
from now on, we are as close as brothers.

299
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:38,820
For those who don't, you may leave now.

300
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,540
I won't leave.

301
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,360
I, Niu San, will follow the new city lord,

302
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,360
even at the cost of my life.

303
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,150
 We will follow the new city lord, 

304
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,470
 even at the cost of our lives. 

305
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,910
All right, that's enough.

306
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:05,230
You may leave.

307
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,250
 Yes, my lord. 

308
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,970
What's going on?

309
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,970
What's going on?

310
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:17,560
My lord, did they serve you poorly?

311
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,520
I'll fetch others to serve you.

312
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,380
That's not what I meant.

313
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,390
Niu San, you're kind of strange, though.

314
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,840
Tell me.

315
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,950
Why did you submit so easily?

316
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:34,360
My lord, the Demon Race admires the strong.

317
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,430
No matter who you are,
as long as you can fight,

318
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,380
you deserve to lead.

319
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:51,190
Young man, there's something
I've long meant to say.

320
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:54,120
We people here may be loose in manner,

321
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,280
but there are rules we must follow.

322
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,600
The city lord is here.

323
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,430
How can a sidekick act so arrogantly?

324
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,600
Shut it.

325
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,970
Niu San, are you out of your mind?

326
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,580
My Lord.

327
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,670
How would you want me to behave?

328
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:18,250
Grandmaster, don't tease me.

329
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,150
Greetings, Grandmaster.

330
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:29,670
Niu San, have you done the task I gave you?

331
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:32,660
- Hurry and get to it.
- I... I take my leave.

332
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:45,140
You truly carry such a presence
as the new city lord.

333
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,710
It's all thanks to you, Grandmaster.

334
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:49,840
Don't worry.

335
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,560
I've told those demonic cultivators

336
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,840
to deal with the Celestial Palace disciples
in the city.

337
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,670
Once word spreads that you claimed Winter City,

338
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,600
more Celestial Palace disciples
will come to join us.

339
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,710
When Ting Yan hears of it,
she'll come here at once.

340
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,930
Winter City is still a small place.

341
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,800
If we want to see her at once,

342
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,730
we must seize a few larger cities quickly.

343
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:37,280
It seems the cold energy in your body
hasn't recovered yet.

344
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,990
Father, the process of
restoring the cold constitution is painful.

345
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:44,280
Is there no other way?

346
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,950
To kill Sima Jiao,

347
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:49,660
you must use that cold energy
to form Extreme Cold Ice Spikes.

348
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:55,840
Since you can't master this technique,

349
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,760
I can only cleanse your marrow

350
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,120
to awaken your cold constitution.

351
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,490
Father!

352
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:26,760
Yan, I do this for your own good.

353
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,800
Don't blame me for being harsh.

354
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,230
We must kill Sima Jiao for revenge!

355
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:37,760
But Father, I don't hate him.

356
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,230
I can't share your hatred.

357
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,150
That's because you've lost your memories.

358
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:45,170
Why don't you restore them?

359
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,390
18 years ago, I lost my son,

360
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:53,150
and you lost your brother.

361
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,560
I didn't restore your memories

362
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,580
because I didn't wish you

363
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,690
to relive the pain.

364
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,630
But since I've already forgotten,

365
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,120
and we get to live on,

366
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,190
we should cherish the days ahead all the more.

367
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:13,730
What is there to cherish in such a ruined life?

368
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:19,760
Your brother died in the fire for your sake.

369
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,490
Do you mean to idle here in comfort?

370
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:29,450
Please calm down, Father.

371
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,340
I dare not forget his sacrifice.

372
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:42,470
I have word that Sima Jiao
entered the Demon Realm a few days ago.

373
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:46,100
He'll soon deliver himself to us.

374
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:51,250
Focus on tempering your cold constitution.

375
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,660
Sima Jiao is coming.

376
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:07,380
But I haven't saved enough
to go to Grain Rain Vale.

377
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,840
Is it wrong to simply live well?

378
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,360
You should only seek revenge
if you have the strength.

379
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,190
Sima Jiao must be a grotesque monster.

380
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:23,300
I'm just too weak to fight him.

381
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,320
 

382
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:57,690
Mother, I've come to see you.

383
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,660
I've taken a new name, Bi An.
 

384
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,950
Those who seek to exploit my Fengshan blood

385
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,930
won't be able to find me.

386
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:12,600
Mother, do you know?

387
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,150
They say Grandmaster
has arrived in the Demon Realm.

388
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:20,140
Tomorrow, I'll set out to find him and Ms. Yan.

389
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:23,730
Hopefully, the journey goes smoothly,

390
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:29,100
and they may be as kind as you said,

391
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,970
willing to accept me.

392
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:40,120
Mother, the Demon Realm is full of danger.

393
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,520
I can't linger here.

394
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,520
Once I find Ms. Yan and Grandmaster,

395
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,580
I'll return to see you.

396
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,270
 

397
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,310
Come.

398
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,990
- Drink it.
- Let me feed you, my lord.

399
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,030
Come, my lord.

400
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,600
Drink.

401
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,360
Come on, drink.

402
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,620
Come on, my lord.

403
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:15,270
- Nice one, my lord.
- Drink.

404
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:17,920
- Come on.
- One more cup.

405
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,210
Drink.

406
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,132
 

407
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,160
Why didn't you attend court again, my lord?

408
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,990
Why should I?

409
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,510
To be nagged by those old men

410
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:48,920
for splurging on building another palace,

411
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,250
or scolded for not personally leading battles?

412
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:02,250
Besides, Sima Jiao has already
fused two Spirit Fires.

413
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:05,950
Why seek trouble for ourselves?

414
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:11,120
My lord, I've found
an ancient secret artifact, the Xingtian Chain.

415
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,750
If we catch that Frost Fish,

416
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:15,390
refine her into a frost stone,
and set her into the chain,

417
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,390
it'll be enough to kill Sima Jiao...

418
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:19,580
Just hearing about this Frost Fish
makes me mad.

419
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:24,600
I've spent so much effort and power

420
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:30,120
just to turn a Frost Fish
with the extreme-cold nature into human form?

421
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,620
And now?

422
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:38,030
Do you even know if she's dead or alive?

423
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:40,230
- My lord...
- Ming Li.

424
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:43,810
You've served me for so long.

425
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,660
Don't you know me by now?

426
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,140
I have

427
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:58,080
neither the power of the former Demon Lord,

428
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,880
nor the ambition to restore the Demon Race.

429
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,880
I only wish to live comfortably
as a descendant of You,

430
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,580
and rot in the palace.

431
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:12,160
So, please.

432
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,180
Stop forcing me.

433
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,660
You Chi is such a fool!

434
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,730
Please calm down, Preceptor.

435
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:31,750
 

436
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:37,180
If the Demon Lord foils your plan,

437
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,270
 

438
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:40,400
We might as well...

439
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,660
No.

440
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,710
When the former lord You Yan's soul returns,

441
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:50,270
we need You Chi's body
as a vessel to house his soul.

442
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:53,490
Nothing must happen to You Chi.

443
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:57,030
I was being inconsiderate.

444
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:00,920
Our top priority is finding Liao Ting Yan.

445
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,190
Any news?

446
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:08,920
Our men have been searching
for those from the Celestial Palace.

447
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:14,800
Recently, faint traces
of the extreme-cold nature

448
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,140
were found in the southeast,

449
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:20,360
but it's too weak to confirm

450
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,230
if it belongs to the Frost Fish.

451
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:27,030
Isn't that near Celestial Crane City
and Winter City?

452
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:29,360
Dispatch men immediately.

453
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,230
Better to follow a false lead
than let her slip away.

454
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:32,580
Yes, Preceptor.

455
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,470
We've got a big gig today.

456
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:41,600
Old rules. We'll split.

457
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,380
- Do it well.
- The slow one...

458
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,490
Pays for drinks.

459
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,920
Grandmaster.

460
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,750
Grandmaster.

461
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,180
Grandmaster.

462
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,750
Grandmaster,

463
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,600
Winter City has ordered that
no one from the Celestial Palace be mistreated.

464
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,640
This man tried to abduct several of them.

465
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,860
I... I was only following orders.

466
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,950
Why are you taking people
from the Celestial Palace?

467
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:16,750
We were ordered to seize them

468
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,600
and take them back to the Demon Palace.

469
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,120
That's all I know.

470
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,950
Where were you searching?

471
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,600
We split forces

472
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,750
between Winter City and Celestial Crane City.

473
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:30,510
 Anyone from the Celestial Palace 

474
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:33,210
 could be Ting Yan. 

475
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,730
 I can't let her face the slightest risk. 

476
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,970
 There was a fierce fight here. 

477
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:28,470
 Once I gather 2,000 demon stones, 

478
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:29,680
 I'll take that stubborn old man 

479
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,400
 to Grain Rain Vale to live out his days. 

480
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,660
 Who knows, he might give up
forcing me to take revenge. 

481
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:54,290
Yes, gentlemen?

482
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,580
Attack!

483
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:06,110
Be careful.

484
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:09,280
Those from the Celestial Palace
must be taken alive.

485
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,730
I'm afraid you won't get your wish today.

486
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,700
Watch out!

487
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,810
Go away!

488
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,620
You won't escape today.

489
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,930
Thank you, sir.

490
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,307
 

491
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,236
 

492
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:28,700
Were you the one who saved me
in White Bone Abyss?

493
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,200
Follow me again, and I'll kill you.

494
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,550
Are you from the Celestial Palace?

495
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:56,060
May I ask about two people?

496
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:02,290
Do you know where Lord of Mercy
and his partner, Liao Ting Yan, are?

497
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,240
You're of the Fengshan bloodline?

498
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,430
You're Grandmaster?

499
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:15,330
You really are!

500
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:18,840
I'm Zhou Yue Qing, Zhou Qing Er's daughter.

501
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,890
Ms. Yan and you saved me before.

502
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,370
 Huan! 

503
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,140
Why are you in the Demon Realm?

504
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,990
When the Celestial Palace fell into chaos,

505
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:43,550
my mother and I fled here.

506
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:45,510
She passed away days ago.

507
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:49,840
I was left alone,
so I was looking for you and Ms. Yan.

508
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,470
I never dreamed I'd meet you here.

509
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:54,990
Please let me follow you.

510
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:56,550
I can do anything.

511
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:59,070
Mother said Ms. Yan loves to play.

512
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:02,060
I can keep her company while you're busy.

513
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:05,540
She does indeed.

514
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,880
With this protection shield,

515
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,950
no one will recognize you

516
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:27,430
as a Fengshan descendant again.

517
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,880
Go to the Winter City Lord.

518
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,430
He will help you settle down.

519
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:32,280
Thank you, Grandmaster.

520
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,770
What about you?

521
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:03,280
Grandmaster, we've claimed four cities.

522
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,030
Do we continue tomorrow?

523
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,630
Of course.

524
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:10,700
Celestial Crane City
is the hub of the southeast.

525
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,760
Understood.

526
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:17,680
Which means many from the Celestial Palace

527
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,920
may be hiding there.

528
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,590
I'll give orders immediately.

529
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:24,680
We'll move out tomorrow.

530
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,200
In full force.

531
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,470
Absolutely.

532
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:35,240
But, Grandmaster,
we've conquered so many cities.

533
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,920
Why haven't we heard news about Ting Yan?

534
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,990
Perhaps she got held up.

535
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:42,850
If she still doesn't appear,

536
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:46,620
I'll kick You Chi from his throne

537
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,370
and make the entire Demon Race search for her.

538
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,830
 

539
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,510
A demon dragon?

540
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,150
The City Lord is a demon dragon!

541
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:15,200
That's incredible!

542
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,370
I knew I followed the right person.

543
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:24,550
I've long heard the fame
of Winter City Lord and Lord of Mercy.

544
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:28,680
Since you rule the Demon Realm,

545
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:32,320
it has been peaceful and harmonious.

546
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,240
I, He Sou, City Lord of Celestial Crane City,

547
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,370
along with all demon soldiers,
pledge loyalty to you both.

548
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,580
Open the gate.

549
00:41:43,760 --> 00:42:00,360
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

550
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,620
Can't believe the leader
has such a pretty face.

551
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,040
 ♫ Autumn winds sigh ♫ 

552
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,160

 ♫ The laws of heaven ♫ 

572

 ♫ The vortex of reincarnation ♫ 

573
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:45,320
 ♫ What of life and death? ♫ 

574
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,120
 ♫ To save you ♫ 

575
