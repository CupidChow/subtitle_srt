1
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,580
500 years have passed.

2
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,650
It will all end soon.

3
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,390
Sima Jiao, a barrier in this mountain suppresses you.

4
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:39,700
The Eight Great Palaces sealed you here and took your place to rule the Immortal Mansion.

5
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,600
You are trapped with no way out.

6
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,470
How can you possibly change your fate?

7
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,120
Those hypocrites...

8
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,730
locked me in this lightless prison,

9
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,820
hoping I would yield.

10
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,600
But I have forged the Spirit Fire's avatar.

11
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,880
On the night of the new moon,

12
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,060
this mountain...

13
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,340
will no longer bind me.

14
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,480
Now,

15
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,520
I need only one last piece...

16
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,890
to turn the game around and change my fate.

17
20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,880
"In This World, I Only Love You" - TIA RAY

18
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,700
♫  Let the heavens release a mighty thunder tribulation  ♫

19
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,520
♫  Leading mountains and rivers so mighty and vast to shatter before my eyes  ♫

20
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,580
♫  Lifetimes of cultivation bring years of splendor   ♫

21
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,280
♫  Yet turn to dust between fingers in an instant  ♫

22
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,220
♫  When immortals and demons discern good and evil with a single thought  ♫

23
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,140
♫  Many souls escape into the endless wilderness  ♫

24
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,600
♫  I journey forward with the Spirit Fire in my veins  ♫

25
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,880
♫  I defy fate just to remain by your side  ♫

26
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,900
♫  Falling thousands of feet in love is like heavy rain  ♫

27
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,680
♫  Pouring down between heaven and earth  ♫

28
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,560
♫  Drunk in love  ♫

♫  Falling into an endless abyss of love  ♫

00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,950
♫  I'd still choose to be entangled with you  ♫

34

♫  Through all lifetimes  ♫

35
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,300
Is this heaven or hell?

36
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,270
Junior Sister Liao.

37
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,520
Master wants to see you in the Bamboo Grove.

38
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,860
"Junior Sister Liao"?

39
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,960
"Master"?

40
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,710
"Bamboo Grove"?

41
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,150
Do not worry, Junior Sister Liao.

42
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,430
You just joined us.

43
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,760
You trespassed on Three Saints Mountain

44
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,430
without knowing it was the Grandmaster's training ground.

45
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,650
Master will not blame you.

46
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:07,860
Now come with me.

47
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,380
Serene Vale... Serene Mountain...

48
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,980
Why do they sound so alike?

49
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:16,540
Mr. Wei of Sanshan Tech. liked your Serene Mountain proposal.

50
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:21,290
Go there tonight and visit him first thing tomorrow.

51
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,160
Junior Sister Liao?

52
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,580
Forget it. Talking more might make things worse.

53
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,350
I'll play along for now.

54
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,590
Is this the legendary cultivation world?

55
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,690
Master, I have brought Junior Sister Liao.

56
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:00,470
Good, Disciple Changqing. You may tend to your work.

57
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,130
Yes, Master. I take my leave.

58
00:05:04,486 --> 00:05:06,276
What about me?

59
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,910
Disciple Tingyan, why aren't you coming in?

60
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,120
Let me examine your Soul Manor.

61
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,450
So, I am in the body of someone named Liao Tingyan.

62
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,150
The barrier on Three Saints Mountain has indeed harmed your Soul Manor.

63
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,270
"Soul Manor"?

64
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,830
What's that?

65
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,920
It is the most hidden place within a person,

66
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,100
where mind, thought, and soul reside.

67
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,460
What is he talking about? I don't understand a word.

68
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,830
If the Soul Manor is damaged, one's mind grows clouded

69
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:48,250
and one's speech turns muddled, like yours now.

70
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,320
Since you have forgotten your past, I will tell you this.

71
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,220
This is Serene Vale, a minor branch of the Four Seasons Palace

72
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,250
under the Gengchen Immortal Mansion.

73
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,610
You have been my disciple here for over three months.

74
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:05,930
I have called you here because I will soon take you to the selection trial.

75
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,680
Seriously?

76
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,340
Even in the immortal world, people still have to hustle?

77
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,690
You forgot this, too?

78
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:16,780
In Gengchen Immortal Mansion, the highest elder, Lord of Mercy,

79
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,520
is about to end 500 years of secluded cultivation.

80
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,030
So, Sect Master Shi and the heads of the Eight Great Palaces

81
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,910
plan to send talented disciples into the mountain

82
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:30,110
to care for the Grandmaster in daily life and cultivate under his guidance.

83
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,640
You need not worry.

84
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:36,030
You are only there to make up the numbers.

85
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,320
So, I am just a filler?

86
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,320
Fine.

87
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,980
As long as I stay alive, anything is fine.

88
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,260
Slow down, Master!

89
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,660
Don't be afraid, Disciple.

90
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:10,350
Beneath us lies Gengchen Immortal Mansion, stretching 8,888 li.

91
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,680
It has stood for hundreds of thousands of years.

92
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,010
From the founding ancestor

93
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:19,000
to every ruler after, all have borne the surname Sima.

94
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,200
The current ruler of the Gengchen Immortal Mansion

95
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,770
is none other than the Lord of Mercy, who is to emerge from seclusion soon.

96
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:32,970
Sounds like this Grandmaster is the one with absolute authority here.

97
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,830
The Grandmaster is indeed the most respected.

98
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:40,330
The Gengchen Immortal Mansion's abundant spiritual energy exists because of him.

99
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:43,080
As for Sect Master Shi, he rules the Inner Court.

100
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:47,540
For generations, the Shi family has served and protected the Sima clan.

101
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:51,000
The Inner Court is divided into eight palaces,

102
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,150
and under them are minor branches like ours.

103
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:58,470
Master, if the Grandmaster is ending his seclusion,

104
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:01,660
why is he choosing people to go in instead of coming out himself?

105
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,520
I am not sure, either.

106
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,150
Perhaps he prefers peace and does not wish to leave the mountain.

107
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:41,730
This is the Fengqi Pavilion, where the Masters of the Eight Great Palaces

108
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,780
and Sect Master Shi meet to discuss important matters.

109
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,610
Isn't this an open audition?

110
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,980
I wonder what kind of disciples the Grandmaster likes.

111
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,110
The ones with talent and high cultivation, of course.

112
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,830
What will they perform?

113
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,510
Do not dwell on winning or losing.

114
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:01,660
Face it with a calm heart.

115
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:04,300
I am calm. Don't worry.

116
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,750
It is about time. You should go in now.

117
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,630
Let's wait a bit longer.

118
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:12,500
I am used to walking in right on time.

119
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,750
What is she doing, barging in like that?

120
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,690
Which palace is she from?

121
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,500
Sorry. Please continue.

122
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:34,300
Which branch are you from, Junior Sister?

123
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,630
Hello.

124
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:41,470
I'm from Serene Vale of the Four Seasons Palace.

125
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:45,300
I'm a disciple of Dongyang Zhenren.

126
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:52,100
So, you are not a junior sister, but a niece.

127
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,400
Oh, greetings, Senior Aunt.

128
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,560
You look several hundred years older than me.

129
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,460
Even if you call me your granddaughter, I wouldn't mind.

130
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,110
Quit flattering me.

131
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:06,990
For a low-level cultivator like you to join us in the selection...

132
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,830
Why do I feel a chill?

133
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:12,320
That's just laughable.

134
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,710
Am I right?

135
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:18,710
Exactly. She has no real skill, just a pretty face.

136
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:21,350
Thank you for the compliment.

137
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,080
What is she talking about?

138
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,020
- Yeah.
- How was that a compliment?

139
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,130
Greetings, Palace Masters and Sect Master Shi.

140
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,410
Today, the Palace Masters

141
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,870
will select 100 disciples from among you

142
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:55,590
to serve the Grandmaster in the mountain,

143
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,990
attend to his daily needs, and cultivate with him.

144
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,800
The selection begins now.

145
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,200
You need only sit in meditation, activate your heavenly crown,

146
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,870
and wait quietly.

147
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,830
- Understood.
- Understood.

148
00:11:19,683 --> 00:11:21,710
How do I activate my heavenly crown?

149
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:24,410
Do I just sit here?

150
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:06,320
Wasn't I just here to make up the numbers?

151
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,890
Who bought me a debut spot?

152
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,870
There must be a mistake. I wasn't even chosen.

153
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,910
How is that three-spiritual-root loser qualified?

154
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,680
I, the loser, would like to know that, too!

155
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,410
Mother...

156
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,710
Master!

157
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,710
Disciple Tingyan, I heard you were chosen.

158
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:42,920
I am truly pleased and honored as your master.

159
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,560
- Since Serene Vale's founding...
- Stop.

160
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,750
Didn't you say I was only there to make up the numbers?

161
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,440
How did I end up chosen?

162
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,460
Can you tell the higher-ups that I don't want to go?

163
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,510
Plenty would kill for this job offer.

164
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,230
What do you mean by "offer"?

165
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:58,580
In short, I am happy to give the spot to someone else.

166
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,160
But Serene Vale is only a minor branch within the Four Seasons Palace.

167
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,470
Being selected is such a great honor.

168
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,200
How could we refuse?

169
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,400
Besides, this decision was made jointly by Sect Master Shi

170
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,830
and the Masters of the Eight Great Palaces.

171
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,110
It cannot be changed.

172
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,750
Even in the cultivation world, people are forced to compete?

173
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,370
I just want to be a pretty good-for-nothing.

174
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,510
Besides, I know nothing about this place.

175
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,800
What if I offend the Grandmaster?

176
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,530
If he is displeased, I can't handle the consequences.

177
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,960
Don't worry.

178
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,710
Though I have never met the Lord of Mercy,

179
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:38,560
his title suggests a senior's leniency and kindness.

180
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,590
If you do not wish to serve him,

181
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:43,320
he is not likely to give you a hard time.

182
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,230
Three Saints Mountain is rich in spiritual energy.

183
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,870
Going there will surely improve your cultivation.

184
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:52,410
A promotion and a raise mean nothing to me.

185
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:55,960
I just want good food, good drink, and to quietly get by.

186
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,110
Congratulations, Junior Sister!

187
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,110
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations, Junior Sister Liao!

188
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,830
- Congratulations.
- You bring great honor to our branch.

189
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,870
This is our gift to you.

190
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:09,680
Why does it sound like everyone's counting on me?

191
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,470
Now I'm really stressed.

192
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,560
Don't be.

193
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,780
Enough. Step back.

194
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:18,870
Refrain from adding to her pressure.

195
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:25,130
Disciple Tingyan, your being selected has added honor to Serene Vale.

196
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:28,200
Given your low cultivation level

197
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,610
and your reluctance to serve the Grandmaster,

198
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:34,160
he will probably send you back before long.

199
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,690
So, there is no KPI?

200
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,940
What?

201
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,910
All right, then.

202
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:47,280
Well, I cannot return to reality anyway.

203
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:52,790
A temporary break from the daily grind might not be so bad.

204
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:18,000
So, this is Three Saints Mountain.

205
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:23,110
Why do I not see anything?

206
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,400
How could you, a mere three-spiritual-root

207
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,230
grasp the sanctity of the mountain?

208
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,440
Three saints once ascended here.

209
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,040
Since the Lord of Mercy entered seclusion,

210
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,680
it has been closed for 500 years, with no one entering.

211
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:43,380
Sounds like a hidden megadungeon in a game.

212
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,950
What's going on?

213
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:25,510
Grandmaster, please quell your anger.

214
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,560
Please quell your anger, Grandmaster!

215
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,470
Please quell your anger, Grandmaster.

216
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:34,070
When I step out, you will meet your ends.

217
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,180
Wait.

218
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,700
Are we sure this is a righteous grandmaster,

219
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,350
not one from the Demon Realm?

220
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:45,590
This Lord of Mercy doesn't sound merciful at all.

221
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,440
500 years have passed,

222
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,160
yet the Grandmaster has grown even more brutal.

223
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,680
What should we do?

224
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,800
If we cannot calm the Grandmaster,

225
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,870
Gengchen Immortal Mansion, a great sect for hundreds of thousands of years,

226
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:59,320
may end in our generation.

227
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,710
Grandmaster, I, Shi Qianlv,

228
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:09,350
have brought 100 disciples today to serve you in the mountain.

229
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,820
Enter.

230
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,030
Nisheng, you are the most outstanding of my disciples.

231
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:21,550
Heaven Palace is counting on you.

232
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,720
Understood, Master.

233
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,230
So, in the cultivation world, when the boss gets angry,

234
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,340
the employees start bleeding?

235
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,580
I should probably not go.

236
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,433
Hi.

237
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,010
Let's go.

238
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,580
I've lost something.

239
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,910
Where did it go?

240
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,890
What are you looking for? I will help you look.

241
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:58,110
You're too kind. I can find it myself.

242
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,770
Oh, my stomach... It hurts so much.

243
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,680
I'm going to faint.

244
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,830
Ow... My stomach...

245
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,970
Get up there first.

246
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,640
It hurts.

247
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,550
It really hurts.

248
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,310
All right.

249
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:28,250
I'm fine now. I can walk on my own.

250
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:50,980
This Grandmaster is living in such a vile place.

251
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,640
Is he practicing some kind of demonic art?

252
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,470
Senior Aunt, this place is frightening.

253
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,600
Should we really keep going?

254
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,770
Before we entered, Palace Master Tian told me there was a barrier in the mountain.

255
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:13,510
If you leave rashly, you will anger the Grandmaster

256
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,070
and be swallowed by the barrier.

257
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,900
If you're tired of living, go ahead and run.

258
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,350
A snake!

259
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,740
How terrifying!

260
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,450
Please wait, senior.

261
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:44,070
Senior, we disciples are here to greet the Grandmaster.

262
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:47,530
We are new here. Please guide us.

263
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,820
Come on.

264
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,630
They're actually following it? No way I'm doing this job.

265
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,740
How bold.

266
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:51,120
Those people are too brave.

267
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,400
They couldn't leave, so they followed a snake.

268
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,170
Good thing this world has no clock in system.

269
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:59,150
No one will notice I've skipped out.

270
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,040
What the...

271
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:18,790
Demonic energy? So, she's from the Demon Realm.

272
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:21,760
Who's there? I can see you.

273
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,970
Clueless fool.

274
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,580
This is too creepy. I am going back.

275
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,940
Let's go in.

276
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,870
In horror movies, the first to die is always the one alone.

277
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,240
I should stay with the group.

278
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,750
The tower is so tall.

279
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,450
But there isn't even an elevator?

280
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,760
- Blood!
- Blood!

281
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,140
What a bunch of fools.

282
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,270
Greetings, Grandmaster.

283
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:19,110
- Greetings, Grandmaster!
- Greetings, Grandmaster!

284
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,960
The Grandmaster's feet are incredibly well-cared-for.

285
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,920
So smooth and soft.

286
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,520
I wonder if his face is the same.

287
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:36,170
This centuries-old Grandmaster is actually a pretty boy?

288
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:09,280
You.

289
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,230
Why have you come here?

290
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:15,680
I wish to serve you, Grandmaster.

291
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:19,000
Liar.

292
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,360
How can someone so fair-skinned have such a bad temper?

293
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,560
He's like a landmine ready to explode.

294
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,220
Do not come near me.

295
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:57,090
You. What is your name?

296
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:00,840
I am Wan Ling. I worship you, Grandmaster,

297
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,980
and wish to serve you.

298
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,200
That wasn't Junior Sister Wan Ling. Who was she?

299
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,120
How dare she enter disguised as Wan Ling?

300
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,350
What did she want?

301
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:22,470
He seems to be looking at me.

302
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:25,680
Please, Grandmaster, just ignore me.

303
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,030
Here is someone even bolder.

304
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:30,550
How am I bold?

305
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:34,900
I have done nothing, Grandmaster.

306
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:40,210
Look at me.

307
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,620
Open your eyes and look at me.

308
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,240
You're still trying to play tricks?

309
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,950
I've done nothing, Grandmaster.

310
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,140
The Spirit Fire...

311
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,180
All of you, get out.

312
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,340
Out!

313
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,880
The Grandmaster seems to have lost his mind.

314
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,750
In fact, he's pure madness!

315
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:49,730
I suspect he let us in just to stock up on fresh meat

316
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,690
for his pet snake.

317
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,400
Nonsense.

318
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,600
The meeting with the Grandmaster is over for today.

319
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,290
We should find a place to rest and wait for his orders.

320
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,000
Let's go.

321
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,710
That Mu Nisheng from the Heaven Palace

322
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,580
acts like everyone has to obey her.

323
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,430
Well, I will not.

324
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,730
Let's go this way.

325
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,400
Looks like these palace schemers aren't impressed with me.

326
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,030
Good. The less I stand out, the better.

327
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:22,630
I just want to make it out alive.

328
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,750
We've walked for so long.

329
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:28,590
I think my feet are blistering.

330
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:41,030
Sima Jiao actually spared her in the hall.

331
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,560
What is so special about her?

332
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:51,360
I hope the Grandmaster does not hold regular meetings

333
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,310
and will not see me again.

334
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:55,170
My feet hurt.

335
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:00,680
Let me help you.

336
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,900
They stopped hurting.

337
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:11,960
Thank you.

338
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,200
I'm Liao Tingyan. What's your name?

339
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,960
I am Ye Ruling.

340
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,880
Ruling.

341
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,070
Why are you alone, too?

342
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,640
Are you, like me, from the "Doing Minimum Realm"?

343
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,480
"Doing Minimum Realm"?

344
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,510
Is she referring to the Demon Realm?

345
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:34,880
Which branch is the "Doing Minimum Realm"?

346
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,310
I just mean I do not want to serve the Grandmaster.

347
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:40,120
I am a disciple of the Yin Palace.

348
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,000
My palace master sent me here.

349
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,510
Why do you not want to serve the Grandmaster?

350
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:53,160
The entire Gengchen Immortal Mansion is sustained by his spiritual energy.

351
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,680
If you can gain his favor,

352
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,710
your cultivation will improve greatly.

353
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:01,790
In a short time, you could achieve a millennium of bitter training.

354
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:03,920
I have no such ambition.

355
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:07,860
I just want good food, good sleep, and to stay alive.

356
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,990
Then what is your plan?

357
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:14,550
I plan to find a sunny spot

358
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:17,270
where I can nap in the sun at midday and stay there.

359
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,990
Do you want to join me?

360
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,580
No.

361
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,600
But if you need help, you can come to the back hall to find me.

362
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,750
Goodbye.

363
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,540
Thank you.

364
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,080
Liao Tingyan.

365
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:53,360
Liao Tingyan has entered the mountain safely.

366
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,400
Well done, Young Master.

367
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,760
You must have put in quite some effort.

368
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,360
I placed a spell on her beforehand to make sure

369
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,400
she could gain spiritual energy

370
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,470
from Yue Chuhui without anyone noticing during the selection.

371
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:09,710
Good. Once she kills Sima Jiao,

372
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:12,680
the Immortal-Demon Barrier will vanish,

373
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,290
and we of the Demon Realm will no longer be trapped in this desolate place.

374
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:20,160
When that time comes, you had better keep your promise.

375
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,840
Rest assured. Once Sima Jiao is dead,

376
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,120
you will get what you want.

377
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,790
The disciples only entered today, yet a life lamp has already gone out.

378
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,990
With the Grandmaster's ruthlessness

379
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,120
and merciless nature,

380
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,750
I fear he will...

381
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,640
It is understandable that he would act that way.

382
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,920
500 years ago,

383
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:41,000
Sima Shi went mad and burned White Deer Cliff,

384
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,560
wiping out the entire Sima clan.

385
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:49,900
When the eight palace heads and I arrived, it was already too late.

386
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:56,020
Of that great clan, only Sima Jiao, who was still an infant, survived.

387
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,920
He happened to bear an extremely rare atavistic bloodline

388
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,160
and was already one with the Spirit Fire.

389
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:09,750
Thus, the duty of sustaining the Spirit Fire with flesh and blood

390
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:13,250
fell to him alone.

391
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,380
Such a bloodline carried supreme power...

392
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:22,050
but also brought endless torment.

393
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,680
From birth, he was destined to be the vessel of the Spirit Fire,

394
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,120
his soul and body in constant agony,

395
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,320
living a life worse than death.

396
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,120
To preserve that precious bloodline,

397
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,070
they placed seals and spells on him,

398
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:44,030
preventing him from suicide.

399
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:46,120
Sealed in Three Saints Mountain,

400
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,920
he has been imprisoned for 500 years.

401
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,790
When he was just an infant, his clan was wiped out,

402
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:54,740
and the Eight Great Palaces only sought to use him.

403
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,950
Of course, he went mad.

404
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,350
Grandmaster, please drink this bowl of soup.

405
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:04,700
One more sip.

406
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,750
The Grandmaster still shows some regard

407
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:10,240
for the Shi family for our past service,

408
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:14,470
but the disciples sent in by the Eight Great Palaces all harbor ill intentions.

409
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:17,470
I fear few will escape death.

410
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:19,400
Why?

411
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,900
Open your eyes and look at me.

412
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,360
Why did she make the Spirit Fire restless?

413
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,920
I've done nothing, Grandmaster.

414
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,730
What exactly is she plotting?

415
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:38,070
Could she be the one I need?

416
436
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:15,780

♫  The laws of Heaven  ♫

438
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,880
♫  The vortex of reincarnation  ♫

439
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,940
♫  What does life and death matter?  ♫

440
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,940
♫  To save you  ♫

441
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,900
♫  To save me  ♫

442
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:27,780
♫  To save all beings, I let the matter pass  ♫

♫  Be it right or wrong  ♫

444
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,900
♫  Rumor or legend  ♫

445
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:35,380
♫  With fate in my hands  ♫

446
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:39,120

♫  For the first rays of morning sun to shine through  ♫

456
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,900
♫  To face my promises  ♫

457
