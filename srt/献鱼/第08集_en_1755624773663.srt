Episode 15

5
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You miss love every day.

6
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
No wonder your people have no progress in cultivation.

7
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yes.

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm now able to coax the Shi clan.

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I can finally clear the fire.

10
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Since you have great cultivation,

11
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
can I also be a water-slinging sparring partner?

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Why did you apply the water-slinging sparring partner on your face?

13
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm making a mask.

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
When I had weak cultivation, the mask would easily fall off.

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Now that I have improved my cultivation,

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
the mask can also be put on my face.

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What's the use of this?

18
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It keeps the skin moist.

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It keeps the skin moist.

20
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It seems that my spiritual power is still enough to make up.

21
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Senior Brother said that this is to treat the injury of falling down.

22
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's not necessarily a correct answer.

23
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But it's definitely fine to use it as a bandage.

24
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
While the Shi clan is not awake, let's go out and play.

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I can't go out of Bai Lu Cliff, can I?

26
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's been 500 years.

27
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
This is the first time

28
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I've had a moment of sleep.

29
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Is it because of him?

30
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Is it because of him?

31
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
He has a headache again.

32
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It really hurts.

33
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's because his head hurts too much

34
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
that he doesn't care about the injury on his hand.

35
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Maybe compared to the injury on his hand,

36
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
the pain on his hand is nothing.

37
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's nothing.

38
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Father.

39
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I...

40
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
For the sake of your service,

41
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I can give you a vacation.

42
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Or do you want

43
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
to go to the temple to see the spirits?

44
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm not that kind of person.

45
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I want to see the spirits.

46
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Why?

47
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I can't wait to see them.

48
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I have to go to see them.

49
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Senior Brother,

50
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
what's up?

51
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Ning Yan, here.

52
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
This is the letter Ru Ling told me to bring you.

53
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You went to see Ru Ling behind my back.

54
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Did Ru Ling say anything?

55
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
and the beautiful scenery.

56
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,160
What about me?

57
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,120
Did Ru Ling ask me out?

58
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,440
I don't think so.

59
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,760
It said I can go alone.

60
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,160
It's almost 6 o'clock.

61
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,480
Am I leaving?

62
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,480
Snake, what's wrong?

63
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,840
Ting Yan.

64
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,800
Since Ru Ling gave me my snake heart,

65
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,000
I don't know why

66
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,240
I always...

67
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,280
I always miss Ru Ling's breath.

68
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,200
Ru Ling didn't do anything to your snake heart.

69
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,040
She always wears it

70
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,360
and at most, it's her scent.

71
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,120
Then why did I become a human?

72
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,320
I know.

73
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,280
It's your heart that fell in love with her breath.

74
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,000
That's why you became a human.

75
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,040
Then, Ting Yan, what should I do?

76
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,200
How can I make Ru Ling fall in love with me?

77
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,880
I don't know.

78
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,840
Snake, you just became a human.

79
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,680
You don't know

80
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,040
that the relationship between people

81
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,960
needs to be cultivated slowly.

82
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,800
Why don't you become a teacher in Ru Ling?

83
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,280
Then you can stay with your master

84
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,960
and be with him.

85
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,800
But I already have a master.

86
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,840
How can I become a teacher in Ru Ling?

87
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,560
My master will definitely disagree.

88
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,400
You're like a brother to him.

89
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,080
He won't say no to such a small thing.

90
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,240
I'm just a snake.

91
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,640
How can I be with my master?

92
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,440
Don't worry.

93
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,000
My master is just not good at expressing himself.

94
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,040
You're still very important to him.

95
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,600
I'm leaving.

96
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,320
I...

97
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,400
Master.

98
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,400
I wasuku Shrine

99
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,640
You asked Ting Yan away?

100
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,560
Yes.

101
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,080
What did she comes out for?

102
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:56,920
Master.

103
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,040
Ting Yan asked me to tell you

104
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,760
that she went to search for Ru Ling.

105
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,480
She learnt to منage something first and then leave.

106
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,200
Who reported to Ye Ru Ling?

107
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,040
A disciple.

108
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,160
What should you do?

109
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,440
I don't think he has any problem.

110
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,840
He should be fine.

111
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,200
But he has a son called Yuan Shang.

112
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,760
I don't know if he's his weakness.

113
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,400
What else?

114
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,440
I have a favor to ask.

115
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,560
I want to...

116
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,640
Go ahead.

117
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,880
I want to be a teacher in the forest.

118
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,640
I hope you can approve of it.

119
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,880
You think too highly of someone.

120
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,400
Don't get more annoyed at me

121
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,000
if you take this little thing on your own in the future.

122
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,960
Thank you, participated in the act of private role.

123
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,240
Thank you, agreed.

124
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,640
So it's just the right balance.

125
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,320
Not even a little difference between the balance and something,

126
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,040
This is the sky of wisdom?

127
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,440
It's so beautiful.

128
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,000
It's like the aurora.

129
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,320
The colorful light in the eyes of the common people

130
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,560
is a proof that I can't get away with it.

131
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,960
Mother,

132
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,720
are we really going to stay here forever?

133
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,480
After the battle of Xiemo,

134
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,640
we were enslaved by the Eagle King

135
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,680
from the son of the Demon King Fulu

136
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,440
to be punished.

137
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,520
I thought that the new princess

138
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,840
was a good person

139
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,680
and gave her to me.

140
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,920
I never thought that after you were born,

141
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,720
you would still live with me

142
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,240
in this dirty place.

143
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,880
Now,

144
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,520
the Sima Clan is left alone.

145
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,440
But if she suffers again,

146
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,400
the barrier between the Demon and the Sword will disappear.

147
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,080
We can return to the ancient map.

148
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,440
Mother,

149
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,240
is there no other way to return to the ancient map?

150
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,000
Are we going to our hometown?

151
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,800
The place of the cold.

152
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,560
It's said that the cold place of the Demon Kingdom

153
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,120
can also take us through the barrier.

154
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,080
In fact,

155
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,240
if we can cross the barrier

156
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,680
and go to the Demon Realm,

157
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,440
we can see the scene of the aurora.

158
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,160
It's more beautiful than now.

159
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,840
That's the best place to watch the view.

160
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,560
Can we go there?

161
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,480
Ting Yan, you...

162
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,880
Anshu Zhu Ling, be careful.

163
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,440
It's as painful as a book store.

164
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,320
You're still thinking about me at this time.

165
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,480
Ting Yan,

166
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,880
how did you get hurt by this barrier?

167
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,560
Didn't you say that

168
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,640
you have the special system of the cold?

169
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,120
Did you lose your mind?

170
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,560
No.

171
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,080
Why do you ask?

172
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,040
Nothing.

173
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,040
It's my fault. I forgot to remind you.

174
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,480
After the two wars between the Demon and the Sword,

175
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,440
the Sima clan set up this barrier with fire

176
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,320
to stop the two wars between the Demon and the Sword.

177
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,600
So,

178
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,480
no one from the Xian Mansion and the Demon Kingdom

179
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,040
can cross this barrier.

180
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,240
No wonder it's so powerful.

181
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,600
It hurts.

182
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,280
You're not hurt, are you?

183
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,680
Let me see.

184
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,680
Why does the cold body of Ting Yan

185
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,720
have no reaction to the barrier?

186
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:23,880
Father,

187
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,640
I found out that Yuan Shang has been

188
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,920
often acting in the area near Bai Lu Cliff.

189
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,720
Bai Lu Cliff?

190
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,280
What is he doing there?

191
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,000
He seems to be waiting for someone.

192
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,240
He dared to make a poem

193
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,440
under the eyes of Sima Jiao.

194
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,000
He thinks that his life is too long.

195
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,000
How about this?

196
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,120
If he can die in Bai Lu Cliff,

197
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,440
he can just give this matter

198
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,720
to Sima Jiao.

199
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,640
Xun,

200
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,720
you're really smart.

201
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,120
You're really something.

202
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,400
Keep watching.

203
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,840
Find a chance

204
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,320
to let Sima Jiao do it first,

205
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,880
and then we'll do it.

206
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,040
Okay.

207
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,200
What's so good about him?

208
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,640
Oh my god.

209
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,840
You Lan.

210
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,160
If he didn't do it last time,

211
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,600
there wouldn't be a case like this.

212
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,760
It's

213
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,360
right to be bad.

214
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,760
By McCaskill,

215
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,000
he should be grabbed by him.

216
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,360
He's still here.

217
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,920
Why bother to do it Tay guys,

218
00:12:49,920 --> 00:13:10,800
You even placed the

219
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,200
one

220
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,800
think

221
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,600
you

222
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,280
I'm sorry.

223
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,320
You really made me wait.

224
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,000
I finally sent a letter to you.

225
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,560
I contacted you twice.

226
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,680
But you didn't come.

227
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,400
You didn't even send me back

228
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,320
half a year's message.

229
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,520
It seems that you are really a high-ranking officer.

230
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,000
You're going to break up with me, right?

231
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,720
What kind of emotional speech is this?

232
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,200
It's like the man found out that the woman changed his mind.

233
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,080
He didn't answer the phone and didn't reply to the message.

234
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,720
Finally, after meeting, the woman knew that the man had complained.

235
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,280
She was going to fight.

236
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,040
What's wrong?

237
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,520
You dare not talk?

238
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,320
Si Ma Jiao may come to watch the show with me.

239
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,920
I have to be careful.

240
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,320
It's over between us.

241
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,320
Don't come to me again.

242
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,320
Good.

243
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,720
You really broke up.

244
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,600
But don't forget that

245
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,000
your life is still in my hands.

246
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,080
How is it?

247
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,000
Did you feel better

248
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,480
when you were poisoned by the stone bone yesterday?

249
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,520
I... I...

250
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,880
Why did you come again?

251
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,040
It hurts.

252
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,720
I was so jealous of you.

253
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,640
You are so hateful.

254
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,440
How can you have a girlfriend

255
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,720
with a strange drug-controlling man?

256
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,360
You are worse than that stupid Si Ma Jiao.

257
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,840
You are so arrogant.

258
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,800
Come on.

259
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,520
I will break up the love for you today.

260
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,040
You...

261
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,720
You dare to talk to me like this?

262
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,400
Aren't you afraid of death?

263
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,440
Okay.

264
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,880
I will help you.

265
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,440
What's going on?

266
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:20,960
Are you okay?

267
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,600
Did Si Ma Jiao

268
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,560
detoxify you?

269
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:27,960
Impossible.

270
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,400
If she detoxifies you,

271
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,400
she will know your identity.

272
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,760
She will kill you if she knows your identity.

273
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,240
What identity?

274
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,680
An innocent girl who was cheated by her ex-boyfriend?

275
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,000
Who is the ex-girlfriend?

276
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,280
You are still pretending to be confused with me.

277
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,800
You forgot the task I told you before?

278
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,160
Why didn't you kill her?

279
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,560
You don't want to kill me?

280
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,360
No.

281
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,880
Why don't you want to kill me?

282
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,560
Since it's so painful,

283
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,560
why don't you kill me?

284
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,640
I am already badly injured.

285
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,280
This is a good chance

286
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,560
for you.

287
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,160
Your cultivation has reached the化神机 stage.

288
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,400
So,

289
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,280
do you want to kill me?

290
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,400
No wonder.

291
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,880
It's not Si Ma Jiao who is suspicious.

292
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,880
It's the original owner of this body.

293
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,160
He really took the three holy mountains

294
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,240
with him to kill himself.

295
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,560
Since he knew it,

296
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,200
why didn't he kill me?

297
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,000
Si Ma Jiao is wise and wise.

298
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,920
He is broad-minded.

299
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,960
How could he be angry with me

300
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,960
for such a small thing?

301
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,280
Okay.

302
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,200
Si Ma Jiao doesn't care about your identity.

303
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,880
What about the others in the Chen's Mansion?

304
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,280
If the chief comes,

305
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,480
or other princesses find out your identity,

306
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,720
do you think Si Ma Jiao will protect you?

307
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,400
Are you threatening me?

308
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,200
What identity?

309
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,760
Don't talk nonsense.

310
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,560
I won't kill Si Ma Jiao because of you.

311
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,240
Wait.

312
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,080
I still have your soul.

313
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,800
Although I can't control you now,

314
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,120
as long as I have him...

315
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,880
I just thought about it.

316
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,320
Why did he come to me?

317
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,360
Go on.

318
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,800
What if he comes?

319
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,120
I'll kill you.

320
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,080
You can't even defeat Yuan Ying.

321
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,960
I did nothing.

322
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,200
I...

323
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,840
I'm so powerful?

324
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,160
You're just a little trainee.

325
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,640
Why are you so strong today?

326
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,720
I'm a god now.

327
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,120
A god?

328
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,040
A man is not a smart thing

329
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,240
to arrange such a spy.

330
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,320
Si Ma Jiao.

331
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,600
I've done so much for you.

332
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,600
Don't think that you can't reveal your identity

333
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,520
if you kill me.

334
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,240
Who's the first one to do it?

335
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,280
Can you stop acting?

336
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,520
I didn't want to kill you.

337
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,560
Stop.

338
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,600
You betrayed me

339
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,240
because you fell in love with Si Ma Jiao?

340
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,200
I'm not useless.

341
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,240
Don't talk nonsense.

342
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,040
What if Si Ma Jiao is listening to the wall?

343
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,880
What if I think I like him?

344
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,760
Ridiculous.

345
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,520
Even if you fall in love with him...

346
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,320
Shut up.

347
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,560
Don't talk nonsense.

348
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,280
You're so delusional every day.

349
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,640
You'll get sick easily.

350
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,360
I advise you to go to the hospital.

351
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,200
Just find a place to rest.

352
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,920
Don't think about the world.

353
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,480
You'll get sick easily.

354
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,080
That's all.

355
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:01,760
You...

356
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,360
Who are you?

357
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,560
I'm Yuan Shang.

358
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,040
You're the weakling of Yuan's family.

359
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,160
You came to the door yourself.

360
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,200
You're the weakling of Yuan's family.

361
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,480
That man said

362
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,360
the magic weapon can control me.

363
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,640
It's useless.

364
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,800
Senior, you're still sleeping?

365
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,840
I'm sleepy.

366
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,640
You're already a magical weapon.

367
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,880
Do you need to sleep?

368
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,040
There's no need to sleep.

369
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,760
I'm not sleepy.

370
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,640
I'm sleepy.

371
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,200
But I want to sleep.

372
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,360
It's like eating.

373
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,080
There's no need to eat.

374
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,200
But I want to eat.

375
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,760
You're so strange.

376
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,560
Did he

377
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,600
come with me just now?

378
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,880
Senior, you heard it?

379
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,960
Do you know who I am?

380
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,840
No one can hide anything from me.

381
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,000
But I don't know it myself.

382
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,960
Then what do you think

383
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,040
I am?

384
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,040
You're here to kill me.

385
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,000
Tell me if I should kill you.

386
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,720
If he wants to kill me, he should have done it long ago.

387
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,480
Besides, he killed me now.

388
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,120
Didn't he bleed so much yesterday?

389
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,480
He's not that boring, right?

390
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,360
What are you thinking about?

391
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,560
Your hand just rubbed the flower.

392
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,440
It didn't wash.

393
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,360
It just stuck to my mouth.

394
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,760
It just won't wash.

395
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,040
We've got about 70% left.

396
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,360
I can finish the task at one try.

397
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,000
Or we can just skip it today.

398
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,280
But this time,

399
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,640
you must take off the mask

400
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,120
and all the things on these lands.

401
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,200
Did you tell him to remove it first?

402
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,160
I haven't.

403
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,520
He has to take it to the orange tree.

404
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,440
When did you get it?

405
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,480
Didn't I managing your investment at that time.

406
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,520
It will always be yours.

407
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,560
You were the one who hit the ex-boyfriend.

408
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,480
What's an ex-boyfriend?

409
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,120
It's someone who shouldn't have appeared

410
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,840
and should be considered dead.

411
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,360
He deserves to die.

412
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,440
You're so nice to me.

413
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,640
You fed me blood and taught me how to be an ex-boyfriend.

414
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,520
He's nice to people,

415
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,720
but he's still being sneaky.

416
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,160
He's so arrogant.

417
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,160
Since you think he deserves to die,

418
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,840
you should follow his order

419
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,120
and kill him.

420
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,200
I just became a God of War.

421
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,320
I can't kill anyone

422
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,080
as you're so kind.

423
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,520
You'll get used to it if you kill more people.

424
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,080
Where are we going?

425
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,400
I'll take you to kill someone.

426
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,920
I'm not going.

427
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,080
Get up.

428
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,400
I don't want to kill anyone.

429
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,680
If I insist on killing someone,

430
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,920
then kill me first.

431
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,560
Do you really think I won't kill you?

432
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,720
I think you won't kill me.

433
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,120
Are you angry?

434
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,240
Grand Master.

435
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,680
Grand Master.

436
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,760
Grand Master.

437
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,960
Actually, this is not my home

438
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,360
and I'm not familiar with this place.

439
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,040
I often make some

440
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,800
murderous crimes.

441
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,280
Fortunately, you're here.

442
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,120
So I can be a good girl

443
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,960
in such a cruel place.

444
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,960
So my words are true.

445
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,360
The seven-name case is also true.

446
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,400
As long as you don't force me to kill,

447
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,480
everything will be fine.

448
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,320
Don't be angry, okay?

449
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,960
If you don't believe me,

450
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,080
try me.

451
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,080
Try me.

452
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:23,680
Shut up.

453
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,240
Okay.

454
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,760
Father.

455
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,400
You're the disciple of the sect, right?

456
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,080
Save me.

457
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,600
Father.

458
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,280
Is everything ready?

459
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,120
Yes.

460
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,280
Yuan Shang is dead.

461
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,200
Before his death,

462
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,240
Sima Jiao did a soul-searching technique to him.

463
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,080
There must be a trace of Sima Jiao's magic in the body.

464
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,880
We can call Yuan Shang weak.

465
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,480
He can't stand the torture.

466
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,800
He died with a fragile heart.

467
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,240
Then Sima Jiao

468
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,040
won't suspect us

469
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,800
and will also be the murderer.

470
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,680
Okay.

471
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,720
I told you to keep an eye on the young princess.

472
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,000
Why don't you know where she is now?

473
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,480
Please calm down, Your Highness.

474
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,960
I'll go to the young princess right away.

475
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,280
Who are you?

476
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,080
You're the personal guard of the teacher.

477
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,200
I wonder what you're doing here at night.

478
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,240
o

479
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,080
He who wanted to save Her Highness

480
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,360
didn't allow his sister to show up.

481
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,120
To me

482
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,120
He's only a slave who has night sheriffs' functions.

483
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,760
I'll show you around.

484
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,760
Check it out yourself.

485
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,360
I'm not afraid of you.

486
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:35,840
You...

487
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,520
You're not hungry.

488
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,040
You dare not let me go?

489
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,920
Your brain

490
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,680
is more stupid than my tongue.

491
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,880
If you weren't a teacher,

492
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,360
you wouldn't be alive today.

493
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,640
This is a bad omen.

494
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,480
Did the family kill me?

495
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,520
What do you think?

496
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,400
When you were searching for the soul for me,

497
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,240
you left me a spell.

498
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,160
It turned out to save me.

499
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:00,680
Useless.

500
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,840
Wasted my spiritual power.

501
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,800
You already know

502
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,480
I was the one who colluded with Mo Yu

503
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,400
and sent Liu Ting Yan to you

504
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,120
to find a chance to kill you.

505
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,600
Why did you save me?

506
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,720
What's your purpose?

507
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,600
And

508
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:16,920
why did

509
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,240
the teacher kill me?

510
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,160
How did Yuan Che give birth to such a stupid son?

511
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,400
You can scold me,

512
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,920
but you can't insult my father.

513
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,640
Wasted my76 a little 아니라

514
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,560
Guo Zi

515
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,640
Take her to find Yuan Che.

516
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,840
If she's Geez News heavy,

517
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,520
just let her son live.

518
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,360
Or

519
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,800
let's go and kill her.

520
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,880
Wasted Germs

521
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,520
Shang'er.

522
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,560
The teacher

523
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,400
UNE OVER Kevin

524
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,320
did this to my son

525
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,160
and even tried to frame my master.

526
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,280
It's not a good idea.

527
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,640
Thank you for your kindness.

528
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,960
I wonder how you will deal with Shi Qianlv.

529
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,600
You don't need to know what I'm doing.

530
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
You just need to do what I tell you.

531
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:12,880
Okay.

532
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,400
I'll be your guard in the future.

533
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,680
I don't know what you did to Yuan Shang.

534
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,640
I want you to follow Shi Qianlv

535
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,560
to gain his trust.

536
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:24,880
Okay.

537
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,120
I'll be your spy.

538
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,680
I'll send you the message when I know something.

539
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,720
Master said

540
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,320
you don't need to contact him.

541
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,360
You just need to do what Shi Qianlv wants.

542
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:36,960
Remember,

543
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,600
you must gain his trust

544
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,640
so that you can use him in the future.

545
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,120
As for Yuan Shang,

546
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,720
you can forgive him.

547
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,480
But he can't see anyone since then.

548
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,040
If you can't hide him,

549
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,200
he'll kill him for you

550
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,080
to solve the problem.

551
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,960
I'll follow your instructions.

552
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,240
Thank you for saving my son.

553
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,520
Shang.

554
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,120
Shang.

555
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,720
Sister.

556
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,200
Cang Lan.

557
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,160
You're finally back.

558
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,040
It's good that you're back.

559
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,320
You suffered.

560
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,240
I'm not suffering.

561
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,720
Congratulations on taking the princess' heart.

562
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,560
Now you can live here.

563
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,920
You don't need to be forced anymore.

564
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,640
Come on.

565
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,040
Sister.

566
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,120
When you were in the mountain,

567
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,800
didn't you find a chance to kill Sima Jiao?

568
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,640
Sima Jiao is too powerful

569
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,400
and very cautious.

570
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,880
He only asked Ting Yan to serve him.

571
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,640
I couldn't get close to him.

572
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:12,840
But Cang Lan,

573
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,280
I found that

574
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,600
Ting Yan might be the body of the cold that Mother mentioned.

575
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,200
The body of the cold?

576
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,760
Only the cold fish of the Demon Citadel can have the body of the cold.

577
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,000
Is Ting Yan the body of the cold fish?

578
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,120
Great.

579
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,560
The barrier set by the fire

580
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,560
can only be passed by the body of the cold

581
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,240
if Sima Jiao is eliminated.

582
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,880
But I tried.

583
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,400
He seems to have forgotten his identity

584
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,080
and doesn't remember how to transfer the body of the cold.

585
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,040
Then we can just take his internal energy.

586
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,040
How can we do that?

587
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,040
He won't live if we take his internal energy.

588
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,600
Ting Yan doesn't know his identity.

589
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:47,680
Cang Lan,

590
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,120
we can't ask others to sacrifice themselves

591
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,200
to help us.

592
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,160
If he is found to be a person of the Demon Citadel,

593
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,800
he will die in the Immortal Manor.

594
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,680
It's better to ask him to help us

595
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,480
to return to the Demon Citadel with our fellow demons

596
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,920
and complete Mother's last wish.

597
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,040
No.

598
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,080
Ting Yan is sincere to me.

599
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,560
I can't be suspicious of him.

600
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,320
As long as Ting Yan is alive,

601
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,720
we still have hope for our plan to go home.

602
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,880
But, Cang Lan,

603
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,560
it's easier to take Ting Yan's internal energy

604
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,920
than to kill Sima Jiao.

605
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,440
Enough.

606
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,280
Don't worry about it.

607
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,640
I will find a way.

608
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,880
Good.

609
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,480
Tell Yuan Che

610
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,360
that you sent the news

611
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,960
that Liao Ting Yan is a person of the Demon Citadel.

612
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,520
Then he will think

613
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,560
that Sima Jiao heard the story

614
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,400
of the ancient cave of the person of the Demon Citadel

615
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,680
and killed his son.

616
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,080
In this way,

617
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,760
Sima Jiao will be convinced.

618
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,360
Yes.

619
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,160
An Xue,

620
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,640
you will be able to complete

621
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,960
the task of the Three God Mountains

622
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,120
in the future.

623
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,480
You have done it very well.

624
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,960
What kind of reward do you want?

625
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,680
Now that Ying Liu Nian is dead,

626
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,240
the new princess is not in good health.

627
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,480
An Xue only wants to go back to the sect leader.

628
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,680
There is nothing else I can ask for.

629
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:05,960
Good.

630
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,760
Thank you, sect leader.

631
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,360
You may leave.

632
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,560
Yes.

633
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,160
Zhen Xu,

634
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,840
when are you going to

635
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,640
show An Xue

636
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,360
the magic of soul-willing?

637
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:35,680
Father,

638
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,720
the magic of soul-willing is very painful.

639
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,720
An Xue doesn't know our great plan

640
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,840
and is always loyal to us.

641
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,400
Look at the magic of soul-willing.

642
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,320
Zhen Xu,

643
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,720
you have to remember

644
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,680
that in this world,

645
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,400
except me,

646
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,480
no one can be loyal.

647
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,640
In our great plan,

648
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,200
there must be no flaws.

649
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:00,840
I understand.

650
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,080
Where is Liao Ting Yan?

651
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,720
Ting Yan is still sleeping.

652
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,600
She is awake

653
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,960
and eating and sleeping all day.

654
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,040
I will wake her up.

655
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:13,920
Do as you wish.

656
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,480
Liao Ting Yan's evil identity

657
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,200
has been found out by the teacher.

658
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,280
Patriarch,

659
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,600
Shi Qian Lv actually found

660
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,920
Ting Yan's evil identity.

661
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,960
What should we do?

662
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,320
This is a secret.

663
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,280
How did the old man know?

664
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,720
Did Shi Qian Lv have collusion with the evil?

665
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,760
That's why he knew Ting Yan's identity.

666
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:35,880
Go and find out

667
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,400
where the news came from.

668
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,080
Yes.

669
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:39,800
But Patriarch,

670
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,680
how should we deal with Ting Yan?

671
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,320
Since Bada wants her dead,

672
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,600
we will do as they say.

673
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,560
Patriarch,

674
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,960
are you going to kill Ting Yan?

675
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,600
What's wrong?

676
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,640
You can't bear to?

677
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,480
I can't bear to.

678
00:33:59,160 --> 00:33:59,920
I believe

679
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,840
you can't bear to either.

680
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,080
I will ask Yuan Che

681
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,320
to find Shi Qian Lv's alliance

682
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,360
and kill Liao Ting Yan

683
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,280
to gain Shi Qian Lv's trust.

684
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,520
Patriarch.

685
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,280
Patriarch.

686
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,760
Patriarch.

687
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:16,840
Patriarch.

688
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,480
Princess Yuan.

689
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,120
Please

690
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,400
help me to make the decision.

691
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,960
What's wrong with you, Princess Yuan?

692
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:22,760
Today,

693
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,480
I found

694
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,640
Shang Er's body under the White Deer Cliff.

695
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,520
There is a silk rubber

696
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,640
on her body.

697
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,760
How could this happen?

698
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,280
Princess Yuan,

699
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,320
I'm sorry.

700
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,440
But

701
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,040
why would the Patriarch

702
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,400
do that?

703
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,000
I just found out.

704
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,640
Liao Ting Yan

705
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,360
is a spy of the Demon Citadel.

706
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,240
I'm afraid my son knows about this.

707
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,200
He wants to kill someone

708
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,000
and he will mobilize the silk rubber

709
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,520
to kill my son.

710
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,520
Now,

711
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,440
the Patriarch is so fond of

712
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,480
the Demon Citadel.

713
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,760
If this continues,

714
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,040
the Gangchen's Mansion

715
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,880
will be in danger.

716
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,680
I will never

717
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,600
let him do this.

718
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:09,960
I was

719
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,840
a little bit respectful of him before.

720
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:12,760
I didn't expect

721
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,480
he would take our lives

722
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,920
so lightly.

723
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,440
He is a good man

724
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,320
and he is not a thief.

725
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,680
I must avenge him.

726
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,920
Patriarch,

727
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,920
you are here.

728
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,040
You are reading too.

729
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,880
Since I entered the Magic Realm,

730
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,680
I have a strong sense of the world around me.

731
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,040
I'm also curious about

732
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,480
the structure of the world around me.

733
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,720
I'm bored,

734
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,680
so I'm here to see

735
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,920
if there are any good books.

736
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,240
What did you read?

737
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,360
I read...

738
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,920
I just read whatever I want.

739
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:16,880
Read it.

740
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,120
Let it go.

741
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,760
Can you promise me

742
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,320
not to get angry if I read it?

743
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,120
No.

744
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,560
Look.

745
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,640
I knew you would be angry.

746
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,120
It's just that those people from the Immortal Gengchen's Mansion

747
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,920
came out.

748
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,400
Master, please tell me the truth.

749
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,720
It says that

750
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,800
the Immortal Gengchen's Mansion

751
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,680
is not only where we see now.

752
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,040
There are some outside families around it.

753
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,400
Except for the place where the cultivators live,

754
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,960
there are also places where the demons live.

755
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,000
Is it true?

756
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,400
It's true.

757
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,720
Many years ago,

758
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,880
the owner of the Demon Citadel was in chaos.

759
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,680
The Sima clan killed the demons.

760
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,360
They set up the Demon Citadel.

761
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,480
Since then,

762
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,600
the people who were possessed

763
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,040
could no longer use the spirit weapons of the Gengchen's Mansion

764
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,760
to cultivate.

765
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,040
The Sima clan is so powerful.

766
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,400
It is said that the battle

767
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,760
was a perfect match.

768
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,520
The battlefield became a thousand miles away.

769
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,640
The original Qiu Ling Mountain

770
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,200
also became a minefield.

771
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,160
It also said that

772
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,960
you were raised by the Taoist Army.

773
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,880
It said that you were arrogant and didn't listen to it.

774
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,840
So it found a immortal

775
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,040
to suppress the demons for you.

776
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,680
It said that the name of your Taoist Army

777
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,440
is...

778
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,400
It's so fake.

779
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,360
Let me tell you.

780
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,120
This book is nonsense.

781
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,160
Boss,

782
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,680
this book is too much.

783
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,280
I don't believe it.

784
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,200
I'm not lying.

785
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,200
Master Shi.

786
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,200
Please restart the seal formation.

787
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,480
I will be the leader of the Taoist Sect

788
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,520
and guard the formation.

789
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,720
Princess Yuan is too serious.

790
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,160
Master Shi is so stubborn.

791
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,400
We should

792
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,240
persuade him

793
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,520
to take the right path.

794
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,120
Now,

795
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,600
the new princess of the Heavenly Palace has been appointed.

796
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,600
It seems that

797
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,800
it's not a problem

798
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,240
for us to re-seal her.

799
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,440
However,

800
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,680
Princess Yuan,

801
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,520
you are right.

802
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,640
Once we restart the seal formation,

803
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,120
we will have a dead man.

804
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,640
What...

805
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,640
What should we do?

806
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,920
You suggested that Liao Tingye's demon identity

807
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,080
be sealed by the seal.

808
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,000
It must be a good thing.

809
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,520
Since Sima Jiao

810
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,440
favors the demon and the spy so much,

811
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,960
we should use her

812
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,120
to lure Sima Jiao into the formation.

813
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,600
Even if we fail to seal her,

814
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,360
we can capture Liao Tingye

815
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,480
and control her in the future.

816
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,200
At the banquet a few days ago,

817
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,320
I think she seems to have a lot of feelings

818
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,840
for Master Shi.

819
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,080
We can also take advantage of it.

820
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:20,880
Princess Yuan,

821
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,480
this is a good opportunity.

822
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,320
Okay.

823
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,560
It's not too late.

824
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,400
I will call

825
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,280
all the princesses

826
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,520
to discuss this matter together.

827
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,360
Thank you, Master Shi.

828
00:39:42,660 --> 00:40:04,700
Attic of The Great Ning

829
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,800
policy wasze to the priest's aunt,

830
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,440
No.

831
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,080
No.

832
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,840
Can I go there by myself?

833
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,640
Of course.

834
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,000
This is a party

835
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,400
for you.

836
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,040
To kill you.

837
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,620
Go.

838
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,800
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

839
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,800
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

840
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,800
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

841
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,800
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

842
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,800
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,800
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

849
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,800
