 "In This World, I Only Love You - Tia Ray 

3
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,700
♫  Let the heavens release a mighty thunder tribulation  ♫

4
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,420
♫  Leading mountains and rivers so mighty and vast to shatter before my eyes  ♫

5
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,780
♫  Lifetimes of cultivation bring years of splendor   ♫

6
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,340
♫  Yet turn to dust between fingers in an instant  ♫

7
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,220
♫  When immortals and demons discern good and evil with a single thought  ♫

8
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,240
♫  Many souls escape into the endless wilderness  ♫

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,700
♫  I journey forward with the Spirit Fire in my veins  ♫

10
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,880
♫  I defy fate just to remain by your side  ♫

00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,900
♫  Falling thousands of feet in love is like heavy rain,   ♫

♫  Falling into an endless abyss of love,   ♫

♫  Stirring waves upending a lifetime  ♫

00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:27,020

19
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,125
♫  Through all lifetimes  ♫

20
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:36,540
   

21
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,910
   

22
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,110
Look at us now.

23
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,750
Do we still look like we are in charge
of the Celestial Palace?

24
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:48,060
We are nothing more than puppets
to keep the Eight Palaces' glory alive.

25
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,550
People's greed has pushed us
to the brink of despair.

26
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:56,030
Today, Sima Shi and Sima E
are joined as partners

27
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,330
to continue the bloodline of Fengshan

28
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,030
and nourish the Spirit Fire!

29
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,990
- There...
- E, give our child a name.

30
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,100
Let's call him Jiao.

31
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,710
 This baby is actually the Grandmaster? 

32
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:21,450
 So, these two are the Grandmaster's parents? 

33
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:37,642
 What happened? 

34
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,610
It's useless.

35
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,420
They clearly mean to trap the Sima clan here.

36
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,040
The late Great Ancestress
needs to be buried outside the mountain.

37
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,960
Why have you sealed White Deer Cliff?

38
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,701
 We will have people escort the Great Ancestress 

39
00:02:54,701 --> 00:02:56,110
 out of the mountain for burial later. 

40
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,460
 The Sima clan must remain here
to guard the Spirit Fire. 

41
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,590
 Grandmaster, please stay on White Deer Cliff. 

42
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,920
 The Eight Palaces aren't even
trying to hide their intentions. 

43
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,430
You are treating us like prisoners!

44
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,070
Do you even have the slightest respect
for us Grandmasters?

45
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,670
 The array is a joint seal by the Eight Palaces. 

46
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,320
 It allows entry but no exit. 

47
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,660
 Please do not waste your efforts
trying to break it. 

48
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,960
 So, even the generation before the Grandmaster 

49
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,320
 could not escape the fate
of being trapped by the Eight Palaces. 

50
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,710
Grandmaster, Grandmistress!

51
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,390
Weren't you supposed to escort
the Great Ancestress's body outside the array?

52
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,320
Why have you returned so soon?

53
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,930
Yesterday, the eight palace heads opened a gap in the sealing array

54
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,830
so I could send the Great Ancestress's body
outside the cliff for burial.

55
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,740
- But then...
- Go on.

56
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,420
But then, those people from the Eight Palaces

57
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:56,550
used her body for a feast.

58
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,110
What a bunch of monsters!

59
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,470
Has the Grandmaster's father gone mad?

60
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,470
Is he trying to burn down White Deer Cliff?

61
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,470
What's going on?

62
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,000
- Sima Shi, what are you doing?
- What's going on?

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,350
- Sima Shi, what are you doing?
- Have you lost your mind?

64
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,760
- What are you doing?
- Yeah.

65
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,520
What happened?

66
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,860
He's dead.

67
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,730
Now, only Sima E and her son can sustain the Spirit Fire.

68
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,300
We cannot let them die as well.

69
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:53,960
 ♫ Every pair of deep,
dark eyes is full of falsehood ♫ 

70
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:59,290
 ♫ Loneliness stretches on without end ♫ 

71
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,180
No!

72
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,660
 We must make Jiao merge
with the Spirit Fire as soon as possible. 

73
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,960
 That way, the Eight Palaces
will not dare harm him. 

74
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,030
 But if he merges with the Spirit Fire, 

75
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:14,680
 he will live forever
in the agony of its burning. 

76
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,360
 I don't want him to live such a life. 

77
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,420
 Better to end the Fengshan Clan's
generations of tragedy here. 

78
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:24,080
 E, Jiao was born with this mission. 

79
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,910
 He carries the rare atavistic
Fengshan bloodline. 

80
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,760
 He's both pure and powerful. 

81
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,810
 He is our clan's hope for revival. 

82
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,640
Do you know the price of absorbing
the Fengshan Spirit Fire?

83
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,030
If you fail, both you and your son will die,

84
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,520
and the Sima clan will be wiped out completely.

85
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,660
I have no other choice.

86
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,320
Today, I offer my flesh,
blood, and spirit bones.

87
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,910
Will you merge with my boy through my nirvana?

88
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:00,020
The last thing I wish to take is your life.

89
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,610
But fine, I have grown tired
of this world anyway.

90
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:11,750
 ♫ If I could become a mortal being ♫ 

91
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,660
 ♫ Forget the grudges of past lives,
and feel neither joy nor sorrow ♫ 

92
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,920
 ♫ I'd bear no resentment or regret ♫ 

93
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:25,470
 ♫ Let my mortal heart fall to the human world ♫ 

94
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:32,740
 ♫ I'll trade it for a lone, fearless self
and let the past drift away ♫ 

95
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:39,780
 ♫ With every regret I once held onto ♫ 

96
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:46,430
 ♫ I'll survive countless trials

97
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:52,210
 ♫ Let my mortal heart sink into the sea ♫ 

98
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:58,940
 ♫ I dream of a weightless self,
soaring to the heavens ♫ 

99
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,350
 ♫ Neither alive nor gone,
I'm bound only by endless loneliness ♫ 

100
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:06,470
 ♫ Watching the world change... ♫ 

101
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,120
From now on,

102
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,220
you will be the only living person
to carry the bloodline of the Sima clan.

103
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,760
Have I been buried?

104
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,000
Who buried me?

105
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,490
Grandmaster, Mr. Snake, little flame! Help!

106
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,570
Open...

107
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,890
You seem really scared.

108
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,270
Why did you put me in a coffin?

109
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:13,030
You chose a poisonous flower.

110
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:18,130
Then you fell unconscious
for three days and were beyond saving,

111
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,660
so I decided to give you a proper burial.

112
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,230
Relax.

113
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:30,000
I just put you in the coffin to scare you.

114
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,100
I've already neutralized the poison.

115
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:36,450
So, I really picked a poisonous flower?

116
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:41,040
Didn't you say only evil people
produce poisonous flowers?

117
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:47,130
 But Sima E, Sima Jiao's mother,
looked so kind-hearted. 

118
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:51,880
No one is purely good or purely evil.

119
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,240
How can a single flower decide that?

120
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,840
Then why was that flower poisonous?

121
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:07,890
If one dies with a calm and content heart,
their bone pearl produces a healing flower.

122
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,380
If one dies in pain and resentment, their flower is poisonous.

123
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,890
No wonder...

124
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:28,510
Judging by your tone, you saw who this flower came from, didn't you?

125
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,560
 He doesn't know the flower I picked 

126
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,410
 was grown from his mother's bone pearl. 

127
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,290
 Should I tell him? 

128
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,680
 Forget it. He's in a good mood now. 

129
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,590
 I shouldn't reopen old wounds. 

130
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,990
 The Grandmaster's family had actually 

131
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,300
 been jointly imprisoned by the Eight Palaces. 

132
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,280
 Because of that,
all of his clan perished in flames. 

133
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,770
 No wonder he wants revenge. 

134
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,510
But isn't the poison incurable?

135
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,200
How did I survive?

136
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,410
Some of the flowers
work as antidotes, remember?

137
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,870
So, they don't contradict each other.

138
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,100
They cancel each other out.

139
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,370
Then how do you tell medicine from poison?

140
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,110
I'm from the Sima clan.

141
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,280
The poison has no effect on me.

142
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,110
Besides, the Spirit Fire
can help me tell them apart.

143
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:27,510
Don't tell me you went so far
as to use the Spirit Fire just to save me.

144
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,750
I didn't need the Spirit Fire for that.

145
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,890
I just needed to tell sweet from bitter.

146
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,180
 Poison, again. 

147
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:59,600
So, you tasted the flowers to find medicine for me,

148
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,200
just like Shennong did? 
  (Deity of agriculture and medicine) 

149
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,730
If I want to kill you, no matter where you are, you'll die.

150
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,634
If I don't want to kill you,

151
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:17,470
even if you're dead,

152
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,700
I can bring you back to life.

153
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:25,310
Very mighty of you.

154
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,580
By the way, boss,

155
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:32,890
during the three days I was unconscious, did anyone come looking for me?

156
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,340
Who do you want to have come?

157
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,110
So, no one then.

158
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:42,470
This feels just like getting off a plane and finding no new messages at all.

159
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,020
What?

160
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,940
Nothing.

161
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,230
Grandmaster, look.

162
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:54,270
Since you've already ended seclusion, keeping me around serves no purpose.

163
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,610
I'm just eating and living for free.

164
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:59,380
Why don't I go back to Serene Vale?

165
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,540
Is Serene Vale better than here?

166
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:15,350
 If I say yes, he'll get mad again. 

167
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:18,630
 He just played Shennong for me. 

168
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:22,200
 It seems he sees me as a trusted aide now. 

169
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,800
 No way he'll let me leave anytime soon. 

170
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,410
If you say yes, I will kill you.

171
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,910
No, of course not.

172
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,610
May I take some leave then?

173
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:37,160
I want to go see Ruling.

174
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,730
You can't.

175
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:42,080
You don't even know her true identity.

176
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,130
 Forget it. 

177
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,700
 I'll just wait for a chance to sneak out with Brother Snake and see Ruling. 

178
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,160
Grandmaster, the Immortal Mansion is still keeping up the old practice of death duels.

179
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,830
Today's match is about to begin.

180
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:56,040
The Eight Palaces' most valued disciples have already arrived at the arena.

181
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,970
Sect Master Shi and the eight palace masters will probably be there, too.

182
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:06,520
Grandmaster, There's something I'd like to ask.

183
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,870
The Eight Palaces have made you suffer for 500 years.

184
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:14,230
Why didn't you kill them all when you emerged from seclusion?

185
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,890
What if they join forces again to seal you?

186
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,090
If I kill them all,

187
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,630
who will deal with the mess in Gengchen Immortal Mansion?

188
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,100
Me?

189
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,960
You could support a new palace master loyal to you

190
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,120
to run the Immortal Mansion.

191
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:34,300
Everyone is greedy.

192
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,430
Who would truly be loyal?

193
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:39,240
So, Grandmaster, are we going to let them off just like this?

194
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,690
They've done so many terrible things.

195
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,100
Of course not.

196
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,320
I want those who once harmed and humiliated me

197
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:50,280
to suffer in fear,

198
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,790
to watch the things they treasure most be destroyed,

199
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:58,530
and, only after enduring the despair of hell, to finally die.

200
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:04,220
Is Shi Qianlv included as well?

201
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,180
Shi Qianlv...

202
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,860
 Grandmaster. 

203
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,470
 Your body is growing weaker by the day. 

204
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,680
 Please drink this soup. 

205
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,800
 It will help your wounds heal. 

206
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:22,030
 If I die, their dream of using the Spirit Fire will be shattered. 

207
00:14:23,319 --> 00:14:28,610
 Even if you're angry, you shouldn't take it out on your own body. 

208
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,930
 Now, drink the soup. 

209
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,230
 Be good. 

210
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,490
 Grandmaster, have a sip. 

211
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:45,320
 If you don't want it, may I drink it? 

212
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,350
 What's in that soup? 

213
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:54,040
 The blood of the Sima clan. 

214
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,230
 Why do you make me drink it? 

215
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,080
Does Shi Qianlv know what it is?

216
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,070
 Yes. 

217
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,080
 Sect Master Shi wants your wounds to heal faster 

218
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,080
 so you could nourish the Fengshan Spirit... 

219
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:07,080
 You're evil, all of you! 

220
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,630
The Eight Palaces are nothing but puppets.

221
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:14,250
Shi Qianlv is the truly interesting one.

222
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,320
From what I've seen, Shi Qianlv's cultivation

223
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,040
isn't even as high as the palace heads.

224
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,270
Since the palace heads have reached levels where the Truth Spell no longer works on them,

225
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:24,040
why don't we start with Shi Qianlv?

226
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,060
Incompetence is just his disguise.

227
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:30,100
He must have countermeasures in place.

228
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,190
Do not alert him.

229
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,440
Let him throw himself into disorder

230
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,650
and reveal weaknesses on his own.

231
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:59,880
Where else can you find an employee dorm this comfortable?

232
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:04,190
The work environment is like a scenic resort.

233
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,060
I've got the looks.

234
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:14,860
If I did my hair nicely and changed into a pretty outfit, I'd look even better.

235
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,830
They're so thoughtful.

236
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,370
Are all these for me?

237
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,350
There's room service, too?

238
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:41,180
These puppet servants are basically robots.

239
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,950
Their skin feels so real.

240
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,560
Can you also bring me some jewelry and shoes?

241
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,490
Is that a yes or no?

242
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:11,520
Now I understand what "a life as carefree as an immortal" really means.

243
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:21,990
Right now, everyone thinks I'm the boss's confidante.

244
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,920
He was so arrogant when he emerged from seclusion.

245
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,710
If I quit, would everyone take their anger out on me?

246
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:32,270
Even though the Grandmaster sometimes seems mentally unstable,

247
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,640
he's been pretty good to me.

248
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,510
He's saved my life so many times.

249
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:40,630
Besides, I still need him to help with my pain.

250
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,770
I'd better not think about quitting for now.

251
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,970
Grandmaster.

252
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,980
What brings you here?

253
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,410
Come with me.

254
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,890
All right.

255
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,050
- Greetings, Grandmaster. 
 - Greetings, Grandmaster.

256
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:09,280
Grandmaster, what are we doing here?

257
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,340
You may begin.

258
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,220
 So, this is a martial arts contest in the cultivation world? 

259
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,960
Let's put on a show for now and stall for time.

260
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,690
All right. We'll wait for the seniors to arrive.

261
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,900
Greetings, Grandmaster.

262
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:27,920
Grandmaster, why are you in the mood to come and watch the disciples' death duels today?

263
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:32,840
You call this half-hearted show a death duel?

264
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,340
Grandmaster, allow me to explain.

265
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,260
Those two in the ring are from Heaven Palace

266
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,120
and Sun Palace, respectively.

267
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,470
They are both excellent disciples

268
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:50,410
carefully trained by their palace masters.

269
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:53,600
Hurting either one would be unfortunate.

270
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:59,770
Could you let them off for the Shi family's sake?

271
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,350
Let them off?

272
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,880
Death duels are to push disciples to advance their cultivation

273
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,310
in life-and-death combat.

274
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,080
Have the Eight Palaces grown so arrogant

275
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:15,200
that they don't even follow the rules they themselves set?

276
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:20,940
Sect Master Shi, do you also approve of this?

277
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,320
 The Immortal Mansion has this kind of tradition? 

278
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,310
You heard the Grandmaster.

279
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:34,840
Take the death duels seriously.

280
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,210
Do not hold back.

281
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,750
What did we do wrong?

282
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,750
We just wanted to spare each other as fellow disciples.

283
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,750
Exactly!

284
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,030
Wanton killing of the innocent goes against morality.

285
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:52,990
We spar to learn from each other and improve our cultivation.

286
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,630
- Why must we fight to the death? 
 - Exactly.

287
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,710
 Aren't these the very rules the Eight Palaces set themselves? 

288
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:01,960
 And now, they're calling the Grandmaster evil? 

289
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:07,390
You say that I go against morality and kill the innocent.

290
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:13,090
Then let me see just how much your so-called morality is really worth.

291
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,270
- What is that? 
 - That looks like a Blood Clot Flower.

292
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,270
Really?

293
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:27,860
Is that the legendary Blood Clot Flower?

294
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,870
Disciples, any one of you here today

295
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:38,080
who can win 20 death duels

296
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,740
will earn one petal of the Fengshan Blood Clot Flower.

297
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:04,820
Apologies in advance, Junior Brother.

298
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,270
Senior Brother, you...

299
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,070
He's offering a Blood Clot Flower's petal.

300
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:14,510
It equals a millennium of cultivation.

301
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:17,590
Isn't that exactly what we train for?

302
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,120
 I can't believe they're killing each other over a single petal. 

303
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,590
 And the eight palace heads are just standing by without lifting a finger? 

304
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:06,050
 Have these disciples lost their minds? 

305
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,930
It's just a contest.

306
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:17,450
Why are they slaughtering each other?

307
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:21,050
They were all so polite just a moment ago.

308
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,910
Under the skin, they have the hearts of wolves.

309
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:32,080
Now, they are just showing their true colors.

310
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,510
Sect Master Shi.

311
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:39,700
Is the Grandmaster trying to kill all the talented disciples we've worked so hard to train?

312
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,160
This is not entirely the Grandmaster's doing.

313
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,710
Those disciples were driven by their own greed.

314
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:47,960
Easy for you to say when it's my disciples who died.

315
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,850
Palace Master Ri, calm yourself.

316
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,880
Who would have thought

317
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:00,780
that the little child from back then would become what he is today?

318
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:04,680
I fear this death duel is the Grandmaster's way

319
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,320
of giving everyone here a warning.

320
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:12,650
Sect Master Shi, you are the head of the Eight Palaces and the Grandmaster's confidant.

321
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:15,600
You must not let him keep running wild like this.

322
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,790
Sect Master Shi, we are all counting on you.

323
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,540
Very well, you may rest assured.

324
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:25,540
I will do everything I can to keep him calm.

325
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:29,620
But he has just emerged from seclusion,

326
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,650
and he's still furious.

327
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:34,610
As long as he doesn't go too far,

328
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:40,010
we should turn a blind eye.

329
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:50,110
Speak your mind.

330
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,620
Grandmaster.

331
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,520
That Blood Clot Flower you took out today seemed to be greatly sought-after.

332
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:03,810
But didn't you say it only works if it's taken with your blood?

333
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:06,780
Without your blood, the person who takes it will explode.

334
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:10,890
None of those people has drunk your blood,

335
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:14,670
so what use would it be to them even if they got it?

336
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:18,710
Not with my blood, but with the blood of the Fengshan Clan.

337
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:21,860
But aren't you the only one left of the Fengshan Clan?

338
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,490
That's right.

339
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,260
When members of the Sima family die, their bodies can't be preserved,

340
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,550
and only a bone pearl remains.

341
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,560
Do you know why?

342
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:39,640
Because the flesh and blood of the Sima clan are a rare medicine that can improve cultivation.

343
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,740
In the past, other families of the sect would divide them up.

344
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:47,270
Judging by how eager those people were to seize the Blood Clot Flower today,

345
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:52,520
every disciple there has drunk the blood of my clan.

346
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:58,450
Can't take it?

347
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,660
 This Demon Realm spy is actually more upright than many in the Immortal Mansion. 

348
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:07,200
 How strange. 

349
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,180
 So be it. I don't care where she's from. 

350
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,030
What did we do wrong?

351
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,270
 - We just wanted to spare each other.
- Exactly! Wanton killing of the innocent... 

352
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,510
 He's offering a Blood Clot Flower's petal. 

353
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,960
 It equals a millennium of cultivation. 

354
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,210
 Isn't that exactly what we train for? 

355
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:45,510
So, the boss grew up in such a cut-throat environment.

356
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:48,720
No wonder he's full of hatred for this world.

357
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:56,800
As his trusted aide, should I say something to comfort him?

358
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,110
No...

359
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,690
Liao Tingyan...

360
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:07,090
As someone without ambition, you've been lucky enough to get promoted to this position.

361
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:09,760
Don't overestimate yourself, okay?

362
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:26,200
Boss, why are you here?

363
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,400
I see.

364
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,440
The Spirit Fire must be getting to you again.

365
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,440
What is it?

366
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,890
Do you still feel irritated?

367
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,420
Is the air conditioner broken today?

368
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:04,140
 ♫ Snow not gone, flame not out ♫ 

369
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,890
 ♫ Prism of three lifetimes ♫ 

370
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:07,770
Go to sleep.

371
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,360
 This is as strange as the boss 

372
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:17,110
 telling me to clock out first when he himself is still working overtime. 

373
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:22,050
I'll... go to bed, then?

374
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:27,260
 ♫ Fall like fireworks ♫ 

375
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:31,110
 ♫ No fate's tangle, no parting swans ♫ 

376
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:33,940
 ♫ Memories fade ♫ 

377
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,310
 ♫ We wander the mortal world in search ♫ 

378
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:40,370
 ♫ Yet forget the reason why ♫ 

379
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:44,450
 ♫ Cycle back to raging flames ♫ 

380
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,740
Boss.

381
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,560
If you...

382
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,630
I...

383
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,290
 ♫ I light up the endless night ♫ 

384
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:54,190
 ♫ To chase the darkness away from your dreams ♫ 

385
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:56,300
 ♫ Even if heaven and earth turned to ash ♫ 

386
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,020
Can you really sleep like this?

387
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,840
 ♫ I would never regret the day I met you ♫ 

388
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,400
 Well, considering how good the benefits of this job are, 

389
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,710
 I should make some concessions for the boss. 

390
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:11,580
 Sima Jiao seems like a career-obsessed man with no interest in women. 

391
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,140
 If he wants to stay here, I guess he can. 

392
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:22,530
 As expected, she not only eases the burning pain from the Spirit Fire 

393
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:26,190
 but also somehow calms my anger. 

394
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:33,760
Wake up.

395
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,860
Wake up.

396
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,980
Get up.

397
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,580
No more sleeping.

398
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,500
What is it, dear boss?

399
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,370
Can't you consider a beauty's need for beauty sleep?

400
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:59,260
Lack of sleep causes dark circles.

401
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,560
How can you even fall asleep?

402
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:05,310
Why wouldn't I fall asleep?

403
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:07,390
Because I am here.

404
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,540
So?

405
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:12,040
In the entire Gengchen Immortal Mansion,

406
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:17,800
anyone who has heard my name fears me.

407
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:22,960
How can you sleep so soundly next to me?

408
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,910
I just get great sleep here.

409
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:28,150
I can't help it.

410
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,820
You are impossible to figure out.

411
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:36,750
Fine, since you're such a night owl,

412
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,380
I'll make sacrifices and keep you company.

413
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:44,170
A night owl?

414
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:48,390
It means someone like you with an irregular sleep cycle.

415
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:53,060
Where do you come up with all these strange phrases?

416
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:57,380
I guess I'm just quick-witted.

417
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:28,190
Father. I heard Sima Jiao made over 100 disciples fight in death duels,

418
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:31,400
and many favored disciples of the Eight Palaces died.

419
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,640
How did the palace heads take that?

420
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,040
Did they pressure you?

421
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:40,760
Of course they are displeased.

422
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:46,130
But they won't openly protest for now.

423
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:49,540
After all, no one wants to anger Sima Jiao.

424
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,810
Besides, Tian Wuya and I are working together.

425
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:57,960
 As long as he doesn't come for us, so what if the Grandmaster kills a few people? 

426
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:02,180
 If he were to wipe us all out, he'd end up gravely injured, too. 

427
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,380
 There would be nothing in it for him. 

428
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,720
Besides, the new palace heads have only just taken office.

429
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,610
The situation is still unstable.

430
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:13,070
At most, they hold some resentment.

431
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,960
I've already calmed them down.

432
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,090
Then, Father, are we just going to let Sima Jiao run wild like this?

433
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:22,660
If this goes on, the Eight Palaces may slip from our control.

434
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,310
Sima Jiao was sealed for so long.

435
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:28,170
His resentment cannot be dispelled easily.

436
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:32,210
Of course he'd want to kill a few people to vent his anger.

437
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:35,340
Besides, it's just a few disciples who died.

438
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,510
If he wants to kill them, so be it.

439
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:43,450
Even though he is a madman now, he will still listen to a few things I say.

440
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:46,710
We just have to handle him with care.

441
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:48,840
Before our great plan is complete,

442
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,680
we must keep the Eight Palaces under control so they remain useful to us,

443
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,070
and we also need to prevent Sima Jiao

444
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,020
from acting too wildly.

445
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:57,920
 

446
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:02,270
Grandmaster, the disciples of all the palaces have gathered at the arena.

447
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:05,830
They're asking when today's death duels will begin.

448
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:09,680
They are even willing to give up their lives

449
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,050
for the Blood Clot Flower?

450
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:18,590
Shi Qianlv and the eight palace heads don't seem to care about those disciples.

451
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,280
After the last round of death duels,

452
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:25,810
Shi Qianlv merely offered a few words of comfort and brushed the matter aside.

453
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:30,340
It seems like there's a mole for him among the palace heads.

454
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,290
A mole?

455
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:35,360
Could it be Tian Wuya?

456
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,110
He's the only one who seems rather close to Shi Qianlv.

457
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:42,090
White Deer Cliff's spirit veins were supposed to be under the Shi family's care.

458
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:44,700
It looks like Shi Qian Lv really has given him some benefits.

459
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,590
What?

460
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:49,190
No wonder his cultivation has been improving so quickly.

461
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,720
I've heard he's already reached the Body Integration  stage.

462
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,370
Shi Qianlv is absolutely shameless.

463
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:56,190
These spiritual veins aren't his to give away.

464
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:58,180
He's only a gatekeeper.

465
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,570
What right does he have to play generous?

466
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:02,570
Tian Wuya...

467
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:06,240
That name sounds familiar.

468
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,440
 Father, Sima Jiao's cultivation has been improving fast. 

469
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,760
 Will he be strong enough to break free from these chains one day? 

470
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,590
 Don't worry, Wuya. 

471
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:16,260
 The eight sealing nails have been driven deep into his body.  
  

472
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:20,980
 Even if he breaks the chains one day, he will never escape the suppression of the nails. 

473
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:26,190
 But what if he cannot bear the pain and kills himself? 

474
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,880
 His life is tied to the Spirit Fire. 

475
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,040
 If he dies, won't the Immortal Mansion's spiritual veins all die away? 

476
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,670
 Young Master Palace Tian, you have a point. 

477
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,090
 What do you suggest? 

478
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:42,810
 I think we should add another restriction to the seals. 

479
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:54,150
What stage did you just say he was at?

480
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:57,900
Tian Wuya has just entered the Body Integration stage.

481
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,880
Is there a banquet today?

482
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,320
Yes. Today, Heaven Palace is holding a flower banquet

483
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,210
and has invited disciples from all the palaces.

484
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:07,120
It should be lively.

485
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,420
Good.

486
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:16,290
Then we will join the fun and have a little game with Tian Wuya

487
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:18,990
Great, Grandmaster. When will we leave?

488
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:21,170
Once Liao Tingyan wakes up.

489
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,680
Grandmaster, is this your way of showing concern for Tingyan?

490
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,550
Do you want her to sleep a bit longer?

491
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,470
You dare to speculate about my thoughts now?

492
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:48,890
Waking up naturally without an alarm feels amazing.

493
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,820
Wow.

494
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,653
Let's see.

495
00:37:09,653 --> 00:37:12,620
What pretty clothes have they brought me this time?

496
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:25,110
Mirror, mirror, who's the most beautiful woman in the world?

497
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,300
It's Liao Tingyan!

498
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,300
Trying on outfits is so much fun!

499
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,990
Boss.

500
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:49,890
- Let's go. 
 - I just worked overtime yesterday.

501
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:51,570
Can I have a rest today?

502
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:52,570
What is overtime?

503
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:56,900
It's when you want an employee to be available 24 hours a day, like now.

504
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:59,310
So, you don't want to come with me?

505
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,580
It's not that I don't want to.

506
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,260
Why don't you want to?

507
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,630
I'm afraid I might see dead people.

508
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:11,550
 A person from the Demon Realm is afraid of dead bodies? 

509
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:17,050
If you don't come, I will kill you first.

510
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:21,880
Let me just change into something
easier to move in.

511
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:28,020
Follow me.

512
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:33,280
At least let me change!

513
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:41,420
 Oh, the smell of fruit. 

514
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:46,360
Boss, where are we going?

515
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,120
To kill someone.

516
00:38:54,980 --> 00:39:04,980


517
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:22,530
song title

518
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:24,600
 ♫ Autumn winds sigh ♫ 

519
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,770
 ♫ Moon and stars dapple the sky ♫

 ♫ Shimmering in the night ♫ 

524
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,690
 ♫ With a brush I draw ♫ 

525
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:42,670
 ♫ The color of light ♫ 

526
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:46,620
 ♫ To warm your frozen soul ♫ 

527

528
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,550
 ♫ Longing is engraved ♫ 

529
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:54,090
 ♫ Yet cannot be touched ♫ 

530
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:56,330
 ♫ Following ♫ 

531
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:58,670
 ♫ The veins of gravel ♫ 

532
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:02,520
 ♫ I turn into spirit fire ♫ 

533
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,370
 ♫ Burning away ♫ 

534
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:09,470
 ♫ All these karmic ties ♫ 

535
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:12,750
 ♫ To save you ♫ 

536
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,790
 ♫ To save me ♫ 

537
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:18,670
 ♫ To cross over all suffering,
I'll break through ♫ 

538
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:20,760
 ♫ The laws of heaven ♫ 

539
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,710
 ♫ The vortex of reincarnation ♫ 

540
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:26,710
 ♫ What of life and death? ♫ 

541
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,670
 ♫ To save you ♫ 

542
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,630
 ♫ To save me ♫ 

543
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:34,510
 ♫ To redeem all beings, I'll let pass ♫ 

544
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,710
 ♫ Right and wrong ♫ 

545
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,670
 ♫ Rumors and tales ♫ 

546
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:42,150
 ♫ To seize fate ♫ 

547
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:45,950
 ♫ With my own hands ♫ 

548

 ♫ For the healing of wounds ♫ 

551
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,690
 ♫ I'll stir the murky seas ♫ 

552
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:58,740
 ♫ And strive against the heavens ♫ 

553
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:02,700
 ♫ To protect the vastness ♫ 

554
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,650
 ♫ For you ♫ 

555

 ♫ For the light of dawn ♫ 

557
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:12,780
 ♫ I'll face promises ♫ 

558
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,790
 ♫ Like a moth to a flame ♫ 

559
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:20,430
 ♫ And use my body to shine ♫ 

560
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:26,590
 ♫ On even more ♫
