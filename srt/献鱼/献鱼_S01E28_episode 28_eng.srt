1
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,600
 ♫ Heavens strike with thunderous wrath ♫ 

2
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,480
 ♫ Mountains and rivers shatter before my eyes ♫ 

3
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,680
 ♫ Endless splendor
cultivated through lifetimes ♫ 

4
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,440
 ♫ Turns to dust between my fingers
in an instant ♫ 

5
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,120
 ♫ When the line
between good and evil is clear ♫ 

6
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,240
 ♫ Countless souls drift
into the boundless wilds ♫ 

7
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,400
 ♫ Carrying the spirit fire forward ♫ 

8
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,480
 ♫ I defy fate ♫ 

9
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,880
 ♫ Just to remain by your side ♫ 

10
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,880
 ♫ Falling into love's abyss ♫ 

11
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,760
 ♫ Like heavy rain pouring down ♫ 

12
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,360
 ♫ Drunk on romance ♫ 

13
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,320
 ♫ In a blink, love and hate
vanish into illusion ♫ 

14
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,360
 ♫ Falling into endless love ♫ 

15
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,520
 ♫ Stirring waves upending a lifetime ♫ 

16
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,760
 ♫ Even if this life leads to ruin ♫ 

17
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,920
 ♫ I still choose to be entangled with you ♫ 

18
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,025
 ♫ Through all lifetimes ♫ 

19
00:01:30,025 --> 00:01:36,480
 

20
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,700
 

21
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,260
Then why don't we start with a celebration?

22
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,090
It would lift everyone's spirits.

23
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,070
What is there to celebrate?

24
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:55,990
How about a marriage
between an immortal and a demon?

25
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:09,010
Are you proposing to me?

26
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:10,880
If you think of it that way,

27
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,320
I cannot deny it.

28
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,880
How dare you tease me?

29
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,640
Then, when shall we marry?

30
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,550
Since you have asked,

31
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,510
the sooner the better.

32
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,320
It need not be so soon.

33
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,230
I'm not in such a hurry.

34
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,880
Is that so?

35
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,350
The Demon Mistress can wait.

36
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,350
The Immortal Lord can't.

37
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,420
I'll take you over there.

38
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,170
They have candied hawthorns.

39
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,260
Come and take a look.

40
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,720
It seems the uniting of immortals and demons
in Yan City has borne fruit.

41
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:34,220
If only every place in the world
could be this harmonious,

42
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,450
how wonderful it would be.

43
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,200
You sounded like a ruler of the Demon Realm.

44
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,980
Chestnut steamed cake.

45
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,170
Crystal Fish Slices!

46
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,140
Peony meatballs. Crispy honeyed fruit.

47
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,760
How did you know I've been craving these?

48
00:03:50,665 --> 00:03:52,690
Does this not surpass

49
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,530
the food street you are so familiar with?

50
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,490
It totally does.

51
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,770
I can stay home
and still taste the finest delicacies.

52
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,740
It's as if you live in my mind like a parasite.

53
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,200
How bold.

54
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,200
Did you call me a parasite?

55
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,550
Yan.

56
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,790
It has been a while.

57
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,690
Jiao.

58
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,350
Why have you come?

59
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,660
Yan's inner core can't merge
with the demon core.

60
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,010
If this continues, she is going to die.

61
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,670
I can help her.

62
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,320
How can you help her?

63
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,080
The Chang family has a secret technique
for merging cores.

64
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,760
Perhaps I can try that.

65
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,910
Where is Ming Li?

66
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:47,080
The last time I saw him
was in the forests of the Demon Realm.

67
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,300
He may have already fled by now.

68
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,340
Why does your Spirit Fire mark look so strange?

69
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,660
Weren't your wounds already healed?

70
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,000
It's nothing.

71
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,100
I only need some rest.

72
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,420
It was the same before.

73
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,440
You don't need to worry.

74
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,680
What matters most right now is your inner core.

75
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,660
You shouldn't be too anxious.

76
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,900
Feng Qi said there's still hope.

77
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,760
Feng Qi, are you really willing to save me?

78
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,470
Yan, I lured you to the White Bone Abyss.

79
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,690
I abused your trust.

80
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,680
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,350
But this time, I want to make amends.

82
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,250
Please give me a chance.

83
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,660
Jiao.

84
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,490
Why not give Feng Qi another chance?

85
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,680
He has a good nature.

86
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,490
He was only being used.

87
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:01,830
Besides, the only one who knew
Soul Cleanse, Shi Qian Lv, is dead.

88
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,050
With your Truth Spell,

89
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,250
he can't lie.

90
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,610
Feng Qi.

91
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,200
I'll entrust the matter
of merging the cores to you.

92
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,220
I'll give it my all.

93
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,640
Well?

94
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,830
No discomfort.

95
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,640
It's only stabilized for now.

96
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,030
The Demon Lord's inner core is too powerful.

97
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:12,540
To merge it completely will take some time.

98
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,130
I'll brew you some medicine to strengthen you.

99
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,980
Shouldn't you check the cores?

100
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:46,100
The two cores have already started to merge.

101
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,740
It seems we misunderstood Feng Qi.

102
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,540
It's best if he has come around.

103
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,540
I can't help but feel

104
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,810
the lead is too good to be true.

105
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:06,520
You're overthinking.

106
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,790
From this day forward,

107
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,660
only good days await us.

108
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,120
I never realized before

109
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,930
that the Celestial Palace had such good wine.

110
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,350
And why should this wine be said
to come from the Celestial Palace?

111
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,820
The Demon Realm also has such fine wine.

112
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,610
How laughable.

113
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,960
All the spirit food on today's banquet table

114
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,870
was gathered by our Grandmaster.

115
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,400
Even this wine is brimming
with spiritual energy.

116
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,920
How could the Demon Realm possess it?

117
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,710
What the Demon Realm has

118
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,560
is nothing but sorcery

119
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,610
and poisonous miasma.

120
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,460
Say that again if you dare.

121
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,980
You dare assault a general!

122
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,580
Stand down!

123
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,470
This banquet in Yan City was held

124
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,010
to celebrate peace
between the Immortal and Demon Realms.

125
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,400
And yet you behave in this manner.

126
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,890
Do you mean to go against the command
of the Grandmaster and the Demon Mistress?

127
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,800
Enough.

128
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,200
It's getting late.

129
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,990
Go home now.

130
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,800
Don't cause any more trouble.

131
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,180
Yes.

132
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,440
You heard the General.

133
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,160
- Let's go!
- Yes.

134
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,280
Rest assured, General.

135
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,280
We'll find a way to have payback!

136
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,920
- Right.
- The Gengchen Celestial Palace is nothing!

137
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,990
Nothing but hypocrites with flowery words.

138
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,610
Enough.

139
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,460
I was too rash.

140
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,280
Our Demon Mistress must keep the land safe.

141
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,460
Let her enjoy some peaceful days.

142
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,060
If you want to hold your head high
before those of the Celestial Palace,

143
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,630
then lead your people under your care

144
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,610
and show them some worth.

145
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,920
Let's go.

146
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,290
Yes.

147
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,110
This wound was indeed the cause
of Commander Niu San's death.

148
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,510
Yes.

149
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,770
It came from General Chi's technique.

150
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,440
Chi An He, I knew it.

151
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,470
You killed our commander while he was drunk.

152
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,830
Despicable! Shameless! Vile!

153
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,800
You'll pay for this!

154
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,200
That is utter slander.

155
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,280
If I, Chi An He, wanted to kill someone,

156
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,800
I'd do it righteously and make it clean.

157
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,870
Why would I hide it?

158
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:56,860
Stop denying your crime!

159
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,940
Hong Luo, Nian Jiu!

160
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:15,290
This is the resentment they left behind.

161
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,180
It seems only I see it.

162
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,040
Bah!

163
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,230
Those of the Celestial Palace

164
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,750
may look fancy on the surface, but in truth,

165
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,040
you're nothing but cowards
who won't admit your crime!

166
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,040
Spineless clowns!

167
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,160
I dare you to return
the pork knuckle I gave you!

168
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,110
- Spit it out!
- Despicable wretch!

169
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,230
You'd even harm the common folk
of the Demon Realm.

170
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,870
This man clearly fell on his own.

171
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,250
Nonsense!

172
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,710
The demon core in your body is unstable.

173
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,590
It's disturbing your mind.

174
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,340
Your inner power is conflicted.

175
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:52,530
Hence, the discomfort.

176
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,110
And Master, when I was in meditation,

177
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,490
I found the core had grown much larger.

178
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,350
It must be linked
to the resentment you mentioned.

179
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,110
Immortals thrive on spiritual energy.

180
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,680
Demons feed on malice.

181
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,750
That resentment will only fuel
the demon core within you.

182
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,510
As the core grows stronger,

183
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:15,370
once it surpasses your own inner core,

184
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,370
you'll begin to lose your mind

185
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,830
and lose control.

186
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,710
Wouldn't that mean I'd be
under this cursed core's control,

187
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:28,040
and become a mindless shell?

188
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,890
Is there any solution?

189
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,200
To keep you alive,

190
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,800
the demon core has started merging
with your inner core.

191
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,130
It can no longer be removed.

192
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:44,010
If the two cores don't merge, I'll die.

193
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,040
But if they do,

194
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,740
the resentment within will make me a threat.

195
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,060
For now,

196
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,320
we must first resolve the case of Niu San.

197
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,200
Easing the resentment of both realms

198
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,080
might stabilize the demon core for a time.

199
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,220
It's only a stopgap measure.

200
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:09,630
But as your master,
I swear I'll find a cure for you.

201
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:15,470
Master, until we do find a way,
don't tell Sima Jiao.

202
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,920
He's only just recovered.

203
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,100
I don't want him worrying about me.

204
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,630
To prove whether Niu San

205
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:37,160
was truly killed by General Chi
isn't difficult.

206
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,960
However, to verify it would put General Chi

207
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,080
in an unjust position.

208
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,280
To calm the public uproar,

209
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,130
General Chi, will you prove your innocence?

210
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,590
I have nothing to hide.

211
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,220
Of course I will.

212
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,040
I'll use the Soul Search,

213
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,340
and let everyone see
what really happened that night.

214
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,650
 Say that again if you dare. 

215
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:32,650
 You dare assault a general! 

216
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,460
 Stand down! 

217
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,040
 This banquet in Yan City was held 

218
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,080
 to celebrate peace between
the Immortal and Demon Realms. 

219
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,080
 And yet you behave in this manner. 

220
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,700
 Do you mean to go against the command
of the Grandmaster and the Demon Mistress? 

221
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,590
 Rest assured, General. 

222
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:52,510
 We'll find a way to have payback! 

223
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:55,400
 - Right.
- The Gengchen Celestial Palace is nothing! 

224
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,510
 Nothing but hypocrites with flowery words. 

225
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,320
 Enough. 

226
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,700
 Let's go. 

227
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,740
 Yes. 

228
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:16,090
 I'll show you who the real hypocrites are. 

229
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,640
 A true man doesn't strike the helpless. 

230
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,530
 Once you're done, we'll have a proper match. 

231
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,880
 - Where are you taking me?
- General Chi. 

232
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,120
 Tell him. 

233
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,750
 I can still drink! 

234
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,270
 You, come out here! 

235
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,710
 General Chi. 

236
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:49,460
 I can still drink three days
and three nights straight! 

237
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,380
How are you feeling?

238
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,640
It's nothing.

239
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,380
It seems the most crucial memory is gone.

240
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,030
The technique used to kill Commander Niu San

241
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,770
looked the same as General Chi's.

242
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,680
But the aura within it

243
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,250
matches the demonic energy in me.

244
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:38,360
Nian Jiu, join me in tracking
the demonic trace left on Niu San's wound

245
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,840
and find out where Ming Li is hiding.

246
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,050
He can't be innocent in this.

247
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,290
Yes.

248
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,680
 You think swallowing a demon core
makes you the Demon Mistress? 

249
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,640
 Keep dreaming. 

250
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,980
 Sooner or later,
you'll be nothing but my puppet. 

251
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,440
 What's going on? 

252
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,010
 Wasn't I just resting in the hall? 

253
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,530
 How did I end up here? 

254
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,900
Yan.

255
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,140
Hong Luo.

256
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:51,680
The streets outside are desolate.

257
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,360
If this matter isn't resolved soon,

258
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,090
Yan City will become a ghost town.

259
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,600
Hong Luo.

260
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,550
- Here.
- I feel there's more to Niu San's death.

261
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,550
I know.

262
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:09,070
You think someone is pulling strings
in the shadows,

263
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,200
trying to stir up chaos.

264
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,790
Not just that.

265
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:14,680
I suspect the real target

266
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,090
is me.

267
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,960
On the day of Yan City's upheaval,

268
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,270
the people's resentment fed the demon core.

269
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,360
My master said,

270
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,680
as the demon core grows,

271
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,600
I'll lose my reason and fall under its sway.

272
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,070
That is why I've been irritable
and full of spite these days.

273
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:34,420
I've even lost pieces of memory.

274
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:36,840
How so?

275
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,640
Just today, one moment I was in the hall,

276
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,360
the next I was in the tavern.

277
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,230
I don't even know how I got here.

278
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,840
During my meditation,

279
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,960
I found out the demon core
has nearly devoured my inner core.

280
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,290
What?

281
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,840
Does Sima Jiao know?

282
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,050
If he knew my inner core was damaged,
he'd be frantic.

283
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,740
I don't want him to worry.

284
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,510
What about Feng Qi?

285
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,250
Have you asked him?

286
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,550
The day after the Yan City banquet,

287
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,920
he asked to go to Ghost City to restore order.

288
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,230
I thought he felt ill at ease in Yan City,

289
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,360
so I let him go.

290
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,470
No! If this drags on,

291
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:24,510
the demon core will seize your mind for good!

292
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,160
I'll send word to Ghost City at once,

293
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,270
and get Feng Qi back.

294
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,660
Wait here.

295
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,900
Where's You Yan?

296
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,620
I don't know.

297
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,140
No more lies.

298
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,160
In the mortal realm,

299
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,680
at the entrance to the Nine Nether Purgatory.

300
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,490
The Nine Nether Purgatory?

301
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,850
He wants to release
the Demonic Army sealed there.

302
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,740
Where is the entrance?

303
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,920
No spell you use will work.

304
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,220
I don't know where the entrance is either.

305
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,400
And Bi An?

306
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,700
She's already been possessed
by the former Demon Lord.

307
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:33,810
Are you involved in Niu San's death?

308
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,380
Yes.

309
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,940
I infused Feng Qi with demonic energy.

310
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:54,030
That energy let me
use his obsession to control him.

311
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:56,700
So, Feng Qi was helping Liao Ting Yan
merge her cores

312
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,330
because you planned it.

313
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,840
The Chang clan's secret art
can indeed merge cores,

314
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,030
but the Demon Lord's core is too powerful.

315
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:10,550
Even if they merge,
the evil one will devour the other,

316
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,030
never the other way around.

317
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:14,440
When that happens, she'll be utterly reduced

318
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,570
to the former Demon Lord's puppet.

319
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,230
Grandmaster.

320
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:26,070
Was he involved in Niu San's murder?

321
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,490
Yes.

322
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,290
Ting Yan is in danger.

323
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,420
Yan.

324
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,420
Sima Jiao!

325
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,770
Ting Yan.

326
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,530
Why did you kill Niu San?

327
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,640
By using his death to stir up chaos
between immortals and demons,

328
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,880
resentment would spread in the world.

329
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,160
That would strengthen
the Demon Lord's core inside Yan.

330
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,920
Only then could I kill Sima Jiao.

331
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,810
And only then would nothing
stand between me and Yan!

332
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,010
When chaos engulfs both realms,

333
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,980
Liao Ting Yan will just be my puppet.
I, You Yan, pull the strings.

334
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,010
Everyone.

335
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:25,180
You heard him.

336
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,920
So, he's the real culprit!

337
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,920
Only your death will ease our anger!

338
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,710
- Kill him!
- Finish him!

339
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,880
You brought them here to eavesdrop?

340
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,710
Despicable.

341
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,750
But what of it?

342
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:45,600
Liao Ting Yan is already
under the demon energy's control.

343
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,510
Sima Jiao, you might suppress it for a time,

344
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,740
but never for life.

345
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,550
Liao Ting Yan, arise!

346
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,490
Kill him!

347
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,420
- Yan!
- Grandmaster!

348
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,600
Ting Yan.

349
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,840
It's me, Ting Yan.

350
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,380
Wake up.

351
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,790
Ting Yan!

352
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,420
What happened?

353
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,740
Ting Yan.

354
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,270
I didn't hurt you, did I?

355
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,620
No.

356
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,220
Yan.

357
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,380
Feng Qi.

358
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,310
I know your heart
still clings to that Frost Fish.

359
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,840
But I'm not her.

360
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,840
She and I are two completely different people.

361
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,420
Do you understand?

362
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,980
Yan...

363
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:27,530
You're happy now... right?

364
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,980
That's

365
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:41,200
enough.

366
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,570
Feng Qi.

367
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,180
Yan...

368
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,010
I'm sorry.

369
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,680
His cultivation has been destroyed,

370
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,290
and he will soon perish.

371
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:14,180
He paid a heavy price for this.

372
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,250
This concludes the case.

373
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,980
Yes.

374
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,770
As usual.

375
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,330
The slow one...

376
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,180
Treats the rest to wine.

377
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,140
Both of you.

378
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,250
Take care.

379
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,570
Ting Yan.

380
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,090
Are you all right?

381
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,470
A little better now.

382
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:34,440
But the demon core
still carries demonic energy.

383
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,960
There's still a risk of being controlled.

384
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,330
You Yan has only a shred of soul left.

385
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,810
He is no threat.

386
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,530
I will be in seclusion for a month.

387
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,980
When I emerge,

388
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:51,840
the demonic energy in you will be gone.

389
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,790
Why must it take so long?

390
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,470
Why can't we get married first?

391
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:59,400
You wanted us to hold the ceremony soon.

392
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,570
Is the demonic energy in me too hard to purge?

393
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,810
Or has the wound you took
in the White Bone Abyss relapsed?

394
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,810
Who is Sima Jiao?

395
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:23,330
Sima Jiao is the greatest Grandmaster
Gengchen Celestial Palace has ever known.

396
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,530
Then, put your heart at ease.

397
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:31,270
When I return,

398
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,360
we will be married.

399
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,850
All right.

400
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,770
I've never seen this design before.

401
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:49,200
Good.

402
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,000
Great.

403
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,680
- Great.
- A little higher.

404
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,790
Come again next time.

405
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:00,910
- Great.
- I'll take two.

406
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,400
Thank you.

407
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,770
Take this.

408
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,920
Don't get emotional.

409
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,930
It's leftovers.

410
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,000
Hold it tight.

411
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,030
Come again next time.

412
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,660
Who said I'm touched?

413
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,810
It's ruined embroidery.

414
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,230
Step right up, take a look.

415
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,200
Grandmaster once said,

416
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,200
as long as you uphold peace
between the two realms,

417
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,990
and respect the new Demon Mistress,

418
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:39,400
you'll be granted endless spiritual power.

419
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,510
Yet you ungrateful fools

420
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:45,550
not only stirred up strife
between immortals and demons,

421
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:47,940
you even plotted to have her killed!

422
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,310
Are you so tired of living?

423
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:52,710
What's so great about her?

424
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:55,050
Why should she be our ruler?

425
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,200
Slaughtering the weak.

426
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,550
Is that what you call strength?

427
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:09,050
The weak deserve to die anyway.

428
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,490
We follow the Demon Mistress.

429
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:27,090
- Out.
- Yes.

430
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,440
Grandmaster.

431
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,790
What's wrong?

432
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:38,380
Didn't your wounds heal in Thunder Valley?

433
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,710
I have only just recovered.

434
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:43,570
I still need rest.

435
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,570
Hence, the seclusion.

436
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,750
Don't tell Ting Yan of this.

437
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,180
Yes.

438
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:08,990
Sima Jiao.

439
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:11,920
Snuff out whatever foolish idea
you have in your head.

440
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,500
I don't care if you die, I still want to live!

441
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,440
You are becoming more and more like her now.

442
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,180
You even eavesdrop now.

443
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,180
Grandmaster.

444
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:35,370
What did the little flame mean by its words?

445
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,760
When was it your place to question me?

446
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:44,720
Even if I must defy you,

447
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,020
I still have the right to ask for answers.

448
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,550
Do you really think

449
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,590
thunderbolts could truly heal him?

450
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,670
It only slowed
the Spirit Fire's drain on his life.

451
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,060
Grandmaster.

452
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,630
Then, how will you ever recover?

453
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,320
What recovery is there?

454
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,590
There's none.

455
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,030
If he hadn't sought death himself,

456
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:08,280
he could've lived another 70 to 80 years.

457
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,110
Now he can't even endure another year.

458
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,920
That's nonsense.

459
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,400
Grandmaster and Ting Yan are living happily.

460
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,440
Why would he wish to die?

461
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,410
Grandmaster still means
to purify Ting Yan's demon core.

462
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,970
Purify...

463
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,740
Purify the demon core...

464
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:45,370
You've not been a city lord for nothing.

465
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,890
Grandmaster.

466
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,250
Be honest with me.

467
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,970
Must Ting Yan's demon core be purified

468
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,990
at the cost of your life?

469
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,850
I am not dead yet.

470
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,440
It's not your time to mourn.

471
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,070
Grandmaster.

472
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:09,250
Then we... we still have other ways, right?

473
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:14,890
But if you actually leave us one day,

474
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:18,100
what will become of Ting Yan?

475
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:26,770
In both realms now,

476
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:30,240
there are only the ones she loves.

477
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,970
I've already carved
their fear of the Spirit Fire

478
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:36,580
deep into their very bones.

479
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,060
They fear the Spirit Fire.

480
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:44,140
They fear me, too.

481
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,740
When word spreads that she slew me
and seized the Spirit Fire,

482
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:56,220
her name as Immortal-Demon Ruler
will be unshaken.

483
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,660
But if that happens, you won't survive.

484
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,510
Grandmaster.

485
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:06,970
Grandmaster.

486
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,410
Grandmaster.

487
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,500
Grandmaster.

488
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,100
If she lives,

489
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,740
then I live.

490
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,370
Don't let her know of this.

491
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,580
 Good. The hands are still cold. 

492
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,540
 If they were warm, it'd be an ill omen. 

493
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,970
What is it?

494
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:18,180
Weren't you in seclusion?

495
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,450
Why are you sleeping like a log?

496
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,020
This is my method of relaxing in seclusion.

497
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,620
I learned it from you.

498
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,060
Where's the little flame?

499
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,250
I haven't seen it around lately.

500
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:43,360
It's noisy.

501
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,250
I locked it away.

502
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,990
I am still in seclusion.

503
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:50,320
Yet, you barge in.

504
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,320
What if I lose control?

505
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,440
You're the greatest devil of all.

506
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,620
What's there to fear?

507
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,330
Quite the nerve.

508
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:17,500
My cultivation partner.

509
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:21,220
Shall I enter your Soul Manor?

510
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:27,020
 ♫ Endless splendor
cultivated through lifetimes ♫ 

511
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:32,290
If that's your wish, so be it.

512
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:38,780
 ♫ Countless souls drift
into the boundless wilds ♫ 

513
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:42,420
 ♫ Carrying the spirit fire forward ♫ 

514
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:47,400
 ♫ I defy fate just to remain by your side ♫ 

515
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,140
Why does your Soul Manor
look more and more like mine?

516
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,590
Last time there was only
a small cluster of flowers.

517
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:59,220
It's changed so much since then.

518
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,550
All thanks to the Grandmistress
who took thunderbolts from the heavens.

519
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,060
That's right.

520
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:10,140
 ♫ Upending a lifetime ♫ 

521
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:13,220
 ♫ Even if this life leads to ruin ♫ 

522
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:17,660
 ♫ I still choose to be entangled with you ♫ 

523
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:21,700
 ♫ Through all lifetimes ♫ 

524
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:30,280
Let's go.

525
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,840
Are we leaving already?

526
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,060
Do you really want another round?

527
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,880
 ♫ Autumn winds sigh ♫ 

528
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,960
 ♫ Moon and stars dapple the sky ♫ 

529
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:35,880
 ♫ Brushing the loneliness of bygone days ♫ 

530
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,800
 ♫ Candlelight flickers low ♫ 

531
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,040
 ♫ Shadows sway ♫ 

532
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:43,800
 ♫ Shimmering in the night ♫ 

533
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,880
 ♫ With a brush I draw ♫ 

534
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,840
 ♫ The color of light ♫ 

535
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,840
 ♫ To warm your frozen soul ♫ 

536
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,880
 ♫ Memories anchor here ♫ 

537
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,920
 ♫ Longing is engraved ♫ 

538
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,240
 ♫ Yet cannot be touched ♫ 

539
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,600
 ♫ Following ♫ 

540
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,040
 ♫ The veins of gravel ♫ 

541
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,880
 ♫ I turn into spirit fire ♫ 

542
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,760
 ♫ Burning away ♫ 

543
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:15,840
 ♫ All these karmic ties ♫ 

544
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,040
 ♫ To save you ♫ 

545
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,080
 ♫ To save me ♫ 

546
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:23,960
 ♫ To cross over all suffering,
I'll break through ♫ 

547
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,000
 ♫ The laws of heaven ♫ 

548
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 ♫ The vortex of reincarnation ♫ 

549
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,160
 ♫ What of life and death? ♫ 

550
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,960
 ♫ To save you ♫ 

551
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,920
 ♫ To save me ♫ 

552
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,800
 ♫ To redeem all beings, I'll let pass ♫ 

553
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,840
 ♫ Right and wrong ♫ 

554
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,920
 ♫ Rumors and tales ♫ 

555
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,640
 ♫ To seize fate ♫ 

556
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:51,240
 ♫ With my own hands ♫ 

557
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,040
 ♫ For you ♫ 

558
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,040
 ♫ For me ♫ 

559
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:59,760
 ♫ For the healing of wounds ♫ 

560
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,880
 ♫ I'll stir the murky seas ♫ 

561
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,000
 ♫ And strive against the heavens ♫ 

562
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,760
 ♫ To protect the vastness ♫ 

563
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,840
 ♫ For you ♫ 

564
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,720
 ♫ For me ♫ 

565
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:15,880
 ♫ For the light of dawn ♫ 

566
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,960
 ♫ I'll face promises ♫ 

567
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,920
 ♫ Like a moth to a flame ♫ 

568
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:27,080
 ♫ And use my body to shine ♫ 

569
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:31,720
 ♫ On even more ♫
