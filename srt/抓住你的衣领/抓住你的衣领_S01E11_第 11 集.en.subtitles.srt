1
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:49,340
ALL LOCATIONS, PEOPLE, ORGANIZATIONS,
INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:53,261
3 YEARS AGO

3
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,537
I read your novel and it's the worst.

4
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:21,498
It's horrible.

5
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,834
Hey, I'm working right now.

6
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,462
Aren't you curious as a writer

7
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,465
why readers said it was the worst?

8
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,928
What's so bad about it?

9
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,638
The male protagonist

10
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:39,349
did what he did for the sake
of the woman he loves.

11
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,809
Why should he go to jail?

12
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,977
He committed a crime.

13
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:45,021
Why is that a crime?

14
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:49,400
It was his dream, his love
and his innocent desire.

15
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:52,153
It was just him being delusional.

16
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,446
"Delusional"?

17
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,408
They truly loved each other.

18
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:00,954
Well…

19
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:07,418
Yes.

20
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,880
Yes, we're keeping the reservation.
That's right.

21
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,799
Okay, thank you.

22
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:14,467
I'll see you tomorrow.

23
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,428
Reservation for what?

24
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,056
I booked a concert hall.

25
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,141
A concert hall?

26
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,059
Why?

27
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,979
I'm getting married tomorrow.

28
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,273
You're getting married?

29
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,442
Jeong-won and I
will have a private wedding.

30
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:33,778
What?

31
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:36,531
But you're against marriage.

32
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,951
You told me you'd never get married.

33
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,663
I know, right? I find it fascinating too.

34
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:48,668
Who knew I'd find someone
I want to spend the rest of my life with?

35
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,891
Okay, got it.

36
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,020
Yoo Yun-yeong's on the wanted list.

37
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:51,064
Mo Soo-rin will defend her to the end.

38
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,607
We must catch her soon.

39
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,609
She turned her phone off two days ago.

40
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:57,403
That means she fled.
Could she have stowed away?

41
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,613
She wouldn't do that.

42
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,573
Seol Woo-jae's here.

43
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,076
She did everything to get to him.

44
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:06,704
-She wouldn't give up on him.
-Yoo Yun-yeong's phone turned on.

45
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,915
-What? Where?
-The express bus terminal.

46
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,334
-Go get her.
-Okay.

47
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,962
VIOLENT CRIMES UNIT 1

48
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,049
-Hey, go that way.
-Okay.

49
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,304
Sorry.

50
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,181
Excuse me. Sorry.

51
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,351
Sorry.

52
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,121
FROM SEOUL TO MUEON

53
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,750
Sorry.

54
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,753
Sorry. Please cooperate.

55
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,302
Can I see your face?

56
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,019
Sorry.

57
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,881
YOO YUN-YEONG

58
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,927
Did she tell you to wear her coat
and take her phone?

59
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,264
She's a wanted criminal.

60
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:50,141
-You must cooperate.
-What?

61
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,146
Did she tell you to take the bus to Mueon?

62
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,079
Jeong-won.

63
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:15,917
Jeong-won.

64
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,008
Where are you?

65
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,928
Did you see or hear from Yoo Yun-yeong?

66
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,680
Why? Is something wrong?

67
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,141
She made us think
she was at the bus terminal.

68
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,643
If you're at work, be sure

69
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,062
Yoo Yun-yeong doesn't tail you home, okay?

70
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:38,856
I just got home.

71
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,778
-Is Jeong-won there too?
-Her handbag is.

72
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,241
DETECTIVE KIM TAE-HEON

73
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:49,867
Say Jeong-won's at home.

74
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:53,454
If you don't do as I say, Jeong-won dies.

75
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,127
Is Jeong-won not there?

76
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,551
She's here. She's asleep. I have to go.

77
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,189
Hey, Woo-jae.

78
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,359
-Are you with Jeong-won?
-Yes.

79
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:25,903
Come. I'll text the address.

80
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,574
Come alone, without telling the detective.

81
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:30,867
Or your wife will die.

82
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,785
If you hurt Jeong-won,

83
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,164
I'll kill you and then kill myself too.

84
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:37,915
I made it clear.

85
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:42,336
If you tell or bring anyone,
Seo Jeong-won dies.

86
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:57,351
WOMEN'S TOILET

87
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,770
This is where they swapped coats.

88
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:08,321
This phone is turned off. Please leave…

89
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,573
Jeong-won's phone is off.

90
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,409
Didn't Seol Woo-jae say
she was asleep at home?

91
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,995
She never sleeps at this hour.
I think he lied.

92
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,080
Why would he lie to you about that?

93
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,001
What if he had no choice?

94
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,589
-Thanks.
-Sure.

95
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:39,977
SEOL WOO-JAE

96
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:44,398
The person you are trying to reach
is unavailable…

97
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,529
Who are you?

98
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,116
I'm a detective.

99
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,577
I'd like to see if anyone's in.

100
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,080
-Board Chairman Seol?
-Yes.

101
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:03,251
He drove off in a crazy hurry.

102
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,378
He almost ran someone over.

103
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,672
Was he with his wife, Ms. Seo?

104
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,590
No. He was alone.

105
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:16,180
Something's happened.
Locate Seol Woo-jae's car right now.

106
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,028
Goodness.

107
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,408
What if you roll and fall to your death?

108
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:19,619
What?

109
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:24,582
Are you afraid you'll be stabbed and die
like Jin Myeong-suk and Cha Eun-sae?

110
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,211
Blood makes me squeamish.

111
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,465
That's why I became a psychiatrist.

112
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,766
If you move, I'll push you right away.

113
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,061
I said

114
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,104
we'd go together.

115
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,610
I won't make you lonely.

116
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:55,988
Yun-yeong.

117
00:10:58,407 --> 00:10:59,408
See this?

118
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,619
It stopped at 10:00 p.m.

119
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,830
The current time

120
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,792
is 9:45 p.m.

121
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,085
We have 15 minutes left.

122
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,420
Don't do this.

123
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,178
You know that

124
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:24,183
I stopped the victims' watches
at all the murder scenes.

125
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,068
At first, it didn't mean much.

126
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,362
It was just a joke.

127
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,960
But the more I did it,

128
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:54,004
the harder it became to forget the thrill.

129
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,843
Being able to stop someone's time forever.

130
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,138
It made me feel like a god.

131
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,494
To make something go as planned,

132
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,330
everything must be perfect.

133
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,973
Well done, Jeong-won.

134
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,019
It was perfect until then.

135
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,773
Then I got too anxious to have Woo-jae.

136
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:57,776
Guess what?

137
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,529
I wasn't always this obsessed
with Woo-jae.

138
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,824
I lost control after he married you.

139
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,161
Because

140
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,580
you looked so amazing on TV.

141
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,041
You looked so righteous,

142
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,710
and you always did what was right.

143
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,260
So I actually felt uneasy.

144
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,931
That you'd call the police
as soon as you found Eun-sae dead.

145
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:34,271
Do you know how grateful I was
that you did what I wanted?

146
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,492
Now, there's only one thing I want.

147
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,621
Making sure Woo-jae
remembers me every hour,

148
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,706
every minute, every second.

149
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,210
Remembering me until the day he dies.

150
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,422
It'll only be possible if we die together.

151
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:03,884
Did you call

152
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,554
Woo-jae here?

153
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,616
Of course.

154
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,410
To make my last night perfect,

155
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,579
I need Woo-jae to watch the whole thing.

156
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,916
If he sees us die together,

157
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,462
he will follow us.

158
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,839
He might not do that.

159
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,507
Woo-jae

160
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,176
can be scarier than me.

161
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,766
I'll let you in on a secret.

162
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,895
I'll tell you what Woo-jae has done.

163
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,003
Stop.

164
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:22,922
Don't come closer.

165
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,549
If you take one more step,

166
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:28,969
I'll jump right away.

167
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,310
Then Seo Jeong-won will fall with me.

168
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,024
Okay.

169
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,568
I won't move.

170
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,406
You came here alone,
just like I told you to.

171
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,367
I'll do whatever you want.

172
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,788
I'll give you everything I have.
Money or whatever you want.

173
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,164
Now you're saying that?

174
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:01,085
Even so, I'll rot in prison
for the rest of my life.

175
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,716
Please stop this.

176
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,302
Let's all go down safely.

177
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,807
If I leave Korea

178
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,060
and land in a different country,

179
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,020
will you come for me?

180
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,240
Okay.

181
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,410
I'll do that.

182
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,126
Woo-jae.

183
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,005
I won't fall for that anymore.

184
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,590
Stop deceiving your wife now.

185
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,718
Tell her the truth.

186
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:54,304
If you can't, should I do it for you?

187
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,450
Soo-rin wasn't the one who killed

188
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,744
Cha Eun-sae.

189
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,539
It was your husband.

190
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,507
The truth you were looking for…

191
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,641
Woo-jae,

192
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,518
watch what happens

193
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,814
to the women who loved you

194
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:47,900
in the end.

195
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:29,066
Let go!

196
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,197
Let go!

197
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,838
It's over, Yoo Yun-yeong.

198
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,298
Give up now.

199
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,760
I'm sorry.

200
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,768
I failed,

201
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,646
but I have no regrets.

202
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:19,950
No!

203
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,009
Around 10:00 p.m. yesterday,

204
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,053
Yoo Yun-yeong voluntarily jumped off

205
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:24,264
a building in Myeongsan-gu, Seoul,
and died.

206
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,725
In addition to being suspected
of instigating

207
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:30,437
Cha Eun-sae's murder as well as the murder
of Mo Hyeong-taek's housekeeper,

208
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,731
Yoo Yun-yeong was suspected
of committing arson

209
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,274
at Bongto Factory in 2009.

210
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,152
Due to these suspicions,
she was on the wanted list.

211
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:41,156
When the police were canvassing,
Lieutenant Kim from Gangha Police Station

212
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,116
received a tip that the suspect,

213
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,619
Yoo Yun-yeong, was at a building
in Myeongsan-gu.

214
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:49,122
By the time he got there,
the suspect was trying to end her life…

215
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,756
It's all because of my dad.

216
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,802
My dad killed her.

217
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,265
I won't forgive him. Never.

218
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,273
Gosh.

219
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,234
He hasn't budged for an hour.

220
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,486
It's quite cold out here.

221
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,405
His knees must hurt a lot.

222
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:29,663
-She came out.
-What?

223
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,623
-She came out.
-There she is.

224
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,380
Don't interfere with my business.
Just leave!

225
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,966
I know that your restaurant
opens at 3:00 p.m.

226
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,176
I'll leave before then.

227
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,137
This isn't going to change anything!

228
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:49,349
It doesn't change the fact that you
framed my brother as the arsonist

229
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:52,311
when it was your daughter
who committed the crime!

230
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,855
It wasn't intentional, I swear.

231
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:58,025
Back then,
we had to investigate your brother

232
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,943
due to some circumstantial evidence.

233
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,572
But even if there was,

234
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:08,076
misjudging your brother as the arsonist
is clearly my fault.

235
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,121
I will live the rest of my life
in repentance.

236
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,301
CHA EUN-SAE'S MURDER CASE

237
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,234
Gosh.

238
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:44,196
At last. I can't believe
we got to close this case.

239
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,322
Feels good, right?

240
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,910
I hope she can put this behind her.

241
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,886
AE-NA

242
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:10,889
REPORTER JOO YEONG-SEOK

243
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:57,310
The one who killed Cha Eun-sae

244
00:23:58,436 --> 00:23:59,771
was your husband.

245
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,109
The truth you were looking for…

246
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:07,988
is hidden in your favorite object.

247
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:12,325
Why did she say that?

248
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,923
My favorite object? What could it be?

249
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,034
DIVORCE APPLICATION

250
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,120
SEOUL FAMILY COURT

251
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,293
Let's get a divorce.

252
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,758
A while ago, I moved back in

253
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,553
and said I wanted
to give you another chance.

254
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:58,473
I didn't mean it.

255
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:02,811
I thought you were the killer,
so I decided to stay to dig deeper.

256
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:08,275
Watching you struggle to go back
to the way things were…

257
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,277
I did feel sorry for you,

258
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,279
but that was it.

259
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:16,199
While filling out this application,

260
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,452
I looked back on the times
we spent together.

261
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:23,581
I only wanted to remember the good times,

262
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:26,918
but the painful memories

263
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,421
kept popping into my mind.

264
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,299
When I found Cha Eun-sae's body,

265
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:36,052
when I found out you cheated on me,

266
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,764
and the time when I nearly died
with Yoo Yun-yeong.

267
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:45,603
Now,

268
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:50,191
the miserable memories we share
certainly outnumber

269
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:52,902
our happy memories.

270
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:55,488
Let's not make

271
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,033
each other miserable anymore.

272
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,582
There must be a reason I didn't die

273
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,251
with Yoo Yun-yeong.

274
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,047
I want to start afresh

275
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,341
as if I've been reborn.

276
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,511
Please let me do that.

277
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:21,222
Fine, let's get a divorce.

278
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,185
But can we spend some time apart first?

279
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,354
I'll move out.

280
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,607
-I need some time to process this.
-No.

281
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,691
I'll move out.

282
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:34,861
-I don't want to stay here.
-Where will you stay?

283
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:36,237
I'll stay with Ae-na

284
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:38,531
until I get my own place.

285
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:46,581
I'll come by later to get my things.

286
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,876
Call me once you fill out the papers.

287
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:57,884
Jeong-won.

288
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:41,761
Hey.

289
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:47,308
I understand that
you want to get drunk today,

290
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,185
but slow down.

291
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:52,605
Don't you feel bad for me?
Don't take my beer away from me.

292
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,736
You decided to get a divorce and move out.

293
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:58,987
Don't act pitifully.

294
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:03,283
So, how do you feel now that
you really are getting a divorce?

295
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,245
I feel like…

296
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,207
I'm a nobody now.

297
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:16,963
I married him thinking

298
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,507
I'd never find another man
who loved me that much,

299
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,469
but being called

300
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:28,057
a magnate's daughter-in-law
and an artist's wife wasn't so bad either.

301
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:32,812
But more importantly, it was really nice

302
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:34,606
to have a family.

303
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:40,111
If I still had a solid career
as a reporter, I'd try to hold out.

304
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,281
My gosh.

305
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:45,992
I was arrested

306
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:48,787
and my show got canceled,

307
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,874
so I'll get fired for sure.

308
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,754
On top of that, my marriage failed too,

309
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:01,925
so I can't help but feel
so pathetic and small.

310
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,095
What's gotten into you?

311
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:09,516
You rarely talk about what's on your mind,

312
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,602
but you're telling me
everything you're thinking.

313
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:17,232
The same goes for asking me
if you could stay with me for a few days.

314
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:20,360
Hey,

315
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:25,532
why is it that I hate it so much
when I feel alone?

316
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:27,325
Hey, you aren't alone.

317
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:30,161
You have me,
and you have Detective Kim too.

318
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:36,835
Gosh, I don't know.

319
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,588
Hey, be honest.

320
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:44,092
You were afraid you'd want to go to him
if you were alone,

321
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:45,927
so you came here, right?

322
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:27,552
REPORTER SEO JEONG-WON

323
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:32,974
What are you up to?

324
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,518
I was debating whether or not

325
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,645
to call you.

326
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,230
I have a favor to ask.

327
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,649
You should never ask for favors
over the phone.

328
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,110
You must do it in person.

329
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,195
I need to ask you something too.

330
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:48,990
Let's meet now.

331
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:01,252
I was wondering
why you were with Ms. Yang at this hour.

332
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,795
I guess you've been drinking.

333
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,090
So? What do you need?

334
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,344
When you searched
Yoo Yun-yeong's home and office,

335
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,638
you found recordings
of my sessions with her.

336
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:14,724
Can you send me the files?

337
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:17,060
-Why do you need them?
-There's one last thing

338
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,437
I want to check.

339
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:23,232
Okay, sure.

340
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,237
And what's your question?

341
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:31,240
What's your plan?

342
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:33,910
Your program got canceled,

343
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:36,162
and the journalist association
expelled you.

344
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:38,581
You lost your job

345
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,084
and your husband too.

346
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:48,299
I was being too nosy.
Pretend you didn't hear that.

347
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,100
Tomorrow,

348
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,769
I'll hand in my resignation.

349
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:02,939
I don't want to get fired.

350
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,443
And…

351
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,072
I left home.

352
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,118
I asked for a divorce.

353
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:25,294
I think I went back to being a kid.

354
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,257
I wanted to be such a cool adult.

355
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:31,968
You're not a kid.

356
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:33,803
You came this far.

357
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,764
There's not much to being a cool adult.

358
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,892
You're cool if you get through stuff.

359
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:49,318
I…

360
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:56,784
I feel lost about what I should do
and how I should live from now on.

361
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,457
But I'll get through it a day at a time.

362
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,586
That's the only way
to get back on my feet.

363
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,548
Until everything's sorted out,

364
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:13,551
I'll be cautious.

365
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,806
Can you do the same?

366
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,654
I don't know how long it'll take.

367
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:38,659
But will you

368
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,745
wait for me?

369
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,422
Don't make me wait too long.

370
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,660
She doesn't have fever.

371
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:23,746
Jeong-won.

372
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,126
I just feel a bit achy.

373
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:34,632
I made bean sprout soup.
Have some, and take today off.

374
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:35,967
You can resign tomorrow.

375
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,221
If I put it off,

376
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:42,640
I'll become more reluctant.

377
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,977
I won't take long to get ready.
Let's go together.

SEO JEONG-WON

379
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,324
You're too diligent for your own good.

380
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:03,035
You're not officially dismissed yet.

381
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,454
Exactly. Why must you resign?

382
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,957
Why is she so darn stubborn?

383
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,627
You can have this.

384
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:17,925
You wanted this, right? Here.

385
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,219
Goodness.

386
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:23,681
You value your pride too much.
You should stay as long as you can.

387
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,726
I could try,
but I'll get fired within the week.

388
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,978
I don't want to wither away,

389
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,522
wondering when my last day will be.

390
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,318
We…

391
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:39,030
We fought quite a lot, didn't we?

392
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:43,492
Why are you going down memory lane
like we'll never meet again?

393
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:47,121
You should've snuck in
and packed your stuff at night.

394
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:50,625
Do you have to sour the mood
first thing in the morning?

395
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,670
I don't have anything to give you.

396
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,925
I'll give you the list of stories
I wanted to report on.

397
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,594
I won't take anything less than a scoop.

398
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:03,137
The scar Mo Hyeong-taek

399
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:06,390
says he got
when his daughter attacked him,

400
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:10,353
Mo Soo-rin insists
her father made that up.

401
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:15,233
-Are you sure?
-If that's true, this could take him down.

402
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:19,153
Are you saying
we should believe a serial killer?

403
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:22,365
The whole country knows
Mo Soo-rin's a psychopath.

404
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,659
Not even the police will believe it.

405
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:28,037
I'm not telling you to believe it.
Look into it with suspicion.

406
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:32,667
See you.

407
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:08,452
The chairman is waiting to see you.

408
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:15,584
You were humiliated and dishonored,
so you can no longer report.

409
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:18,713
And you don't have the temperament
to stay at home.

410
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:23,259
Start work next week in Public Relations.

411
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:25,469
Father,

412
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,139
I moved out.

413
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:30,975
I asked for a divorce.

414
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:35,062
I'm waiting until Woo-jae's ready.

415
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,650
You won't sue, then?

416
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,361
-No.
-The terms of divorce…

417
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,405
Can Woo-jae make up the list?

418
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:45,990
Yes.

419
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:49,869
I'll agree to the conditions
you and Woo-jae want.

420
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:55,249
You must sign a confidentiality agreement,
and a contract that limits the alimony.

421
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,500
I'll do that.

422
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:01,172
People go against their word all the time.

423
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,176
What you just agreed to…

424
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,094
RECORDING

425
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:15,978
I will not sue.

426
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,689
I will follow the conditions of divorce.

427
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:19,690
I'll also sign

428
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:22,860
a confidentiality agreement
and a contract.

429
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:36,499
I'd like to go now.

430
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,753
I'm sorry

431
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:45,341
for causing you distress
due to my shortcomings.

432
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:15,996
Jeong-won.

433
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:20,751
Are you okay?

434
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,134
You quit your job?

435
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:29,635
Yes.

436
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,023
What was the rush?

437
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:44,692
You could've

438
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:47,445
let me talk to…

439
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:50,781
You're very pale.

440
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:53,284
I'll take you home.

441
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:19,852
Jeong-won.

442
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,231
Jeong-won.

443
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:27,693
Jeong-won.

444
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,154
Jeong-won.

445
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:33,991
Jeong-won.

446
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:35,951
Jeong-won.

447
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:42,374
Dr. Park, please report to Room 112.

448
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,879
Dr. Park, please report to Room 112.

449
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:54,136
She's suffering from dehydration
due to overwork and stress,

450
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,554
so she lost consciousness.

451
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,141
She's all right for now, so don't worry.

452
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:02,811
Even so, once she wakes up,
I want her to have a full medical checkup.

453
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,147
Sure. I'll coordinate
with the other departments.

454
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,232
Other departments?

455
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,401
Are you not aware of her condition?

456
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:36,262
Are you all right?

457
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:41,183
Right before Yun-yeong died,
what was the last thing she said?

458
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,686
That she failed,
but she didn't have any regrets.

459
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:46,230
Woo-jae wasn't the only one she loved.

460
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,359
She loved me more than him.

461
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,112
That's what she told me.

462
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:55,781
She said I was
the most precious person in her life.

463
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,576
And that I came first.

464
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:04,331
I already told you about her
the other day--

465
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,750
She didn't directly say that to you.

466
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:10,170
There's no way she betrayed me.

467
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,089
I

468
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:14,466
trust her.

469
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:20,472
Why are you pleading the Fifth?
Why are you not cooperating?

470
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:21,974
The longer you keep this up,

471
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,059
the worse this will be for you.

472
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:26,020
I really didn't stab my dad.

473
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,105
Please believe me.

474
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:31,900
Do you know what kind of monster he is?

475
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:37,072
He framed Park Jin-su as the arsonist
even when he knew I started the fire.

476
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:42,036
Please expose the truth about him.
I can't let him get away with this.

477
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:44,038
You feel wronged?

478
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:47,249
I didn't stab him.
Of course, I feel wronged.

479
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,584
Don't you think

480
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:52,796
the victims who died at the factory
feel more wronged?

481
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:55,966
Plus Jin Myeong-suk and Cha Eun-sae.

482
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:01,013
The victims' human rights
are more important than a criminal's.

483
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:03,098
So don't you just say
that you feel wronged.

484
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:05,142
You don't have the right to say that.

485
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:11,857
There's something I didn't tell you

486
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:15,319
regarding the fire incident.

487
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:22,368
14 YEARS AGO

488
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,249
What are you doing?

00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,946
This is Soo-rin.

491
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,448
You're at the factory, right?

492
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:05,160
I have something to tell you,
so meet me at the factory.

493
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:14,670
After witnessing what you did,

494
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:17,631
I had to tell our teacher
because animal abuse is a crime.

495
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:40,404
The fire incident can't be seen
as a silly prank by 19-year-olds.

496
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:43,282
Twelve people died,
and two people were injured.

497
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:45,325
And those two victims died in the end.

498
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:48,078
If Lee Na-ri were still alive,

499
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:51,707
she would have been the same age as you
and enjoying her life.

500
00:45:58,046 --> 00:45:59,131
Detective Kim,

501
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,928
I don't think Na-ri died that night.

502
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,787
Isn't this splendid?

503
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:33,749
We created those flames.

504
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,043
Right.

505
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,136
You saw her running away?

506
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:52,059
Are you sure it was Lee Na-ri?

507
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:54,269
It was a while ago, so I can't be certain.

508
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:56,980
But I was certain
that it was Na-ri back then.

REPORTER SEO JEONG-WON

510
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:23,924
The number you have dialed
is currently unavailable…

511
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,565
What happened?

512
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:42,025
You woke up for a moment
and went back to sleep.

513
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:45,821
Why did you push yourself
to the point of fainting?

514
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:54,705
You need to have
a couple of thorough exams.

515
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:57,874
That's not necessary.
I don't have a job to work hard at now.

516
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,876
I'm not asking just for your sake.

517
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:02,337
Remember what you said?

518
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:06,883
There had to be a reason
why you survived instead of dying.

519
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:13,640
You were right.

520
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:16,435
You and I…

521
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,355
are going to be parents.

522
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:24,651
I couldn't believe it,
so I asked multiple times.

523
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:27,404
After hearing the news yesterday,

524
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:32,451
my heart felt like it would explode,
so I looked up at the sky.

525
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:36,496
Then I finally realized how it felt
when people said they didn't know

526
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:38,665
whether to cry or laugh.

527
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:42,210
It brought tears to my eyes.

528
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:45,672
I was so emotional.

529
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:48,759
I couldn't control my emotions.

530
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:03,482
I was determined to do
what you asked of me.

531
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:05,525
I even filled out the divorce papers.

532
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:10,489
How can I let you go now that I know
you're carrying my child?

533
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:15,410
I know that you're probably sick of me
asking you to stay.

534
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,621
I even hate myself for it, but I…

535
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:23,960
I want to be a good father.

536
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:34,054
Let me be clear.

537
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:35,972
Nothing will change.

538
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:39,935
If you don't agree to a divorce,
I'll file a divorce suit.

539
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:04,751
No…

540
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:07,671
What am I going to do?

541
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,310
What do I do?

542
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:35,824
REPORTER SEO JEONG-WON

543
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:37,325
Why can't I reach her?

544
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:38,869
Tae-heon.

545
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,455
I asked Detective Bong.

546
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:44,249
Like Mo Soo-rin said,
they hired part-timers that day,

547
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:46,001
so the headcount wasn't accurate.

548
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:47,252
What about Lee Na-ri's body?

549
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:48,754
That's odd too.

550
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:51,256
The corpse was too damaged for a DNA test.

551
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:54,968
This is going to bother me even more now.

552
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:58,513
But if Lee Na-ri
had escaped from the factory,

553
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:00,223
she would have gone to her family.

554
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:02,350
It makes no sense
that she just went missing.

555
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:05,395
Even Detective Bong said
Mo Soo-rin must have been mistaken.

556
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:10,233
I should contact Lee Na-ri's family
who emigrated out of Korea.

557
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:13,111
I'd like to eat top-grade Korean beef
for dinner today.

558
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:15,113
What?

559
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:16,948
Did you get enough intel?

560
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:23,246
It's Lee's brother next to her.
Guess who he is now.

561
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:26,374
I found this picture

562
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:29,085
at Zeus' house, right in his house.
You know?

563
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:35,425
Are you saying this boy is Lee Ba-reun?

564
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:37,427
Turns out, Lee Ba-reun
is Lee Na-ri's brother.

565
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:39,679
I already checked
his family relation certificate.

566
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:40,806
I did good, right?

567
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:46,478
Hey, I'm off.

568
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:53,068
Hey, Jeong-won.

569
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:56,238
My gosh. You still look so pale.

570
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:58,532
Did you have dinner?

571
00:51:58,615 --> 00:51:59,658
Yes, I've eaten.

572
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:01,493
My goodness.

573
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:04,162
You filed for divorce and moved out.

574
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,374
Did you have to faint
in front of your husband?

575
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:11,545
Gosh, why is marriage so complicated?

576
00:52:13,129 --> 00:52:15,298
I'm not sure how you'll take this,

577
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:17,884
but for some strange reason,

578
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:21,596
I feel like you and Woo-jae
won't split up after all.

579
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:25,475
Did Woo-jae tell you something?

580
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:27,435
What?

581
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:33,692
It's Detective Kim.

582
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:35,652
Ae-na.

583
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:38,780
-It's been a while.
-Jeong-won is inside, right?

584
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,782
I guess she wasn't expecting you.

585
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:41,950
Come on in.

586
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:44,578
Hey, I couldn't reach you.

587
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,038
I had a busy day.

588
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,790
Why? Aren't you unemployed now?

589
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:54,754
Here, it's what you asked for.

590
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:58,675
You said you wanted the recordings
of your sessions.

591
00:52:58,758 --> 00:52:59,759
Here.

592
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:02,304
Thanks.

593
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:04,347
I'm going to have a beer.

594
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:06,266
Do you want one too, Detective Kim?

595
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:07,767
You too, Jeong-won?

596
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:12,731
Gosh, what was I thinking?

597
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:14,649
You fainted.

598
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:15,817
She fainted?

599
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:21,823
Jeong-won drank too much yesterday.

600
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:23,241
She blacked out.

601
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:27,454
Well, if you drove here,
you can't have a beer.

602
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:28,914
Do you want something else?

603
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:31,917
No, I'm good.
I'm just here to talk about Lee Ba-reun.

604
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:33,793
Wait.

605
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:35,545
What is it?

606
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:37,923
Can I hear it too?

607
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:44,054
You need to see this.

608
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:50,644
Lee Ba-reun is Lee Na-ri's brother.

609
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:58,151
That's why he was
looking into Mo Hyeong-taek.

610
00:53:58,234 --> 00:53:59,361
He knew

611
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:02,197
there was a secret behind the fire case.

612
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,531
The problem is

613
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:06,284
that Mo Soo-rin thinks she saw Lee Na-ri

614
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:08,620
running away from the fire.

615
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:12,999
So Lee Na-ri didn't die in the fire?

616
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,252
My gosh.

617
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:19,881
If Ba-reun finds out about this,
he'll be utterly shocked.

618
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,509
But if Lee Na-ri didn't die back then,

619
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:25,095
how come no one has seen her since then?

620
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,181
Even if she managed to escape,
she probably died

621
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:30,725
because of the toxic gases
or some other reason.

622
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,894
I know. I don't think she's alive.

623
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:35,981
But if she really escaped,
like Mo Soo-rin said,

624
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:39,150
and if her body still hasn't been found,

625
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:41,736
we can't ignore the possibility
of another crime.

626
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:46,366
First, we're going to contact her parents
in Canada to look for Lee Ba-reun.

627
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:48,618
If you hear from him, let me know.

628
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:50,245
You too, Ms. Yang. Okay?

629
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:51,371
Yes, of course.

630
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:54,124
I hope Ba-reun hears this soon.

631
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,167
Hey, you look tired.

632
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,755
-I'll be off, then.
-You're leaving?

633
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:03,883
Hey, he's leaving.

634
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:09,305
You won't see me out?

635
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:11,224
Hey, go.

636
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:34,539
This isn't being careful.
You're being so cold to me.

637
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:39,586
Do you know what this reminds me of?

638
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:42,839
You're acting just like
when we reunited after three years.

639
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:47,844
How did you change in just a few days?
Did I do something wrong?

640
00:55:51,347 --> 00:55:52,390
No.

641
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:55,226
My gosh. This will only make me
more impatient.

642
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:58,063
Forget being careful.

643
00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:00,023
I want to just carry you on my back

644
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,067
and elope with you.

645
00:56:11,993 --> 00:56:13,036
Something happened.

646
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:16,247
No, nothing happened.

647
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:25,215
It's your father's
death anniversary tomorrow.

648
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:30,887
You always put cheesecake on his memorial.

649
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:35,433
It was this time of year. I remember now.

650
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:42,232
Are you feeling down because
you've been thinking of your father?

651
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,737
I won't ask for anything else.

652
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:52,575
Just pick up when I call you. All right?

653
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,578
I'm just worried about you.

654
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,251
I'm off.

655
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,960
You can hear the heart beating, right?

656
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:48,756
The baby is healthy. No issues.

657
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:53,845
Doctor?

658
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:55,638
Yes.

659
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,474
Can I

660
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,101
still get an abortion?

661
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:57,492
Well done.

662
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:59,369
-I'll see you next week.
-All right.

663
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:06,709
That book, didn't your husband write it?

664
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:09,420
That's right.

665
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:12,882
I read it too.

666
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:15,969
It wasn't my cup of tea.

667
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:17,929
Really?

668
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:22,433
But I guess you liked it,
seeing how you carry it around.

669
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,060
DESIRE
SEOL WOO-JAE

670
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:26,396
It's my favorite one
out of all the novels.

671
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:28,398
I started reading it again.

672
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:40,368
"I failed, but I have no regrets

673
00:59:40,451 --> 00:59:44,163
because it was my dream, my love
and my innocent desire."

674
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:48,793
I must say though,
I really liked this sentence at the end.

675
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:50,837
I failed,

676
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:53,381
but I have no regrets.

677
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:06,519
DESIRE

678
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,752
OCTOBER 6TH, 2023, 7:15 P.M.

679
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:47,662
It was the exact same knife.

680
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:51,249
The man who killed Cha Eun-sae

681
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:53,835
killed my father too.

682
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:55,021
You said you were drinking in your studio
at the time of Cha Eun-sae's death.

683
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:56,147
Why are you asking that?

684
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:58,775
I thought I'd never have a grandchild.

685
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:01,486
I will raise my child well
with only the best things.

686
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:03,571
I will put the past behind me now.

687
01:03:04,071 --> 01:03:07,283
There's a reason I dragged you into this.

688
01:03:07,366 --> 01:03:09,494
I met your father.

689
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:12,830
Jeong-won has changed.
Didn't you sense it?

690
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:15,291
I've had a change of heart.

691
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:17,210
Forget everything.

692
01:03:18,085 --> 01:03:20,213
Help me so I don't have to suffer so much.
