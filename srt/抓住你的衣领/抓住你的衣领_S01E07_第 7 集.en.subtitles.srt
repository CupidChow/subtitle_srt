1
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:49,382
ALL LOCATIONS, PEOPLE, ORGANIZATIONS,
INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,519
Detective Kim Tae-heon. Right?

3
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,021
How do you know me?

4
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:06,649
You visited my clinic to check
Ms. Seo's appointment records.

5
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,194
I saw your face on the security footage.

6
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,202
A detective is paying you a visit,

7
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,081
but you don't seem flustered at all.

8
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:27,378
I knew you'd visit eventually

9
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:31,132
because Ms. Cha Eun-sae
was my patient too.

10
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,805
From 5:00 to 8:00 p.m. on October 6th,

11
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,723
where were you?

12
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,141
October…

13
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:44,229
-That was the day when Eun-sae died?
-Yes.

14
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:45,855
I was at the clinic.

15
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,399
You were at the clinic, alone?

16
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:51,319
That means you can't prove your alibi.

17
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,533
If you can't find the culprit,

18
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,409
create one.

19
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:06,584
Create a culprit? Is that something to say

20
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,129
to your journalist daughter-in-law?

21
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:12,841
If that's too much,
how about this suggestion, then?

22
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:16,845
Why not join my company
and work in Public Relations?

23
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,140
This is what you were after.

24
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,517
I joined the company.

25
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,396
You can bother me,
but leave Jeong-won alone.

26
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,566
Let's go. This is nonsense.

27
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:31,568
Sit down.

28
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:51,254
Mujin Construction got this far
because Mueon Resort was a success.

29
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:54,591
With the aim of opening in 2028,

30
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,718
I'll embark on a new project,

31
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,845
which is a resort complex.

32
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:03,141
If my heir is involved
in a murder investigation--

33
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:06,936
That would hurt you the most
because the new project could collapse.

34
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,355
The public sentiment online is very bad.

35
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,815
My men are working on it,

36
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,109
but everyone already believes
you're killers,

37
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,611
and our stock is plummeting!

38
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,455
There's a reason
journalists get into Public Relations.

39
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:29,459
I'd like you to use your network, sources

40
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,753
and crisis management skills
for Mujin Group.

41
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,423
I gave my word as a journalist

42
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,384
that I'd reveal the culprit on my show.

43
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:44,432
What if I were to expose you
for pretending to defend your husband

44
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,975
because of our deal?

45
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:50,104
Truth is everything to a journalist.

46
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,273
If people were to know you lied to them,

47
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:55,109
what good would your word be?

48
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,154
Father, please!

49
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,121
Must you go this far?

50
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:20,218
This is the CCTV footage
from the waiting room that day.

51
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,430
On that day, I left for a while.

52
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,394
I returned at this time. And then…

53
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,734
At 8:35 p.m. I went home.

54
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:43,032
What did you do when you were out
between 4:35 and 5:50 p.m.?

55
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,327
I was at a nearby cafe.

56
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:49,580
Were you there alone
or did you have company?

57
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,082
I was with a friend.

58
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,834
Can you tell me who that is?

59
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,796
Do I have to tell you?

60
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,382
It's not an obligation.

61
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,807
It's not an obligation
to submit the footage,

62
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,226
but can you give me a copy?

63
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,352
Yes.

64
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,187
I will.

65
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,527
I'm sorry.

66
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:25,033
I can't drive you back to work.
I need to talk to my father.

67
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,953
Don't argue with your father
because of me.

68
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,415
But I don't want you in trouble.

69
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,127
See you at home.

70
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,288
A few days ago,

71
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,667
I relapsed and took drugs again.

72
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,922
Before you expose the truth
about Jeong-won,

73
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:23,466
I might expose the truth about my--

74
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:36,437
The risk I carry is greater than
that of the online sentiment.

75
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,606
Don't forget that.

76
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,317
You have money and power,

77
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,903
and your only weapon
is to damage yourself?

78
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,412
I need to destroy me
to destroy you, Father.

79
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,250
My wife, Jeong-won,

80
00:06:58,709 --> 00:06:59,669
leave her alone.

81
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,798
Unless you want to see me self-destruct.

82
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,137
Sorry for ruining your musical experience.

83
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,112
I looked into Yoo Yun-yeong.

84
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,864
It was pretty boring.

85
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,284
She likes designer bags
and going to clubs.

86
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,536
There's nothing newsworthy?

87
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,037
There's no weakness,

88
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:36,789
but there is something.

89
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,042
Her clinic's registered
in someone else's name.

90
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,210
Mo Soo-rin.

91
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:44,589
-Mo Soo-rin?
-So I looked her up.

92
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:46,799
She's Mo Hyeong-taek's daughter.

93
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,302
Good job.

94
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,391
MO HYEONG-TAEK

95
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,019
Yes. 14 years ago,

96
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,480
Mo's daughter would've been in Mueon too.

97
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,982
DAUGHTER: MO SOO-RIN (32)

98
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,944
They're the same age.
Did they go to school together?

99
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:11,365
Yoo Yun-yeong, who on earth are you?

100
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,336
Wasn't this your favorite drink?

101
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,340
I think

102
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,343
the scariest people in the world

103
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,137
are journalists.

104
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,020
With one scoop,

105
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:44,232
they manipulate what people see and hear.

106
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,609
You take down presidents

107
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,861
and rewrite history.

108
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,864
I don't know what history
you want to rewrite,

109
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:56,410
but I don't drink that liquor anymore.

110
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,915
I know very well that you've changed.

111
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,210
I'm not asking for a cover-up.

112
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,464
But it's okay to ask you
to expose something, no?

113
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,852
The timeline doesn't seem edited.

114
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,355
Everything else seems fine too.

115
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,246
-Hi.
-Hey.

116
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:43,332
Someone from his job
reported that Kim is the culprit.

117
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,001
A search warrant was issued.

118
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,586
What?

119
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,821
You said you lost your phone last time.

120
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,031
You hadn't.

121
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,397
-Detective Oh.
-What?

122
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,242
-What's that?
-Mr. Kim Min-cheol.

123
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:03,496
You're under arrest
for the murder of Cha Eun-sae.

124
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,540
What…

125
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:11,587
Ms. Choi,

126
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,924
does someone called Mo Soo-rin
see Dr. Yoo too?

127
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,970
The day after tomorrow? What time?

128
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:27,103
Can you move my appointment
to the time slot after hers?

129
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,236
The illegal photos on the phone alone…

130
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,198
can get you locked up.

131
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,120
You wrote this comment, no?

132
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,788
I'M CHA'S BABY'S FATHER

133
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,333
Whether you are or not,
the results will tell.

134
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:54,713
On your laptop, we found proof
that you stalked Cha.

135
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,091
Don't lie to me that you were just a fan.

136
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,927
Yes, I admit that I took pics…

137
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,890
wrote hate comments and stalked Eun-sae.

138
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,935
But I didn't kill Eun-sae.

139
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:15,109
I emailed you the information
about Detective Kim.

140
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:33,085
She kept ignoring me as if I didn't exist.

141
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:37,548
That's why I stabbed that wench,
Cha Eun-sae, to death.

142
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,678
You already confessed to the murder.

143
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:44,430
You think you can get away now?

144
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:47,933
That? I was drunk, so I was lying.

145
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:51,103
I left that comment because I was drunk.

146
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,147
And you killed her drunk?

147
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:57,151
No! Why would I kill Eun-sae?
I loved her so much!

148
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,028
The knife I found.

149
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,530
Why did you hide that then?

150
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,117
Detective,

151
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,536
that knife doesn't belong to me.

152
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,371
I'm telling the truth.

153
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,092
Sir.

154
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,098
I came too late.

155
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:40,986
Do you want a drink?

156
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,739
Someone you know very well

157
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,076
has been arrested for the murder of Cha.

158
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,537
Who?

159
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,456
-Is it…
-Kim Min-cheol.

160
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,168
I see.

161
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:59,255
Not who you were thinking?

162
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,257
It's not that.

163
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:06,262
Why did you lend money
to Kim Min-cheol that day?

164
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,264
Because he blackmailed me.

165
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:10,766
Blackmail?

166
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,395
He knew that I was seeing Cha.

167
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,648
He wanted ten million won
per month for silence.

168
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,191
How did Kim know about this?

169
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,818
He was Cha Eun-sae's stalker.

170
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:26,240
I doubt that they arrested him
on stalking charges.

171
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,787
Did something bad happen?

172
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:36,917
No.

173
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:39,795
Let's leave together.

174
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,423
Go home without me.

175
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,008
I have to work.

176
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,218
Then…

177
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,430
you'll go meet the detective in charge?

178
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:56,520
You lied about losing your phone.

179
00:14:56,604 --> 00:15:00,107
You also lied
that you didn't stalk Cha Eun-sae.

180
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,776
That means everything
you told me last time

181
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,321
was a lie.

182
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:12,661
Borrowing money
from Seol Woo-jae was a lie too. Right?

183
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,581
You didn't borrow, you blackmailed.

184
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,250
You knew about his affair with Cha.

185
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,671
I…

186
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:26,675
Tae-heon.

187
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,436
We found Cha Eun-sae's blood on the knife.

188
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,313
Kim is the culprit.

189
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,649
After the DNA test,
let's request a warrant.

190
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,741
I'll work all night. Go to sleep.

191
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:09,176
MUJIN WELFARE FOUNDATION

192
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,696
REPORTER SEO JEONG-WON

193
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:37,037
-Yes.
-Where are you?

194
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,874
-I'm at the station. You?
-I'm on my way there.

195
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,128
Too many reporters. Meet me at my place.

196
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,230
Let's talk inside.

197
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,595
APPLICATION FOR 101 GUARD SERVICE
KIM TAE-HEON

198
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,161
Kim Min-cheol…

199
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,872
why did you arrest him?

200
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,710
My husband told me that

201
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:10,547
he was Cha's stalker
and even blackmailed my husband.

202
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,592
That's not enough to arrest someone.

203
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:18,180
You were tailing someone in Mueon.
Was it Kim Min-cheol?

204
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,684
I went to Yoo's clinic this afternoon.

205
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,021
-Why?
-On the day of Jin's murder,

206
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,857
Yoo's car was caught on
a camera in Owol-dong.

207
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,569
But at the time of Cha's murder,

208
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,947
she was at her clinic.

209
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:40,244
She came into the clinic at 5:50
and left at 8:30 p.m.

210
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,582
You had the same idea.

211
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:51,380
That your husband paid this woman
in the red coat to murder Cha.

212
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,424
Yoo's alibi is airtight.

213
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,301
She's not the culprit.

214
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:02,724
We found a critical piece
of evidence at Kim's house.

215
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:03,892
What a lucky break.

216
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:05,936
This is everything

217
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,064
I can tell you. Nothing else.

218
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,734
Will you request a warrant?

219
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,242
I'll have to be on standby, then.

220
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:22,953
Okay.

221
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,293
Wait, Jeong-won.

222
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,424
This afternoon and just a while ago,

223
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,595
I went to the TV station to see you.

224
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,431
-Why?
-Why did you do it?

225
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,559
Why didn't you explain everything?

226
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,438
You didn't approach me for Detective Cha.

227
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,356
You didn't toy with me. Right?

228
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:58,071
Why didn't you tell me? You said nothing!

229
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:02,284
Had you told me,
we would have never broken up.

230
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,005
I resented you.

231
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,178
You said my feelings were insincere.

232
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:24,973
That made me angry.

233
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,230
That was how you saw me.

234
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,650
And that hurt me.

235
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,990
I wanted to hurt you

236
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,370
as much as you hurt me.

237
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,623
Then you succeeded.

238
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,378
Whenever I see you,

239
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,005
I'm miserable.

240
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,688
I'm sorry.

241
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,774
I criticized you

242
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,194
for never apologizing to me.

243
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,198
But I didn't have that right.

244
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,911
I hurt you.

245
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:36,712
I'm sorry for that.

246
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,624
What are you two doing here?

247
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,420
I'm investigating Kim's--

248
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,464
Do you have to do that at…

249
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,306
At your ex-boyfriend's place?

250
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,607
What a hot mess.

251
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,109
You had to tail your wife?

252
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,237
Let's talk outside.

253
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:50,118
Now, I understand
why your eyes looked so sad.

254
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:54,831
It must've been heartbreaking
to have to question the woman you loved

255
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,167
and to suspect her.

256
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:01,004
It must've been painful,
and you developed sympathy

257
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,256
and feelings for her.

258
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,051
She was married, but you wanted her.

259
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,054
What's with you?

260
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:12,599
For a bad husband, you sure get jealous.

261
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,854
I am warning you
as Seo Jeong-won's husband.

262
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,689
You'd better

263
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,442
stay away from my wife.

264
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:24,027
I don't want to.

265
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:28,782
You cheated on her.

266
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,618
Why can't she cheat?

267
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,037
It's not fair.

268
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,418
So what?

269
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,588
You'll have an affair with my wife?

270
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:44,798
Why not?

271
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:46,967
That's enough.

272
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:48,844
Let's go home, please.

273
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,918
Did you have to tail me?

274
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,505
Did you have to lie to me?

275
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,591
-About what?
-The work trip to Mueon.

276
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,052
You went with him, right?

277
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:35,140
No, I did not. I ran into him in Mueon.

278
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:37,350
You were with him but lied to me about it.

279
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:43,190
How did you find out?

280
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:48,486
That you and Kim dated in the past?

281
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,514
It must've been heartbreaking

282
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,226
to have to question the woman you loved

283
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,435
and to suspect her.

284
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:24,898
It must've been painful,
and you developed sympathy

285
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,233
and feelings for her.

286
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,234
She was married,

287
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,318
but you wanted her.

288
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:41,081
The chairman asked me to investigate you.

289
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:42,874
And I did.

290
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,003
That picture.

291
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:48,880
Where'd you get it?

292
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:55,762
Is that more important to you

293
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:57,681
than me finding out?

294
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,022
When I was chasing you, you told me

295
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,817
that you broke up recently.

296
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:14,114
You'd even considered marrying him
and you weren't over him yet.

297
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,449
But I said that I could make you

298
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:20,036
forget him and asked you to

299
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:23,498
be with me forever.

300
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,711
And Kim Tae-heon was that guy?

301
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:35,385
Why did you two break up
if you loved each other?

302
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:39,347
-It's all in the past.
-Are you sure about that?

303
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:45,562
It wasn't just the way he looked at you.
It was also how you looked at him.

304
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,316
On the terrace

305
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,276
and at his place.

306
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,948
You developed feelings?

307
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:00,535
Like him?

308
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:02,537
Did you?

309
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:06,708
No, right?

310
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,555
Why can't you say anything?

311
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,395
You're making me think that I'm right.

312
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:34,694
It sounds like you're into him.

313
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,698
Tell me it's not true, Jeong-won.

314
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:41,951
Hey.

315
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,371
Please.

316
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:48,875
Let's drop this.

317
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,719
You said your son
and his wife were here today.

318
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,972
Did you throw a glass at them?

319
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,144
What's your plan for the election?

320
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:17,816
Thanks to someone, my image took a hit.

321
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,317
I have to give up on Seoul.

322
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,487
I shall aim for Gyeonggi-do or Incheon.

323
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,324
Why don't you target your own turf?

324
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:28,409
Why should I?

325
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:33,498
I mean, have any governors of Gangwon-do
run for President before?

326
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,668
I should aim for somewhere near Seoul--

327
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,628
If you want funds for your campaign,

328
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,798
there's nothing better
than a new resort in Mujin.

329
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:50,557
So you want to start a new project?

330
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,601
This was your plan.

331
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:57,063
Where in Gangwon-do?

332
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:00,400
Somewhere with easy conversion of land.

333
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,403
I'll keep you posted.

334
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:09,242
Before we collaborate
on a massive business plan,

335
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:10,910
we must go over something.

336
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:16,749
Why are you involved in the Cha case?

337
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,168
Is it the sponsorship?

338
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,133
Please check the amount.

339
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,928
The guy who reported Kim Min-cheol.

340
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:31,431
He just withdrew cash and is on the phone.

341
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:33,558
I wish he were talking to Cha Geum-sae.

342
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:36,144
We can bring him in
for reporting Kim Min-cheol.

343
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,647
Let's find out.

344
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:00,793
What's going on?

345
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:06,549
Sorry.

346
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:09,886
Sorry, I'm a detective.

347
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:12,472
Keep the change. I'll take the passenger.

348
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,015
What's this about?

349
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,141
Get out.

350
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,185
Sorry, sir.

351
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,688
Let me check your phone real quick.

352
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,274
Your phone.

353
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:32,533
CHA GEUM-SAE

354
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:35,912
You know Cha Geum-sae.

355
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,501
Not at the moment, but you did talk often.

356
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:45,213
Cha told you to report Kim, didn't he?

357
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,632
Shall we talk at the station?

358
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,258
No. He told me to do it,

359
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,136
but Min-cheol did say it.

360
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,644
DETECTIVE BONG, MUEON

361
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,274
Detective Bong.

362
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:07,151
I found what you asked for.

363
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,070
I'll send a photo from the junkyard.

364
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,279
Take a look.

365
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,240
Okay. Thanks for your help.

366
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,324
Bye.

367
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,545
It was Mo Hyeong-taek's man

368
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,131
who tailed me in Mueon?

369
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:41,436
Kim was arrested
because someone taped him confessing.

370
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,315
How did the police get the recording?

371
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,817
His colleague reported it.

372
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:51,654
They found a bloody weapon
during the search and seizure.

373
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:52,822
Was it Cha's blood?

374
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,449
He confessed, so it must be.

375
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:57,201
Write up a script for a show.
Let's air it this week.

376
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,205
Once he's arrested, I'll meet my team--

377
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,957
You said you'd name the culprit.

378
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,292
Why delay it now?

379
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,544
Set things up for a special live show.

380
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,796
What if he's not arrested?

381
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,049
-He said he would be…
-Who said?

382
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:15,219
Who do you think?
Someone from the police did.

383
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:18,514
How do you know so much
when they were issued a gag order?

384
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:21,726
Not just me,
but no reporter could get the story.

385
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:24,395
Are you picking a fight? I have my ways.

386
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:30,777
371NA 3386

387
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,323
Yes, sir.

388
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:38,034
I have a long way to go
to catch up to you.

389
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:52,840
There are no cameras.

390
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,397
What are you doing?

391
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:15,738
I'm here to investigate. Why are you here?

392
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:20,451
You found a bloody weapon
at Kim Min-cheol's house.

393
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:21,994
-Said who?
-My chief.

394
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:26,791
Leave.

395
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:31,462
Go away.

396
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,506
Then I'll go through the open window.

397
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,468
You can't take photos.

398
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,856
-It's different.
-What's different?

399
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:51,983
The knife?

400
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,026
He didn't use one from here?

401
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,957
Do you have the results?

402
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:19,594
Where are you going?

403
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:26,184
About our past,
Secretary Gong Jun-ho told your husband.

404
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,854
How do you know that? Do you know him?

405
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,315
I became a cop because of him.

406
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,328
What are you doing here?

407
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:49,832
On Cha Eun-sae's body,
were there any stab wounds?

408
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,127
Were there?

409
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,598
There were self-inflicted wounds.

410
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,183
You found the murder weapon.

411
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:09,143
Why ask about other wounds?

412
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,645
We tested the knife.

413
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,105
It didn't match the lethal wound.

414
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,235
The problem is that her blood
was on the knife.

415
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,694
So I came here.

416
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:20,279
I see.

417
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:23,157
That knife could be
what she used to harm herself.

418
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:27,536
That would explain her blood on it.

419
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,044
It wasn't me, Detective.

420
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:38,089
I didn't kill her.

421
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:44,220
Your balcony window was open.
Do you never lock it?

422
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,973
No. The air circulation's very poor.

423
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:51,644
He's not the killer,
just an illegal photographer.

424
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:52,895
-Tae-heon.
-Follow me.

425
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,356
That punk.

426
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,484
GANGHA POLICE STATION

427
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,955
-What murder?
-What's this?

428
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:13,332
-Darn it.
-I waited for nothing.

429
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,792
WRONGLY SUSPECTED OF MURDER

430
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:18,713
"Police changed the charges
for the man they arrested

431
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:23,759
from murder to breaking the special law
on sexually violent crimes."

432
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,612
You're still the same.

433
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:48,200
Whenever you couldn't arrest someone,
you'd take it out on the poor sandbag.

434
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:53,497
You found a bloody knife,
but he was not the murderer.

435
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:55,958
Was the blood not Cha's?

436
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,294
It was her blood.

437
00:38:58,377 --> 00:38:59,295
Then why?

438
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:01,881
Her blood was on the knife,

439
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:04,383
but it wasn't what killed her?

440
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,805
For her blood to be on it,

441
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:13,059
she must've been hurt with it
or hurt herself with it.

442
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,604
What if the knife was hers?

443
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,898
Without any leads or proof,

444
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,317
we can't make a rash move.

445
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:24,945
I can.

446
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,201
-Where are you going?
-Not even a detective

447
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:33,162
can stop a reporter
from talking to a victim's family.

448
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,054
Oh, well…

449
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:51,931
What you mentioned

450
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:54,517
on the phone.

451
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,060
CHA EUN-SAE, WE LOVE YOU

452
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:18,457
Let's be done in ten minutes.

453
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:21,836
You can't record me. Turn it off.

454
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:37,726
You want to interview me so badly
that you gave me what I wanted?

455
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,353
Because

456
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:44,066
I don't find you guilty,
I gave you proof of the assault.

457
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,234
Who else

458
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,028
do you find guilty?

459
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:53,868
I think Kim Min-cheol's the culprit.
That's the story I'm telling.

460
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:00,875
My husband and he went to the same school.

461
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:04,336
He knew that my husband was seeing Cha,

462
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,922
so he blackmailed him and asked for money.

463
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,425
Really?

464
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:12,136
Kim even admitted
to the murder on recording.

465
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:16,223
The murder weapon was at his house.
He should be charged for murder.

466
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:19,310
I believe the police have made a mistake.

467
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,188
Exactly. You know?

468
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:25,524
It's clear that he's the culprit.
You know?

469
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:30,196
So you also suspect
Kim is the culprit, right?

470
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,073
Well,

471
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,117
I wouldn't say…

472
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:37,995
Mr. Cha Geum-sae.

473
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,789
-Darn it.
-Cha Geum-sae.

474
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,209
To say…

475
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:49,548
MONEY-GRUBBING PIG

476
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:52,927
Have some peanuts.

477
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,601
END CALL

478
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:02,770
Darn it.

479
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:09,985
Come on.

480
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:18,244
It's not the due date yet.

481
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,828
Why are you here again?

482
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:20,996
Here's your bag.

483
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:23,040
We're returning it.

484
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:27,878
Boss wants you to fill it up
with cash again next month.

485
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,548
Gosh. I got it. Just leave.

486
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:34,885
I said I got it.

487
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,471
You should get a new bag or something.
Seriously.

488
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:39,932
It's good for biking.

489
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:41,308
I got it. Just go.

490
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,125
Where did she go?

491
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:11,589
I went to the bathroom.

492
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:15,551
It's been ten minutes.

493
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:22,016
Don't hesitate to contact me
if there's anything about Kim Min-cheol.

494
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,101
Sure. I'll do that.

495
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:00,262
Darn it.

496
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:06,977
Why did you open it without my permission?

497
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,521
How dare you?

498
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,400
-That bag…
-The bag? What about it?

499
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:15,903
What about that bag?

500
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:20,824
Nothing.

501
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:29,917
What?

502
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,753
How on earth did she recognize the bag?

503
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:38,300
Did she…

504
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:53,273
3 MONTHS AGO

505
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:57,319
You're here on the weekend.

506
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,071
I had work.

507
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:00,489
Finished working out?

508
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:02,491
Yes.

509
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:05,828
If I knew you'd be here,
I would've bought something.

510
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:08,288
That's cute.

511
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,835
I can't give you this. It was a gift.

512
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:19,216
It's the same bag
with the same keyring accessory.

513
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:21,260
Could it be a coincidence?

514
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:38,152
Not here. Let's talk somewhere else.

515
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:50,622
The knife from Kim's house

516
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:52,749
is from Cha's house, right?

517
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:58,422
This is Cha Geum-sae's doing.

518
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,967
How did it lead to Kim getting reported?

519
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,344
It can't be a coincidence.

520
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:06,847
He tried to frame Kim Min-cheol
as the culprit.

521
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,515
Did Cha Geum-sae frame Kim

522
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:11,935
because he was the real culprit?

523
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:14,813
That's a possibility.

524
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:18,025
Or Cha Geum-sae could have been used too.

525
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,193
By whom?

526
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:22,488
By Mo Hyeong-taek?

527
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:23,739
I'll look into it.

528
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:29,369
You're a reporter,
but you need to be careful.

529
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,663
What if Cha did it?

530
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:34,333
Then you were alone in the house
with a murderer.

531
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:36,627
I helped you.

532
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:39,838
You're a detective. You should thank me.

533
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,965
You don't know why I'm mad at you?

534
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,186
Anyway,

535
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:56,563
you needed my help.

536
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,154
Tell me if you need me too.

537
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:07,491
I'll help you.

538
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:11,620
Whatever it is.

539
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:20,837
You developed feelings?

540
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:23,298
Why can't you say anything?

541
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:27,010
You're making me think that I'm right.

542
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,933
It sounds like you're into him.

543
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:35,978
No.

544
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,775
Why would you help me?

545
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:44,361
You suspected me not long ago.

546
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:45,779
And now you want to help?

547
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:47,948
Because our past cleared up?

548
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:49,199
Because you feel bad?

549
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:55,414
My husband made a mistake

550
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:58,083
at your house the other day.

551
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,501
You made a mistake too.

552
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:02,754
I understand that
you wanted to mess with him.

553
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:05,299
-But never say that again.
-What?

554
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:07,759
That I'm willing
to have an affair with you?

555
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:11,680
What if it wasn't
to mess with your husband?

556
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,224
What if wasn't guilt?

557
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,311
What if I'm worried?

558
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:22,274
And I want to help?
What would you do then?

559
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,444
Is that not allowed?

560
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,654
But that's how I feel.

561
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:32,868
Can't I just follow my heart?

562
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:43,128
No, never.

563
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:46,923
Don't have any feelings for me.

564
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:01,855
I'm a crazy jerk.

565
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:04,900
I did nothing right.

566
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:26,254
Why did you want to see me?

567
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:28,674
Here.

568
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:32,469
I'll leave after
I finish this drink with you.

569
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:35,472
Cheers.

570
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,350
What is it? What's going on?

571
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,274
Kim Tae-heon figured out

572
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:48,402
that he misunderstood

573
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:51,655
what happened.

574
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:55,409
You're killing me.

575
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,994
You need to quit that habit of yours.

576
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:00,122
If it's not true, you need to say it.

577
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:01,873
Why keep it all bottled up?

578
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:03,834
You're right.

579
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:06,294
Why do I do this?

580
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:09,548
He still has feelings for you, right?

581
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:12,926
His feelings must be growing now.

582
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:21,601
Hey, I can control what I say,

583
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:24,896
so why is it
that I can't control my own thoughts?

584
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:27,649
Now,

585
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:30,485
I pity my husband

586
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:32,779
more than I hate him.

587
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:36,950
Things can't go back to how it was before.

588
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:40,704
I feel bad seeing him
try so desperately to reverse it all.

589
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:42,497
What you just said

590
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,917
makes me think
you have no feelings for Woo-jae.

591
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:50,547
How strange.

592
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,341
I finished drinking, but I feel nothing.

593
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:39,805
I came here to drink your coffee.

594
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:47,479
Fixing broken things,

595
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,273
it's a hobby that suits you.

596
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:52,067
Look.

597
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:57,280
It's more beautiful because it's broken.

598
00:51:57,989 --> 00:51:59,783
Yes, you're right.

599
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:05,664
Something wrong with your dad?

600
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:09,376
He found out everything.

601
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:14,047
He might really kill me at this rate.

602
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:31,815
I promised you

603
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:35,068
that I'd protect you.

604
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:49,666
What would you do without me?

605
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:09,603
Hello.

606
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:13,398
Aren't you Assemblyman Mo's daughter?

607
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:16,359
Yes. Hello.

608
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:19,237
How long have you been coming here?

609
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:23,491
Not long.

610
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:25,952
I see.

611
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,582
The doctor is very nice, isn't she?

612
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:32,584
Yes.

613
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:34,836
I have to get back to my cafe.

614
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,422
Ms. Mo Soo-rin.

615
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:41,134
I want to ask you if I could interview you
regarding Jin's case.

616
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,720
How do you know my name?

617
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:45,889
I looked it up and found it right away.

618
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:48,767
We're the same age.

619
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:52,479
I thought you're working
on Cha Eun-sae's case.

620
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:54,814
I'm closely following both cases.

621
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,859
I'll visit you at your cafe soon.

622
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:11,665
Why is she lying
about her relationship with Yoo?

623
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:26,680
So, Mo Soo-rin is your patient too?

624
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:29,891
You know Ms. Mo Soo-rin?

625
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:32,268
She is Assemblyman Mo's daughter.

626
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:39,067
Cha Eun-sae was your patient too,
wasn't she?

627
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:41,361
I'm sorry,

628
00:54:42,153 --> 00:54:44,072
I cannot confirm that.

629
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:46,032
Had I known Cha was your patient,

630
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:49,327
I would've found a different therapist.

631
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:51,871
The wife and the mistress.

632
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:55,709
How did it feel
to hear both women's thoughts?

633
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:00,755
This feels like…

634
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,092
an interrogation.

635
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:13,977
Come on in.

636
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:23,403
Your husband asked for

637
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:27,532
a marriage counseling session
to patch things up.

638
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:28,867
Is that okay with you?

639
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:34,456
I…

640
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,500
should've been more thoughtful.

641
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:39,836
I should've asked
how you felt about it first.

642
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:42,422
Let's just go.

643
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:47,927
No.

644
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,221
You did this for us.

645
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:52,640
Let's do it.

646
00:55:58,396 --> 00:55:59,439
We'll do it.

647
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:11,076
You made a wise decision.

648
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:13,620
Who wants to go first?

649
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:14,829
I'll go first.

650
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:22,295
Why did you marry Mr. Seol Woo-jae?

651
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:25,799
Because I thought
he'd be on my side forever.

652
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:28,968
You wanted a devoted husband.

653
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:32,972
Before the affair, were you

654
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:35,308
happy with your marriage?

655
00:56:35,391 --> 00:56:36,601
Yes, I was.

656
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:37,852
My career and marriage.

657
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:41,106
I thought I was successful on all fronts.

658
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:46,277
Do you think your husband was as satisfied
as you were?

659
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:48,571
Would you say

660
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:50,949
you were a devoted spouse too?

661
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:53,701
I admit that I could've been better,

662
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:57,413
but that cannot be used
to excuse an affair.

663
00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:00,375
Right, of course not.

664
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:02,460
However,

665
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:05,130
if your career was more important,

666
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:07,966
it's possible what made you angry

667
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:10,885
wasn't his affair
but how it impacted your career.

668
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:15,473
And that could make
your husband miserable.

669
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:21,688
Earlier, I asked you why you married him.

670
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:23,481
Be honest.

671
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:26,609
Didn't you choose him
because of his background?

672
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:29,612
To marry a rich heir?

673
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:32,490
You are out of line.

674
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:34,742
Apologize at once.

675
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,788
She went to high school with me.

676
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:43,793
When she found out about my affair,
she blackmailed me into bringing you here.

677
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:51,759
Clearly,

678
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:54,846
you knew about me and Woo-jae.

679
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:57,307
Was this why you demanded
the three of us meet?

680
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:00,977
To see my reaction the moment my husband…

681
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,855
spilled the truth?

682
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:08,276
The fact that Detective Kim came to see me

683
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:11,446
means that you know
as much as he knows about me.

684
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:12,864
I just didn't like that.

685
00:58:12,947 --> 00:58:16,493
You played dumb when you knew everything.
You were putting on an act.

686
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:19,245
Jeong-won,

687
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:23,124
you were convinced that Woo-jae and I
murdered Cha together.

688
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,669
Now you know that we both have alibis.

689
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:30,256
So you won't suspect us anymore, right?

690
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:34,677
You see, the two of us…

691
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:38,723
we're long-time friends,
we studied abroad together.

692
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:43,311
We kept it from you
because we were very close.

693
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:45,730
In case you'd misunderstand.

694
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:50,568
So you two never dated?

695
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:54,614
Why would I… With her?

696
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:56,991
No, never.

697
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:06,334
I thought you two were having an affair.

698
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:10,672
I guess you had
a one-sided crush on my husband.

699
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:20,640
Well, for a short while when I was young.

700
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:25,270
He's good-looking
and comes from a good family.

701
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:30,108
That's how he married you

702
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:32,485
and had an affair with Eun-sae too.

703
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:33,778
Yoo Yun-yeong!

704
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:36,739
I'm doing this for you.

705
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:40,201
I felt bad that your wife
suspected you of murder

706
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:41,828
and that we dated.

707
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,624
Now, you know everything.

708
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:50,003
You can put your mind at ease.

709
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:56,843
There's more.

710
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:00,305
Why do you record all your sessions?

711
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:03,433
Are you recording this now too?

712
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:07,103
I will never book a session
with you again.

713
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:09,355
I came to tell you this.

714
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:31,002
Jeong-won.

715
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:34,172
I should have never met you.

716
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:39,344
Take the next one.

717
01:01:29,602 --> 01:01:31,729
I didn't hear from you after you asked me

718
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:34,399
to look into Yoo Yun-yeong,
so I've been bored.

719
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:37,485
Unfortunately, I'm stuck
and haven't made any progress.

720
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:40,363
Mo Hyeong-taek's daughter
opened the clinic for her.

721
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:41,739
Look into that.

722
01:01:46,327 --> 01:01:47,870
ZEUS

723
01:01:49,163 --> 01:01:51,040
Sorry, I pressed the wrong button.

724
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:55,920
I thought you dropped your phone again,
like the time you found the housekeeper.

725
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:01,551
Keep walking towards your two o'clock.

726
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:09,100
I'm getting a call.

727
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:11,102
I have to go.

728
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:16,232
I never told him about

729
01:02:17,608 --> 01:02:18,901
dropping my phone.

730
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:21,571
Was he…

731
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:24,699
watching me that night?

732
01:02:30,204 --> 01:02:31,748
74MO 4272

733
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:33,583
Did he…

734
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:36,294
follow me here?

735
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:23,090
Did you see my wife today?

736
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:25,343
Her phone is off and she didn't come home.

737
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:27,762
Sir, I know who the killer is.

738
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:30,723
You killed them all!
Jin Myeong-suk and my sister too.

739
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:32,266
You are Zeus, aren't you?

740
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:35,561
-What if something happened?
-Hey, don't tell me…

741
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:37,814
Did you contact Jeong-won again?

742
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:39,357
Why? Do you feel anxious?

743
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:43,110
I want you to be lonelier
and more miserable.

744
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:45,530
I think Jeong-won is in danger.
I need your help.

745
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:48,574
If anything bad happens to Jeong-won,
I really will…
