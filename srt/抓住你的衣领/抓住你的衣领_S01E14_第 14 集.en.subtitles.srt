1
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,297
ALL LOCATIONS, NAMES, EVENTS
ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,382
CHILD SAFETY GUIDELINES
FOLLOWED DURING FILMING.

3
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:33,927
Why did you kill Cha Eun-sae, Father?

4
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:38,723
Jeong-won found the spy cam footage
Yun-yeong left behind.

5
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:40,809
She showed it to me.

6
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,313
Why did you get Mr. Gong
to kill Cha Eun-sae?

7
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,484
Was it for my sake, again?

8
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:57,784
ONE DAY BEFORE CHA EUN-SAE DIED

9
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,430
You must be very surprised,

10
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:24,102
but that baby is your grandchild,
so I hope this news makes you happy.

11
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,939
I'm confident
I can take good care of Woo-jae

12
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,774
while raising my child well.

13
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:35,029
I'll retire and stay overseas
until Woo-jae's divorce is sorted out.

14
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,747
I'm not being clingy because of the baby.

15
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,835
I truly love Woo-jae.

16
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:52,463
So much that
I can embrace his dirty laundry.

17
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:54,924
His dirty laundry?

18
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,634
Did you know about it?

19
00:02:57,385 --> 00:03:00,597
Woo-jae killed a girl named Lee Na-ri.

20
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,235
I don't care what he did in the past.

21
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,529
I want to embrace his deep scars too.

22
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:18,948
All of it.

23
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:23,036
Please accept me, sir.

24
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:43,431
Thank goodness she told me
before telling you.

25
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:46,059
Even so, she was pregnant.

26
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,685
You knew it wasn't your child.

27
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,354
Still, how could you kill her?

28
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,523
Mr. Gong killed Lee Ba-reun too, right?

29
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,275
He found Na-ri,

30
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:56,903
so Mr. Gong got rid of him.

31
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:00,448
How could he do that more than once?

32
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:03,785
You said you got how parents
could do anything for their children.

33
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,622
You recently went to Mueonsan, didn't you?

34
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:11,084
I'll take care of the footage
from the area on that day.

35
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,586
Father, did you know that…

36
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,381
Mr. Gong killed Jeong-won's father too?

37
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:19,884
And that incident…

38
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,265
You didn't order him to do that, did you?

39
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,855
Come straight to my place
when you're back in Seoul.

40
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,839
Go back to Mueon

41
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:00,383
and delete all the security footage
from Mueonsan.

42
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,594
-I wasn't caught on camera. Don't worry--
-Not you.

43
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,681
I'm worried Woo-jae was caught on camera
on January 10.

44
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,059
Understood, sir.

45
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,938
Tomorrow, Chairman Jang will visit
Mujin Resort to attend the conference

46
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,358
Make sure Woo-jae and his wife
greet him in person.

47
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,901
Yes, sir.

48
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,612
The video from the camera Yoo hid,

49
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,239
Jeong-won found it.

50
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,952
The problem is she's convinced

51
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,624
the man in the video
is the same man who killed her father.

52
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,420
Look at me.

53
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,424
Didn't you say Jeong-won fainted then?

54
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,176
Did you lie?

55
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,344
No, sir.

56
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,806
If you covered your face,
how did she know it was the same man?

57
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,770
Woo-jae saw the video too.

58
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:57,231
He asked if I ordered
Jeong-won's father to be killed.

59
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,942
I'll say it was all me,
and you weren't involved--

60
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,486
He won't go for it.

61
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:05,782
Once he knows the truth,
he'll want to tell his wife.

62
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,039
Why now?

63
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,252
You've never once let me down.

64
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,214
Have your skills gotten rusty?

65
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,133
I apologize.

66
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,885
I'm not demanding an apology.

67
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,347
Bring me a solution.

68
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:57,500
Mr. Seol, Yeongho Group's Chairman Jang
is at Mujin Resort for a conference.

69
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,294
Your father wishes you
to greet him in person.

70
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,548
He wants you
to be present as well, Ms. Seo.

71
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,218
-Come with me.
-Jeong-won hurt her ankle.

72
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:09,720
She'll do it another time.

73
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,557
How about you come alone
to greet the chairman, then?

74
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,683
Why do you…

75
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,060
make me repeat myself?

76
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,024
I apologize.

77
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,363
Let's go.

78
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,687
You saw me get humiliated.

79
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:01,522
That was embarrassing.

80
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,452
Tae-heon,

81
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,622
I heard that you're here
about Lee Ba-reun's murder.

82
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,501
Will you return to Seoul today?

83
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,713
-Yes.
-Shall we meet for lunch?

84
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:33,804
Sorry.

85
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,683
First a murder,
and now they've found a skeleton.

86
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:40,728
It's quite a headache.

87
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,022
I knew the victim too.

88
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,943
In times like this,
you should try even harder to keep cool.

89
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,030
I will.

90
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,287
Hello, sir.

91
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:00,915
Sure.

92
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,878
I have something to take care of.

93
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,421
I can't join you for lunch.

94
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,092
Mr. Gong…

95
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,304
Can we have dinner instead?

96
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:19,141
Okay. See you back in Seoul.

97
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,584
Will you…

98
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,628
find the killer yourself?

99
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,422
My dad and then Ba-reun.

100
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:54,427
He took away two people
that meant a lot to me.

101
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,973
Who is this person?

102
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:01,434
Why are they connected to me so viciously?

103
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,644
I'll find out, no matter what.

104
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,114
Was it fate?

105
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,451
I witnessed Cha Eun-sae's death

106
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:19,827
and came this far.

107
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:23,956
It feels like

108
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,668
a massive mountain

109
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,296
that I can't avoid but have to climb.

110
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:33,674
I must do

111
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,135
whatever it takes to get over it.

112
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,180
Is that mountain…

113
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:42,516
me?

114
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:51,442
I'm the reason
you got involved in Eun-sae's death.

115
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:06,791
You rebelled just like this

116
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,834
when you got caught
with cigarettes at school.

117
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,252
Come here, you punk.

118
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,379
Let go of me.

119
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,424
My gosh. You haven't aged at all.

120
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,550
Who are you, mister?

121
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,844
-Are you a thug?
-I'm a cop, you brat.

122
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,513
You little…

123
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,223
Tae-heon,

124
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:23,724
give up.

125
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,185
For Reporter Seo's sake

126
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,104
and for your own sake too.

127
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,319
There's no way he did it.

128
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,989
He was a cop,
and he's a better man than anyone.

129
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:41,659
It's not him.

130
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,412
It can't be him.

131
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:50,501
Hi.

132
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:53,587
Gong Jun-ho's phone.
was at Seol Pan-ho's all day.

133
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:57,091
Seol Woo-jae's father's place?
Was it anywhere else?

134
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,260
No. I think he was there all along.

135
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,556
Okay.

136
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,942
You must leave now
if you want to be on time.

137
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:18,195
Missing one campaign event
won't affect my support ratings.

138
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,865
You should attend all planned events.

139
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,033
Darn it.

140
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,668
I thought, this time,
I'd finally gotten the upper hand.

141
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:38,090
Forget about 49% of the profits
from Mujin's second resort.

142
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,342
I ended up upsetting him,

143
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,888
and it looks like I might lose
much more than I gain.

144
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:48,642
How much is 49% of the profits
expected to be?

145
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:52,146
We think it'll be about $44.3 million.

146
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,522
Gosh.

147
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,025
That much would cover

148
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,779
whatever I need for this election
and my presidential campaign

149
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:05,576
and free me from Seol Pan-ho's grasp.

150
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,286
What will you do, sir?

151
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,165
I'll give him this for now,

152
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,793
and pretend to bow to him.

153
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:18,130
When a fight is dragged out,
the rich man wins.

154
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,715
If you bow to him now,

155
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:23,844
Chairman Seol will believe
he has full control over you.

156
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,013
He'll make even more exorbitant demands.

157
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,389
Before he does,

158
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:31,268
I must find something else
to strangle him with.

159
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,521
Do you have something?

160
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:39,276
That detective guy, Kim Tae-heon,

161
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,946
yesterday, out of the blue,

162
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,366
he tracked Secretary Gong's phone.

163
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,535
Chairman Seol's secretary?

164
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:50,871
You know my hunch on these matters
is never wrong.

165
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:14,895
In many ways,

166
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,898
it will be hard to bear,

167
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,610
and it will hurt,
but let's try to get through it.

168
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,196
Bye.

169
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,222
Come over now.

170
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,905
How could the pattern on the knife
be the same?

171
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:10,159
SEO SANG-GYEON'S DEATH

172
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,293
KBM REPORTER SEO SANG-GYEON
FOUND DEAD AT HOME

173
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:20,502
January 10?

174
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,215
January 10.

175
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,429
JANUARY 10, 2010

176
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,850
It totally pays to get accepted
to the Police University.

177
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,769
Who knew I'd be having
a fancy meal like this?

178
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:41,190
You barely got in, from the waitlist.
Don't show off. Eat up.

179
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,192
Seriously?

180
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,697
You're dressed in black from head to toe.

181
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,407
And the baseball cap.

182
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,700
Did you come from a stakeout?

183
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,161
Or do you have to go on one later?

184
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,873
I must leave in ten minutes. Eat quickly.

185
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,542
Where are you going? Can I tag along?

186
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,711
It'll be a detective experience.

187
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,213
You're getting cheeky again.

188
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,927
Are you beating up a junior
who hasn't even started school?

189
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,845
What kind of detective are you?

190
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,935
You're the reason
I applied to the Police University.

191
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,561
What kind of cop do you think I'll be?

192
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,480
Just don't turn into one like me.

193
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,699
Having a knife with the same pattern

194
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,953
and wearing same outfit as the culprit
on the day her dad died?

195
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,123
It can't be a coincidence.

196
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,672
The chairman wanted to see me.

197
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,465
Let's take a rain check on dinner.

198
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,494
Well, now that…

199
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,040
I've decided to be a despicable man,

200
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,000
no matter whose murder you're behind,

201
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,377
I can look the other way.

202
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,713
However,

203
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,424
I can't do the same
with Jeong-won's father's murder.

204
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,053
Father…

205
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:38,974
Father,

206
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:43,187
please tell me you had nothing to do
with his murder.

207
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:46,565
You had no reason to kill him.

208
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,319
Put yourself in Jeong-won's shoes.

209
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,822
Having your father
killed by your father-in-law…

210
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,950
That shouldn't happen to anyone.

211
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,078
Reporter Seo Sang-gyeon

212
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,914
was investigating me persistently
back then.

213
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:07,669
He must've gotten wind of corruption
when I was establishing the first resort.

214
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:12,049
I assume that he followed the car
you were driving that night,

215
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,802
thinking I was the one driving.

216
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:44,748
I doubt that he just happened to witness
your hit-and-run accident.

217
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,669
So Jeong-won's father…

218
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,087
He blackmailed me,

219
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,965
saying he had filmed a video
of the accident with his camera.

220
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,134
So did you get Secretary Gong

221
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,473
to kill her father?

222
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:19,283
You should've just sent me to prison
when you had the chance.

223
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,617
How could you have

224
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,620
Jeong-won as your daughter-in-law?

225
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,164
I disapproved of your decision.

226
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:28,417
You should've told me the real reason
for your disapproval.

227
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,752
It wasn't because she was an orphan!

228
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,380
You disapproved
because you killed her father!

229
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,468
Had I known the truth,
I would've never married her.

230
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,762
I would have given up.

231
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,475
Why aren't you saying anything?

232
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,896
Come on. Say something!

233
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,732
I made all these decisions for your sake.

234
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,365
The result of the decisions
you made for my sake

235
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,410
is that Jeong-won

236
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:08,832
became family with the murderer
who killed her father.

237
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,334
-Seol Woo-jae--
-Father…

238
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,212
Father,

239
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:17,758
do you think I'll be able to carry on
as if nothing has happened?

240
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,301
Do you think that's possible?

241
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:23,055
If it's not possible,
will you tell your wife the truth?

242
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:27,017
You'll have to reveal your crime too,
not just mine.

243
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:31,647
Your child will have to live forever
as a murderer's child.

244
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:36,318
Get a grip, for your child's sake.

245
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,446
I should never have met you.

246
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,991
I should have never loved you.

247
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,048
I'll drink it for you.
I'll get totally wasted.

248
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,267
Gosh, Tae-heon.

249
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,561
You have your hunch.

250
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:37,689
There must be something suspicious
about him. Am I right?

251
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,984
Gosh. This is bad.

252
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:45,572
If Gong Jun-ho is indeed the culprit,
what will you do?

253
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,993
What would you do if I were a murderer?

254
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,334
Gosh.

255
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,169
I would arrest you.

256
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,175
Of course, you should.

257
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,136
I really hope he's not the culprit.

258
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:13,100
If you find any clue that he is,
will you share that with Ms. Seo?

259
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:16,103
Then she'll be even more reckless than me.

260
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,396
So I can't. It's too risky.

261
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:38,125
Getting betrayed by my friend
wasn't bad enough.

262
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:45,215
I'm about to get betrayed by a man
who was a father figure to me too.

263
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:50,178
He was even a former police officer.

264
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:58,353
I couldn't forgive you for taking bribes.

265
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,356
But killing an innocent man…

266
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,024
What should I do?

267
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:48,195
How do I go on with my life after this?

268
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,880
I thought I'd at least
get to say goodbye to him.

269
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,090
That brat.

270
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:12,928
What do we do? I feel so bad for him.

271
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,473
Hey, stop.

272
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:19,517
I'm sad too,
but Jeong-won has no energy left to cry.

273
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:25,649
Let's do a report on this
and catch the scumbag who killed Ba-reun.

274
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:28,235
We can live stream it, you know?

275
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:31,696
Let's find that scumbag
and avenge Ba-reun's death.

276
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,781
What do you say?

277
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:33,698
Does that mean

278
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,868
you'll follow her and resign too?

279
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:39,371
No, that's not what I meant.

280
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:42,374
I just got a little worked up.
It was a slip of the tongue.

281
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:48,171
I put Mr. No in charge
of covering Ba-reun's case.

282
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:51,007
I told him to keep digging,
no matter how long it takes.

283
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,510
Even if everyone else forgets,

284
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,178
I'll never forget.

285
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,471
I won't forget either.

286
00:25:57,347 --> 00:26:00,433
Your team will keep on digging through KBM
while I dig from outside.

287
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,144
Let's track down the killer.

288
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:12,862
VOTE FOR GANGWON'S HOPEFUL FUTURE!

289
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:16,074
FAIR ELECTION FOR BRIGHTER FUTURE OF KOREA

290
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,450
Assemblyman, please look here.

291
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:18,827
Look at the camera.

292
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,787
Thank you.

293
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,623
We must never forget.

294
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,208
Moving on to the next report.

295
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,961
Early voting for the local elections

296
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:30,964
takes place for two days, starting today.

297
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:33,008
We prepared a report on how to vote,

298
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:35,260
things to keep in mind,
and the voting hours

299
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:38,888
so you can exercise your right to vote.
Reporter Kim has more on this.

300
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,098
Tae-heon.

301
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,226
They've just released
Lee Na-ri's autopsy report.

302
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,604
About the fracture
on the right side of the skull,

303
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:47,981
Mo Soo-rin was right.

304
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:49,899
It seems Yoo hit her
with a fire extinguisher.

305
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:54,195
"Crush fractures in the fibula, scapula,
and lumbar spine?" That means…

306
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,365
It means the toxic gas
certainly wasn't the cause of death.

307
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,950
If she had crush fractures,

308
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:02,537
it means she was hit with a blunt weapon,
fell or died in a car accident.

309
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,789
Lee Na-ri? No.

310
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:09,210
Mr. Hong, our driver at the time,
was driving,

311
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,296
and I was sitting in the passenger seat.

312
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,758
We hit Min-cheol, so I called it in.

313
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:16,885
It was a car accident.

314
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,346
That's what Seol Woo-jae said himself.

315
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,722
So it was a hit-and-run?

316
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:24,100
She was either in the car that he hit,

317
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,810
or he ran over her with the car.

318
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:30,357
Whether he hit her with the car or not,
that guy really scares me.

319
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,025
I mean, she was his girlfriend.

320
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:34,319
If it wasn't him,
that means it was Mr. Gong.

321
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,280
If Seol Woo-jae was the driver,

322
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:40,992
and if that man buried her
as per Chairman Seol's order…

323
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,244
Gong Jun-ho is Chairman Seol's secretary,

324
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,080
meaning it's his job
to clean up the messes.

325
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:49,751
We need proof that he was working
for Chairman Seol at the time too.

326
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:52,837
That way, we can say
he had motive for killing Lee and Cha.

327
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,840
Do you think Chairman Seol
compensated him for the job?

328
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:57,801
With money?

329
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,304
Well, they say money conquers all,

330
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:04,557
but do you think he was that desperate
that he had to kill someone?

331
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:09,687
Your life isn't that easy either.

332
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,775
As a widowed man
with a sibling with a rare disease.

333
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:23,660
He said his sister had a rare disease.

334
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:26,704
He said her medications alone
cost millions of won a year.

335
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,999
That's the reason he left the police force

336
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,251
and joined Mujin Group.

337
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,002
When did he join Mujin Group?

338
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:35,797
I found that out later,
so I don't know the exact date.

339
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,883
We must prove that the link between them
dates back to 2009.

340
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,468
Wouldn't his sister know?

341
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,845
Do you know where she is?

342
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:44,597
All I know is
she's in a nursing home in Gyeonggi-do.

343
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,559
Let's do some legwork. It's been a while.

344
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,064
KBM NEWSROOM REPORTER FOUND MURDERED

345
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,156
MAN IN HIS 20S FOUND DEAD,
POLICE INVESTIGATING

346
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,578
I will survive and avenge your death.

347
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:08,997
I'll do whatever it takes
to catch the killer.

348
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,458
I give you my word.

349
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,885
Hello.

350
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:25,013
You don't look like Mr. Gong.

351
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,849
-Who are you?
-I'm Detective Kim Tae-heon.

352
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:30,935
Kim Tae-heon?

353
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,062
The name rings a bell.

354
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:35,607
Mr. Gong said
he'd told his sister about me.

355
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:39,360
I'm young enough to be his son,
but we're close friends.

356
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:44,365
You must be the guy who became a cop
inspired by my brother.

357
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:47,160
Anyway, what brings you here?

358
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:49,788
Did you come here to meet me?

359
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:56,586
I'm visiting the nursing home in the area
to find a witness.

360
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,881
Then I remembered
he said that his sister was here.

361
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,424
So I decided to drop by.

362
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,969
Thank you for visiting me.

363
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,221
This made my day.

364
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:09,766
How are you feeling?

365
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,644
The pain comes back
when the drugs wear off,

366
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:15,396
but it goes away again
when the injections kick in.

367
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,440
He once told me your diagnosis.

368
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,443
But I forgot. The name was too difficult.

369
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,655
Even I need a moment to remember the name.

370
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:27,659
But I'm glad the disease is treatable.

371
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,829
That's a curse for my brother.

372
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:35,208
His entire life,
he had to spend more than he earned.

373
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:39,045
When exactly were you diagnosed
with the disease?

374
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,256
I believe it was over ten years ago.

375
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,757
In 2009.

376
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:48,429
You must've been devastated then.
Your medications must be expensive too.

377
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:51,474
That was when things
started going downhill.

378
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:55,770
My brother got into debt,
even borrowing money from loan sharks.

379
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,522
Back then, he was a cop.

380
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,441
How did he handle all the expenses?

381
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,068
He couldn't,

382
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,281
so I was going to just kill myself.

383
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:10,493
But he found me in a few hours and told me

384
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:13,037
that he'd found a sponsor,
so I shouldn't worry.

385
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,290
A sponsor?

386
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,585
Did he tell you who it was?

387
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,587
The chairman of some company.

388
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,047
Do you happen to know
which company it was?

389
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,927
I think he said
it was a construction company.

390
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:31,097
Thanks to that person, I'm still alive.

391
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:45,111
His sister was diagnosed with the disease
before the Bongto plant fire.

392
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:47,739
She said a construction company chairman
helped them.

393
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:49,490
I bet it was Mujin's Seol Pan-ho.

394
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,410
And they've been working together since.

395
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,330
-Hey, did you look into that thing I said?
-Right.

396
00:31:55,413 --> 00:32:00,460
Gong Jun-ho got employment insurance
through Mujin Construction in 2012.

397
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:02,670
Looks like that's when he joined Mujin.

398
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,924
Then from the time he found out
about her disease in 2009

399
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,425
to the time he joined Mujin,

400
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:09,761
he paid her medical bills
with the help of the sponsor.

401
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:12,972
We can reasonably conclude
he was paid to kill those people.

402
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,057
Right?

403
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:17,727
Are you all right?

404
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,145
No.

405
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:20,939
Oh, boy.

406
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,069
Reporter Seo is here.

407
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,489
I'm here, so don't tell her anything
about the case.

408
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,077
Reporter Seo, what brings you by?

409
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,204
I kept calling you but you didn't pick up.

410
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,498
Did you photograph all the pages
in Ba-reun's notepad?

411
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:39,415
Yes.

412
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:42,043
I want to go through them
to see if I can find anything useful.

413
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,169
Can I take a look?

414
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,422
All right, sure.

415
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:47,590
Thanks.

416
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,759
AUTOPSY REPORT

417
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:52,345
Is this Ba-reun's? Or is it Lee Na-ri's?

418
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:55,807
Can I see?

419
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,434
Well, it's…

420
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,530
I'm thoroughly investigating
the Lee Ba-reun case,

421
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,240
so don't push yourself too hard.

422
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,617
I can take care of myself.

423
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:25,044
Do you have something to tell me?

424
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,425
What is it?

425
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:32,635
What is it about?

426
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:35,763
No, it's nothing.

427
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,606
I'm off.

428
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,318
Seo Jeong-won.

429
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,198
You…

430
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:57,243
Can't you leave that family?

431
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,997
Can't you get a divorce right away?

432
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:06,878
Leave Seol Woo-jae.

433
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,588
You have to.

434
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:10,757
What's with you, all of a sudden?

435
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,175
You know it's not sudden!

436
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:14,719
The fact that you're with that punk

437
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:17,346
and that you're a member
of the Mujin Group family…

438
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,981
Sorry. I shouldn't be doing this.

439
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,154
I will get you

440
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,824
out of that mess as soon as I can.

441
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:00,223
What now?

442
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,558
Is it Ms. Seo?

443
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,731
This is nothing
compared to how she will feel.

444
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:10,733
She will feel

445
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:13,820
a hundred times,

446
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,739
a thousand times worse.

447
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,161
These are Lee Ba-reun's notes.

BONGTO PLANT HOLDOUT
SEO SANG-GYEON'S IN-DEPTH REPORT

452
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,715
Did my dad look into Bongto plant?

453
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,095
CHIEF KANG IN-HAN

454
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:43,057
When do you get off work?

455
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:53,025
I came here often with your dad.

456
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,988
You're his daughter after all.
You like the same foods.

457
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,410
Chief,

458
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,746
my dad visited Mueon every weekend in 2009

459
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:09,292
saying he was working on a report.

460
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:11,586
Do you know what he was working on?

461
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,840
Why would you suddenly ask about that?

462
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:23,181
This is from Ba-reun's notepad.

463
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:26,726
Was my dad looking into something
connected to Bongto plant?

464
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,146
Why was Ba-reun looking into your dad?

465
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,358
He believed that the person
who killed his sister

466
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,444
also killed my dad.

467
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:39,322
Do you have proof to back that up?

468
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:41,616
Yes.

469
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:50,124
He wasn't exactly
looking into Bongto plant.

470
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:54,003
He was looking into the construction
of Mujin's resort.

471
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:55,087
My dad looked into

472
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,340
my father-in-law's business?

473
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,467
Did he think it was corrupt?

474
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,551
Yes.

475
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:04,639
The land Bongto plant was on
was a core part of the project,

476
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:07,808
but they held out, refusing to sell,
which caused quite a fuss.

477
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,145
You mean

478
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:14,232
the plant that was a huge problem

479
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:16,317
happened to burn down.

480
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,570
It solved the problem completely.

481
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:22,740
That resort helped Mujin Construction
grow exponentially.

482
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,744
What I can say for sure is,

483
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:30,289
at the time, to your father-in-law
and Mo Hyeong-taek,

484
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,750
your dad would've been
a thorn in the flesh.

485
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,210
Why Mo Hyeong-taek?

486
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:36,963
He invested a great deal in the resort.

487
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:39,382
It was a joint venture between the two.

488
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:43,219
I guarantee you,
they've been allies for a long time.

489
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,389
They should know
each other's weaknesses best.

490
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:49,183
Breaking the laws
and exploiting loopholes.

491
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,851
It's obvious what they did.

492
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,941
-It can't be, can it?
-What do you mean?

493
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,111
Did one of them

494
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,114
get rid of my dad?

495
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:05,992
Why jump to that conclusion?

496
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,953
Come on. They wouldn't have gone that far.

497
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:11,956
One of them

498
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,458
is your father-in-law.

499
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:19,422
My dad would have known the truth.

500
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,466
I must find out somehow.

501
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:24,593
Did you not find anything

502
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:26,971
among his belongings?

503
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:31,976
I have to go.

504
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,059

507
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:24,820
He wrote this the day after the fire.

508
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,283
He wasn't exactly
looking into Bongto plant.

509
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:32,870
He was looking into the construction
of Mujin's resort.

510
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,081
What I can say for sure is,

511
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:38,125
at the time, to your father-in-law
and Mo Hyeong-taek,

512
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,044
your dad would've been
a thorn in the flesh.

513
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:50,262
He invested a great deal in the resort.

514
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,515
It was a joint venture between the two.

515
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:55,559
What if the Mueon Cartel

516
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,396
was my father-in-law and Mo Hyeong-taek?

517
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,482
Did one of them kill my dad,

518
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:03,401
Lee Na-ri

519
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,361
and Ba-reun too?

520
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,287
FATHER

521
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,461
-Hello, Father.
-Come to my place now.

522

3 YEARS AGO

523
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,697
You'll find something useful
to your research

524
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:51,365
in there.

525
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:55,953
You're looking into
how Director Shin got his son a job.

526
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:58,622
Do you really not mind
if I go on my show to expose

527
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,542
one of Mujin's directors
for doing something illegal?

528
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:02,835
Of course I do.

529
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:07,047
I told you that you changed me.

530
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,592
You must've gotten this from your father.

531
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:11,719
Forget the damage it'll do to Mujin,

532
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:14,054
what if it damages
your relationship with him?

533
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:17,725
It won't.

534
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,686
My father never stores anything digitally.

535
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:25,691
He only keeps the originals copies.
I went and scanned everything.

536
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:34,658
Somewhere in this house must be
the secret documents on the resort.

537
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:40,247
There might even be a clue
about my dad's death.

538
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:42,791
Ms. Seo.

539
00:41:56,889 --> 00:42:00,142
I heard Woo-jae sternly warned
the PR team.

540
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:03,103
I hope you don't think
that will stop all future articles.

541
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:08,192
I can put pressure on you
without using the media.

542
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:09,818
For example,

543
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:13,197
I could get the writer
that you're staying with to be fired.

544
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,325
I could also bring up your scandal
with the detective again.

545
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:20,996
Do you think I only have photos
from the hospital roof?

546
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:25,626
Jeong-won, I don't want to go that far.

547
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:28,546
Woo-jae said to me

548
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:31,340
he'd rather avoid doing
one thing that you hate

549
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:33,551
than doing ten things that you like.

550
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:39,139
How obsessed must someone become
to say something like that?

551
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:44,103
I can't allow order within my family
to crumble any further.

552
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:47,189
Move back in with Woo-jae
while I ask you nicely.

553
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:59,243
Whatever you have to tell her
can go through me.

554
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,705
Why call her over and stress her out?

555
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:04,123
Did I stress you out?

556
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:05,833
No.

557
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:08,669
He didn't.

558
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:18,596
I realized that I was quite inconsiderate.

559
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,599
I only cared about my feelings.

560
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:24,268
I didn't think about
how people would perceive this.

561
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:28,439
If you believe
I made our family look improper,

562
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:29,815
I will move back in here.

563
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:41,035
I don't want to go back to my old house
due to my memory of getting abducted.

564
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:43,996
I'll come back tomorrow with my things.

565
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:47,708
You want to live here from now on?

566
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,383
I'll move back in too.

567
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:03,557
There will be a sense of warmth
in my house for once.

568
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:14,318
You said you would move in here.

569
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:19,573
-Did you mean that?
-Yes.

570
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,533
When did you decide that?

571
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:23,410
A while ago.

572
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:26,455
If I'm never going to win this fight,

573
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:29,792
I thought staying here
would be better than our house.

574
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:33,003
You don't have to move back in.

575
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,463
I have to move anyway.

576
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:37,633
I put the house on the market.

577
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,304
Wherever I look,
the house is just a reminder of you.

578
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:48,185
It makes me miss you like crazy.

579
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:21,427
Gosh. His life seems so boring.

580
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,930
Chairman Seol's house,
the office and home.

581
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:29,977
He shouldn't know you're on to him, right?

582
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,896
I must catch him
before he figures out I am.

583
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,067
The knife is the only lead we can use.

584
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,861
The one with the swirling pattern?

585
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:42,239
Even if you find that, it wouldn't prove
Ms. Seo's father's murder.

586
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:43,824
We won't even find Cha's blood on it.

587
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,367
I bet he already cleaned it.

588
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:48,036
If we run a simulation test
with that as the murder weapon,

589
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,788
the result will say it's a match.

590
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:52,332
You're right.

591
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:55,294
We'll be able to at least
get a warrant for Cha's case.

592
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:57,671
We must find the knife
as soon as possible.

593
00:45:57,754 --> 00:45:59,131
I must bring him down

594
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:01,675
to investigate Seol Woo-jae's case.

595
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:05,721
RYU JI-HYE
HANSU NEWSPAPER

596
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:09,349
Ms. Ryu often shared intel with your dad
because she was also investigating

597
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:12,186
the corruption behind
Mujin Resort's development.

598
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:15,022
I had to ask around a lot
to find her for you.

599
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:16,732
So, you also investigated

600
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:19,610
Chairman Seol Pan-ho
and Prosecutor Mo Hyeong-taek.

601
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:22,779
I did, but I don't feel comfortable
talking about it

602
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:24,490
because he's your father-in-law.

603
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,074
No need to.

604
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:28,368
I'm investigating him too.

605
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:38,629
This is the memo my dad wrote
after the fire at Bongto plant.

606
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:40,464
"Mueon Cartel."

607
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:42,341
"Corruption behind
the development and more."

608
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:44,051
"Which truth should come first?"

609
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,053
What? What's this about?

610
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:49,598
My father found out
about Lee Na-ri's death.

611
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:52,684
When he blackmailed someone
about her death, he was murdered.

612
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:56,980
It says, "And more."
He was alluding to Lee Na-ri's death.

613
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,233
Oh, my.

614
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:03,111
Your father did harass the two
pretty harshly.

615
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:06,740
I didn't know
this was the story behind that.

616
00:47:06,823 --> 00:47:09,660
Did my father tell you
about the possibility

617
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:11,828
of another crime they committed,

618
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:13,288
or say anything relevant?

619
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:17,125
Didn't you two work together
to investigate a relevant case?

620
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:20,587
On the day of the fire at Bongto plant,

621
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:23,382
there was a truck crash
on the path into the plant.

622
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:28,512
DECEMBER 24, 2009

623
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:35,727
Gosh. What is this?

624
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:36,937
What's going on?

625
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:41,358
-Hurry.
-Get him out.

626
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:42,609
Sir, are you okay?

627
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,945
It was suspicious
that the path was blocked

628
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:47,864
right before the arrival
of the fire trucks.

629
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,783
Your father and I were so shocked.

630
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:53,662
The plant burned down
because they arrived late.

631
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:58,292
It looked like a coincidence,
but it definitely worked in their favor.

632
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,543
Right.

633
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:02,421
Thanks to the fire,
they could wipe out the plant site.

634
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:04,590
"Did they block the path on purpose?"

635
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,717
"They're more than capable of doing so."

636
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:08,927
That's what we talked about.

637
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:11,805
Did you have any evidence
to back up your suspicion?

638
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:15,392
At the time, we were tracking
a phone number along with the case.

639
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:19,313
The truck driver who caused the accident
was talking to this person for days.

640
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:21,565
And it turned out to be a burner phone.

641
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:23,734
You think someone paid him to do so?

642
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:25,360
That was my suspicion.

643
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:29,406
But the case was closed as an accident
where the driver dozed off.

644
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:31,199
There was nothing more I could do.

645
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,412
Could you share the number
of the burner phone you were tracking?

646
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:37,706
Actually, I found it
and brought it with me.

647
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:40,792
But apparently,
the number doesn't exist anymore.

648
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:47,883
One more thing.

649
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:50,761
Do you know
where the truck driver is imprisoned?

650
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:51,928
I'd like to meet him.

651
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:55,349
I know someone who can help.
I'll look into it.

652
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:29,716
Why is she bringing a suitcase
into that house?

653
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:36,390
I will get you

654
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:38,850
out of that mess as soon as I can.

655
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:57,285
-Is Father not home yet?
-No.

656
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:01,081
I got the guest room ready for your use.

657
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:02,207
This way.

658
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,806
The chairman was happy all day

659
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:20,434
because you and your husband
were moving into the house.

660
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:24,813
Don't you usually get off work
around this time?

661
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:27,733
Now that I've seen you settled in,
I'll get going.

662
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:41,747
TRUCK COLLIDES NEAR SITE
OF MUEON PLANT FIRE

663
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:45,792
TRUCK CRASH BLOCKS ROAD
DELAYING RESPONSE TO PLANT FIRE

664
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:48,879
If this accident was really planned,

665
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:52,132
Father or Mo Hyeong-taek
must be behind it.

666
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:54,926
Or they could be accomplices.

667
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:58,638
REPORTER RYU JI-HYE

668
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:00,557
Hello, Ms. Ryu.

669
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:03,685
I asked around
where the truck driver was now.

670
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:06,313
He committed suicide in prison
ten years ago.

671
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,023
What?

672
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:39,596
I was just about to go to your room.

673
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:42,641
The chairman personally
ordered this for you.

674
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:45,185
I'm feeling a bit sick.
I'll drink it later.

675
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:48,021
-I need a vase.
-Hold on.

676
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:50,649
Let me do it for you.

677
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:01,451
Now that I'm going to live here,
I realize how big this house is.

678
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:04,120
The house will feel less empty
now that you and your husband

679
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:06,122
will be living here.

680
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:07,207
I see.

681
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:11,127
Anything I should be careful about?

682
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:14,714
Like rooms I'm not supposed to enter,
for example.

683
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:18,969
No one's allowed to enter the last room
on the same floor as the chairman's study.

684
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:22,973
Where should I put these flowers?

685
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,768
That's my present for Father.
I'll put them in his study.

686
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:27,853
Okay.

687
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:23,825
You're home, Father.

688
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:28,663
I bought you some flowers.

689
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:31,583
I put them here.
I was just about to leave.

690
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:35,378
Please excuse me.

691
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:41,384
"One rebuke cuts into a man of discernment

692
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:45,805
deeper than a hundred lashes
cut into a fool."

693
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:50,268
I know why you're here, so quit acting.

694
00:53:59,694 --> 00:54:03,657
The development of the first Mujin Resort
went well without any issues.

695
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:07,619
We're about to embark on
the development of the second resort.

696
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:09,329
No more funny business.

697
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:20,632
Thanks for the flowers,
my daughter-in-law.

698
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:46,574
I found out
about the truck driver's mother.

699
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:48,910
I called the phone number to check.

700
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:51,496
I said I was a reporter,
and she was eager to meet,

701
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:53,415
as if she wanted to prove something.

702
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,334
Hello?

703
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:58,086
Hello? Are you there?

704
00:54:58,670 --> 00:54:59,713
Yes.

705
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:04,342
Send me her information. I'll meet her.

706
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:19,941
Hey.

707
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:21,484
We need you here now.

708
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:23,570
-Why?
-Someone showed up.

709
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,864
He says he killed Lee Ba-reun.

710
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:27,824
Both the time and location check out.

711
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:30,493
He even submitted the rope
he claims he used to kill him.

712
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:38,793
They created a fake culprit?

713
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:42,213
Hurry back here so we can find out.
You should interview him.

714
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:45,300
I should raid Gong Jun-ho now.

715
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:46,885
-What?
-We can't stall anymore.

716
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:49,345
I will find the knife
with the swirling pattern.

717
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,139
How?

718
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:53,058
Have Team Two interview him.

719
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:54,476
Just do as I say.

720
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,449
Tae-heon came to see you?

721
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:11,159
What did he ask you?

722
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:14,996
I asked your sister
when she was diagnosed.

723
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,837
She said she was diagnosed in 2009,

724
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:26,841
and a construction company chairman
took care of the expenses.

725
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:29,260
It was Mujin's Chairman
Seol Pan-ho, right?

726
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:33,890
Cha was stabbed with a knife
with a swirling pattern.

727
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:37,560
That knife is yours, right?

728
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,650
You also killed Jeong-won's father
with that knife.

729
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:47,320
If I'm wrong, you can say so.

730
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:52,033
I want to be wrong,
so go ahead and tell me so.

731
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,494
What are you talking about?

732
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:57,205
You know what I'm talking about.
You know everything!

733
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:05,088
Are you happy you saved your sister
by taking innocent lives?

734
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:08,550
-Stop.
-You need to stop!

735
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:12,679
I'll give you one last chance,
so turn yourself in.

736
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:13,763
Please, do it for me.

737
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:18,393
Please turn in the knife
and come with me to the precinct.

738
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:21,104
You'll regret this later.

739
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:27,819
I knew it'd be useless,

740
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:33,116
but I was hopeful for a moment.

741
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:37,495
Mr. Gong…

742
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:50,800
I will search your body to find the knife.

743
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:54,512
Tae-heon!

744
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:22,207
Tae-heon.

745
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:23,791
Tae-heon!

746
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:33,778
Did you know this?

747
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:36,114
I chose you
because of how desperate you were,

748
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:37,532
not your capabilities.

749
00:59:37,615 --> 00:59:39,909
No one can beat a desperate man.

750
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:43,162
He paid my overdue hospital bills at once.

751
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,290
So you think he was bribed?

752
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:48,459
"Violent Crimes Unit,
Songo Police, Gong Jun-ho."

753
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:50,044
Father, were you the one behind it?

754
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:51,337
My father too.

755
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,840
Gong Jun-ho wasn't my secretary in 2009.

756
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:56,676
Mo Hyeong-taek was the one
who introduced him to me.

757
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:58,928
Mr. Gong promised me
that he'd take the fall

758
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:00,305
for everything if he got caught.

759
01:00:00,388 --> 01:00:02,974
You ordered him
to cause the accident too, right?

760
01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:06,144
I really can't imagine
the world without you.

761
01:00:06,227 --> 01:00:09,147
I'll never leave you.

762
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:10,315
I promise.

763
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:12,066
Father, when I'm your age,

764
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:14,611
I'll be a monster too, right?
