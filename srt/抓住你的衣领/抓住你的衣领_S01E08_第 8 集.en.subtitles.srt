1
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:49,299
LOCATIONS, PEOPLE, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,263
74MO 4272

3
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:57,807
Did he…

4
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:00,518
follow me here?

5
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,998
A knife from your place was planted

6
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,709
at the house of the person
who was to be framed.

7
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:27,587
So we know who the next target will be.

8
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:32,091
But what if it gets me in trouble?

9
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:35,094
That will never happen. I'm sure of it.

10
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,223
Let me pour you one.

11
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,825
Try and imagine what could happen

12
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,911
the moment your filth splatters on me.

13
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,105
What are you doing?

14
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:30,942
You dare tail a detective?

15
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,821
Assemblyman Mo!
Your aide tailed me in Mueon.

16
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:37,365
Should I interrogate him at the precinct

17
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,075
or at your place?

18
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,830
Goodness. You're naive.

19
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:47,083
You thought you wouldn't get caught
tailing a cop?

20
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,878
I'm really sorry.

21
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:52,463
I apologize.

22
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:56,593
Mr. Song, did it make you that nervous
to hear I was going to Mueon?

23
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:59,929
I heard you were digging up
an old case Mr. Mo handled,

24
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,890
so I had to go find out.

25
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,476
We don't want controversy about
working with the media.

26
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,813
This will cause a bigger controversy.

27
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,273
Why take it in your hands?

28
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,860
You didn't order him to?

29
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,239
No, he did not.
That's an unfair speculation.

30
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,574
An unfair speculation?

31
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,701
It's reasonable from his perspective.

32
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,040
The other detective told me

33
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:30,043
that Ms. Jin's ex-husband

34
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,420
was Park Jin-su,
the manager of the Bongto Factory.

35
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:33,713
Yes.

36
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,506
So that's why she came here

37
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,968
and collected news articles about me.

38
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:40,887
I think so too.

39
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,975
You think I'm connected
not only to Ms. Jin's case,

40
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,269
but to Cha Eun-sae's case as well?

41
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,365
Were you Cha's sponsor?

42
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:03,993
You're a detective.

43
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:09,332
You shouldn't let such
trashy tabloid stories confuse you, right?

44
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,503
In the upcoming elections,

45
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,838
I'll run for Governor of Gangwon-do.

46
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,842
I have nothing to do
with either of these cases.

47
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:25,807
So I hope this doesn't get in the way
of my campaign schedule.

48
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,684
What about Cha Geum-sae?

49
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,057
This was Eun-sae's.

50
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,686
She bought it for my birthday.

51
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,110
You see…

52
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,530
Eun-sae and I got along
more often than not.

53
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,408
We were each other's only family.

54
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,246
If I'd known that it was you,

55
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,583
I wouldn't have done something
that stupid, you know?

56
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,377
I know everything.

57
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,796
Go on, confess everything.

58
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,923
-What?
-This is nuts.

59
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,150
Confess? What do you mean?

60
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,860
You killed them all!

61
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,779
Jin Myeong-suk and my sister!

62
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,250
MY HONEY

63
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,213
This phone is switched off. Please leave…

64
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,891
Hello, Ms. Yang. Is Jeong-won with you?

65
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:35,520
What? Jeong-won left earlier.
She said she was tired.

66
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:36,771
At what time?

67
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,898
Around 9:30 p.m. Why do you ask?

68
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,734
She's not home yet, and her phone is off.

69
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:45,404
Really? She should be back home soon.

70
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,949
Please let me know if you hear from her.

71
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,518
-Were you waiting for me?
-I'm waiting for my wife.

72
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,523
My wife. Did you see her today?

73
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,360
Pathological jealousy?

74
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,528
You should ask her.

75
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,823
Her phone is off, and she's not home yet.

76
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:34,245
She's been unreachable
since 9:30, when she left work.

77
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,167
So, you haven't seen her today.

78
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,961
Clearly, you seem relieved.

79
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,714
Clearly, you're still hung up on her.

80
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:56,142
Jeong-won promised me
that she'd keep her distance from you.

81
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,146
She and I will never split up.

82
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:04,442
So don't get your hopes up.

83
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,081
This phone is switched off. Please leave…

84
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,755
Even if you freak out
and scream like that,

85
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,299
no one can hear you. Why?

86
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:14,303
When you passed out,
the guard made his last round.

87
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:18,182
So let's stop wasting
each other's energy, okay?

88
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,311
Do you think no one will look for me?

89
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,231
What you're doing is a crime.

90
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,612
You don't care about your crimes, do you?

91
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,406
Darn you!

92
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:36,409
Hey.

93
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,078
I know everything.

94
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,206
The same person killed
Jin Myeong-suk and my sister.

95
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:43,791
Darn it.

96
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,254
And that killer was you.

97
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,008
So…

98
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,594
stop acting out.

99
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,513
I'll record everything, so confess.

100
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:03,019
Why are you doing this?
What convinced you that it was me?

101
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,771
You're still playing dumb.

102
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,649
Let me show you.

103
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:19,493
You know what bag this is, don't you?

104
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:27,168
THE DAY OF JIN MYEONG-SUK'S MURDER

105
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,136
Hello, Mr. Song.

106
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,474
I'm watching her.

107
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:45,436
The woman stays indoors
once she returns from work.

108
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:50,066
You can't dock my pay
even if I don't get anything.

109
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,236
Okay, then. Bye.

110
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:03,954
No one else went up there.

111
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,301
It's me.

112
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:21,597
Looks like Jin Myeong-suk has a visitor.

113
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,183
If I find out who it is,

114
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,603
I want double. Deal?

115
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,581
What is this?

116
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,295
Lady…

117
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,133
What's this?

118
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,971
Darn it, lady.

119
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,223
What's this? What's all this money?

120
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,350
Help…

121
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,353
What do you expect me to do?

122
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,147
Darn it.

123
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,606
Help me.

124
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,075
That's why, when you visited me,

125
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,119
you recognized this bag.

126
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,706
Because you were hiding right there.

127
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:32,293
Was Ms. Jin still alive then?

128
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,925
I wasn't the one who was hiding.
No, it wasn't me.

129
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,429
I went in after Ms. Jin had died.

130
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:44,805
Stop lying.

131
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,059
How did you recognize the bag, then?

132
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,271
I had run away with it by then.

133
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:54,773
By the way…

134
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,027
I had no idea you'd been at the scene.

135
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,453
So you're saying…

136
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:13,209
you realized that just now…
after I told you about it?

137
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,759
Don't play games with me.

138
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,762
Admit that you killed her…

139
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,018
before I go down for it.

140
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,867
CALL

141
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:47,910
REPORTER SEO JEONG-WON

142
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:51,413
This phone is switched off.
Please leave a message…

143
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:04,134
Seo's phone has been off since last night.

144
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,469
Find out where it was.

145
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,711
I'm where her phone turned off.

146
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:41,505
The memory card in her dashcam is gone.

147
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,465
What? What about traffic cameras?

148
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,552
There aren't any. Something's off.

149
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,304
Who would try to hurt her?

150
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,098
Someone who'd hurt her on purpose.

151
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,310
You're a reporter,
but you need to be careful.

152
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,313
What if Cha did it?

153
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,815
You could have been alone
in the house with a murderer.

154
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:01,650
I have to go.

155
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:29,136
Cha's car was at the place
where Seo's phone went off.

156
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,597
Locate the scumbag now. Hurry!

157
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,724
Jeez.

158
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,484
Darn it.

159
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,302
Since you won't confess…

160
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,640
I must avenge my sister's death myself.

161
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,018
All right. I'll do it.

162
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,232
You should've said that sooner.

163
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,401
Where is it? Hang on.

164
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,154
Go on.

165
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,450
The person who killed Jin…

166
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,375
was you, Cha Geum-sae.

167
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,420
If you'd called for help right away,

168
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,672
she might have survived.

169
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,883
Why did you steal from her?

170
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,136
Why avenge her?
You don't deserve to be a brother!

171
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,763
Do you have a death wish?

172
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,731
Darn it.

173
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,233
Shoot.

174
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,533
Open the door before I bash it in!

175
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:17,161
I'm going to kill you. Open the door.

176
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,370
Darn it.

177
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,023
The psychotic witch.

178
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,192
She wants to go all the way, doesn't she?

179
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,695
Fine, then. Let's do it.

180
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,892
I found Jeong-won's car
where you said it would be.

181
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,268
The memory card is missing.

182
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,479
Where's Detective Kim?

183
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,980
I'm looking into that.

184
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,650
GANGHA FELICE APARTMENT

185
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:30,901
That's Cha's house.

186
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:33,654
Sir, I have Detective Kim's location.

187
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,201
Just break already!

188
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,286
Come on, darn it.

189
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,750
I kept telling you to behave, didn't I?

190
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,963
Come here.

191
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,005
Come out.

192
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,300
Darn you!

193
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:58,679
Gosh.

194
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,432
Come on! Seriously!

195
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:05,310
Hey, look at us.
Seriously, what are we doing?

196
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:09,314
Look at this mess. Darn it.

197
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:15,821
You should just die.

198
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,161
Darn it.

199
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:25,622
Just die.

200
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,750
Die!

201
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:49,897
Die!

202
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,749
Hey…

203
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:12,461
You have the right to a lawyer in court.

204
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:16,757
But I clearly saw you
choking her like this.

205
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,925
You…

206
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,305
Tae-heon!

207
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,059
I'll cuff him! You go help Ms. Seo.

208
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,403
Hey, I'm the victim here.

209
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,159
Are you okay?

210
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,524
I'm sorry…

211
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,151
for taking so long.

212
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,141
Jeong-won.

213
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,189
I'm sorry.

214
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,775
I should have gotten here faster.

215
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,992
What on earth happened?

216
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,495
-I'm fine now.
-You don't look fine at all.

217
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,082
Who was it? Which lowlife did this?

218
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,918
Let's get you to the hospital.

219
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:24,343
The officer who found the victim
must accompany her to the hospital.

220
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,387
You're her guardian. You can ride with us.

221
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,978
You drove here.
I'll see you at the hospital.

222
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,713
Let me see.

223
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,718
It stopped bleeding.

224
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:12,557
What did you bump into?

225
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:15,352
Are you feeling dizzy or anything?

226
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:17,229
Any headaches?

227
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,816
Tell me if you feel nauseous or dizzy.

228
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:22,442
Okay?

229
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:42,712
JIHYANG UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

230
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:23,545
-Can you get me some water?
-Sure.

231
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,104
She's a victim who's just been admitted.

232
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,856
Is it necessary to question her now?

233
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,235
I'm not just a victim. I'm a journalist.

234
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:49,196
Go ahead.

235
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,450
The victim has agreed.
Please leave the room.

236
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,287
No. I'm her guardian. I'll stay.

237
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,546
I will feel at ease
only when I know you're okay.

238
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:08,506
Let me stay.

239
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,443
Your phone was off
around 10:00 p.m. yesterday.

240
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:31,613
Is that when you were abducted
by Cha Geum-sae?

241
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,115
Yes.

242
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,910
I passed out. When I came to…

243
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,205
I was in Cha Eun-sae's office.

244
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:45,377
Cha Geum-sae threatened me with a knife.

245
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,754
I thought I was going to die.

246
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,048
The wine opener…

247
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,678
I attacked Cha Geum-sae with it
and tried to escape.

248
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,853
I think that's enough.

249
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,986
Ms. Seo, look at me.

250
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:17,993
You're safe now.

251
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,415
We can stop if you like.

252
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:36,761
No.

253
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:38,805
Let's keep going.

254
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:44,686
Why did Cha Geum-sae kidnap you?

255
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:50,233
He had made up his mind
that I was the one who killed Jin and Cha.

256
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,736
He wanted me to confess.

257
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,408
Go.

258
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,285
One.

259
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:01,870
Nice!

260
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:18,887
Updates while shooting?
Must be something urgent.

261
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:22,432
-Work-related?
-Let's go ahead and shoot.

262
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,565
My goodness.

263
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,568
This is embarrassing.

264
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,655
SONG

265
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,867
Cha Geum-sae has been arrested

266
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,371
for abducting and assaulting
my daughter-in-law.

267
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,460
You look tense.

268
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,253
It's unnecessary.

269
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:01,262
I heard you made him keep tabs
on the housekeeper.

270
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:05,308
Maybe you should consider that
an embarrassing mistake…

271
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:08,353
before you end up losing it all.

272
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:16,778
The killer was hiding in there
when Cha left with the bag full of cash,

273
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,613
knowing Jin had been stabbed.

274
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:22,242
And he assumed you were the killer.
Is that right?

275
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,453
-Yes.
-Like he said,

276
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:29,249
isn't it possible that you hid there
before coming out later

277
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:31,543
and pretending to be the first witness?

278
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:38,258
Are you asking my wife
if she's a murderer?

279
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,515
I thought you dropped your phone again,

280
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:48,017
just like you did
when you found the housekeeper.

281
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:54,774
Was he… watching me that night?

282
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,195
I can prove that it wasn't the case.

283
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,280
How?

284
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:03,867
That day, I was talking on the phone
with my informant

285
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,577
about the location of a scammer.

286
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,829
That's when I found Ms. Jin Myeong-suk.

287
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:13,585
But I think my informant
was watching me at that moment.

288
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:15,170
The informant was Zeus, right?

289
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:16,838
Do you know who he is?

290
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,590
I need find out…

291
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,009
no matter what it takes.

292
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:27,974
It's too much.

293
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:29,809
That's enough.

294
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,200
You think it's that easy?

295
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:48,453
Planting a knife to frame someone.

296
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:52,791
Abducting someone to threaten them
to say what you want to hear.

297
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,877
You have some nerve!

298
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,172
How dare you abduct and threaten someone?

299
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,760
You didn't just threaten her.
You tried to choke her.

300
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,388
That's attempted murder.

301
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:11,518
Did you kill Jin and Cha?
Like you tried to with Seo?

302
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:12,852
I did…

303
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,189
This is exactly why I did it.

304
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:18,900
I knew you'd try to pin the murders on me

305
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,401
and screw me over!

306
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,404
Mr. Cha Geum-sae,
the late actress's brother,

307
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,783
has been arrested for abducting
and assaulting reporter Seo

308
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:28,284
and is being questioned.

309
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,620
Reporter Seo Jeong-won is recovering…

310
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:37,377
I'll be going straight back to work
when I get home tomorrow.

311
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,379
You don't need to come.

312
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:41,506
You're hurt. You should stay here till…

313
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:55,854
Go home.

314
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:57,689
I want to be alone.

315
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,065
Why do you want to be alone?

316
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,569
You make me uncomfortable.

317
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,448
I understand how you feel.

318
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:11,202
But how do you think I'll feel
if I go back home alone,

319
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,037
knowing you're in the hospital?

320
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:17,834
I couldn't rescue you,
and I can't even stay by your side.

321
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,711
What kind of husband does that make me?

322
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,015
I can sleep at a nearby hotel.

323
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,809
If you need my help, call me.

324
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:52,785
Help…

325
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,704
What's this? What's all this money?

326
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,958
Darn it. What do you expect me to do?

327
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:08,092
So, Jin died because you left her there.

328
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,470
I didn't know she'd die.

329
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,184
You clearly heard her asking for help!

330
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,025
This is what Seo said
about the moment she found Jin.

331
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:26,444
"Her upper body
was hanging off the balcony."

332
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:30,365
You ran away
without calling emergency services.

333
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,119
So Jin got herself up there,
asked for help, and eventually died.

334
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,704
She must've really wanted to live.

335
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,005
So, the same person killed Jin and Cha.

336
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,257
Who told you that? Song or Mo?

337
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:53,221
Who ordered you to keep tabs
on Jin Myeong-suk?

338
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,180
It was Mo, right?

339
00:32:55,932 --> 00:33:00,186
He knew all about
you framing Kim Min-cheol, didn't he?

340
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:04,190
Was it your idea?
Or did Mo tell you to do it?

341
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,235
I…

342
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,298
If you feel…

343
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,302
even an ounce of guilt as a human being,

344
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:35,972
tell me the truth.

345
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:17,805
I was going to ask you for it.

346
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:20,933
I offended you.

347
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,811
-What?
-You know, earlier in the day,

348
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,898
when I asked you
if you were hiding in Jin's house.

349
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,277
I would've asked the same question.

350
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:36,032
The day Jin was found dead,
you told me during questioning

351
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,452
that while tracking Lee,
you got Jin's location

352
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:40,995
and found her dead.

353
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:44,040
According to some recent tip-offs,

354
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,084
Lee left the country in August.

355
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:50,338
You were told he was in Owol-dong
on September 2nd.

356
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:51,881
That was a lie.

357
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:59,222
So, I was deliberately led there
to see Jin Myeong-suk.

358
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,975
And I was given the report
on the Bongto case.

359
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:04,560
They're both…

360
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:07,980
connected to Mo Hyeong-taek.

361
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,900
Cha Geum-sae also framed Kim Min-cheol.

362
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,152
Mr. Song knew all about it.

363
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,739
Mr. Song told Cha to keep tabs on Jin.

364
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,116
Cha confessed to everything.

365
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:22,203
And the orders… all came from Mo?

366
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,579
If you want to know,

367
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,707
-write an article.
-I can do that?

368
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:27,917
You must do it,

369
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,503
to officially summon
a party leader for an interview.

370
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,969
Anyway, go back to sleep.

371
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,095
I woke you up.

372
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:41,764
I woke up because I was hungry.

373
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:44,809
What do you want to eat?

374
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:55,444
You should have porridge, not an ice pop.

375
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,362
Are you a kid?

376
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,908
My dad always said the same thing.

377
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,248
I miss my dad.

378
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,839
Ever since Cha Eun-sae died,

379
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:17,133
it's felt like a strange dream.

380
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,428
My husband's betrayal,

381
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,680
running around to find the killer…

382
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,766
and meeting you again.

383
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:38,487
I should stop eating.

384
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,326
It's not good to eat cold stuff.

385
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,252
See? Your hand is so cold.

386
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:00,718
It's so chilly.

387
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,298
It feels like my fault.

388
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,636
When you went to see Cha Geum-sae…

389
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:46,389
I should've stopped you.

390
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:52,019
If something worse had happened, I'd have…

391
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:03,155
You could've gotten badly hurt
because of me.

392
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:12,790
I can't do it.

393
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:17,253
I was warned about falling for you.

394
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,757
I can't do that.

395
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,344
Now that we've met again…

396
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,597
I'll do what my heart says.

397
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:34,645
I must take it all the way.

398
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:44,530
JIHYANG UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

399
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,714
You're leaving already?

400
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:03,507
Why are you here?

401
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:07,345
You're my patient.
Of course I would visit.

402
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,472
I have nothing to say to you.

403
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,766
Well, I do.
And I have something to show you.

404
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,948
You know I tape my sessions,

405
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,408
so let me ask you directly.

406
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:31,619
What's this blood?

407
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,625
You visited Unit 1401 that day.

408
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:42,421
Did you kill Cha
and then come to me to create an alibi?

409
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,885
-Is that what you really think?
-Yes.

410
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,763
I'm convinced you're the killer.

411
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,310
If we test the blood on this shirt,
we'll know the truth.

412
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,812
Even if it's been washed.

413
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,899
If the shirt you wore were missing,

414
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,151
it would be suspicious.

415
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,123
I took care of that shirt.

416
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:20,793
I threw it out in case it bothered her.

417
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,380
It was just a nosebleed.

418
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:26,632
I doubted her at the time too.

419
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:27,591
Sorry about that.

420
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,933
That was a silly thing to do.

421
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:39,019
It won't hide the fact that she's guilty.

422
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,563
-Listen.
-Woo-jae.

423
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,858
Briefly liking him at school was a lie.

424
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,526
I still like him.

425
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:49,029
I think of him, I miss him,
and I want him all the time.

426
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:53,117
Hey, are you out of your mind?

427
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,243
I told you.

428
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:56,662
I'm worried about
you living with a murderer.

429
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,876
I realized as we talked

430
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,879
just how unstable, volatile,
and dangerous you are.

431
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,423
Enough to kill someone.

432
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:12,678
The picture of the shirt
and my medical opinion…

433
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:15,181
I'll submit them to Detective Kim.

434
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,933
That's how I'll save Woo-jae.

435
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,146
Since we're all here,

436
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,273
why not invite the detective?

437
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:31,238
Do you want to lose your license?

438
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,908
Should I tell the detective first?

439
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,618
That I asked you for propofol,

440
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:37,661
and you prescribed it to me illegally?

441
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:46,712
I quit after I met you.

442
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:49,006
But I relapsed after seeing Cha.

443
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:51,342
I'm trying really hard to stay off it now.

444
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:56,305
Now that Jeong-won knows I was addicted,

445
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:59,433
you have no more power
to wield over me, do you?

446
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:03,521
If you want to report her
at the risk of losing everything,

447
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:04,522
be my guest.

448
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,279
Thanks for the visit.

449
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:14,490
Goodbye.

450
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,759
When I studied abroad…

451
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:38,222
I got hooked thanks to incurable insomnia.

452
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,224
There was no turning back.

453
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:45,104
I tried everything I could to quit,
but I failed.

454
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,690
So I went to the sea to kill myself.

455
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:51,735
That's when we met.

456
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:06,083
It's okay to look at the sea as you walk,

457
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:09,420
but it's dangerous to stare at it
when you're standing still.

458
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:23,225
Yes, I'm Seo Jeong-won
from Nothing Uncovered.

459
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:25,144
What's on your mind?

460
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,646
Your shoes are all wet.

461
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:39,033
I was thinking it would be nice…

462
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:40,993
to talk to someone.

463
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:50,544
I never thought of drugs
when I was with you.

464
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:54,006
But just a day earlier…

465
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:56,634
I wanted to die.

466
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:03,140
That's when I realized
that not wanting to live…

467
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:07,811
actually meant that
I wanted to live really well.

468
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,941
That I wanted
to be with this woman forever.

469
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,656
I managed to break free after I met you.

470
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,449
You saved me.

471
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,660
Why couldn't you sleep…

472
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:27,331
even with medication?

473
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:34,004
A girl I liked died in an accident.

474
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:38,217
What accident?

475
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,765
Let's not talk about it.

476
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:49,186
Let's go home.

477
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:04,868
Jeong-won. I'll zip it up for you.

478
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,965
My dear reporter Seo, welcome home.

479
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:20,342
TWO MONTHS AGO

480
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,177
Did you watch my show today?

481
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:23,387
Of course, I did.

482
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:30,185
Novelist Ko Dae-cheol,
who violated his students…

483
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:33,188
I exposed him on my show.

484
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:35,899
You did great.

485
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:42,614
Did I really? He helped you get published.

486
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:46,201
This is why I love you.

487
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:47,995
You're headstrong and decisive.

488
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,209
-What is it?
-Something stings.

489
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,462
-Your shoulder?
-No, the necklace.

490
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:57,713
-My hair.
-Hang on.

491
00:45:57,796 --> 00:45:59,089
It must be tangled.

492
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:03,844
It's off.

493
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:06,013
It's done.

494
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:16,773
CHIEF KANG IN-HAN

495
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:23,655
After your article,
Mo called an emergency press conference.

496
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:24,781
It's live on TV now.

497
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:27,701
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

498
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:31,830
Regarding myself and the late Cha Eun-sae…

499
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:35,834
I'm well aware of the rumors
that I was her sponsor.

500
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:37,920
It's true.

501
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:41,006
I did sponsor Cha Eun-sae.

502
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:46,553
When I moved to a new region
as a prosecutor,

503
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,515
I asked for a list of teens
from broken families

504
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:50,724
and sponsored them.

505
00:46:51,808 --> 00:46:54,019
Cha Eun-sae was one of them.

506
00:46:58,106 --> 00:46:59,525
MO: "I SPONSORED CHA"

507
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:03,987
From the age of 15
until she graduated from high school…

508
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:07,032
I paid her tuition and living expenses.

509
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:08,951
As evidence,

510
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:12,120
I'm disclosing the handwritten letters

511
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:14,581
that Ms. Cha sent me on Father's Day.

512
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,333
-Really?
-Handwritten letters?

513
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:17,584
He helped her financially?

514
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:23,674
Throughout my career as a prosecutor,
or now as a politician,

515
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:25,175
I've only had one goal.

516
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:26,635
MO'S KIND DEEDS

517
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:30,222
The privileges that society gave me,
I wanted to return to the people.

518
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:32,474
My steadfast commitment to my goal

519
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:36,061
helped me endure
all kinds of rumors and attacks.

520
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:40,983
In the upcoming regional elections,

521
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:43,777
I plan to run for Governor of Gangwon-do.

522
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,113
I will allow myself…

523
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:48,532
to be put to the test once again.

524
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:55,122
This is driving me crazy.
Even Mo has an alibi.

525
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:59,167
Everyone on our list has an alibi.

526
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,798
Anyone related to the case
whose alibi hasn't been confirmed?

527
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:07,509
Mo Soo-rin's alibi.

528
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:09,636
MAN WHO DELIVERED CASH

529
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,804
Oh, right.

530
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,181
Remember the factory fire victims?

531
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:15,726
A man delivered Jin's cash donation.

532
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:18,520
I have his police sketch.
I'll send it over right away.

533
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:27,738
This face…

534
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:41,126
What if Yoo Yun-yeong
took the necklace that day?

535
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,509
YOO YUN-YEONG

536
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:54,723
It's me.

537
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:58,894
I couldn't help feeling bad about
what I said earlier.

538
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,105
Are you free tonight?

539
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:10,322
She's crazy. I told you I'd visit you
at the hospital after work.

540
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:11,448
What are you doing here?

541
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:13,575
Gosh. Seriously? I told you to rest up.

542
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:16,161
You might pass out if you don't rest.

543
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:19,665
If I rest and stop working,
I might pass out for real.

544
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:20,666
That can't happen.

545
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:22,250
After reading your article,

546
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:26,463
I thought you'd target Mo Hyeong-taek
on the next episode.

547
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:27,923
What a turn of events.

548
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:31,009
You and Mo must've been arch enemies
in your past lives.

549
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:33,970
Gosh. The fact that he sponsored Cha…

550
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:35,931
I'm sure that he's guilty.

551
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:39,518
Mo Hyeong-taek has an alibi
for the day of Cha's murder.

552
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:40,894
-What?
-Seriously?

553
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:47,693
Your promise to expose the killer
on our show within a month was impossible.

554
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:49,486
Take care of yourself.

555
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:51,947
You can't think straight
in the state you're in.

556
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:54,574
-Where's the rookie?
-Rookie?

557
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:56,410
He called in sick.

558
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:59,329
Is he sick because you're sick?

559
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:07,379
I'm on the rooftop at the precinct.

560
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:09,047
Spare a moment for me.

561
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:19,808
The sketch resembles
your newbie reporter, doesn't it?

562
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:23,311
I guess it does.

563
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:25,147
Where's this from?

564
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:27,399
Jin Myeong-suk withdrew cash every month

565
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:30,402
and donated it to the victims of the fire.

566
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:32,904
He delivered the money to her.

567
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:35,907
Seems like he was very close
to Jin Myeong-suk.

568
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:39,286
Is he at work right now?

569
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:42,414
No. He's on sick leave.

570
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:47,544
It looks like him.
I'll have to call him in for questioning.

571
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:53,049
What is it?

572
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:56,887
The chief called a meeting
at the precinct.

573
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:59,055
He'll probably end up nagging us.

574
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:06,897
I'll give you a ride.

575
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:09,733
Please go home and get some rest.

576
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:12,235
I'm not done talking to my team yet.

577
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,278
I'll get home soon.

578
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,573
I'll call you after the meeting.

579
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:21,578
Bye.

580
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:42,474
Ae-na. Find Ba-reun's home address
and send it to me.

581
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,481
There's a house here?

582
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:18,635
Ba-reun. It's me.

583
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:20,762
Are you home?

584
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:15,734
ARSON CASE
MY HUSBAND'S INNOCENT

585
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:16,985
PROSECUTOR MO

586
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,087
This is Detective Kim's location.

587
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:39,966
Can we talk?

588
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:49,809
This is Detective Kim's location.

589
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:09,788
So, it was you?

590
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:14,459
You're… Zeus?

591
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:18,213
Lee Ba-reun.

592
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,032
This is such an honor.

593
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,577
I don't have anything on you anymore.

594
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:51,246
But you're spending time with me.

595
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:06,302
Yun-yeong.

596
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:11,099
Why do you still like me?

597
00:55:17,313 --> 00:55:18,773
I've never been kind to you.

598
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:20,984
I always pushed you away.

599
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:22,569
Don't you hate me?

600
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:26,072
Always.

601
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,033
I've always hated you.

602
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,160
But the problem is…

603
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:33,455
I never stopped liking you.

604
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,752
You're quite a determined man.

605
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:41,713
You stopped the drug abuse
when you began dating Seo.

606
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:45,550
I kept throwing myself at you,
but you never crossed the line.

607
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,679
Am I not attractive as a woman?

608
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:54,017
You could have given in
at least once, couldn't you?

609
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:58,354
Giving false hopes and causing pain
is one of the worst things you can do.

610
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:02,776
I never wanted to date you,
so giving in to your advances…

611
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:05,987
wouldn't have been a nice thing
to do to a friend.

612
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:10,366
Who cares about being nice?

613
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:14,496
So what if it comes with pain?
Love and pain go hand in hand.

614
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:17,999
You're also hurting
because you love your wife.

615
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:29,928
Speaking for myself,
you've never been mine.

616
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:30,845
Hence the obsession.

617
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:34,390
But why are you so obsessed
with your wife?

618
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:41,481
I'm afraid she'd leave me.

619
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:44,943
That she might…

620
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,196
abandon me.

621
00:56:56,704 --> 00:56:58,289
Between never getting something

622
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:01,292
and losing what was once yours…

623
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:05,213
which one do you think would
drive you more insane?

624
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:09,634
Neither of us…

625
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:12,929
is good at loving someone.

626
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:19,894
I want you to be lonelier…

627
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:22,897
and more miserable.

628
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,443
I hope the days you cry

629
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:29,154
outnumber the days that you smile.

630
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:33,825
That way…

631
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:38,163
you'll keep coming to me.

632
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:29,214
ENTER PASSCODE

633
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:33,384

00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:32,026
SEO JEONG-WON

635
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:06,519
It was because of me.

636
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,272
I was the reason for it.

637
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:13,610
That's why you set Jeong-won up.

638
01:01:38,986 --> 01:01:40,405
Hello, Detective Kim.

639
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:51,791
You must be wondering why I'm here.

640
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:56,921
I'm here because of Ms. Seo.

641
01:02:58,149 --> 01:03:00,359
She left your necklace at the scene,

642
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,487
but has a confirmed alibi. That means…

643
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:05,198
She either had an accomplice
or hired someone to kill her.

644
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:08,367
Your insecurity about never being liked
manifested in murder.

645
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:10,036
Are you such a monster?

646
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,829
Do you have the right to say that?

647
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:15,416
Seriously, do not contact or meet
reporter Seo for the time being.

648
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,375
Are you crazy?

649
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:19,003
She asked me not to have feelings for her,
but I couldn't do it.

650
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:20,379
Jeong-won did nothing wrong.

651
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:21,464
Don't cry.

652
01:03:22,089 --> 01:03:23,883
It's my fault that
the article was published.

653
01:03:24,383 --> 01:03:26,719
Don't worry. I'll protect you.

654
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:28,721
Yesterday, Yoo Yun-yeong showed me photos

655
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:31,140
of Jeong-won next to Cha's dead body.

656
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:33,351
That said, help me.

657
01:03:33,434 --> 01:03:35,937
You're going to arrest me
for murdering Cha Eun-sae?

658
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:38,397
I'll handle them. Just don't get hurt.

659
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:40,483
Let's stay like this for just a minute.
