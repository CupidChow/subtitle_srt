1
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:49,340
All locations, people, organizations, and
incidents in this drama are fictitious.

2
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,892
Unit 1401, Leaders Palace
for appointment at 7:20 p.m.

3
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,906
Security cameras
will be installed everywhere

4
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:14,282
except in the parking lot
and main entrance.

5
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:35,845
The door is closing.

6
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,584
I don't believe this.

7
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,087
Hey.

8
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,089
Ms. Cha Eun-sae.

9
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,482
CHIEF KANG IN-HAN

10
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,239
I have great news for you.

11
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,159
-Sorry?
-I met with the CEO

12
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:24,329
and recommended you as Anchorman Lee's
successor for the nine o'clock news.

13
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,123
Until the CEO makes his decision
to pick you,

14
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:29,542
you'd better stay out of trouble.
Do you understand?

15
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,263
Are you listening?

16
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,016
Why are you so quiet?
Don't be such a downer.

17
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,648
Wait, are those sirens?

18
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,150
Where are you?

19
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,160
I'll call you later.

20
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,364
Oh, my God.

21
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,660
I'm so glad I ran into you here.

22
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:49,539
It's Unit 1201, not 1401.
I sent you the wrong number.

23
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,126
I'm sorry. Did you go
all the way up to the 14th floor?

24
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,210
Yes.

25
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,922
The corridor was all dark,
so I came right down.

26
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,757
I came here hoping to find you.

27
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,759
I tried calling you,
but you didn't pick up.

28
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,679
I must have missed it.

29
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,556
Shall we go?

30
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:20,695
Jeong-won?

31
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,406
Jeong-won.

32
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,159
Yes.

33
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,290
Why do you think
you suddenly experienced hyperventilation?

34
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,001
Are you under a lot of stress,
or angry about something?

35
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,211
Or did you experience
some kind of emotional shock?

36
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,507
What exactly happened?

37
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,847
I got into an argument with an informant.

38
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,149
Would you say

39
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,027
you were overly agitated?

40
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:05,823
Stay calm.

41
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,201
I'm sure she didn't see it.

42
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,287
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

43
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:18,920
I was quite agitated earlier,

44
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,089
but now that I'm here,

45
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,132
I feel calm.

46
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:26,052
That shows me how much you trust me.

47
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,639
That's why I care about you
more than my other patients.

48
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,532
Security cameras
will be installed everywhere

49
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:48,991
except in the parking lot
and main entrance.

50
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,799
No cameras in the elevator
or in the 14th floor corridor.

51
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,467
They won't have footage of me.

52
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:13,224
LEADERS PALACE
WE WELCOME OUR NEW RESIDENTS.

53
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:29,323
The sirens had nothing to do
with Cha Eun-sae, after all.

54
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,408
What was I thinking,
coming home like this?

55
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,910
Why did I run away?

56
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,832
Jeong-won, are you in there?

57
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:31,761
I'm sorry.

58
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,973
I was stressed out,
so I drank quite a bit.

59
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,643
Stressed out about what?

60
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,105
The truth is…

61
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,403
for the past few days…

62
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,407
I haven't been able to write at all.

63
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,960
I'm so frustrated.

64
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,324
-A murder?
-Yes. It's a celebrity.

65
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:40,204
DO NOT ENTER - POLICE LINE

66
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:53,050
We barely got started
on the Jin Myeong-suk case.

67
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:54,594
What a headache.

68
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:58,097
Killers don't check our schedule
before murdering someone.

69
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,017
Just like Jin, Cha was stabbed
multiple times in the stomach.

70
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,315
A lethal blow.

71
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,693
-Murder weapon?
-None. Her wallet and phone are gone too.

72
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,787
-Did you photograph this?
-No.

73
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:22,830
Do it now.

74
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:34,717
It's snapped.

75
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,053
Could it belong to the killer?
Maybe it broke in the scuffle.

76
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,512
Or it could be hers.

77
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,728
What is this place?

78
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,855
Cha Eun-sae's personal agency.

79
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,357
They were preparing to open.

80
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:05,873
What?

81
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,000
This is a strange coincidence.

82
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:12,129
You mean,
the clock at Jin Myeong-suk's crime scene?

83
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,631
I wondered about that too.

84
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:16,133
Then again,
most of the stuff here doesn't work.

85
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:18,719
Who found her?

86
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,388
Two men who came to do the interiors.

87
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:23,099
Tae-heon, the building's interior work
isn't finished yet--

88
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,600
I know. Get footage from the cameras

89
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:26,560
at the main entrance
and basement parking level.

90
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,728
Got it.

91
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:30,648
Here you go.

92
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,443
The other cameras
including the ones at the back

93
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,778
were going to be installed today.

94
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,531
Why did this have to happen yesterday?

95
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:39,990
Isn't it obvious?

96
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:42,118
It had to be done yesterday.

97
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:54,463
It was the ideal opportunity to do it
without being caught on camera.

98
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,258
The killer would have planned the murder

99
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,718
taking into account
the day the cameras would be installed.

100
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:06,142
Either they obtained information
that Cha would be at the office…

101
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,730
or they lured her there on purpose.

102
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:14,984
It's one or the other.

103
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,948
They stabbed her many times, viciously,
while facing her.

104
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,701
So they could watch her suffer.

105
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,287
Do you think it was someone with a grudge?

106
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,830
What could their motive be?

107
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,416
Money? Love? Revenge?

108
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,344
CHA EUN-SAE

109
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,390
Cha, beautiful in white

110
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,186
Darling.

111
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,023
You startled me.

112
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,107
Sorry.

113
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,027
Did you do all this

114
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,905
to celebrate
the anniversary of my first novel?

115
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,699
I had no idea.

116
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:05,743
Sorry for coming home late and drunk.

117
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,329
Where did you go drinking, and with whom?

118
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,831
At my studio, alone.

119
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,218
I'm sorry.

120
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:29,725
I have bad news!

121
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,561
It's crazy!

122
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,314
Cha Eun-sae is dead!

123
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,273
What?

124
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:39,151
What tabloid did you get that from?

125
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,278
-I'm sure she's not dead.
-It's true.

126
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,198
The newsflash will come on
in five minutes.

127
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,535
Breaking news.
At around 5:00 a.m. on the 7th,

128
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:51,455
actress Cha Eun-sae was found dead
at her agency office in Gangha-gu.

129
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:54,917
Two men working on the interiors
found her and called the police.

130
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,378
The police suspect it's a murder,

131
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,880
and are working on finding
the cause of death.

132
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:04,510
Her agency has not yet made
an official announcement about the news.

133
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:07,179
And so that the deceased
can rest in peace,

134
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,306
-they've requested the media not to…
-I was right.

135
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,393
What was she like when you met her?

136
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,981
Urgent. Contact me immediately.

137
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,111
That means she died
the day after you met her.

138
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,696
Right?

139
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,657
Gosh. You must feel terrible.

140
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,788
-Yes?
-You met Cha Eun-sae two days ago?

141
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:33,998
Come to my office now.

142
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,045
She gave you no information at all?

143
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,382
You said she wanted to meet
to give you a tip-off.

144
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,508
Was there nothing?

145
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,302
It was a lie.

146
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,012
She just needed someone to talk to.

147
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,431
And here I thought we had a scoop.

148
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,184
But I guess her murder is a scoop.

149
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:58,188
Work on a script
that'll get us the highest ratings ever.

150
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,232
It might be your last show, after all.

151
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,320
They got a one-month replacement
for the anchorman for now.

152
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,572
They'll announce a new presenter
next month.

153
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:09,909
You want to use this opportunity
to appeal to the big boss.

154
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,201
You hear me?

155
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,414
If it's too much for you,
I'll give the job to Ji-ho.

156
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,959
I'll work on the Cha murder

157
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,128
after I'm done with
the marriage con artist story.

158
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,357
MAIN ENTRANCE
BASEMENT

159
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:45,569
Are you sure these are the only cameras
that were working?

160
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:46,695
Yes.

161
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,536
ZEUS

162
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,707
SECURITY
RESTRICTED AREA - STAFF ONLY

163
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,001
What? Is it about Cha Eun-sae's death?

164
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:04,546
Yes. I want the visitor list
from yesterday for Leaders Palace.

165
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,757
The cameras have too many blind spots.

166
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,592
Get me the visitors' GPS records.

167
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,810
-It was murder, right?
-Yes.

168
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,770
There are small defense wounds on her arm.

169
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,816
Cause of death: excessive bleeding
from a ruptured abdominal aorta.

170
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:27,736
Estimated time of death is between
5:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. on October 6th.

171
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,906
Same cause of death as Jin Myeong-suk?

172
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:35,828
If you're stabbed in the stomach,
it usually causes excessive bleeding.

173
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,125
What's the width?

174
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,543
Based on the length,

175
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:45,629
the knife couldn't be much bigger
than a fruit knife.

176
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,800
That's identical to the Jin case too.

177
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,012
How many stab wounds were there?

178
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,764
You said Jin was stabbed multiple times
in the same spot.

179
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,183
Now that you mention it,
that is identical.

180
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:02,187
The killer stabbed Cha multiple times
in the same spot too?

181
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,984
Are the two cases connected in any way?

182
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:10,571
No. How could the deaths of a housekeeper
and a celebrity be connected?

183
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:12,281
Two murders in a row

184
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:15,325
have made him more sensitive
than my wife with three kids.

185
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,869
If you know how sensitive I am,

186
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:19,747
why haven't you brought me
Jin's bank statements yet?

187
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,749
Sorry, sir.
I'll get them for you right away.

188
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,505
Want to hear something shocking?

189
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:30,883
Did you find drugs?

190
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:34,428
Cha Eun-sae was three months pregnant.

191
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,388
What?

192
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,862
It has to be a grudge plus love combo.

193
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,073
Get Cha's medical records
and call history.

194
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,157
Got it.

195
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:10,005
Oh, look.
A missed call from my sweetheart.

196
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,802
We'll be issuing a statement soon.

197
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,929
I know a little about the scene.

198
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,556
I just need a yes-or-no answer
to check some facts.

199
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:21,600
You have five minutes.

200
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:25,562
I heard Cha was stabbed in the stomach.

201
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:26,647
So she was murdered?

202
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,525
Estimated time of death?

203
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,985
Between 5:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m.
on October 6th.

204
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:37,324
Did you find anything crucial
at the scene, like a weapon or prints?

205
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,326
Do you have a suspect?
Have you identified someone?

206
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:44,081
The body was found at dawn today.
How could we have a suspect already?

207
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:48,001
I heard something about it,
off the record.

208
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:49,920
Was Cha Eun-sae

209
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:51,755
really pregnant?

210
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:54,800
Who told you that?

211
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:58,470
Thanks for your cooperation.

212
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,264
Wait. Who told you that?

213
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,349
I gave you something,
and I want something back.

214
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,017
I got a tip-off. How else would I know?

215
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,410
I love your husband.

216
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:24,079
And your husband loves me back.

217
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,009
Welcome home!

218
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:38,844
You must be hungry.

219
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,597
I'm almost done.

220
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,855
I'm sorry.

221
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,858
I won't drink like that again.
Don't be mad.

222
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,234
Please?

223
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,612
Did you read the article

224
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,072
about Cha Eun-sae's murder?

225
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,241
Yes.

226
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,707
Cha Eun-sae gave this to me.

227
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,302
She called me the day before she died.
So I went to meet her.

228
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,679
You know what she told me?

229
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,514
That you and her were in love.

230
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,058
She asked me to divorce you.

231
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:27,893
What?

232
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,895
What do you think?
Was she telling the truth?

233
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:35,817
Did she…

234
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,572
really say that?

235
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,241
She must've had a good reason
for telling me.

236
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,327
Did you…

237
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:48,747
cheat on me with her?

238
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,756
Hold on.

239
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,779
Cha Eun-sae gave this to me.

240
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,744
Congratulations on publishing your novel.
I'd like to give this present in person…

241
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,454
I met her once last year
at a get-together.

242
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,789
So I'm sending it via courier.
From Cha Eun-sae

243
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,249
She was offered to publish an essay.

244
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:34,418
Afterwards she asked around
and got my phone number.

245
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,295
She texted she was lonely,
asked me to buy her a drink.

246
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,005
She hit on me, made me uncomfortable.

247
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,131
When my book got published,

248
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,341
she sent me a cologne and this card
to my publishing house.

249
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,176
I found it a few days ago

250
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,554
when I was cleaning my study.

251
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,517
She thought you two were in love,
when you met only once last year?

252
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:55,689
I blocked her number
because she kept hounding me with calls.

253
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,109
This is her number.

254
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:01,611
BLOCKED NUMBERS

255
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:04,823
I didn't tell you about it
because I didn't want you to worry.

256
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,408
That was over a year ago.

257
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,493
I can't believe she made up such nonsense.

258
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,078
I don't even know what to say.

259
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:13,582
So you

260
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,668
really didn't cheat on me with her?

261
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,920
I showed you everything.

262
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,590
I explained what happened.

263
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,924
But you still suspect me?

264
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,260
She gave me a sonogram!
How could I not suspect you?

265
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:26,511
Jeong-won!

266
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,807
How could you believe I cheated on you
and knocked her up?

267
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:34,061
Why would Cha Eun-sae lie
about something like that?

268
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,520
That's what I would like to ask her!

269
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:38,023
If she wasn't dead…

270
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,819
I'd like to ask her
why she made up such a crazy lie.

271
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,321
I wish I could confront her.

272
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:52,746
I don't know…

273
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,250
what more I can do
to prove that she was lying to you.

274
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,460
What can I do?

275
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,128
Tell me.

276
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,214
Yesterday afternoon,

277
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,217
why did you go
to the marriage counseling clinic?

278
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,929
-Did you follow me?
-Why did you go to the clinic?

279
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,266
To see a psychiatrist, for depression.

280
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,895
They say it's because I'm lonely.

281
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,859
So I've been seeing a psychiatrist
for a month now.

282
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:29,449
It's embarrassing for me to admit

283
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:31,743
that I'm weak.

284
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,454
I hate it.

285
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,684
That necklace.
It's a Harry Joyce piece, isn't it?

286
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,102
It's so pretty.

287
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,521
My husband got it for me.

288
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:03,191
We're in a relationship.
He bought this necklace for me too.

289
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:09,239
She was so obsessed with him
that she even lied about the necklace.

290
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,436
What are you looking for?

291
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,022
I can't find the necklace
you bought for me.

292
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,067
Maybe it's at the office.

293
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,237
Like when you thought
you lost that bracelet I got you.

294
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,241
I'll look for it when I get to work.

295
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,495
I made the vegetable juice for you.
Drink it before you go.

296
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,208
It's my fault.

297
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,840
I didn't know you were feeling lonely.

298
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:11,259
I should've been more attentive.

299
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,762
I know it won't be easy,

300
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:17,307
but I'll try my best to make time for you
from now on.

301
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:19,935
It's not your fault.

302
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,272
I'm just pathetic and weak.

303
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,192
Don't say that.

304
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:29,402
You're making me feel worse.

305
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,658
You ought to be sorry about the necklace.

306
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,201
Do you know how much it cost me?

307
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,041
Goodness.

308
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:18,994
-Okay?
-I got it.

309
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:25,041
This isn't your home.
You should learn to knock.

310
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,502
I have nothing to say to a thief
who stole my project.

311
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:30,255
You said you had a lot on your plate.

312
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:33,591
I heard you couldn't even start
investigating Cha Eun-sae's case.

313
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:36,052
I've obtained confidential information
about her case.

314
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,805
So who's it going to be, me or him?

315
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,225
You want me to leave?

316
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,471
What's this confidential information
you have?

317
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,601
Cha Eun-sae was pregnant.

318
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,354
My God! Really?

319
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,566
This will go down in history
as the most shocking scoop.

320
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:32,734
I told you I'd work on it.

321
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,028
Now stop testing me.
You're making me angry.

322
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,702
Okay, let's begin.

323
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:48,458
Tell us how you met your husband,
how you two got married.

324
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,879
We met at a club event.

325
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,968
I was attracted to him
because he was sweet and kind.

326
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,639
Until that incident took place
after we got married,

327
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,516
he was the perfect husband.

328
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:09,979
I'll give you a piggyback ride.

329
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,231
You look gorgeous.

330
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:12,440
It's Seo Jeong-won.

331
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,825
When he was taking a shower,
I heard a phone vibrate.

332
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:24,452
Your phone's ringing.
I can hear it vibrating.

333
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,412
Not mine.

334
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:29,958
I found a second phone in his bag.
That's when I figured out everything.

335
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:35,255
It must be our upstairs neighbor's phone.
I heard it a few days ago too.

336
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:39,259
I found out that
his name and family were all fake.

337
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:46,808
It's infuriating that, of all people,
I was betrayed by my own husband.

338
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,311
I can neither trust

339
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,148
nor meet anyone now.

340
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,863
You've done a brave thing
by coming forward with your story.

341
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:02,323
You can get your life back
once your husband gets caught.

342
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:03,867
I'll help you.

343
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:12,876
Hey, guys.

344
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,627
I know you're wondering,

345
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:17,630
what kind of brother does a live-stream
at his sister's funeral?

346
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:22,051
But you know what? I want this to reach
as many people as possible.

347
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:26,473
I believe it's my duty as her brother,
so I hope you all understand. Yes.

348
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,516
Please subscribe to my channel
and like the video.

349
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,851
Could you stop that for a moment?

350
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,312
One moment, guys. I have to greet a guest.

351
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:36,608
LIEUTENANT KIM TAE-HEON
GANGHA POLICE STATION

352
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:42,071
You're the detective
in charge of the case?

353
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,281
Yes, I am.

354
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:46,409
Could you come by the station
after the funeral?

355
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,286
We need to interview you
as one of the witnesses.

356
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,704
As a witness?

357
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,081
Sure. If you need me, I'll be there.

358
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:55,710
You probably know the passcode
for Cha Eun-sae's front door?

359
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,546
It looks like
I have to work late again today.

360
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,757
Come on, don't be mad at me.

361
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,634
Okay, all right.

362
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,720
Tell me you got the footage
from the parking lot

363
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,222
and the vehicle entry and exit records.

364
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,473
There was nothing important.

365
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,141
Cha's manager and her brother
were the only visitors.

366
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,851
I guess her boyfriend
didn't bring his car,

367
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,020
or he gave a different unit number
if he visited her.

368
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:15,814
What about the analysis on the necklace?

369
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,524
The only thing they found
was Cha Eun-sae's blood.

370
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:18,817
They can tell it's expensive,

371
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,528
but there was no pendant,
so they need more time.

372
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,782
Why are you wearing a suit?
Did you have a blind date?

373
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,408
I did make a move on someone.

374
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:37,168
I hear Cha Eun-sae's brother
is an attention-seeking streamer.

375
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,170
I watched a few of his videos.

376
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:42,507
He talks about his sister
and tries to provoke people. How boring.

377
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,184
HOT SHOT
BY SEOL WOO-JAE

378
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:56,396
HIGH RISK BY SEOL WOO-JAE
BLUE MURDERER BY SEOL WOO-JAE

379
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:04,529
I see matching items
that a couple would have, but no pictures.

380
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:05,697
And no cell phones.

381
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,720
How long back
does the security footage go?

382
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:30,221
A week. Why?

383
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,849
She was a celebrity, probably on a diet.

384
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:35,059
Do you think she bought this cake herself?

385
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,312
Or did a visitor pick this up for her?

386
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:49,115
Who records a vlog
at their sister's funeral?

387
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:53,036
-Is he a psychopath or a lunatic?
-Probably both.

388
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:56,164
Where's our guest with the cake?
Let me find you.

389
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,624
Where are you?

390
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:58,958
Gotcha!

391
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:02,587
What is it?
Did you see a ghost or something?

392
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,005
Take a look at this.

393
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,967
You'd think you'd seen a ghost too.

394
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:17,852
Why is Seo Jeong-won…

395
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,230
I heard a phone vibrate.

396
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:26,235
I found a second phone in his bag.
That's when I figured out everything.

397
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,948
I heard a phone vibrate.

398
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:34,077
I found a second phone in his bag.
That's when I figured out everything.

399
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:39,457
I found out that
his name and family were all fake.

400
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:44,462
He took out loans on my credit card,
used the phone in my name.

401
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:47,006
He was a con man
who had been married three times,

402
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,132
but I had no idea--

403
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,264
Give me a call when you get this.

404
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,349
ZEUS

405
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,229
ZEUS

406
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,151
I have one more favor to ask.

407
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,988
I don't mind. Means more money for me.
What do you want?

408
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:13,032
Find out how many cell phones
are registered under Woo-jae's name.

409
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,492
If you find more than two,

410
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:16,911
send me the numbers.

411
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:20,289
Are you sure?

412
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:24,752
What is it? Are you afraid
your husband might be cheating on you?

413
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,092
MAIN ENTRANCE

414
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,060
She was caught on this camera too.

415
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,230
The time window matches too.

416
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:46,482
You think she's our killer?

417
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:47,942
Around 7:30 p.m.

418
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,715
I came to ask you a few questions
about Cha Eun-sae.

419
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,021
-The cake at Cha Eun-sae's place--
-Yes.

420
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:27,815
I picked it up.

421
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,984
Why didn't you tell me
you hung out at her place?

422
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,277
I didn't go there to hang out.

423
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,196
She called me there
saying she had a lead for me.

424
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:35,364
So she had your number.

425
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:38,659
No, she said she'd asked her manager
to get my number.

426
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,870
So that was the first time she called you

427
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:42,705
and the first time you met her?

428
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:46,542
She'd never called me before,
but it was my second time meeting her.

429
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,544
I met her once about a month ago.

430
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,217
What was the lead about?

431
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,137
It was a lie.
She just wanted to befriend me.

432
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,431
I was expecting a big scoop.

433
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:01,974
I was disappointed.

434
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,603
You asked me
all those questions about the case,

435
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,855
and you didn't mention
that you met her the day before?

436
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:09,941
It wasn't important.

437
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:11,984
I didn't think
it was relevant to the case.

438
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,320
Any more questions?

439
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:21,869
I'm just getting started.

440
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,168
The envelope Cha Eun-sae gave you,

441
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,171
you want to tell me what was in it?

442
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:37,218
What did you say to her
that she slapped you in the face?

443
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,680
According to the timestamps
on the security footage,

444
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:44,225
you left Cha Eun-sae's place
and came straight to the police station.

445
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,187
And when I dropped you home,

446
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,856
I saw you crying in my car.

447
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,195
Did something happen
between you and Cha Eun-sae?

448
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,365
-No.
-Then answer my questions.

449
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:01,701
What was in that envelope,
and why did she slap you?

450
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:07,248
It's a personal matter,

451
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,500
so I'm not obligated
to answer your questions.

452
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:17,800
What were you doing at Leaders Palace
at 7:30 p.m. on October 6th?

453
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,557
You need to answer this question
because it concerns your alibi.

454
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:34,483
I had an appointment
at You & Me Neuropsychiatric Clinic.

455
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,736
Check with them if you don't believe me.

456
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:37,820
Are we done now?

457
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,532
Are you going to keep me here
and interrogate me?

458
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:44,785
Detective Kim Tae-heon.

459
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:48,581
Don't you think you're standing
a little too close to me?

460
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:26,327
We only found five books
at Cha Eun-sae's place.

461
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,999
And they were all novels
by Mr. Seol Woo-jae.

462
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,753
The fierce Seo Jeong-won
was invited to an actress's place.

463
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:37,171
She saw something there.

464
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,006
She got slapped, and later cried.

465
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,634
Was something going on
between her and your husband?

466
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:43,386
Like…

467
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,305
an affair?

468
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:50,142
I don't need to answer
your absurd questions.

469
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,436
If this "absurd" speculation
turns out to be true,

470
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,729
should I tell you?

471
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,273
Hey, watch what you say.

472
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,067
You said it yourself,

473
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,903
that we should always
talk to each other politely.

474
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,448
Do you want to talk casually
now that we're alone?

475
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,118
Can you not stand the fact
that I, of all people,

476
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,452
am interrogating you like this?

477
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,587
Ms. Seo Jeong-won!

478
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,300
Sorry for returning it so late.

Do you have more questions?

00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,411
Give me your number.

483
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,581
So you can bother me?

That's how people get closer.

485
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,086

486
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,130
I left it in my car.

00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,093

I am, but I'm offended.

I'm pleased.

I'm single too.

we'll end up dating?

You seemed okay for a while.

Hello, Father.

506
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:14,615
Sure.

507
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:17,952
He wants to meet for breakfast.

508
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,317
Long time no see, Ms. Seo.

509
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:55,155
Are you still upset
she uncovered you on television?

510
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,574
Not at all.

511
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:01,996
Thanks to her,
I got some sense knocked into me.

512
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:06,083
I heard you never apologized to him.

513
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:10,504
I know viewer ratings are important,

514
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,090
but attacking someone viciously
is never good.

515
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:17,511
You should apologize
for being out of line.

516
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:20,097
Father,

517
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,560
if you demand an apology
in a setting like this--

518
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:32,610
It's a shame that
my show uncovered your shortcomings,

519
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,069
but I'm not sorry about it.

520
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:38,824
I care more about my viewers' right
to know the truth, than my ratings.

521
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,952
If I were to grovel
as if I had done something wrong,

522
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,163
wouldn't that be
a bigger disgrace, Father?

523
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,842
You really are something. Feisty.

524
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:01,347
Seo Sang-gyeon was a lot like this too.

525
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:08,562
How do you know her late father?

526
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,483
We met a few times
when I was a prosecutor.

527
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:17,946
You really are a lot like him.

528
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:28,874
I'll see you soon.

529
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:37,466
Good-bye, Father.

530
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,029
I need to take this. Sorry.

531
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:00,989
Hello?

532
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,285
My father--

533
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:08,497
Ms. Seo, are you happy these days?

534
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,083
Yes.

535
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:15,045
You don't seem so happy, though.

536
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:19,258
I think you married the wrong guy.

537
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:23,011
What makes you say that?

538
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:25,222
Just…

539
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:27,850
a hunch.

540
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,030
Sorry.

541
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,783
Yes. That's fine.

542
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:52,958
Sir, a call from Kim Tae-heon,
the detective.

543
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:57,421
Hello, it's Kim Tae-heon.

544
00:45:57,504 --> 00:46:01,550
I asked Mr. Song to put me through,
and he told me to call at 1:00 p.m.

545
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:03,594
Is this about my housekeeper's death?

546
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:08,098
Yes. We took a look at the transactions
in her bank statements.

547
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:11,435
She withdrew most of the money
the day after she got paid,

548
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:12,478
which is quite odd.

549
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:15,230
Did she? Was she in debt?

550
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:16,190
No, she wasn't.

551
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:20,819
Did she tell you anything
about what it was for,

552
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:23,280
or did she ask you for a loan?

553
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:24,823
No, she didn't.

554
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,494
What did she spend it on?

555
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:31,455
We don't have much to go on.
She didn't have many friends.

556
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:34,124
-Please ask your daughter about it.
-I will.

557
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:39,338
How dare he tell me what to do.

558
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:41,131
How frustrating.

559
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,300
There's no call history,

560
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:45,093
and she withdrew most of her pay.

561
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:49,556
Where do you think Jin spent
all her hard-earned money?

562
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:51,975
Was she gambling?

563
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,436
Or was she paying off a blackmailer?

564
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:58,857
When we questioned Assemblyman Mo,

565
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:01,151
do you remember how he reacted

566
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:04,238
when we showed him
Jin's scrapbook with his articles?

567
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:10,452
Are you aware that
Ms. Jin collected articles about you?

568
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:11,995
Mo Hyeong-taek selected as
Top 10 teen role model

569
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,247
No, I wasn't.

570
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:15,958
Why did she collect stuff about me?

571
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:21,797
Did he really not know,
or did he pretend not to know?

572
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:24,550
If he's hiding something,

573
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:27,636
maybe it means
they were getting up to no good in secret.

574
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:32,057
Let's just follow the trail
we have right now.

575
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:38,564
Excuse me.

576
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:42,276
-Can you confirm something for us?
-What do you need?

577
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:43,819
We're from Gangha Police Station.

578
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:46,446
Okay. Hello.

579
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:52,494
Let's see.

580
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:56,206
Ms. Seo came in on October 6th
at 7:44 p.m.,

581
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,916
and she paid at 8:30 p.m.

582
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,751
CONSULTATION: COMPLETE
TIME AND DATE OF PAYMENT

583
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:05,048
So why do you want to know
what time Ms. Seo came in?

584
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:07,968
It's just one of those things
we always check. Thanks.

585
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,808
YOU & ME NEUROPSYCHIATRIC CLINIC
DIRECTOR YOO YUN-YEONG

586
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:22,941
Man, what a bummer this is.

587
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,070
That's a nice car you've got right there.

588
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,038
Oh, hello.

589
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:59,978
-Shall we begin the interview now?
-Sure.

590
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:04,274
Mr. Cha Geum-sae, what were you doing
on the day of Cha Eun-sae's death?

591
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:05,942
Well,

592
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:07,778
I worked out all day.

593
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:12,282
I met up with my buddies at night
for drinks. That's it.

594
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:13,700
Did you go to Leaders Palace?

595
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:15,494
No.

596
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:17,454
But you did.

597
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:22,000
BASEMENT

598
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:36,682
You know, the thing is, I've been parking
my car at Eun-sae's office building lately

599
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:38,183
and riding my bicycle afterward.

600
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:41,812
Did you go to your sister's office
after you parked your car that day?

601
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:43,355
No.

602
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:46,817
She told me not to visit her.
She even threw a fit about it.

603
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:50,153
So I've been to her office just once.

604
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:56,284
But I did use
the first-floor restroom that day.

605
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:59,579
Riding a bicycle is great and all,
but my bladder--

606
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,540
Did you ride the bicycle alone?

607
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:04,084
Yes. You must ride the bicycle alone
to truly enjoy it.

608
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:08,422
Besides, it's difficult for regular people
to keep up with me.

609
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:12,467
Especially since I have thighs
as muscular as a horse's.

610
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:13,385
Like Son Heung-min.

611
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:19,933
Just answer my questions.

612
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:26,940
When did you start and finish
riding your bicycle

613
00:50:27,023 --> 00:50:28,400
on the day of the incident?

614
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:31,111
I parked my car at 4:00 p.m.

615
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:33,113
Was I gone for about three hours?
I'm not sure.

616
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:34,239
You have a gambling debt?

617
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:38,243
Gambling?

618
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:42,247
I just played a few rounds for fun.
That's all.

619
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:44,291
You live in a low-rise apartment
in Onjeong-dong.

620
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:47,252
You fell behind on your rent,
used up the security deposit you put down.

621
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:50,046
I was going to move into
Eun-sae's house soon.

622
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,841
Getting the deposit back is always
a hassle, so I stopped paying rent.

623
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:53,967
"Move into her house"?

624
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:58,346
Sounds as if you already knew
she was going to die.

625
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,431
What?

626
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:08,690
Eun-sae and I talked about moving in
together even before she died. Okay?

627
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:11,902
You said she threw a fit to keep you
from visiting her at her office.

628
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:14,279
And now you tell me
you were going to move in together.

629
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:16,656
Come on. Are you kidding me?

630
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,241
You really think I killed her?

631
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:20,827
How could a cop suspect
the victim's brother

632
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:23,246
when he's just lost his only sister?

633
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:26,082
Is this how you cops treat
the bereaved family?

634
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:27,876
Cha Eun-sae was pregnant.

635
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:32,130
Did you know that?

636
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:35,675
This means
she was probably seeing someone.

637
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,385
Can you think of anyone?

638
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:46,520
I have an appointment.
I must get going now.

639
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,146
You know the novelist Seol Woo-jae?

640
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:50,357
He's been on TV quite a lot.

641
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:54,069
You mean, the husband of that lady
who hosts Nothing Exposed or something?

642
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:55,070
Seo Jeong-won?

643
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:59,282
Did your sister and Seol Woo-jae
know each other?

644
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:07,082
Mr. Detective…

645
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:13,213
How would I know something like that?

646
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:15,924
Seriously.

647
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:32,107
ZEUS

648
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,819
Only one phone is registered
under Seol Woo-jae's name.

649
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:40,323
-Thank you.
-But…

650
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:44,202
SUBSCRIBER SEARCHING SERVICE

651
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:48,498
He runs a one-man publishing corporation,
and a phone is registered under it.

652
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:53,295
I didn't even think about that.

653
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:54,963
What's the number?

654
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:58,300
0-1-0-0-2-3-4-7-8-2-7.

655
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:01,386
Can you track it?

656
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:09,769
It's turned off.

657
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:17,068
Let's say he used the second phone
to communicate with only one person.

658
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:21,323
Now, if he can't reach that person anymore
he wouldn't carry it around, would he?

659
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:22,449
Probably not.

660
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:26,036
I'll wire your fee.

661
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:12,248
Hold on. Could you zoom in on that?

662
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:34,229
Ms. Seo Jeong-won,
Unit 205, Mujin Prestige

663
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:54,249
MESSAGE

664
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:57,252
RECENTS

665
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:59,337
NO CALL HISTORY

666
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:20,775
It'll take a few days.

667
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,485
Call me as soon as you restore the data.

668
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:23,570
You got it.

669
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,629
Eun-sae said she would pay
my last month's salary

670
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:43,465
along with this month's salary.

671
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,092
So?

672
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,553
Do I look like Cha Eun-sae to you?

673
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:51,222
-Ridiculous.
-God!

674
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:52,974
My fist is itching.

675
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:58,396
I think that means
I'm going to punch someone.

676
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:03,902
Your sister's manager
is asking for her salary.

677
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:05,403
You shouldn't dismiss her request.

678
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:07,572
I've already answered
all of your questions.

679
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:08,740
What do you want now?

680
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:11,117
I'm not here for you.

681
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:12,827
I'm here to talk to her today.

682
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:16,039
We talked on the phone earlier.
Do you have time to talk?

683
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:18,500
Let's go.

684
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:23,546
Seriously.

685
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:25,632
I'll keep my questions brief.

686
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:27,967
Just answer them honestly.
No need to be nervous.

687
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:29,844
All right.

688
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:32,555
Here you go.

689
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,267
But that's mine.

690
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,272
Please, have some.

691
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:44,901
Did you know anything
about Cha Eun-sae's personal life?

692
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:47,987
Like maybe,
was she romantically involved with anyone?

693
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:50,907
I think she was.

694
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,203
Whenever she got a call or a text,
she would delete it right away.

695
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:59,040
Eun-sae's brother
used to go through her phone.

696
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:01,167
Really?

697
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:04,087
Who were the men she was close to?
Give us some names.

698
00:57:10,426 --> 00:57:11,386
I'm not sure.

699
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:15,431
She rarely talked about herself.
She kept a lot of secrets.

700
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:20,603
Cha Geum-sae was her manager
before you, right?

701
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:21,688
Yes.

702
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:26,109
But he was always busy gambling,
so she did most of the work herself.

703
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:28,361
You said he often went through her phone.

704
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,530
I guess he liked to meddle
in everything she did.

705
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:34,951
Don't even get me started.

706
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:37,620
He extorted money from her
and harassed her all the time.

707
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:39,330
It only got worse when he was drunk.

708
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:43,001
Two weeks ago,
we almost had to call the police.

709
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:44,169
Hey.

710
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:48,047
Hey! You.

711
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:50,717
Do I look like a beggar to you?

712
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:54,596
You know what happens when I lose it.

713
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:57,682
You little…

714
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:01,478
I'll kill you and kill myself too,
you little witch.

715
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:02,562
A knife?

716
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:05,273
Then he's the killer for sure.

717
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:10,945
When I think about Eun-sae,
I feel so bad for her.

718
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:13,114
Her brother was the only family she had,

719
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:15,283
but he harassed her
until the day she died.

720
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:26,085
The investigation is going well
for both cases.

721
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:28,296
Don't worry about us.
Worry about your team first.

722
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:29,380
All right.

723
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:32,217
You're bluffing again.
Nothing's going well.

724
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,259
Why, you…

725
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,511
What? No, it's nothing.

726
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:35,929
Okay, talk soon.

727
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:39,182
You little troublemaker.

728
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,352
What were you going on about?

729
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:46,189
The fingerprints we lifted from the scene
all belong to Cha Eun-sae and her brother.

730
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:47,440
What?

731
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:50,360
What about the witnesses' fingerprints
on the doorknobs?

732
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:53,238
The workers were all wearing gloves.

733
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:57,909
I can't believe they only have cameras at
the main entrance and in the parking lot.

734
00:58:57,992 --> 00:59:00,578
That's why it's the perfect spot
for a premeditated murder.

735
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:02,330
Find anything
among the victim's belongings?

736
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:04,832
You said she was holding a necklace.

737
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:06,417
We couldn't find her phone.

738
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:07,919
Detective Oh is getting her call log.

739
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:09,295
My goodness.

740
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:13,383
You interviewed Cha Geum-sae.
What do you think? Did he do it?

741
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:16,594
There's something fishy about him.
He threatened her recently.

742
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:20,932
He was in the building the day she died,
and couldn't give an alibi right away.

743
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:23,768
You should keep digging.

744
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:25,520
Yes, I should.

745
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:30,775
Is it okay with you
that you have to see Seo Jeong-won?

746
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:34,320
I can't avoid seeing her.
She's on TV all the time.

747
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:37,156
Come on,
you know that's not what I'm asking.

748
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:39,450
Whether I see her or not,

749
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:42,328
I'll always think of Detective Cha
for as long as I'm a cop.

750
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:48,626
Hey, Tae-heon!

751
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,130
-What is it?
-Come with me.

752
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:57,385
What is it?
Why are you being all secretive?

753
00:59:57,468 --> 00:59:59,929
Listen, don't get too excited.

754
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:01,598
You've got something exciting?

755
01:00:02,473 --> 01:00:04,392
I went through Cha Eun-sae's call log.

756
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:06,561
The number she called the most was…

757
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:09,480
-Seol Woo-jae?
-Yes.

758
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:12,567
It's registered to a publishing company
owned by Ms. Seo's husband.

759
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:15,111
They talked almost every day.

760
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:19,324
I think Cha Eun-sae
was seeing Seol Woo-jae.

761
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:21,409
What a jerk.

762
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:23,703
I was wondering why you brought it up
with Cha Geum-sae.

763
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:24,787
How did you figure it out?

764
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:27,040
Contact the service provider,

765
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:30,627
find out if this number's GPS can be
traced to Leaders Palace on October 6th.

766
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:37,383
WRITER YANG AE-NA

767
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:39,260
Yes, Ms. Yang.

768
01:00:53,274 --> 01:00:55,360
Hey, get up.

769
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:56,778
Hey.

770
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:58,279
What are you doing?

771
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:01,616
Who are you people? How did you get in?

772
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:03,743
I'm Seo Jeong-won from Nothing Uncovered.

773
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:05,411
You just hit your wife, didn't you?

774
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:08,539
Who are you to barge into my house?!

775
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:09,540
Get out.

776
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:10,750
I said, get out!

777
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:12,794
Damn it!

778
01:01:13,294 --> 01:01:14,879
Show it to the camera.

779
01:01:14,962 --> 01:01:17,340
Did you hit her
to get her to sign a loan application?

780
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:19,842
You jerk, turn off the camera!
Turn it off!

781
01:01:20,426 --> 01:01:22,553
You vowed to love her forever
when you married her.

782
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:25,723
How could you deceive your wife
and betray her?

783
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:27,350
-You little…
-Jeong-won!

784
01:01:27,433 --> 01:01:28,935
-You!
-Please calm down!

785
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:31,354
-Damn you.
-Please…

786
01:01:32,146 --> 01:01:33,731
-Hey.
-Damn it!

787
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:35,692
You must have a death wish.

788
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:36,776
Let go.

789
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:39,737
I said, let go!

790
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:42,448
You…

791
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:43,366
Damn you.

792
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:45,785
You won't let go? No? Take this!

793
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:47,912
Let go of me!

794
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:03,386
Stop. I'm okay.

795
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:14,856
You're a wanted criminal.

796
01:02:14,939 --> 01:02:17,900
You're under arrest.
You have the right to an attorney.

797
01:02:27,368 --> 01:02:29,704
-Please escort the assailant upstairs.
-Okay.

798
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:51,934
-Take her inside.
-Okay.

799
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:53,144
-Take good care of her.
-I will.

800
01:02:53,227 --> 01:02:54,312
This way, please.

801
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:12,830
What are you doing?

802
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:15,833
You know how many wanted criminals
carry deadly weapons?

803
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:17,877
What in the world were you thinking?

804
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:20,922
Why are you getting so worked up over it?

805
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:28,679
Because…

806
01:03:29,847 --> 01:03:31,849
My partner died
because he let his guard down.

807
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:36,854
Don't tell me you don't remember

808
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:39,524
Detective Cha.

809
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:43,069
How could I forget him?

810
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:46,364
I wanted to cover the case on my show.

811
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:01,546
What is it?

812
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:04,131
Okay.

813
01:04:47,091 --> 01:04:50,011
I've sent you the GPS records
from the Leaders Palace visitors.

814
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:19,874
The day Cha Eun-sae died

815
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:23,085
Woo-jae went to that building too.

816
01:05:25,504 --> 01:05:27,882
Jeong-won, I'm home.

817
01:05:33,804 --> 01:05:35,473
What happened here?

818
01:05:35,556 --> 01:05:37,350
-I was looking for something.
-What?

819
01:05:39,393 --> 01:05:40,561
That necklace?

820
01:05:42,855 --> 01:05:43,856
My God.

821
01:05:46,233 --> 01:05:47,068
Seol Woo-jae,

822
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:52,406
why did you go to Leaders Palace
the day Cha Eun-sae died?

823
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:14,512
Who is it?

824
01:06:14,595 --> 01:06:16,138
I'm a detective
from Gangha Police Station.

825
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:40,246
I'm from Gangha Police Station's
Violent Crimes Unit One.

826
01:06:41,038 --> 01:06:42,331
Lieutenant Kim Tae-heon.

827
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:46,752
-Mr. Seol Woo-jae, right?
-Yes, what is this about?

828
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:50,506
-Why are you--
-This is about Cha Eun-sae's case.

829
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:54,301
I need you to come with me.

830
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:41,348
That day, I wanted to kill Cha Eun-sae.

831
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:42,767
All of this feels like a nightmare.

832
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:45,144
I'm only going to ask once. Did you do it?

833
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:46,312
I didn't do it!

834
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:50,816
The police must be counting on the
likelihood that her lover is the killer.

835
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,568
Cha Eun-sae was your lover, wasn't she?

836
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:53,861
I'm a victim too.

837
01:07:53,944 --> 01:07:56,363
As you know,
having a sponsor is a personal matter.

838
01:07:56,447 --> 01:07:58,282
Cha Eun-sae had a sponsor, didn't she?

839
01:07:58,365 --> 01:07:59,241
Mo Hyeong-taek?

840
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:01,327
Well, if you're cleared,
there's no problem.

841
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:03,329
She already knew she was going to die.

842
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:05,623
The two of you look lovely together.

843
01:08:05,706 --> 01:08:07,291
It seems a little suspicious.

844
01:08:07,374 --> 01:08:11,212
Maybe this is a set-up,
and someone is after us. Don't you agree?

845
01:08:11,295 --> 01:08:13,631
To me, you're the prime suspect now.
