1
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:49,382
ALL LOCATIONS, PEOPLE, ORGANIZATIONS,
INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,970
Hey, why did you tell me to record
Reporter Seo's whereabouts?

3
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,263
You know why.

4
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,432
Keep an eye on her, see if she meets

5
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:59,684
the woman in the wine-colored coat
while I'm in Mueon.

6
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,019
Just in case something happens.

7
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:03,396
Looks like you should
keep an eye on her yourself.

8
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,981
She's in Mueon now too.

9
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:05,982
MUEON

10
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,859
-What?
-If that woman

11
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,944
really is the culprit, it'll be dangerous.

12
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,905
Isn't that why you told me
to keep tabs on her?

13
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:14,783
Maybe she's going to Mueon
to meet that woman.

14
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:17,452
Give me real-time updates
on exactly where in Mueon she is.

15
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,861
Who are you?

16
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,364
Who are you? What do you want?

17
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,216
What are you doing here?

18
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,969
That's my question, exactly.
Why are you here?

19
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,973
What are you after?
Why did you come all the way to Mueon?

20
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,266
What about you?

21
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:24,185
Don't tell me you came all the way here
to tail me.

22
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,233
This is your warning.

23
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:33,069
Don't tail me again
unless you're going to arrest me.

24
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,919
Did you know that someone
was secretly questioned

25
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,172
as a witness in relation
to the Cha Eun-sae case?

26
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,340
Who's this person?

27
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,508
The thing is,

28
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:59,053
rumor has it that it was
your husband's friend from school.

29
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,138
Is that right?

30
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:04,017
I'm going to Mueon High School tomorrow.
If you find out the name, let me know.

31
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,481
Who are you? What do you want?

32
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,450
MUEON HIGH SCHOOL FESTIVAL

33
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:31,002
MUEON HIGH SCHOOL

34
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,054
Yes, Tae-heon.

35
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:43,223
While I visit Jin Myeong-suk's
ex-husband's family,

36
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,767
track where Seo Jeong-won goes
after Mueon High School.

37
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,072
VICE PRINCIPAL SON DU-IN

38
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,867
You said you were making
a promotional video

39
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,452
for the foundation yourself.

40
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,788
Yes, it's my gift to my husband
on becoming chairman.

41
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:07,956
It'll be a surprise.

42
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:09,958
Woo-jae will be so touched.

43
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,626
Here, look.

44
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,964
He looked much more handsome in person.

45
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,966
SEOL WOO-JAE

46
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,926
YOO YUN-YEONG

47
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,929
Do you know Yoo Yun-yeong?

48
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,724
I met her through my husband,
and we're quite close now.

49
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,184
Yes. I know Yun-yeong.

50
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,271
I know her well.
She was one of our best students.

51
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,605
I heard she became a doctor.

52
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,441
She and Woo-jae were close, right?

53
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,901
They were close?

54
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,362
I had no idea.

55
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,532
Well, Woo-jae was very popular.

56
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,285
He got along very well
with almost everyone at school.

57
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,538
You're here to collect
some impressive stories about him, right?

58
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,123
Wellâ€¦

59
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,875
I want the video
to showcase his history as it is,

60
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,794
so any story, even if it's not special.

61
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,216
Then, I have to tell you

62
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,512
about how he got into Hankuk University
and suddenly moved to the US.

63
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:08,349
He left in a hurry in February
and missed the graduation ceremony.

64
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,393
-He did?
-Yes.

65
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:21,029
Kim Min-cheol is the friend
who was questioned.

66
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,574
I guess it's someone I shouldn't know.

67
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,159
Like Cha Eun-sae.

68
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,785
Kim Min-cheol.

69
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,621
We went to high school together.
I lent him some money.

70
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,002
Sir, by any chance,

71
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:39,338
do you remember a student
by the name of Kim Min-cheol?

72
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:43,301
Yes, I do. He was a real troublemaker.

73
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,472
EUN-SAE'S SHOCKING AFFAIR
WITH SEOL WOO-JAE

74
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:50,349
CHA EUN-SAE WAS IN AN INAPPROPRIATE
RELATIONSHIP WITH SEOL WOO-JAE.

75
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,192
The father of Cha Eun-sae's baby

76
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:00,985
is me.

77
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,612
EUN-SAE LOVED SOMEONE ELSE.

78
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,489
THE FATHER OF CHA EUN-SAE'S BABY IS ME.

79
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:09,410
He said the girl he had a crush on
was ignoring him and hurt himself.

80
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,121
My gosh. It was really dangerous.

81
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,165
Was that girl okay? She didn't get hurt?

82
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,042
No. Thankfully, nothing serious happened.

83
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,128
Hold on. Come to think of it,

84
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,340
Woo-jae was the one
who saved Na-ri that day.

85
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,551
"Na-ri"?

86
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,638
-You just said "Na-ri," right?
-Yes.

87
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:37,355
By any chance, was this girl Na-ri?

88
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:40,316
Yes, that's right.
I guess you know Na-ri too.

89
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,653
-What's her surname?
-Lee.

90
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,323
Please excuse me for a moment.

91
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,577
Hello?

92
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,621
LEE NA-RI

93
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,793
LEE NA-RI

94
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,503
KIM MIN-CHEOL

95
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,213
SEOL WOO-JAE

96
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,631
YOO YUN-YEONG

97
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,554
I'm a fan of Woo-jae's novels too.

98
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,600
Do you know
what Lee Na-ri is up to these days?

99
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,062
Sorry? You said you knew Na-ri.

100
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,606
Don't you know what happened to her?

101
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,322
What is this?

102
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:32,201
After that incident,
we planted that tree in memory of her.

103
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,287
What incident?

104
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,581
In 2009, a fire broke out at a plant.

105
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,458
The fire killed a number of people,

106
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,751
including Na-ri.

107
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,798
Are you talking about the fire
at the Bongto plant?

108
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,175
Yes, that's right.

109
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,724
DONATED BY PRESIDENT SEOL PAN-HO
OF MUJIN CONSTRUCTION

110
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,774
CHAIRMAN SEOL WOO-JAE

111
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,617
MUJIN WELFARE FOUNDATION

112
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:21,292
-Do you have it?
-Yes.

113
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,222
A photo of your wife's necklace
found at the crime scene.

114
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,557
Cha Eun-sae had the same necklace.

115
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,185
Are you sure it was Jeong-won's?

116
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:42,855
Yes. The serial number in the sales record
is a match.

117
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,363
Do one more thing for me.

118
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:55,493
Look into Detective Kim Tae-heon.

119
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,788
Everything about him
from his family to his finances

120
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,416
and his past relationships.

121
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:09,340
GANGHA POLICE STATION
LIEUTENANT KIM TAE-HEON

122
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,134
How random.

123
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,555
Why's a detective from Seoul
asking about the past?

124
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,516
Families of the deceased
would've given you a hard time.

125
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,851
Yet you stayed here.

126
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,688
My brother set fire to the factory,
not me.

127
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,606
Your sister-in-law Jin Myeong-suk,

128
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,483
did you know she was murdered?

129
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,044
Just once, about three years ago,

130
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,673
she called late at night, very drunk.

131
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,843
She said it was true

132
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,929
that Jin-su wasn't the culprit.

133
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,308
Instead of saying,
"He wasn't the culprit,"

134
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,810
she said, "It's true he wasn't?"

135
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,565
Did Jin Myeong-suk ever give you money?

136
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:08,566
What money?

137
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:12,612
As soon as she got her monthly pay,
she made a cash withdrawal.

138
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:16,032
I wonder if you have any idea
what the money was for.

139
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,870
One thing I can say for sure
is that it wasn't for anything bad.

140
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,956
She was frustratingly kind and generous.

141
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,417
She volunteered regularly too.

142
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:35,384
I believe Park Jin-su
was in a coma for a week before he died.

143
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,346
Did Prosecutor Mo Hyeong-taek
visit during that time?

144
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,683
As if that punk would visit.

145
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,268
I went to see him.

146
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:47,146
14 YEARS AGO

147
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:52,902
They keep mentioning some valve,
and talk as if my brother set the fire.

148
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,405
He worked at the Bongto factory
for over 25 years.

149
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,700
He's not the culprit, sir.

150
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:03,996
Well,

151
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,458
Park Jin-su is a victim just like others,

152
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,959
so I'll make sure

153
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,253
he isn't treated unfairly.

154
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:13,756
Hey, you!

155
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,967
You said you'd make sure
he wasn't treated unfairly.

156
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,219
Why did you go back on it?

157
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,387
You can't act like this.

158
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,848
Why is Jin-su the arsonist?
He's a victim too!

159
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,851
He's at death's door!

160
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,938
Because he's at death's door,
even though he's a suspect,

161
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,273
he gets to rest
instead of being questioned.

162
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:33,776
"Rest"?

163
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,612
He's in a coma

164
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:38,989
and you call that "rest"?

165
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,618
How could you say that?

166
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,829
Since that day, whenever I see him on TV,

167
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,455
I curse him.

168
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,217
Hello.

169
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:02,221
I'm Detective Kim Tae-heon
from Gangha's Violent Crimes Unit.

170
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,640
-Hello.
-I heard Seo Jeong-won was here,

171
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:07,101
and she asked to speak with you.

172
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,814
CHICKEN AND WHELK

173
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,610
Address of the place Kim Tae-heon was at.

174
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,863
-Thanks.
-Enjoy yourselves.

175
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,739
-Thanks.
-Welcome.

176
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,868
Hello. I'm Seo Jeong-won, a reporter.

177
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,453
From Nothing Uncovered?

178
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,413
That's you?

179
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:30,749
A detective from Gangha Police Station
was here, wasn't he?

180
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:47,224
Tae-heon's here on Jin Myeong-suk's case,
not Cha Eun-sae's.

181
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,686
There has to be a connection
between the two.

182
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,110
"Yoo Yun-yeong."

183
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,153
YOO YUN-YEONG

184
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,280
Where did I see that name?

185
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:08,329
DIRECTOR YOO YUN-YEONG

186
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,169
YOU AND ME NEUROPSYCHIATRIC CLINIC

187
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,797
DIRECTOR YOO YUN-YEONG

188
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:21,634
This womanâ€¦

189
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,645
So she knew Seol Woo-jae personally,

190
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,481
not Seo Jeong-won?

191
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,947
-What?
-Ms. Seo scares me.

192
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,615
-How so?
-That woman,

193
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,867
she was at Park Jin-su's
sister's beer joint.

194
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,494
She knew you'd been there.

195
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:53,165
I think she knows Jin Myeong-suk's
connected to the Bongto factory fire.

196
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,875
Where is Seo Jeong-won now?

197
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:13,227
I warned you not to tail me.

198
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,728
You tailed me too.

199
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,649
How was Mueon High School?

200
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:22,069
The foundation PR video was an excuse.

201
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,154
You looked into your husband's past.

202
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,657
-Why do you care?
-I have to care.

203
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,034
Unlike how you defended him
when he had an affair,

204
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,579
you're secretly doing
a background check on him.

205
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,706
Anyone would think it's suspicious.

206
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,332
Why are you so frustrated?

207
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,209
Are you angry I looked into your partner

208
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,253
but turned a blind eye
to my husband's affair?

209
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:42,423
The case was closed when he died.
Don't jump to conclusions.

210
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,800
Will defending him

211
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,178
cancel out what he did?

212
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:53,684
Yes. On the outside,
I'm defending my cheater husband,

213
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:56,395
and in secret, I looked into his past,

214
00:14:56,478 --> 00:15:00,065
but unlike you, I don't ignore reality
and dwell in the past.

215
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,280
The woman in the wine-colored coatâ€¦

216
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,619
It's Yoo Yun-yeong, isn't it?

217
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:17,166
Seol Woo-jae's high-school friend
and Seo Jeong-won's psychiatrist.

218
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:20,711
I can't say.

219
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,923
You're always like this.

220
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:27,009
You never want to take a loss
and always want to use me.

221
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,928
You're the one who used me.

222
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,764
Did I want to know
about a wine-colored coat?

223
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,600
Why should I tell you
if I found her or not?

224
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:35,935
Are you stupid?

225
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:36,977
If we identify her,

226
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,104
-you'll be dropped as a--
-That's a joke.

227
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:43,692
Let's say you're right and Yoo Yun-yeong
is the woman in that coat.

228
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:47,446
What's weird about her entering her clinic
around the time of the murder?

229
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:52,117
If you identify her, are you sure
I'll be dropped from the suspect list?

230
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,870
No. You'll suspect me all the same.

231
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,791
I don't want to move the way you want.

232
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,584
I won't answer anything.

233
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,753
Think whatever you want.

234
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,881
You're right.

235
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,842
I have to keep suspecting you.

236
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,594
Because I think you lied.

237
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,473
The day Cha Eun-sae was killedâ€¦

238
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,810
you went to the scene, didn't you?

239
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,104
Just like when Jin Myeong-suk died.

240
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,898
I said no when you questioned me.

241
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,025
I should believe you if you say no?

242
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,695
I can't.

243
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,239
I want to believe you!

244
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,951
But I can't.

245
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,622
When did you ever believe me?

246
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,750
Believe whatever you want.

247
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,503
That's what you always did.

248
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,478
3 YEARS AGO

249
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,693
COMMISSIONER
OF THE SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE

250
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,822
REST IN PEACE
WE OFFER OUR CONDOLENCES

251
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,807
I told you to stay away.
Didn't you hear me?

252
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,809
I was close to him too.

253
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,770
You got close because of me.

254
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,105
You approached me to get to him.

255
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,940
If the officer suspected of bribery

256
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,359
were you and not him,
I'd have done the same.

257
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:55,699
Before he died, he told me
that you had deceived me.

258
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,120
That I should stop being a fool
and let you use me.

259
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,500
Say something.

260
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,002
Come on.

261
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,255
Please?

262
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,008
Why won't you say anything?

263
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:17,679
Why can't you give me an excuse
and tell me you weren't using me?

264
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:20,891
If I say so,

265
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,685
will you believe me?

266
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,275
If I tell you I didn't approach you
on purpose to investigate Detective Cha,

267
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,027
will you take my word for it?

268
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:37,825
This just shows
the extent of your trust in me.

269
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,451
Believe what you like.

270
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,870
Admit that blaming me
makes you feel better.

271
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:56,969
You're something else.

272
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,329
-Udon and a bottle of soju, please.
-Sure!

273
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,904
Another bottle of soju, please.

274
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,624
You were taken to hospital for cirrhosis.
You've had enough.

275
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,717
You said the same thing to me
both three years ago

276
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,803
and earlier today.

277
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,557
You told me to believe
whatever I wanted to believe.

278
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,144
Why do you keep saying that to me?

279
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,189
Are you implying

280
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,108
I've got the wrong idea about you?

281
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,779
Say what you want to say.

282
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:45,869
You and I

283
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,539
shouldn't have met.
That's where it went wrong.

284
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,919
There were other detectives too.
Why did it have to be you?

285
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,089
You've already seen me at my lowest.

286
00:20:57,172 --> 00:21:00,217
Do you know how awful it feels
to hit rock bottom with you watching?

287
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:31,099
MUEON BEACH
MUEON STALL STREET

288
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:37,064
I'm in a worse place than you are.

289
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,527
I'd rather see you
living a luxurious life without me.

290
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:46,406
Seeing that miserable look on your face

291
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:49,826
is annoying.

292
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:53,330
It upsets me.

293
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,628
Meeting you againâ€¦

294
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:04,382
I know.

295
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:06,510
You're angry.

296
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:09,888
I'm angryâ€¦

297
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:16,895
and sad.

298
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:22,901
Andâ€¦

299
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:48,844
Is he all right?

300
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,721
-Could you give us another room?
-Sure. This way.

301
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,187
Gosh.

302
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,494
Just like you saidâ€¦

303
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:22,127
I don't think you can kill someone
in the same way

304
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:27,132
your father was murdered.

305
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:38,977
MY HUSBAND

306
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,353
Soâ€¦

307
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,650
help me believe you.

308
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:49,654
Hello.

309
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:55,285
Hello.

310
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:09,424
Sorry. I tapped the wrong button
and hung up.

311
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,134
I see.

312
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,304
I heard a man's voice just now.

313
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:16,973
Someone was walking by.

314
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:20,227
Where are you?
Aren't you at your accommodation?

315
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,729
I just arrived. Why did you call me?

316
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:25,607
I was wondering
when you'd arrive tomorrow.

317
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:27,609
I won't be too late.

318
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:31,071
Okay. Call me when you leave.

319
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,074
Sleep tight.

320
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,112
Who is it?

321
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,034
Thanks for inviting me.

322
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,206
Gosh.

323
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:28,586
-What are you doing here?
-I'm visiting you.

324
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:32,132
Your wife wanted to invite me
to your house too.

325
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,218
Ms. Seo, I'm here!

326
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:38,138
Hey, Jeong-won went on a business trip.

327
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:39,306
Get out.

328
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,599
I know she went on a business trip.

329
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:43,226
That's why I'm here.

330
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,063
Will you keep acting impulsively?

331
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,818
-Are you trying to drive me crazy?
-Come on, this is nothing.

332
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:56,239
What if I were to leak the photo
of her shirt, stained with blood?

333
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:01,202
There's a photo?

334
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:03,872
Let me see it.

335
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,211
You two don't sleep
in the same bed, right?

336
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:13,590
-Do you sleep in separate rooms?
-Hey.

337
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:15,884
Hey!

338
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:18,678
Hey, open the door.

339
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:03,807
Get up.

340
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,935
Get up!

341
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,314
Youâ€¦

342
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:15,652
-You'd better not do this again.
-Why do you think I do stuff like this?

343
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:18,571
You only look at me
when I bother you like this.

344
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,117
Yun-yeongâ€¦

345
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,162
I consider you a good friend.

346
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,333
To me,

347
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,836
you're a jerk I want to kill.

348
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,631
When you love someone to death,

349
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,676
you can actually kill a person,
whoever it may be.

350
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,262
That's why I killed Cha Eun-sae.

351
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:47,976
What's with that reaction?

352
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,395
I can't even crack a joke with you?

353
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,025
How could you say such a thing?

354
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:00,613
You look like you're about to
hit me with that.

355
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:02,449
Why?

356
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:05,076
Wasn't she just a fleeting distraction?

357
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,039
This is why

358
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,709
your wife wants to throw you
into the fiery pit.

359
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:13,877
If anyone

360
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:19,215
threatens my wife, I will throw them
into the fiery pit myself.

361
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,468
You're only making me not want to give up.

362
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:23,052
Actually, no.

363
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:28,433
This means you're bothered by me,
which is a good thing. Right?

364
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,273
I'll be leaving, then.

365
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:38,818
Right.

366
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:42,322
I almost forgot to give you
your surprise gift.

367
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:47,744
You'll like it.

368
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,960
Hop in. You're not fully sober
so you can't drive.

369
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,670
You don't know where I'm headedâ€¦

370
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:31,848
Enjoy.

371
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,437
You need to eat something first anyway.

372
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:49,449
-Is it too spicy? Do you like it?
-Yes.

373
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:55,955
Since I found out
my husband cheated on me,

374
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,750
I haven't been able to taste anything.

375
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:08,176
That woman in the wine-colored coat,
it was Yoo Yun-yeong.

376
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,846
I saw her at the kick-off ceremony.

377
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:16,017
I bet you invited her on purpose,
to see how your husband would react.

378
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:17,685
The bigger goal

379
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:22,231
was to buy enough time to copy
the video of Cha Eun-sae's session.

380
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:25,902
Cha Eun-sae was her client too?

381
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,571
I watched the video

382
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:30,615
of Cha Eun-sae's last session
before she died.

383
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:32,742
In the video,
a girl named Na-ri is mentioned.

384
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:33,826
Na-ri?

385
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,204
I came here to find out who she was.

386
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,288
Wait.

387
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,419
Who is Lee Na-ri?

388
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:46,506
One of the people who died in the fire
at the Bongto plant.

389
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,343
So every person
we tried to track down in Mueon

390
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:53,763
died in that fire?

391
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:04,524
Mo's housekeeper who died
is Park Jin-su's ex-wife?

392
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:08,194
Detective, weren't you the one
who handed him over to the prosecution?

393
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:11,030
Back then, Prosecutor Mo hounded me
into handing over the case

394
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,740
with the decision to indict him.

395
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,248
What is this?

396
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,083
That.

397
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:25,086
It was one of the victim's belongings
found at the scene.

398
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:30,049
-The fire broke out at 9:00.
-Correct.

399
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,301
Do you still have this stored as evidence?

400
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,430
EVIDENCE, MUEON POLICE

401
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,764
It's here.

402
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:50,778
Was there no battery in this watch?

403
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:52,780
Was there no battery?

404
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:56,242
Right. We returned it
to the victim's family,

405
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:58,870
but they refused to accept it
and told us to reinvestigate.

406
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,705
Reinvestigate what?

407
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:04,083
They said it was odd that the strap
was broken and there was no battery.

408
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:07,086
They were adamant
that someone had hurt the victim.

409
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,516
Who was this victim?

410
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,019
Does the family still live in Mueon?

411
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:26,230
No, the whole family
moved to a different country.

412
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,690
Why do you ask?

413
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,150
By any chance,

414
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,486
is Lee Na-ri this victim
you're speaking of?

415
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,946
She was in her third year
at Mueon High School.

416
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,698
What? How did you know?

417
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:44,957
MEETING ROOM

418
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,335
There were pictures of several items
found at the scene.

419
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:50,338
Why did that watch catch your attention,
of all things?

420
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:53,299
The watch had stopped

421
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:56,344
at the time of the incident.
What's up with that?

422
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,597
There were a number of victims.

423
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,558
Why Lee Na-ri's watch?

424
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:05,603
I want to ask the same question.
Why did it have to be Lee Na-ri?

425
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,605
Did the culprit start the fire
to kill her?

426
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,148
What do you mean?

427
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,901
Does the watch have something to do
with the incident itself?

428
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,071
I guess it does.

429
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,616
How did you know that
by just looking at that watch?

430
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:21,077
There was a stopped clock

431
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,578
at the other scene.

432
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:25,581
Cha Eun-sae's office?

433
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,625
I wouldn't say this
if I only saw it twice.

434
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:30,002
You saw it at the scene
of Jin Myeong-suk's murder too?

435
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:32,880
In other words,
are you saying the same signature

436
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,007
was found at the scenes
of the three cases?

437
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,384
So they were all done

438
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,344
by the same person?

439
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:44,892
My necklace that was found
at Cha Eun-sae's murder scene,

440
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,436
it would've been easier for Yoo Yun-yeong

441
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,856
to get her hands on it
than for Mo Hyeong-taek.

442
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:52,108
It's possible my husband gave it to her.

443
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:56,320
What if it's untrue that she has
no connection to Jin Myeong-suk?

444
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,364
What if we simply haven't found it yet?

445
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,099
Are we being tailed?

446
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,451
Stay in the car.

447
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:39,590
Are you okay?

448
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:42,677
Of course, I'm not.
Someone tailed a detective.

449
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:46,889
And in Mueon of all places.

450
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,357
I apologize.

451
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:58,901
I was extra cautious butâ€¦

452
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,990
ASSEMBLYMAN MO HYEONG-TAEK

453
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,331
GANGHA POLICE STATION CHIEF HONG

454
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,337
Hello, Chief Hong.

455
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,464
It's me.

456
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:23,634
I almost forgot what you look like.

457
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,263
Drop me off here.

458
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,766
You have a suitcase. I'll take you home.

459
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,602
I don't want to give the wrong impression.

460
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,113
Bye.

461
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,113
SEOL WOO-JAE

462
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,532
WITH MY JEONG-WON

463
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,495
HONEYMOON

464
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:36,374
Dear Nothing Uncovered viewers,

465
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:39,251
let me introduce my sweetheart,
Seol Woo-jae!

466
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,505
Hello.

467
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:48,803
Do you know how angry my fans were
after I announced we'd marry?

468
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,347
I promise to uncover Seol Woo-jae for you.

469
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,057
Here you go.

470
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:57,436
Here's some extra information.

471
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,772
This place is where
Jeong-won and I first met.

472
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,607
-That's right.
-Do you feel bad?

473
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:05,027
Here's more. Last night, we spent

474
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,695
-a passionate--
-Are you mad?

475
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:08,697
Are you happy now?

476
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,575
-Don't!
-Listen up!

477
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,702
Seo Jeong-won belongs to Woo-jae now!

478
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:16,288
-I love you, Jeong-won!
-I love you!

479
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:19,417
-I love you as much as the ocean's wide!
-I love you too!

480
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:24,547
It's beautiful out here.

481
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:35,141
I didn't hear you come in.

482
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:37,726
Are you tired?

483
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,689
Where did you go on the trip?

484
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:44,775
Did you drive?

485
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,198
Did you have dinner?

486
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,498
YOO YUN-YEONG

487
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:00,708
KIM MIN-CHEOL

488
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:03,586
LEE NA-RI

489
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,383
You should knock.

490
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:14,513
We're the only ones who knock
when we're living together.

491
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,517
Is it that hard to answer?

492
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:21,896
This is torture, not a chance.

493
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,899
Don't you see I'm flailing
because I'm glad for a chance

494
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,400
and trying to win you back?

495
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,320
How long will you ignore me
after giving me hope?

496
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:31,155
You ignored me first.

497
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:32,406
Cha Eun-sae andâ€¦

498
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,033
And what?

499
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:42,082
I know

500
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,711
you put a GPS tracker on my car.

501
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:50,925
Jeong-wonâ€¦

502
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,970
if you'll give me a chance,
make it a real one.

503
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:59,225
I regret saying I'd give you a chance.

504
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:05,064
I can't stand seeing you try so hard,
and seeing you watch old clips.

505
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:07,608
Everything you do annoys me,
and I hate it.

506
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,115
Do you feel better now?

507
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,036
Thanks for being honest.

508
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:25,960
We live together
and see each other every day.

509
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:30,756
And I still miss you.

510
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:33,968
I wondered why that was.

511
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,595
I don't remember when you last smiled.

512
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,347
That's why I watched the clip.

513
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:43,102
Even if I annoy you and you hate it,

514
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,938
I'll keep trying and flailing.

515
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,411
I won't give up on you.

516
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,125
I can't do that.

517
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,276
-Hi.
-You were right.

518
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:34,612
The victims of the Bongto fire

519
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:37,323
received a donation
in Jin's name every month.

520
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:39,074
It's the amount she withdrew.

521
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,201
That's one mystery solved.

522
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,954
But another one popped up.

523
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:46,915
-What's that?
-The donations were delivered in cash

524
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,834
by a man in his 20s or 30s.

525
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,963
That means someone
was close to Jin Myeong-suk.

526
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,717
-The CCTV footage is gone?
-Yes, two months ago.

527
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,887
Shall I get a worker who saw him
help draw a composite?

528
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,221
Yes, do that.

529
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,110
SECRETARY GONG

530
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:19,365
-Hello.
-Detective Kim Tae-heon.

531
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,660
He went to Mueon two days ago
and returned today.

532
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,080
Did he?

533
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:27,915
Thanks.

534
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:34,880
Soâ€¦

535
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:38,133
make me believe you.

536
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,396
My gosh.

537
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:02,825
You're so desperate to win.

538
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,952
That means it's not a simple bet.

539
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,871
You get it because it's a trick
you used as a prosecutor.

540
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:11,166
Back then, you made me do a lot of things.

541
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:15,754
Why bring up the past?

542
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:19,591
The tables turned long ago,
and now you're way above me.

543
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:23,011
I couldn't remain a politician
without your help.

544
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:27,891
Our circumstances changed
because times have changed.

545
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:33,564
Yes. What do you want done now?

546
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:37,109
I'll tell you when I'm done sketching.

547

ZEUS

549
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,954
You were sleeping uncomfortably,

550
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:14,748
so I was wondering
if I should wake you up.

551
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:18,961
I need to talk to my source.

552
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:21,213
Okay. I'll prepare breakfast.

553
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:42,484
Jeong-won

554
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:44,486
was in Mueon yesterday.

555
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:48,574
You must find out why she went there, Dad.

556
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:02,170
You must have heard some bad news
this early in the morning.

557
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:09,177
Yoo Yun-yeong is the director
of You & me Neuropsychiatric Clinic.

558
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:10,387
Can you look into her?

559
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:13,599
You're basically asking me
to find dirt on her, right?

560
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:27,112

561
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:58,101
Sorry.

562
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,312
I was on the phone with my dad.

563
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:04,316
I didn't get to ask you yesterday,
what happened to your hand?

564
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,530
I broke a cup and ended up with a cut.

565
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,038
It was sneaky and petty of me.

566
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,707
I won't do this sort of thing ever again.

567
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:26,380
I went to Mueon on my business trip.

568
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:29,841
I see.

569
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:32,302
For what?

570
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:34,346
I publicly announced that

571
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:38,016
I would expose Cha Eun-sae's killer
on my show after a month.

572
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,185
I went to investigate.

573
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,271
I obtained a lot of useful information.

574
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:44,981
Is that so?

575
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:48,318
Can I ask what kind of information
you found?

576
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:52,072
It's completely confidential.

577
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:55,909
You'll find out soon enough.

578
00:49:58,704 --> 00:49:59,913
Did you go

579
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:02,457
on a business trip alone?

580
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:04,835
Yes.

581
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,634
LOCATION:
CHEMICAL PLANT IN MUEON CITY

582
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:18,640
You were right.
This is the killer's signature.

583
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:25,814
Butâ€¦ why a stopped clock?

584
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:28,859
The killer stopped it
at the estimated time of the murder.

585
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:30,986
So it must be like a trophy of victory.

586
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:34,781
The killer must have been euphoric
after taking the victim's life.

587
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:37,576
In a way, that makes the killer
an even bigger pervert.

588
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:42,205
By the way, the culprit must have no idea
that we obtained this crucial lead. Right?

589
00:50:48,044 --> 00:50:50,797
First, let's widen the search
for Jin's murder suspects.

590
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,758
Run Yoo Yun-yeong's license plate.

591
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:54,676
Check if her car was on any camera

592
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,554
in Owol-dong on the day of Jin's murder.
Okay?

593
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:04,936
The program is bound to go down anyway.

594
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,855
Do you all want to go down with her?

595
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,858
I'll let you join my program.
Just jump ship.

596
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:13,528
I have exactly two openings now.
One for a cameraman, another for a writer.

597
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:16,156
-Do you mean it?
-Let's be honest.

598
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,908
You know she won't last the year.

599
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:22,579
Does she think she's a police officer?
How is she going to catch the culprit?

600
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:24,706
Besides, how will she air this on TV?

601
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:27,876
This kind of behavior is
putting your jobs in jeopardy.

602
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:31,546
Don't go down with her and be humiliated.
Cut ties with her already.

603
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:32,839
Okay?

604
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,654
PRESCRIPTION

605
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:08,041
Are you not well?

606
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:14,548
Ae-naâ€¦

607
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:17,968
will you join Mr. No's team?

608
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:21,888
I understand.

609
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:24,391
The newbie told me everything.

610
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:29,354
Why you defended your husband
in front of the reporters.

611
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:33,400
You were so good to me.

612
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:37,153
I feel awful that I misunderstood you.

613
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:40,490
How could I leave you?

614
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:47,080
You couldn't possibly understand
what I wanted to do.

615
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:50,000
I couldn't possibly understand you.

616
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:56,548
So don't say that.

617
00:52:58,675 --> 00:52:59,759
Hold on.

618
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:01,928
MY HUSBAND

619
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:05,557
-Hey.
-You're at the TV station, right?

620
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:06,808
Yes.

621
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,560
Dad wants to have lunch with us.

622
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:12,147
I'm on my way there.
I'll call you once I arrive.

623
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:13,773
Okay.

624
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:32,667
What's going on?

625
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:35,003
Just the man I was looking for.

626
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:37,756
The top drawer was locked.

627
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,090
Could you open it?

628
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:42,719
You have to tell me
why you're searching my stuff first.

629
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:45,680
Isn't it obvious?
Someone reported you for bribery.

630
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:49,935
You know the drill. Cooperate with us
so we can get this over with.

631
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:05,784
Have you gone mad?

632
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:10,664
You were the one
who inspected Detective Cha, right?

633
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:13,959
Do you think this kind of cheap trick
can bring me down, like it did Cha?

634
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:18,505
Your boss ordered me
to inspect Detective Cha.

635
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:21,967
You shouldn't call it a cheap trick.
You're a mere subordinate.

636
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:25,512
Detective Kim.

637
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:37,440
I was the one who ordered them
to investigate Detective Cha.

638
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:40,527
It came from a trusted source.

639
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,445
The day I got the report,

640
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:45,532
Ms. Seo also heard about it,
so that says it all.

641
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,468
When did you get the report?

642
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,470
-What?
-When were you tipped off

643
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:09,347
about Detective Cha?

644
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:21,234
THE LATE SEO SANG-GYEON

645
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:35,123
I didn't know there exists a man
who looks better than me.

646
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:38,334
To be precise, you should say "existed."

647
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:41,004
He's gone now.

648
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:48,386
My name is Kim Tae-heon.

649
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:53,224
Your daughter kept hitting on me.

650
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:55,685
She won me over in the end.

651
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,982
I'm also without parents.

652
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,944
My mother was a single parent,
but she died of an illness.

653
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:08,364
You probably hoped that your daughter

654
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:10,158
would date someone

655
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:12,660
who had parents and siblings.

656
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,081
I'm sorry.

657
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:19,626
Since I'm all on my own too,

658
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:22,629
I sure know how lonely it is
to have to get through life

659
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:24,547
with no parents.

660
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:30,470
I'll make sure Jeong-won
never feels lonely.

661
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:37,560
I'll always put her before myself.

662
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:42,649
I'll be good to her.
Please watch over us, Father.

663
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,909
I guess you received a tip.

664
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:57,413
It must be something big.

665
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:02,585
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

666
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,220
She received the tip when we were dating.

667
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,597
She didn't play me.

668
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:17,267
Why didn't she say so?

669
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:47,964
371N 3386

670
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:51,176
Plate 371N 3386?

671
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:54,637
That's him.

672
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:57,307
371N 3386

673
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:25,668
Seo Jeong-won!

674
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:33,069
-Hey.
-Tae-heon, I found Yoo Yun-yeong's car

675
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:35,905
on a speed camera in Owol-dong
the day of Jin Myeong-suk's murder.

676
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,740
I'll send you the image right away.

677
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,450
OH MYEONG-SOO

678
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:45,915
33M 6859

679
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:53,673
What were you thinking,
coming to the broadcast station?

680
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:56,175
What were you thinking, ignoring my calls?

681
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:59,512
It's so hard to have a meal with you.
What are you, the President?

682
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:04,475
Do you remember the boiled pork restaurant
behind the Bongto plant?

683
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:07,353
I found a place that makes boiled pork
that tastes just like that.

684
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:10,106
How's boiled pork for lunch?
Good idea, right?

685
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:14,444
I came up with your nickname
at that restaurant.

686
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:17,697
Mr. Bribe, because there's nothing
you love more than taking bribes.

687
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:22,285
I bribed you most generously, didn't I?

688
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:29,500
What do you want?

689
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:49,312
There's only one reason
I had you join the group.

690
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:51,022
Keep an eye on those servants

691
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:53,191
so they don't waste our money
or do anything funny.

692
01:00:53,274 --> 01:00:54,525
They're all your enemies.

693
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:59,864
You belittle all the board members
and think they're our enemy.

694
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:03,534
I didn't know it went with your motto,
"Put talent first."

695
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:06,120
You have the nerve
to talk back to your father?

696
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:08,998
Why did you get anxious
because your wife went to Mueon?

697
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:18,049
He was worried you'd packed up
and left again using work as an excuse.

698
01:01:18,966 --> 01:01:20,385
You're too weak.

699
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:36,693
Hello.

700
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:39,153
-The doctor is inside, right?
-Yes.

701
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:41,948
Detective!

702
01:01:57,004 --> 01:01:58,965
How was the work trip?

703
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:00,091
Was it fruitful?

704
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:04,470
I am asking if you've figured out
who did it.

705
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:06,764
Not yet.

706
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:09,475
You said you'd reveal the real culprit
on your show.

707
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,144
Sounds like it'll take forever.

708
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,980
I'll find the culprit as soon as possible.

709
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:21,696
Detective Kim Tae-heon.

710
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:23,698
Right?

711
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:27,493
If you can't find the culpritâ€¦

712
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:29,287
create one.

713
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:07,867
I must be destroyed
to destroy you, Father.

714
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:10,203
Don't do anything to my wife.

715
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:13,456
I emailed you the information
you'd requested on Kim Tae-heon.

716
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:15,917
-Did something bad happen?
-No.

717
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,295
Someone from the security office
filed a report saying Min-cheol did it.

718
01:03:19,378 --> 01:03:21,005
Did you kill Cha Eun-sae?

719
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:23,966
No! Why would I kill Eun-sae?

720
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,092
I loved her so much!

721
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:28,805
Someone you know well has been arrested
for the murder of Cha Eun-sae.

722
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:31,015
Who? Don't tell meâ€¦

723
01:03:31,098 --> 01:03:33,351
Go home. It's an emergency,
so I have to work.

724
01:03:33,434 --> 01:03:35,186
You need to meet the detective in charge?

725
01:03:35,269 --> 01:03:37,522
You're a reporter,
but can you try to play it safe?

726
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:39,941
I helped. Why are you mad
when you should be thanking me?

727
01:03:40,024 --> 01:03:42,151
You really don't know why I'm mad at you?

728
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:43,444
What are you two doing here?

729
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:45,905
-I'm covering the investigation--
-Do you really

730
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:49,367
have to do that
at your ex-boyfriend's place?
