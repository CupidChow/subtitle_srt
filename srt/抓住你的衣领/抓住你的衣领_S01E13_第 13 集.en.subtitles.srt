1
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:47,297
ALL LOCATIONS, NAMES, EVENTS
ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,507
CHILD SAFETY GUIDELINES
WERE FOLLOWED DURING FILMING.

3
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,634
-Oh, my. It's snowing.
-My gosh.

4
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,553
DECEMBER 24, 2009

5
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,350
We can have a date in Seoul
on Christmas Eve next year.

6
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:02,020
You can drive, so please take me
for a drive that day.

7
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,398
I could've done it today.
I should've brought my dad's car.

8
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,442
You just got your license.

9
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:11,321
Today, I wanted to walk with you,
holding your hand like this.

10
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,252
The person you are trying to reach
is unavailable.

11
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,462
Please leave a message after the tone.

12
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,256
Extra charges may apply.

13
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:16,094
Na-ri, I brought my dad's car
to drive you home.

14
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:19,097
Call me when you get this message.
I'll wait in front of the plant.

15
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,374
Na-ri.

16
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,467
Na-ri!

17
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,761
Na-ri!

18
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,475
Na-ri.

19
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,520
Na-ri, why are you here?

20
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,774
Na-ri.

21
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,828
Hello, my friend is hurt.

22
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:07,705
She collapsed.

23
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,500
I don't know.

24
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,836
No, it was an accident.

25
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,800
We're near Bongto plant now.

26
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,322
INCOMING CALL
FATHER

27
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,295
I told you not to take my car
without my permission.

28
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:56,838
Where are you?

29
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,342
I'm on my way to the hospital.

30
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,970
The hospital?

31
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,471
My friend is hurt.

32
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,976
I don't think she's breathing.

33
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,520
What?

34
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,690
I hit her with the car, Father.

35
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,320
Calm down.

36
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,780
First, check if she's still alive.

37
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:28,745
Now!

38
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:47,055
She's… I think she's dead.

39
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:56,731
Come home at once.

40
00:05:57,356 --> 00:06:00,026
Both our lives are at stake here.
Do as I say!

41
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,761
Na-ri liked this song too.

42
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,105
It's the first time

43
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,984
I've mentioned Na-ri since that night.

44
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:28,156
I told Eun-sae about her,
so it's the second time.

45
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,118
Apparently, I called Na-ri's name
in my sleep.

46
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,497
The day she died,

47
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,001
Eun-sae called me.

48
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,596
You obnoxious jerk, listen up.

49
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,974
I told Seo Jeong-won everything yesterday.

50
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:58,227
All about our relationship,
and even that I'm pregnant.

51
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:05,234
Actually, I didn't tell her what you said
when you cried out in your sleep

52
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,777
a week ago.

53
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,284
I don't know what I said in my sleep,

54
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,203
but the problem was,

55
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,663
Eun-sae realized that

56
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,499
I had

57
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,293
killed Lee Na-ri.

58
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:29,467
I thought her death would bury it,
but it's about to come out again.

59
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,636
There's nothing wrong with your 911 call.

60
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:35,181
Even if they find out you made it,
we can come up with an explanation.

61
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:37,600
There's nothing more to look into,
and they can't anyway.

62
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:42,563
Neither Kim Tae-heon nor Mo Hyeong-taek
can do anything until her body's found.

63
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:46,025
Even if your worst fear comes true,
without a corpse--

64
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,653
It will end up
as an ordinary missing persons case?

65
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,322
I know it will.

66
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,866
You said that enough
to make my ears bleed.

67
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,454
I thought we had it sorted out.

68
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,706
Did you come here this late
out of anxiety?

69
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,668
I told you clearly

70
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,503
that you couldn't mess up now.

71
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:08,047
If you're so worried,
drop the Mujin resort project

72
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,049
and go abroad to study with Jeong-won.

73
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,300
I won't run away.

74
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,137
Steeling my resolve on my own
didn't seem good enough,

75
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,848
so I came to run it by you.

76
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,062
What I did wrong in the past…

77
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,482
I'll hide it even more completely.

78
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,150
Until the very end.

79
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:33,823
I can't let my child be branded
as the child of a murderer.

80
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:38,160
From now on,
I'll become more cowardly, more shameless,

81
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,913
and more dreadful, Father.

82
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,667
If I sway under the pressure,

83
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,086
help me stand my ground.

84
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:13,571
I heard you ended up in the emergency room
the day after we drank here.

85
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,657
Why didn't you tell me?

86
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:20,036
You can't drink so much
when you have liver cirrhosis.

87
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,246
I didn't tell you
because I knew you'd nag.

88
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,456
My goodness.

89
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,751
You asked me to nag
every now and then, like a parent.

90
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,629
I would've totally done something

91
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,214
if I weren't so drunk that day. Eat up.

92
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,009
The older you get,

93
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,138
the harder it becomes to live sober.

94
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,848
It takes even more effort.

95
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,353
Do you know

96
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:49,148
what I respect and admire you
the most for?

97
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,817
You never look like you're out of control.

98
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,822
Your life isn't that easy either.

99
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,369
As a widowed man
with a sibling with a rare disease.

100
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,255
Unlucky people like me manage to go on.

101
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,716
Your life is a hundred times
better than mine.

102
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,134
Why are you falling apart?

103
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:21,889
I don't know.

104
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,392
I think my life
is just as unfortunate as yours.

105
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,024
Tae-heon,

106
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,527
give up.

107
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,656
For Reporter Seo's sake
and for your own sake too.

108
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:59,677
When I found out that your father
was Reporter Seo Sang-gyeon,

109
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,096
I thought the universe brought you to me.

110
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,180
My sister

111
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,767
and your father

112
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,353
were murdered by the same person.

113
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,075
Dad,

114
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,204
who did you talk to
outside Lee Na-ri's place?

115
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,002
Did you die because of that call?

116
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,925
I'm so frustrated,
but I don't know how to find out.

117
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,137
Can you tell me in my dreams?

118
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,389
THE LATE SEO SANG-GYEON

119
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,568
I'm becoming a mother.

120
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:00,654
For my child and me,

121
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:03,782
I must find out

122
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,660
whether or not

123
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,954
Woo-jae is a murderer.

124
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:24,386
Why did Woo-jae come here that day?

125
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,729
-Can I ask you something?
-Sure.

126
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:38,609
Did something happen here on January 10?

127
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:39,735
On the tenth?

128
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:45,407
There was a concert to commemorate
the Bongto plant fire victims.

129
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,452
It happens here every year.

130
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:50,579
I see.

131
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,043
-Thank you.
-Sure.

132
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,798
-Hi, Ae-na.
-Did you read about your pregnancy?

133
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,927
Seeing how your in-laws
released the news so early,

134
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,972
it looks like they're pressuring you
to go back.

135
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,182
What will you do?

136
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,434
Let's talk about it later.

137
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,733
MUJIN GROUP HEIR SEOL
AND WIFE SEO ARE EXPECTING

138
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,168
Hi, Jeong-won.

139
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,212
Did you see the news about my pregnancy?

140
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:42,548
It's in the news?

141
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:46,093
These news articles
are not going to make me return.

142
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,513
I'm sorry. I dropped the ball.

143
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,516
As soon as I'm back in Seoul,

144
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,935
I'll have the PR team ensure
it never comes up again.

145
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,270
Where are you?

146
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:57,563
I'm in Mueon.

147
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,398
Why are you there again?

148
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,901
Well…

149
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:06,697
I'm at Mujin Development
to discuss the new resort we'll build.

150
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,199
My father will join me soon.

151
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:12,202
Make sure your father hears it,
not just the PR team.

152
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,882
He had no offspring,

153
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:29,011
so I wondered if I should adopt the nephew
who was born two years ago.

154
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,513
You can relax now.

155
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,265
Now your heir will have an heir.

156
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,392
Competitors are already worried

157
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:38,687
that our company
will soon grow much larger.

158
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,231
Why don't you look into expanding

159
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,943
the high-end residential complex
you were planning?

160
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,195
When my daughter-in-law's
heavily pregnant,

161
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,447
she would make the perfect spokesmodel.

162
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,615
Yes, sir.

163
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:54,119
I'll see if we can improve our image
and secure more funding and benefits

164
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,788
from the government.

165
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:56,997
Sounds good.

166
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,212
I know you got the reporters

167
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:07,132
to write about Jeong-won's pregnancy
and her suspected affair

168
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,425
with Kim Tae-heon.

169
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,637
Remember what I told you?

170
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:15,015
All the heinous deeds
you committed for my sake…

171
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,601
I understand them now.

172
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,813
I know the news articles
about her pregnancy

173
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,481
are just the start.

174
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:25,693
I also know you could push harder,
but you're holding back.

175
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:31,615
Father,

176
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,828
I'll go all-in with this project.

177
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,914
And the results will surpass
your expectations.

178
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,418
So I ask that you don't bother Jeong-won.

179
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,795
To tell you the truth,

180
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:47,006
I'd rather avoid doing one thing she hates

181
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,675
than try to do ten things she likes.

182
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,261
I'd appreciate it.

183
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,229
Hey, Assemblyman Mo.

184
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:05,899
Sure.

185
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,613
You can have lunch with Mr. Bae.

186
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,698
What about you?

187
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:17,828
He's getting big-headed
because he listened to the 911 call.

188
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:20,456
I have no choice.
I must put him in his place.

189
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,579
Did you already have a lunch appointment

190
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,956
and have to cancel for me?

191
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:06,877
Just like you wanted,

192
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,839
I'll raise it to Level Four
for the building use.

193
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:15,511
However, I'll need to take 49% profit
of the total investment profits.

194
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,515
If this goes south,
I might get charged with malpractice.

195
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,310
I ought to be rewarded
for the big risk I'm taking.

196
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,984
I doubt that you're in any position
to be stubborn about this.

197
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,279
Remember 2009, Christmas Eve.

198
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,156
You mean the 911 call my son made?

199
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:42,371
I saw your car in the garage that day.

200
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:45,791
The front headlight
was completely shattered, you know.

201
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,669
Who caused the accident?

202
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,379
Was it you or your son?

203
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:56,677
Do you remember Mr. Hong,
my driver at that time?

204
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:00,347
So the driver caused the accident?

205
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,559
On his way back from picking up my son,
he hit my son's friend.

206
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:04,726
Which friend?

207
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,687
Why do you want to know?

208
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,815
I get the feeling
it might be someone I know.

209
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:12,276
I ought to pay Mr. Hong a visit.

210
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,156
He died of an illness three years ago,

211
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:18,782
unfortunately.

212
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,621
My son called 911 to report the accident,

213
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,749
and the car was damaged,
so I understand your suspicion.

214
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,503
People like us have a hard time
trusting others. You know?

215
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:33,964
You're right.

216
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,093
All right. I'll take a closer look,

217
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,554
to see if you're telling the truth or not.

218
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:41,722
Go ahead.

219
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,309
I took a closer look at you too.

220
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:51,440
About the scars on your chest…

221
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,276
I heard you got treated for them
three weeks ago

222
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,277
by Dr. Han.

223
00:19:57,237 --> 00:20:00,991
Your daughter is claiming
that you're faking the whole thing.

224
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:02,910
I'm thinking about

225
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,205
paying her a visit instead of you.

226
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:08,957
Can I?

227
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,553
Thanks for the meal.

228
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,935
It doesn't matter what Soo-rin says.

229
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,480
It's nothing
compared to the evidence I have.

230
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,032
All those years ago,

231
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,827
there was blood
on the broken headlight of your car.

232
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,957
So I took a piece
of the bloodstained headlight.

233
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,754
I don't care about the identity
of Woo-jae's friend in the accident.

234
00:20:56,755 --> 00:21:00,259
But I will try to find that friend
and compare blood samples.

235
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,471
I should thank you for the meal.

236
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,595
My friend is hurt.

237
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:51,101
We're near Bongto plant now.

238
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:56,106
If Lee Na-ri was the friend
who got hurt near the plant,

239
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:00,694
Seol Woo-jae could have reported it
since he was her boyfriend then.

240
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,155
Tae-heon.

241
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:06,116
The 911 call from 2009
was made from Seol Woo-jae's phone?

242
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,868
Gosh. Seriously.

243
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:11,163
It's like you're psychic or something
when you do that.

244
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,709
In the 911 call,
he said his friend was hurt.

245
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,711
-That friend…
-It could be Lee Na-ri.

246
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:20,881
Then it means Seol Woo-jae
knew Na-ri escaped from the factory

247
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:23,342
and that she was in an accident.

248
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,343
If that's really the case,

249
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,846
it means Seol Woo-jae
deliberately stayed silent

250
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,890
while Lee's funeral was held
with the wrong body.

251
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,266
But why?

252
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:33,560
Why did he cover it up
and keep it a secret?

253
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:36,229
She wasn't just a friend.
She was his girlfriend.

254
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:40,400
What if he was the one
who caused the accident?

255
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,485
Then it makes sense.

256
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,321
So Seol Woo-jae is a murderer?

257
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:47,574
That's how he knows where her body is.
Right?

258
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:50,494
If I'm right, this is a murder case,
and the body will be the key.

259
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,537
We must find Lee's body no matter what.

260
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:57,375
If he hid the fact that he murdered
Lee Na-ri and married Seo Jeong-won…

261
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:17,015
JANUARY 10

262
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:21,645
MEMORIAL CONCERT
FOR BONGTO PLANT FIRE VICTIMS

263
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,899
NO ONE HAS TAKEN RESPONSIBILITY

264
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,707
MEMORIES, PROMISES AND THE LONGING

265
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,220
That guy.

266
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,892
What is Jeong-won's husband doing here?

267
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,322
No way.

268
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,325
It can't be.

269
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:51,878
Jeong-won, did you know?

270
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:56,883
Banana milk was my sister's favorite.

271
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,553
I'm sure your husband knew about it too.

272
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,473
He was Na-ri's first love.

273
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,442
I confess,

274
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:17,404
you remind me of my sister.

275
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:20,907
Get in the car in one minute
or there's no snack!

276
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,618
I felt comforted
every time you took care of me.

277
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:25,286
I felt like I could rely on you.

278
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:29,290
I felt as if my late sister
had come back from the dead.

279
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,500
Hey, that's cute.

280
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,012
Jeong-won,

281
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:47,267
if my hunch is right,
and my sister really is buried here…

282
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,646
and if it was your husband
who killed her and buried her,

283
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,108
I will

284
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,529
avenge her death the same way.

285
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:01,948
I'm sorry, Jeong-won.

286
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,826
I'm really sorry.

287
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:31,686
Na-ri.

288
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:35,732
Na-ri.

289
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,110
What is this?

290
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,071
What is this?

291
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,450
Na-ri!

292
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:50,330
Na-ri, I'm sorry.

293
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,717
Did you hear that just now?

294
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,429
What's happening here?

295
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:58,773
Yes, Detective Bong.

296
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,317
What?

297
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,528
I'll leave now.

298
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,101
I love you.

299
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,605
You're going to end it with him one day.

300
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,900
Our feelings for each other still remain.

301
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:48,114
I can wait for a long time.

302
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,492
I want to wait.

303
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:54,704
Can't I?

304
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,465
I told him not to contact me again.

305
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:10,136
Why am I waiting for his call,
like an idiot?

306
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,046
Do you know this guy?

307
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,514
-He was strangled?
-Yes.

308
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:12,323
The unidentified human who is buried here,
it must be Lee Na-ri, right?

309
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:15,952
Yes, I think so.

310
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:18,329
Because Lee Ba-reun was found here.

311
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:21,249
The skin on Lee Ba-reun's palms
was all peeled off.

312
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,333
He dug all this up.

313
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,094
If he dug this whole area,

314
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:36,431
it means he was sure
Lee Na-ri was buried here.

315
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:37,932
That's odd.

316
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,101
How did he know that she was buried here?

317
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,310
That I don't know.

318
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:45,064
But he died because he knew
Lee Na-ri was buried here.

319
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,775
The person who buried Lee Na-ri
probably killed him too.

320
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:49,652
That makes sense.

321
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,364
What time did the witness find him?

322
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:56,659
Around 7:00 p.m.
They said they heard someone running.

323
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,746
This isn't a hiking trail.

324
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:03,458
I'm 99% sure
it was the person who killed Lee Na-ri.

325
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,045
The culprit left him here
because they had to flee.

326
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,758
So the culprit was here

327
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:14,343
until the witness arrived.

328
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,460
-Did something happen?
-Why are you in Mueon?

329
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,045
That's what I want to ask you.

330
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,047
What happened?

331
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:52,965
What's going on?

332
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,675
-It's--
-Detective Bong.

333
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:01,390
What is it?

334
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:03,643
Why won't you tell me?

335
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,732
You're scaring me.

336
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:13,736
Is it something I can't know?

337
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:26,332
Wait.

338
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,004
Listen carefully to what I say.

339
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,592
Lee Ba-reun

340
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:40,888
is dead.

341
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,767
He was found in Mueonsan,

342
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,770
and his body was taken away.

343
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:56,904
Was it suicide?

344
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,249
I don't think you should see the body.

345
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,962
911 RESCUE TEAM

346
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,759
Don't, Jeong-won.

347
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:42,783
No.

348
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:46,662
This isn't right.

349
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,665
Ba-reun.

350
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,418
Ba-reun.

351
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:54,754
Wake up.

352
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,382
Ba-reun.

353
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,180
No. It was a gift.

354
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,808
Get in the car in one minute
or there's no snack.

355
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:15,149
I'll be in touch again, Jeong-won.

356
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:17,026
Let's have a drink.

357
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,739
Just like old times.

358
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,078
You said you'd be in touch.

359
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,455
We were going to meet up.

360
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,250
You can't end up like this too.

361
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:33,876
No.

362
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,170
Wake up.

363
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,255
Ba-reun.

364
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,257
Ba-reun!

365
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:41,634
Ba-reun!

366
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:44,720
Ba-reun!

367
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,014
Open your eyes.

368
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,391
Oh, no.

369
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,268
Ba-reun.

370
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,186
Ba-reun!

371
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,364
Ba-reun! No!

372
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,409
Please wake up.

373
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:07,994
Please!

374
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:11,789
Let's go.

375
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,916
No.

376
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,251
No!

377
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:19,839
Ba-reun.

378
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:24,885
MUEONSAN NATIONAL PARK

379
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,388
What? Lee Ba-reun was murdered?

380
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:30,683
Is that why you asked me
to track Seol Woo-jae?

381
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,101
Do you have anything?

382
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:33,769
He's in Mueon.

383
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,278
Locate his car now.

384
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:43,362
Hang on.

385
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:48,117
His car's in Mueon too.

386
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,160
Where in Mueon?

387
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,411
MUEON ROYAL HOTEL

388
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:51,704
Mueon Royal Hotel.

389
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:57,918
Seheung City got high marks
in the municipal assessment,

390
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:01,130
receiving an award
and prize money from the Minister.

391
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:04,508
The next report
comes from Mueonsan in Gangwon-do.

392
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:09,347
Female skeletal remains
and a male's body were found side by side.

393
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,807
Police are considering murder and…

394
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,726
Female skeletal remains?

395
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,984
Were female skeletal remains
found in Mueonsan too?

396
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,239
It looks like it's Lee Na-ri.

397
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,575
We don't have an ID yet.

398
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,995
The witness said

399
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:36,040
they heard footsteps
of someone running away.

400
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:39,085
I think the killer watched
Lee Ba-reun dig up the body,

401
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:41,587
and when he found it,
they killed him and fled.

402
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:44,507
The truth

403
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,510
he wanted so much was right before him.

404
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,350
Hello. Do you have an ID?

405
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:57,728
Okay.

406
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,025
The skeleton is Lee Na-ri.

407
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:06,362
I should go.

408
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:19,834
Jeong-won. What's going on?

409
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:23,754
What are you doing in Mueon?

410
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:27,258
Skeletal remains and a murdered man
were found in Mueonsan.

411
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:29,844
Did you see the news?

412
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,806
-No.
-The dead man is Lee Ba-reun.

413
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:36,058
The skeleton, it's Lee Na-ri.

414
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,227
They were siblings.

415
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:40,479
What?

416
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,398
Ba-reun, the youngest guy on my team

417
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,108
was murdered.

418
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,654
You checked into the hotel at 6:00 p.m.

419
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:49,989
Were you here all along?

420
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:51,949
Did you go out?

421
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:55,744
-What's this about?
-Tell me. Did you go out?

422
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,792
Do you think I'm the killer?

423
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,920
Can I ask the hotel
to show me the CCTV footage?

424
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:22,104
Can you find and show me the footage
from this elevator?

425
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:25,399
I can do that since he gave permission.

426
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:28,861
Your husband actually went to the bar
in the hotel lounge,

427
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:31,405
then took the elevator back up
to his room 30 minutes later.

428
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,157
We checked that a while ago.

429
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:37,786
A detective came by and asked to see it.

430
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,663
The detective confirmed

431
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,416
he didn't leave the room
after returning from the bar.

432
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:47,505
So after he came back from the lounge bar,
he didn't go out again?

433
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,131
That's right.

434
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,394
JANUARY 11
I MET JEONG-WON

435
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:03,896
JANUARY 8
JANUARY 3

436
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:08,609
What could this be?

437
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,027
This time each year,

438
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,363
there's a memorial concert
for the Bongto plant victims.

439
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:14,240
This was handed out to the public.

440
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:16,033
When was this year's concert?

441
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:17,284
JANUARY 10
MEMORIAL CONCERT

442
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,244
January 10.

443
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:21,956
That means
Lee Ba-reun was at the concert that day.

444
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,421
Woo-jae,

445
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,800
I'm going to ask you something.

446
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,426
I want you to promise me

447
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:36,220
you won't lie.

448
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,557
Promise me.

449
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:44,979
Okay.

450
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,313
Do you know

451
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:50,192
what Yoo Yun-yeong whispered to me
before she died?

452
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:53,487
She said Cha Eun-sae's killer

453
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:55,781
wasn't Mo Soo-rin.

454
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:57,992
She said it was you.

455
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,829
-What?
-Why do you think she said that?

456
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,348
The man in this video,

457
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,393
is it you?

458
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:29,898
Is it you?

459
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,068
No.

460
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:34,987
It's not.

461
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:41,118
You know

462
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:43,579
this man?

463
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:47,750
I saw him when my dad died.

464
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:50,919
My dad's killer

465
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:54,173
had a knife
with the same swirling pattern.

466
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:55,758
So you're saying--

467
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:57,259
The man in this video

468
00:43:58,218 --> 00:43:59,720
also killed my dad.

469
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:02,056
I'm certain of it.

470
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:06,101
I suspected you,
thinking that this man might be you.

471
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:10,648
On January 10, 2010,
the day my father passed away,

472
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:13,108
you were in a hospital in Seoul
getting treated.

473
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:20,199
I couldn't stop harming myself
at that time.

474
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,618
So I was in a psych ward.

475
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:26,497
They put me in there for treatments,
but I was basically locked up.

476
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,915
I can verify that for you.

477
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:37,341
MALE CORPSE AND FEMALE SKELETON
FOUND AT MUEONSAN

478
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:42,429
HOSPITAL DIRECTOR LEE SEUNG-HAN

479
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,808
Hello, sir. It's me.

480
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:48,143
How have you been?

481
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:51,063
Hey, Woo-jae. What's up at this hour?

482
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:55,359
Well, I know that it was a long time ago,
but I need to ask you something.

483
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:59,613
You know, I was admitted
to the hospital for two weeks

484
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:01,698
in early January 2010.

485
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:05,327
I was in a closed ward,
so I couldn't come out. Right?

486
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:08,872
Back then, your father was very adamant
about your treatment.

487
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:10,874
Why are you asking about that time?

488
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,710
I just needed to clarify it.

489
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:16,380
Thank you.
I'll call you again some other time.

490
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:17,506
Sure.

491
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:19,591
Jeong-won,

492
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,177
it really wasn't me.

493
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:26,181
I swear on everything I have,
as the father of our child.

494
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:38,360
Jeong-won…

495
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:43,782
I would like to go

496
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,453
to the scene with you tomorrow.

497
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:51,498
More than anyone,

498
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:53,834
I desperately hoped

499
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:56,795
you weren't the culprit.

500
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,381
You know why?

501
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:05,179
If you had killed my father,

502
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:08,015
that would be

503
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:12,311
the biggest tragedy
my child would have to face,

504
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:17,483
and that would be the worst place
all of us could even imagine

505
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,402
being in.

506
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:27,743
I am

507
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:30,162
truly relieved

508
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:33,874
that it wasn't you.

509
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,211
I'll see you tomorrow.

510
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:48,365
-Why are you coming together?
-I want to accompany her to the scene.

511
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,038
Sit in the passenger seat.

512
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:14,182
What belongings of Ba-reun
did you find at the scene?

513
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:16,101
His main phone wasn't there.

514
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:19,354
We found a burner phone, a notepad
and a wallet in his backpack,

515
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:20,731
along with a white pinwheel.

516
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:22,274
A white pinwheel?

517
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,278
A memorial concert for the plant fire
was held on January 10.

518
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:27,988
People received pinwheels there.

519
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:31,533
Woo-jae, weren't you at the event too?

520
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:34,661
Yes.

521
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,252
Were you there because of Lee Na-ri?

522
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:43,295
Yes.

523
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:45,339
Did you meet Lee Ba-reun then?

524
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:46,548
No, I didn't see him.

525
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:49,009
-Do you attend the event annually?
-No.

526
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:50,969
Then why did you attend it this year?

527
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,931
The real arsonist was arrested.

528
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:57,643
So this year,
I wanted to pay my respects properly.

529
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:19,956
MUEON RECREATIONAL FOREST

530
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:51,822
-Excuse us.
-Hello.

531
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,074
I'm with the police.

532
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:57,577
Can I take the January footage
from the security camera in the front?

533
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,037
Well…

534
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:01,248
The security system crashed
earlier this morning,

535
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:02,916
so we lost all our data.

536
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:04,626
I only have this morning's data.

537
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,628
Earlier this morning?

538
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,088
Does this happen often?

539
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,381
No, not really.

540
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:14,720
Thank you.

541
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,679
Lee Na-ri's skeleton was found here.

542
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:02,809
We believe that Lee Ba-reun
dug these two pits.

543
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,946
I've been thinking about this.

544
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:18,492
I was the one who told him
that his sister escaped from the factory.

545
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:21,203
Then he managed to find
where his sister was buried.

546
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:23,163
That doesn't make sense.

547
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,457
Other than his burner phone,

548
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:28,210
was he in contact with anyone
via call or text?

549
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:31,505
You were the last person to talk to him.

550
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:34,049
And we found nothing relevant
on his notepad.

551
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:43,099
Did you meet with Lee Na-ri
on December 24, 2009?

552
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:47,729
Mr. Seol?

553
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:53,443
-Yes?
-December 24, 2009.

554
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:56,363
Did you meet with Lee Na-ri that day?

555
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,907
You might have met her
since it was Christmas Eve.

556
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:01,618
You were her boyfriend.

557
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:03,620
I did.

558
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:06,790
When did you part ways that day?

559
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:12,295
Na-ri had to go to the plant
for her part-time job.

560
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:15,298
So it was after walking her
to the plant in the evening.

561
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,342
Was that the last time you saw her?

562
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:22,889
After saying goodbye to Lee Na-ri…

563
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:36,653
Never mind.

564
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:41,283
Let's go.

565
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:01,303
Jeong-won.

566
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:03,513
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

567
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:05,432
Be careful.

568
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:09,853
This won't do. Get on my back.

569
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:13,273
I'm okay.

570
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:18,987
What if you trip and fall?

571
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,363
You're pregnant.

572
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:27,370
Let me help you walk down.

573
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:55,857
Do you feel nauseous?

574
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:57,317
I need to use the restroom.

575
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,401
The restroom?

576
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:00,445
It's over there.

577
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:12,290
Will you go back to Seoul with her?

578
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:14,709
Yes, why?

579
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:17,003
Then I should ask you this now.

580
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,927
Hello, my friend is hurt.

581
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:26,930
No, it was an accident.

582
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:30,350
We're near Bongto plant now.

583
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:31,768
This is your voice, right?

584
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:33,478
Yes.

585
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,315
So, your friend who was hurt,

586
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,275
-was it Lee Na-ri…
-Lee Na-ri?

587
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:41,111
No.

588
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:44,990
Mr. Hong, our driver at the time,
was driving then,

589
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:47,117
and I was sitting in the passenger seat.

590
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:51,246
-We hit Min-cheol, so I called it in.
-Kim Min-cheol?

591
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:55,625
He wasn't seriously injured,
so we sorted it out amongst ourselves.

592
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:56,960
You can ask Min-cheol.

593
00:54:57,043 --> 00:55:00,005
There's no need to.
He'll say the same thing.

594
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:02,215
And so will Mr. Hong.

595
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:07,220
You knew I got the recording
of your voice from that time, right?

596
00:55:07,303 --> 00:55:09,305
So you arranged everything in advance.

597
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:12,726
You jumped to conclusions
because of that recording.

598
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:16,604
You assumed that I killed Lee Na-ri
and Lee Ba-reun as well.

599
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:20,525
Even in the Cha Eun-sae case,

600
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:22,819
you falsely accused me.

601
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:25,697
You keep making the same mistake.

602
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:29,034
I think you're making a mistake here.

603
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:34,497
I tracked down every place
Lee Ba-reun visited recently.

604
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:37,208
I believe he followed someone

605
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:41,629
after attending the memorial concert
on January 10.

606
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:43,256
That's my guess.

607
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:45,550
Considering the timeline,

608
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:48,178
if that's when he found out
his sister was buried here,

609
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:49,554
everything checks out.

610
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:52,515
Is that why you contacted
the security office

611
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:56,853
for the security footage
and all the records?

612
00:55:57,937 --> 00:55:58,980
Too bad

613
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:02,025
you weren't able to find out
if they had the records.

614
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:09,199
To tell you the truth,
I went there last night

615
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:11,576
and got everything I needed

616
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:13,787
already.

617
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:20,502
THE NIGHT BEFORE

618
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:25,131
-Hello.
-Hello, how may I help you?

619
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:26,674
I'm with the police.

620
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:31,221
That camera outside,
can I check the footage from January?

621
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:32,388
Yes, sure.

622
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:37,852
This is from January 10.

623
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,355
This is you, right?

624
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:49,948
You were caught on camera
an hour after the concert ended.

625
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:54,327
Maybe Lee Ba-reun saw you at the concert
and followed you there.

626
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:56,579
Nonsense.

627
00:56:57,413 --> 00:56:58,498
Stop, okay?

628
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:01,584
-It wasn't me.
-It wasn't you? Are you sure?

629
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:04,170
I can trace all the places
you visited that day.

630
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:06,214
-Do it.
-Okay, sure.

631
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:09,634
I'll dig until I know
whether Lee Ba-reun followed you that day.

632
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,680
If this turns out to be you,

633
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:16,850
I'll make you pay for it.

634
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:20,061
For Jeong-won's sake.

635
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:36,035
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

636
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,299
Detective Kim,
I have something to tell you.

637
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:54,846
My dad was murdered

638
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:57,432
after threatening the person
who killed Lee Na-ri.

639
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:00,393
And that murderer killed Cha Eun-sae too.

640
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:02,937
What did you say?

641
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:14,073
This is…

642
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,366
Yoo Yun-yeong left this.

643
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,327
It's spy cam footage
from the day Cha died.

644
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:18,912
The man who killed Cha Eun-sae

645
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:22,582
murdered my dad too.

646
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,501
How can you be so sure?

647
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:27,795
The day my dad was murdered,
I saw it with my own two eyes.

648
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:32,926
The black clothes, the black cap
and even the knife is identical.

649
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,892
YEAR 2008

650
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:43,228
KIM TAE-HEON

651
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:08,753
What's that?

652
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,968
-Let go!
-What if I refuse?

653
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:16,052
Darn you.

654
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:18,888
Who are you, mister?

655
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:23,643
-Are you a thug?
-I'm a cop, you brat.

656
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:26,271
A cop?

657
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:32,068
Before Yoo Yun-yeong died,
she told me that

658
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:35,238
Woo-jae was the one
who killed Cha Eun-sae.

659
00:59:37,031 --> 00:59:40,493
I had to check that it wasn't him,
so I couldn't turn it in sooner.

660
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:44,247
I believe this man
killed Lee Na-ri, my dad

661
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:46,666
and Ba-reun too.

662
01:00:58,404 --> 01:01:01,199
Who is this person?
I will find out, no matter what.

663
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:03,242
Will you find the killer yourself?

664
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:04,911
Lee Na-ri's autopsy report is out.

665
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:06,621
Seol Woo-jae hit her with the car.

666
01:01:06,704 --> 01:01:07,664
So it's a hit-and-run?

667
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:10,333
Did you know Mr. Gong
killed Jeong-won's father too?

668
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:11,876
You didn't order that, did you?

669
01:01:11,959 --> 01:01:15,296
You've never once let me down.
Have your skills gotten rusty?

670
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:18,424
If Seol Woo-jae was the driver,
and if that man buried her…

671
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:22,637
My dad visited Mueon in 2009
saying he was working on a report.

672
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,472
Do you know what he was working on?

673
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:26,307
I should have never met you.

674
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:28,309
I should have never loved you.

675
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:30,353
Leave Seol Woo-jae.

676
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:33,690
I will get you out of that miserable place
as soon as I can.
