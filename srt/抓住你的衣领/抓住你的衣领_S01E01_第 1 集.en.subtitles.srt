1
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,591
ALL LOCATIONS, PEOPLE, ORGANIZATIONS, AND
INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,199
He should be here any minute now.

3
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,575
That's him. There he is.

4
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:25,168
Sir, you look like
you've lost a lot of weight.

5
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,504
You've lost your appetite
because of Assemblyman Ko.

6
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,423
-That jerk. He's so thorough.
-I just said the meeting was too long

7
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,259
because of the chatty ladies.
How exactly does that belittle women?

8
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:36,763
They have the nerve
to mess with the party leader.

9
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,891
So what do you plan to do
with Assemblyman Ko?

10
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:42,685
I called you over
so I could pick your brains, Mr. Noh.

11
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,148
Get rid of him in one fell swoop.

12
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,733
Bring it to me on paper.

13
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:51,152
I'll read it over a meal
sometime next week.

14
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,073
ASSEMBLYMAN KO'S SON GETS JOB
VIA COUNCIL CONNECTION

15
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,157
How does it look?

16
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:02,288
It should be something that prosecutors
and police can move at the same time.

17
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,333
You want something more powerful.

18
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,210
Nothing should be done sloppily.

19
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,795
You don't like a sloppy brands, do you?

20
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,588
I don't.

21
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,465
It's good to be sure.

22
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:34,529
I'm Seo Jeong-won with Nothing Uncovered,
Assemblyman Mo Hyeong-taek.

23
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:37,407
What were you discussing
with Noh Ji-ho, a KBM reporter?

24
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,743
Don't you think it's rude,
barging in on us like this?

25
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:44,038
I listened to an old recording
of you and Mr. Noh.

26
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:47,250
You two agreed to meet next week.
Am I right?

27
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,506
You typed up an article already?

28
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:57,468
Have you and Assemblyman Mo
planned to get rid of Assemblyman Ko?

29
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,137
No.

30
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:04,142
A party representative asking a reporter
to write up an article about something?

31
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:07,270
I'm giving you a chance
to explain yourself.

32
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,897
Do you have nothing to say?

33
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,066
You're saying
I asked him to write something

34
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,359
just because we met in private?

35
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:16,613
You seem desperate
to frame me for something.

36
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,074
Sounds like a conspiracy to me.

37
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,746
You met a week ago to discuss something,

38
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:27,206
and the reporter brought you
a typed-up article.

39
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,709
You're even suggesting what he should air.

40
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,544
I think that's called colluding.

41
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:36,633
You really are feisty and relentless.

42
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,803
I see why Chairman Seol worries
about his daughter-in-law.

43
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,556
That's too bad.

44
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:48,269
Once my father-in-law sees this broadcast,
he'll have to worry about his friend too.

45
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,329
A POLITICIAN AND JOURNALIST'S
DANGEROUS SYMBIOSIS

46
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,998
This ends the report
on the long-standing problem

47
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,875
of the collusion
of politics and journalism.

48
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,046
They say politicians and journalists
must always keep their distance.

49
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,841
They should never get too close,
but not drift apart either.

50
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,886
A journalist's morals
are visible in their articles,

51
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,598
and a politician's morals
are visible in their actions.

52
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,809
We must not forget that.

53
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,313
NOTHING UNCOVERED

54
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,275
Thank you. Good job, everyone.

55
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,776
-Good job.
-Well done.

56
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,820
-Great work.
-Thanks.

57
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,989
-You did well.
-Thank you.

58
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:41,990
Good job.

59
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:43,032
That came out well.

60
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,243
It was awesome.

61
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,996
-It was incredible.
-You were legendary.

62
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,999
-You were great.
-"Hello. This is the nine o'clock news."

63
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,500
"Here are the headlines."

64
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,419
"Here are the headlines…"

65
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:56,629
Let's fix this sentence here.

66
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,756
Shall we change
"in the area of" to "close to"?

67
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,050
Close to Jumyeong Station,

68
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,220
a man in his 20s
brandished a weapon at random targets.

69
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,140
You'll sit there one day. I guarantee you.

70
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,310
You sure give a lot of guarantees.

71
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,564
Come to the office.

72
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,614
Chief. In-han.

73
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,910
It's not fair.
All I did was curry favor with him.

74
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:31,581
You told me to stay close
to Assemblyman Mo

75
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,541
so I'd get something juicy.

76
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,253
You should be glad
that she blurred out your face.

77
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,839
Lie low for a while.

78
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,174
Damn it.

79
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:46,804
Hey.

80
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,390
How could you stab a colleague
in the back?

81
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:53,144
How could a reporter
end up wiping a politician's bottom?

82
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:56,522
I'll let you off the hook
for being a woman.

83
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:57,565
I let you off the hook.

84
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,067
Ever since you joined,

85
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,736
your female colleagues
have been promoted over you.

86
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,112
Seo Jeong-won!

87
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,280
Noh Ji-ho!

88
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,200
Get lost.

89
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:23,257
Let's both be honest here.

90
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,719
You knew I was considering getting
a new host for Nothing Uncovered

91
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,429
after this season, weren't you?

92
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,515
Isn't that why you went after him?

93
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,266
I went after Mo Hyeong-taek.

94
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,811
It's normal to switch things around
after three years.

95
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,270
That goes for our show too.

96
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,272
It's not our show. It's my show.

97
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:42,527
You said you'd acknowledge
that Nothing Uncovered was mine

98
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,446
if we led viewer ratings and trends
for a year.

99
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:49,575
My show's the reason that the ratings
for our nine o'clock news went up.

100
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,955
I won't lose what's mine
to Ji-ho or anyone else.

101
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:56,124
If I ever step down, it'll be voluntary.

102
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,625
My goodness.

103
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,169
Will that be when we need a new presenter
for the nine o'clock news?

104
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,629
Are you finished talking?

105
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,218
A journalist's morals
are visible in their articles,

106
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:10,721
and a politician's morals
are visible in their actions.

107
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,682
We must not forget that.

108
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,358
ASSEMBLYMAN JIN, REPORTER SIM

109
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,484
ASSEMBLYMAN KIM MING-YEOL

110
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,667
Father.

111
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:44,881
Drink this before it gets cold.

112
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:48,593
Oh, no.

113
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,219
I'm so sorry.

114
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:54,849
I told you

115
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,767
not to do anything.

116
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,909
Sir, you should
change into something else.

117
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,494
I'll wash this right away.

118
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,037
Do it tomorrow. Get out.

119
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:18,789
Yes, sir.

120
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,918
I'll be going then.

121
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:34,138
Ms. Seo had been contacting your aide,
Mr. Na, for the past month.

122
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,515
I think that's how it got out.

123
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,351
Mr. Song,

124
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:43,397
I don't think Seo Jeong-won
will be popular much longer.

125
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,530
Get over here!

126
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,535
Hey, you!

127
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:06,754
Hey!

128
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,425
Get him!

129
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:14,762
Damn it.

130
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,350
Stop!

131
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,602
Stop chasing me!

132
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,312
Give up!

133
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,481
Hey!

134
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,275
No, don't go that way.

135
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,235
Get off me!

136
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,869
This guy's going to make me work out.

137
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:55,928
Sorry.

138
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,477
Get out of here, or I'll stab her.

139
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,397
If she dies, you'll go down for it.

140
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,732
You know that, right?

141
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,569
Miss, don't worry too much.

142
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,529
I'm a detective.

143
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,573
I'm the team's ace. Don't worry.

144
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,409
Put your hands on your head
and stand by the railing.

145
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:20,786
I'll save you.
You trust the police, right?

146
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,206
You're ignoring me?
You think I won't do it?!

147
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,836
I need you to trust me,
so I can get rid of him soon.

148
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,129
Do you trust me?

149
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:34,550
Tae-heon, you're supposed to convince
the criminal, not the hostage.

150
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,725
-Shoot.
-What?

151
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:43,768
Shoot.

152
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,770
-Are you talking to me?
-Shoot above his head.

153
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,939
-Okay.
-You don't even have a gun.

154
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,692
-You're gonna die because of him.
-Now!

155
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,823
Damn you!

156
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:22,598
Come along.

157
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,023
Turn it off. I want to sleep.

158
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,359
How can I turn off something so fun?

159
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,902
Then watch it somewhere else.

160
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,570
Hey, Ace, I heard you scored.

161
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,239
I did the shooting, though.

162
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:41,367
Stop getting on my nerves.
Just go home and sleep.

163
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,827
-Gosh.
-Hello.

164
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,996
-Nothing Uncovered begins now.
-Why do you have to be so rude?

165
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,707
-An influential politician…
-Too bad I can't curse at you.

166
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,376
-Go ahead, see what I'll do.
-…and a reporter…

167
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:54,213
The politician and the reporter
are denying that they know each other.

168
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:57,299
In fact, the back-scratching alliance
of politicians and the press

169
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,884
is difficult to prove.

170
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,804
However, Nothing Uncovered
was able to expose the alliance…

171
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,974
She said she'd be the top reporter
in three years, and she kept her word.

172
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,642
-…between Assemblyman Mo…
-She's so cool!

173
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,144
…and a certain reporter with this video.

174
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:15,317
I got the money through a wire transfer.

175
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,487
But why do you still want to find out more
about Mo Hyeong-taek?

176
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,157
That was a peripheral hit,
not a direct hit.

177
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,033
Look into the stock scammer too.

178
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,494
So there are no signs
of Lee I-jin yet, right?

179
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:29,081
Come on, you know how it goes.
Do you even need to ask?

180
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,917
You know that I get insecure
when my episodes air.

181
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,128
Your episode was a hit.
Learn to enjoy the win.

182
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,963
That's how people end up ruining
their careers.

183
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,090
Are you busy these days?

184
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,842
That's a yellow card.
No questions about me.

185
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:43,179
This loner act of yours is making me
want to look into you even more.

186
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,390
You know you won't get anything
even if you try.

187
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,492
Good work today.

188
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,834
You should have waited inside.

189
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:19,256
Well, I got tired of always waiting
for my busy wife inside.

190
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,050
Well, there's some truth to it.

191
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,510
You're dissing me, aren't you?

192
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,094
You seem tired.

193
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,472
I'll give you a piggyback ride.

194
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,683
-Get up.
-You don't want a piggyback ride?

195
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,602
-Yes?
-You're embarrassing me.

196
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,066
You don't want to go?

197
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,277
I do.

198
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:43,155
It's been a while since I last saw him.
I'm excited.

199
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,699
I see.
Then can you give me a piggyback ride?

200
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:47,618
What?

201
00:13:56,877 --> 00:14:00,839
My daughter-in-law
is about to cost me a friend of 20 years.

202
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:04,176
Given the nature of the program,
I couldn't give you a heads-up.

203
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,096
There's a line you mustn't cross
to disgrace your own family.

204
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:10,933
This kind of action shows the importance
of coming from a good family.

205
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,478
I'm the one disgracing our family.

206
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,189
I'm cooped up in my room writing a novel.

207
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:21,944
If I cut ties with you,
I wouldn't come from a good family either.

208
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,322
I got a business card
from a reporter earlier.

209
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,283
Should I call and tell them the truth?

210
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,201
That you only accepted her
as your daughter-in-law

211
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:33,330
because I said I would live the rest
of my life unmarried if you didn't.

212
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:36,584
And in order to carry on the family name,
you had no choice but to comply.

213
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,672
That after having a huge fight
with your son last year,

214
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:45,092
you told the couple not to visit you
until she got pregnant.

215
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:51,390
But that you finally saw them again
after months for an interview.

216
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,435
This is all for show.

217
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:55,686
Seol Woo-jae!

218
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,275
I'm sorry, Father.

219
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:17,917
Here.

220
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:20,836
Gosh!

221
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,630
Your coat.

222
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,178
You must be tired.

223
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,060
Don't lie down here.
Get changed and get into bed.

224
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:39,188
I don't want to do anything
because someone else says so.

225
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,231
I'm exhausted.

226
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,909
I told you to let him have his way.

227
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,495
He thinks that he lost you to me.

228
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,247
I couldn't watch him
criticize you like that.

229
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:09,134
But it was wrong of me
not to listen to my wife.

230
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,429
Hold on.

231
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,062
Ta-da!

232
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,481
What's this?

233
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,235
Did you forget what today is?

234
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,822
It's not my birthday
or our wedding anniversary.

235
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:35,911
The first episode of Nothing Uncovered
aired on this day three years ago.

236
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,621
A present to celebrate
its third anniversary.

237
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,749
I had forgotten about it.

238
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,713
It looks really expensive.

239
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,047
It was slightly pricey even for me.

240
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,342
Put it on me.

241
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,222
Congratulations.

242
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,184
So what do you think?

243
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,270
You look gorgeous.

244
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:07,985
Jeong-won…

245
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,574
He's tenacious when it comes to
finding people's weaknesses.

246
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,285
But the only thing
he sees as your weakness

247
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,329
is that your parents aren't around.
You know that, right?

248
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,383
What's your weakness then?

249
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,345
My weakness?

250
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:40,976
You.

251
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,145
Gosh.

252
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:44,730
It's Seo Jeong-won.

253
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,480
NOTHING UNCOVERED

254
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,284
Good morning, Jeong-won.

255
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,786
Is it really a good morning?

256
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,833
It's the list of people
Lee I-jin targeted.

257
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,876
These VIPs received snow crabs
as a gift from him.

258
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,546
Reporters and prosecutors,
along with politicians.

259
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:53,924
It is indeed a good morning.

260
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:02,141
Our rookie got his hands on the list
of people Lee I-jin sent gifts to.

261
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:05,185
Hey, you need to share that
with all of us.

262
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,396
How come she's always the first one
to get it?

263
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,814
You and your criticism.

264
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,858
Compliment him when he does a good job.

265
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:15,028
Did Assemblyman Mo reach out to you
yesterday? What did he say?

266
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,074
The people I expose
always get in touch with me.

267
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,325
But he didn't.

268
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,451
Really?

269
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,788
Right. Here's what I heard this morning.

270
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:27,416
Mo Hyeong-taek
has been sponsoring Cha Eun-sae.

271
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:28,959
The actress, Cha Eun-sae?

272
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:32,129
Everything she says is basically a lie.
It's fake news.

273
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:35,132
Ae-na, if you keep this up,
you'll go to prison.

274
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,175
Fine, I guess I'm wrong.

275
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,845
His press conference is at 1:00 p.m.
Let's see what he says.

276
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:44,266
Regardless of my reasons,
my unsavory behavior

277
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,395
has caused great concern and worry
among the public.

278
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,147
For that, I apologize.

279
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:56,778
Even the mighty snake is bowing down
on camera after Jeong-won exposed him.

280
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,864
You need to be careful.

281
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:02,159
Mo Hyeong-taek will try
to get back at you for this.

282
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,329
I might get him again before he does that.

283
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:06,872
I'm going to the police station.

284
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,009
I found something new on Mo Hyeong-taek.

285
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,594
MUEON CITY CHEMICAL PLANT FIRE

286
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,889
BONGTO'S CHEMICAL PLANT
IN MUEON CITY, GANGWON-DO

287
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,643
CONSULTATION CENTER
FOR INVESTIGATION-RELATED COMPLAINTS

288
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,670
You're Seo Jeong-won
from Nothing Uncovered, right?

289
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:59,091
Yes. You're an actress.
Ms. Cha Eun-sae, right?

290
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,217
You know who I am?

291
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:04,596
Of course you do.
I've gotten quite popular this past year.

292
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,225
I'm a big fan of yours.

293
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,394
I never miss an episode
of Nothing Uncovered.

294
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:11,687
I watch it every Friday.

295
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,314
Thank you.

296
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,608
So what brings you here?

297
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:19,403
I filed a lawsuit against some people
who left hate comments.

298
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,697
I had to appear as the plaintiff
and answer questions.

299
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,242
Apparently a certain assemblyman
has been sponsoring me.

300
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,536
How ridiculous.

301
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:31,373
Yeah, right. Mo Hyeong-taek
has been sponsoring Cha Eun-sae.

302
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,750
I have a boyfriend, you know.

303
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,211
We've been dating for almost a year now.

304
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,629
I can't wait to marry him.

305
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,341
Oh, right.
Your husband writes novels, doesn't he?

306
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:44,678
What a coincidence.
My boyfriend is a writer too.

307
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,014
I see.

308
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:51,560
Wait, that necklace.
It's a Harry Joyce piece, isn't it?

309
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,270
It's so pretty.

310
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,564
It's a limited edition.
It must've been hard to get.

311
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,108
My husband got it for me.

312
00:21:58,191 --> 00:21:59,276
I see.

313
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,280
Ms. Seo, shall we take a picture together?

314
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,699
-Here?
-Yes. Why not?

315
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:11,872
Do you mind posing
like you're grabbing me by the collar?

316
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:15,876
But you're not guilty,
so I'll put my arm around your shoulder.

317
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:19,921
Ready?

318
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,340
One, two, three.

319
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,451
We've located Lee I-jin's burner phone.

320
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:50,869
I'll head over there now.

321
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,301
Yes.

322
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,681
See the low-rise apartment building
on your right? Take the third alley.

323
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:15,435
-Okay.
-Keep walking towards your two o'clock.

324
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:28,406
-It's a dead end.
-Really?

325
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:30,534
Hold on.

326
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:32,494
The GPS signal dropped.

327
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,830
The jerk must've turned off
the burner phone.

328
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,185
What's wrong?

329
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:36,558
Excuse me.

330
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,061
Excuse me.

331
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,948
Can you hear me?

332
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:55,243
Hey! Look at me!

333
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,218
She was already dead

334
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,471
when I got here.

335
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:08,400
The team from the NFS is on their way.

336
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,612
Ms. Seo, are you all right?

337
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:15,949
I think she needs a doctor.

338
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:18,660
She's the first witness.
She'll have to come with us.

339
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,402
I'll take your statement now.

340
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,654
Please describe the situation,
what you saw.

341
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,033
I was passing by the alleyway…

342
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:01,828
and I saw someone

343
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,747
on the balcony.

344
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,042
Blood was dripping down.

345
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:12,047
The door wasn't locked, so I went inside.

346
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,219
What were you doing there?

347
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,347
Lee I-jin…

348
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,850
I received a tip-off about his location.

349
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:26,269
I was trying to track him down.

350
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,147
It was a dead end, so I turned around

351
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,025
and happened to see her.

352
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,279
So I went inside to see if she was alive.

353
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:39,324
Did you see anyone who looked suspicious?

354
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:40,867
No.

355
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,331
Have you identified the victim?

356
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:48,583
What?

357
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:51,378
Okay.

358
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,845
Did you and the victim know each other?

359
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,391
How would I know who the victim was?

360
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,226
So you're saying
you didn't approach her intentionally?

361
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:07,477
"Intentionally"?

362
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,937
What are you talking about?

363
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:13,274
What on earth is going on?

364
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,287
Ms. Jin was murdered?

365
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:27,914
Yes, it's crazy.

366
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:32,293
Detective Kim, I'm sure you know the
victim was Assemblyman Mo's housekeeper.

367
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,295
He's the detective in charge of the case.

368
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,339
Lieutenant Kim Tae-heon.

369
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,301
It only happened a couple of hours ago.
Why are you here?

370
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,137
Why do you think? I called him.

371
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:45,056
The victim didn't turn up for work today.

372
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,558
Did she tell you why?

373
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:47,475
She left a text.

374
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,561
Said she wasn't feeling well
and needed a day off.

375
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:53,398
Ms. Seo, what were you doing
at the scene of Ms. Jin's murder?

376
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,901
Was slandering me on a TV show
not enough for you?

377
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,778
What are you cooking up this time?

378
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,905
I just happened to be walking by

379
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,950
and found her on the balcony, dead.

380
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,368
You expect me to believe that?

381
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:11,124
Ms. Seo Jeong-won,
you broke into my housekeeper's home!

382
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:16,379
You reporters suspect everyone
and everything you see and hear,

383
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,298
so please explain this
from your perspective.

384
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,474
We know nothing for certain yet,
so please calm down, both of you.

385
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:33,938
Did the victim have any family?

386
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,691
She was widowed. She lived alone.

387
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,027
Detective,

388
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,864
we have a lot to deal with at the moment
because of the TV show,

389
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,617
so we hope you won't go public
with Ms. Jin's identity for now.

390
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:53,416
Sir, we'll be in touch
after further investigation.

391
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,709
You should go home now.

392
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:55,877
All right.

393
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,004
I really hope

394
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:01,049
you catch the killer soon.

395
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,428
Sir, this way, please.

396
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:25,365
Jeong-won.

397
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,541
Aren't you going to wash up?

398
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:53,977
DEAD WOMAN FOUND AT OWOL-DONG.

399
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,520
IDENTIFIED AS
MO HYEONG-TAEK'S HOUSEKEEPER.

400
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,334
Jeong-won.

401
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:03,963
You didn't sleep at all.

402
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,799
We don't want your insomnia to come back.

403
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:08,927
I should see a therapist.

404
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,679
Okay. I'll make an appointment.

405
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:20,229
Your phone's ringing.
I can hear it vibrating.

406
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:21,981
Hang on.

407
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,359
Not mine.

408
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:26,903
Really?

409
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:28,237
You hear it too, right?

410
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:35,870
It must be our upstairs neighbor's phone.
I heard it a few days ago too.

411
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:38,998
You did?

412
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,136
DO NOT ENTER
TO BE DEMOLISHED

413
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,433
Don't you dare take a sip.

414
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,271
DO NOT ENTER - POLICE LINE
ONGOING INVESTIGATION

415
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:34,095
Jin Myeong-suk has lived alone
since her divorce in 2008.

416
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,180
She has no parents, siblings, or kids.

417
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:39,559
From the state of the place,
I'd say it was a robbery.

418
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:41,686
They were definitely looking
for something.

419
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,272
That must be the ex-husband.

420
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,232
I'll locate him as soon as we get back.

421
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:49,485
The aide said she was a widow.

422
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,487
I checked. He died in 2009.

423
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:55,324
Oh, dear. Then there's no point
in looking up the ex-husband.

424
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,004
MO HYEONG-TAEK ELECTED
TO REPRESENT GANGHA-GU

425
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:11,257
She saved articles about Mo Hyeong-taek.
You think she was a fanatic?

12 DEAD, 2 GRAVELY WOUNDED

432
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,440
-Any murder weapons?
-No.

433
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,901
Jin's phone is missing too.

434
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,374
There was blood outside too,
so it fits Ms. Seo's statement.

435
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:47,794
She was stabbed in the stomach,

436
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:50,922
and probably died
trying to flee the attacker.

437
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:58,763
Do you often suffer from insomnia?

438
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:02,058
I often stay up all night to work.

439
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:04,936
Right.

440
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,356
Even though you're a journalist,

441
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:11,943
was this your first time
seeing a dead body?

442
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,822
It wasn't my first time.

443
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:19,992
When else did you see one?
Was it to do with work?

444
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:25,832
Was it similar
to the scene from yesterday, or--

445
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,959
I have a busy day ahead.

446
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:29,752
Just write me a prescription.

447
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,889
Will this one broadcast change the world?

448
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,683
It won't.

449
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:46,269
However, until it does change,

450
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,813
I won't stop uncovering
criminal activities.

451
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:50,857
This part was so moving.

452
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,900
I've watched every episode since then.

453
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:57,321
Through your show,
you've exposed many criminals

454
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,198
and comforted the victims.

455
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:03,202
I want to help you,
the person who did what no one else could.

456
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,415
I want to help you recover quickly.

457
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,041
So please cooperate with me.

458
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:21,304
REPORTER SEO JEONG-WON
SUSPECTED OF DESTROYING MURDER SCENE

459
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,932
A woman is dead,

460
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:28,603
and the public's attention is warped.

461
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:32,398
I express my regret that Seo Jeong-won

462
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,651
reported something scandalous
and roped me into it.

463
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,155
So she walked in on us talking.

464
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:42,533
Is it right for a journalist to report
something immediately, out of desperation,

465
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,243
just to secure an exclusive?

466
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:47,997
With what intention did she visit
my housekeeper late at night?

467
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:53,044
Another reporter suggested
she contaminated the crime scene.

468
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:55,046
-I think…
-Seo Jeong-won!

469
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:56,756
What's the problem?

470
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:59,133
I don't get why you're so upset.

471
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,761
What I reported wasn't a complete lie.

472
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,848
Don't glare at me.
Say what's on your mind.

473
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:10,478
It's a shame I'm too late.
I was going to tip off my junior.

474
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,271
-You move really fast.
-Right.

475
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,607
Go on acting like you're special.

476
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:18,319
Don't read the nasty comments about you
that are under my article.

477
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:25,534
What is it?

478
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,582
People know I don't read comments,
so they're texting me instead.

479
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,043
"Do you want to write
about seeing a body?"

480
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:35,211
"She's a psycho."

481
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:37,380
"You killed her for the exclusive,
didn't you?"

482
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,298
"The murderer who messed up the scene
should go…"

483
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,300
You exposed them,

484
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:44,637
so now Mo Hyeong-taek and Noh Ji-ho
are coming for you.

485
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,181
What do you want me to do, run and hide?

486
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,687
I'm going home.

487
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,771
Bye.

488
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:07,451
Uncover your husband
before you uncover others

489
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:09,996
This is just insane.

490
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,080
What is it?

491
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:13,082
Is something wrong?

492
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:15,835
"Uncover your husband
before you uncover others."

493
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:20,548
Earlier, someone texted
calling me Mo's housekeeper's killer.

494
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:21,465
What?

495
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,051
Who was it? Give me the number.

496
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,929
They're fake numbers.
You can't reach them.

497
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:30,558
From now on, I'll get screengrabs
of the texts and report them.

498
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:31,767
You should.

499
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:36,814
I'll call Mr. Moon, the lawyer.

500
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,775
Where are we going?

501
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:43,612
THE LATE SEO SANG-GYEON

502
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,451
I thought

503
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,787
you'd miss your father even more today.

504
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:55,916
My dad

505
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:58,753
ended an article with this line:

506
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:03,549
"Ignore the truth,
and you will pay the price."

507
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,595
I'm not going to run away.

508
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,430
It's okay to run away sometimes.

509
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:11,349
You have me.

510
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,944
I'm so grateful I have you.

511
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,617
I'll always be there for you.

512
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,879
ONE MONTH LATER

513
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:04,985
Jeong-won.

514
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:07,238
Wake up.

515
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:17,498
Did you sleep well?

516
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,961
No bad dreams, I hope?

517
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:31,303
You have therapy today?

518
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:32,930
Yes.

519
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,857
How come you're not uncovering
your husband's deception?

520
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:46,735
What is it? Did something go wrong?

521
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:50,698
Remember the text I got from
a long phone number about a month ago?

522
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,116
Yes, I do.

523
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:54,326
I just got a text
from another long number.

524
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:55,911
Look.

525
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:58,664
What is this?

526
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:00,332
This is going too far.

527
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:03,836
You said you reported the text when
you filed a lawsuit against these haters.

528
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,755
I did.
But the police couldn't track them down.

529
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:11,343
Just ignore it.

530
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,972
No point wasting our energy
on these texts.

531
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:17,433
You're right.

532
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:21,604
Honey.

533
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,692
Are you hiding anything from me?

534
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,736
Are you serious?

535
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,822
Anyone would get suspicious
if they got texts like these.

536
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:32,907
I'm sure you would too.

537
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,950
No. I wouldn't.

538
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:37,703
All right then.

539
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,748
I'll ignore it like you said.

540
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:47,838
Come on, don't be mad.

541
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,758
I need to see you smile,
or I won't have a good day.

542
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:58,724
Stop it.

543
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:00,392
Stop it.

544
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:04,855
Seriously.

545
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:08,859
-Stop it.
-How about now?

546
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:11,362
-Stop being cute.
-Now?

547
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,573
I know what I want for dinner.

548
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:17,576
I'm craving that pasta you make.
Come home early tonight?

549
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,002
I dreamt about my father.

550
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,257
When he won
the Reporter of the Year award,

551
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,884
he was over the moon, like a little kid.
I remember it vividly.

552
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,183
30TH AWARD PRESENTATION
FOR THE REPORTER OF THE YEAR

553
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,143
Reporter Seo Sang-gyeon rocks!
He's the best!

554
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:44,895
I had no idea back then

555
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:48,566
that he would pass away two months later.

556
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:50,859
Your father was a reporter too.

557
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:55,990
I'm sorry for your loss.

558
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,409
He wasn't an ordinary reporter.

559
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:00,869
He was given the nickname "Scoop Hunter."

560
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:05,332
I see you followed in his footsteps
and became the best reporter.

561
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:10,087
You no longer have nightmares.
Your sleep cycle has improved too.

562
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:11,630
This is great news.

563
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,007
I have you to thank.

564
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,386
-I'll see you next time.
-Thank you.

565
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:30,232
There's something
I haven't told you, though.

566
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:01,930
Dad.

567
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,368
Dad.

568
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:24,495
Dad?

569
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,164
Dad…

570
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:47,226
Your father was murdered?

571
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:49,978
Who killed him?

572
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:56,485
I would like to know
the answer to that myself.

573
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:08,664
-Here you go.
-Okay.

574
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:11,083
Our clinic will move soon.

575
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:13,043
I'll send you the address
on the day of your appointment.

576
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,670
-Okay.
-Here you go.

577
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:16,213
Thank you.

578
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:18,006
Thank you.

579
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,384
YOU & ME
NEUROPSYCHIATRIC CLINIC

580
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:27,724
Marriage fraud?
Don't you think that lacks punch?

581
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:31,019
The husband isn't the only con artist.
His parents are wanted by the police too.

582
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:32,604
It's a family of cons.

583
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:35,482
That's not all.
Three women have married this con artist.

584
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:41,155
Try to get people's attention
with that then.

585
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:43,282
What's this?

586
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:46,160
Yeah, what is it?

587
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:48,245
What?

588
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:50,372
I'll talk to you later.

589
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,541
Damn it. Come on.

590
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:56,170
Anchorman Lee got arrested
for violating the anti-graft law.

591
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:58,547
He accepted bribes? That greedy jerk.

592
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:00,716
Gosh. After all the support I gave him?

593
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,050
I knew he would cause trouble!

594
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:05,846
He seemed so righteous.
Did he really accept such a big bribe?

595
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,264
I can't believe it.

596
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:10,559
What about the informant
on the marriage fraud scene?

597
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:11,852
The meeting's tomorrow.

598
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:16,523
This is Seo Jeong-won.

599
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,609
Hello. This is Cha Eun-sae.

600
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:20,444
Do you remember me?

601
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:22,029
We met in the restroom
at the police station.

602
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,907
Yes. How did you get my number?

603
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:26,658
I got it from my manager.

604
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:31,413
I was wondering
if you could come over to my house.

605
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:34,917
-Right now?
-I have an urgent lead to give you.

606
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:37,669
You know, this wasn't easy for me.

607
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,880
I had to muster up the courage
to call you.

608
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,716
I thought it was now or never.

609
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:44,927
I really hope you will help me.

610
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:48,055
I'll be there. Text me your address.

611
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:50,349
What is it?

612
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:52,601
Cha Eun-sae says
she has an urgent lead for me.

613
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:54,895
That was Cha Eun-sae
on the phone just now?

614
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:55,979
Are you guys close?

615
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,607
-We ran into each other about a month ago.
-Right.

616
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:00,067
She wants to meet up.

617
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,193
Right now?

618
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:04,029
I have a feeling this scoop will be big.

619
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:06,615
Let me go get it
before she gives it to someone else.

620
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:22,381
Come on in.

621
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,569
HIGH RISK
BY SEOL WOO-JAE

622
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,321
BLUE MURDERER
BY SEOL WOO-JAE

623
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:50,450
This is the same necklace
as the one you were wearing that day.

624
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:52,703
You're not wearing it today.

625
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:54,079
No, I'm not.

626
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,877
You must be a fan of my husband's novels.

627
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:04,131
I don't like his novels,
but I like Mr. Seol Woo-jae.

628
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:05,257
Thank you.

629
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:09,720
Why are you thanking me?

630
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:12,764
I just told you I love your husband.

631
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,393
-Sorry?
-I love your husband.

632
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:19,271
And your husband loves me back.

633
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:21,732
What did you say?

634
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:27,321
I told you I had a lead for you.

635
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,533
You see, we're in love.

636
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:34,369
We're in a relationship.

637
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:37,539
He bought this necklace for me too.

638
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:43,378
You're in a relationship with my husband?
Since when?

639
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:45,797
I already told you
when we met in the restroom.

640
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,966
We've been dating for almost a year now.

641
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,135
I can't wait to marry him.

642
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:52,888
Your husband writes novels, doesn't he?

643
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:56,350
What a coincidence.
My boyfriend is a writer too.

644
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,648
I gave you a hint too.

645
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:05,108
I told you to uncover your husband.

646
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:06,610
To uncover his deception.

647
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:10,030
You're the one

648
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:12,574
who sent those texts?

649
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:14,117
You pretend to be a sharp reporter,

650
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,787
but you seem to be clueless
about your husband.

651
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:21,792
I got the first text a month ago.

652
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:26,755
If you're really the one who sent it,
why not reach out to me sooner?

653
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:28,715
And why send me a second text today?

654
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:34,429
Woo-jae told me to wait.

655
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:37,307
He said he was going to divorce you
in a month.

656
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,602
So I waited for a month,
but he didn't divorce you.

657
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,272
I got impatient
and sent you that text today.

658
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:45,857
You expect me to believe this?

659
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:53,240
It's a pity you're trying to find excuses
not to believe me.

660
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:55,659
Too bad.

661
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,954
Woo-jae is the clingy one
in our relationship.

662
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:04,167
If you really are in a relationship
with my husband, show me the proof.

663
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,044
I don't want to. Why should I?

664
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:10,132
You should call him
and ask if he's cheating on you with me.

665
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:13,301
I'm pretty sure he'll deny it, though.

666
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:21,518
You said you had a lead for me
and made me come all the way out here.

667
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:23,103
Why can't you show me any proof?

668
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,896
You're all talk.

669
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,523
I've given you the lead.

670
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:28,191
It's your job to find the proof.

671
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,653
Isn't that what reporters
are supposed to do?

672
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:35,824
"Viewers of Nothing Uncovered."

673
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:40,537
"Did my husband, Seol Woo-jae,
really cheat on me with Cha Eun-sae?"

674
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,747
Is this fun for you?

675
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:47,461
I bet you want to grab me by the collar
like this right now.

676
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:50,088
Actually, no.
You want to slap me, don't you?

677
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:52,090
Go ahead, slap me.

678
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:54,593
Slap me all you want.

679
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:01,141
You're not worth my time.

680
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:05,854
Divorce him.

681
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:09,566
I'll never leave him.

682
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:13,403
Divorce him as soon as you can.
It'll be less hurtful for you that way.

683
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:20,786
Listen carefully.

684
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:23,789
It's up to me to decide
whether I'll get hurt or not.

685
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:25,665
The same goes for
whether we'll get a divorce or not.

686
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,626
Regardless of whether
you're right or wrong,

687
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:30,462
there's nothing you can do. You know why?

688
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:32,088
Because you're a nobody to me.

689
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:37,677
I knew you were a weirdo,

690
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,721
but I didn't know you were this crazy.

691
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:49,815
Wait.

692
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:54,986
I forgot I had something to give you.

693
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:57,531
Here, it's a gift.

694
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:15,966
I'm three months pregnant.

695
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:17,676
I thought you should know.

696
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,058
Why do I need to know?

697
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:29,396
First of all, you think this is going to
make me believe you're pregnant?

698
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,731
You're an actress, after all.

699
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:32,899
In fact,

700
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:36,069
this just looks like bad acting to me.

701
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:39,823
Secondly, let's say
you're actually pregnant.

702
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:43,577
It's still not proof that
my husband is the father of your child.

703
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,247
Just a month ago, rumors were rampant
that you had a sponsor.

704
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:01,970
Earlier, you provoked me to slap you.

705
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:04,848
Looks like you beat me to it.

706
00:53:53,229 --> 00:53:55,690
We know nothing other than
the time and cause of Jin's death

707
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:58,193
and the person who found her.
We need something else to go on.

708
00:53:58,276 --> 00:54:01,321
She had no family or friends, no enemies.
All we know is she worked for Mo.

709
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:03,657
Shall we call him back here
and interrogate him?

710
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,533
You punk. Have you lost your mind?!

711
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:08,870
Gosh, you can't yell
as loudly as you used to.

712
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:09,955
It makes me sad.

713
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:20,882
Why are you here at this hour?

714
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:24,678
What brings you here?

715
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:30,392
I'm here to get some information
on Lee I-jin's case.

716
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:31,351
Lee I-jin's case?

717
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:34,854
-What about it?
-I'm covering the case.

718
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:37,315
Detective Oh is gone for the day.
And I'm busy.

719
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:53,415
What's the matter with you?

720
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:54,833
My mind was elsewhere.

721
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:56,418
Come on, I'll drive you home.

722
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:58,253
That's okay.

723
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:01,339
I'm going that way too.
Just get in the car.

724
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,730
You don't look too great.

725
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:18,523
I have a headache.

726
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:27,157
HUSBAND

727
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:30,160
Wait here. I'll get you some medicine.

728
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:41,254
HUSBAND

729
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:45,550
I called you earlier. Where are you?

730
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:49,304
In front of the house. What about you?

731
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:50,430
I'm at the studio.

732
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:53,016
Looks like I have to work all night
to meet the deadline.

733
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:54,517
Don't wait up for me.

734
00:55:55,351 --> 00:55:58,188
Wait. You asked me
to make pasta for dinner.

735
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:01,066
Sorry. You must not have eaten yet.
I'll leave right now.

736
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:02,150
Don't.

737
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,194
I've eaten.

738
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:07,864
-I have to work all night too.
-Are you sure?

739
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:11,659
All right. Don't work too hard.

740
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:13,453
I love you.

741
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,289
Do you really love me?

742
00:56:16,372 --> 00:56:17,499
Of course I do.

743
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:22,003
I'll see you tomorrow.

744
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:59,124
Thank you. Thanks for the ride too.

745
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:28,319
CONGRATULATIONS ON THE 7TH ANNIVERSARY OF
THE PUBLICATION OF MY HUSBAND'S 1ST NOVEL

746
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:42,078
6F - LINSEAH WOMEN'S CLINIC

747
00:59:56,467 --> 00:59:58,469
-Babe.
-Hey, there you are.

748
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:00,972
-I'm done.
-What did the doctor say? All good?

749
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:02,432
-Yeah.
-Isn't that Seo Jeong-won?

750
01:00:02,515 --> 01:00:04,517
Yes, from Nothing Uncovered.

751
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,477
What's she doing at an ob-gyn clinic?

752
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:08,688
Honey, she's prettier in real life.

753
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:12,150
Isn't that the TV reporter, Seo Jeong-won?

754
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:13,943
From Nothing Uncovered, right?

755
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:16,904
-Why is she here?
-Is she pregnant?

756
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:37,925
WITH ME WITH YOU
MARRIAGE COUNSELING CLINIC

757
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:50,563
-Hey.
-Jeong-won, are you on your way?

758
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:52,190
Right.

759
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,901
Where's the interview, again?

760
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:57,403
Hello.

761
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:00,239
Over here.

762
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:07,205
What?

763
01:01:07,288 --> 01:01:09,832
My goodness.
Someone didn't go home last night.

764
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:11,584
You're wearing the same clothes
as yesterday.

765
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,086
Did you and your husband have a fight?

766
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:16,089
No.

767
01:01:16,714 --> 01:01:18,216
Is the informant on their way?

768
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:19,801
Well, the thing is…

769
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:23,137
They can't leave home due to
their panic attacks and anxiety disorder.

770
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:27,433
By the way, what did Cha Eun-sae

771
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,061
tip you off about yesterday?

772
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:32,188
About her sponsor? Drugs?

773
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:33,981
Or about entertaining people in power?

774
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:40,196
No, it was nothing important.

775
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:41,614
I wouldn't even call it a tip-off.

776
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,533
Are you kidding me? That's disappointing.

777
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:46,077
You don't look too well today, you know.

778
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:49,163
I should go home.

779
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:04,637
I'll be about ten minutes late.

780
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:06,681
Yes, I'll see you in a bit.

781
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:31,164
Unit 1401, Leaders Palace
for appointment at 7:20 p.m.

782
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:50,391
SECURITY CAMERAS
WILL BE INSTALLED EVERYWHERE

783
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:52,059
EXCEPT IN THE PARKING LOT
AND MAIN ENTRANCE.

784
01:02:56,856 --> 01:02:58,191
The door is closing.

785
01:04:56,642 --> 01:04:59,478
Just like Jin, Cha was stabbed
multiple times in the stomach.

786
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:01,522
What? This is a strange coincidence.

787
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:02,773
Could it belong to the killer?

788
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:04,108
Cha Eun-sae is dead!

789
01:05:04,191 --> 01:05:06,986
That means she died
the day after you met her.

790
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:07,945
What's the matter?

791
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:08,905
Jeong-won.

792
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:10,656
Want to hear something shocking?

793
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,700
Cha Eun-sae was three months pregnant.

794
01:05:14,201 --> 01:05:16,621
Why did you go to
the marriage counseling clinic yesterday?

795
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:18,748
Did you follow me?

796
01:05:18,831 --> 01:05:20,583
So she was murdered.

797
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:22,877
Do you have a suspect?
Have you identified someone?

798
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,755
Was something going on
between Ms. Seo's husband and Cha Eun-sae?

799
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:27,715
Did a visitor pick this up for her?

800
01:05:28,382 --> 01:05:30,760
I came to ask you a few questions
about Cha Eun-sae.
