00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:49,299
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

3
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,981
I got info on the truck driver's mother.

4
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,525
I called the phone number to check.

5
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,111
When I said I was a reporter,
she wanted to meet right away.

6
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,780
She probably felt wronged.

7
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:14,949
Hello?

8
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,618
Hello? Are you there?

9
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,286
Oh, yes.

10
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:23,166
Send me her information. I'll meet her.

11
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:32,509
REPORTER RYU JI-HYE

12
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,223
Hello, I'm Reporter Seo Jeong-won.

13
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:41,392
You're Mr. Kim Seok-jun's mother, right?

14
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:45,897
The crazy thing is…

15
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,567
The day I finished my chemotherapy,

16
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,987
I received a call that my son died.

17
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,491
It was ten years ago,

18
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,119
but it feels like yesterday.

19
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:02,080
On December 24, 2009,

20
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,374
your son caused an accident.

21
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:10,130
It was ruled he fell asleep at the wheel,
but my father, then a reporter,

22
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:13,383
suspected it wasn't just an accident.

23
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,801
Someone was behind it.

24
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:17,679
Someone ordered my innocent son to do it.

25
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,597
Is that what your son said?

26
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,767
He denied it,
but he can't fool his mother.

27
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,939
That time, he paid
my overdue hospital bills at once

28
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,900
but couldn't even tell me
who lent him the money.

29
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,697
May I take a look?

30
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:45,206
Do you know if your son met someone
often at the time?

31
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,667
Or did he have someone
visit him often at home?

32
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,463
Well, I do recall seeing him
meet some man in the parking lot

33
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,340
in front of our place a few times.

34
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,842
Did you see that man's face?

35
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,303
I saw them from the balcony.

36
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,353
VIOLENT CRIMES UNIT, SONGO POLICE
GONG JUN-HO

37
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,275
"Violent Crimes Unit, Songo Police,

38
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,443
Gong Jun-ho."

39
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,878
This burner phone.

40
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,796
It was Mr. Gong's number?

41
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,489
The man who killed Dad.

42
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,366
It was Mr. Gong.

43
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,583
The culprit
I so desperately wanted to catch,

44
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,002
the one I wished to face even once,

45
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,505
was right in front of me.

46
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,509
How is this possible?

47
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:29,435
I'll give you one last chance,
so turn yourself in.

48
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,687
Please, do it for me.

49
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,941
Turn in the knife,
and let's go to the precinct together.

50
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:37,694
I guarantee you that
you'll regret this later.

51
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,242
I knew it'd be useless…

52
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,247
but I was hopeful for a moment.

53
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,220
Mr. Gong. I will search you
to find the knife.

54
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,182
Tae-heon!

55
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,709
Tae-heon.

56
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:35,752
Tae-heon!

57
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,709
If you pull it out, I will die.

58
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,330
No!

59
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,833
-Hey.
-Stop.

60
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:18,980
Tae-heon!

61
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,150
Tae-heon.

62
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,568
Tae-heon.

63
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,319
That way. Go that way.

64
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,530
Call an ambulance at once.

65
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,241
Tae-heon, hang in there.

66
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:35,413
This is Ganghwa 120. An emergency patient
at the Jaemi Fishing Ground.

67
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,574
Kim Tae-heon knows now.

68
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,244
-What?
-Seo Sang-gyeon and Cha Eun-sae.

69
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,787
And probably Lee Ba-reun too.

70
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:01,541
I'll lie low.

71
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:05,336
If I'm caught, I'll take your offer.

72
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,327
I don't know how long it'll take.

73
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,500
But will you… wait for me?

74
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,338
Don't make me wait too long.

75
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,485
-Why did you ask to see me?
-Sit down.

76
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:30,296
-Father. Secretary Gong--
-Secretary Gong disappeared.

77
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:35,968
He said he'd vanish
before his crimes surfaced, then hung up.

78
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,388
Don't bother calling Detective Kim.

79
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,015
It's not in the news,

80
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,017
but the police are looking for him.

81
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,020
What do you want to ask about him?

82
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:05,331
Cha Eun-sae, Lee Na-ri
and my dad in the past,

83
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,751
as well as Lee Ba-reun.
This man killed them all.

84
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,587
It's Secretary Gong.

85
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,135
Is there any proof?

86
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,306
I witnessed it myself.

87
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:24,683
Secretary Gong…

88
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,354
killed my dad.

89
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,526
The day Bongto Factory went up in flames,

90
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,736
a truck accident held up the fire trucks.

91
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,113
You know that, right?

92
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,741
Secretary Gong arranged that too.

93
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:45,996
At the time,
the factory burned down completely,

94
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,667
and your plans to build Mujin Resort
sailed right ahead.

95
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,254
My dad was looking into
the corrupt business deals.

96
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,801
Father, were you the one behind it?

97
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:03,055
Do you mean that
I ordered the truck accident?

98
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,348
My father too.

99
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,727
Now that I know
Secretary Gong was behind it,

100
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,439
I have no time or reason to stall.

101
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:16,068
Gong Jun-ho wasn't my secretary in 2009.

102
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:19,488
To be exact,
I didn't know him at the time.

103
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:23,200
He wasn't even stationed at
Mueon Police Station,

104
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:27,371
and he joined Mujin Group
after the resort was complete.

105
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,751
The point is, Mo Hyeong-taek was the one

106
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,670
who introduced him to me.

107
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,300
Secretary Gong worked for Mo Hyeong-taek.

108
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,888
I have men looking for him.

109
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,222
As your father-in-law,

110
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:48,184
I'll do all I can.

111
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,687
For your father's sake.

112
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,285
I don't feel well. I'll head in now.

113
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,258
I'll keep in mind

114
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,637
what you said, Father.

115
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,503
It's okay.

116
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,630
Whatever the truth is,

117
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:03,759
I can get through it. I can manage it.

118
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,555
It's okay.

119
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:21,861
TRUCK CRASH BLOCKS ROAD
DELAYING RESPONSE TO FACTORY FIRE

120
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,267
Mr. Gong promised me he'd take the fall

121
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,352
for everything you did if he gets caught.

122
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,609
The truck accident Jeong-won mentioned.

123
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,742
-What's going on?
-Make way.

124
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,035
Let us through.

125
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,202
DECEMBER 24, 2009

126
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,999
Sir. Are you all right?

127
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,601
You ordered him to cause
the accident too, didn't you?

128
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,278
Father, when I'm your age,

129
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,865
I'll be a monster too, right?

130
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,118
Maybe not.

131
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,578
Maybe I'll be even worse.

132
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,878
Would it be right for my child

133
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,006
to have a dad like me

134
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,426
and a grandfather like you?

135
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,226
In this world, it's one or the other.

136
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,437
You stomp over others,
or you get stomped on.

137
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,608
Do you want your child to be
in the latter category?

138
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:39,873
Voting for the nationwide local election
started four hours ago at 6:00 a.m.

139
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,667
and will continue until 6:00 p.m.

140
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,670
So far, 12.2% of the population voted.

141
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:47,506
This year, 23.14% voted early,

142
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:51,093
and that's the highest percentage
of all previous local and by-elections.

143
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:54,680
We won't know who might win
until at least 9:00 p.m. tonight.

144
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,563
The person you have reached is
unavailable.

145
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,189
DETECTIVE KIM TAE-HEON

146
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,903
Why are you so hard to reach?

147
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,281
-Are you chasing Gong Jun-ho?
-It's me, Ms. Seo.

148
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:15,242
-Why did you pick up?
-Well…

149
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,871
Gosh, that fool.

150
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,414
I told him not to tell you.

151
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,217
They said the surgery went well.

152
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,681
Given how long I've been a cop,
it's surprising this didn't happen sooner.

153
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,813
Why are you being like this?
You're worrying me.

154
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,565
You are worried about me now?

155
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,194
If I lose you too, then I really…

156
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,246
I can handle
not having you by my side, but…

157
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:31,753
I really can't imagine
the world without you.

158
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,756
That, I can't handle.

159
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,889
So you'd better not die, really.

160
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,313
We all die in the end.

161
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:54,484
Just don't… die before I do.

162
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,905
I'm not asking you. It's a threat.

163
00:19:58,572 --> 00:19:59,573
Never forget

164
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,243
what I said. Always remember it.

165
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,457
You know, they say…

166
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,920
when you have a near-death experience,

167
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,758
you think of the person
you cherish the most.

168
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,181
Right before I passed out,

169
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,727
you were all I thought about.

170
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,943
I'll never leave you.

171
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,240
I promise.

172
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,165
Don't cry.

173
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:24,032
When and how did you find out
that Gong Jun-ho was the killer?

174
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:29,037
When you showed me
the man dressed in black in the footage.

175
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:34,126
I remembered Gong Jun-ho's knife
with the tornado symbol on it.

176
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,919
So you started suspecting him?

177
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,130
I'm sorry.

178
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,173
I thought telling you recklessly

179
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:43,552
could put you in danger,
so I couldn't tell you.

180
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:50,559
I regained the memories
of the day my dad died.

181
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,562
I told you that I saw the killer.

182
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,105
I'm sure it was Gong Jun-ho.

183
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:00,068
What if he's already stowed away
or something?

184
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,446
Shouldn't you put out an APB on him?

185
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,073
When he stabbed me,

186
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:08,952
I stabbed him in the thigh too,
so he won't be able to go far.

187
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:13,665
Even so, we don't know
when and if he will be caught.

188
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,585
I put a GPS tracker on his clothes.

189
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,295
-Hey!
-Step aside!

190
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:01,838
Let go!

191
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:03,715
-Hey, push.
-Darn it.

192
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:36,248
If they can't catch a killer
with a tracker, they should quit.

193
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:39,668
I guess Detective Oh had your phone

194
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,962
because he was tracking Gong's location.

195
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,306
Hello. You're with Tae-heon, right?

196
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,225
-Can I talk to him--
-I'm listening, so go on.

197
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,434
Did you catch him?

198
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,061
Yes, come and interview him.

199
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,187
I'm coming now.

200
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:01,773
Tae-heon.

201
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:07,737
He killed my dad,
so let me watch while you interview him.

202
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,892
This was you, wasn't it?

203
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,400
You killed Cha Eun-sae with this knife.

204
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,695
Why did you kill Cha Eun-sae?

205
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,948
Did Seol Woo-jae tell you to do it?

206
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,418
-I did it all on my own.
-So you admit that you killed her.

207
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,629
Why did you kill her?

208
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:09,716
Because Cha Eun-sae
found out that I killed Lee Na-ri.

209
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,968
You killed Lee Na-ri?

210
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,763
-How?
-She jumped in front of my car,

211
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,264
but I didn't see her and hit her.

212
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,474
When did this happen?

213
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:21,144
The evening of December 24, 2009.

214
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,042
Hello, my friend is hurt.

215
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,044
She collapsed.

216
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,547
No, it was an accident.

217
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,344
We're near the Bongto Factory now.

218
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:56,137
This voice.

219
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,974
On the evening of December 24, 2009,

220
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,476
Seol Woo-jae,
who was 19 at the time, called it in.

221
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:05,438
This friend of his who was hurt.
It sounds like Lee Na-ri.

222
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,692
When you hit Lee Na-ri with your car,

223
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,652
was Seol Woo-jae in the car with you?

224
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,034
That voice. Are you sure it was Woo-jae?

225
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,370
Yes, we already confirmed that it was him.

226
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:23,790
I can't believe this.

227
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,627
Back then, I didn't know Mr. Seol Woo-jae.

228
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:31,673
From what I know,
Chairman Seol's driver at the time

229
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:35,510
hit his friend with the car by mistake,
so he called it in.

230
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:37,137
Am I wrong?

231
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:41,933
The day you hit Lee Na-ri with the car
and killed her

232
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:45,562
coincides with the day he reported
his friend's accident

233
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:49,149
-And you say they are not related?
-In 2009, I was a police detective.

234
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:51,359
I had nothing to do with Mujin Group.

235
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:57,532
In 2009, your sister was diagnosed
with a rare disease.

236
00:26:57,615 --> 00:27:00,744
Didn't Chairman Seol Pan-ho
cover her medical bills?

237
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:01,745
I received that money

238
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:05,957
in return for turning a blind eye
to some corruption in the company.

239
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,794
Look into it, and you'll find out.

240
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:13,214
You think you can bury the truth
by getting away like this?

241
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:20,263
This is security footage
from January 10 from Mueonsan.

242
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,807
That day, Seol Woo-jae was in Mueon.

243
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,602
He visited the site
where Lee Na-ri was buried.

244
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:28,021
Lee Ba-reun followed him,

245
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:30,273
so he found out where his sister
was buried.

246
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:35,987
Can I see the still images
from the security footage from Mueonsan?

247
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,300
This is Woo-jae.

248
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,888
Seol Woo-jae denied it was him,
but anyone would say…

249
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:03,264
It is him.

250
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:08,103
I heard Assemblyman Mo's daughter said
Lee Na-ri left the factory that night,

251
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,272
so I told Mr. Seol the truth.

252
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,652
That's why he went there.

253
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:20,281
Murdering Cha Eun-sae,
hitting Lee Na-ri with a car

254
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,410
and burying her in the mountain,
and killing Lee Ba-reun too.

255
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,578
It was all me.

256
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,131
Mr. Seol had nothing to do with it.

257
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:41,511
You want to involve him
because of your personal feelings.

258
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:43,680
I told you.

259
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:45,974
Nothing's more pointless
than being obsessed

260
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:48,810
when there's no chance.

261
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:51,896
Turn off the camera.

262
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:53,940
Okay.

263
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,501
I'm sorry.

264
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,213
For what?

265
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,884
For duping me so far? Or for stabbing me?

266
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,471
I became a detective because of you.

267
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,599
I didn't know you were a murderer.

268
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,563
Even if I want to erase you
from my memory,

269
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,565
each time I see Jeong-won,

270
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:37,817
I'll think of you.

271
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:42,989
Because you made the person
I care about the most so miserable.

272
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:09,057
INTERROGATION ROOM

273
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,903
Why didn't you mention killing my dad?

274
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:26,324
I remembered everything.

275
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,702
You killed my dad.

276
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:33,665
I'm sorry.

277
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,043
You're not sorry!

278
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:41,464
You took so many lives,
but you don't feel an ounce of guilt!

279
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,675
Stop it. He confessed.

280
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,596
From this day on,

281
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,141
I'll pray until you die.

282
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:58,356
That you never stop seeing
the faces of the people you killed.

283
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:03,987
That their pain
seeps into every bone in your body.

284
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,970
GANGHWA POLICE STATION

285
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,694
The day Bongto Factory burned down,

286
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:47,447
a truck accident blocked the roads,
delaying the fire trucks.

287
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,490
This belonged to the dead truck driver.

288
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:53,161
The number is Secretary Gong's
old burner phone number.

289
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:56,122
-Gong Jun-ho was behind that accident too?
-To be more exact,

290
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,540
someone gave him the order.

291
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:04,339
What I need to know about
is the hit-and-run, isn't it?

292
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,634
Woo-jae was in the car, wasn't he?

293
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:15,934
I think Seol Woo-jae

294
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,269
hit Lee Na-ri.

295
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:34,494
-Where's Jeong-won?
-She's not back yet.

296
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:37,413
The chairman's waiting in his study.

297
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:45,463
2024 LOCAL ELECTION VOTE COUNT

298
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:47,048
CANDIDATE 1 HWANG
CANDIDATE 2 PARK

299
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,477
Secretary Gong was arrested.

300
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:01,688
It's for the best.

301
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:06,943
Your wife is on the way home
after watching his interrogation.

302
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,194
Console her.

303
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:09,904
As I console her,

304
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,950
should I say Secretary Gong
didn't kill her father?

305
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:17,412
Should I say it was you?

306
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,999
What would you gain from doing that?

307
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:24,335
SECRETARY JANG

308
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,717
You can go.

309
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:43,938
Did you find out?

310
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:46,858
MO HYEONG-TAEK LIKELY TO WIN

311
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:49,402
So I was right, then.

312
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,492
ASSEMBLYMAN MO HYEONG-TAEK

313
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,581
Congratulations on being elected.
Where are you?

314
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:14,927
I got this far thanks to your support.

315
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,221
Thank you.

316
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:32,278
Is it a gift or a bargaining chip?

317
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:34,030
As if I'd bargain with you.

318
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,951
I forgot my place and acted out.

319
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:40,953
Don't take it to heart.

320
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,958
I should give you a celebratory gift.

321
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:52,590
You gave me more than enough money.

322
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:06,104
I'm sorry about Secretary Gong.

323
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:08,689
Will it be okay?

324
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,486
I silenced the press, so it'll blow over.

325
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:16,322
Everyone's busy minding the election
result right now.

326
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:17,615
Not that.

327
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,869
He worked for you.

328
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,164
He won't mention you, will he?

329
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,917
The murders he committed.

330
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,880
They have nothing to do with you.

331
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:40,054
Don't you hope more than anyone
that I was involved?

332
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,849
Wasn't that why you were looking into
him like a rat?

333
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:47,436
You go too far
whenever you smell a profit.

334
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,982
When we were working on
the first Mujin Resort,

335
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:53,442
you kept digging to find my weakness,

336
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,027
and Seo Sang-gyeon caught on.

337
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,529
You almost went down.

338
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:00,741
You went digging again

339
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,536
and were going to threaten me
for shares, weren't you?

340
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,957
I have something to share about
Secretary Gong.

341
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:11,294
My daughter-in-law suspected
I was behind him,

342
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:14,255
so I told her
I didn't know him at the time.

343
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:18,551
I said I met him
after the resort was done,

344
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,053
and that back in 2009,

345
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:23,472
he worked for you, so keep that in mind.

346
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,808
-What are you up to?
-What?

347
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,227
You erased all traces of him for your sake

348
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:30,771
after the truck accident
by forging the case report.

349
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,523
I did that for you, so--

350
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:33,649
Yes.

351
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:37,403
You did that much so we could build
the first Mujin Resort.

352
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:39,739
Do me another favor.

353
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:41,449
Lie low and keep quiet.

354
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,999
Even if Jeong-won were to bother you,
nothing would change.

355
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,294
All you have to do is keep quiet,

356
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:55,254
like you did before.

357
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,148
Was it fate?

358
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,070
I witnessed Cha Eun-sae's death
and came this far.

359
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,322
It feels like

360
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:27,203
a massive mountain that I can't avoid.

361
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,291
Is that mountain…

362
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:35,920
me?

363
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,382
What should I do?

364
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,093
What about my baby?

365
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:03,614
You're home.

366
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,457
You know that Secretary Gong
was arrested, right?

367
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:18,504
Tae-heon said he suspected Mr. Gong
when I showed him

368
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:20,172
the hidden camera footage.

369
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,468
You realized after seeing
the video too, right?

370
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:29,265
Did you hide it from me in case
I lost control too?

371
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:30,599
No.

372
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:35,062
You kept quiet
because it doesn't end with Mr. Gong.

373
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,524
Your father's behind Mr. Gong,
and perhaps…

374
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:50,619
Why won't you say anything?

375
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:52,496
Because…

376
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:55,958
I can't say anything.

377
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,502
You can't lie anymore,

378
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,963
but you can't admit to anything either.

379
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,132
Is that it?

380
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,093
Keeping quiet is a crime too.

381
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,140
You did a horrible thing not just to me,

382
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:15,269
but also to my child.

383
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:20,107
If you truly care about me and the baby,

384
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,902
you can't do this.

385
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,614
Your love…

386
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,075
is a lie.

387
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:30,743
You're right.

388
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:34,246
My love is a lie.

389
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:38,125
From the moment we met and until now,

390
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,880
I pursued you and clung to you.

391
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:45,883
I'm sorry for wanting so much.

392
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:49,553
Let's call it quits.

393
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,057
I'll divorce you.

394
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:56,435
I'll leave.

395
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:50,406
ASSEMBLYMAN MO HYEONG-TAEK

396
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:54,743
It's been a long time.

397
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:56,537
What's the occasion?

398
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,456
Before I head to Gangwon-do,

399
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,332
I'd like to see you.

400
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,961
I'll text you my address. Let's meet.

401
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,254
What is this about?

402
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:06,714
You won't regret it.

403
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:14,889
I heard about it.

404
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,683
You identified your father's killer

405
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:19,935
after many years.

406
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:22,730
Should I congratulate you

407
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,524
or offer my condolences?

408
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:28,486
You heard who's responsible, didn't you?

409
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,325
To think the killer
was someone you knew well.

410
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:35,409
Goodness.

411
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,620
It must've been a huge shock.

412
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,915
Assemblyman Mo. No, sorry.

413
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:45,461
Don't you know him well too, Governor Mo?

414
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,339
Back in 2009,

415
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:51,509
Gong Jun-ho worked for you,
according to my father-in-law.

416
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,302
Is that true?

417
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:56,347
On December 24, 2009,

418
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,848
the day of the factory fire,

419
00:41:58,265 --> 00:42:00,142
you know there was a truck
accident, right?

420
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:04,897
Did you have
anything to do with that accident?

421
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:08,609
I have a topic

422
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:10,986
more important than that.

423
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:16,367
Your father, Seo Sang-gyeon.

424
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,245
He came to see me the day before he died.

425
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:25,084
JANUARY 9, 2010

426
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:26,710
Despite the fire,

427
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,963
the truth will come out eventually.

428
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,257
You're a journalist,

429
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,968
but you keep ignoring facts

430
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:37,263
and insist
your conspiracy theory is right.

431
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:40,975
There's nothing I can do.

432
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,020
You're trying so desperately

433
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:48,566
to protect Chairman Seol and his family.

434
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:52,820
I wonder if you'd be so relaxed
if another family's crimes were reported.

435
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:53,946
Another crime?

436
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:57,866
Unlike the corrupt resort development,
I have clear evidence

437
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,035
that the crime is fact.

438
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:04,665
I'm keeping it in a safe place
just in case.

439
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:06,959
Even if something happens to me,

440
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:11,213
that evidence
will never be found or disappear.

441
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,632
My dad said that?

442
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:15,175
What is that proof?

443
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:18,554
Don't you think it's up to you to find it?

444
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:28,939
Why are you telling me all this?

445
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,318
I wonder.

446
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:34,653
Why did I tell you?

447
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:38,407
One thing's clear.

448
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:40,618
I only told you the facts.

449
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:45,372
I wish you luck, Ms. Seo.

450
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,674
COMMENDATION

451
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,134
LIEUTENANT GONG JUN-HO

452
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,428
Human life is so fragile.

453
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:04,391
Don't fool around. Search thoroughly.

454
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,517
Yes, sir.

455
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:37,841
This is…

456
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:42,388
-You find something?
-I think this is Jeong-won's father's.

457
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:04,493
What is the clear proof?

458
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,787
Where did he put it?

459
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:14,128
DETECTIVE KIM TAE-HEON

460
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:22,469
Did you see the photo?

461
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:23,971
That's my dad's.

462
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,722
I put that sticker on for him.

463
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:27,891
Where did you find it?

464
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:31,186
At Gong Jun-ho's home.
He took it after the murder.

465
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,480
Was there a memory card?

466
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:34,481
No.

467
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,444
The clear proof.

468
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,280
Is that all?

469
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:42,239
What?

470
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:45,159
I think my dad
hid the memory card somewhere.

471
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,453
I'll call you when I find it.

472
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:02,509
Dad said he kept clear proof somewhere
about my father-in-law.

473
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,513
I think it's a memory card,
so I'm going through his things,

474
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,724
-but I can't find it.
-Forget that.

475
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:10,767
He might have hidden it among your things.

476
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:13,312
Go through the stuff
people keep for a long time.

477
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:15,731
He's your dad.

478
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:18,901
Put yourself in his shoes.

479
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:21,820
Where would you put something crucial
if you were him?

480
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:24,573
In a USB flash drive
or external hard drive.

481
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:28,160
But Dad never gave me such a thing.

482
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:31,622
-What about you?
-He didn't give me anything either.

483
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:37,002
Could he have put it
on the company intranet or a backup site?

484
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:39,213
Your dad died while on the job,

485
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,632
so they'd have deleted any of his files.

486
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:43,634
Knowing my dad,

487
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:46,303
he wouldn't have kept it in one place.

488
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:50,641
Do you know
what backup site he used mostly?

489
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:54,603
Okay.

490
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:57,856
ACCESS MY CONTENTS FAST AND SAFE

491
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:58,941
INCORRECT PASSWORD

492
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,515
Sit down.

493
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:41,692
I've already made up my mind
to leave alone.

494
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:43,026
I won't change my mind.

495
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,404
Mujin Group has been
selected as the winner

496
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:47,239
of this year's Best Managed Company Award.

497
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:51,952
The Almighty is finally rewarding me for
my hard work.

498
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:55,205
This award will help us

499
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:58,041
promote the development of the second
Mujin Resort,

500
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,961
and it'll also help solidify your
leadership.

501
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:02,921
Give an acceptance speech
at the award ceremony

502
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:05,424
so everyone can look up to you.

503
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:09,970
This is a rare chance
to shine in the media spotlight.

504
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:14,224
I have made it clear to you that
I am leaving.

505
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:21,607
You said it yourself that you'd make sure
this project became a success.

506
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,775
Do you think running a company is a joke?

507
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:31,867
There's something you're ignoring.

508
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:36,371
You can deny it all you want,

509
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:38,874
but you are still my son.

510
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:26,004
Let's meet now.

511
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:49,027
Considering how serious your injury was,

512
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,071
you seem to be doing all right.

513
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,447
And you don't seem so well.

514
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,118
Is it because someone is
taking the fall for what you did?

515
00:49:57,869 --> 00:49:59,413
Why are you so upset?

516
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:02,749
Because I dropped the honorifics?

517
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:05,627
Or is it because I'm telling the truth?

518
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:30,944
I understand.

519
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:34,114
She was your first love,
for goodness' sake.

520
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,033
It was an unfortunate accident.

521
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,579
You wanted to save her,
so you called it in yourself.

522
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:43,206
But she died,
and you didn't want to go to jail,

523
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,916
so you hid it all this time.

524
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:48,545
Now that you're becoming a father,

525
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:50,922
I bet you want to
conceal it more thoroughly.

526
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:55,510
Are you done talking?

527
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:04,644
When you told me
that Jeong-won was pregnant,

528
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:05,812
you said this to me.

529
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:10,984
I don't want her to suffer
any pain or hardship.

530
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:12,903
That's why I'd like you

531
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:16,448
to set her free.

532
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:19,785
Help her so she doesn't have to suffer.

533
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:24,289
You needed to hear those words
more than I did.

534
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:29,252
In the past, I was sure
your feelings for Jeong-won

535
00:51:31,087 --> 00:51:33,757
were caused by
your obsession with her, not love.

536
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,051
But that day,

537
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:38,929
after hearing what you said, I realized

538
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,350
that it was love after all.

539
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:51,316
By keeping this up,

540
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:54,820
you will only make Jeong-won suffer more.

541
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:58,740
So give up already.

542
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:27,769
INCORRECT PASSWORD

543
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:41,199
Do I have to give up like this?

544
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:58,550
I'm keeping it in a safe place
just in case.

545
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:00,552
Even if something happens to me,

546
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:04,681
that evidence
will never be found or disappear.

547
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,477
The fact that Dad was so sure

548
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:13,440
probably means it won't be found
even if it was hacked.

549
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:16,276
Was there a different ID?

550
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:49,893
DECEMBER 24, 2009

551
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:53,999
Meet me at the place where we first met.

552
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:55,834
I'll wait for you.

553
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:27,449
Jeong-won.

554
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:29,951
Why did you want to meet here?

555
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,413
The day we first met,

556
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:36,708
you were…

557
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:39,794
staring at the waves.

558
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:45,842
That's right.

559
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,262
Meeting you here that day…

560
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:52,766
felt like a miracle.

561
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:01,107
Jeong-won.

562
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,404
-What's wrong?
-Woo-jae.

563
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:08,656
I know everything.

564
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,326
I saw everything.

565
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:16,915
The videos of the accident my father took.

566
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:21,669
I found them.

567
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:33,807
Why did you do that?

568
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:36,643
Why did you do that? Why?

569
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:41,064
How could you kill someone?

570
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:43,024
How?

571
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:03,128
Jeong-won.

572
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:06,798
What do I do?

573
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,218
I really deserve to die.

574
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:14,764
Kill me, please.

575
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:26,317
Before I met you…

576
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:32,157
I should have just died here.

577
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,328
I regret getting you roped into my life.

578
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:42,625
Jeong-won.

579
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:46,045
I know. I…

580
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:51,176
I know I'm a horrible person.

581
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:59,100
Before you turn into a horrible person,
you must stop here.

582
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:01,519
You have to stop.

583
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:03,313
Look at me.

584
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:05,148
Look at me.

585
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:10,487
You're the only one
who can reveal the truth.

586
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:13,615
My dad…

587
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:16,743
Your father killed him, didn't he?

588
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:25,418
I'm sorry.

589
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,506
I'm really sorry.

590
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:38,014
I'm so sorry.

591
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:47,899
I'm sorry.

592
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:01,996
Until just now,

593
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:07,085
I felt as though it'd swallow us.

594
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:12,465
Let's…

595
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:15,593
just go.

596
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:17,554
Let's go to the police station.

597
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:23,935
Make the right choice.

598
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:25,937
I will go with you.

599
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:30,984
Before you found out about what I did,

600
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:34,571
I kept getting conflicting thoughts
throughout the day.

601
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:38,074
"Shall I just tell her everything?"

602
00:59:38,783 --> 00:59:40,994
"Or shall I hide somewhere alone?"

603
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:48,459
But you've found out…

604
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:52,463
so it's all over.

605
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:56,718
I've let it all go.

606
01:00:00,388 --> 01:00:02,765
I'll do the one last thing I can…

607
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:07,103
and accept punishment for what I did.

608
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:16,779
THE 20TH MANAGEMENT AWARDS

609
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:19,741
The 20th Management Awards.

610
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:22,994
A number of companies
have received awards today.

611
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:26,372
Now, the only award remaining

612
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:29,375
is the Grand Award.

613
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:32,503
I will now announce the winner.

614
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:35,048
All right.

615
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:38,009
This year's Grand Award goes to

616
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:41,512
Mujin Group. Congratulations.

617
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:45,308
MUJIN GROUP

618
01:00:57,862 --> 01:01:01,115
"You were chosen as
the recipient of the Grand Award

619
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:04,494
for your continuous research
and development efforts

620
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:06,663
which have contributed to
stimulating competition

621
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:08,289
in the industry's economic growth

622
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:11,584
while dutifully carrying out your
social responsibilities as a company."

623
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:46,035
I am…

624
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:49,080
a murderer.

625
01:01:53,751 --> 01:01:55,962
On December 24, 2009,

626
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,966
I was responsible for a hit-and-run
and killed someone.

627
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:04,095
-What?
-What is he saying?

628
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,150
Then…

629
01:02:18,776 --> 01:02:22,488
my father buried the body in Mueonsan.

630
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:15,792
Chairman Seol will use
Seol Woo-jae's mental health records

631
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:18,002
and his drug use
to render his statement inadmissible.

632
01:03:18,085 --> 01:03:20,421
How dare you use my son?

633
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:22,048
Father, you will crumble.

634
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:23,591
I will make it happen.

635
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:25,092
Don't think about anything else.

636
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:26,385
Just do what you need to do.

637
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:28,012
Only you can do it.

638
01:03:28,095 --> 01:03:31,015
Why don't we use the media?

639
01:03:31,098 --> 01:03:33,184
Jeong-won, I have a favor to ask.

640
01:03:33,851 --> 01:03:35,645
Finally, I can see the end.

641
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:39,023
I can end my misery
by ending things with you on good terms.

642
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:40,566
Do as you please,

643
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:44,570
but I'll always think of you,
and I'll wait for you.
