1
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:49,340
ALL LOCATIONS, PEOPLE, ORGANIZATIONS, AND
INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,147
Dad!

3
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,066
Hey, sweetie!

4
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:07,650
There you are.

5
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,195
-There you are!
-Dad.

6
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,448
It's okay. Let's go home.

7
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,796
You don't need these.

8
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,339
You already look like a loser.

9
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:30,507
Come on.

10
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,804
Are you using the stake-out
as an excuse to slack off?

11
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,472
I'm hard at work here.

12
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:39,224
Why are you picking a fight?

13
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:43,603
If cops were that hardworking,
there wouldn't be any cold cases.

14
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,355
Which cold case?

15
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:49,234
A reporter was murdered in his own house.

16
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:53,196
Then his daughter
happened to run into the killer.

17
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,828
Her dad was covered in blood.

18
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,665
The moment she knew the killer was there,

19
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,042
she passed out.

20
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,336
She didn't see the killer's face.

21
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,799
If his daughter
had seen the killer's face,

22
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,260
the case would've been solved.

23
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,345
Don't you think?

24
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,108
It's not the daughter's fault.

25
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,277
The police are to blame.

26
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,204
You're right.

27
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:47,000
So I'll catch those criminals
that the police can't catch

28
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,710
and expose them to the world.

29
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,796
Looks like you'll keep me on my toes.

30
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,298
I'll find criminals,

31
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,550
grab them by their hair

32
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:56,843
and teach them a lesson.

33
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:58,303
What do you think?

34
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,222
I think it would be cooler…

35
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,184
to grab them by the collar.

36
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,980
I knew it.
I'm indeed a good judge of character.

37
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,527
This stakeout is taking forever.

38
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,906
I need to go on a date with Detective Kim!

39
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,950
We can count today as our first date.

40
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,162
What should we do first?

41
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,516
The first thing I wanted to do
was kiss you.

42
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:04,118
Your necklace was found
at the scene where Cha Eun-sae…

43
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,121
was murdered.

44
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,166
Ms. Seo Jeong-won,

45
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,626
tell me,

46
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,379
were you at the scene of the crime

47
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,381
the day Cha Eun-sae died?

48
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,518
Were you wearing the necklace
the day you met with Cha?

49
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:34,107
This is the same necklace
as the one you were wearing that day.

50
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,777
No, I wasn't.

51
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,031
But Cha Eun-sae was wearing
the same one that day. I remember it.

52
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,034
This is Cha Eun-sae's.

53
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,870
We had the store run the serial number.

54
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,791
The necklace is registered

55
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,127
under your name.

56
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,962
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

57
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,255
When did you lose it?

58
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,132
Was it before or after
Cha Eun-sae's death?

59
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:01,884
It was after.

60
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:07,056
Let's go back
to the day before Cha Eun-sae died.

61
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,850
What were you doing at her place?

62
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,562
-I told you--
-No, you didn't say much.

63
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,358
But you heard of the affair.

64
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,155
As proof of the affair,

65
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,824
she showed you a pregnancy test
or ultrasound picture.

66
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,747
What you found out that day
could be a motive for murder.

67
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:32,665
Listen--

68
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,626
Your new therapist's nurse
texted you to come to Unit 1401.

69
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,006
I'll ask you again.

70
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,383
Were you at the crime scene

71
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,260
on the day of Cha's murder?

72
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,231
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

73
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,785
Did Ms. Choi say I was at the scene?

74
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:10,703
I wasn't.

75
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,211
Did you question her?

76
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:21,964
Did you ask why she made a typo
that could've sent me to the crime scene?

77
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,133
What was her intention?

78
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,593
Shouldn't you look into that?

79
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:29,222
She insisted it was an innocent mistake.

80
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:30,932
Her alibi checks out too.

81
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,604
There's a 14-minute gap
between when you entered the building

82
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,397
and when you registered at the clinic.

83
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,277
You think I murdered Cha Eun-sae

84
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,780
in those 14 minutes?

85
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,868
Someone with a motive
went up to the 14th floor and killed her,

86
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,870
and we found something of yours there.

87
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,791
As a journalist,
don't you think my suspicion is valid?

88
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,043
Am I

89
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,004
a suspect?

90
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,219
For now, you're still a testifier.

91
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,232
If I were going to kill Cha Eun-sae,

92
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,192
I wouldn't have done it that way.

93
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,702
It was the exact same way
my father was killed.

94
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,705
I don't have the courage

95
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,624
to kill someone in that manner.

96
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:56,100
Write down everything you did
and everywhere you went on October 6th.

97
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,019
Don't leave anything out.

98
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,758
Since I'm still just a testifier,
I'd like to end this interview here.

99
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,677
If you think I'm a suspect,
arrest me right now.

100
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,598
Your husband was a testifier too.

101
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,392
Do you think he had something to do
with Cha's death?

102
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:43,022
Married couples
often cover for each other.

103
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,693
If you and your husband
were to be handcuffed together,

104
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,779
that would be truly unfortunate.

105
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,967
It's only natural you're hurting.

106
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,510
Your affair was made public,

107
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,554
and your wife moved out.

108
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:34,574
They say whatever physical sense
overpowers you in a given moment

109
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,534
dictates if you're happy or not.

110
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:41,747
In other words,
we merely react to our body's senses.

111
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:49,171
What pains you
isn't the fact that your wife moved out.

112
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:56,137
It's down to
the displeasing sensations you feel.

113
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:58,306
Like this.

114
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:03,978
I'm not here

115
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,522
for your theories.

116
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,984
Help me.

117
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:16,782
That dirtbag.

118
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,538
Ms. Cha Eun-sae.

119
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,100
Ms. Seo.

120
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:47,730
Are you okay?

121
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:49,774
Yes.

122
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:52,360
I knew something was off
when you drove over the line.

123
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,321
Call your insurance company,
and get in my car.

124
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,990
Don't worry about it.
It's just a few scratches.

125
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:01,202
-I'm fine.
-Let me drive then. I'm worried.

126
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,329
That's okay.
I'll text when I'm home. Thanks.

127
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,842
I'm glad I did as you said
and followed Ms. Seo.

128
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:20,429
She almost crashed her car,
but drove off saying she's fine.

129
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,099
She's so damn stubborn.

130
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,893
-Okay.
-Wait, Tae-heon.

131
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,770
You're not drinking, are you?

132
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:31,732
That's like poison to you.
You know you're not supposed to drink.

133
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:32,983
I'm not drinking.

134
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,777
Well, it sounds like you are.

135
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,571
I'm more worried about you than Ms. Seo--

136
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:38,656
Whatever.

137
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,040
There's no necklace there.

138
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,418
ZEUS

139
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:37,173
The photos the police took
of Cha's crime scene.

140
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,257
I want them all.

141
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,855
He rejected the results of the first trial
and filed an appeal.

142
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:55,733
Next report.

143
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,527
Celebrity Cha Eun-sae,
who died on 6th October,

144
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,071
was allegedly having an affair
with novelist Seol Woo-jae,

145
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,532
who was called in for questioning
by the police.

146
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:07,828
His wife, Seo Jeong-won,
was called in as a testifier as well,

147
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,330
according to police sources.

148
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,626
The next report
is on Ancheon's Prosecution Office's

149
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,086
obstruction of justice due to blackmail…

150
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,589
ZEUS

151
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,844
You were called in for questioning?

152
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,513
Are you on their radar?

153
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,766
Even you're going to treat me
like a murder suspect now?

154
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,270
Did they track your phone to the building?

155
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,481
Or is there another reason?

156
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,984
You won't resign from Nothing Uncovered

157
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,612
or let it get scrapped, will you?

158
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:44,823
Of course not. I wouldn't let that happen.

159
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,118
I don't want to lose my source of income.

160
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,537
I'll send over the photos.

161
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,702
The killer came back to the crime scene
after I left,

162
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,121
and left my necklace there on purpose.

163
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:18,667
It took the police some time
to find the pendant at the scene.

164
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,673
Celebrity Cha Eun-sae,
who died on 6th October,

165
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,092
was allegedly having an affair
with novelist Seol Woo-jae…

166
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,010
Hello.

167
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,845
…who was called in for questioning
by the police.

168
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,223
His wife, Seo Jeong-won,
was called in as a testifier as well,

169
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,517
-according to police sources.
-Turn that off.

170
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,435
Yes, sir.

171
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:45,402
MET THE DAY BEFORE MURDER

172
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:46,737
Tae-heon.

173
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,199
What if this was Ms. Seo's necklace?

174
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:54,244
Cha Eun-sae could have stolen it
before she died.

175
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,038
I'm on a roll.

176
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,958
I finally caught something
that the ace detective missed.

177
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,544
You don't think I checked
if Cha bought the same necklace?

178
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,338
It was hers.

179
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:08,676
Man! Whatever said and done,
I doubt Ms. Seo killed Cha.

180
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,552
She even said she lost the necklace.

181
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,348
-It could've been tampered with.
-Yeah.

182
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:17,267
Seol could have easily
gotten hold of the necklace.

183
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,186
What if he framed her
in order to save himself?

184
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,480
He could have planned the alibi
ahead of time too.

185
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,732
And she committed the murder?

186
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,985
That's why we need to identify her.

187
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,531
Ta-da.

188
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,701
She went into the building
around the time of death.

189
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,203
The coat and handbag are an exact match.

190
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,287
She's the one.

191
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,707
-How did she exit?
-Through the rear entrance.

192
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,001
Should I go interrogate Seol about it?

193
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:44,712
He'll come to us.

194
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:53,721
SEOL WOO-JAE

195
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,139
Nice.

196
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,905
Did your wife slap you?

197
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,871
I can put up with bullies myself,

198
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,499
but I won't tolerate
you bullying my wife to get to me.

199
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,460
Not everything's about you.

200
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,753
You have an alibi, after all.

201
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,838
Then why was Jeong-won
being interrogated?

202
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,631
You really don't know why?

203
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,259
I think you do.

204
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,730
Today, I'm going to uncover
the sexy novelist, Seol Woo-jae.

205
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,233
-What is this?
-Keep watching.

206
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,611
Why does he make women grow impatient?

207
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:54,156
Why can't that woman and I
come to our senses?

208
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,284
Even if your marriage is perfect,

209
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:59,495
I don't think she would
lose her senses over you.

210
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:04,333
She was referring to this woman,
the one you took to your studio.

211
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:10,798
So Cha knew that there was another woman.

212
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,050
Do you always waste your time
on irrelevant leads?

213
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:16,011
If you think I'm wrong,
then reveal the identity of this woman.

214
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:16,929
No.

215
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,517
It's not that. I just find it hilarious

216
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,145
that you're investigating
something so irrelevant.

217
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,398
Your mistress…

218
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,528
must have wanted Cha Eun-sae dead

219
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:34,738
because of you.

220
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,410
We have footage
of your mistress leaving your studio

221
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,121
and entering Leaders Palace.

222
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,542
We'll have to see whether,
in addition to having an affair,

223
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,294
you two also committed a murder together.

224
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:55,717
Oh, right.

225
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,847
Once I identify the woman,

226
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,932
may I inform Ms. Seo?

227
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:16,155
Sir. I get that
she's involved in a scandal,

228
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,198
but she's our most popular reporter.

229
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,741
Will our show get canceled?

230
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,034
Sir!

231
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,953
Sir, hear me out.

232
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:25,873
We understand that
we're kind of in a state of emergency.

233
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:29,626
So let's buy time by taking a break
and coming up with a plan.

234
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,794
Here's the first option:

235
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,754
We replace Seo Jeong-won.

236
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:36,550
We could change the theme of the show.
That'll be better.

237
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,680
Team Two proposed to replace the show,
and the CEO is thinking about it.

238
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:42,681
It's out of my hands!

239
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,101
Is it the CEO's idea to cancel our show?

240
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,481
I'll be there in five minutes.

241
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,194
Bring her back!

242
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,154
-Bring her back!
-Bring her back!

243
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:59,448
Cancel Nothing Uncovered!

244
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,450
-Cancel it!
-Cancel it!

245
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,994
Seo Jeong-won must resign!

246
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,746
-Resign!
-Resign!

247
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,623
Bring Cha Eun-sae back!

248
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,166
Back out.

249
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,585
Cancel Nothing Uncovered!

250
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,295
-Cancel it!
-Cancel it!

251
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,296
Drive, now.

252
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,260
Bring her back!

253
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,304
-Bring her back!
-Bring her back!

254
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:32,105
Why was your necklace
at Cha's murder scene?

255
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,816
Is this how you show gratitude
for all the support I give you?

256
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,402
Do you think I wanted
to be involved in this case?

257
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,403
I'm a victim too.

258
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,530
It's not just a scandal,
it's a murder case.

259
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,741
You had motive, and now there's evidence.

260
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:45,744
This is nothing compared to
the murder of that housekeeper.

261
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:48,205
So you want to know
if I killed Cha Eun-sae?

262
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:51,250
No, I haven't killed anyone yet.

263
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:57,506
But I'm going to murder
whoever's trying to frame me.

264
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:02,552
We can take a month off
because of the Asian Games.

265
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,680
Give me some time to figure things out.

266
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:08,016
Once the Asian Games are over,
I'll air Cha Eun-sae's episode.

267
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,852
We're going to be replaced
per No's advice.

268
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:14,314
-A new show?
-Yes.

269
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,399
Sir!

270
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:20,779
Sir.

271
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:24,449
You lost your shot at being a news anchor,
and you've lost Nothing Uncovered too.

272
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,868
The CEO ordered it. My hands are tied.

273
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,870
I can't accept that. Never.

274
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,998
There's nothing you can do about it.

275
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:33,250
This is all your fault.

276
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,127
I'm a testifier, not a murder suspect.

277
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,795
People don't care about that.

278
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,464
According to them,
you're as good as a murderer.

279
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:42,092
Give me a chance to find out
who's after me.

280
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:44,970
No reporter could be
more determined than I am.

281
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:48,974
Just worry about
how to end your show on a good note.

282
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,768
I won't let it end,
not after everything I've done.

283
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,145
For three years, I've--

284
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,604
Exactly! You had three years!

285
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:05,449
I went through Cha's call log
and pulled a list of unidentified numbers

286
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:08,827
except those of her brother, manager,
and people she met through work.

287
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,621
See if you can find
more people connected to her.

288
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,041
Gosh, how tedious.

289
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:16,418
You know of a better way
to identify the woman?

290
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,004
I was gonna help, but never mind.

291
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:23,050
-I'd better get started.
-And don't just focus on women callers.

292
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,969
Check out anyone
who might have known Cha, okay?

293
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:39,941
"Song Hyo-seong"?

294
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,905
Song Hyo-seong…

295
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,578
ASSEMBLYMAN MO HYEONG-TAEK'S SECRETARY

296
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:57,334
SONG HYO-SEONG

297
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:58,585
Interesting.

298
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,088
Did you find something?

299
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,590
When we interviewed Mo
for Jin Myeong-suk's case,

300
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,300
he came with his aide. Remember him?

301
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,346
Cha Eun-sae called his aide

302
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,766
three days before she died.

303
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,149
HANKUK UNIVERSITY

304
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,236
SPECIAL LECTURE
BY ASSEMBLYMAN MO HYEONG-TAEK

305
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,321
POLITICS LED BY GEN Z

306
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,410
Detective Kim. What a surprise.

307
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,663
Are you here to listen to my lecture?

308
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,748
I'm here regarding Cha Eun-sae's case.

309
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,626
I have some questions for Mr. Song.

310
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:44,172
Are you sure it's about Cha Eun-sae's case
and not Ms. Jin's case?

311
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:47,801
Yes, I have a few questions for you.
Do you have some time?

312
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:50,887
Please wait for me.
I need to escort Mr. Mo first.

313
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,347
No, that's okay.

314
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,391
I'll go with Ms. Baek.

315
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:56,977
I wonder what it's about.

316
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,772
-Hope you have a nice conversation.
-Thanks.

317
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:06,403
I checked Cha Eun-sae's call history.

318
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:10,073
You called her
three weeks before she died.

319
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:13,160
Then she called you
three days before she died.

320
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,828
What was that about?

321
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,668
3 WEEKS BEFORE CHA EUN-SAE'S DEATH

322
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,092
If I cut my finger off…

323
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,139
would you believe
that my love for you is real?

324
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,265
Look…

325
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:37,767
What's going on here?

326
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,316
Are you all right?

327
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:00,081
Don't call the police.

328
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:04,878
But I'll hold on to your number
just in case I need a witness.

329
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:12,427
Do you remember what he looked like?

330
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,221
It was dark, and he had a cap on.

331
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,515
He was taller than me,
and he was wearing a gray jacket.

332
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:22,354
So then why did she call you
on October 3rd?

333
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:25,023
She offered to buy me lunch
to thank me for my help.

334
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,107
I politely declined.

335
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,484
Three weeks after the incident?

336
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:29,486
I was quite surprised too.

337
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:40,038
Could you tell me where you were between
5:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. on October 6th?

338
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,126
VOLUNTEER WORK

339
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,462
Assemblyman Mo's schedule
ended at 4:00 p.m.

340
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:49,256
I went home after that.

341
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,674
Do you live alone?

342
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,051
-Yes.
-You must be lonely.

343
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,890
CAN'T VERIFY ALIBI.

344
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,155
What's up?

345
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:15,949
Here to see the CEO?

346
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:21,997
Unfortunately he just went to bed,
said he was tired.

347
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:25,709
You sure are stubborn.

348
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,295
Let me give him a call.

349
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:36,928
Hello, sir.

350
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:41,599
I just ran into Jeong-won
in front of your house.

351
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:42,892
Shall I send her in?

352
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:47,230
Okay, understood.

353
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:48,898
Yes, sir.

354
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,652
He'll see you at work.

355
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,614
Well, you must've heard
the title of my new show.

356
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,575
Reporter's Dignity. What do you think?

357
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,704
And what do you know about dignity?

358
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:03,913
Hey, come on.

359
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:07,667
At least I've never been involved
in a murder case.

360
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,421
We'll cover the Cha case first.

361
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:12,922
I'll be interviewing you.

362
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,341
Along with your husband.

363
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,431
Life is so unpredictable, isn't it?

364
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:23,058
That's what makes it fun.

365
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,404
LEE BA-REUN - NEWBIE REPORTER

366
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,573
-Hey.
-Jeong-won.

367
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:41,534
Like you said,
there's an inner circle at the church.

368
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:44,204
Makes sense. It's a big church,
it's been around for years.

369
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:47,999
Also, Chairman Seol
recruited the CEO himself.

370
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,348
I need to talk to you, sir.

371
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,103
Were you about to leave?

372
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:11,523
Yes.

373
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,193
I'll do as you said.

374
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:25,995
I apologize
for causing trouble for the family.

375
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,124
But I didn't do it.

376
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:32,669
Someone planted the evidence
to frame me for the murder.

377
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:36,965
I'm going to find out who did it,
and reveal it on my show.

378
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,388
I heard that

379
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,933
you and our CEO were close,
so I came to you for help.

380
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:50,478
Please persuade him not to cancel my show.

381
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:56,693
Didn't you say that only shameless people
with money and connections

382
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,862
asked for favors and free passes?

383
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,451
I know you only make deals
that benefit you.

384
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:07,328
So I'll do as you say,
whatever that may be.

385
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,999
I'll get the divorce proceedings started,
and I won't ask for alimony.

386
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,336
You'll have the pleasure
of kicking me out of your family,

387
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,423
-in exchange for my show--
-You always know how to irk me.

388
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,259
If you wanted to make a deal with me,

389
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:23,595
you should've thought about
what's best for my family.

390
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:29,017
You abandon your husband over a scandal,
and in turn I kick you out of the family?

391
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,643
What would people say?

392
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:36,983
Now go back home to Woo-jae,
and stay by his side like a good wife.

393
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,653
And behave yourself
until the case is closed.

394
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,909
What? Have I asked for too much?

395
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,245
It's up to you

396
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:52,415
whether you want to save your show
or protect your pride.

397
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:13,520
I'll move out, so please come home.

398
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:14,896
I'm worried.

399
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,815
How chivalrous of you.

400
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:19,192
I'm in this mess because of you.

401
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,904
I want to die right now.

402
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:23,822
Then die.

403
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:31,746
Jeong-won, why did the police

404
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,040
interview you?

405
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:39,921
You don't know why?

406
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:41,840
I thought you would.

407
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:43,383
I'm sure you do.

408
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,719
Detective Kim said the exact same thing.

409
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,513
What is it? Can't you tell me?

410
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,725
I don't understand you at all.

411
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:53,935
I don't know who you are.

412
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,520
I don't even know if you're human.

413
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:00,733
When news about the murder came out,
you didn't seem worried at all.

414
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:01,943
In fact, you seemed cold.

415
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,113
You know what I think?

416
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,990
You either hid your emotions very well,

417
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:09,242
or weren't bothered by her death.

418
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,872
When the truth gets out,
I'll find out what you really are.

419
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,416
A human or a monster.

420
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,748
"NOTHING UNCOVERED" PREMIERE

421
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,337
The CEO ordered it. My hands are tied.

422
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,088
Worry about how to end your show.

423
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,131
It's up to you

424
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:08,968
whether you want to save your show
or protect your pride.

425
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,737
We wanted to talk to you in person
about your text.

426
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:29,489
We have some questions.

427
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:30,573
Okay.

428
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:34,619
I'll do everything I can
to help you catch the jerk.

429
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:39,332
So, she asked you to find her a bodyguard
the day before she died?

430
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,043
Yes, out of the blue.

431
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:45,129
I asked if there was a stalker
or a fan who was obsessed.

432
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,298
She just asked me to find one
as soon as possible.

433
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:52,261
We heard that
a man threatened her with a knife

434
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:55,890
near the rear entrance of Leaders Palace
about three weeks ago.

435
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:58,351
Had anything like this happened before?

436
00:32:58,434 --> 00:32:59,477
Really?

437
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,230
I don't think so.

438
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,649
We heard he was wearing a gray jacket.

439
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:07,235
Does anyone come to mind?

440
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,486
A gray jacket?

441
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,490
Could it be that guy?

442
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,120
They sent so many gifts.

443
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:19,163
They're the source of my energy lately.

444
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,249
-I'll put them here.
-Okay.

445
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,295
Oh, my God.

446
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,924
I came to check the windows and walls
for condensation.

447
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,178
You should come back later
when the office is open.

448
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:35,888
You can go now.

449
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,854
Hey.

450
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:48,526
You look nicer in tight clothes
than in baggy stuff.

451
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,072
What did he say? Is he insane?

452
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,867
Would you be able to recognize him
from a photo?

453
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,202
RESUME

454
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:07,837
Excuse me.

455
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:11,799
Could you tell me who was on patrol
the night of October 6th?

456
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,342
Sure. Just a moment.

457
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:14,594
Thanks.

458
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,390
Hey.

459
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:21,350
I think this is him.

460
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:25,772
Kim Min-cheol?

461
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,815
Jung was on duty that morning.

462
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:30,985
And Kim Min-cheol
worked the afternoon shift.

463
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,406
Where does he sit?

464
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,365
Over there.

465
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,715
Jeez, what a weirdo.

466
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,013
SEOL WOO-JAE
UNTIL OCTOBER

467
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,143
Where's Kim Min-cheol now?

468
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,124
What are you filming?

469
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,000
Sorry?

470
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:30,878
Are you Kim Min-cheol?

471
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,463
Oh, Min-cheol's…

472
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,173
Hey! Min-cheol!

473
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,261
Damn you!

474
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,892
God damn it!

475
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:46,435
Hey!

476
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:49,856
Stop!

477
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,156
Stop running!

478
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,577
I've got a cramp.

479
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,083
I knew it.

480
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:22,763
Please let me go.

481
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:27,435
You must have done something bad
if you're begging for your life.

482
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:31,898
I'll try to get the money somehow,
as soon as possible.

483
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,900
Forget the money. I'm a detective.

484
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,277
I'm confiscating this.

485
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,737
Detective Oh.

486
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,365
Did you threaten to cut yourself
in front of Cha Eun-sae?

487
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,286
How do you know Seol Woo-jae?

488
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:51,334
I went to high school with Woo-jae. Why?

489
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:55,755
What does this mean?

490
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,091
I wanted to borrow money.

491
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,345
So you called him? Did he give you a loan?

492
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,262
Yes.

493
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,473
Why are you…

494
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,142
Why are you doing this to me?

495
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:13,731
Come to Gangha Station tomorrow,
and I'll tell you why.

496
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,948
If you don't, I'll raid your house.

497
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,371
-Damn it.
-Detective Oh.

498
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:33,876
I think he dumped his phone somewhere.

499
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,753
Follow him.

500
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:37,630
Punish her for murder!

501
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,465
-Punish her.
-Punish her.

502
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:42,426
Cancel Nothing Uncovered!

503
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,053
-Cancel it!
-Cancel it!

504
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,764
There she is! You murderer!

505
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,183
-You murderer!
-You killed Eun-sae!

506
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,060
-How could you?
-Murderer!

507
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,816
Bring Cha Eun-sae back!

508
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:58,859
-You murderer!
-Bring her back!

509
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,404
Stop. Don't throw eggs at her.

510
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,572
-Bring her back!
-Stop!

511
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,658
CANCEL "NOTHING UNCOVERED"

512
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:09,662
My husband and I

513
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,331
have caused you people distress.

514
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,542
For that, I'm sorry.

515
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:16,210
Also,

516
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:20,881
I feel great remorse
and offer heartfelt condolences

517
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:23,342
over Cha Eun-sae's passing.

518
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:25,261
Get lost, murderer!

519
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:26,887
-You killed her!
-Damn you!

520
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,598
-Get lost, murderer!
-Don't lie to us!

521
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:32,852
Why did the police question
you and your husband?

522
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:33,936
What did they ask you?

523
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,315
Were you questioned because
you were connected to Cha's death?

524
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:43,154
The questions I was asked
are part of an ongoing investigation.

525
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:46,115
I hope you understand
why I can't disclose any details about it.

526
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:50,286
Was Cha having an affair
with your husband, Seol Woo-jae?

527
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:54,623
No.

528
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,840
SEO SAYS, "SEOL AND CHA WERE NOT DATING"

529
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:04,508
That's nonsense.

530
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:08,763
Is that true?

531
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:11,515
It is.

532
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:12,975
They weren't dating.

533
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:15,478
But weren't the photos taken
at your husband's studio?

534
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,313
-If that's not--
-Sir, please.

535
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,108
Even if they were dating,

536
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:23,319
it doesn't change anything.

537
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:27,281
I still believe in my husband.

538
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:32,912
And I love him.

539
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:36,207
-What?
-Sounds like a lie.

540
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,958
-What nonsense is that?
-No way.

541
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,794
-That's stupid.
-I know.

542
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:42,797
Someone reported today
that you two were separated.

543
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:44,840
That's not true.

544
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:48,052
Are you denying the affair,
or are you saying you forgive him?

545
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,845
As I've said already,

546
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:53,099
the support I offer my husband
is unwavering.

547
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:56,018
What do you have to say
about Cha's murder?

548
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,229
I hope the killer is caught soon.

549
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,147
Being a journalist myself,

550
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:04,527
I'll be following the story closely
until the truth is revealed.

551
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:08,614
Do you think there's any possibility
you'll end up as a suspect in this case?

552
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:14,578
Of course not.

553
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,956
-The recent rumors…
-Cancel the show!

554
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,129
Why did you go and stoke the fire?

555
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:24,880
You've only made things worse.

556
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,258
My silence would've been taken for guilt.

557
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,264
Wipe that off. It's not a Medal of Honor.

558
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,269
The show's still on for now.

559
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:42,815
That was a close call.

560
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:46,569
-Thanks for having our back.
-Thank you.

561
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,822
You should thank Team Two.
Their proposal got scrapped.

562
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:51,740
I bet the big boss wasn't satisfied.

563
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:55,327
There's no way they can create a show
that would replace ours.

564
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:56,579
That's impossible.

565
00:40:57,746 --> 00:41:00,499
What did you mean, "for now"?
We could still get canceled?

566
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,042
Those are the words the boss used.

567
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,128
Might have something to do
with the schedule.

568
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:06,422
Jeong-won has lost her credibility
with the public.

569
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:10,509
Okay, we have a taped show to air
next week.

570
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:12,928
The Asian Games start the week after that.

571
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:16,307
So you have a month to bring me a story
that'll turn around public sentiment.

572
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,725
That's your only way out.

573
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:20,686
Nothing could bring us more success
than finding Cha's killer.

574
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:26,066
The boss said
nobody was to mention that name.

575
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,110
Drop that story. I'm warning you.

576
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:33,949
Hey.

577
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,494
He did have an affair.

578
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:38,287
And you did move out.

579
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,539
So why are you acting like a martyr?

580
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,500
"I love him."

581
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,168
You managed to anger Cha's fans

582
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,504
and alienate your own fans too
with that little stunt.

583
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:49,840
The website's flooded with comments
from people saying they want you gone.

584
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:52,343
What will you do
if next week's story bombs?

585
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:53,469
Take the fall for it?

586
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,305
Do whatever you want!

587
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,606
Ae-na.

588
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,317
I know that because of me…

589
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:10,486
It came as shock to me

590
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,906
that you of all people
defended your cheating husband.

591
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,409
You know why I swore to stay single.

592
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:22,039
That jerk kept his married life a secret
so he could toy with me.

593
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:24,291
I almost lost my mind.

594
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,086
You know that better than anyone.

595
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,258
-Ae-na--
-I can look past almost anything else.

596
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:36,929
But not this.

597
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,431
It feels like

598
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:41,308
you're a stranger.

599
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,239
The Cha Eun-sae story…

600
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:58,742
Will you be dropping it?

601
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,342
NOTHING UNCOVERED

602
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,108
NURSE CHOI HYE-WON

603
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:38,157
Ms. Seo.

604
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,492
I'm sure I've caused you a lot of trouble.

605
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:43,954
-I told the detective because--
-I know.

606
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:47,416
It's because I suspected that
you sent me the wrong number on purpose.

607
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,628
To be honest, I did suspect you.

608
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:53,172
It was an honest mistake, I swear.

609
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:55,674
I wanted to tell them the truth.

610
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,926
I thought it would be better
for both of us.

611
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:01,972
Besides, I was pretty close
to Cha Eun-sae.

612
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,475
Is that so?

613
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:06,518
Somehow I ended up becoming her friend.

614
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,020
So I felt even worse about it.

615
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:09,313
I hope you understand.

616
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:12,024
Don't worry about it.

617
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:14,068
See you next time.

618
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,165
NURSE CHOI HYE-WON
YOU & ME CLINIC

619
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:34,088
REQUESTED

620
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:48,727
Coming.

621
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:04,701
What are you doing?

622
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,286
That's what I want to ask you.

623
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,415
You cut a deal with him?

624
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:12,084
He promised to help, so you defended him?

625
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:13,585
You should leave.

626
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,087
Is he threatening you?

627
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,257
Did he find out that you did it?

628
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,134
Leave.

629
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,970
I get it now.

630
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:26,014
You've been working together all along.

631
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:29,852
Detective Kim,

632
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,312
if we were accomplices,

633
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:36,442
why would I want to get to the bottom
of my husband's affair?

634
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:38,193
Think about it.

635
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:42,156
One possibility is that
Seol made sure he had an alibi

636
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,950
and hired someone to kill Cha Eun-sae.

637
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:46,660
But you killed her first.

638
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:51,665
Or Seol hired someone
to kill Cha Eun-sae,

639
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:54,126
and the killer did it.

640
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:57,212
You found Cha Eun-sae

641
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:59,256
but you didn't help her.

642
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:01,008
You just let her die.

643
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:02,634
-That's not true.
-Which part?

644
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,470
Killing her? Letting her die?

645
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,693
-Step aside.
-Stop. What are you doing?

646
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:20,611
Seo Jeong-won!

647
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:05,364
I got my hands on the crime scene photos
after you interviewed me.

648
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,491
Someone put my necklace

649
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,410
in Cha Eun-sae's hand to frame me.

650
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:14,289
You're a cop.

651
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:17,334
You can't just barge into
a woman's hotel room.

652
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:18,460
Are you out of your mind?

653
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:20,337
Are you?

654
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,966
How could you say
you trust that cheating scumbag?

655
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,760
You should've said you wanted to kill him!

656
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:28,512
I hate him so much that I want to.

657
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:29,846
But I also love him.

658
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:41,400
Please leave.

659
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:53,954
Hey!

660
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:01,420
Did your husband buy this for you?

661
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:03,797
Why? Why are you taking a photo of that?

662
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:06,216
When you go back home to him,

663
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,344
ask him who else
he bought this same coat for.

664
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:12,889
-What?
-The day Cha was murdered,

665
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:14,808
Seol was in his studio with another woman.

666
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:16,810
And she went into Leaders Palace that day.

667
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:20,272
That must be why your husband
is trying to conceal her identity.

668
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:26,278
Exactly how many women
is your husband cheating on you with?

669
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:31,617
Say that again.

670
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,327
Another woman? What woman?

671
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:37,122
I gave you a heads-up about your husband.

672
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:44,398
Am I dreaming?

673
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:50,696
What are you doing?

674
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:54,408
I saw you on TV.

675
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:56,451
Thank you.

676
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:58,620
I didn't do it for you.

677
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:03,125
I know.

678
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,795
I decided to join my father's company.

679
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:09,339
So he agreed to help you.

680
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,260
I'll get rid of my studio soon.

681
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:15,178
You'll stop

682
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:17,514
writing novels?

683
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,144
They don't matter to me…

684
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:26,064
as long as I have you by my side.

685
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:32,404
I could put up with anything,

686
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:34,865
but not having you…

687
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:39,327
in this house was unbearable.

688
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,956
-Listen…
-When you go back home to him,

689
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:46,460
ask him who else
he bought this same coat for.

690
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:51,715
You take the bedroom.

691
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,425
I'll sleep in the study.

692
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:56,052
No. You should sleep in the bed.

693
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:57,721
From now on, just do as I say.

694
00:50:57,804 --> 00:50:58,805
If you don't,

695
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:00,474
I'll just move out again.

696
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:36,802
What are you doing?

697
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:45,685
I had lost one of my flash drives.

698
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:47,020
It was here.

699
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,356
Really?

700
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:51,149
Why are you up?

701
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:53,026
I got thirsty.

702
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,654
Are you having trouble sleeping?

703
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,366
I'm going out for a drive.

704
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:48,081
RECORDING 014

705
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:51,793
Chief editor,
I wanted to talk about something.

706
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:58,049
Father, I'd rather die
than leave Jeong-won.

707
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:55,398
I think your return means that…

708
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:59,402
you'll give me another chance.

709
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,989
Even if you deny it,
that's what I'll believe.

710
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:10,497
I'll spend the rest of my life

711
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:12,749
making it up to you.

712
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:14,584
Don't bother.

713
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:17,253
I still won't forgive you.

714
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:21,841
But you gave up your writing for me.

715
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:24,219
So I'll give you a chance.

716
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:42,153
Thank you so much.

717
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:44,823
Thank you.

718
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,833
I won't let you down again.

719
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:58,670
I won't lose out on this chance.

720
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:05,635
I'm the one
who won't lose out on this chance.

721
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:08,555
The chance

722
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:11,349
to see you crash and burn.

723
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:14,436
That's what I vowed

724
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:16,730
at that very moment.

725
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:20,483
I get that you want revenge,

726
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:24,237
but I'm not entirely sure
what you're planning to do.

727
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:31,244
We just have to be careful.

728
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,579
Jeong-won will never know.

729
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:35,040
Remember,

730
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:38,752
neither you nor I was at the scene.

731
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:44,215
My husband,

732
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:46,217
he was…

733
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:49,179
He was at Cha's office the day she died.

734
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:53,516
Do you think that your husband

735
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:55,602
could be her killer?

736
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,981
He has an alibi.

737
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,442
But the person he's talking to,

738
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:04,778
that must be the killer.

739
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,199
So then

740
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:12,202
your husband knows who the killer is.

741
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:14,079
He's protecting them too.

742
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:17,332
He even planted evidence
to make me look guilty.

743
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:20,668
They're probably accomplices.

744
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:27,634
This recording…

745
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,720
Did you show it to the detective?

746
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,684
If I do,
he'll interrogate my husband again.

747
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:38,269
And my husband

748
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:42,857
will try even harder to hide his secret.

749
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:47,153
Why are you telling me all this?

750
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:51,199
As a doctor,

751
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:54,619
you're bound by
doctor-patient confidentiality.

752
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:57,580
And it can only be breached

753
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,833
with my permission.

754
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:05,505
Think of it as insurance.

755
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:08,383
If something were to happen to me,

756
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:13,012
I'd like you to tell the detective
what I just told you.

757
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:18,560
What Seol Woo-jae is really like,
and what he's done.

758
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:21,688
I'm going to expose him

759
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:24,190
on air.

760
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:31,906
That means

761
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:36,369
you're going to war, Jeong-won.

762
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:46,963
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I need to take this call.

763
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:59,642
LOCATION: MUJIN PROVINCE
JEONGJIN-GIL 78

764
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,645
When you go back home to him,

765
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:46,564
ask him who else
he bought this same coat for.

766
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:49,776
The day Cha was murdered,
Seol was in his studio with another woman.

767
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,861
And she went into Leaders Palace that day.

768
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:55,990
That must be why your husband
is trying to conceal her identity.

769
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:10,797
DETECTIVE KIM
In case you'd like to see it

770
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:36,489
The other woman

771
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:38,408
is Yoo Yun-yeong?

772
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:09,856
You called it war,

773
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:11,983
didn't you?

774
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:14,652
Sorry?

775
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:56,527
She can't reveal the sessions she filmed.

776
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:57,570
What did she film?

777
01:00:57,654 --> 01:01:00,239
Dr. Yoo, she films all her sessions.

778
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:01,449
Jeong-won.

779
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:02,867
Hello.

780
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:07,163
What if Jeong-won were to find out
we had been close for a long time?

781
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:09,248
Woo-jae and Min-cheol
graduated from Mueon High School.

782
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:10,625
Cha Eun-sae was also from Mueon.

783
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:12,710
Mo Hyeong-taek was in Mueon too.

784
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:15,963
Everyone related to the Cha case
used to live in Mueon?

785
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:17,799
Everyone but Seo Jeong-won.

786
01:01:17,882 --> 01:01:20,718
I saw your shirt that night.
There was blood on it.

787
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:22,595
I must know the truth to protect you.

788
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:23,971
Everyone thinks Seo Jeong-won

789
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:27,225
and her husband
are connected to Cha Eun-sae's death.

790
01:01:27,308 --> 01:01:28,810
I could've killed her.

791
01:01:28,893 --> 01:01:32,105
You're openly calling me the culprit now.

792
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:35,066
Convince me. Why aren't you accomplices?

793
01:01:35,149 --> 01:01:37,235
You picked the wrong guy to mess with.

794
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:40,571
I'll reveal who killed Cha Eun-sae.
