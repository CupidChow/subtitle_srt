LOCATIONS, PEOPLE, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,384
DESIRE

3
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,492
It was the exact same knife.

4
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,788
The real culprit in Cha Eun-sae's murder…

5
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:22,040
wasn't Soo-rin.

6
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,543
It was your husband.

7
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,306
Jeong-won.

8
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,394
You came back?

9
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,313
I'd forgotten some of my things.

10
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:46,815
I came for them.

11
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,404
Did you skip work today?

12
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:54,864
Yes.

13
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,283
You didn't wear hats
because they suffocated you.

14
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:01,579
You're right.

15
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,835
Where have you been?

16
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:10,547
I couldn't focus,
so I walked all day long.

17
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:14,092
I kept noticing kids while I was walking.

18
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:18,429
"Will it be a boy or a girl?"

19
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:22,267
"Who will he or she resemble?"
That's all I could think about.

20
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:26,771
I'll be staying here. Just tonight.

21
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,065
It's your father's death
anniversary, right?

22
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:36,489
Right. I forgot to buy a cake.
Can you get one from nearby?

23
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,782
Sure.

24
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:42,954
Hello?

25
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,124
Okay.

26
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,878
Are you craving anything
other than cheesecake?

27
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,004
Anything will do.

28
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,630
I won't be long.

00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,280
HAESIN-RO 122
MUEON - GANGWON-DO

30
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,450
Why was he in Mueon?

31
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,311
Were you about to go out?

32
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,188
No.

33
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:24,055
I got one of everything.

34
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,725
What do you want?

35
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,227
I'm not hungry now.

36
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,858
Do you have morning sickness?

37
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:39,737
Ms. Yang doesn't cook. What do you eat?

38
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:43,116
I don't want to…
discuss these things with you.

39
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,205
What should we talk about, then?

40
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,960
You don't like
talking about your dad, either.

41
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:59,007
Talking about memories might
remind you of his death and make you sad.

42
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:13,688
You said you were drinking alone
in your studio…

43
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,899
at the time of Cha Eun-sae's death, right?

44
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,904
Yes. Why did you bring that up
all of a sudden?

45
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,242
I'm tired.

46
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,536
I'm going to bed.

47
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,678
Dad.

48
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,014
Dad.

49
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,698
SEO JEONG

50
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,167
Seo Jeong-won.

51
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,925
What are you doing here this early?

52
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,970
What else could it be? I missed you.

53
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,023
I'm headed to Mueon.

54
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,985
I dropped by on the way.

55
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,070
Why go there?

56
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,239
To find Lee Na-ri?

57
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,576
I spoke to the detective there.

58
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,121
When I mentioned Na-ri's escape
from the factory that night,

59
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,372
he suggested I meet someone.

60
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:41,502
A woman, an illegal immigrant,
had been reported missing…

61
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,130
and she worked at the Bongto factory.

62
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,466
Then…

63
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,676
The body Lee Ba-reun collected…

64
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,679
is even less likely to be Lee Na-ri's.

65
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,348
I'll tell you if I find anything.

66
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,937
You're still feeling low.

67
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,234
I lost my job…

68
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,653
and am staying with a friend.

69
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,447
It'd be weird if I weren't.

70
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:11,574
You're right.

71
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,995
Anything I can do to cheer you up?

72
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,175
I'm sharing my energy. To recharge you.

73
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,934
From now on,
I'll be living off my own efforts.

74
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,436
So you can…

75
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,481
take all my luck.

76
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:46,859
Cheer up.

77
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,126
Detective Kim Tae-heon.

78
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,338
Show him your friend's picture.

79
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:09,465
I've filled him in.

80
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:20,309
That's her. Her name is Jang Hwa-ran.

81
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,395
-How old was she then?
-Twenty.

82
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,480
She was about 165cm tall.

83
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,983
She had a similar build as Lee Na-ri.

84
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,277
When exactly did you report her missing?

85
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,528
On the 26th.

86
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,822
We'd agreed to spend Christmas together.

87
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,824
But she wasn't home. She just disappeared.

88
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,076
Did she really work part-time

89
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,704
at the Bongto factory on the 24th?

90
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:44,458
Yes. She told me she had to work
and changed our appointment to the 25th.

91
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:48,713
You didn't actually see her go
to the factory on the 24th, did you?

92
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,549
Well, I didn't, but…

93
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,219
that's when she disappeared,
and she isn't back yet.

94
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,567
This area has a significant number
of undocumented immigrants.

95
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,444
They go missing all the time.

96
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:15,656
We'd returned all bodies to the families,
so we didn't think much of it.

97
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,702
Mo Soo-rin saw Lee Na-ri run away.

98
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,203
I didn't really believe her,

99
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,623
but it does bother me.

100
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,917
But if she never came home…

101
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,754
She could've inhaled toxic fumes.

102
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:32,590
Maybe she passed out on the way back.

103
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,802
I wish there were records of calls
to the police or paramedics.

104
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,348
Hang on.

105
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,310
We must have emergency call records.

106
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,355
You think we might still have them?

107
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:48,648
Yes, I do.

108
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,150
Could I get copies of them?

109
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:54,820
What if there was an emergency call
reporting that someone passed out?

110
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,492
I'm also starting to wonder
if the body we found at the factory

111
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,494
belonged to Lee Na-ri or someone else.

112
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:06,082
It was ages ago.
Even the locals forgot about the factory.

113
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,958
There are upscale buildings now.

114
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,544
What's at the site of the factory?

115
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,046
Mujin Resort.

116
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:15,841
They redeveloped the entire area.
Mujin Construction made a fortune.

117
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:19,220
Mujin Construction?
A subsidiary of Mujin Group?

118
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:20,137
Yes.

119
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:24,725
As a matter of fact, I saw on the news
that they'd build another resort there.

120
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,133
Your sister, Lee Na-ri,

121
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:00,678
might not have died in the fire
at the Bongto Factory.

122
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,432
Mo Soo-rin saw Lee Na-ri running away.

123
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,393
Call me when you see this note.

124
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,865
Lee Ba-reun's phone is still off.

125
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,200
His parents haven't spoken to him
in a while.

126
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,661
He used Ms. Seo
to get justice for his sister.

127
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:28,873
When he finds out that
his sister ran away from the factory,

128
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,374
he's going to be so shocked.

129
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,127
Let me know if his phone turns on.

130
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:40,426
BUS STOP - MUEON BEACH

131
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,681
DETECTIVE KIM TAE-HEON

132
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,433
You recognize the place, don't you?

133
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:05,261
The pipes aren't exposed or anything.

134
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,722
Will your husband be using
this office again, or is it for you?

135
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,978
There's only one way
in and out of the building, right?

136
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,814
Is there another way
to get out of the building?

137
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:18,315
Not here.

138
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,194
Right. There's a back alley
connected to the first-floor cafe

139
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,946
run by Assemblyman Mo's daughter.

140
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,865
A back alley connected to the cafe?

141
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,908
What? Where did you hear that?

142
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,952
We rarely use that path.

143
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,538
It leads outside through the storage room.

144
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,832
Can you show me where it is?

145
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,802
If Woo-jae found out about it
through Soo-rin,

146
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,555
his alibi could be called into question.

147
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,356
Jeong-won.

148
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:01,734
Your note, is it true?

149
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,361
Let's meet. We need to talk in person.

150
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,738
Where are you?

151
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,707
I'm here.

152
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,833
Me too.

153
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,006
Did Mo Soo-rin really say

154
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,008
that she saw my sister running away?

155
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,803
Whose corpse did my family receive, then?

156
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:32,640
How is this possible?

157
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,308
I don't know the details.

158
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:38,604
But an undocumented female worker
was reported missing back then.

159
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:42,399
She worked part-time
at the Bongto Factory.

160
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:44,860
Due to the fire…

161
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,447
her DNA couldn't be confirmed, right?

162
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,950
If Mo Soo-rin is telling the truth…

163
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:53,577
how come…

164
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,418
how come my sister
still hasn't come back to us?

165
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,879
-Why on earth--
-Maybe she died…

166
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,048
in a different location. Don't you agree?

167
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,511
You knew that the factory arsonist
wasn't Park Jin-su.

168
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:14,139
You found Mo Hyeong-taek,
the prosecutor in charge, suspicious.

169
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:21,188
Is that why you used me?
I exposed Mo Hyeong-taek to the public.

170
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:24,858
Did you want me to be the first eyewitness
to Jin Myeong-suk's murder?

171
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,446
THE DAY OF JIN MYEONG-SUK'S MURDER

172
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,031
Why is her phone switched off?

173
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,568
NIKE

174
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:12,031
We've located…

175
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,492
Lee I-jin's burner phone.

176
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:17,619
Jeong-won.

177
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:23,250
I involved you in this for a reason.

178
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,837
Your father died wrongfully, right?

179
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,881
Just like my sister did.

180
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:32,509
Your father…

181
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,887
I'd met him before.

182
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,389
This must have been tough. Thank you.

183
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,058
RIGHT AFTER FIRE AT BONGTO FACTORY

184
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:40,768
You're home, Ba-reun.

185
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,854
So, you're Ba-reun.

186
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,444
KOREA BROADCAST MEDIA
SEO SANG-GYEON - REPORTER

187
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:54,073
I'll write an article based on interviews
with the bereaved families.

188
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,616
So people don't forget.

189
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,410
Why did you let him interview you?

190
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,704
It won't bring my sister back.

191
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,525
Do you know where I am right now?

192
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:33,737
I'm at the house of a victim you murdered.

193
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:38,033
It's your call. Which truth will you bury?

194
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,536
And which truth will you reveal?

195
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,080
My father? Who could it be?

196
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,749
Two weeks later, I saw on the news

197
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:50,170
that he was murdered
by an unidentified assailant at his house,

198
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,382
and that the police
were pursuing the killer.

199
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,885
I knew the moment I saw the news

200
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,221
that the killer
was the one he spoke to that day.

201
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,935
I first found out about you
through your show.

202
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,896
When I found out that Seo was your father,

203
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:09,857
I thought it was fate.

204
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,861
My sister and your father

205
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,612
were murdered by the same person.

206
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:19,324
After discovering the truth
about Na-ri's death,

207
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,493
he threatened someone.

208
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,621
If that's what got him killed…

209
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,082
Who on earth was on the phone?

210
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,209
Actually…

211
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,297
I went down to Mueon a while ago, and…

212
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,051
Never mind.

213
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,763
We'll talk once my hunch is verified.

214
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,432
What is it?

215
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,350
I'll be in touch, Jeong-won.

216
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:50,314
Let's grab a drink next time,
like we used to.

217
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,149
Ba-reun. Lee Ba-reun!

218
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,401
Ba-reun!

219
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,742
The person you have called is unavailable.

220
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,252
-She's pregnant?
-Yes.

221
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,421
-Are you sure it's yours?
-Dad.

222
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:18,175
I thought I'd never be lucky enough
to be a grandfather.

223
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,803
The case is closed.

224
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,182
She got pregnant right when we resumed
our second resort plan.

225
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,809
The Lord has given us a big blessing.

226
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:35,484
Truth is, I wanted to be a father
much more than you ever did.

227
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,653
But I didn't want to pressure Jeong-won.

228
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,447
So I just didn't show it.

229
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:46,119
All the things you did for my sake,
as a father, were terrible.

230
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:50,207
But now that I'm becoming a father myself,

231
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,750
I finally understand…

232
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,587
why you had to do the things you did.

233
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,300
Please put me in charge
of the second Mujin resort project.

234
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:04,054
I'll do everything I can
to make the project a success.

235
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:13,355
Now that you're becoming a father,
you finally sound like an adult.

236
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,027
I will raise my child right…

237
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,738
with the best that life has to offer.

238
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:26,952
That's my number one priority.
I won't look back again.

239
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,790
The past is behind me now.

240
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:23,925
J.S. BACH: FAMOUS SOLO WORKS

242
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,690
He's my favorite composer.

243
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,235
I bet you'll be into his music soon.

244
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,571
Classical music puts me to sleep.

245
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:49,284
You said my movies and books were boring,
but you finished them anyway.

246
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:50,952
Well, that was…

247
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,955
because you liked them.

248
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,167
Things that are special to you…

249
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,837
are special to me too.

Are you craving anything?

MY HONEY

255
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,687
-There you go.
-Thank you.

POWER OFF

259
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,541
I'll take you to the changing room.

260
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:22,604
-Prep the anesthetics, please.
-Sure.

261
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,326
"During pregnancy…"

262
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:45,543
Sir.

263
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,155
It's not true, is it?

264
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,160
Mr. Gong is mistaken, right?

265
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,956
Did you abort it?

266
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,882
How could you do this?

267
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:35,760
How?

268
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,180
Without even telling me, how…

269
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:42,183
How could you? It was our baby.

270
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,561
How could you do this?

271
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:48,189
No.

272
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,276
I didn't do it.

273
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,168
Get up.

274
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,046
Let's talk at home.

275
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,800
Thank you. Thank you so much.

276
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,053
Seriously, thank you.

277
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:26,978
The ultrasound. Can I see it?

278
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,835
When I was driving there earlier,

279
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,007
I didn't feel alive.

280
00:27:57,675 --> 00:28:00,011
It felt like I had disappeared too.

281
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:06,393
Have you made up your mind?
To keep the baby?

282
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,479
I've never told you…

283
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,607
about my mom, have I?

284
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,236
After my dad passed,

285
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:20,782
I hated the feeling
of being left all alone.

286
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:22,826
I was really lonely.

287
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,661
So I went to see my mom in Australia.

288
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,956
She left us before I learned to walk.

289
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,959
I'd promised myself
never to look for her first.

290
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,379
But she's my mom, you know.

291
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,549
I hoped she'd comfort me.

292
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:41,469
I took a ten-hour flight to get there.

293
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,930
When I told her that Dad had passed away,

294
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:47,183
she said, "We're all alone in this life."

295
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:53,898
She was remarried with three kids.

296
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,025
"All alone." Really?

297
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:03,450
Mom means nothing to me.

298
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:06,286
And I never I wanted kids.

299
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:08,788
Besides…

300
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:13,209
I had made up my mind
to divorce you and get an abortion.

301
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,546
But the question gnawed at me.

302
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:19,466
"Are we really all alone in life?"

303
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,555
I, more than anyone,
didn't want to end up alone.

304
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,936
I didn't want to regret it,
so I changed my mind.

305
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:36,065
But keeping the baby is separate
from my decision to end things with you.

306
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,442
All right.

307
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:40,904
I get it.

308
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:43,740
But at least until we register the birth,

309
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:45,950
let's put off the paperwork.

310
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,579
I don't want the baby
to be born without a dad.

311
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:52,874
That's all I ask for.

312
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,918
I won't demand or force anything else.

313
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:57,587
I'll just wait.

314
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:06,846
DETECTIVE KIM TAE-HEON

315
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,996
The person you have called is unavailable.
Please leave--

316
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:36,626
She must be wondering
if I found anything in Mueon.

317
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:37,919
Why can't I reach her?

318
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,134
SEOL WOO-JAE

319
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,182
-Hello?
-It's me.

320
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,976
I'm at the precinct's rear entrance.

321
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,519
Let's meet up.

322
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,740
Are you going to punch me
like you did last time?

323
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,831
I know what you're about to say.

324
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,333
I can't do it.

325
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,295
Jeong-won asked you for a divorce,

326
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:23,798
and she's living with Ms. Yang now.

327
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:25,717
I know all that.

328
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,261
I'll wait…

329
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,599
for Jeong-won to sort this out
and feel free again.

330
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:38,897
You no longer have the right…
to lecture me.

331
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:40,982
I'm not here to lecture you.

332
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:43,318
I'm here to plead.

333
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:47,071
Jeong-won's been avoiding you, hasn't she?

334
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,575
I was with her earlier,

335
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:52,076
and she ignored your call.

336
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,329
Jeong-won…

337
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,916
She's changed. Have you noticed?

338
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,585
She's pregnant.

339
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,716
She was very confused for a while,
but she decided to keep it.

340
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,052
We've also decided
to postpone the divorce.

341
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,347
It's still early days. She needs to rest.

342
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:17,018
I don't want her to go
through any pain or hardship.

343
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:23,107
So I want you to set her free first.

344
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:27,362
Help make this easier for her.

345
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:18,371
I don't know how long it'll take.

346
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:21,833
But… will you wait for me?

347
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,434
DETECTIVE KIM TAE-HEON

348
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,156
DETECTIVE KIM TAE-HEON

349
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,119
-Hi.
-Where are you?

350
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,080
I'm on the way to Ae-na's. What about you?

351
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:04,083
I'm where you asked me to wait for you.

352
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:20,224
I love you.

353
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:25,813
I might never be able to say this again.

354
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:30,526
I love you.

355
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,947
Eventually, you'll end things with him.

356
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,034
Our feelings for each other still remain.

357
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,996
I can do better. I can handle it all.

358
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,749
So don't push me away again.

359
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:47,877
My feelings…

360
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,923
They haven't disappeared.

361
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:54,592
They've changed.

362
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,847
Ever since I realized I was pregnant,

363
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:04,018
I've felt things I'd never felt before.

364
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,355
I can't put them in words.

365
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:13,236
To me, these feelings come first.

366
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:16,030
But it doesn't have to affect
our relationship.

367
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,241
Our relationship must change, and it will.

368
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,158
Why?

369
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:22,245
Could you ignore a woman with your child

370
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,914
and date me like nothing's wrong?

371
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:25,915
Could you do that?

372
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,417
That's completely different.

373
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:29,627
It's the same to me.

374
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:40,138
What am I supposed to do now?
Where does that leave me?

375
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,516
I can wait for as long as it takes.

376
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:46,978
I want to wait.

377
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:50,815
I can do that, can't I?

378
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,153
What I said to you here…

379
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:57,864
Forget everything.

380
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,159
Make it…

381
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:03,953
less hard for me.

382
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,292
Let's not talk for a while.

383
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,502
I love you.

384
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:37,755
I might never be able to say this again.

385
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,716
I love you.

386
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,387
What am I supposed to do now?

387
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:46,389
Where does that leave me?

388
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,767
I can wait for as long as it takes.

389
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,104
I want to wait.

390
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,108
I can do that, can't I?

391
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,470
You went to bed early.

392
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:28,764
I can't sleep.

393
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:39,275
I'd be surprised if you didn't cry.

394
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,988
Poor Detective Kim.

395
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:48,200
I feel so sorry for you guys.

396
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:50,786
I guess you two…

397
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,622
aren't meant to be.

398
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:03,067
Hey.

399
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:07,780
Here.

400
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,203
Come to think of it,

401
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:17,832
you were the one
who taught me how to drink.

402
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,176
Remember what you told me?

403
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:32,513
That detectives must look cool
even when they're drunk.

404
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:37,351
That instead of letting others
see me at my lowest point,

405
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,394
I should call you.

406
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:52,158
You know, don't you?

407
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:57,705
Did you cry?

408
00:40:58,539 --> 00:40:59,915
I did more than that.

409
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,714
I wept buckets.

410
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:10,092
Like a little kid.

411
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,975
There were only two other times…

412
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:24,440
I couldn't control my tears
when I thought I was doing well.

413
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,818
When my mom passed away.

414
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:32,198
When Detective Cha died.

415
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,992
When I broke up with Jeong-won.

416
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:38,913
This is the third time now.

417
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,631
I'm a widower, so I wouldn't know.

418
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:52,968
But from what I've heard,
having children in marriage

419
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,595
makes a world of difference.

420
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,849
Tae-heon, clinging to a lost cause…

421
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,060
is the most foolish act.

422
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:14,031
Thank you.

423
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:16,075
He is the real thing

424
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:18,827
He's the total package

425
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:23,040
He'll love you deeply

426
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:24,458
Number three!

427
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,126
NEW GANGWON-DO

428
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,170
Respected residents of Gangwon-do.

429
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:32,007
When I told the truth about everything

430
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,592
and kneeled before the public,

431
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:37,763
all of you helped me get back on my feet.

432
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:39,723
You saved me!

433
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:45,854
I got back on my feet again
for our country and people,

434
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,607
but everyone,
including my fellow party members,

435
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:51,944
is stabbing me in my heart
by asking me to step down.

436
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:55,614
Do I really need to step down?

437
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:58,325
-No!
-No! Don't step down.

438
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:01,954
I've already come back from the dead!

439
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:05,416
I will fight to the very end and prevail!

440
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:12,339
Mo Hyeong-taek! Mo Hyeong-taek!

441
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,843
-Hello.
-We love you.

442
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:21,473
Mo Hyeong-taek! Mo Hyeong-taek!

00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:24,018

00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:27,271
NUMBER 3
MO HYEONG-TAEK

445
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:32,818
Did you find an alternative site
for Mujin's second resort?

446
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:35,070
Increasing four levels in one go
is too risky.

447
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:36,697
You'll be charged with malpractice.

448
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,073
You think I don't know that?

449
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:41,285
Chairman Seol is cornering me
when it's too risky,

450
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:43,996
which means he can't run his business
if it's below Level Four.

451
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:51,253
Is Soo-rin still insisting
on talking only to Detective Kim?

452
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:52,171
Yes.

453
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:54,089
By the way, sir,

454
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:56,925
unexpected information surfaced
in the last investigation report.

455
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:01,639
About Lee Na-ri, the target
of the fire at the Bongto Factory.

456
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:06,268
Ms. Mo made a statement that
she saw her running out of the factory.

457
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:07,728
What the heck?

458
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,942
Right.

459
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:17,905
There was one body with unverified DNA.

460
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:21,659
Detective Kim went to Mueon later
and contacted Detective Bong.

461
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:24,328
It seems like he's got a lead.

462
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:30,751
Cancel the rest of my schedule.

463
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:33,837
Call Detective Bong. Tell him I'm coming.

EMERGENCY CALL RECORDING

465
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:37,925
I see. This must be it.

466
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:41,178
The truck rollover accident you mentioned.

467
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:43,764
A firefighter called it in.
It was blocking the road--

468
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:50,270
Come here.

469
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,358
Did you get something?

470
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,861
Emergency services. Go ahead.

471
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:03,575
My friend is hurt.

472
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:05,035
Where did they get injured?

473
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,579
Well, she passed out.

474
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,873
She passed out? Is she conscious now?

475
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:13,252
-I'm not sure.
-Can you tell me how it happened?

476
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,379
It was an accident.

477
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,924
Hello? Where are you?

478
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:24,430
We're near the Bongto Factory.

479
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:28,684
There was a big fire incident,
so it'll take a while to send help.

480
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:34,231
-Something feels off, doesn't it?
-Absolutely.

481
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,776
He said his friend was hurt,
but something feels…

482
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,779
More importantly, he said
he was around the Bongto Factory.

483
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,031
Check who this number belongs to.

EMERGENCY CALL RECORDING

485
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:22,154
CHAIRMAN SEOL PAN-HO

486
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:42,174
I thought you had gone to Seoul.
But I heard you canceled your schedule.

487
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:47,346
Did you come down here to see me?

488
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:49,640
I wanted to watch you campaigning

489
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:52,059
and inspect my subsidiaries
while I was at it.

490
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:57,481
Seeing how you're joking around,
you must have received some good news.

491
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:00,776
I'm going to be a grandfather.

492
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:04,404
He turned down
so many eligible bachelorettes

493
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,073
and insisted on marrying Jeong-won.

494
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:09,326
I wanted grandchildren,
so I let him marry her. And now?

495
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:12,621
He's fulfilling his duty as my son.

496
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:17,167
Was that all?

497
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:21,964
The reason you accepted Ms. Seo
as your daughter-in-law?

498
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:25,175
I thought Reporter Seo Sang-gyeon
had a hand in it.

499
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:29,638
Since we're talking about the past…

500
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:31,807
My daughter made another mistake.

501
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:38,522
She set the Bongto Factory on fire

502
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:42,150
to kill one of the female students.

503
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:46,280
But she managed to escape
from the factory.

504
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,408
Here's the interesting part.

505
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:53,745
The body found at the factory
that supposedly belonged to the student

506
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:57,541
was too damaged for DNA verification.

507
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:01,503
Where do you suppose the student could be

508
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:03,505
right now?

509
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:07,134
Is it something I should be aware of?

510
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:13,265
Well, maybe. Maybe not.

511
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:18,812
Detective Kim Tae-heon, of all people,

512
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:22,190
got his hands on a recording
of an emergency call from that day.

513
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:26,820
I managed to get the file
and listen to it.

514
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:29,281
Would you like to listen to it too?

515
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:33,035
You'll hear a voice
you can easily recognize.

516
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:44,546
If you need the recording,
just let me know.

517
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:47,424
And the next time you want to see me,

518
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,177
I suggest you make an appointment
in advance.

519
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,274
DECEMBER 24, 2009

520
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:07,819
What? The fire trucks can't even budge?

521
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:12,574
What can they do?
The roads are heavily congested now.

522
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:15,327
Tell me as soon as things are sorted out
at the scene.

523
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:16,244
All right.

524
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:18,997
Let's see.

525
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:23,585
It's already well past the golden hour.

526
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,879
Even if they flew there now,

527
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:29,132
there's no way
they could contain the fire.

528
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:34,096
It must've collapsed by now,
only leaving some rebar standing.

529
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:37,808
My goodness. You tried so hard
to get rid of them but couldn't.

530
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:41,478
Who knew the factory would burn in a fire?

531
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:44,815
And the fire trucks can't even move?
What timing!

532
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:47,192
Oh, my gosh.

533
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:49,820
The morning prayers surely paid off.

534
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:55,492
Why are you all quiet?
Is something the matter?

535
00:49:58,328 --> 00:49:59,788
No, sir, you're right.

536
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,874
You're no fun today. This is boring.

537
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:06,670
Right.

538
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:09,965
Your golf bag. It's in your car, right?

539
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:14,302
-My iron.
-I'll drop it off for you later.

540
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:18,515
Because of other things,
I can't get the golf bag out now.

541
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:13,111
Chairman Seol, that idiot.
He couldn't say a word.

542
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:17,365
Well, how should I use this?

543
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:26,792
If this man is Woo-jae,
it means he killed Dad too.

544
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:31,129
But it makes no sense.

545
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:33,131
Why would Woo-jae kill Dad?

546
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:37,594
Where do we go for our vacation this year?

547
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:39,971
A YEAR AGO

548
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:42,974
I'm easy.
Let's go to a place where you want to go.

549
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:47,229
How about New York?

550
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:52,776
I'm fine with anywhere but New York.

551
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,444
Why?

552
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:58,406
Because you studied there?

553
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:06,456
The whole time I was there,
I was lonely and depressed.

554
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:10,919
When did you leave?

555
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:13,588
February 2010.

556
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:15,757
My dad…

557
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,260
passed away in January.

558
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:21,638
When we were 20,

559
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:23,807
we were both lonely and depressed.

560
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:34,526
Dad passed away in January 2010,

561
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:37,696
and Woo-jae left for New York
in February of that year.

562
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:41,700
So I must check Woo-jae's alibi
on the day my dad died.

563
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:55,046
Isn't it all over now?

564
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:57,173
Why are you here?

565
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,552
I will not apologize.

566
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:05,640
Don't look at me like that.

567
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:09,436
Yun-yeong's gone, and I'm locked up here.

568
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:12,522
Had you not run away,

569
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:14,566
Yun-yeong's plan would have failed.

570
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:16,443
You brought it upon yourself.

571
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:20,280
Yes, that I admit.

572
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:25,368
I'm here because
something more important happened.

573
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:29,122
My husband.

574
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:32,709
In February 2010,
he left for his studies in the US.

575
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:33,877
You know that, right?

576
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:36,254
Yes.

577
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:40,508
Do you happen to know what he was up to
in the month leading to his departure?

578
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,261
Because of Na-ri's death,

579
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:45,722
he was probably devastated.

580
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:47,807
Woo-jae and I were never close.

581
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:50,101
Anything connected to Yoo Yun-yeong?

582
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:51,770
Is there anything you remember?

583
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:03,406
I'll have to go through my diary.
I wouldn't remember otherwise.

584
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:12,123
Hey, it's me. Can you do me a favor?

585
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:15,335
Mo Soo-rin's diary
is in the evidence room, right?

586
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:16,252
Yes.

587
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:20,048
Can you go through
the diary entries from January

588
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:23,093
and see if any of them mention
Yoo Yun-yeong and my husband together?

589
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,221
This is very important to me.

590
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:29,099
Well… All right.

591
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:32,560
If you find anything,
take a picture and send it to me.

592
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,105
Is Tae-heon there too?

593
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:37,774
Yes.

594
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:40,860
This has to stay between us.
Please don't tell him.

595
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:48,868
-What was that about?
-What?

596
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:51,538
Nothing important.

597
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:56,334
MYEONSEONG UNIVERSITY
MUEON ANSIM HOSPITAL

598
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:03,758
Hi, I'm Detective Kim Tae-heon
from the Gangha precinct.

599
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:05,719
I'm calling to check

600
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:08,596
if the body of an unidentified
19-year-old girl

601
00:55:09,305 --> 00:55:13,601
was transported there in the afternoon
or later on December 24, 2009.

602
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,837
-Hey.
-I found something.

603
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:44,299
It says Yoo visited a hospital in Seoul
to see your husband.

604
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:46,342
Woo-jae was in Seoul?

605
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:49,512
What's the date in that entry?

606
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:50,638
January 10th.

607
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:54,934
-Can you send me a picture?
-Sure.

608
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:06,362
Yun-yeong canceled on me
to visit Woo-jae at the hospital in Seoul.

609
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:27,967
Dad. What brings you here?

610
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:35,600
Do you know
why the Lord puts us through ordeals?

611
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:40,271
To turn us from wrongdoing

612
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:42,524
and keep us from pride and arrogance.

613
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:48,947
I'm becoming a grandfather,

614
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:51,866
and my son is volunteering
to help me run the business.

615
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:53,451
So I guess I've become arrogant.

616
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:03,044
The emergency call records from that day.

617
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:04,879
Detective Kim Tae-heon took them.

618
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:07,757
-Sorry?
-I'm talking about…

619
00:57:08,633 --> 00:57:10,969
December 24, 2009.

620
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:07,562
I would've done something
if I wasn't so drunk that day.

621
01:00:07,645 --> 01:00:09,272
Tae-heon, give up.

622
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:11,941
For Reporter Seo
and for your own sake too.

623
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,318
I'm becoming a mother.

624
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:15,903
For my child, I must find out

625
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:17,905
whether or not Woo-jae is a murderer.

626
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:20,325
On Christmas Eve 2009,

627
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:23,620
I found a headlight shard
with blood on it.

628
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:25,455
Did something happen here on January 10th?

629
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:28,082
A concert
for the Bongto Factory fire victims.

630
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:30,418
Why? Why was it kept hidden?

631
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:32,795
If it's a murder,
the body is very important.

632
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:35,131
We must find Lee Na-ri's body
no matter what.

633
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:37,091
Jeong-won, what are you doing in Mueon?

634
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:40,345
Did you see the news?
Skeletal remains were found on Mueonsan.

635
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:42,138
It's Lee Na-ri.
