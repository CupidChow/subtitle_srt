1
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:48,423
LOCATIONS, PEOPLE, ORGANIZATIONS,
INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,123
Yes.

3
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,712
-Hello?
-This evening,

4
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,590
the Management Awards Ceremony
will be held.

5
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:33,092
And Mujin Group
will receive the Grand Award.

6
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,177
So?

7
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,346
I'll receive it on behalf of the company,

8
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,182
and I'd like you to be there.

9
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,183
Me? Why?

10
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,477
I want you to listen
to my acceptance speech.

11
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:52,695
THE 20TH MANAGEMENT AWARDS

12
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,701
I am

13
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:00,995
a murderer.

14
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,670
On December 24, 2009,

15
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,382
I caused a hit-and-run and killed someone.

16
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:19,889
MUJIN GROUP

17
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,432
Then

18
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,269
my father

19
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,855
buried the body in Mueonsan.

20
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,870
Am I wrong, Father?

21
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,794
DAWN OF DECEMBER 25, 2009

22
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,961
When did you start following me?

23
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:34,839
Please,

24
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,884
don't do this.

25
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,428
You shouldn't do this.

26
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,473
Leave before someone sees you.

27
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,475
-Father!
-Now.

28
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,777
A few days ago,

29
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,987
you must've seen on the news

30
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,574
that a man's body and a female skeleton
were found in Mueonsan.

31
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,742
How did you feel?

32
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,330
You buried that body there, Father.

33
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,586
You and I are the only ones
who know the truth about that day,

34
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,296
so tell the truth yourself.

35
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,137
Who buried the body? Was it me?

36
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,390
Or was it you?

37
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,395
What you did that day led to

38
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,231
even bigger crimes.

39
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,694
It kept on spreading like poison,

40
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,280
Father.

41
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,396
-Is it true?
-Did you really bury the body?

42
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,314
Is it true?

43
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,065
-The skeleton found…
-Please respond.

44
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,693
-Is it true that you buried it?
-Is it true?

45
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:21,029
Is everything your son said really true?

46
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,531
-Do you admit it?
-Was he telling the truth?

47
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:24,532
Is it true?

48
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,534
Is it true? Just a comment, sir.

49
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,202
Do you admit it?

50
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:42,050
My father and I
committed the crime in 2009,

51
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,595
and I've only decided
to reveal it in 2024.

52
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,349
I sincerely apologize.

53
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,144
I am sorry.

54
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:36,729
Mr. Seol Woo-jae,

55
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:41,526
you're under arrest for violating
the Act on Traffic Accidents.

56
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,780
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say

57
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,658
can and will be used against you
in a court of law.

58
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,910
You also have the right to an attorney.

59
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,668
-There he is!
-He's coming out!

60
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,753
-He's here.
-Get him on camera!

61
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,089
Please step back.

62
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,549
Step aside, please.

63
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,759
-Say a few words.
-Just a comment!

64
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,953
Has Jeong-won found out everything?

65
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,707
Is that why you turned yourself in?

66
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,335
I've lied to you this whole time.

67
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,171
Would you believe anything I say?

68
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:27,965
Do you trust me?

69
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,550
Should I trust you?

70
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,931
Don't you regret turning yourself in?

71
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,104
I do regret it.

72
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:45,942
Then I can trust you.

73
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,244
Are you sure
you don't need an attorney present?

74
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,291
What you did is one thing,

75
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,002
but why did you reveal
what your father did as well?

76
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,881
For his sake, you could've concealed
that he buried the body.

77
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,842
That day…

78
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,973
had he not covered up what I did,

79
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,810
and had he taken me to the police
and let me get punished,

80
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,898
things wouldn't have gotten
this messed up.

81
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,611
No matter how horrible,
he is still my father,

82
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,114
so I can't let him go farther.

83
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:36,409
Once I became convinced
that you were the hit-and-run driver,

84
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,286
I investigated your past.

85
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:41,998
Before you moved to the US at age 20,
you were admitted against your will

86
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,375
to a large psychiatric facility.

87
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,964
Chairman Seol will use
your mental health records

88
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,509
and drug use
to render your statement inadmissible.

89
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:57,305
With a statement alone,
you're at a great disadvantage.

90
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,142
Regarding my hit-and-run offense,

91
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,519
there is one piece of evidence.

92
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,564
TWO DAYS AGO

93
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,956
It's a shard of the headlight
from the car I drove that night.

94
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:10,544
I don't know
why my father kept it this long,

95
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,631
but I took it in case it connected to me.

96
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,591
So if what you say is true,

97
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:19,220
we'll find Chairman Seol's prints
on this plastic bag,

98
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:22,890
and if we compare the blood on the glass
with Lee Na-ri's DNA--

99
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:23,974
It'll confirm

100
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,394
it's Na-ri's blood.

101
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:34,193
I want to bring your father in for a chat,
but I'm not sure if it's possible

102
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:36,779
considering who he is.

103
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,616
It'll be a tough fight,
and we're at a disadvantage.

104
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,036
But let's do it.

105
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,122
It will take a long time,

106
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,331
but still.

107
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,544
In the end, you'll win.

108
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:54,922
The truth is on your side.

109
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,481
MUJIN GROUP HEIR SEOL CONFESSES TO MURDER

110
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,988
If both father and son take a hit,

111
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,950
what happens to Mujin Group?

112
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:25,786
What about my profit?

113
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:36,380
What on earth is going on?
I even gave you the evidence.

114
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,258
What happens to the second resort?

115
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:43,846
Your son confessed in public
so there's no covering it up.

116
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,725
You'll make Woo-jae take the fall, right?

117
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,520
You want me to shove my son off a cliff
like you did?

118
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,315
Why would you bring that up right now?

119
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,484
The evidence you gave me is gone.

120
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,320
-What?
-I think Woo-jae took it.

121
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:02,907
Not only will the DNA come up,
but they'll find our prints as well.

122
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:03,991
Wait.

123
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,704
I had nothing to do
with that girl's death.

124
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:11,582
A detective will come
to ask why they found your prints

125
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:14,502
on evidence related to a case
you had nothing to do with.

126
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:15,753
And then,

127
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,964
-they'll look into our relationship.
-What?

128
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,429
The top-secret documents you kept at home,

129
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,264
you moved them all.

130
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,018
Admit that you had my dad killed.

131
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,980
Apologize for having my dad

132
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,191
killed.

133
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,696
How dare you use my son?

134
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,990
I helped Woo-jae

135
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:49,286
to escape the torment
of having to hide his crime forever.

136
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,624
Even if you don't admit it
or apologize to me,

137
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,751
in the end,

138
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,546
Father, you will crumble.

139
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,340
I will make it happen.

140
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,561
MOST POPULAR NEWS

141
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,854
NA PIL-SEUNG DRUG CHARGE,
DROPPED FROM DRAMA

142
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,086
I think Chairman Seol
is manipulating the media.

143
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,171
I saw it too.

144
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,099
It's a video of Woo-jae
hitting Na-ri and driving off.

145
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:57,104
If I apply for an arrest warrant
based on this,

146
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,814
I'll get it right away.

147
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:03,611
I became a woman
who sent her own husband to prison.

148
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:07,489
Aren't I scary?

149
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,366
The real scary person

150
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,701
is your father-in-law.

151
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,871
You've come this far fighting against him.

152
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,999
That's not scary. That's admirable.

153
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,630
-I should go.
-Jeong-won.

154
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,468
Woo-jae has something
to tell you in person.

155
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,002
I'm relieved.

156
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:05,839
If you didn't care about me
being locked up in here,

157
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,217
I'd have felt hurt.

158
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:16,725
Jeong-won,

159
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,478
I have a favor to ask.

160
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,481
And I really want you to do me this favor.

161
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,237
The video of my hit-and-run

162
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,572
that your father took,

163
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,409
play it on TV.

164
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,996
Say the late Seo Sang-gyeon took it

165
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,330
and that video

166
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,624
got him killed.

167
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,253
And that Chairman Seol Pan-ho did it.

168
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:49,383
The fact that your father-in-law
killed your father,

169
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,803
report it as an exclusive.

170
00:16:56,223 --> 00:17:00,185
Use the broadcast to get everyone
to focus on my father and me.

171
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,520
That's the only way

172
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,815
to force a crack
in my father's stronghold.

173
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:12,406
I already resigned,
and my show was cancelled.

174
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:15,784
There's no law against
a former reporter appearing on TV.

175
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:23,083
I gave an audio recording of my father
you can play on the air to Detective Kim.

176
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:38,265
Jeong-won, it's okay to do it.

177
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:41,810
You must do it.

178
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,946
Seol Pan-ho's voice recording.

179
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,699
It's not just this.

180
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,328
A piece of the broken headlight
Chairman Seol had kept hidden,

181
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,039
Woo-jae had taken and hid it.

182
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,709
If it's a piece of the headlight,
the blood--

183
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,252
We're having it tested

184
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:11,548
to find out whether it's Lee Na-ri's
and if Seol's prints are on it.

185
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,801
I'll tell you once we get the results.

186
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,511
Thanks.

187
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,811
You once asked me something.

188
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,314
What I think when I catch a culprit.

189
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:30,526
Do you remember what I said?

190
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,611
You said that you don't think.

191
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:34,822
That you just catch them.

192
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,573
Don't think about anything else.

193
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,743
Just do what you need to do.

194
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:42,955
Only you can do it.

195
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,301
RECORDING 001

196
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:12,526
SEOL WOO-JAE ARRESTED
FOR HIT-AND-RUN MURDER

197
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,611
SEOL WAS ARRESTED LAST NIGHT AT…

198
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:21,493
SEO JEONG-WON WOULD'VE COVERED THIS
IF HER PROGRAM WERE STILL ON

199
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,126
CHIEF KANG IN-HAN

200
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,425
Chief, I need to talk to you right now.

201
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,553
My gosh. This is…

202
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,514
-What is this?
-Gosh.

203
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,353
-Your dad took this video?
-Yes.

204
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,689
What kind of twisted fate is this?

205
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,567
How did things get so complicated?

206
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,486
Will you really play this on TV?

207
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,280
There's one more thing to play.

208
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,157
What is it?

209
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,285
Secretary Gong was arrested.

210
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,536
It's for the best.

211
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:08,957
Your wife is on her way home
after watching his interrogation.

212
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,459
Console her.

213
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,877
As I console Jeong-won,

214
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:15,130
should I say
Secretary Gong didn't kill her father

215
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,132
and that it was you?

216
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,885
What would you gain from that?

217
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,600
Your father-in-law was asked point-blank
if he killed your dad,

218
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:27,893
and he didn't deny it.

219
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,103
My husband will be arraigned today.

220
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,981
We must release this before that
to make it really explode.

221
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,483
But, Ms. Seo,

222
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,361
if you, the chairman's daughter-in-law,
release these,

223
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,946
it'll cause a huge ruckus.

224
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,197
Are you okay with that?

225
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,242
Yes. You're attacking your husband
and his father.

226
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:46,370
Would our society accept that?

227
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,372
Can you handle the aftermath?

228
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:51,124
It could hit you badly.
Are you sure about this?

229
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,751
I won't think about anything else.

230
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,170
I'll just do what I must.

231
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,966
If we don't put you on air,
you'll stream on your own?

232
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,092
Yes.

233
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:06,098
Why don't we use the media?

234
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,601
Tae-heon!

235
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,436
We just got the results.

236
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,522
Lee Na-ri's blood was on the glass,

237
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,608
and it's from the exact model car
Seol owned back then.

238
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:23,615
Today, I plan to explain
the story behind Board Chairman

239
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,284
Seol Woo-jae's announcement.

240
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:29,830
Please show your support
so that Nothing Uncovered

241
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,499
can air a special broadcast.

242
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,418
Look at the response.

243
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,587
ONLY NOTHING CAN COVER THIS.

244
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,006
UNCOVER IT FOR US, JEONG-WON!

245
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,176
The views and number of comments
are climbing like crazy.

246
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,262
They're asking what time we go live.

247
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,056
What now?

248
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,475
Should I go to the CEO myself?

249
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,771
Follow me.

250
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:55,981
-Let's go.
-Yes, let's.

251
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,697
Take care of it so there's no problem.

252
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,285
KBM CEO KIM WON-HO

253
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,621
THE TRUTH BEHIND SEOL WOO-JAE'S ARREST

254
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:21,465
CEO'S OFFICE

255
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:26,928
They've been in there for so long.
Why aren't they done yet?

256
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,306
Are you praying?

257
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,266
Will you be quiet? Please!

258
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:33,685
-Please…
-I think that's it. They're here.

259
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,400
-Is it a no?
-Our old time slot.

260
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:43,570
A special broadcast.

261
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,325
-Great.
-Let's go.

262
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,293
What you hear tonight will shock you.

263
00:22:58,376 --> 00:22:59,669
-Do your best.
-Really?

264
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:00,921
Yes. What's she taking her?

265
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,760
NOTHING UNCOVERED

266
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,303
-Jeong-won.
-Yes.

267
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:09,846
The material. Go through it.

268
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:10,931
Thanks.

269
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,038
Hello.

270
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:38,291
This is a Nothing Uncovered special.

271
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,543
I'm Seo Jeong-won.

272
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,420
At the Management Awards ceremony,

273
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:45,090
Mujin Welfare Foundation's
board chairman Seol Woo-jae

274
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:48,552
confessed to a hit-and-run murder
on December 24, 2009.

275
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:53,640
He also said his father
buried the body in Mueonsan.

276
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:57,018
I'll play a video of the accident
that supports this.

277
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,895
The person you're trying to reach…

278
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:11,116
What's interesting is that someone else
confessed to the hit-and-run.

279
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,828
That person is Gong,
Chairman Seol Pan-ho's secretary

280
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:17,372
who is currently in lockup.

281
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:19,583
Gong has another charge against him.

282
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:23,753
He stated he also killed my father,
Reporter Seo Sang-gyeon.

283
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,047
Here's a related recording.

284
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:30,719
Secretary Gong was arrested.

285
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,762
It's for the best.

286
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:37,142
Your wife is on the way home
after watching his interrogation.

287
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,643
Console her.

288
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,228
As I console Jeong-won,

289
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,315
should I say
Secretary Gong didn't kill her father

290
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:45,317
and that it was you?

291
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,653
What would you gain from that?

292
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,158
That statement was also a lie.

293
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:57,412
So we can't say Chairman Seol
is disconnected

294
00:24:57,495 --> 00:25:00,832
to the hit-and-run
or Seo Sang-gyeon's murder.

295
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:06,588
This is a piece of the headlight
from the car

296
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:10,133
Seol Woo-jae committed
the hit-and-run with on December 24, 2009.

297
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,261
The blood was confirmed
to be the victim's,

298
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,846
and it's from the exact model

299
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:19,100
that Chairman Seol owned back in 2009.

300
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,404
Mr. Seol,

301
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,199
your arrest warrant

302
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,076
was issued.

303
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,463
My team

304
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,341
used the adage that the search for truth

305
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:55,595
starts with doubting
what we believe to be true

306
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,139
as a compass to come this far.

307
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:00,267
We stop here,

308
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,728
but we ask the public to watch and check

309
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:07,482
if the investigation
is carried out impartially.

310
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,713
Seol Woo-jae has been arrested.

311
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,428
Arrest Seol Pan-ho!

312
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,346
Arrest him! Arrest him!

313
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,306
Reopen the case…

314
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:40,765
-He's here.
-That's him.

315
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:44,060
Arrest Seol Pan-ho!

316
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,812
Arrest him! Arrest him!

317
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:47,480
Reopen the case and investigate.

318
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,232
Investigate! Investigate!

319
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,984
Arrest Seol Pan-ho!

320
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,569
Arrest him! Arrest him!

321
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:54,195
Reopen the case and investigate.

322
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,530
Investigate! Investigate!

323
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,130
GANGWON STATE GOVERNMENT

324
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:15,967
CHAIRMAN SEOL COMES FOR QUESTIONING

325
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,844
The tiger came in voluntarily.

326
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,431
I wonder where the serpent is.

327
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,289
Governor Mo Hyeong-taek,

328
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:51,169
did you read that Chairman Seol
went in for questioning?

329
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,506
Why would you ask me that?

330
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:58,385
The headlight shard,
a piece of evidence in Lee Na-ri's death,

331
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,929
your prints were on it too, right?

332
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:01,930
Step aside.

333
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:07,060
When the Bongto plant was on fire,
a truck accident blocked the entryway.

334
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:08,978
How much about that did you know?

335
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:13,316
You were a prosecutor in Mueon
at the time.

336
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,194
I heard someone gave a tip-off

337
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:19,489
that you fabricated
the truck accident case report.

338
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:24,202
That accident delayed first responders,
and all the victims died.

339
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:28,540
If you actually covered that up,
you must suffer the consequences.

340
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:51,271
MO'S FORMER STAFFER CONFESSES
"HE MANIPULATED INVESTIGATION RECORDS"

341
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,029
What are you looking at?

342
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,868
Why are you staring at me?

343
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:46,159
Father voluntarily went to the police
in the morning.

344
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:51,915
And about the truck accident that day,

345
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:56,544
Governor Mo Hyeong-taek manipulated
the investigation records.

346
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,839
His staffer at the time disclosed it.

347
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,136
-That means…
-Father planned everything,

348
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,264
and Mo Hyeong-taek acted as his shield

349
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:11,684
to ensure the success
of the resort development project.

350
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,186
So the two of them

351
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,356
shared many ugly secrets too.

352
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:22,695
I found a place.

353
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,573
I'm moving in tomorrow.

354
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:27,408
I'm happy for you.

355
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,166
In my dream,

356
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:39,295
I saw a bird.

357
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,467
It couldn't fly
because of its broken wings.

358
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:48,137
But then, I guess they healed.
The bird suddenly…

359
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,432
spread its wings

360
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:54,143
and flew away.

361
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:59,107
When I woke up from the dream,
I realized that the bird I saw…

362
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:02,819
was you.

363
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,615
I wanted to keep you by my side
no matter what,

364
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,577
so I broke

365
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,622
your wings.

366
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,383
Jeong-won,

367
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:29,470
on the desk in the study, you'll find

368
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,639
the divorce papers.

369
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,726
Go ahead and submit them.

370
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,940
But just know this.

371
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,694
After that incident happened,

372
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:48,072
I couldn't live as myself

373
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:51,242
or as someone else. I felt like

374
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,912
everything was fake.

375
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,249
The only real thing in my life

376
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:01,753
was you.

377
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,136
I should have never met you.

378
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:12,722
Now,

379
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:15,558
the miserable memories we share

380
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:17,936
certainly outnumber

381
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:20,939
our happy memories.

382
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,244
I hope

383
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,373
you can stop regretting meeting me.

384
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:40,792
Forget everything

385
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,461
and be free.

386
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:46,714
I wish you all the best.

387
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,484
I no longer regret it.

388
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,701
While living together,

389
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,537
we had our happy moments too.

390
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,541
Before I met you, I was all alone,

391
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,794
and it was nice to have a family.

392
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,131
Also,

393
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,469
you gave me this gift,

394
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,346
our child.

395
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:45,064
Even if you're no longer my husband,

396
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,861
you'll still be the father of our child,
that will never change.

397
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:53,948
Once the baby is born,

398
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,451
I'll visit to show you.

399
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:35,615
APPLICATION FOR CONFIRMATION
OF DIVORCE BY CONSENT

400
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:27,250
DETECTIVE KIM TAE-HEON

401
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:54,318
Hey, Tae-heon,

402
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:57,446
I want to go on a date with you.

403
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:00,616
Can we meet now?

404
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,913
-Now?
-Why? Do you have plans?

405
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:08,666
No.

406
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:10,960
I'm relieved.

407
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:13,671
I'll text you the address.

408
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:14,797
All right.

409
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,679
The night breeze feels nice.

410
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,100
It's nice to walk with you like this.

411
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:09,769
I like this.

412
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,408
Staring at the fire with you,

413
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,994
I like this.

414
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:31,123
Do you know

415
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:34,085
how many times you've said it today?

416
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,963
I'm going to say it once more.

417
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:39,799
I like

418
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,094
Kim Tae-heon

419
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:45,972
a lot.

420
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,654
You helped me recharge like this.

421
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,992
You told me to stay strong.

422
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:08,911
I said to myself

423
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:10,746
that you gave me

424
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:13,749
more strength than anything.

425
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:18,671
When things got rough,

426
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:22,091
do you know what the worst part was?

427
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:25,094
It was that I couldn't see the end.

428
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:29,724
That drives you crazy the most.

429
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,185
But fortunately,

430
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,313
finally,

431
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,441
I can see the end.

432
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,861
-Jeong-won.
-I can end my misery

433
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,197
by ending things with you on good terms.

434
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:50,828
Tomorrow,

435
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:53,456
I leave Seoul.

436
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,624
To be precise,

437
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,211
I'm leaving you.

438
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,720
I should've said I had plans.

439
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,600
I shouldn't have come on this date.

440
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,729
Then I'd have left

441
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,483
without getting to say goodbye.

442
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,082
Considering my situation,

443
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,085
coming back to you

444
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,087
is just wrong.

445
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,671
You don't have to come to me.

446
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:47,009
I won't ask to date you.

447
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,554
I won't say I like you and that's enough.

448
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,682
Just…

449
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,394
let me see you

450
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,563
from a distance sometimes.

451
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:02,858
Just don't leave.

452
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,988
I can't even see you on TV now.

453
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:12,827
Please, Jeong-won.

454
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,746
I don't want to

455
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,917
pretend anymore.

456
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,586
If I'm with you,

457
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:26,632
I can't pretend I'm fine
or pretend we're nothing.

458
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,260
I just can't.

459
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:32,805
I'll…

460
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:36,767
be happy.

461
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:41,230
I'll eat well, sleep well

462
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:44,400
and be grateful I wake up each morning.

463
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,278
I'll raise my child well.

464
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,240
I'll be strong.

465
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:26,567
Okay.

466
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:29,820
Do as you please.

467
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,782
I'll do what I please.

468
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,578
I'll always think of you.

469
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,164
I'll keep calling you.

470
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,252
And I'll wait for you.

471
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:52,051
I'll keep loving you.

472
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:15,699
3 YEARS LATER

475
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,132
Can I help you?

476
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:34,510
Hey, wait.

477
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:37,388
You can't just walk in.

478
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:39,640
Wait. You can't film in here!

479
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:46,313
Wait. Don't film in here!

480
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,110
I'm Seo Jeong-won with Reporter Track.

481
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:55,364
Mr. Min, is it true you embezzled millions
from your company?

482
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:56,699
What are you…

483
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:58,784
Police will be here
for a search and seizure.

484
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:02,121
How about taking moral responsibility?

485
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,501
You beat us to it again.

486
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,430
Min Bong-jun, CEO of BJ Tour,
resigned immediately after

487
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:22,641
the police came
to carry out a search and seizure.

00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:29,857
Mi-so.

490
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:32,651
Hello.

491
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,736
Mi-so.

492
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:36,989
I'm sorry. Mom's late again.

493
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:40,576
-Did you have fun?
-Yes.

494
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,079
Kiss.

495
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:52,463
There are pretty flowers.

496
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:55,299
Mi-so, do you know what these are called?

497
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:57,009
-Tulip.
-Tulip.

498
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,886
-Tulip.
-Tulip.

499
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,350
Let's go get on a plane.

500
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:05,476
Okay.

501
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:07,102
Let's go.

502
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:14,443
Therefore, there's nothing to prove

503
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:18,238
that Gong Jun-ho colluded
with Seol Pan-ho in these charges.

504
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:21,659
So we can't say the defendant's part

505
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:25,871
in the conspiracy of murder was proven
beyond a reasonable doubt.

506
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:29,166
On the charge of conspiracy of murder,

507
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:32,294
due to a lack of evidence,
defendant Seol Pan-ho

508
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,254
is therefore found not guilty

509
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:35,631
JUDGE

510
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:44,223
-What the heck?
-Darn it.

511
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:01,657
CIVIL AFFAIRS OFFICE

512
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,619
We're here.

513
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:11,041
Here you go.

514
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:26,014
Conspiracy to murder Seo Sang-gyeon,
not guilty.

515
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:29,351
Darn it.

516
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,854
He pulled all sorts of tricks
to drag out the trial.

517
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:33,439
Our country has a long way to go.

518
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:36,525
Still, about the truck accident,
Mo Hyeong-taek

519
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:38,902
was found guilty
of influencing the investigation.

520
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:42,030
I guess that's a small relief.

521
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:43,657
Thanks for updating me right away.

522
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:46,368
It's just the first hearing.
Don't be too disappointed.

523
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:47,286
I won't.

524
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:21,403
Father,

525
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:26,033
you've never sent me a reply,

526
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:29,536
but I'm not yet sick of writing you.

527
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:32,206
Forget being sick of it,

528
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:35,626
I heard you were found not guilty
in your first trial.

529
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:37,628
That jolted me awake.

530
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:47,054
My time goes slowly,
but Mi-so's goes so fast.

531
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:50,807
She's learned more words
and gotten taller too.

532
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:55,187
Father,

533
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:57,731
my remaining goal in life

534
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:00,150
is to protect my daughter.

535
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:03,403
I'll shield her from any sadness

536
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:06,448
and let her do anything she wants.

537
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:11,954
I want only one thing from you.

538
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:16,875
For you to confess the truth.

539
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,963
I'll never give up, Father.

540
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:23,507
I'll cling to you
a countless number of times.

541
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:24,633
So…

542
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:26,552
You have a visitor.

543
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:44,903
Hi, Mi-so.

544
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,990
-Mom, look.
-Yes.

545
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,284
Mi-so, you've grown a lot.

546
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:53,704
Can I hold Mi-so?

547
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:56,582
Come here, Mi-so.

548
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:59,876
My gosh. You're heavy now.

549
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:03,171
How have you been?

550
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:08,844
What? What is this, Mi-so?

551
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:13,015
-It's for you, Dad.
-Really?

552
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,183
You brought me a flower?

553
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:17,352
Thanks.

554
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:27,988
I heard what happened
at my father's first trial.

555
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:31,033
I'm really sorry.

556
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:33,035
I know you did your best.

557
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:38,957
You're serving your sentence,
so only feel guilty for what you did,

558
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,834
not for what your father did.

559
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:43,420
All right, I won't.

560
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:47,883
This isn't a nice place.
Thanks for bringing Mi-so here.

561
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,095
And I'm sorry

562
00:48:52,929 --> 00:48:55,140
that I can't tell you to stop visiting me.

563
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:59,353
It means the world to me
to be able to see Mi-so like this.

564
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:04,107
I hope you understand.

565
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:10,280
Mi-so, when I get out of here,

566
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:13,659
let's go see some flowers together,
holding hands like this.

567
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:15,577
We'll go to the zoo too.

568
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:19,873
Let's go to the theme park too, okay?
Promise.

569
00:49:19,956 --> 00:49:22,459
Promise. Promise sealed.

570
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,266
Let's go eat something.

571
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:42,729
CHIEF KANG IN-HAN

572
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:45,691
-Yes.
-I saw your embezzlement report.

573
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:46,900
Are you at the office?

574
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:49,695
I'm actually in Seoul now.

575
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:51,405
Really? Where are you?

576
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,198
We should meet up if you're here.

577
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:04,543
Isn't it hard,
working while raising your child alone?

578
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:08,922
You said your ex-husband transferred
all his shares to your daughter.

579
00:50:09,005 --> 00:50:11,550
So why are you even working?

580
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:12,926
I guess I was born to work.

581
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:16,054
If I were you, I'd spend money
left and right and never work.

582
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:17,639
What's so great about the job?

583
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:24,813
Anyway, I've been promoted to director.

584
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:26,148
Congratulations.

585
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:29,151
Then I should call you Director Kang
from now on.

586
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:35,532
Since I got promoted, I have to produce
visible results right away.

587
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:39,953
So I plan to bring back Nothing Uncovered.

588
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:45,000
The show should be forgotten by now,
but the viewers keep wanting it.

589
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:46,376
It's her, isn't it?

590
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:49,296
See? All the customers here
know who you are.

591
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:50,505
They're whispering.

592
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,554
It's about time you moved back to Seoul.

593
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:59,222
Come back and work on the show.

594
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:02,058
Don't let someone
steal your show from you.

595
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:05,979
I've been asking you to come back
every year, so this is the third time.

596
00:51:06,062 --> 00:51:08,899
You've turned it down every time.
Don't you feel bad?

597
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:12,319
I'll think about it.

598
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:15,280
You're different this year.

599
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:18,700
Stop thinking and just do as I say.

600
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,730
I read the article about the embezzlement.

601
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:50,273
You're so cool, Seo Jeong-won.

602
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:53,401
I hear it rained a lot in Jeju.
You're keeping well, right?

603
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,445
I caught a wanted criminal.

604
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:58,490
I want to lie that I got hurt
so you'd call me.

605
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:02,869
It's gotten quite cold.
Make sure you bundle up.

606
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:04,996
Merry Christmas.

607
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:06,873
Happy New Year.

608
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:09,543
Hey, Jeong-won. You're doing well, right?

609
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:13,630
I feel like the new year just began
but January has come to an end.

610
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:14,673
Time really flies.

611
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:16,299
I got promoted.

612
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:19,636
They say it's gotten hot
and flowers are blooming in February.

613
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,721
Spring really is here, Jeong-won.

614
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:23,348
It's such a gloomy day today.

615
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:25,308
Detective Oh had his fourth child.

616
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:28,770
I've been reading the books
you recommended in the past.

617
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,689
MAY 2, 2027

618
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,945
DETECTIVE KIM TAE-HEON

619
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:40,031
I'm at the camping ground
where we went together.

620
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:42,701
I miss you.

621
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:38,840
That jerk!

622
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:42,761
Drop the knife.

623
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:45,430
Hey!

624
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:47,933
Drop the knife.

625
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:53,688
You're on drugs, aren't you?

626
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:57,192
Drop the knife.

627
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,363
I said drop the knife.

628
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:44,531
Jeong-won,

629
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:49,494
you still have that determined look
in your eyes!

630
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:51,246
My gosh. He's right.

631
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:52,956
You look like your old self.

632
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:55,500
It's nice to hear that. It's been so long.

633
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:59,838
My goodness. Hey, it's been so long.
Aren't you happy to see us?

634
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:02,382
Also, you should've come
straight to the office.

635
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:03,758
Is this studio more important?

636
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:05,802
Look at you, trying to pick a fight again.

637
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:10,640
"I'm happy to see you again."
Would it kill you to speak honestly?

638
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:11,891
No, it won't.

639
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:15,562
I mean, I am happy.
But one shouldn't change suddenly.

640
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:17,731
That might kill you.

641
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,816
Also, Chief Kang…

642
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:22,027
I mean, Director Kang. You saw him too.

643
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:25,030
He's trying to look all serious
when he can't pull it off.

644
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:26,197
When you see him,

645
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:28,867
-you can't help but cringe.
-He's right.

646
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:32,787
Now that he's a director,
he always talks in a serious voice.

647
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:34,581
-I can't take it.
-I can't either.

648
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:37,876
We have a meeting.

649
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:39,419
-Let's go.
-Let's go. Come on.

650
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:42,922
Does Detective Kim know
that you're in Seoul now?

651
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:49,179
Once we announce that we're bringing
the show back, he'll find out.

652
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:51,556
Shouldn't you tell him yourself?

653
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:03,777
I knew this day would come eventually,

654
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:08,031
but it took longer than I expected.

655
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:11,117
What?

656
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:13,119
It's nothing.

657
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:20,376
Let's pour our hearts and souls into it
and make sure the first episode is a hit.

658
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:25,757
I hope we can choose an issue
people are most interested in these days.

659
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,301
Random killing sprees?
Something like that?

660
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:33,431
Abnormal motive crimes are on the rise.

661
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:36,726
When did the stabbing spree
at Dongsin Station take place?

662
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,144
Right. One moment, please.

663
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:43,691
My gosh. Another stabbing spree
took place in Gwangho-dong.

664
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,319
What?

665
00:56:46,402 --> 00:56:49,864
A detective from Gangha Police's
Violent Crimes is critically injured.

666
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:51,616
Hold on.

667
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,620
Then it might be
Detective Kim Tae-heon. Right?

668
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,501
Hey.

669
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:31,948
What happened?

670
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:34,033
-A car accident.
-His vitals?

671
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,326
It was 100 over 40.

672
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:36,703
He was in a car accident!

673
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:38,621
Coming through!

674
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:43,460
Seo Jeong-won?

675
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:46,546
Jeong-won.

676
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,528
How…

677
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:13,573
When did you arrive in Seoul?

678
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:16,201
I heard a detective

679
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:21,289
from Gangha Police's Violent Crimes
sustained a critical injury

680
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:24,584
while quelling a stabbing spree.

681
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:29,088
They misreported.

682
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:30,840
As you can see,

683
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,301
I'm okay.

684
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:42,769
A while back, you threatened me
and told me never to die before you.

685
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,356
I won't die.

686
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:48,775
I can't die leaving you behind.

687
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,363
Look at me.

688
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:55,323
Hey, look at me.

689
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:58,701
Why are you crying?

690
00:58:58,785 --> 00:58:59,786
Don't cry.

691
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:10,421
I want to give you a hug right now,

692
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:13,633
but I can't because of this crutch.

693
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:18,304
Don't cry. I'm okay.

694
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:23,184
Were you worried about me?

695
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:43,788
What's wrong? Are you all right?

696
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:45,832
Hand it over.

697
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:52,547
There.

698
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:14,902
Jeong-won?

699
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:16,613
What?

700
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,705
Don't you think
things will work out between us?

701
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:36,716
Gosh, what's wrong?

702
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,343
-Be careful.
-I'm fine.
