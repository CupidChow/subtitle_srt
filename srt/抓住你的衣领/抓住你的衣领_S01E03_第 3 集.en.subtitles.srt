1
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:49,299
All locations, people, organizations, and
incidents in this drama are fictitious.

2
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,150
It suits you.

3
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,569
You told me I had to wear this today.

4
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,529
You look pretty.

5
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:13,740
Let's go.

6
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:20,205
The place is empty.

7
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,290
This is…

8
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,670
our wedding.

9
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,760
So this is my bridal bouquet?

10
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,771
You said you didn't want a wedding,

11
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,233
but you're marrying
a business tycoon's son.

12
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,902
I couldn't forgo the ceremony.

13
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:52,046
This is the most romantic moment
of my life.

14
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,635
Jeong-won,

15
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,680
thank you for being mine.

16
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:05,018
I'll make sure
you always stay happy and radiant.

17
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:08,354
I love you.

18
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,344
Hey, Jeong-won.

19
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,638
Our wedding was over in four minutes.

20
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,143
Seol Woo-jae,

21
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:52,190
why did you go to Leaders Palace
the day Cha Eun-sae died?

22
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,664
Who is it?

23
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,290
I'm a detective
from Gangha Police Station.

24
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,768
I'm from Gangha Police Station's
Violent Crimes Unit One.

25
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,770
Lieutenant Kim Tae-heon.

26
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,607
-Mr. Seol Woo-jae, right?
-Yes, what is this about?

27
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,069
-Why are you--
-This is about Cha Eun-sae's case.

28
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,990
I need you to come with me.

29
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:50,790
Why do you need to interrogate
my husband as a witness?

30
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,333
You can ask him later.

31
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:02,802
We couldn't reach you over the phone,
so I came here to get you myself.

32
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:05,471
We have some questions for you.
Please come with me.

33
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,015
Sure.

34
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:10,810
I won't be long.

35
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,564
Let's go.

36
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,795
Detective Oh,

37
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:42,258
have you read Mr. Seol's latest novel,
Hot Shot?

38
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,304
Well, I only read books
when I can't fall asleep.

39
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,973
It's good. You have to read it.

40
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,433
One of the characters

41
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,227
gets stabbed in the stomach and dies.

42
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,187
What?

43
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,023
You must've done a lot of research
into crimes while writing the book.

44
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:02,487
I'm still an amateur
compared to you detectives.

45
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,571
Mr. Seol,

46
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:07,283
do you know why we're interrogating you
as a witness in Cha's case?

47
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,206
According to her call history,

48
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:17,001
you were the person she called the most.

49
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:20,463
You were also the last person she called.

50
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,632
-Is that so?
-"Is that so"?

51
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,554
Cha Eun-sae was your lover, wasn't she?

52
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:30,890
Cha Eun-sae was my stalker.

53
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:31,891
You weren't lovers?

54
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:35,853
As you can see from the call log,
she called me, I never called her.

55
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,439
Did you go through her phone?

56
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:41,025
Was there any evidence
that we were lovers?

57
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:44,362
Her phone wasn't at the crime scene,
so we don't know.

58
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,155
Really? That's unfortunate.

59
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:50,576
She was your stalker, nothing more?

60
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,997
I'm a victim too.

61
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,582
When did she start stalking you?

62
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,710
We met last year at an afterparty
at the publishing house.

63
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,588
She's been obsessed with me ever since.

64
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:06,968
She'd call me and visit me all the time
and get all clingy.

65
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:08,511
That's all.

66
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,805
When was the last time you saw her?

67
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,017
She came to my studio from time to time.

68
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,728
I think I saw her about two weeks ago.

69
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,231
Then why did you go to Leaders Palace

70
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,025
around 4:00 p.m. on October 6th?

71
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,420
He was there
an hour before her time of death.

72
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,297
Why?

73
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,967
I went to a restaurant to pick up food.

74
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,969
Now you'll ask me where I went afterwards.

75
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,596
I went to my studio.

76
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:54,724
You knew that her agency's office
was in that building.

77
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,560
-I didn't.
-On October 6th, where were you…

78
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,355
between 5:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m.?

79
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,525
I was drinking at my studio, alone.

80
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,610
Alone?

81
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,320
You were

82
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,363
alone?

83
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,159
Cha Eun-sae

84
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,745
was pregnant.

85
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,040
I thought you were the baby's father.

86
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,167
You're saying she stalked you.

87
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,044
I'm quite confused.

88
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,670
I'm more confused than you are.

89
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,672
You should talk to her sponsor, not me.

90
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:31,594
Wait,

91
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:33,554
you didn't know?

92
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,600
Cha Eun-sae once told me
she had a sponsor.

93
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,394
I assumed
you'd be looking into it already.

94
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,188
I guess I gave you a lead there.

95
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,232
Cha Eun-sae told you that?

96
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,318
-Who was her--
-She never told me who it was.

97
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:50,029
You guys are pros.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

98
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,076
Stop cutting me off.

99
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:58,287
And I don't like
your condescending attitude towards us.

100
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,247
Detective Oh.

101
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,708
Without a proper investigation,
you concluded that I was her lover.

102
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,418
That was unprofessional of you.

103
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,587
What did Cha Eun-sae say
when she called you

104
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,839
at 4:30 p.m. on October 6th?

105
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,395
"You obnoxious jerk."

106
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,024
That's what she said.

107
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:32,071
She called me obnoxious
because I was married

108
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,532
and didn't like her back.

109
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,536
Are we done here?

110
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,456
We're done.

111
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,043
But we're collecting DNA samples
to find out who the baby's father is.

112
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,005
Do you consent to providing a sample?

113
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,298
Like you said,

114
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,341
you are married.

115
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:56,262
If you decline without a valid reason,
we'll get a warrant.

116
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,641
Sign this.

117
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,402
Will you say "ah" for me?

118
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,240
Ah.

119
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:33,674
Check if Seol Woo-jae ordered takeout
from a restaurant at Leaders Palace,

120
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,718
and trace his movements for that day.

121
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:39,472
You don't really believe
that he was stalked, do you?

122
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,307
Can't you tell he's lying?!

123
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,143
He'll be done for
after the paternity test.

124
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:47,104
So what he said about Cha having a sponsor
was just a distraction?

125
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,564
Check her bank accounts.

126
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,234
Did you find out
the brand of that necklace?

127
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,028
They're still working on that.

128
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:55,905
I'll follow up.

129
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,719
What did Cha Eun-sae say
when she called you

130
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,930
at 4:30 p.m. on October 6th?

131
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,079
You obnoxious jerk. Listen up.

132
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,365
How is the police reacting
to Cha's pregnancy?

133
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,908
What about the interrogation?

134
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,536
They questioned her older brother,
Cha Geum-sae.

135
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:28,414
That's it?
They've only questioned one guy so far?

136
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:31,876
Yes.

137
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:36,922
The police must be counting on the
likelihood that her lover is the killer.

138
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,007
They don't have a suspect?

139
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:41,051
Will you look into Cha's brother first?

140
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,679
Yes, that's our plan for now.

141
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:45,347
But he's a real lowlife.

142
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,558
There's talk that he could be guilty.

143
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,059
That would be amazing.

144
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,770
A brother killing his sister
would make for great TV.

145
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,273
Hey, I just remembered something.

146
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:57,943
There was a rumor last month
that Mo Hyeong-taek was Cha's sponsor.

147
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,070
Do you remember hearing that?

148
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,655
That's disrespectful of you.

149
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,741
How dare you repeat such trash!

150
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,242
You went after him already!

151
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,369
Don't say anything like that again!

152
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,168
It's not the first time
I've brought up a rumor.

153
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,586
Why did he overreact?

154
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:18,964
Mo Hyeong-taek's old enough
to be Cha's father.

155
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,091
Isn't her pregnancy shocking?

156
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,969
It's not.
It's fine as long as the guy's single.

157
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,262
No, it's not.

158
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,972
-Hello.
-Hello, Mr. Seol.

159
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,474
What did you bring us?

160
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,892
Something to cheer you up.

161
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,852
-Must be a busy day.
-Yes.

162
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:33,729
-Would you excuse us?
-Sure.

163
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:35,898
-Come with me.
-Okay.

164
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,526
Bye.

165
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,909
Tell me what you were doing there
the day Cha died.

166
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,411
I know you were there.

167
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,122
The GPS records show
your other phone was there.

168
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,666
What?

169
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,460
You went there to see Cha, didn't you?

170
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,508
I went to get takeout
from a Chinese restaurant.

171
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,385
I didn't meet Cha Eun-sae.

172
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:07,846
The detective must have questioned you
because there's proof that you did.

173
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:08,931
That's not why…

174
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:11,892
I'm the last person

175
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,979
Cha Eun-sae called before she died.

176
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,314
What?

177
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,778
-What's wrong? Are you okay?
-Don't touch me.

178
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:24,989
Mr. Seol.

179
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,366
How are you, sir?

180
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:31,036
You know Ms. Seo's husband,
Mr. Seol, right?

181
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,413
Of course I do.

182
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:36,584
You look just like your father,
and you have his manner too.

183
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,214
Did we interrupt a lover's spat?
Should we leave?

184
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,841
No, sir. Not at all.

185
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,844
You should go.
You're late for your appointment.

186
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,138
Yes, I am.

187
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,600
I'll take your leave.

188
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:53,684
Bye.

189
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,153
Cha Eun-sae was my stalker.

190
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:08,282
As you can see from the call log,
she called me, I never called her.

191
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,493
Seol Woo-jae did get takeout.

192
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,038
No update on the paternity test yet?

193
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,498
Did you notice anything odd about him?

194
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,001
His expression never changed.

195
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,171
"You obnoxious jerk."

196
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,884
Come on,
I was just imitating Seol Woo-jae.

197
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:27,885
Wrong answer.

198
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,680
Wait, I've got it.

199
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,058
That he answered our questions so well.

200
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,477
He's a writer, after all.
He's familiar with the scenario.

201
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,561
Wrong again.

202
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:41,649
I would've got two burgers
if you'd told me you were hungry.

203
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:42,608
What is it?

204
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,819
Did you go through her phone?

205
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:49,281
Was there any evidence
that we were lovers?

206
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,158
What about it?

207
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,744
He probably said that
because he had nothing to hide.

208
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,538
Maybe he has a lot to hide,

209
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,917
and he also knew Cha's phone was missing.

210
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,420
Yeah, you're right!

211
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,215
If he's the killer,
he'd have taken her phone.

212
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:10,427
-What about Cha's bank accounts?
-Right. I looked through them.

213
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,846
What kind of celebrity
has no money in their account?

214
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,683
A credit card bill for 15 million.
She had nothing left.

215
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,518
Any suspicious withdrawals?

216
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,645
Just the monthly payments to her brother.

217
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:20,980
It's squeaky clean otherwise.

218
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,735
Either there was no sponsor,
or they left no record of it.

219
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:27,945
It's one or the other.

220
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,243
Let's play.

221
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,453
Thanks.

222
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,461
Here's your drink.

223
00:16:58,767 --> 00:16:59,685
Shoot.

224
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:08,944
Damn it.

225
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,335
Screw this.

226
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:40,142
This is driving me insane.

227
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,560
Absolutely insane.

228
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,855
You didn't win tonight?

229
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,733
I'm Seo Jeong-won from Nothing Uncovered.

230
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,027
Mind if I interview you outside?

231
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,239
You brought a camera?

232
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,576
I have nothing to say to you.
Leave me alone.

233
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,828
We're taking an in-depth look
at Cha Eun-sae's death.

234
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:03,582
Your sister died an untimely death.
Don't you have anything to say about that?

235
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,128
I said, leave me alone.

236
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,922
What's wrong with you people?

237
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,884
Cha Geum-sae's ID
is "Ten Thousand Percent."

238
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,804
You know, Mr. Cha,
we're also investigating gambling sites.

239
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,348
Which episode
would you like to feature in,

240
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,100
your sister's death, or gambling?

241
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,226
What?

242
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,020
That's an outright threat.

243
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,107
Casinos exist so people can have fun.

244
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,442
I'm talking about illegal gambling sites.

245
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,860
Mr. Ten Thousand Percent.

246
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,445
That's you, isn't it?

247
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,658
I've dealt with enough reporters
in my time.

248
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,494
Do you take me for a pushover?

249
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:44,289
I know so many people in your field.

250
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,375
Hello?

251
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,127
What? You scratched…

252
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,298
Stay where you are,
keep your head on the ground.

253
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,802
Damn it!

254
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:06,270
Where is it? Where's the scratch?

255
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:10,232
Damn it. Where are you?!

256
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,400
Screw it.

257
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,860
You didn't answer my calls.

258
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:15,112
I thought your phone was broken.

259
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:16,738
Oh, God.

260
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,702
We got to him first.

261
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,162
The investigation comes first.

262
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,288
Turn off the camera.

263
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,455
You, get in the car.

264
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,958
What for? Why should I get in the car?

265
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,419
Are you arresting me or something?

266
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,674
Hey, don't turn off that thing.
I need you to film this.

267
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,050
I'm the victim's family,

268
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:40,596
and this detective is treating me
like a murderer. Make sure you film it!

269
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,432
What's that thing you always say?

270
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,434
That your viewers
have a right to the truth?

271
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,643
Show them this.

272
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,854
-Yeah, show them everything.
-Hey.

273
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,147
Damn you.

274
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,232
What are you doing, man?

275
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,484
We know your sister hit you,

276
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,112
so you strangled her
three days before she died.

277
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:01,325
We know you threatened her with a knife
two weeks before her death.

278
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:02,701
And you have no alibi.

279
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:05,996
I wonder what the viewers will think
of you once this airs on TV.

280
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,251
According to our sources,
you got a 300-million payout

281
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,754
for an accidental-death claim
on her insurance.

282
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,633
Your gambling debt
also happened to be 300 million won.

283
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,635
Unbelievable.

284
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:24,139
What are you trying to say?

285
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,851
That I killed my sister for money?
Are you insane?

286
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,687
Don't change the subject.
Tell me why you choked her.

287
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:35,025
Because she kept making me mad.

288
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,110
Think about how angry I got.

289
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,820
Exactly. Why did you get angry?

290
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:42,532
She went through so much to become
successful, but she wanted to retire!

291
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:43,450
I'm done here.

292
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,410
So you killed her for money?

293
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,329
I didn't kill her, damn it!

294
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,623
She already knew she was going to die.

295
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,500
What do you mean?

296
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,210
She told me so herself.

297
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,963
She said a lot of people
were trying to kill her,

298
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,881
and that one of them was a murderer.

299
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,175
-And who is that murderer?
-I have no idea.

300
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,428
I asked her to tell me,
but she ignored me to the end.

301
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:08,934
You know what? I'm grieving here.
I deserve to be treated with respect,

302
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,519
not like a murder suspect!

303
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,646
I didn't mean to yell.
Are you still filming?

304
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:13,855
Yeah, I'm filming.

305
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,317
Come get the phone.

306
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,155
Let's wrap up for today.

307
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,741
I'll request
another meeting with you later.

308
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,201
Sure. Whatever.

309
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,708
Cha Eun-sae had a sponsor, didn't she?

310
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,587
Whatever do you mean?

311
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,350
This is driving me crazy. You know that?

312
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,769
The detectives are on my case.

313
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,397
Seo Jeong-won has been harassing me.

314
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,274
Come on! Step on it, you jerk!

315
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:59,401
Well, if you're cleared,
there's no problem.

316
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,654
Do you not trust me either?

317
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,906
I'm disappointed.

318
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,536
Let's meet soon.

319
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,420
CHA EUN-SAE
OF "DATING MY EX-HUSBAND" DEAD.

320
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,638
You couldn't restore anything?

321
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,766
The motherboard was completely fried.

322
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,185
I tried to restore it, but I couldn't.

323
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,247
Where are you going at this hour?

324
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:58,126
The police collected my DNA for a test.
They said the results are out.

325
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:03,673
Come on.

326
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:29,116
So we meet again.

327
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,910
Give us the results of the paternity test.

328
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,255
It was negative.

329
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:50,762
That means
this is the last time we see each other.

330
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,597
I think not. But we'll see about that.

331
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,641
Are you going to stay here?

332
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,644
-Why would I?
-In case you want to talk.

333
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:00,063
I hear you two know each other very well.

334
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:02,482
Not at all.

335
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,947
I thought we were friends.
That's why I told you the results.

336
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,409
I'll be careful from now on.

337
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,913
The two of you look lovely together.

338
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:18,790
What a sweet couple.

339
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,315
I need a drink.

340
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:46,193
You crazy?
You were hospitalized for cirrhosis.

341
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:51,114
I know this is pretty lame,

342
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:54,117
but as you know,
having a sponsor is a personal matter.

343
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,953
Don't tell me you read the tabloids again.

344
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,747
I thought only a few men
would be involved,

345
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,082
but at least five
have been named as her sponsors.

346
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:07,297
An advertiser, a movie director, an actor,
agency president, lawyer, an assemblyman.

347
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,506
This is the list.

348
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,383
Want to know something interesting?

349
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,052
You've met one of them already.

350
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,891
Mo Hyeong-taek?

351
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,069
Since when and why
do you have a second phone?

352
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:32,614
I've always had it.

353
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:35,200
It's tiring to answer spam calls.

354
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:36,409
I needed a second number.

355
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,204
Why didn't you tell me?

356
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:43,124
Because I rarely used it.

357
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:46,878
How is it that Cha knew
about your second phone, and I didn't?

358
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,421
I have no idea.

359
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,090
And that's not all.

360
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:52,759
She knew my car number
and my studio address.

361
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,847
You blocked her on your primary phone,

362
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,392
but not on your second phone?

363
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:06,064
She threatened me.

364
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,483
She said she'd kill herself if I did.

365
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,778
She was more than capable of doing that.

366
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,489
I really had no other choice, Jeong-won.

367
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:16,783
If you really were innocent in all this,

368
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,369
why would you dump the phone?

369
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:20,287
Because it broke.

370
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,293
What's important here
is the result of the paternity test.

371
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,170
"Hard evidence always wins
over circumstantial evidence."

372
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,339
That's your motto, isn't it?

373
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,263
I went to my studio and thought about it.

374
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:42,267
The day before her death,
she told you she and I were lovers.

375
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,393
It made sense.

376
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:45,186
She was abnormally obsessed with me.

377
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,897
But why did it have to happen
when we were there?

378
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,358
Why was she murdered
right after she called me?

379
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:55,030
I don't understand why it had to happen
at that very moment.

380
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:59,367
It seems a little suspicious.
Don't you agree?

381
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,579
Isn't it possible

382
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:05,623
that this is a set-up,
and that someone is after us?

383
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,292
That person is the real killer.

384
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,465
We need to think about this carefully

385
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:17,469
and figure out
who would want to hurt us this way.

386
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:52,087
Did you have an appointment today?

387
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,089
I'm here regarding Cha Eun-sae's case.

388
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,091
Could I talk to you real quick?

389
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:08,561
I could have ended up
at the murder scene that day.

390
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:09,813
Oh, right.

391
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,483
I was supposed to type "Unit 1201,"
not "Unit 1401."

392
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:14,943
I'm sorry about that.

393
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,695
Did you send me that text from your phone?

394
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,072
No, from my computer.

395
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:23,326
I sent the correct unit number
to all the other patients that day,

396
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:28,832
but I don't know how only you
ended up with the wrong information.

397
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,017
What on earth…

398
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,812
CHA AND SEOL WERE IN A RELATIONSHIP

399
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,147
This can't be true.

400
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,236
Are you okay?
Did you know about this?

401
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,487
AE-NA

402
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:04,033
The motherboard was completely fried.

403
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:06,745
I tried to restore it, but I couldn't.

404
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,166
SHOCKING SCANDAL
REPORTER HWANG GI-SEOK

405
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,960
Reporter Hwang of Ganghan Daily.

406
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:16,588
Find out who tipped him off
about the scandal.

407
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:17,672
Right now.

408
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,346
THE LATE ACTRESS…

409
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,264
OH MYEONG-SOO

410
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,642
-Yes.
-You have no idea how hard it was

411
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,186
to unlock Hwang's phone.

412
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,812
Who tipped him off?

413
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,076
ZEUS

414
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,497
Did you find out who it was?

415
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,041
It was easy.
They exchanged emails and calls.

416
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,752
-The number is…
-0-1-0-2…

417
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:56,711
Do you know him?

418
00:29:58,254 --> 00:29:59,464
Can you track his phone?

419
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,105
-Follow that car.
-All right.

420
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,876
I'm only going to ask once.

421
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:38,461
Did you do it?

422
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,671
No.

423
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:42,048
A delayed response
will only make matters worse.

424
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:43,925
-Stop trying to fool me.
-I didn't do it!

425
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,514
Why won't you believe me?

426
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,141
You know why.

427
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,147
I have to go.

428
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:06,614
Look! Here he comes!

429
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,916
Is it true
you were Ms. Cha's lover, Mr. Seol?

430
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,127
You were called in as a witness, yes?

431
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,921
Do you have anything to say to your wife
regarding the matter?

432
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:49,657
He's not here.

433
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,701
Are you sure this is the right place?

434
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:53,202
Yes, that's the place.

435
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:55,747
I'll call again.

436
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:09,510
I'm sorry.

437
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,310
Hey!

438
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:18,478
Stop!

439
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,681
Are you okay?

440
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,995
No, wait!

441
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:19,831
-You tipped Hwang off, didn't you?
-No. It wasn't me.

442
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:22,333
Where is the photo
you sold to Reporter Hwang?

443
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,293
On my laptop.

444
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,344
Open the file.

445
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,520
How could you do this to me?

446
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:45,690
Well, I got caught red-handed
by your husband.

447
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:48,776
What do you mean?

448
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,252
What?

449
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,506
Delete it.

450
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,677
Did my wife order you to do it?

451
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:16,637
Yes.

452
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:23,895
This should be more than enough
to destroy the motherboard completely.

453
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:27,940
Once you're done,
I want you to tell my wife,

454
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:32,111
"It's impossible to restore it."

455
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:35,698
DELETE THE DATA?
OK

456
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:07,396
Look,

457
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,940
you need to get your act together.

458
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,458
What do you think?

459
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:31,546
Who looks better in the necklace,
is it me or Seo Jeong-won?

460
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:35,675
Can we not talk about her
when we're together?

461
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:43,391
I am Cha Eun-sae of Nothing Uncovered.

462
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:51,732
Today, I'm going to uncover
the sexy novelist, Seol Woo-jae.

463
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,778
Why does he make women grow impatient?

464
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:04,370
Why can't that woman and I
come to our senses?

465
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,622
Tell us one by one.

466
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:10,001
That part was spot-on.

467
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:11,419
The last part.

468
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:21,470
Really?

469
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:26,642
Gosh.

470
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,318
Should I stop?

471
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,373
I love you, Eun-sae.

472
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:07,934
HUSBAND

473
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:17,151
Hey, did you see the article?

474
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:22,323
I'm sorry
to put you on the spot like this.

475
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,283
I'll explain the photo later.

476
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:28,579
But one thing's clear
from today's fake article.

477
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:33,751
Someone's trying to set us up
using Cha Eun-sae's case.

478
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,055
What is it?

479
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:50,142
It's just absurd, that's all.

480
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:52,645
I'll see you later.

481
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:39,775
SEOL DENIES DATING THE LATE CHA EUN-SAE

482
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,903
I love my wife.

483
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:45,614
And I'll only love her

484
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,826
until my last breath.

485
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,454
NOVELIST SEOL'S INTERVIEW

486
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:54,832
SEOL DENIES THE AFFAIR
"I ONLY LOVE MY WIFE…"

487
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:15,019
Woo-jae!

488
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:17,563
Woo-jae.

489
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:22,568
I told your wife everything.

490
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,738
Next, I'm going to tell the press.

491
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:31,035
You can't get away from me now, honey.

492
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,371
I love you.

493
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:13,411
Are you out of your mind?
Don't you see the lights?

494
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,037
What's wrong with you?

495
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:27,091
The person you are calling is--

496
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,940
I've been here for a while.
You're quite slow.

497
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,609
Is this

498
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,987
some kind of surveillance?

499
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:49,447
I was just looking.

500
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:53,117
And wondering
how you turned out like this.

501
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:56,537
"Was this guy always such a loser?"

502
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,497
Something like that.

503
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:01,041
You have

504
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:03,127
a twisted mind.

505
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,048
It's better than being twisted.

506
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:11,427
You punk.

507
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:14,680
You called her a stalker
because the dead can't talk.

508
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,517
I see you remain unconvinced

509
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:20,978
even after the DNA results?

510
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:22,813
There's a video of you sleeping with her.

511
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,107
I have it.

512
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:28,277
So does Ms. Seo.

513
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,030
You hear me? Your wife has seen the video.

514
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:38,829
"I love you, Eun-sae"?

515
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,677
You're going to be spending
a lot of time with me.

516
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:55,095
As a suspect.

517
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:10,486
Detective.

518
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:19,328
There's something I need to tell you.

519
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:04,498
Jeong-won.

520
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:12,756
Stop it.

521
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,175
Let go!

522
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,762
I gave you a chance.

523
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:22,766
If you'd admitted to the affair
when I found your other phone,

524
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,518
it would've been better.

525
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:30,232
You slept with a woman imitating your wife
in your studio.

526
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:32,067
You told her you loved her.

527
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,613
And you say she stalked you?

528
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,157
You're a jerk.

529
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,491
It's true that she stalked me.

530
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,661
I rejected her, but she kept on--

531
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,747
How many times did you sleep with her?

532
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:47,416
Did you enjoy it?

533
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:48,959
Was she different from me?

534
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:52,087
What?

535
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:53,839
Should I stop?

536
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,758
Does it hurt?

537
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:57,176
Do you hurt more than me?

538
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,345
Calm down and…

539
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,181
If I hadn't seen that disgusting video,

540
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,142
you'd have lied to me forever.

541
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:07,853
You almost had me fooled.

542
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,397
What a shame.

543
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:11,732
-Jeong-won.
-What?!

544
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:16,862
Did you like her that much?

545
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:20,324
Why did you like her?
What was it about her?

546
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:23,369
Tell me. I want an answer!

547
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:34,880
She hungered for love.

548
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,842
I felt sorry for her
because she was lonely.

549
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:41,720
She reminded me of myself.

550
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,266
You call that an excuse?

551
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,770
From the moment you and I started dating,
and even till today…

552
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:53,690
I never felt loved back.

553
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,697
You don't love me as much as I love you.

554
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:04,660
Gratitude and comfort. That was it.

555
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:16,004
We got married because I loved you.

556
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:19,258
But I wanted to be noticed and loved too.

557
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:22,386
I told myself not to get my hopes up,
but it was hard not to.

558
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:24,930
All you care about is your job.

559
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:26,598
It made me feel lonely.

560
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:32,229
Fine.

561
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:36,483
I'm always busy with work,
and I don't know how to express myself.

562
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,777
Let's say you're right.

563
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:42,865
But does that make it my fault
that you had an affair?

564
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,246
Cha Eun-sae…

565
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,290
You killed her, didn't you?

566
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:09,850
He went into the building then,
and left at around 9:00 p.m.

567
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:12,352
-And the motorcycle's camera got him?
-Yes.

568
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:15,898
The motorcyclist
asked me to give this to you.

569
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:17,649
Thanks.

570
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:31,872
I have an alibi for Cha Eun-sae's murder.

571
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:33,957
I told the detective about it.

572
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,292
So what if you have an alibi?

573
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:38,670
You could have hired someone
to kill her for you.

574
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:39,755
What?

575
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,758
You brought it up on purpose.

576
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:44,593
About someone trying to frame us.

577
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:50,682
I understand how you feel,
but you're crossing the line.

578
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,476
You crossed the line first.

579
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:53,894
You kept lying to me.

580
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:57,523
You have shattered my dreams!

581
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:01,818
To me,

582
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:05,072
you're the prime suspect
of Cha Eun-sae's murder.

583
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:08,909
Jeong-won…

584
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:12,246
You're not thinking straight.

585
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:13,413
You got that right.

586
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:18,168
Now watch how far
your crazed wife will go.

587
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:36,395
He seems so sweet on TV
but acts completely differently here.

588
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:39,356
Why was Seol Woo-jae so angry that day?

589
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:40,983
I was rude to him.

590
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:45,112
However rude you were to him,
he's guilty of obstruction of business.

591
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,196
Why didn't you report him?

592
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:48,740
Excuse me.

593
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:52,077
I told him not to report it.

594
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:56,081
He came back the next day
and apologized profusely.

595
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:58,625
I didn't think we'd meet again like this.

596
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:01,253
Are you still investigating
Ms. Jin's death?

597
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:02,838
Of course.

598
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:05,674
It'll take a while,
but we'll catch the killer.

599
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:38,540
I love you, Eun-sae.

600
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:29,735
Ah, you're here.

601
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:34,614
How do you know the passcode?

602
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:38,535
When she gave me the passcode
for her new house,

603
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,289
she said it was the same as her lover's.

604
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,003
Look at you.

605
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:50,756
You're Eun-sae's lover, huh?

606
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,180
Well…

607
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:03,685
You jerk.

608
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:06,563
You want me to round up all the reporters
including your wife

609
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:08,273
and hold a press conference?

610
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:09,900
I'll tell them you were her lover,

611
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:12,402
and that you killed her
because she was pregnant.

612
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:16,156
Look at you.

613
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:21,578
If you don't want to be called a murderer,
you'd better find a way to keep me quiet.

614
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,376
-It's about money.
-Don't smirk.

615
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,298
How dare you smirk at me!

616
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:36,176
Damn it.

617
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:45,769
Forget about money.

618
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:47,729
It's easier to keep you quiet this way.

619
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:51,483
Hold a press conference. Go ahead.

620
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:54,986
The baby she was carrying wasn't mine.

621
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:57,322
And I have an alibi too.

622
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:10,877
You see, Eun-sae relied on me a lot.

623
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,337
Is that so?

624
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:15,382
She asked me to hold on to the evidence
that you beat her.

625
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:20,554
What would happen if I disclosed
the photos and medical certificate?

626
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:25,100
"He constantly beat his sister for money,
and eventually killed her."

627
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:26,560
That's what they'd say.

628
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:28,061
Hey.

629
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:29,855
Shut your mouth, you murderer.

630
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:32,607
Did you know
I was the last person she called?

631
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:37,070
She said she had to hang up
because you had just arrived.

632
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,408
That's why

633
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:43,451
I think you're the killer.

634
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:49,749
You must have lost your mind, punk.

635
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:51,543
Tell me…

636
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:55,046
Did you really not kill her?

637
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:13,732
4:48 P.M. TO 5:25 P.M.

638
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:25,869
That jerk.

639
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:28,163
He was with a woman.

640
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:31,458
-That's why he didn't disclose his alibi.
-What?

641
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:34,336
Who is this woman?

642
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:40,884
Someone he doesn't want
Seo Jeong-won and me to find out out.

643
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:42,135
He was seeing another woman?

644
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:49,059
Tae-heon, they've figured out
where the necklace is from.

645
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:50,644
It's a luxury brand called Harry Joyce.

646
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:51,978
Harry Joyce?

647
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,483
JEWELRY AND HIGH JEWELRY NECKLACES

648
00:53:58,526 --> 00:53:59,903
I only see women's necklaces here.

649
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:01,863
They don't sell men's necklaces?

650
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:04,157
Then it's likely the killer is a woman.

651
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:12,499
-The person you are calling is…
-Why isn't she answering?

652
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,084
Sir.

653
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,672
You know the mess we're in!
What took you so long?

654
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:22,384
Now you start to slack off because
you can't present the 9:00 p.m. news?

655
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:25,303
I needed some time
to recover from that article.

656
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:27,263
-No excuses. Just tell me--
-I'll tell you.

657
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:28,682
My husband had an affair.

658
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:32,435
He did.

659
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:34,813
But he wasn't the father of Cha's baby.

660
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:37,273
What? That doesn't make sense.

661
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:41,152
How do you know that your husband
and Cha Eun-sae had an affair?

662
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:45,365
The police confirmed it.
But the paternity test was negative.

663
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:48,201
Hold on. Let me get this straight.

664
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:50,620
She was seeing another man?

665
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,288
That's what I'm going to find out.

666
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:55,709
He might not be the baby's father,
but he could still be the killer.

667
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,210
Are you okay to go on?

668
00:54:57,293 --> 00:55:00,964
What do you think would happen
if people knew

669
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:03,925
that a wife was investigating her husband
for murder?

670
00:55:05,301 --> 00:55:08,555
I'm sure it would go viral,
like never before.

671
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,057
Do you want to pass this up?

672
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:15,770
Sure, you're famous
for uncovering people's secrets,

673
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:18,773
but you didn't know that
you own husband was having an affair.

674
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:21,818
What would our viewers say about that?

675
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:26,156
They'll want his wife, not just
any reporter, to investigate this case.

676
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:28,158
I don't agree.

677
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:30,118
It could be bad for the show.

678
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:32,829
I don't think she should be leading
this investigation.

679
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:34,706
I do admit it's a bit extreme.

680
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:36,791
Instead of being the wife
who defends her husband,

681
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:40,587
you want to be the reporter
who uncovers his secrets?

682
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:42,005
This isn't right, sir.

683
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:51,765
I moved out.

684
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:56,311
I need to catch up on work.

685
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:02,692
HARRY JOYCE
NECKLACES

686
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:06,279
I was too busy fighting with him
to notice if he came in with a woman.

687
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:09,783
Is there anything at all
you can remember about her?

688
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,993
Nothing?

689
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:13,161
Not even a little?

690
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:15,121
I serve hundreds of customers every day.

691
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:17,415
You can't expect me to remember everyone.

692
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:23,338
Thank you.

693
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:29,594
Seol must've greased his pockets,
just like you predicted.

694
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:30,595
Clever of him.

695
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:34,057
Go over the footage
from Leaders Palace again.

696
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,142
See if the woman in the red coat shows up.

697
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,853
What? You're going to make me work alone?

698
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,563
GONG DA-HYEON - HAIR MAKEUP DIRECTOR

699
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:43,024
You remember seeing
Cha's bruises and torn lips?

700
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:46,569
Could you check the date for me, please?

701
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,114
Thank you.

702
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,618
Guys, Pastor Kang Man-deok
has been arrested.

703
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:56,412
The fake pastor we uncovered on our show?

704
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:57,956
Was it for sexual assault?

705
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:00,166
No, he was charged with murder.

706
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:03,002
One of his followers was having a seizure,

707
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:05,171
and he neglected to call the cops.

708
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:08,383
God, he's a total psychopath.

709
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:10,927
Someone was dying in front of him,
and he didn't do anything?

710
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,563
Gosh, that cult leader.

711
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:24,232
Seo was furious
he got away without punishment.

712
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:25,775
He'll go to prison at last.

713
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,237
Serves him right, huh?

714
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:35,827
Jeong-won. What's wrong?

715
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:36,995
Are you unwell?

716
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,251
I need to head out for an interview.

717
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:35,053
No. I'm sure Cha Eun-sae was already dead.

718
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:51,819
I had no choice.

719
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:55,573
Once the killer is caught,
I'll tell them myself.

720
00:58:56,157 --> 00:58:57,033
I will.

721
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:05,166
I knew it.

722
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,794
I knew you'd suffer like this all alone.

723
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:13,925
Try to snap out of it, okay?

724
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:15,510
I want to…

725
00:59:17,845 --> 00:59:19,430
but it's harder than I thought.

726
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:25,311
You had a hallucination
and saw blood on your hands?

727
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:29,774
Do you think it had anything to do
with seeing that dead body a month ago?

728
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,444
Yes, I think so.

729
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:38,157
You must be under a lot of stress.

730
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:43,162
I read that article about your husband.

731
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:46,833
I'm really sorry.

732
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:51,379
The day before she died…

733
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:55,300
Cha Eun-sae told me…

734
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:59,137
that she and my husband were in love.

735
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:03,266
-I see.
-That day,

736
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:05,476
I wanted…

737
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:09,939
to kill Cha Eun-sae.

738
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:13,067
First, her death,

739
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:15,278
and now my husband's betrayal…

740
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:20,074
All of this feels like a nightmare.

741
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:23,578
You loved and trusted your husband.

742
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:26,247
That's why this is so painful for you.

743
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:29,000
Before I met him,

744
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:31,961
I was always alone.

745
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:34,547
He became my family,

746
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:35,715
my friend.

747
01:00:36,674 --> 01:00:37,800
No, more than that.

748
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:40,637
I trusted him a lot.

749
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:46,184
I thought he'd always be on my side.

750
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,854
Don't suppress your sadness and anger.

751
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:54,067
It's healthier to express your feelings.

752
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:58,905
He said he never felt loved by me.

753
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:01,324
He said he was lonely.

754
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:03,451
He blamed it all on me.

755
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:05,620
That jerk.

756
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:08,748
I won't suppress it.

757
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:13,002
The pain he caused me, the humiliation,

758
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:15,963
he's going to pay for it.

759
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:54,836
There are small defense wounds on her arm.

760
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:58,005
Cha Eun-sae once told me
she had a sponsor.

761
01:01:58,089 --> 01:01:59,382
Mo Hyeong-taek?

762
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:01,718
They've figured out
where the necklace is from.

763
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:03,177
I only see women's necklaces here.

764
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:04,971
They don't sell men's necklaces?

765
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,723
She told me so herself.

766
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:09,267
She said a lot of people
were trying to kill her,

767
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:11,394
and that one of them was a murderer.

768
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:13,521
It's likely the killer is a woman.

769
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:53,352
Ms. Seo Jeong-won,

770
01:02:54,061 --> 01:02:55,772
I need you to come with me

771
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:57,857
to the police station.

772
01:02:58,649 --> 01:02:59,650
Me? Why?

773
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:01,903
Not my husband?

774
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:03,738
We have some questions for you.

775
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:27,804
Why am I here?

776
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:33,351
Have you seen this before?

777
01:03:36,437 --> 01:03:40,066
I found a picture of you
doing an interview wearing this necklace.

778
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:46,989
I do have the same necklace.

779
01:03:47,573 --> 01:03:49,492
Did you lose it, by any chance?

780
01:03:51,452 --> 01:03:52,620
How do you know that?

781
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:54,997
Because this necklace is yours.

782
01:03:56,874 --> 01:03:57,708
What?

783
01:03:57,792 --> 01:03:59,377
Your necklace was found

784
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:02,004
at the scene where Cha Eun-sae

785
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:04,632
was murdered.

786
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:09,762
Ms. Seo Jeong-won,

787
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:12,640
tell me,

788
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:15,768
were you at the scene of the crime

789
01:04:16,727 --> 01:04:17,687
the day Cha Eun-sae died?
