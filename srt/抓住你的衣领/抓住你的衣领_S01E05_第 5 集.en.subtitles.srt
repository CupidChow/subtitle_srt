1
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:49,340
ALL LOCATIONS, PEOPLE, ORGANIZATIONS,
INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,267
The day Cha Eun-sae was murdered,

3
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,144
the woman who was also
at Seol Woo-jae's studio

4
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,772
went into Leaders Palace
around her time of death.

5
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:07,275
For some reason, your husband's
doing his best to hide her.

6
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,361
DETECTIVE KIM TAE-HEON

7
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,822
In case you'd like to see it.

8
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,673
This woman is Yoo Yun-yeong?

9
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:50,568
You called it a war,

10
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:52,737
didn't you?

11
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,406
Pardon?

12
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,206
MS. SEO JEONG-WON

13
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,960
UNIT 1401 LEADERS PALACE

14
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,628
FOR APPOINTMENT AT 7:20 P.M.

15
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,757
Seo Jeong-won.

16
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,009
SENDING…

17
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,177
YOUR MESSAGE HAS BEEN SENT.

18
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:24,894
It was you?

19
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:27,814
The woman who texted me

20
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:30,275
on October 6th
and told me to come to Unit 1401.

21
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,695
The woman who was with my husband
at his studio that day.

22
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,656
The woman…

23
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,701
he's trying so desperately to hide.

24
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,078
That coat.

25
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,414
Seol Woo-jae bought it for you, right?

26
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,791
What's your relationship with him?

27
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,419
What? I don't understand
what you're talking about.

28
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,173
Cha Eun-sae. You killed her, didn't you?

29
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,885
Answer me. Now!

30
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,772
MY HUSBAND

31
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,736
-Hi.
-Jeong-won.

32
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,280
The foundation's kick-off ceremony
is in two days.

33
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,407
You should attend the event too.

34
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,533
Okay.

35
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,916
Like you said, I am going to war indeed.

36
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,336
I can't help but think of my husband
as my enemy,

37
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,963
and I feel like my home
is my battleground.

38
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,885
See you at the next session.

39
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:01,241
Ms. Seo, I'm really sorry
about the last time.

40
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:04,786
Please call me when you're free.
I want to take you out for a meal.

41
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,037
All right.

42
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:09,832
Thank you.

43
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,335
Have a good day…

44
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,382
BASEMENT 3

45
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,135
You & Me Neuropsychiatric Clinic.

46
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:24,722
They're famous for treating insomnia,
so I made a appointment.

47
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,016
OUR TEAM, YOU AND ME'S EXPERTS
HEAL YOUR HEART

48
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,101
A female doctor?

49
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,894
She's pretty.

50
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,730
In my eyes, this lady here is prettier.

51
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,422
Ms. Choi, how about today?

52
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,258
Gosh.

53
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:04,053
Neither Cha Geum-sae nor Mo Hyeong-taek

54
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,597
were on the security footage
stored at the bar.

55
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,350
Let's recap.

56
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,313
First,

57
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,857
Cha Geum-sae.

58
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,066
He's a gambling addict

59
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,360
and has been physically aggressive
toward his sister.

60
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:22,196
He said he was riding his bike
at the time of her death,

61
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,991
but there's no evidence
that backs up his alibi.

62
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,367
Seol Woo-jae.

63
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:30,079
He was having an affair with Cha Eun-sae,
but he's not the father of the baby,

64
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,956
and his alibi checks out.

65
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,541
Mo Hyeong-taek.

66
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,169
He was rumored
to be Cha Eun-sae's sponsor.

67
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,755
Cha Eun-sae met his aide.

68
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:42,550
We believe Cha Geum-sae
is connected to him. No alibi yet.

69
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,135
And…

70
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,638
Seo Jeong-won.

71
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,933
She met Cha Eun-sae
the day before she died.

72
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:55,063
Her necklace was found at the scene,
and there's a 14-minute gap in her alibi.

73
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:56,856
Lastly,

74
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,525
the woman in the wine-colored coat.

75
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,986
The woman Seol Woo-jae wants to hide.

76
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,529
The day Cha Eun-sae died,

77
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,491
she left his studio
and was seen entering Leaders Palace,

78
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:07,825
hasn't been seen again since.

79
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,619
From her name and face to her age,

80
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,829
we know nothing about her.

81
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,710
There's something between these two,

82
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,588
and the same goes for these two.

83
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,802
These two too.

84
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,639
By the way, how are we
going to find this woman?

85
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,474
I told Seo Jeong-won about her.

86
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:34,936
This is about her husband,
so she'll find her before we do.

87
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,068
Yes.

88
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,195
Sure. All right.

89
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:45,905
Thank you.

90
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,449
Hey, Kim Min-cheol is here.

91
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,243
That guy from the security office?

92
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,628
STATEMENT FORM
KIM MIN-CHEOL

93
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,966
You remember stalking Cha Eun-sae, right?

94
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:06,676
You see, I…

95
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,722
I was rooting for her as a fan.
That's all.

96
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:15,435
You tried to cut off your own finger.
I'd call that grotesque.

97
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,771
And you happened to be patrolling
at the time of her death.

98
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,065
You sneaked into her office too,
didn't you?

99
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,151
Just the corridor.

100
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,363
Yes.

101
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,783
It's all my fault.

102
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,912
I should have patrolled the area
more thoroughly.

103
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,833
She must've felt that it was so unfair.

104
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,210
She couldn't even close her eyes.

105
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:45,840
We haven't told anyone
that she died with her eyes open.

106
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,806
Everyone in the security office
knows about it.

107
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,896
I see here that you went to high school
in Mueon, not in Seoul.

108
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,606
Yes.

109
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:07,069
You're crying because
you clearly liked her very much.

110
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,655
She had an affair with a guy
from the same school.

111
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,493
You must've been really upset
when you read that article.

112
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:21,501
This.

113
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,755
You didn't borrow money.
Didn't you extort money from Seol Woo-jae?

114
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,758
You found out they were having an affair,

115
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,052
so you wanted money
to keep your lips sealed.

116
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,721
No, never.

117
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:37,016
Then again, $10,000 is too little.

118
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:37,934
That's true.

119
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,603
But getting $10,000 monthly
is a lucrative business.

120
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:45,399
If "early October" meant the deadline
for him to pay you, not your deadline.

121
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,610
Like I said, that is not the case!

122
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,618
My gosh.

123
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,372
I feel like I'm about to burst into tears.

124
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,416
So, you're saying

125
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:07,129
your father was stabbed to death
and you found his body.

126
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:09,924
That's horrible.

127
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,842
It must've been traumatizing.

128
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,387
I must be drunk.

129
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,223
I'm telling you all sorts of stuff.

130
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,183
Don't say that.

131
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:23,688
Hearing your stories
makes me feel like we got much closer.

132
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:30,319
Did Cha Eun-sae see Dr. Yoo too?

133
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,404
Yes.

134
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,698
I think

135
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,618
her older brother killed her.

136
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:39,662
I'm positive.

137
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,414
Why do you think so?

138
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:44,792
She told me so a few days before she died.

139
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:48,588
That her brother would beat her to death.

140
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,090
You heard that in person?

141
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,884
You bet I did. Would I make that up?

142
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,972
I bet she told my director all that
during a session.

143
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:03,227
She can't reveal the sessions she filmed.

144
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,063
What did she film?

145
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,398
Dr. Yoo…

146
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,067
she films all her sessions.

147
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,820
You should be careful too.

148
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:15,990
Don't get stabbed in the back like me.

149
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,951
She films all the sessions?

150
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,077
Are you sure?

151
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,996
My head is aching.

152
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,124
I must be drunk.

153
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,549
He said he had never felt loved by me.

154
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:35,635
He said he was lonely.

155
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,679
He blamed it all on me.

156
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,431
That jerk.

157
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,516
I won't suppress it.

158
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:47,688
The pain he gave me, this humiliation.
I'll make sure he gets it all back.

159
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:16,509
-Did you leave your car and take a taxi?
-What's up with you?

160
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:20,888
When your wife left,
she planted a listening device.

161
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,433
She might have put something
on your phone too.

162
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,104
Or in your car.

163
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,073
Yes.

164
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:42,368
I saw it in Eun-sae's office,
and got one because it was my taste.

165
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,121
Your studio.

166
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,665
I rented it as soon as
there was a vacancy.

167
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,250
What are you

168
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:50,793
going to do here?

169
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:58,676
-I'm still thinking.
-Why did my wife plant a listening device?

170
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,849
The day Eun-sae died,

171
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:08,144
Seo Jeong-won knows you went to the scene.

172
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,688
The woman you're hiding.

173
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:12,815
She also knows

174
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,025
I was there.

175
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,155
She played a recording during our session.

176
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,615
She believes you and I
killed Eun-sae together.

177
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:25,870
What if Jeong-won were to find out

178
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:31,250
you sent her to me, and that
we had been close for a long time?

179
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,460
Get it straight.

180
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,589
-I didn't send her to--
-Why did you

181
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,341
get yourself into this
by showing me weakness?

182
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,761
You're not the only one with leverage.
I have something on you too.

183
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,724
Don't you think
you're at a bigger disadvantage?

184
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,770
I regret cheating on my wife,

185
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,565
but I regret even more
that I went to you for help.

186
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,611
I won't go any further.

187
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,030
Somehow I'll get through this.

188
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,909
Forget about the favor I asked last time.

189
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:06,785
I came to say that.

190
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,664
The day Eun-sae died,

191
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,877
she came to me for a session
and there was blood on her sleeve.

192
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,131
What?

193
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,759
If people find out that,

194
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,553
they'd be even more convinced
that Jeong-won's guilty.

195
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,389
What do you think?

196
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,059
Shall we make it so?

197
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,987
When your wife left,
she planted a listening device.

198
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,992
She might have put something
on your phone too.

199
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,245
Or in your car.

200
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,345
My head is aching.

201
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,141
You're awake.

202
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,893
Yes.

203
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:58,355
Sorry. I got so drunk that I blacked out.

204
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:00,941
Do you really

205
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:02,860
not remember anything?

206
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,361
Why?

207
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:05,905
Am I in trouble?

208
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:09,116
You told me about Cha Eun-sae.

209
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:11,452
And about Dr. Yoo.

210
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,537
That she tapes

211
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,957
all the sessions
without the patient's consent.

212
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:20,878
Ms. Seo, that's…

213
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:28,677
I'm working on the case,
and I must ask Dr. Yoo about it.

214
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,803
You can't.

215
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,182
She'll fire me right away.

216
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:37,436
Yesterday, you said something else to me.

217
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,064
That I shouldn't get stabbed
in the back like you.

218
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,359
Darn it. I said all sorts of crap.

219
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:47,404
I don't know what you went through,
but I got stabbed in the back too.

220
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,489
By Dr. Yoo.

221
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,493
If I say I won't go to Dr. Yoo,

222
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,703
will you help me?

223
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,751
What do you need my help with?

224
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,003
The recordings of Cha Eun-sae's sessions,

225
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,923
-are they in the director's office?
-Yes.

226
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,091
Those recordings,

227
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,218
can you get me copies?

228
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,470
I don't think so.

229
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:16,183
Dr. Yoo comes in before I do
and leaves after I clock out.

230
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,894
She even orders lunch and eats in.

231
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,438
She never leaves her office.

232
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,571
-My gosh. What's this?
-Isn't it something?

233
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,492
Was this captured
right before they got into it?

234
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:36,245
It's a killer video.
Don't you want to see it?

235
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,707
Can you go outside
if you want to giggle over tacky photos?

236
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,292
Just so you know,
it's a video, not a photo.

237
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,003
And this is a screenshot.

238
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,129
The two of them…

239
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:49,591
I'm too embarrassed to say,
but it pretty much shows them doing it.

240
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,510
I don't get it.

241
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:54,513
She must have seen this.
Why is she defending her husband?

242
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:57,516
It means the husband and wife
are accomplices.

243
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,395
Do you enjoy insulting a colleague?

244
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,231
We're analyzing the case.

245
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,068
I forgot. You're Jeong-won's hardcore fan.

246
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,362
Are you upset I'm dissing your fave?

247
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,531
You're not dissing her.
You're starting rumors

248
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:13,991
and trying to fake a story.

249
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:15,701
Like a piece of trash.

250
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,786
You're darn rude.

251
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,248
You're starting fights
just like your senior.

252
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,709
A journalist should speak facts.

253
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,920
You're the one who starts fights.

254
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,547
And here's a fact.

255
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,467
The camera flips to the ceiling
so you don't see them do anything.

256
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,094
Why are you so sure
of what's in the video? Did you watch it?

257
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,388
If you don't believe me,

258
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,307
see for yourself.

259
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,779
You don't even have the guts
to play it in my presence.

260
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:55,616
I'm so jealous you have the guts.

261
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,410
So what if you're so gutsy?

262
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,663
You'll never get to run
the Cha Eun-sae story.

263
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,583
You know why our CEO pulled the plug.

264
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,711
It's postponed for now,
but your show's practically canceled.

265
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:16,970
The chief wants our team
to stay here today.

266
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,388
He doesn't want to see us.

267
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,225
Then we can discuss new stories here.

268
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,893
We don't have to.

269
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,561
A month from now, I will report

270
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,605
Cha Eun-sae's case.

271
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,277
The chairman's not in.

272
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:34,571
That's why I'm here.

273
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,335
YOO YUN-YEONG

274
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,005
They knew each other since high school?

275
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,738
Dr. Yoo, it's me.

276
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,365
I have a favor to ask you.

277
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,953
KIM MIN-CHEOL

278
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,166
GRADUATED FROM MUEON HIGH

279
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,462
WITH SEOL WOO-JAE

280
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,131
Mueon?

281
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,896
BIRTH: YESEON-DONG, MUEON-GU, MUEON CITY

282
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,025
-I remembered correctly.
-What is it?

283
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,569
Woo-jae and Min-cheol
graduated from Mueon High School.

284
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,490
-Cha Eun-sae was also from Mueon.
-Really?

285
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,076
That means Cha Geum-sae
is also from Mueon.

286
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,956
PARTY REPRESENTATIVE, FORMER PROSECUTOR
NO OVERDUE WAGES

287
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,673
PASSED THE BAR
WHILE ATTENDING HANKUK UNIVERSITY

288
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,259
WORKED AS A PROSECUTOR
AT MUEON DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

289
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,099
This is interesting.

290
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,477
What's interesting?

291
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,104
I checked just in case.

292
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,982
Mo Hyeong-taek was in Mueon too.

293
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,108
I see.

294
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:20,612
Everyone related to the Cha case
used to live in Mueon?

295
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,827
Everyone but Seo Jeong-won.

296
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,203
THE DAY BEFORE THE MURDER

297
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,622
VISIT CONFIRMED
UNABLE TO CHECK CONTENTS OF ENVELOPE

298
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,377
-Who is it?
-Close the blinds.

299
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:39,881
What brings you here?

300
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,008
Hello.

301
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,885
I'm a reporter from KBM.

302
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,096
My name is Noh Ji-ho.

303
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:51,643
Could I ask you a few questions
about Cha Eun-sae's murder case?

304
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,395
No. You can't ask any questions.

305
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,064
-Tighten security of the room.
-Yes.

306
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,108
Then how about I ask you some questions

307
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:01,903
about your relationship
with Ms. Seo Jeong-won?

308
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,410
You guys had a secret relationship
three years ago.

309
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:09,953
Is that true?

310
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,916
There was no relationship between them.

311
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,376
That's not true. Never.

312
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,544
That's odd.

313
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:20,464
-I heard the reason for your breakup--
-Mr. Noh.

314
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,633
What do you like to drink?

315
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:44,112
You're going to tell me that
you and Ms. Seo never dated, right?

316
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,572
Because we didn't.

317
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:48,867
-Will you say that if I find evidence?
-Isn't that going too far?

318
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:54,581
Would such a relationship
make an interesting article?

319
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:55,957
No, it wouldn't.

320
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,250
But…

321
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,586
what if Seo Jeong-won was the culprit?

322
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:02,089
On top of that,
what if the culprit and the detective

323
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,965
in charge of the case used to date?

324
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,843
Now, that would be interesting. Yes?

325
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,888
You're a reporter
who asks hypothetical questions.

326
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:14,017
It all begins with a hypothetical question
for reporters and detectives.

327
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,602
That brings me to my next question.

328
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:18,772
What's the chance of Ms. Seo
turning out to be the culprit?

329
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:19,898
"100%"

330
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,610
You've already made up your mind.

331
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,989
To give you my precise conclusion,

332
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,326
I figured that Ms. Seo
and her husband are accomplices.

333
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,912
There's a clear motive for murder.

334
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:36,289
Her necklace was found at the crime scene.

335
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:40,252
She's even defending her cheating husband?
That proves my suspicion.

336
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:43,213
I'm sure that's bothering you as well.

337
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,843
I'll run an in-depth investigation
about Cha Eun-sae's murder and air it.

338
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,678
I can count on your cooperation, right?

339
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:51,972
Let's help each other out.

340
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,932
You share information
about the investigation,

341
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:56,101
I won't publicize your relationship
with Ms. Seo.

342
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,227
Have at it.

343
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:01,314
Both of your hypothetical questions
are false.

344
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,485
-Both of them?
-She had nothing to do with me.

345
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:08,238
And she's not the culprit.

346
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:31,136
GRAVE OF SENIOR INSPECTOR CHA JINU

347
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:41,146
CIVIL SERVANT ID CARD, CHA JINU

348
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,487

349
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:51,448
Sir.

350
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:54,784
Sir!

351
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:59,206
Sir, please calm down.

352
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:02,167
I get that he's your partner,
but this is property damage!

353
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,943
-You should hear him out first.
-I can't reach him!

354
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:34,866
Darn it. Tell me what he said.
Who's he meeting?

355
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,201
-I don't know…
-Come on.

356
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:41,373
-I saw that he declined Ms. Seo's call.
-Seo Jeong-won?

357
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,296
Did you locate Detective Cha?

358
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:27,919
Jinu!

359
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,506
Breathe. Come on, breathe!

360
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:32,590
Jinu.

361
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,596
I'm at Gangu Building. A detective fell.

362
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,557
Send an ambulance here. Please hurry.

363
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:44,227
-Jinu. Hey, you--
-I'm sorry for deceiving you.

364
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,355
Seo Jeong-won is deceiving you too.

365
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:49,941
What?

366
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,360
She flirted with you to investigate me.

367
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:56,364
Stop being a fool.

368
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,452
Don't let her use you.

369
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:10,670
Jinu…

370
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,399
Tae-heon.

371
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:38,615
-Is Detective Cha hurt?
-Don't come near.

372
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,078
-He's dead.
-What?

373
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,705
How long have you
been investigating Detective Cha?

374
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:48,416
Why did you hide it from me?

375
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:50,794
He was your partner.

376
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:52,879
How could I tell you?

377
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:55,423
Did you flirt with me
to investigate my partner?

378
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,343
To get a scoop
so you can air it on your show?

379
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:01,262
You said you wanted to date me.

380
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,933
You said you loved me. Was it all a lie?

381
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:07,769
Was it?

382
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,562
-Tae-heon.
-Don't come closer.

383
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:15,693
Get lost.

384
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,822
Get lost, this instant.

385
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,112
I didn't think

386
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:01,781
you'd come here
on my partner's death anniversary.

387
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,075
You should've called me.

388
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,662
We could've reminisced about the old days
on our way here.

389
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:14,586
You have never once apologized to me.

390
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,506
Because I didn't do anything wrong.

391
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:27,849
Have you found the woman
in the wine-colored coat?

392
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:31,144
I hope I don't regret my decision
to leak such confidential info.

393
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:32,395
If I find her,

394
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:35,273
won't it put you at a disadvantage?

395
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:39,110
You need me to remain the prime suspect
to feel like you got your revenge.

396
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,085
How about a game with me?

397
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:24,364
If you'd got into baseball at a young age,
you'd be a major league player now.

398
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:27,951
And if I'd got into fighting
when I was young,

399
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,744
I'd be a thug now. Right?

400
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:37,544
I guess you ran into someone
when you visited Detective Cha.

401
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,588
-Who? Reporter Seo?
-Seriously.

402
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,799
What are you, a mind reader?

403
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:47,387
You know I was more skilled
than mind readers as a detective.

404
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,849
Let's say that I get
why you quit being a detective.

405
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,685
But why did you decide
to work as a secretary for that family?

406
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:54,769
My goodness.

407
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:56,688
Why are you blaming me?

408
00:30:56,771 --> 00:31:01,401
You should blame Seo Jeong-won
for marrying Chairman Seol's son.

409
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:04,737
And before that,
blame yourself for getting betrayed.

410
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,281
My gosh. I can't stand you.

411
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:07,365
You little…

412
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,660
You rebelled like this
when your cigarettes got confiscated.

413
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:12,078
-Come here, you punk.
-Let go!

414
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,373
Let go of me.

415
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,711
My gosh. You haven't aged at all.

416
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,713
-Oh, my.
-Gosh.

417
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:32,140
I did everything in my power
to forget her.

418
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:39,689
And now that you've met her again,
you realized you never forgot her?

419
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,130
What are you going to do?

420
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:09,552
Who's that?

421
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:17,435
I guess it was someone I shouldn't know,
like Cha Eun-sae.

422
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:22,774
Kim Min-cheol.
We went to high school together.

423
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:23,983
I lent him some money.

424
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:27,487
You haven't forgotten about
the kick-off ceremony tomorrow, right?

425
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:31,282
You said you wanted to talk to me
after work. Was it about this?

426
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:33,826
Come with me.

427
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,292
Why?

428
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,461
I saw your shirt that night.

429
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,672
There was blood on it.

430
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,926
Before the articles
about her murder were published,

431
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,680
why did you look her up?

432
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,104
And the night before that,

433
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,857
why did you hurriedly wash
the clothes you wore that day?

434
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:07,944
It wasn't you, was it?

435
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:11,531
Jeong-won.

436
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,242
It wasn't you, right?

437
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,245
Did you do it?

438
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,833
How dare you? You, of all people,

439
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,585
can't ask me if I killed Cha Eun-sae.

440
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:29,924
I looked for the shirt
you tried to wash but couldn't find it.

441
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,344
Don't hide anything.
Tell me the truth, please.

442
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:35,763
"The truth?"

443
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,766
I guess you've already forgotten

444
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,477
that you were the one
who hid the truth, not me.

445
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,274
What's your deal? What is this about?

446
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,484
Are you asking if I stabbed

447
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:52,196
your secret lover
when I heard you were cheating on me?

448
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,782
Do I have to put up
with you treating me like this?

449
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,786
I must know the truth to protect you.

450
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:06,210
I thought I'd tell the police I did it
if they pegged you as the culprit.

451
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,506
If you didn't do it, good.
That's all I wanted to hear.

452
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:15,970
It hurts.

453
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,183
I wanted to hear it from you.

454
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,477
I had to. Only then can I protect you.

455
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:25,688
Are you acting right now?

456
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,232
You're putting on an act right now.

457
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:31,235
Suspecting that I might be the culprit

458
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,113
means you're not the one who did it.

459
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,492
You really are clever.

460
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:38,659
Jeong-won.

461
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,954
-It's not that.
-As you suspect,

462
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:45,166
I could've killed her.

463
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,127
And as I suspect,
you might have hired someone

464
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,129
to kill her.

465
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:52,924
Isn't it interesting?

466
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:57,136
People think we're accomplices,

467
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:58,721
but the two of us

468
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:01,766
suspect each other.

469
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,870
I thought I'd tell the police I did it
if they pegged you as the culprit.

470
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:26,249
If you didn't do it, good.
That's all I wanted to hear.

471
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:31,379
Seo Jeong-won, snap out of it.

472
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,723
The kick-off ceremony
for Mujin Welfare Foundation

473
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,935
established by Mujin's Chairman
Seol Pan-ho will be held today.

474
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:48,980
Chairman Seol's son, Mr. Seol Woo-jae,
has been appointed chairman.

475
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,106
Turn it off, please.

476
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,651
Yes.

477
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,782
The room I used?

478
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:03,161
Okay.

479
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,839
-Jeong-won--
-I searched the room to see

480
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:17,884
if I could find anything
connected to Cha Eun-sae.

481
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:22,180
If I found something,
it would mean you'd lied once again

482
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:23,931
when you told me it wasn't love.

483
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:26,934
But I found nothing.

484
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:33,107
I feel like an idiot…

485
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,069
being happy to hear this.

486
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:41,240
In the past, I thought my love
was one-sided, but you're jealous.

487
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,954
Whether it's love or hatred,
it doesn't matter,

488
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,665
as long as you care about me.

489
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,613
Keep your eyes peeled
for any women looking at Seo Jeong-won.

490
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:22,949
Did we come to find the woman
in the wine-colored coat?

491
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:25,201
Seol Woo-jae and Mo Hyeong-taek
are here too.

492
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:27,203
-Hello.
-Hello.

493
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:29,830
My gosh. Hello.

494
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:31,666
Thank you for coming.

495
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,175
Hello.

496
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,721
Thank you for coming.

497
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,223
Of course, I should be here.

498
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,058
You invited me.

499
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,647
She's my therapist.

500
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,984
She had time between appointments
so I invited her.

501
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,697
Nice to meet you. I'm Yoo Yun-yeong.

502
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:15,835
You're so famous.
I've heard a lot about you.

503
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,421
I feel like I know you already.

504
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,799
I badmouthed you a lot.

505
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,971
I'll make up for all the bad things
I did to her.

506
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,307
You should.

507
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:34,687
You helped me in so many ways.
I'll invite you for dinner one day.

508
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:37,356
-Can I?
-I'd be honored--

509
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,400
I believe it's against medical ethics

510
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:42,069
for a doctor and patient
to meet in private.

511
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:44,196
Am I wrong?

512
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:54,540
No.

513
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:59,587
I'd be honored, but I must refuse.

514
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:06,719
I copied the videos
of Cha Eun-sae's sessions.

515
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,637
They'll be starting soon.

516
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:12,475
-Thanks for coming, Director.
-Sure.

517
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:27,281
Who's that woman?
She looks like Ms. Seo's acquaintance.

518
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,658
Did you get a photo of them?
Send it to me.

519
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,500
You rarely invite someone

520
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:40,002
to events like this.

521
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,548
I invited one more person.

522
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:46,967
Detective Kim Tae-heon?

523
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,807
Until now, Mujin Foundation

524
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:37,017
was devoted to the development

525
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:40,020
of academia, art and society.

526
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,647
Mujin Welfare Foundation

527
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:45,317
aims to generously support
childcare facilities

528
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,653
to improve the plummeting birth rate.

529
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:53,033
We'll do our best to share love
and the blessing of raising kids.

530
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,536
Thank you.

531
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,872
MUJIN WELFARE FOUNDATION LAUNCH

532
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:03,169
Seol Woo-jae, the foundation's
board chairman

533
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:06,046
and his wife Seo Jeong-won
will answer questions.

534
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,136
Thank you for your precious time.

535
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:14,305
Yes, you.

536
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:16,891
You have kept your distance
from business so far.

537
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,101
Do you plan to continue writing?

538
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:23,439
No, in order to focus
on running the welfare foundation,

539
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:26,025
I will no longer write.

540
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:29,361
Ms. Seo, how do you feel
about your husband's decision?

541
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:37,161
As his wife, I always respect
and support his decisions.

542
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:42,458
It looks like your marriage
is even stronger after the recent storm.

543
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:46,962
You set up a welfare foundation
to contribute to raising the birth rate.

544
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:49,507
Do you plan to be parents?

545
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:53,177
I can't help but wonder.
Could you please answer?

546
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:59,350
It's a shame you asked
an unsuitable question, Mr. Noh.

547
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:01,852
You seem to have misunderstood
my intention.

548
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:04,772
If you were going to ask
an unsuitable question,

549
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:07,441
you should've asked
what people really want to know.

550
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:17,743
Rather than if we'll be parents,

551
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:20,496
you want to know
if I'll cover Cha Eun-sae's death

552
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:23,415
on my show Nothing Uncovered.

553
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:29,129
You do have a point.

554
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,965
Everyone thinks Seo Jeong-won

555
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:35,052
and her husband are connected
to Cha Eun-sae's death.

556
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,137
I might as well ask you now.

557
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,682
As a journalist
who's more impartial than anyone,

558
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:43,185
will you explain on air that neither you
nor your husband are guilty?

559
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,188
I won't just explain it.

560
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,483
I'll run an exclusive show.

561
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:55,823
I obtained previously unknown proof
that Cha was assaulted

562
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:57,908
before she died.

563
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:02,329
A few days before she died,
someone heard her say

564
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,957
her brother would beat her to death.

565
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,084
I spoke to a witness.

566
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:17,011
I'll follow every lead without giving up,

567
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,805
and a month from now, I'll reveal

568
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:23,183
who killed Cha Eun-sae on my show.

569
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:50,628
Darn it.

570
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,632
She invited me in her husband's name
to do this?

571
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:56,634
Screw her.

572
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:01,013
Darn it.

573
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:05,184
-You're running for office?
-Yes.

574
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:07,853
Good luck. Do help our foundation.

575
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:10,064
Congratulations.

576
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,732
I hope we can help each other.

577
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:25,913
Ms. Seo.

578
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:30,668
Do you really have proof and a statement
that Cha Geum-sae assaulted Cha Eun-sae?

579
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:32,670
Why are you here?

580
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,394
I'll get some proof and get back at her.

581
00:44:57,319 --> 00:45:00,697
EXHIBITION ROOM: BOMBOM 3

582
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:18,382
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

583
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,949
-What?
-Talk to me before my husband.

584
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,295
SUPPLY ROOM

585
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:21,904
Shoot.

586
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:29,786
You wanted to talk to me.

587
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:33,332
Reporter No was following you.
He was filming you too.

588
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:42,216
He came over yesterday
and asked if you and I dated in secret.

589
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,675
-So what?
-We did.

590
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:44,885
You said we did?

591
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,808
It's in the past, and it's no big deal.

592
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:58,232
What was not a big deal
could become a scoop,

593
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:01,693
if we're reunited as a detective
and culprit.

594
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:04,947
You're openly calling me the culprit now.

595
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:12,663
Convince me.
Why did you let Seol Woo-jae off?

596
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:14,831
Why are you trying so hard to defend him?

597
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,543
Why aren't you accomplices?

598
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:25,842
You know me, don't you?

599
00:47:28,845 --> 00:47:31,098
Jeong-won played me yet again.

600
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:33,392
Isn't she something?

601
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:34,977
She wrapped things up

602
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,437
by announcing
she'd name the killer on her show.

603
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,859
She says she'll do it for Cha Eun-sae,

604
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:44,570
but it's a defense mechanism.

605
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:47,281
She's flailing to somehow

606
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:50,576
keep your riches, honor
and reputation intact.

607
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:53,370
More than anything,

608
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:57,416
she wants to keep
the spirit of journalism intact.

609
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:03,964
She's such a man magnet.
That hasn't changed about her.

610
00:48:04,881 --> 00:48:06,341
Are you looking for her?

611
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:08,760
I saw her walking around
till a moment ago.

612
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:10,971
Then poof, she vanished into thin air.

613
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:13,765
Is she hiding somewhere?

614
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,522
SUPPLY ROOM

615
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:36,913
I'm a detective. I'm on official business.
Could you make sure people don't enter?

616
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:39,166
I see. Okay.

617
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:49,509
Anyway, after what happened today,

618
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:52,638
I realized once again
how sly she could be.

619
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:53,805
Well,

620
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,600
she can't be as sly as you.

621
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:59,436
You've been staring at it this whole time.

622
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:03,148
Do you want it?
Should I give it to you? Yes?

623
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:09,196
But under one condition.

624
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:12,741
You just insulted my wife.
Apologize right now.

625
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:14,576
Then it's yours.

626
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:25,462
I'll be watching you too.

627
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,846
Do we have extra pamphlets
in the supply room?

628
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:39,142
A police officer is in there.
He said he was on official business.

629
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:42,145
-A police officer?
-Yes.

630
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:59,705
If you weren't trying to convince me,
why did you want to see me?

631
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:02,999
You leaked information
about the woman in the wine-colored coat.

632
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:05,168
Did you tell my husband about that?

633
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:10,090
-Don't tell him I know.
-Why should I do what you ask?

634
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:13,093
Don't you think I would find her faster
if he lowered his guard?

635
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:16,179
-Maybe you've already found her.
-I could accuse you of the same.

636
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:19,933
-Are you making a fool out of me?
-Just like you made a fool out of me?

637
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:22,978
Detective Kim,

638
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:27,315
you make it sound like
you know everything about me

639
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:28,775
when you know nothing.

640
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:35,407
Mr. Noh might still be outside.

641
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:01,933
You can come out.

642
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:40,555
I think you're here
to talk about Min-cheol.

643
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:42,891
Let's meet on the rooftop.

644
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,731
I lent him a mere $10,000.

645
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:53,109
But you tried to use that

646
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:55,821
to accuse me and Min-cheol
of a ridiculous crime.

647
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:58,198
The money didn't come
with strings attached,

648
00:51:58,281 --> 00:51:59,991
so the money you gave Kim Min-cheol

649
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:02,202
has nothing to do
with Cha Eun-sae's murder.

650
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:04,830
I'm sure you guys got your story straight.

651
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:06,540
You have so many people to hide.

652
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,083
Women…

653
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:10,710
and school friends.

654
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:21,680
Ms. Seo had this same coat.

655
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:27,352
Did you buy the coats at the same time?
For your wife and this woman?

656
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:32,858
How did you know
that my wife had that coat?

657
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:39,739
I saw her in it when she came
to the station to investigate her story.

658
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:43,910
You can remember
what my wife wore to the police station.

659
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:47,080
You have…

660
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:49,833
a lot of interest in my wife.

661
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,167
Naturally.

662
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:55,755
Your wife's necklace was found
at the scene of Cha Eun-sae's murder.

663
00:52:56,756 --> 00:53:00,677
Come to think of it, both Cha Eun-sae
and Ms. Seo had the same necklaces.

664
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,805
Shouldn't you tell me the truth

665
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:06,182
about this woman
before your wife finds out?

666
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:12,439
Suit yourself.

667
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,984
You can try all you want,
but that won't make me the culprit.

668
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:18,570
Do you have anything else to say to me?

669
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:24,284
You graduated from Mueon High School.

670
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:27,370
Cha Eun-sae was born in Mueon too.

671
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:31,166
Did you guys know each other
when you lived in Mueon?

672
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:36,296
Gosh. Seriously.

673
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:40,759
Did you seriously ask me that?

674
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:42,594
It's odd to call it a coincidence.

675
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:44,888
Along with the victim, Cha Eun-sae,

676
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:46,973
everyone related to the case

677
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:48,642
is from

678
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:50,393
Mueon.

679
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:54,189
Did something happen there?

680
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:01,237
Yes.

681
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:03,114
Okay.

682
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:11,498
You know what? I've asked you

683
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:14,125
numerous uncomfortable questions
during our talks,

684
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:17,128
but you've never ended
our conversations first, not once.

685
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:22,175
See? You're acting different today.

686
00:54:22,258 --> 00:54:24,344
I guess there's something about Mueon.

687
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:29,099
-Let go of me.
-I'm not done talking to you.

688
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:31,101
I told you to let go of me.

689
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:33,353
I told you to let go.

690
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:36,356
You…

691
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,109
You picked the wrong guy to mess with.

692
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:43,738
Why does it feel good to see

693
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:45,573
you lose your temper?

694
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:49,077
You crazy jerk.

695
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:52,497
I agree that I'm a crazy jerk.
But what about you?

696
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,208
Do you agree that you are…

697
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:57,544
a psychopath?

698
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:01,715
It's crystal clear to me
that you're a guilty man.

699
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:05,468
You're reeking of a rotten smell,
like a criminal.

700
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:13,309
That's dangerous.

701
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:15,562
Do you want there to be another article?

702
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,440
Stop that before someone sees you.

703
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:47,135
It's odd to call it a coincidence.

704
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:49,179
Along with the victim, Cha Eun-sae,

705
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:51,806
everyone related to the case
is from Mueon.

706
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:55,643
Did something happen there?

707
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:59,272
See? You're acting different today.

708
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:01,608
I guess there's something about Mueon.

709
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:07,489
He clearly said,
"everyone related to the case."

710
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:10,325
Who else is related to the case?

711
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:14,079
Why did my husband get worked up
by that question?

712
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,927
You'll need this
for your comeback episode.

713
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:31,805
It has photos of the assault
and the medical certificate file.

714
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:35,141
Cha Eun-sae asked me to
hold on to them when she was alive.

715
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:38,186
Earlier today…

716
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:40,855
Thank you for attending the launch party

717
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,649
regardless of the reason you had.

718
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:53,243
Ms. Seo, I just sent you
the USB flash drive via courier.

719
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:54,661
EUN-SAE'S COUNSELING VIDEOS

720
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:58,164
Have you been well?

721
00:56:58,873 --> 00:57:00,583
How are you doing these days?

722
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:02,085
Have you been sleeping well?

723
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:05,505
You seem a little tired.

724
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,215
Well…

725
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:10,927
PLANT MANAGER AND PRIME SUSPECT
OF BONGTO CHEMICAL PLANT FIRE FOUND DEAD

726
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,513
So, you're saying
Jin Myeong-suk's ex-husband

727
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,473
was the victim in the chemical plant fire?

728
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:18,476
The victim and the accused in the case.

729
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:21,521
The manager of the plant who died
was indicted.

730
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:25,400
I see. That's why there was
this article about that fire

731
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:27,694
on the first page of her scrapbook.

732
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:31,614
All the other articles were about Mo,
so I thought it was odd.

733
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:35,827
Jin Myeong-suk approached
Mo Hyeong-taek's family deliberately.

734
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:38,288
The prosecutor in charge of the case was…

735
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:39,497
MO HYEONG-TAEK

736
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:41,207
It was none other than Mo Hyeong-taek.

737
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,333
My gosh.

738
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:45,462
So, in addition to those linked
to Cha Eun-sae's case,

739
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:51,259
Jin Myeong-suk is also connected
to Mueon somehow.

740
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:55,221
CHA EUN-SAE MURDER CASE
OCTOBER 6, 2023

741
00:57:57,515 --> 00:57:58,641
By any chance,

742
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:03,104
do you know Na-ri?

743
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:05,607
"Na-ri?"

744
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:10,236
By any chance,

745
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:12,780
do you know Na-ri?

746
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:16,576
Na-ri?

747
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:21,789
You said you and Woo-jae
went to the same high school.

748
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,375
Do you know someone named Na-ri?

749
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:27,545
Why do you ask?

750
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:30,965
Yesterday, I went to his studio.

751
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:34,552
He fell asleep
after drinking a bottle of liquor.

752
00:58:35,136 --> 00:58:37,138
He whimpered and groaned in his sleep,

753
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:38,890
and suddenly said that name

754
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:40,975
while shedding tears.

755
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,478
He cried?

756
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:44,812
The truth is,

757
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:49,359
I once heard him say
something very shocking in his sleep.

758
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:51,945
What did he say?

759
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:54,155
That I can't tell you.

760
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:59,410
I'm going to do some digging
and find out who this woman is.

761
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:04,707
This "Na-ri" can't be a guy, right?

762
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:19,430
Cha Eun-sae knew that Yoo Yun-yeong
and my husband went to the same school,

763
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:24,602
and Yoo Yun-yeong knew that Cha Eun-sae
was having an affair with him.

764
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:27,522
Who is Na-ri, then?

765
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,238
ALBUM 1

766
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:41,703
MUEON HIGH SCHOOL FESTIVAL

767
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:04,684
This station is Mueon. Mueon Station.

768
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:07,312
The doors are on your right.

769
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:48,121
Who are you?

770
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:50,581
Who are you? What do you want?

771
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:40,631
Why are you here?

772
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:43,134
What are you after?
Why did you come to Mueon?

773
01:02:43,217 --> 01:02:45,720
Is she Na-ri?

774
01:02:45,803 --> 01:02:47,305
Yoo Yun-yeong, this woman…

775
01:02:47,388 --> 01:02:50,099
So, she knew Seol Woo-jae personally,
not Seo Jeong-won?

776
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:52,185
Yun-yeong, I consider you a good friend.

777
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:54,604
To me, you're a jerk I want to kill.

778
01:02:54,687 --> 01:02:57,356
It was one of the victim's belongings
found at the scene.

779
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,066
Was there no battery in this watch?

780
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:01,778
Why a stopped clock?

781
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:04,030
Why are you angry
that I ignored my husband's affair?

782
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:06,616
You're doing a background check
on your cheating husband.

783
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:08,201
Anyone would think it's suspicious.

784
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:10,578
Look into Detective Kim Tae-heon.

785
01:03:10,661 --> 01:03:12,705
Everything about him
from his family to his finances

786
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,290
and his past relationships.

787
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:18,461
I'm annoyed that we met again.

788
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:19,629
And…
