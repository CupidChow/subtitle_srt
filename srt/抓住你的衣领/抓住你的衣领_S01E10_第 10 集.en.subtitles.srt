1
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:49,424
ALL LOCATIONS, PEOPLE, ORGANIZATIONS,
INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:14,115
The photos Yoo Yun-yeong gave you
were screenshots of this footage, right?

3
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,533
You fool.

4
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:16,868
You're a police detective.

5
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:19,913
You concealed evidence and lied
to your colleagues because of a woman!

6
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:22,957
Captain, one moment.
Let's check if it was manipulated--

7
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,752
You think I didn't check
before showing it to you guys?

8
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:29,255
From now on, hands off this case.
Return everything!

9
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,389
CIVIL SERVANT ID CARD

10
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:43,728
We'll search Seo Jeong-won's home
and office, so come with me.

11
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:44,896
You little…

12
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,569
I'll call you.

13
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:10,130
You have the right to remain silent
and the right to retain an attorney.

14
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:14,801
You're arresting her for murder?
You can't do this without evidence.

15
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:19,973
We've secured some video footage
where Ms. Seo fled a murder scene.

16
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,308
Please come with us.

17
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:35,655
I'll send Mr. Moon, the lawyer.
I'll get you out, no matter what.

18
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,546
GANGHA POLICE STATION

19
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:56,092
They released me
because Jeong-won's been arrested, right?

20
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:00,430
See? I was right. Jeong-won did it.

21
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,267
Anyway, Detective Kim,

22
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,270
I heard you were no longer on the case.

23
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,731
What did you do wrong?

24
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,736
Was the article about you and Jeong-won
having an affair actually true?

25
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:18,239
Or did you deliberately hide the photos
of Jeong-won I gave you?

26
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,576
So that's what you did.

27
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:23,912
My goodness.

28
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:27,415
How much do you love her
to have gone that far?

29
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,043
I trusted her.

30
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:33,713
It sounds like

31
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,217
you feel betrayed now
because you trusted her.

32
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,890
A car's coming in. Please step back.

33
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,183
Step back, please.

34
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,685
Was it premeditated?

35
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,687
-Was it planned?
-Is it true?

36
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,981
-How did it happen?
-Why did you kill her?

37
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,901
-Just a comment, please!
-Was it premeditated?

38
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,822
Is it true that you were at the scene
the day Cha Eun-sae was murdered?

39
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,493
You denied it
when the police interviewed you initially.

40
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:07,288
Just like in the Jin Myeong-suk case,
you saw the victim, right?

41
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,583
Did you do more than just witness it?
Did you kill her?

42
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,044
-Please step aside.
-Are you really the killer?

43
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,796
-Step aside.
-Why did you do it?

44
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,464
Why did you go there?

45
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,132
-A comment, please.
-Step back!

46
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,342
-Ms. Seo!
-Look here!

47
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:38,046
REPORTER SEO JEONG-WON ARRESTED
ON SUSPICION OF MURDERING CHA EUN-SAE

48
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:49,307
-You sent Mr. Moon to her.
-Mr. Moon can't get her out on his own.

49
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,392
Please help her get released.

50
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,523
She entered the scene, but that's it.

51
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:00,359
-It wasn't Jeong-won--
-Even if it was Yoo Yun-yeong,

52
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:03,196
they let her go after the interview.
We're back to square one.

53
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,367
Even if we can't
put Yun-yeong behind bars,

54
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:11,120
please get Jeong-won released.
I know you can, Father.

55
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,790
How? With my money,
which you've belittled?

56
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:14,874
Or with my power?

57
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:20,505
Public opinion can render money
and power completely useless.

58
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:24,092
All eyes are on this case at the moment,
so no one can intervene.

59
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:28,638
If the situation doesn't change,
I'll take a hit too.

60
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,225
Whether she's my daughter-in-law

61
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,727
or my business partner's daughter,

62
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:40,525
no matter how strong the Queen is,
it's all over once the King gets caught.

63
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,945
So you should help me
instead of asking me for help.

64
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:48,699
The one who planned the murder
may be able to get out of this,

65
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,620
but not the person
who has blood on their hands.

66
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,129
We must catch the real culprit.

67
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,298
We must catch Mo Soo-rin.

68
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,425
Find out everything you can

69
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,177
about her.

70
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,058
MUJIN WELFARE FOUNDATION

71
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,648
My innocence has been proved,
so I'm here to celebrate.

72
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:22,442
Such good news, right?

73
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,360
My wife got arrested because of you.

74
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,195
How dare you come here?

75
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,699
Your wife got arrested
because she killed Cha Eun-sae.

76
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:32,243
Why blame it on me?

77
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:33,661
You instigated the murder,

78
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,122
left the necklace at the scene,

79
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,332
and even recorded the video
using spy cams.

80
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,213
This is all my fault.

81
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,634
First, Lee Na-ri, then, Cha Eun-sae.

82
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,637
Now, Jeong-won too.

83
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,351
You should've just killed me.

84
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,855
Why didn't you just kill me and quit?

85
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,236
You're finished
once Mo Soo-rin gets caught.

86
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,448
I know you got her to kill Eun-sae.

87
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,742
I will track her down at all costs

88
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,454
and make you pay for what you did.

89
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,081
How will you do that?

90
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,001
Do you have evidence?

91
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,589
Want to hear something interesting?

92
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:29,467
Even if your delusion were true,

93
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,510
I will never

94
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,012
have to pay for it.

95
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:34,597
Never.

96
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,190
Even if there's no evidence
to prove it was you,

97
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,609
once Mo Soo-rin gets caught,

98
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,363
will she keep her lips sealed?

99
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,782
She'll have to confess.

100
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:54,867
You really think so?

101
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,953
How are you so sure she won't?

102
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,705
You must have something on her.

103
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,166
Do you?

104
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,378
You don't seem to want to congratulate me.

105
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:07,838
I should go.

106
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,225
If that's true,

107
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,186
let's put away just her.

108
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,486
Please

109
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,197
get Jeong-won released.

110
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,034
You'll be safe
even if Mo Soo-rin is arrested.

111
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,870
If you let Jeong-won come out,

112
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,163
I'll do anything.

113
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,045
Then…

114
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,089
will you divorce her

115
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,677
and marry me?

116
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,311
ASSEMBLYMAN MO HYEONG-TAEK

117
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,690
THIS IS WHY REPORTERS ARE TRASH.

118
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,652
I'm glad you have
a little less on your plate.

119
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,904
We can't relax
until prosecutors charge her.

120
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,490
NEW UNION PARTY

121
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,827
-What's the approval rating?
-We're six percent points ahead.

122
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:21,787
For each region--

123
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,248
What if a chairman's son's wife
is a murderer?

124
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,211
The second Mujin resort complex
they were planning,

125
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,588
that would flop, right?

126
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:35,509
They would divorce quickly,
then wait for the commotion to die down.

127
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,762
I can't wait until then.

128
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,058
Bring me a list of companies

129
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,854
with construction subsidiaries
that are easy to control.

130
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,064
This matter is

131
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,859
more important to me
than approval ratings.

132
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,541
What are you thinking about?

133
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,626
Sorry.

134
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,130
I was thinking

135
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:17,635
I wouldn't be able
to have your coffee for a while.

136
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,057
What time do you leave tomorrow?

137
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,308
At 11:00 a.m.

138
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,977
When can you come over?

139
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,439
Jeong-won must be charged first.

140
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,234
Then I'll see how things go.

141
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,414
Is it for me?

142
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:49,125
Keep it on Korean time and think of me.

143
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,920
I'll keep mine on Malta time
and think of you.

144
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,931
We can live together at last.

145
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,476
If it wasn't for you,

146
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:11,313
I could never have left
that dreadful house.

147
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,575
Soo-rin…

148
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,953
I need you to do something
before you leave.

149
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:31,000
The cameras at the memorial hall
where Jeong-won's dad's ashes are,

150
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,711
they'll be out of order this week.

151
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:37,631
Maintenance checks the place once a week,
so they're mostly overlooked.

152
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:38,757
The knife,

153
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,926
hide it with the ashes.

154
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,763
They must find the murder weapon
if they're to charge her.

155
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:49,727
I was just released from lockup,
so I can't do it myself.

156
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:50,936
You understand, right?

157
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,021
Yes.

158
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,273
But…

159
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:59,445
Jeong-won mentioned an accomplice
during her news interview.

160
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,326
That won't do.

161
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,621
I must do it myself, to execute the plan.

162
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,039
No, that's too dangerous.

163
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:17,838
Okay,

164
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:19,924
I'll do it.

165
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:23,761
Thanks, Soo-rin.

166
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:28,766
You're all I have.

167
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:41,612
Tae-heon.

168
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:43,614
Hey.

169
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,911
The video of Ms. Seo at the scene
was sent by courier anonymously.

170
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:53,165
They found blood
on the shoes she wore in the video.

171
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,376
-Cha Eun-sae's blood?
-Yes.

172
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,923
Captain's putting crazy pressure
to find the murder weapon.

173
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,552
What about what I asked?

174
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,387
You were right about that.

175
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,267
When and where is she headed?

176
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,936
She's flying to New York
at 11:00 a.m. tomorrow.

177
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:18,065
You know you'll lose your job
if you do anything else, right?

178
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:23,153
Then I'll spend the rest of my life
on a batting range or driving range.

179
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,197
Are you insane?

180
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,621
Hello, Captain.

181
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,377
I'm with him now. Why?

182
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,879
Can he come back to work?

183
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,473
Goodness.

184
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,151
I got nothing on you
in the last inspection,

185
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,153
and it left a bad taste in my mouth.

186
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,947
You scored big this time.

187
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,991
I'm a bit busy right now.

188
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,452
Can we do this tomorrow?

189
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,621
I'm sorry you're busy.

190
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:16,165
I plan to keep you here tonight.

191
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,503
Let's begin.

192
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,227
When did you decide to kill Cha Eun-sae?

193
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,856
I never decided

194
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,900
to kill Cha Eun-sae.

195
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:45,986
I didn't kill her.

196
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:47,947
I just read the news.

197
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:51,784
Alongside a report
saying your show got canceled,

198
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:54,453
I found one that said
the journalist association

199
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,080
wants your membership revoked.

200
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:04,088
As a journalist, don't you want
to do what's right in the end?

201
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,840
Let's not drag this out.

202
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:08,634
Please confess.

203
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,275
NEW TEXT MESSAGE
SEOL WOO-JAE

204
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,292
A journalist's conscience
shows in their article,

205
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:45,838
and a politician's conscience
shows in their actions.

206
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:47,965
We must not forget that.

207
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,633
-Good job.
-Well done.

208
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,385
-Great work.
-Thanks.

209
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,803
-You did well.
-Thank you.

210
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:53,929
Good job.

211
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,852
The two of you
who might be watching right now

212
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,563
must know the answer
to all these questions.

213
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,525
Please cooperate with the police

214
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:10,279
and tell them the truth.

215
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:49,276
I don't mind being locked up,
but at least let me pee.

216
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,360
Okay.

217
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,205
Don't be like this.

218
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:06,627
Did you have to go and hold back evidence
and get in trouble?

219
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:11,548
-Don't you do that.
-Tae-heon!

220
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:12,716
Darn it.

221
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,637
Hey.

222
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,139
You… Where are you going?

223
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,475
-Tae-heon.
-Tae-heon!

224
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,063
Kim Tae-heon, stop right there!

MARRIAGE REGISTRATION

229
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,665
WIFE: YOO YUN-YEONG

230
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:48,687
You're home.

231
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,439
-What are you doing?
-What?

232
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,192
Once we register our marriage,

233
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,860
I'll move in here with you.

234
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:58,739
Get out.

235
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,049

MARRIAGE REGISTRATION

237
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,429
-If Jeong-won doesn't divorce me--
-She will.

238
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:25,182
Once she finds out
you're officially married to me.

239
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,311
Besides, it seems

240
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,648
your wife already fell for Detective Kim.

241
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,526
I guess I was right.

242
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,694
Get changed.

243
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:39,571
Let me drive you home.

244
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:40,739
I want to sleep over.

245
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,762
Did you know it's my birthday today?

246
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,436
I don't want us to be disturbed,
so I'll turn it off.

247
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,649
DO YOU WANT TO INSTALL THIS APPLICATION?

248
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:16,942
INSTALLING

249
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:49,141
It's just the two of us
together on my birthday

250
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,435
for the first time.

251
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,451
Yun-yeong…

252
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,045
Don't you dare reject me again.

253
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:00,670
I'm sorry.

254
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:04,424
I am sorry.

255
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:37,457
OUR DEEPEST CONDOLENCES

256
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:56,184
THE LATE SEO SANG-GYEON

257
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:43,064
She still had the shoes she wore that day.

258
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,858
It means she still has the weapon.

259
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:48,695
Look into the places she visited,
so we can figure out where she hid it.

260
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:51,865
In most cases,
it's usually the culprit's parents' place.

261
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,366
But her parents passed away.

262
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,579
I remember her mentioning it on her show

263
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,664
that her father was also a reporter.

264
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:02,751
DATE, LOCATION

265
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,669
YUNPYEONG MEMORIAL PARK

266
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,838
She went to the columbarium two weeks ago.

267
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,351
We're the police.
We need to check something.

268
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,245
Did you find something?

269
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:35,719
Let's request
an arrest warrant for Seo now.

270
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:38,179
How about arresting her
without a warrant first?

271
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,264
Tae-heon.

272
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:42,017
You…

273
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,061
You ran from interrogation yesterday.
How dare you show up here?

274
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,605
Besides, Seo Jeong-won
is already in holding.

275
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,317
What do you mean,
arrest her without warrant?

276
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,861
Jeez, have you lost your mind?

277
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,160
What…

278
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:05,790
ONE DAY AGO

279
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:06,916
NO SIGNAL

280
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:08,918
How about now?

281
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:10,503
How is it now?

282
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,213
Good. The cameras are up now.

283
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:44,204
The woman in the video is Mo Soo-rin.

284
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:46,247
I witnessed it myself.

285
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,374
Really?

286
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,585
You'll reinstate him immediately, right?

287
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,214
Your stuff is on my desk.

288
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,841
We'll catch Mo Soo-rin, so…

289
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,259
I've already retrieved it.

290
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,220
When did you take that?

291
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:04,641
Yes.

292
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,435
Okay.

293
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:19,948
Keep it on Korean time and think of me.

294
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:24,077
I'll keep mine on Malta time
and think of you.

295
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:29,749
Go that way.

296
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,343
YUN-YEONG

297
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:46,641
Alpha Airline passengers
departing for New York

298
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,393
will now begin boarding.

299
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:51,354
Priority boarding is
for passengers with disabilities,

300
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,940
those traveling with children,
and Alpha Platinum members.

301
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:55,942
You may begin boarding now.

302
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,209
Finally, we meet, Ms. Mo Soo-rin.

303
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,004
You're under arrest

304
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,631
for the murder of Cha Eun-sae.

305
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,465
Have they issued

306
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:02,634
an arrest warrant for me?

307
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:07,138
No, it wasn't me.

308
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,058
I swear, it wasn't me.

309
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,354
Yes, I know it wasn't you.

310
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,320
Let's get out of here.

311
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,667
CALLING YOO YUN-YEONG

312
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,674
DETECTIVE KIM TAE-HEON

313
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,844
-Yes.
-We've arrested Mo Soo-rin.

314
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,681
-What about Jeong-won?
-She'll be released soon.

315
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:02,277
I thought about it and realized

316
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,238
I'd never invited you to my place before.

317
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,824
You visited my office so often

318
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:10,577
when I was at
the Mueon District Prosecutors' Office.

319
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,329
At some point,

320
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,915
I began to just accept

321
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,711
that I had to follow you around.

322
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:22,380
I guess it's been bothering you a lot.

323
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:31,514
You see, this is what really bothers me.

324
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,851
Your daughter-in-law got arrested,

325
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,687
and she'll be charged soon.

326
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,276
So I was wondering,
"Why hasn't he reached out?"

327
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,361
"How come he's not even calling me?"

328
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,452
The plan to build the second Mujin resort
has gone down the drain.

329
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:56,456
You're not the type
to just neglect a situation like this.

330
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,625
What's your plan?

331
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:02,128
Since we're partners, you need to
at least give me a heads-up.

332
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:03,963
Assemblyman Mo,

333
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,841
you asked me the very question
I wanted ask.

334
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:11,387
Do you know why you had to accept
that you should follow me around?

335
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,973
You're always one step behind me,

336
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,434
in terms of information
and handling situations.

337
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:23,358
Sir, the cops are here.
They're asking to be let in.

338
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,068
What should I do?

339
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:28,821
Your daughter just got arrested,
so they must be here to search your home.

340
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,200
Now what will you do?

341
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,870
Since we're partners,
you need to at least give me a heads-up.

342
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:03,982
Have this instead of tofu. It's white too.

343
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,996
-What's going on with Mo Soo-rin?
-They'll start interviewing her.

344
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:25,211
Even if Mo Soo-rin did it,
Yoo was the mastermind behind everything.

345
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:26,879
I'll put them both behind bars,

346
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:28,756
so just trust me.

347
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,593
I never once doubted

348
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,680
that you would save me.

349
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:43,396
In the holding cell,

350
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:46,733
this thought hit me for the first time.

351
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:51,362
"Thank goodness Dad passed away."

352
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,073
"If he were alive,

353
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:57,910
he'd be so heartbroken now."

354
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:03,958
"Why did you run away?"

355
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,419
"Why did you lie?"

356
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,840
"This serves you right, Seo Jeong-won."

357
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:15,470
"You didn't kill her,

358
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,598
but you just left
after seeing her dead body."

359
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:24,187
"Even if I end up in jail,
I must deal with it."

360
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,606
I kept telling myself this.

361
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:29,776
But even so…

362
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,573
I didn't want to spend
the rest of my life as a murderer.

363
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,702
"I want to just follow Dad and die."

364
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,164
I even thought that.

365
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:49,045
Thanks for saving me

366
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,465
and keeping me from falling apart.

367
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:59,013
I didn't do it alone.

368
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:03,267
Your husband gave me a hint
about Mo Soo-rin.

369
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,562
For a moment, I was torn.

370
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,816
"Should I not tell her?"

371
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,736
"I don't want to tell her."

372
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:23,371
Jeong-won,

373
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:25,915
if you fall apart,

374
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,501
I'll fall apart even more.

375
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,173
Never have such thoughts again, ever.

376
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:35,967
Okay?

377
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:44,725
There are a lot of reporters outside,
so wait until dawn and leave then.

378
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:46,978
No.

379
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:48,646
I'll leave now.

380
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,320
-Here she comes!
-It's Seo Jeong-won!

381
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,738
-She's here!
-It's her.

382
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,574
-Seo is here.
-Get her on camera.

383
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:07,915
I'm aware that
I caused you concern and disappointment.

384
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,501
I'm truly sorry.

385
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,714
Your relationship
with the suspect arrested today?

386
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:17,258
Rumor has it that you hired a hitman.
Is it true?

387
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:20,928
Did Mujin Group really pressure
the police to release you?

388
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:24,348
Goodness.
Let's not be so crude, all right?

389
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:29,687
This is exactly why people
call you reporters trash.

390
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,439
-What?
-Aren't you a reporter too?

391
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:32,523
What's his problem?

392
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:33,441
What's with him?

393
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,067
-What's his problem?
-Seriously.

394
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:38,404
Why did the police arrest you
on suspicion of killing Cha Eun-sae?

395
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:41,657
It was because

396
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,703
they found evidence that I fled the scene

397
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:50,041
upon discovering Cha Eun-sae's dead body.

398
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:57,173
When you found
Mo Hyeong-taek's housekeeper's body,

399
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,341
you called it in.

400
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:01,177
So why didn't you do the same
when you found Cha's body?

401
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,345
Why did you flee?

402
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,888
When I was about to call the police,

403
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,308
I heard that they had chosen me

404
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:09,810
to anchor the nine o'clock news.

405
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,146
The day before that, Cha told me

406
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,317
she was having an affair with my husband,

407
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:20,404
so I didn't want to be associated
with the murder scene.

408
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:26,244
It was irresponsible of me.

409
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,329
I was foolish.

410
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,706
It was a cowardly decision.

411
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:33,709
I'd like to sincerely apologize
to Cha Eun-sae

412
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,631
and her bereaved family.

413
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:56,482
I'll remember my mistakes
for the rest of my life.

414
00:37:58,609 --> 00:37:59,694
And finally,

415
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:03,781
I want to say I'm sorry.

416
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,912
-Wait.
-We're done.

417
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:11,706
-Make way.
-Anything else?

418
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,791
-What are your plans?
-How do you feel?

419
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,835
-That's enough.
-Anything else to say?

420
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:17,086
Did you expect this?

421
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,092
I heard what you did. Thanks.

422
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:29,932
You did well.

423
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,226
Good job.

424
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:35,563
Let's go.

425
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,356
Jeong-won, we're home.

426
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:23,611
Go and sleep more comfortably in your bed.

427
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:27,156
It's okay, Tae-heon.

428
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:49,929
I guess…

429
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:54,892
I don't stand a chance.

430
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,577
Before we get into Cha's case,

431
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,539
I'll ask you about Jin Myeong-suk's.

432
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:25,089
We found this diary at your place.

433
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:29,677
You wrote in it
throughout middle school and high school.

434
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:35,141
The entry for December 24, 2009
had something quite interesting.

435
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:38,686
"She told me so."

436
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:41,564
"If two people share a secret
no one else knows,

437
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:43,107
they become friends forever."

438
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,150
BONGTO CHEMICAL PLANT

439
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:46,694
"The riskier the secret,
the more exciting it is."

440
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:05,129
"If you want to feel on top of the world,
you can just stop someone's time."

441
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,298
"How did she think of that?"

442
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:34,617
BLOCK 4

443
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,536
BONGTO CHEMICAL PLANT

444
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:02,895
"The flames we created were,
just as she said, truly splendid."

445
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:07,149
"Thank you for creating a secret
we can keep forever."

446
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:12,488
This…

447
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,991
We tested it
and it was Jin Myeong-suk's blood.

448
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:18,994
You killed her

449
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,414
because of the diary, didn't you?

450
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:25,626
With this knife.

451
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,758
THE DAY OF JIN MYEONG-SUK'S MURDER

452
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:50,818
What brings you here

453
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:53,571
all of a sudden?

454
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:57,992
Ms. Jin,

455
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,538
why did you take my diary
without telling me?

456
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:09,086
You must know what happened
at the Bongto plant now.

457
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,089
Give it back.

458
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:18,387
Give it to me right now.

459
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:07,686
What's this money?

460
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:18,989
It's fine.

461
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,532
It'll be fine!

462
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:27,915
No.

463
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:29,833
It's not yours.

464
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:33,003
It's not for you.

465
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,897
WARNING

466
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:56,527
Does the knife remind you
of when you killed Jin?

467
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:01,407
Is it not her

468
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:05,411
you were thinking of
when you killed Cha Eun-sae?

469
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,915
THE DAY OF CHA EUN-SAE'S MURDER

470
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:28,183
Who are you?

471
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:50,289
We don't just have your diary.

472
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:52,791
Both Jin and Cha's blood
were found on the knife.

473
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,376
You can't worm your way out.

474
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:58,213
You killed Jin because she learned
about your arson.

475
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:00,924
Why did you kill Cha Eun-sae?

476
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,509
Did Yoo Yun-yeong tell you to?

477
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:06,180
Like when you set the fire together
to kill Lee Na-ri?

478
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:10,267
Detective, my client seems to be unwell.

479
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:11,560
Can we stop--

480
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:13,937
You killed them,

481
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:16,648
but wasn't it Yoo Yun-yeong
who put you up to it

482
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:19,109
and left all the signatures at the scenes?

483
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,361
Why did you do as she said?

484
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:25,115
What is your relationship with her
that you're covering for her?

485
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:28,994
Do you think she can get away with it
if you keep quiet?

486
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,373
Are you all right?

487
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:37,127
Are you okay?

488
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,430
CAPTAIN JUNG IN-GI

489
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:49,765
That's it for today.

490
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:11,995
You must be upset.

491
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:17,167
You must lie low because of Soo-rin
when the election's so close.

492
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,964
Having a lot to lose means you have a lot.

493
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:24,132
Part of me is jealous.

494
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:25,926
Who could dream

495
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,512
of becoming the President?

496
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:31,223
You're one of very few.

497
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:32,975
Just get to the point.

498
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,022
Fill this up for me.

499
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:42,651
But I won't leave the country.

500
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:46,029
I plan to take a break somewhere private.

501
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:53,287
You must think I'm a nuisance.

502
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:54,913
But what could I do?

503
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,708
It's just my luck
that your daughter loves me

504
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:00,002
and that you're an assemblyman.

505
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:01,128
All of this is

506
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:03,171
just my luck.

507
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:05,716
Don't worry.

508
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:08,635
I want you to become the President
more than anyone else.

509
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,514
Call me when it's all filled up.

510
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:15,392
Don't do a sloppy job like your daughter.

511
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,367
Gosh. This is driving me crazy.

512
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:34,786
There was no word about her accomplice,

513
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:38,415
and her lawyer keeps claiming insanity,
blaming it on drug side effects.

514
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,627
Have you located Yoo?

515
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,128
Is her phone still off?

516
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:46,465
Yes. She hasn't turned it on
since two nights ago.

517
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:48,508
She's determined to stay hidden.

518
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,136
Any attempts to leave the country?

519
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:52,346
Are you keeping track?

520
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:55,474
Yes. As Tae-heon said,
I put some men on stakeout duty.

521
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,851
But she's not showing up.

522
00:48:57,934 --> 00:49:00,354
It looks like she will keep quiet
and take the fall alone.

523
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:03,190
Should we request a warrant just for her?

524
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:05,275
No, we can't do that.

525
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:15,661
ASSEMBLYMAN MO HALTS CAMPAIGN

526
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:22,376
I think Mo Hyeong-taek
already knew about his daughter's crimes.

527
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:26,630
CHIEF KANG IN-HAN

528
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:31,468
Sir, I need to talk to you now.

529
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:35,597
I thought you'd be having a hard time.

530
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:38,767
What did you want to ask me about
other than your own situation?

531
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,936
When I told you I had a suspect in mind,

532
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:46,233
you were sure it was Mo Hyeong-taek
and said this, "I knew it."

533
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:47,776
"So what I heard was true."

534
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,278
What did you hear?

535
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:51,947
Something that can be used against him?

536
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,990
His daughter is about to get arrested.

537
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:56,993
Do you really have to find dirt on him?

538
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,705
I exposed a woman named Yoo
during my interview.

539
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:01,456
She's Mo Soo-rin's accomplice.

540
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:04,251
Mo Soo-rin just did
what Yoo told her to do.

541
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,211
I bet Mo Hyeong-taek knew about this.

542
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:10,173
He should defend his daughter
and deny she killed willingly

543
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:11,466
to save his career.

544
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,677
It's odd that he's staying quiet
about her accomplice.

545
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:14,845
Something is up.

546
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,681
So you're saying…

547
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:20,976
Her accomplice might have something
on Mo Hyeong-taek.

548
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:22,436
Something he wants to hide.

549
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,355
What is it that you know?

550
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:33,905
His wife is in the hospital
because she's in a vegetative state.

551
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:36,533
She rolled down the stairs
at home 13 years ago.

552
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:38,994
That was the conclusion
of the investigation.

553
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:42,164
Rumor has it that
it was actually Mo Hyeong-taek's order.

554
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:45,792
I know that you don't want me to do that.

555
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,588
I don't expect you to forgive me.

556
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:01,475
-He's coming out.
-Here he comes.

557
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:02,726
-He's out.
-Is he?

558
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:06,146
-Did you meet your arrested daughter?
-Give us a comment.

559
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,815
When did you become aware
of your daughter's crimes?

560
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:12,027
Your daughter was arrested
on suspicion of killing Jin and Cha.

561
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,445
How do you feel right now?

562
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:15,113
Ms. Seo…

563
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:18,283
what do you want to hear from me?

564
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:25,665
You knew that your daughter

565
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,084
didn't act alone in both cases,
didn't you?

566
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:30,629
You also know who her accomplice is.

567
00:51:31,087 --> 00:51:32,714
How come you're not speaking up?

568
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:35,008
I've been thinking about

569
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,385
what kind of decision

570
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:41,515
I should make to truly help my daughter.

571
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:51,233
Someone came into the house?

572
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:53,902
Did you see that person's face?

573
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:56,196
THE DAY AFTER JIN'S MURDER

574
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,405
It was a young man.

575
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,326
I only caught a glimpse of him
as he took the bag of money.

576
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:05,455
What if we end up in trouble
because of him?

577
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:06,915
He ran away with the money

578
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:09,251
even after seeing
Jin Myeong-suk wasn't dead.

579
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:13,004
He can't get out of this scot-free.
Don't worry.

580
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,423
I checked the crime scene thoroughly.

581
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:17,801
You were at the scene?

582
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:19,553
Yes.

583
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,639
I was the one who set the stage.

584
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:24,850
I ought to bring down the curtains myself.

585
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:27,269
Well done, Soo-rin.

586
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,533
Ms. Seo was right.

587
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:45,495
Yoo, the woman she exposed
during her interview on the news,

588
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:51,209
indeed instigated my daughter
to commit murder.

589
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:52,711
She instigated the murder?

590
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:53,837
What do you mean?

591
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,215
YOO INSTIGATED MY DAUGHTER
TO COMMIT MURDER

592
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:01,011
Have them ban her
from leaving the country.

593
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:02,971
We got a voice recording.
Let's put out an APB.

594
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:05,849
Yoo, who went to the same high school
as my daughter,

595
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:08,560
had dominated and manipulated her
for a long time.

596
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:11,855
I don't have evidence
that she instigated Cha's murder,

597
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:16,151
but she probably committed the murder
because Yoo told her to do so.

598
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:22,073
Earlier,

599
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:25,076
you said you had to think about
what kind of decision

600
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,411
would truly help your daughter.

601
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:29,122
If she committed the murders
for someone else's sake,

602
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:31,333
wouldn't it have been better
to say this sooner?

603
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:34,002
Why did you keep it a secret
all this time?

604
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,296
Because her accomplice

605
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:41,635
knew about our family's dark secret.

606
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:44,846
Thirteen years ago,

607
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:50,268
my wife tumbled down the stairs at home
and ended up in a vegetative state.

608
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:52,896
You're not normal.
I'm taking you to the hospital.

609
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:55,440
No! Who are you to tell me what to do?

610
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:56,816
If you don't go…

611
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,569
My wife and daughter
got into a small fight.

612
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:03,490
Then my daughter pushed her,
so she ended up in an accident.

613
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:05,408
And when it happened,

614
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:08,954
her friend was in my house.

615
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,748
So she witnessed the accident.

616
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:13,291
She saw the accident?

617
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:16,503
Her friend urged her
to kill Ms. Jin in the end.

618
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:18,630
Not only that,

619
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:21,758
she tried to kill me too.

620
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:30,183
-That's a huge scar.
-A scar!

621
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:32,519
-Really?
-Did you see that?

622
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:34,229
-He survived.
-What happened?

623
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,525
-What?
-What is that?

624
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:39,693
Is that a stab wound?

625
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:42,612
-Did she stab him?
-She stabbed her own father?

626
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:43,697
Darn it.

627
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:46,157
Now that my daughter is caught,

628
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,159
I'm disclosing everything…

629
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:49,244
ALMOST KILLED BY DAUGHTER

630
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:51,079
…as a means of repentance.

631
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:56,751
Please condemn me.

632
00:54:58,169 --> 00:54:59,254
And…

633
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:04,801
please catch the accomplice
who ruined my daughter's life

634
00:55:05,301 --> 00:55:06,386
and punish her.

635
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:10,223
I implore you desperately for your help.

636
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:32,537
What do you think you're doing?

637
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:36,207
You should've said the drug side effects
caused her hallucinations,

638
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:38,501
not made me look like a psychopath!

639
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:40,045
What are you trying to pull?

640
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:43,590
You made those scars, didn't you?

641
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:46,009
You were going to sacrifice her
in the worst-case scenario,

642
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:48,553
so you could get off alone
by turning yourself into a victim.

643
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:51,848
Am I wrong?
That's what you're doing! Darn it.

644
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:53,224
If I admit that,

645
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:55,894
will you admit it too?

646
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:58,188
That it's all over?

647
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:00,774
What?

648
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:09,676
TO YUN-YEONG
SEOL WOO-JAE

649
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:10,844
Here you go.

650
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:31,656
I have no idea where Yun-yeong could be

651
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:33,533
right now.

652
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:37,120
I have a few guys tracking her down
as per your order,

653
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:38,830
but we've found nothing yet.

654
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:03,062
Will they charge me with the murders?

655
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:11,112
Yoo, the woman she exposed
during her interview on the news,

656
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:15,158
indeed instigated my daughter
to commit murder.

657
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:17,619
Thirteen years ago,

658
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:23,666
my wife tumbled down the stairs at home
and ended up in a vegetative state.

659
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:27,378
My wife and my daughter
got into a small fight.

660
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:30,798
Then my daughter pushed her down,
so she ended up in an accident.

661
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:39,766
Is what your father said true?

662
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:41,100
Did you push your mother?

663
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:44,812
Also, is it true that you tried

664
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:47,273
to stab your father to kill him?

665
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:52,195
Mr. Mo showed us

666
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:56,032
the scar on his chest
and revealed everything.

667
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:02,747
No, I never did that.

668
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:06,084
It wasn't me. It wasn't Yun-yeong.

669
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:07,877
It wasn't her either.

670
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:15,134
Do you know how I found the knife

671
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:18,137
you had hidden in the memorial hall?

672
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,140
Yoo Yun-yeong told Seol Woo-jae

673
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:23,601
so we could arrest you.

674
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:28,147
You're lying.

675
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:30,608
You are lying.

676
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:34,279
That's a lie!

677
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:36,489
You're lying!

678
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,449
You're lying!

679
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:02,307
Are you home?

680
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:32,128
I'm here…

681
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:35,214
Jeong-won.

682
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:38,259
Join me.

683
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:17,423
Yoo's phone just turned on.

684
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:18,758
What? Where?

685
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:20,385
Jeong-won.

686
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:22,428
There's no way Yun-yeong betrayed me.

687
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:24,514
I trust Yun-yeong.

688
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:26,224
Don't do this.

689
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:27,225
Hey, Woo-jae.

690
01:01:27,308 --> 01:01:30,144
If you hurt Jeong-won,
I'll kill you and then kill myself too.

691
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:32,563
Why are you trying so hard
to make Woo-jae miserable?

692
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:34,190
There's only one thing I want now.

693
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:35,858
I don't want Woo-jae to forget me.

694
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:37,860
He pegged Park Jin-su as the arsonist,

695
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:40,029
knowing that I was the one
who started the fire.

696
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:42,365
Shouldn't my dad
take responsibility for that?

697
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:44,826
Now, there's a higher chance
that it's not Lee Na-ri.

698
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:47,120
If we find something,
I'll let you know right away.

699
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:48,454
I'm recharging.

700
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:52,083
There must be a reason
I didn't die and survived.

701
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:53,543
DIVORCE CONFIRMATION

702
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:54,877
Let's get a divorce.
