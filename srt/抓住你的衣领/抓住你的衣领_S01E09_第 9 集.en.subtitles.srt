00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:49,382
ALL LOCATIONS, PEOPLE, ORGANIZATIONS,
INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:05,356
When I saw them, I was so surprised too.

3
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,818
They're Cha Eun-sae and Jeong-won, right?

4
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:17,035
These pictures. Where did you get them?

5
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,080
I found this envelope
under my windshield wipers.

6
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,414
Where was your car?

7
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:24,334
I drank last night,
so I left it parked in an alley.

8
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:28,004
The thing is, it's a blind spot
with no cameras around.

9
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:32,091
Whoever did this must've known
Jeong-won was my patient.

10
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,760
I think this was planned.

11
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,595
-You must have a dashcam in--
-I'm sorry.

12
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,847
I don't have a dashcam in my car.

13
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,356
Anyway, I'll take these,

14
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,399
for a quick investigation.

15
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,569
Don't share these photos with the media.

16
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,696
Okay, I won't.

19
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,786
I was swamped with work yesterday,

20
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,413
so I couldn't come home.

21
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,956
I'm at the broadcasting station.

22
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,791
Let's talk. Now.

23
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:51,838
I found this picture
on a flash drive Yun-yeong had.

24
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:56,801
This necklace was in my old studio.
Yun-yeong took it.

25
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,094
Are you sure it's mine?

26
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:01,598
I checked the serial number.
It's the necklace I got you.

27
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:04,475
After all,

28
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,561
my instinct was right.

What's that picture?

32
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,220
It's not true, right?

33
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,058
Why can't you say it's not true?

34
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,770
Did you want to get back at me?

35
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,606
Is this what you wanted?

39
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,296
-Hey.
-Hey, did you read the article?

40
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,755
Did you find anything?

41
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,758
They already took all the hard drives,
but that's not important--

42
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:01,843
We might find something,

43
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:04,220
so comb through all the documents
you see there.

44
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,555
Don't leave anything out, okay?

45
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:06,889
Okay, I heard you.

46
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:10,101
But seriously, do not contact
or meet Reporter Seo for the time being.

47
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:11,185
You got that?

48
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,270
Seriously, no more.

49
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:15,982
-No more what?
-You know what I'm talking about.

50
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,483
She's married.

51
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,819

your life will be ruined.

52
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,530
"Ruined"? So be it, then.

53
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:23,614
Hey, Tae-heon!

55
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,086
Look at this now.

56
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:41,883
Hey, Seo Jeong-won.

57
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,887
Nice scoop, right? I bet you're jealous.

58
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,807
That article, it's not true.

59
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:53,227
It's not true?
Then how will you explain that photo?

60
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,647
The Human Resource Committee is
already discussing disciplinary measures.

61
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,483
Really?

62
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,861
So they'll cancel the plan
to resume Nothing Uncovered next week.

63
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:04,781
Then the show…

64
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,033
We should do it this week, then.

65
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:11,537
Hey, forget about the show.
You're on the chopping block right now.

66
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,206
I have a suspect.

67
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,249
Really?

68
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,503
I bet you're just saying that
to mislead me.

69
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,647
It's Mo Hyeong-taek, isn't it? I knew it.

70
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,857
So, what I heard was true.

71
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,442
What did you hear?

72
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,569
Forget it.

73
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,571
How did you dismantle his alibi?

74
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,658
It's not Mo Hyeong-taek.

75
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,284
It's not him?

76
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:51,786
Then who is it?

77
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,831
Hey, do you have any evidence?

78
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:59,794
I found out who took the necklace
from the scene of Cha's murder.

79
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:03,172
-I have a picture to back it up too.
-Okay, so who is it?

80
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,634
I will tell you everything,
so please get a slot for the show.

81
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,136
Hey, seriously.

82
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:11,347
You want to do the show
just because you feel it's unfair?

83
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,016
Yes, I have to do it
because I was falsely accused.

84
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,353
I didn't kill Cha Eun-sae,
but my necklace was found at the scene,

85
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,273
and the prime suspect is the person
who tried to ruin me.

86
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,192
And, yes, I want to broadcast it.

87
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,069
We must tell the truth,

88
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,864
including who the suspect is
and what I did wrong.

89
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:29,866
What you did wrong?

90
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,162
Please get a slot for the show.

91
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,331
I'm not even curious.

92
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,083
This is over. Get out.

93
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:54,640
Have you lost your mind?

94
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,143
I told you to cheat on him too,
thinking you'd never do it.

95
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:58,436
But you actually did it.

96
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,065
It's not true,

97
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:08,154
but I couldn't say that to my husband.

98
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,822
So you're not having an affair?

99
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,909
Then why can't you tell your husband that?

100
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,539
Because Detective Kim
has feelings for you?

101
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,584
And because you like him too?

102
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,465
Oh, dear.

103
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:31,219
I know you.
You must've tried to push him away.

104
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:39,060
Nothing drives you crazier
than not being able to follow your heart.

105
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,613
I have to pull myself together.

106
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:53,991
I will snap out of it.

107
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,329
About Ba-reun…

108
00:08:58,871 --> 00:08:59,997
he missed work, right?

109
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,165
Right.

110
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,918
Did you talk to him last night?

111
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,212
What were you going to say?

112
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:12,593
I had an informant
who got me information illegally.

113
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,180
It was Ba-reun.

114
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:17,765
What?

115
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,935
Wait, are you saying

116
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,188
Ba-reun approached you

117
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,983
and double-crossed you?

118
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,486
Oh, my gosh.

119
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,947
What on earth is happening?

120
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:37,577
Right.

121
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,955
The day you got kidnapped,

122
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,416
Ba-reun said

123
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,335
he cared about you

124
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,255
because he had suffered the same way.

125
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:50,965
The same way?

126
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,008
Yes.

127
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,639
Can you tell me
if they were Photoshopped or retouched?

128
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:02,685
It looks like
it was taken from inside the room.

129
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,895
They're either Photoshopped

130
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:07,773
or from a spy cam.

131
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,737
That's why I need them analyzed.

132
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,323
You said it's an unofficial request,

133
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:18,743
which means you didn't show these photos
to the police experts.

134
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,707
I read the article about you and Ms. Seo.

135
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,543
Are you all right?

136
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:33,424
-Professor…
-No one will know.

137
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,469
I've known you for too long.

138
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:38,846
Don't worry.

go after my wife?

142
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:04,830
Are you out of your mind?

143
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:08,209
Why must I explain myself
to a cheating husband?

144
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,131
That's enough.

145
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,510
What's enough, punk?

146
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,096
It's not enough.

I'd rather die than divorce her for you.

Jeong-won's my wife!

152
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:02,596
And you're nothing but a scumbag

How long do you think
your pathetic love will last?

Will it feel good forever?

155
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,901
Before you do,
Jeong-won will get tired and give up.

156
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,278
I know that.

157
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,487
Until then,

158
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:21,782
I'll just wait…

159
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,953
for her feelings for you to disappear,

160
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,374
for her to come back to me.

161
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,461
Why hurt her
if you're so desperate for her love?

162
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,339
Jeong-won did nothing wrong.

163
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,886
She asked me
not to have any feelings for her.

164
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,639
But I couldn't do that.

165
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:51,228
I clung to her and I kept hitting on her.

166
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,441
Have Jeong-won

167
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,236
get a restraining order against me.

168
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,698
That will clear her name.

00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:14,752
I should pay for it.

It's Seol Woo-jae.

175
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,988
I'd like to explain things

176
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,074
in an interview.

177
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:51,807
I couldn't keep Ji-ho under control
and the article got out.

178
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,601
It's my fault.

179
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,897

because I couldn't control myself.

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,524
It's my fault.

181
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,783
Did you come here to apologize?

182
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,248
My necklace was found
at Cha Eun-sae's scene.

183
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,710
I know who put it there.

184
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,004
Yoo Yun-yeong?

185
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:29,345
She left your necklace at the scene
but has a confirmed alibi. That means…

186
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,723
She either has an accomplice
or hired someone to kill her.

187
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:36,352
If you're right, it means a hitman
or someone close murdered her.

188
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,104
One person committed three murders.

189
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,356
If it was all Yoo,

190
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,025
hiring three hitmen
would've been way too risky.

191
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,488
Plus, she was just 19
at the time the factory burned down.

192
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:51,992
You're right.

193
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:56,288
My husband would be the person
closest to her.

194
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,624
He has an alibi.

195
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:02,294
Her clinic's registered
in someone else's name. Mo Soo-rin.

196
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,505
I looked her up.

197
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,674
She's Mo Hyeong-taek's daughter.

198
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,217
Could it be…

199
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:09,760
What is it?

200
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:12,888
Never mind.

201
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,349
I'll tell you when I'm sure.

202
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,115
-Jeong-won…
-Tae-heon…

203
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:36,954
There's something

204
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,001
I lied to you about.

205
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,297
I'll do whatever it takes

206
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,300
to expose Yoo Yun-yeong on air.

207
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,886
I'll explain everything myself.

208
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,265
Bear with me.

209
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,346
AE-NA

210
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,224
SEOL DENIES AND REQUESTS RESTRAINING ORDER

211
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,856
What is this about? Restraining order?

212
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:47,649
That's stupid.

213
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,861
It was my idea.

214
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,990
I'll handle them.

215
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,367
Just don't get hurt.

216
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,188
Let's stay like this

217
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,316
for just a minute.

218
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:33,779
Let me do this

219
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,031
for just one minute.

220
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,538
I was furious when I saw the article.

221
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,748
If I'd actually had an affair,

222
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,334
I wouldn't feel bad at least.

223
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,466
I hate that I can't control myself.

224
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,219
I hate that

225
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,764
this could hurt you.

226
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,736
I've been keeping my feelings inside
all this time.

227
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,323
I did everything I could

228
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,869
to push these feelings away.

229
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,338
Give me a minute too.

230
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,101
For taking my stuff without asking,

231
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,395
this is a small price to pay.

232
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,647
-Why did you do it?
-And why did you do it?

233
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,860
Why did you kill Cha Eun-sae?

234
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,823
Why did you do that? Why?

235
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,826
After killing Cha Eun-sae,

236
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,912
you framed Jeong-won as the culprit.

237
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,789
Is your goal to send her to prison?

238
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,124
My goal

239
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,584
is you.

240
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:38,964
Because you know you can't win my love,
are you trying to win my hatred?

241
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,967
Is that the kind of love you want?

242
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,182
This isn't love.

243
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:53,020
You just want to take me from her
because I was never yours.

244
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,355
Education, career, money, friends,

245
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,858
you've got everything you ever wanted
except me.

246
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,196
Despite that,
we've known each other for a long time.

247
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,616
You're a bit too much, but I never thought
you were evil by nature.

248
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,786
I had no idea how broken you were.

249
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:18,337
You killed someone
because you felt insecure after I left.

250
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,049
I didn't know you were such a monster.

251
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,096
You're calling me a monster?

252
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,476
Do you have the right to call me that?

253
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:36,897
Do you think I'm clueless?

254
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,732
I know everything.

255
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,942
I know what you've done.

256
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,153
What do you mean?

257
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,489
Don't talk in code.

258
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:46,948
I'm sure you understood me.

259
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,743
Must I really spell it out for you?

260
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:57,000
Don't worry.

261
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,670
I'm going to protect you.

262
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:38,250
I read your interview with Mr. Noh
in his article.

263
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,295
I didn't get much sleep last night.

264
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,548
Let's talk about this later.

265
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,174
Woo-jae…

266
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,101
I need to talk to you.

267
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,686
I know you didn't cheat on me.

268
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:59,896
Kim Tae-heon told me that.

269
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,065
You told him

270
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,025
not to have any feelings for you.

271
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:10,115
You were going to say that

272
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,659
you were tempted to, right?

273
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,120
So you pushed him away.

274
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,625
It's completely understandable.

275
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,839
You guys dated before we met,
and I ended up hurting you.

276
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,009
If he was determined to seduce you,

277
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,761
it's only natural you'd feel tempted.

278
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,853
I would've deserved that.

279
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:42,355
It's okay.

280
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:45,609
No…

281
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:50,238
To be honest, it's not okay.

282
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:53,950
But I'll accept it.

283
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,120
It's all my fault.

284
00:24:58,872 --> 00:24:59,873
And

285
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,334
thank you

286
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,045
for not caving.

287
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,548
That's not true.

288
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:14,596
I tried not to cave,

289
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,140
but I couldn't.

290
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,101
I…

291
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:29,486
Don't say it.

292
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:34,741
Don't say anything. Not a word.

293
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,166
Don't cry.

294
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:48,296
You're not sad because of me.
You're sad because of that jerk!

295
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,841
I have

296
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,803
feelings for him.

297
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,315
You are

298
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:10,860
so cruel.

299
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,282
When I found out about
your affair with Cha Eun-sae,

300
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,618
if you hadn't lied to me,

301
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:21,121
it would've hurt me less.

302
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:23,832
So

303
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,418
I'm telling you the truth.

304
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:27,502
No.

305
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,881
I want you to lie to me.
I don't need your honesty.

306
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:40,348
Please, Jeong-won,

307
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,226
tell me it's not true.

308
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,104
I'm begging you.

309
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:48,565
Please?

310
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:52,694
I expressed

311
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:55,864
my feelings to him.

312
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:58,950
There's no going back now.

313
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:02,620
I'm sorry.

314
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:46,623
CHAIRMAN SEOL WOO-JAE

315
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:47,832
Sir.

316
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,210
MUJIN WELFARE FOUNDATION

317
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:04,516
How dare you show up here?

318
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,935
Get lost before I kill you.

319
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:12,440
Yoo Yun-yeong gave me
some photos yesterday.

320
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,944
The photos of Jeong-won
next to Cha's dead body

321
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:19,030
in Unit 1401 of Leaders Palace.

322
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,077
That means…

323
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,870
Jeong-won was at the scene.

324
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,791
There's no way Jeong-won killed her.

325
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,920
She probably saw the body and ran out.

326
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:35,964
Those photos actually confirm

327
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:39,092
that spy cameras were set up in advance

328
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,885
and that Jeong-won was lured to the scene

329
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,263
by a text message with the wrong address.

330
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:45,557
Then Jeong-won's necklace
was left in Cha's hand.

331
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,100
It was a premeditated murder.

332
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:54,983
That said,

333
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:59,070
you're the only one
I can turn to right now.

334
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,574
So help me.

335
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,047
If Yoo Yun-yeong planned everything,

336
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:21,009
and if someone close to her
committed the murder…

337
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,846
What if it was Mo Soo-rin?

338
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,235
I heard that this coffee
was why Ms. Yoo Yun-yeong

339
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,654
decided to move into my husband's
old studio space.

340
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:46,743
Your employee told me
that you two were very close.

341
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,873
Jeong-in, you can take a break
and grab a bite to eat.

342
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:53,750
Sure.

343
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,132
I also know

344
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:05,178
that Ms. Yoo's clinic is in your name,

345
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:08,723
and that you two were classmates
in your senior year of high school.

346
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,016
My husband too.

347
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,728
You look like you know everything too,

348
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,481
including why I'm suddenly saying this.

349
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:24,155
You know Ms. Yoo Yun-yeong well, right?

350
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:28,827
My necklace was found
at the scene of Cha Eun-sae's murder,

351
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:32,747
but Ms. Yoo had that same necklace.
Did you know that?

352
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:38,044
You must also know
that she was at the scene too.

353
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,212
You know everything,

354
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:40,964
don't you?

355
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:43,466
But Yun-yeong has an alibi.

356
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,010
An alibi?
You mean, the video of the waiting room?

357
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,763
They've concluded that it was manipulated.

358
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,849
What? That can't be.

359
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:54,853
Also, her fingerprints
were found in the AC plant room

360
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,856
in Unit 1401 of Leaders Palace.

361
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:04,028
It means she was hiding at the scene
the day Cha Eun-sae was killed.

362
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,657
That room is too small to hide in.

363
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,200
And how do you know that?

364
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:14,873
Tell me.

365
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:19,210
How do you know
the layout of Unit 1401 so well?

366
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,590
I have nothing more to tell you.

367
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,383
Please leave.

368
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,802
-Ms. Mo--
-I asked you to leave.

369
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,698
CHA EUN-SAE
3 MONTHS PREGNANT

370
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,255
Hey.

371
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:07,258
The person who did the job,
I think it was Mo Soo-rin.

372
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,803
Mo Soo-rin?
You mean, Mo Hyeong-taek's daughter?

373
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:13,514
Yes, I met her earlier in the day.

374
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,684
She knows the layout of Unit 1401
like the back of her hand.

375
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:20,146
I'll send you what I jotted down
on her relationship with Yun-yeong

376
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:23,608
and the video of Yun-yeong's
last session with Cha. Go through them.

377
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:24,651
All right.

378
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:30,448
YOO YUN-YEONG, SEOL WOO-JAE, MO SOO-RIN
WENT TO MUEON HIGH TOGETHER

379
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:35,536
Yoo and Mo were classmates
in their senior year of high school?

380
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,706
The fire at the plant
broke out in the same year.

381
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,547
Hello, Detective Bong, it's me.

382
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,758
Who was in charge
of the crime scene investigation

383
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,593
of the Bongto Plant fire case?

384
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,307
Detective Bong briefly told me about it.

385
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:59,018
That old case
is suddenly getting all this attention.

386
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,645
This feels weird.

387
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:02,689
I went through all the case reports.

388
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:05,650
Were any of the details
from the ignition analysis omitted

389
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:07,694
or simply not reflected in the reports?

390
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,904
We were sure of one ignition location
at the scene.

391
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,073
We analyzed another location suggested,

392
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,450
and the probability was about 60%.

393
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:18,121
But at the time, Prosecutor Mo said
it was irrelevant and covered it up,

394
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,539
so we had to leave it out.

395
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,083
So Mo Hyeong-taek made you leave it out.

396
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:26,713
It's odd.

397
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,927
Politicians who took bribes in the past
have no problem making a comeback,

398
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,430
but it's nearly impossible for reporters.

399
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:39,142
I guess that could be why

400
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:43,813
you're still bending over backwards
for me to this day.

401
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:53,781
I hear she still doesn't know her place
and insists on doing the show.

402
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,283
We'll have no problems, right?

403
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,702
Next week's show has been canceled.

404
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,412
She can't do it.

405
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,376
Good work.

406
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:26,606
Should I just give up
since it won't happen?

407
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,362
ZEUS

408
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:51,547
They're photos from Mo Soo-rin's phone.

409
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:06,062
These photos are from
Mo Hyeong-taek's daughter's phone?

410
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,275
The show got canceled altogether
because you keep digging like this.

411
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:14,779
Are you saying
Mo Hyeong-taek pulled some strings?

412
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,199
Will you keep letting the higher-ups
dictate your actions?

413
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,992
You're the head of the department.

414
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,621
When you were at Mueon KBM,
you took bribes from Prosecutor Mo

415
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,040
and worked for him, didn't you?

416
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,837
That's right. I did.

417
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:35,967
But I got chewed out by a senior
who was just like you and backed out.

418
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:39,762
That's right.
It was your dad, Reporter Seo Sang-gyeon.

419
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:42,348
You're so persistent, just like him.

420
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:48,062
If people find out about it,
my career is over.

421
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,195
I get what you're saying.

422
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:04,328
Swapping out one of the interviews
on News Nine is the only way.

423
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,247
You'll have three minutes.

424
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,946
I got an interview on News Nine.

425
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,825
I'll expose the suspect
and the possibility of an accomplice.

426
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:44,785
Once the interview airs,

427
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,288
you'll have to question
Yoo Yun-yeong right away.

428
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:49,123
Can you do it?

429
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,875
Don't worry about that.

430
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:54,795
But do you have evidence to back up
that there might be an accomplice?

431
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,589
Ba-reun sent me some evidence.

432
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:59,634
You should comb through everything
in that house too.

433
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:02,595
Ba-reun was investigating
Mo Hyeong-taek and his family,

434
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:04,222
so you might find something important.

435
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:06,057
I'm combing through everything now.

436
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,103
Good luck with the interview.

437
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,024
Thanks.

438
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:26,494
I would like to take this opportunity
to tell the viewers something.

439
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:28,913
I am here

440
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:31,666
to expose myself

441
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,794
for one last time.

442
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:40,258
I told you not to even call Reporter Seo
for the time being.

443
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,261
You never listen to me.

444
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,637
Shut it.

445
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,430
Don't be distracted.

446
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:50,268
See if you can find anything
on Mo Soo-rin or the fire case.

447
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,193
BONGTO PLANT CASE REPORT
NOT ACCEPTED

448
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:03,239
ARSON CASE
SUSPECT: PARK JIN-SU

449
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:04,740
CHANCE OF AIDING AND ABETTING

450
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:07,243
CURRENT STANCE

451
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:10,037
CONSIDERING THE POSSIBILITY
OF AN ACCOMPLICE

452
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:14,250
-I can use this to put pressure.
-On whom?

453
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:37,815
You're interviewing someone else.
Seo Jeong-won will come on.

454
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:38,899
What?

455
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,655
KBM NEWS NINE

456
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:55,666
On today's Focus Interview,
I'll speak with Reporter Seo Jeong-won.

457
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,710
-Hello.
-Hello.

458
00:38:57,793 --> 00:39:02,965
A month ago, you publicly announced
you'd reveal who killed Cha Eun-sae.

459
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:06,886
Yes, and I'm here today
to keep that promise.

460
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,305
Necklace photo, on screen now.

461
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:13,017
This is a photo from the scene
of Cha Eun-sae's murder.

462
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,228
The serial number showed
the necklace was mine,

463
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:18,689
and that's why
I was questioned by the police.

464
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:26,530
I recently found out that
I left the necklace at a studio

465
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:30,034
belonging to my husband Seol Woo-jae,
and that someone had taken it.

466
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:33,788
Cha Eun-sae and I
weren't my husband's only visitors.

467
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,123
His high-school friend,
whom I'll call A for now,

468
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,708
had also been there.

469
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,168
Photo, on screen now.

470
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:42,254
This is a photo of my necklace
that was in A's possession.

471
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:45,674
The serial number confirms
it's a photo of my necklace.

472
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:49,428
Why did she have my necklace?

473
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:53,808
And why did that necklace
go from being in her possession

474
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,852
to being found in the hand
of the dead Cha Eun-sae?

475
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:58,521
And one more thing.

476
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:02,316
A has an alibi
for the time of Cha's murder,

477
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,610
so she wasn't named a prime suspect.

478
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:08,489
Now we must turn our attention
to someone else.

479
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:11,992
It's B, someone very close to A.

480
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,661
On B's phone,

481
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:17,081
there were photos of Cha's office
like these,

482
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:20,000
which was also the murder scene.

483
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:24,463
Why on earth did B
take photos of the scene?

484
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:27,258
If B doesn't have an alibi,

485
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:31,178
can't we suppose
they could be an accomplice?

486
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,563
The two of you,
who might be watching right now,

487
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:44,150
must know the answer
to all these questions.

488
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,778
-Please cooperate with the police.
-Okay.

489
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,656
-And tell them the truth.
-I'll do that now.

490
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,701
What are you doing? Cut the transmission.

491
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,619
-What?
-Take them off the air.

492
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:58,289
Finally, to the viewers, I'd like to say--

493
00:40:58,372 --> 00:40:59,999
Ms. Seo, thank you.

494
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,001
Here's the next report.

495
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:06,422
It's a summary
of cultural events happening nationwide.

496
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:08,382
-Please watch.
-She was still talking.

497
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:30,738
You're going to arrest me
for the murder of Cha Eun-sae?

498
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:33,741
Because of a photo of a necklace?

499
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,076
You made illegal prescriptions
for propofol.

500
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:40,456
You're under arrest
for breaking the Narcotics Control Act.

501
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:44,460
You can keep quiet,

502
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:48,672
and what you say
can be used in court against you.

503
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,090
You can hire a lawyer too.

504
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:54,011
SEARCH AND SEIZURE WARRANT

505
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:57,139
We'll search your office and home
and take everything that's relevant.

506
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,900
INTERVIEW WITH REPORTER SEO JEONG-WON

507
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:20,996
Assemblyman Mo

508
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,666
instructed me to buy you
a plane ticket to New York.

509
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,502
Would 2:00 p.m. suit you?

510
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:50,693
You'll also pay the price for taking
illegally prescribed medication.

511
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:54,363
I'm not stupid enough not to know that.

512
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:22,891
This photo was on a flash drive
that was in your possession.

513
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:24,768
You took it, didn't you?

514
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:28,731
I thought I was here
for writing illegal prescriptions.

515
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:31,358
I care more about this case than that one.

516
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:36,739
The day Cha Eun-sae was killed,
did you go to Leaders Palace Unit 1401?

517
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:39,742
-Yes.
-At what time?

518
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,078
Was it around 4:00 p.m.?

519
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:44,913
Seol Woo-jae was there too,

520
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,249
so I didn't stay long.

521
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,840
Congratulations on becoming a dad.

522
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,509
I'll retire and move abroad.

523
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:58,886
DAY OF CHA EUN-SAE'S MURDER

524
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,679
I'll wait until you get a divorce.

525
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:08,479
Eun-sae,

526
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:12,858
did you think I wouldn't know

527
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:15,319
you're seeing other guys too?

528
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,112
What do you mean?

529
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:29,291
Sorry.

530
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,211
I was hoping to have a coffee with you.

531
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:37,966
You two are talking,
so I'll come by another time.

532
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:41,011
-See you later.
-Okay.

533
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,932
GOOD LUCK, EUN-SAE
WISH YOU THE BEST

534
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:58,153
No, Woo-jae.
The baby is yours. It really is.

535
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,446
It's yours.

536
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,531
Is it?

537
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:04,368
Insist all you want,
but we ended things a long time ago.

538
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,170
I was with Cha Eun-sae that day,

539
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:17,589
and Yoo Yun-yeong did drop by.

540
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:22,136
Then, after 4:00 p.m.,
did you visit Unit 1401 again?

541
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,387
No.

542
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:26,432
Then how did Seo Jeong-won's necklace,
that you had,

543
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:28,267
end up in Cha Eun-sae's dead hand?

544
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:31,854
According to Seol Woo-jae,

545
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:34,940
you took the necklace
that had been in his studio.

546
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:38,026
I didn't take it. Woo-jae gave it to me,

547
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:42,739
in return for not telling anyone
about his affair with Cha Eun-sae.

548
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,201
That's a lie.

549
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:50,539
She did know about our affair,
but she stole the necklace.

550
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:53,542
When and how did you find out
about Seol Woo-jae's affair?

551
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,129
Early August, was it?

552
00:45:58,755 --> 00:46:00,799
Eun-sae told me during a session.

553
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:04,928
After hearing about the affair,
did you blackmail Seol Woo-jae?

554
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:07,764
No.

555
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:10,184
Why would I blackmail him?

556
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:13,937
Hearing my wife couldn't sleep
after finding Jin Myeong-suk's body,

557
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:16,356
she pressured me
to bring Jeong-won to see her.

558
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,485
She said she'd go public
about the affair if I didn't.

559
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:21,820
I bet that's when

560
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:24,823
she started to form a plan
to trap my wife.

561
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:27,576
I just started questioning you,

562
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:29,953
and you've lied twice already.

563
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,383
Yes.

564
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,927
Just as you thought,

565
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:48,263
Seol Woo-jae's watching
from the next room.

566
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:51,600
Since there's no point in lying now,

567
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:54,061
can I ask point-blank?

568
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:57,481
Why did you lie?
What are you trying to hide?

569
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:00,484
Perhaps your feelings toward Mr. Seol?

570
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:07,658
How did you feel after finding out
about his affair with Cha?

571
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:11,245
The man you had a crush on for a long time
was involved with two women.

572
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,749
"How come he liked Seo Jeong-won
and Cha Eun-sae, but not me?"

573
00:47:15,832 --> 00:47:17,251
Did this cross your mind?

574
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:21,922
You told him how you felt 14 years ago,
and he rejected you.

575
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:24,049
Back then, he was dating

576
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:28,053
a girl named Lee Na-ri, not you.

577
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:39,648
14 YEARS AGO

578
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,692
You know what's interesting?

579
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:27,904
The same culprit's signature was found
at both Lee's and Cha's murder scenes.

580
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:30,115
And it was also found at the murder scene

581
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:32,618
of Jin Myeong-suk,
Mo Hyeong-taek's housekeeper.

582
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:37,539
Aren't you curious about the signature
that was found at all three crime scenes?

583
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:38,874
Are you going to tell me?

584
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,502
Detective Kim, I have an alibi.

585
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:43,712
Yes, you do.

586
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:46,548
What if you were the mastermind,

587
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:49,843
and B, the individual Ms. Seo exposed,
executed the deeds?

588
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:51,928
What if Mo Soo-rin committed the murders?

589
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:55,349
Like was mentioned on the news,

590
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:59,561
did you know Mo Soo-rin had photos
of Unit 1401, the murder scene?

591
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:02,272
Even if those photos

592
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:05,150
were indeed from her phone,

593
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:08,028
she was just one of my many patients.

594
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:10,864
Her photos are irrelevant to me.

595
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:12,324
She's more than just a patient.

596
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:16,244
You've been close friends
since your senior year in high school.

597
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:19,998
Jin's murder, Cha's murder
and the fire at the plant,

598
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,875
you two conspired to commit them.

599
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:26,546
Just because we graduated
from the same school?

600
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:29,508
Do you even hear yourself?

601
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:33,261
The leader of the forensic team
in charge of the Bongto Plant case said

602
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:36,765
he had mentioned the possibility
of an accomplice in his report,

603
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:38,600
but Prosecutor Mo Hyeong-taek
covered it up.

604
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:41,812
Connecting the dots,

605
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:45,857
this means both you and Ms. Mo Soo-rin
are linked to all three cases.

606
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:47,651
Do you think this makes any sense?

607
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,950
You put Seo's necklace in Cha's hand
after she had been killed.

608
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:57,285
Didn't you?

609
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:34,656
Did she smile just now?

610
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,291
-What?
-Found anything?

611
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:46,626
We're searching everything here.

612
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:49,963
Yoo Yun-yeong isn't even scared.
She's completely unfazed.

613
00:50:50,046 --> 00:50:51,882
Bring me proof
that she instigated the murder.

614
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:54,176
-We can't arrest her without that.
-Got it.

615
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,889
We must find evidence from the raid.

616
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:06,730
Detective Kim,

617
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:10,859
what happened to the photos I gave to you?

618
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:14,863
Photos of Ms. Seo,
taken at the crime scene,

619
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:16,907
next to the dead body of Cha Eun-sae.

620
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:21,411
What photos? What's she talking about?

621
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:26,208
They're undergoing thorough analysis.

622
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:30,462
In case they're manipulated
or Photoshopped?

623
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:33,548
This is good to know.

624
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:37,135
I read in the news
about your affair with Ms. Seo.

625
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:39,763
I was concerned
that you might bury the evidence.

626
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:46,228
You know, I've been thinking
about those photos.

627
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:50,816
Assuming those are original copies,
the camera angle suggests that

628
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:53,151
the photos were taken from inside.

629
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:55,737
If there wasn't a third person
at the scene,

630
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:58,615
a spy cam must have filmed that.

631
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,909
That's what you think too, right?

632
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:05,413
Right.

633
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:09,000
I kept a folder
of Ms. Seo's therapy session videos

634
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:10,252
on my office computer.

635
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:13,755
You should watch the one
from the day of Cha's murder.

636
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:16,842
There's blood on Ms. Seo's sleeve.

637
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:21,763
In my opinion,
that blood belonged to Cha Eun-sae.

638
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:29,938
So when I asked Ms. Seo
if she still had the shirt at home,

639
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:32,315
Woo-jae stepped in
and said he threw it out.

640
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:37,779
It means that even her husband

641
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:40,407
thought she might be the murderer.

642
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:43,952
You should ask Woo-jae

643
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:48,999
if he actually threw it out.

644
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:07,183
If you're done questioning me,
please release me now.

645
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:09,895
You wanted to question me
on suspicion of murder,

646
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:12,981
but you arrested me
for writing illegal prescriptions,

647
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:14,399
meaning there's no smoking gun.

648
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:16,318
I will find that smoking gun soon.

649
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:20,280
What is evident is
that you issued illegal prescriptions,

650
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:22,574
so you aren't getting released.

651
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:25,911
You know what?

652
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:29,706
Woo-jae's accusation is false
and one-sided.

653
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:31,958
I expected this. You know?

654
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,711
I knew Woo-jae
would report my illegal prescriptions

655
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:38,798
and you would frame me as the accomplice
with Ms. Seo's necklace.

656
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:47,182
You can raid my place all you want,

657
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,851
but you won't find anything.

658
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:11,456
What do we do?

659
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:13,208
You didn't get anything at all?

660
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:15,543
There's no proof
she issued illegal prescriptions,

661
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:17,963
let alone that she planned the murder
or had an accomplice.

662
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:19,214
It was squeaky clean.

663
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:21,883
No spy cams either?

664
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:23,093
No.

665
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:27,389
I thought we'd find something
from the raid.

666
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:28,556
This is bad.

667
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:33,186
By the way, I heard from Captain Jung.

668
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:35,605
What are these photos
Yoo Yun-yeong gave you?

669
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:37,941
Let's talk about that tomorrow.

670
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:47,325
Father, please forgive our sins.

671
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,786
Please save us from the fiery pit of fire.

672
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:53,456
Please watch over the souls in purgatory.

673
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:58,628
Watch over the soul
burdened with the most tragic abandonment.

674
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:07,929
THE DAY OF CHA EUN-SAE'S MURDER

675
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:19,607
Cha Eun-sae

676
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:24,946
suspects you and the assemblyman
as the culprits.

677
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:36,833
She said she had to do something about it
and would tell the police everything.

678
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:43,214
Once she exposes everything,
it will be over.

679
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,384
The truth about Myeong-suk's murder

680
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:49,012
and the fire will come out.

681
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:55,643
What do I do?

682
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:59,147
Oh, no. It's all because of my diary.

683
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:03,902
Don't cry.

684
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:07,864
It's a blessing
that we found out beforehand.

685
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,659
We can fix it now.

686
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:15,914
This will be it.

687
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:17,916
This

688
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:20,502
will end it

689
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:22,337
for good.

690
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:27,175
They will start installing
security cameras

691
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:28,843
all over the building tomorrow.

692
00:56:33,389 --> 00:56:34,933
We only have today to do it.

693
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:01,042
FATHER

694
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,715
-Yes.
-I know the police let you go.

695
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:08,883
Come home now.

696
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:24,315
I hear that woman, Yoo Yun-yeong,
is connected

697
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:27,402
to the Bongto Plant fire case,
the Jin Myeong-suk case

698
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:30,155
and the Cha Eun-sae case too.

699
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:32,031
That's right.

700
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:35,368
She's helping us.

701
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:42,750
It means the Lord
has already forgiven you for your sins.

702
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:46,087
The Lord will take good care of you
from now on.

703
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:53,428
As soon as the case is closed,

704
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:56,598
join the team
in charge of the second Mujin resort.

705
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:58,892
It'll take a while
for the case to be closed.

706
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:00,518
Yun-yeong

707
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:03,021
has an alibi.

708
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:07,901
They arrested her
without checking her alibi?

709
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:10,904
Yun-yeong planned everything,
but someone else executed it.

710
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:15,200
She set up spy cams at the scene
in advance, ordered the murder

711
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:16,951
and lured Jeong-won to the scene,

712
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:20,622
but without hard evidence,
we can't proceed.

713
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:22,749
There were spy cams?

714
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:27,754
I suspect Yun-yeong had an accomplice,

715
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:31,049
and it's someone you know.

716
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:34,177
If this person really was her accomplice,

717
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:37,722
then our plan to build
the second Mujin resort will be affected.

718
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:42,810
What should we do?

719
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:48,983
Seeing how the Lord keeps testing you

720
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:50,860
tells me

721
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:55,031
that I will never be forgiven for my sins,

722
00:58:58,117 --> 00:58:59,285
Father.

723
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:18,096
Hey, what's up?
You want to go to work with me?

724
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:21,140
I booked a small banquet room at a hotel.

725
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,267
My goodness.

726
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:24,602
For a party to celebrate?

727
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:27,689
I must say,
your interview was pretty cool.

728
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:29,023
I read some comments,

729
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:32,610
and it looks like, if the show
resumes next week, ratings will soar.

730
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:35,488
Hey, can you tell Chief Kang
and Reporter Joo

731
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:38,032
that I'll hold a press conference
at 2:00 p.m. today?

732
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:39,492
A press conference? Why?

733
00:59:40,868 --> 00:59:43,788
Did you forgot to say something
at the interview yesterday?

734
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:47,125
There's one last thing

735
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:49,210
I must expose.

736
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:01,389
After my press conference at 2:00 p.m.,
I'll come in for a police interview.

737
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:03,266
I want you to interview me.

738
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:07,395
-Tae-heon.
-Yes.

739
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:10,148
The analysis team said
they didn't have those photos.

740
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:11,608
What is going on?

741
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:15,612
Hey, Kim Tae-heon!

742
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:19,657
Have you lost your mind?

743
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,704
I lost the photos Yoo Yun-yeong gave me.

744
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:26,664
-Please wait until I find--
-You punk.

745
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:28,541
You didn't lost them. You hid them!

746
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,336
Look at this.

747
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:46,643
You're turning in your badge today.

748
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:48,728
So hand over the cuffs and your ID. Now!

749
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:20,093
What's going on?

750
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:25,890
The police suddenly barged in.

751
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:32,689
What's going on?

752
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:35,400
We're on duty.
Please give us a few minutes.

753
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:37,568
Sir!

754
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:39,862
Did you find something?

755
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:47,912
We found blood on the sole of these shoes.

756
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:57,171
Ms. Seo,

757
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:59,757
you're under arrest
for the murder of Cha Eun-sae.

758
01:02:52,977 --> 01:02:56,022
How much do you love her
to have gone that far?

759
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:57,440
I trusted her.

760
01:02:57,523 --> 01:03:00,985
It sounds like you feel betrayed now
because you trusted her.

761
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:02,779
I'll take a hit too.

762
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,530
We must catch the real culprit.

763
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:07,658
Please get Jeong-won released.
I'll do anything.

764
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:10,787
Soo-rin, I need you to do something
before you leave.

765
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:13,498
They found blood
on Reporter Seo's shoes, but…

766
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:15,082
Cha Eun-sae's blood?

767
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:17,835
Will you divorce her and marry me?

768
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:20,213
Have they issued an arrest warrant for me?

769
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:24,050
Do you know what you can do
when you're at the end of your rope?
