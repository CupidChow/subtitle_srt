00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:56,556
KWON MAN-SU'S ELECTION CAMPAIGN

2
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,227
Listen up, residents of Seongjin City!

3
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,814
Don't vote for candidate number one,
Kwon Man-su!

4
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,776
He's a complete hypocrite,
and he discriminates people!

5
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,321
Watch out for the bang!

6
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:17,619
Look at me, look at me

7
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:21,039
Look at me

8
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,471
He's having so much fun.

9
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,057
Don't you agree?

10
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,018
Should I just

11
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,396
have fun with you?

12
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:51,778
Should I do that?

13
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:03,081
A man in his 20s suddenly showed up naked
in front of Seongjin City Hall

14
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,668
where an election campaign was being held
and caused a big commotion.

15
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,379
But this young man turned out to be

16
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:12,715
Assemblyman Kwon Man-su's second son.

17
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,384
Thus, the incident will most likely
inflict a heavy blow

18
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,386
on the general election
which is a week away.

19
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,720
MR. KWON
SON OF ASSEMBLYMAN KWON

20
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,389
He locked me up for causing trouble.

21
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,684
He committed child abuse
and violated his human rights!

22
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,477
Kwon Man-su should resign his candidacy!

23
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,647
-Resign! Resign!
-After the recent incident,

24
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,733
many people including a few civic groups
have been requesting him

25
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:34,195
- to resign his candidacy.
-That man will have to resign.

26
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:37,240
- The integrity of the home is essential...
-What are you going to do about Ms. Ko?

27
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,367
- How can a cruel father like him
-She caused this to happen.

28
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,453
- take care of other people's families
-I don't know. What should we do?

29
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:43,913
and work for the country?

30
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,958
He should resign his candidacy.

31
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:57,677
CHAPTER 4 ZOMBIE KID

32
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:01,139
Look at me

33
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:04,142
-Someone take the microphone away!
- Candidate number one

34
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,643
3 HOURS AGO

35
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,147
-Hurry!
-My goodness.

36
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,773
-Look at him.
-My gosh.

37
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,191
What should we do?

38
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,821
Where are you going?
You said you wanted to have fun.

39
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:17,822
When did I say that?

40
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,199
Are you a mythomaniac?

41
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,411
What I said earlier...

42
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,205
I was just talking to myself.

43
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,167
Compliment me for doing the right thing.

44
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,877
-And what exactly is that?
-Kidnapping him.

45
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,922
You didn't stop him earlier.
You just let him be.

46
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,465
That's because I did the right thing.

47
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:37,592
Am I wrong?

48
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,385
Then why didn't you stop him?

49
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,807
How could I stop him
from dancing and singing

50
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,434
when he's so good at it?

51
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,315
Hey!

52
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,737
Who are you people?
Are you from the hospital?

53
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,531
No, I'm a writer. And he's my safety pin.

54
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:05,787
If anything happens to Assemblyman Kwon
because of what happened today...

55
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,829
Yes?

56
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,041
You'd better brace yourselves.

57
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,086
My goodness, really? You're so scary.

58
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,463
-I'm so frightened. What am I going to do?
-You little...

59
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,550
Watch yourself.

60
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:25,139
Both of you just crossed the line.

61
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:26,599
Brace yourselves.

62
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:32,188
Why does that idiot keep telling us
to brace ourselves?

63
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:42,407
Gang-tae, Gi-do wishes to talk to you.

64
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,161
I see you're working very hard.

65
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,959
Wait here. Don't go anywhere.

66
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,090
Let's go.

67
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:02,176
Anyway, thank you for helping us
despite your busy schedule.

68
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,182
Gang-tae.

69
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,603
All my wishes came true today.

70
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,483
Today was the best day of my life.

71
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:21,863
So don't get angry at her
for driving me here.

72
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:25,491
Okay?

73
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,833
-Mom, he'll be fine.
-Good gracious.

74
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,293
-Mom.
-He'll be okay.

75
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,797
I'm sorry, but we need a family member
to come with us to the hospital.

76
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,257
Are you crazy?

77
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,634
Why would we go to a psychiatric hospital?

78
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:48,347
Go ahead with your father.
I'll catch up with you later.

79
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:49,932
Mom.

80
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,643
Mom!

81
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,105
Gi-do.

82
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,318
Mom, I feel a lot better...

83
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:05,865
Are you happy now that you've humiliated
our entire family?

84
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:10,244
Are you satisfied
now that you've disgraced your father

85
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,955
who you have hated for all those years?

86
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,625
Mom, I just--

87
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,628
Why did you have to be born so dumb

88
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:23,132
and get treated that way?

89
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,843
Why do you always act out

90
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,221
only to make my heart ache so much?

91
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,598
Why couldn't you just stay quiet?

92
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,767
Why did you have to cross the line

93
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:36,938
and cause such a big a fuss, you fool?

94
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,315
Why?

95
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,511
My mom knows how to slap really hard.

96
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,183
She never cared about me

97
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,602
because she was always busy
taking care of my other siblings.

98
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,526
But I just realized something
after I got slapped by her.

99
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:25,653
Gang-tae.

100
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,365
My mom doesn't hate me.

101
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,617
She loves me like crazy.

102
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:35,872
How do you know?

103
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,875
You can tell
when you're the one getting hit.

104
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:43,421
For some reason, when someone
hits you with affection it strangely...

105
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,632
doesn't make you feel upset.

106
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,555
Gang-tae!

107
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:57,143
Why did you do that?
Why did you send your brother home first?

108
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,562
You should've stayed with him all day!

109
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,523
What were you doing
when he was getting beaten up?

110
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,485
I let you learn martial arts
so you could protect your brother.

111
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,487
How could you let him come home
looking like that?

112
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:10,531
Are you serious?

113
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,534
My gosh, it's pouring.

114
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,456
You'll catch a cold. Are you okay?

115
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,304
You see, honey,

116
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,516
I won't die early like you did.

117
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,520
I'm going to live a long life.

118
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:45,691
I'm going to watch Sang-tae
grow old and die.

119
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:50,029
And then, I'll die the next day.

120
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:01,916
Mom?

121
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:08,589
My goodness, did you wake up?

122
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,639
-Gang-tae.
-Yes?

123
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,892
You need to stay by your brother's side
until the day you die.

124
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,439
I'll raise him.

125
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:29,694
Your job is to look after your brother
and keep him safe.

126
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:31,404
Okay?

127
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,453
That's why

128
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,165
I gave birth to you.

129
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:01,851
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

130
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,274
We should go, too.

131
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,278
Ju-ri.

132
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,536
-We should also get going.
-Are we going to have fun?

133
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,580
We're going to the hospital.

134
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,749
Don't speed.

135
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,392
Ju-ri. You can go without me.

136
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,811
I'll go with her.

137
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:51,942
Why?

138
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:53,694
It's just that...

139
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,784
I don't think she should drive alone.

140
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,388
If you didn't get in my car,

141
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,682
I was going to kidnap you.

142
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,269
Is that your hobby?

143
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,481
I know you were jealous of him
when he was having a blast.

144
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:35,069
"I want to put everything down
and have fun just like him."

145
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,613
I could tell from the look on your face.

146
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,991
Let me know when you're ready.

147
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:44,203
I'll kidnap you
and let you have the time of your life.

148
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,871
It will be magnificent.

149
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,877
Forget it.

150
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:56,090
Okay, fine.
When it looks like you want to run away,

151
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:59,135
I'll run away with you
right there and then.

152
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,011
Look forward to it.

153
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,082
Damn.

154
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,544
I hate flowers that fall petal by petal.

155
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,178
I like magnolias.

156
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:45,014
The whole flower falls at once
without hesitation.

157
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,265
I like that about them.

158
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,771
You really have a way of comparing things.

159
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,565
Beautiful comparison, isn't it?

160
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,655
Yes, magnolias sound like
the perfect flower for you.

161
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,741
What's your favorite flower?

162
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,453
I don't like them.

163
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,207
I don't like it when spring comes.

164
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:13,626
Why not?

165
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,299
Because that's when I need to leave again.

166
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:22,885
What?

167
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,263
Mr. Lee.

168
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,847
Yes, how did it go?

169
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:12,226
The injunction that was filed
against  Zombie Kid

170
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:13,602
got approved, sir.

171
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,607
Oh, I see.

172
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:23,654
Okay then. I guess we'll just
have to return everything. Right?

173
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:24,613
Yes.

174
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:26,448
Is this funny to you?

175
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,742
How could you be smiling?

176
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,495
The company is about to go bankrupt,
and you're smiling?

177
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,457
Then should I cry?

178
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,458
No.

179
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:38,294
Just leave.

180
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,046
Just write a resignation letter and leave.

181
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,395
I have

182
00:14:57,354 --> 00:15:00,149
finally found my red shoes.

183
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,326
INFORMATION ON MOON GANG-TAE

184
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,124
Mr. Lee, would you like some coffee?

185
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,126
Where are you going?

186
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,337
I'm going on a business trip.

187
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,714
Bye, sir.

188
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,095
Nice.

189
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,068
You wanted to eat,
and this is what you're buying me?

190
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,569
I'm in a hurry. My shift starts soon.

191
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,281
-Do you want a rice ball?
-Forget it.

192
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:55,788
Hello?

193
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:58,374
Just a second.

194
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:00,709
Go ahead and eat.

195
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,927
Darn, he didn't even buy any kimchi.

196
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,553
He really doesn't spend money.

197
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,889
I don't care if he's poor,
but I hate scrooges.

198
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,265
What brings you to call me?

199
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,393
Is everything okay?

200
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,310
What?

201
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,479
I'm relieved.

202
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,357
What is he saying?

203
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,276
Darn it.

204
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,904
Mr. Moon, let me ask you something.

205
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,865
Did Mun-yeong ever happen to tell you

206
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:36,662
that you're pretty
and that she wants to have you?

207
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,165
- Why me?
-Because I can't stop wanting you.

208
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,668
-But why?
-Because you're so pretty.

209
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,631
I guess she did. I'm sure of it.

210
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:49,758
What if she did?

211
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,928
Okay, listen to me carefully.

212
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,180
When she says she wants something,

213
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,641
she practically means she's hungry for it.

214
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:02,855
So in other words,
she's saying she's going to eat you alive.

215
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:07,609
What's your point?

216
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:12,114
My point is that you and I are both
in a state of emergency.

217
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,950
Her new book got banned from being sold,

218
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,370
so she can't afford to be
spending time with you right now.

219
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,039
She needs to start writing her next book.

220
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:24,918
His shoulders are so broad.

221
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,926
Anyway, I'll go there
and do everything I can to take her back.

222
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,471
So please stay alive... I mean...

223
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,390
Please hang in there until then.

224
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,517
Good luck.

225
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:53,655
Who was it?

226
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,159
-The hospital.
-Did they tell you to hurry?

227
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,286
Are they going to fire me?

228
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,457
You're very good at ignoring people.

229
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:04,833
Good for you.

230
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,298
I heard your new book

231
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,218
got banned from being sold.

232
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:15,969
Zombie Kid ?

233
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,724
Is it because of what you did last time
for my brother?

234
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:24,103
They wouldn't do that just because
I cursed and pulled at a man's hair.

235
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,772
They think the illustration and storyline
are too grotesque.

236
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:30,901
Those idiots can't read the actual message
that's hidden behind the letters.

237
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:31,944
Darn them.

238
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,323
What's the message?

239
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,619
You should read it.
I want to hear what you think about it.

240
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,579
I'm too old for fairy tales.

241
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:45,124
Oh, come on.
I think you're just the right age for it.

242
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,086
How old are you?

243
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,130
Me?

244
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,842
I'm just a little kid.

245
00:18:56,927 --> 00:19:00,264
But you're more like a kid than I am.

246
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,392
Why am I like a kid?

247
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,650
Because I can see that

248
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:13,694
you want to be loved.

249
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,286
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

250
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:26,934
Mom.

251
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,358
UNDER SEDATION
DO NOT DISTURB

252
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,368
About Assemblyman Kwon...

253
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,745
Judging by his personality,

254
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:49,289
he'll throw a fit
if he ends up having to resign.

255
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,458
Shouldn't we do something about it?

256
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,794
Get ready to get sued.

257
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:54,795
Again?

258
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,173
Oh, okay, sir.

259
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,843
Why don't you fire Ms. Ko Mun-yeong?

260
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,220
She kidnapped the patient.

261
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:06,306
Let's be honest. She didn't kidnap him.

262
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,059
He willingly got in her car.

263
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,645
But still, we need to fire her.

264
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:14,648
She never takes her father out for a walk.

265
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:18,151
She told me she never promised
to do such a thing.

266
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,361
Right, Ju-ri?

267
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:21,530
Yes.

268
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,199
You guys are acquainted, aren't you?

269
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,077
Yes.

270
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,912
What? Are you serious?

271
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:31,373
-What? How?
-Since when?

272
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,668
We knew each other for a while
when we were young.

273
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,420
Then you guys are practically friends.

274
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:41,425
What do you think
we should do about her, Ms. Nam?

275
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:43,927
I think

276
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,431
we should fire her.

277
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:48,724
Ms. Ko

278
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,935
doesn't belong here.

279
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,441
What are you going to do, sir?

280
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,986
We're not in a rush.

281
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,281
So let's check the patient's condition
and then decide.

282
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:05,949
Okay.

283
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:29,598
Don't turn it on.

284
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,183
I don't want to listen
to other people talking.

285
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,896
I want to hear you talk.
Just go ahead and say anything.

286
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:39,191
Well...

287
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,446
Do you have nothing to say to me?

288
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:50,118
Why don't you take
your father outside for walks?

289
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,703
You promised the hospital director.

290
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,122
"Promise"?

291
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,375
That stuff is useless like trash.

292
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,711
I got what I want,
so I don't need it anymore.

293
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:01,421
He has dementia.

294
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:04,382
His soul is dead.
His body is just an empty shell.

295
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,510
Why would I waste my time
on something like that?

296
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,097
It would be better if he just died.

297
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:14,518
Why did your parents pass away?

298
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,147
How do you know that?

299
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:21,608
I did my research.

300
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:27,072
It was just a simple background check.

301
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:30,492
It's just like how we check the origin
and expiration date of the stuff we buy.

302
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,994
So it's no big deal.

303
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:34,704
"Stuff"?

304
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,332
Are people like products to you?

305
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:38,750
What's the difference?

306
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,919
Children abandon their parents

307
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,838
when their parents become old and feeble.

308
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,757
Parents favor the child
that makes them happy

309
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,676
and abandon the child
that's dumb and useless.

310
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,303
Isn't that what happened to Teeny-weeny?

311
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:55,809
Stop the car.

312
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:57,310
What? Why?

313
00:23:57,894 --> 00:23:58,937
I said, stop the car.

314
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,106
Why? Do you need to pee?

315
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,493
What's with you all of a sudden?

316
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:14,536
Why are you angry?

317
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:16,329
Just tell me why.

318
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:18,373
Hey!

319
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,294
What are you so angry about?

320
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,006
I...

321
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:28,633
forgot.

322
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:30,552
What?

323
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,221
That you're different from others.

324
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,223
I forgot that for a while.

325
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:40,812
I must've unknowingly

326
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,274
expected something from you.

327
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,485
What did you expect from me?

328
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:53,950
What is it that you expected?

329
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,455
It's gone now.

330
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,169
I love you.

331
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,224
I love you, Gang-tae.

332
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:26,942
I love you!

333
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:28,860
I said, I love you!

334
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,987
I love you so much!

335
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:33,865
You're running away again?

336
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,533
I said I love you! Why are you leaving?

337
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,619
Why? I love you! Hey!

338
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,996
I love you! I really love you! Hey!

339
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,981
He's unbelievable.

340
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:09,901
We were getting along just fine.
Why did he explode all of a sudden?

341
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,112
Is he not right in his mind?

342
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,532
What in the world made him angry?

343
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:25,166
SEONGJIN VOCATIONAL SCHOOL

344
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,129
Gosh, that was hard.

345
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:31,506
Yes, I had a hard time.

346
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:32,757
Sang-tae.

347
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:40,890
What did you learn today?

348
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,143
How to make jam.

349
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:45,520
It sounds like fun. Strawberry jam?

350
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,230
It was boring.

351
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:50,233
I was bored to death.

352
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:55,905
I'm sorry, Sang-tae.

353
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,908
I couldn't find any schools
that teaches art in this neighborhood.

354
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,036
-Instead, I'll--
-I'm going to draw on the wall.

355
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,620
I'm going to draw on the hospital wall.

356
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:05,123
I'll draw, make money,
sweep the garden, and find coins.

357
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,334
That's what you call
"killing two birds with one stone."

358
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:11,671
Then are you going to provide for me now?
I should quit and have fun.

359
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,090
Don't... Don't worry. Just trust me.

360
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,425
I'm your older brother.

361
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:17,260
I'm the older brother,
so you can count on me.

362
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:21,514
Then should we buy the necessary tools?

363
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:26,061
-Is there an art supply store nearby?
-I'm your older brother, not your uncle.

364
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:49,417
Gosh, this place is so gloomy.

365
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,044
Why are you here?

366
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:54,297
How could anyone
live in a house like this,

367
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,883
let alone come up with ideas
to write anything?

368
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:01,805
Mun-yeong, let's go back to Seoul.

369
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:06,059
Go back to the luxurious hotel
and start writing your next book.

370
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:09,312
It's only been a few days
since we said I disappeared.

371
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:12,732
I forgot that you're not just a writer
but also a famous celebrity.

372
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,777
If you don't show your face to the public,
they'll easily forget about you.

373
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,779
You have no idea how quick
they forget things.

374
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,364
Things just disappear from their heads.

375
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,408
No, I don't want to go.
I'm going to have fun here.

376
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:25,078
Mun-yeong, can't you have fun in Seoul?

377
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,122
You... You shouldn't be here.

378
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:30,208
You know why. This is where your mother...

379
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:35,964
Then

380
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,051
why don't you move in with me?

381
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:41,511
What?

382
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:45,974
My gosh, you seem very tired.

383
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,144
You should get some good rest.
I'll call you again tomorrow.

384
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,061
I'll be off now.

385
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:12,292
That you're different from others.

386
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,960
I forgot that for a while.

387
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,021
You're different from others.

388
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:37,734
You're extremely special.

389
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:46,117
You're my greatest creation.

390
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,454
You are my other self.

391
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:53,208
I love you, my daughter.

392
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,141
-Here's your pizza.
-Excuse me.

393
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,727
-Yes?
-I read that you get a free caricature

394
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,271
when you order a full-size pizza.

395
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:59,440
Right, but it's only offered
during the daytime. I'm sorry.

396
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,067
Gosh, I've been baited.

397
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,028
I've totally been baited.

398
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:09,284
What kind of bait can I use to persuade
Mun-yeong to go back to Seoul with me?

399
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,079
Hey, Jae-su.

400
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:43,651
I'll get some wings

401
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,112
and a beer.

402
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:49,115
What's gotten into you? You never drink.

403
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,909
I'm just going to have one beer.

404
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,704
What? Something must've happened
at the hospital today.

405
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:55,663
No.

406
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:59,751
Gosh, whatever. I'll drink with you.

407
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:03,046
No, you should work. I'll just drink solo.

408
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,132
All right, then.

409
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,219
I'm here alone too.

410
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,975
Would you like to join me?

411
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,353
This pizza is way too big for one person.

412
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,814
I see, but no thanks.

413
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:24,317
Sorry about that.

414
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:44,921
What do you think
we should do about her, Ms. Nam?

415
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,005
I think

416
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,216
we should fire her.

417
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,471
Gosh. You're so petty, Nam Ju-ri.

418
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,599
What can you do though?

419
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:01,062
I have no choice but to suck up to her
to earn a living.

420
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,691
Still, she shouldn't be here.

421
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,109
She absolutely shouldn't.

422
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:09,529
She shouldn't be there. Never.

423
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:14,075
I'll take her back to Seoul with me
no matter what.

424
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,326
I have to.

425
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:22,792
Are they echoing each other?

426
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,213
It sounds like
they're talking about the same thing.

427
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,385
Put them in here.

428
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,805
Size 8, 12...

429
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:42,812
Where's size six? There it is.

430
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:44,605
Size seven...

431
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,425
I love you, Gang-tae.

432
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,385
I love you!

433
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,137
I said, I love you!

434
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,150
-So pretty.
- Because you're so pretty.

435
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:32,695
I want it.

436
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:35,364
Moon Gang-tae, what I want is you.
Because I can't stop wanting you.

437
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,075
When I see something pretty, I want it.

438
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,367
And I need to have what I want.

439
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,538
I want this.

440
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:43,664
I'm getting this.

441
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:48,169
Hello, I'm ready to pay.

442
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,378
My gosh, so many!

443
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:53,466
I'm taking all this.
Everything here except for the basket.

444
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,301
I'm getting so many things.

445
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:02,433
So many things.

446
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,938
-So many things.
-What's the total?

447
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:08,314
It's 53,000 won.

448
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:09,982
So many things.

449
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:12,151
Thank you.

450
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,570
Pteranodon. They have...

451
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,949
They have a throat sac
where they can store fish.

452
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:22,537
Flight muscles... Because of the weak
flight muscles, they can't really fly...

453
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,205
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

454
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:33,214
Let's get--

455
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,091
-Step aside.
-What is this?

456
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,551
Jeez, what's going on?

457
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,220
-A-reum, are you all right?
-They're scary.

458
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,138
They look like thugs.

459
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:44,350
All right!
Go back to your rooms and have some food!

460
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:45,643
-Let's go upstairs.
-Step aside.

461
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,398
Hey, who are those guys in suits?

462
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:51,315
Kwon Man-su's people.

463
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:57,196
Watching a fire is most entertaining,
but watching a fight comes in second.

464
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,156
Let's go.

465
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,241
No, I don't like it when people fight.

466
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,870
A bloody storm awaits.

467
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:08,583
Sir, there must've been
some misunderstanding.

468
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,877
Let me explain.

469
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:13,713
Please allow me to explain what happened!

470
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:16,591
Gosh.

471
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:22,763
Yes, what?

472
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:27,143
-Check.
-Let's just say that I lost this round.

473
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:28,394
I have a guest coming.

474
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,563
I was going to win anyway.

475
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,732
Issue me a pass to leave the hospital
as you promised.

476
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,784
The crazy bitch who kidnapped that lunatic

477
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,703
and brought him to my campaign rally,

478
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,581
the caregiver who helped that bitch,

479
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:52,084
and the hospital director who failed
to keep them under control

480
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:55,046
and ruined my reputation should all
get down on their knees in front of me.

481
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,006
Bring them to me now!

482
00:36:58,341 --> 00:36:59,926
Oh, the horse was here.

483
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,845
HORSE

484
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:04,680
Gang-tae!

485
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,351
You're in deep trouble.

486
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:09,727
You're fucking screwed.

487
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,188
What do we do?

488
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,482
Should I really call Ms. Ko?

489
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,108
What if she refuses to come?

490
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,485
She will, 100 percent.

491
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:18,903
I'll call her.

492
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,406
INSTRUCTOR CONTACTS

493
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:27,995
Don't call her.

494
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:30,706
Why not?

495
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,291
I'll just go in there alone.

496
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,460
Still, I should...

497
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,963
Don't. Seriously, don't.

498
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,138
What do we do?
Are we really not going to call her?

499
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,101
He told us not to call her, Byeol.

500
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,103
I'm sure he'll handle it.

501
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,148
Why is she taking it out on me?

502
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,279
"He told us not to call her."

503
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,994
Thank you! Thank you so much.

504
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:10,162
Thank you.

505
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:17,545
My gosh.

506
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,381
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

507
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:30,224
See? I clearly warned you.

508
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,198
Why did you come alone?

509
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,367
Where's that bitch, your accomplice?

510
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:52,621
She's not coming.
She doesn't need to be here.

511
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:55,750
She's the culprit.
Who said she doesn't need to be here?

512
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,628
Your son escaped the hospital
of his own accord.

513
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,048
-No one took him there against his will.
-Hey.

514
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,258
That idiot is not well.

515
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:08,220
He strips off his clothes out of the blue
and pees regardless of where he is.

516
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:11,974
And he spends tens of millions of won
in one night. He's insane!

517
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:15,311
I locked him away here so that
he wouldn't be able to wander around.

518
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,856
I can't believe you let him go
at my campaign rally of all places.

519
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:21,609
I bet you people did it on purpose.

520
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,861
Because I said
I'd shut this hospital down,

521
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:26,197
you folks egged that idiot on

522
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,240
to deliberately screw me over.

523
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:32,620
It may have screwed you over,

524
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:36,082
but your son's condition has improved
significantly thanks to that incident.

525
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:37,917
He's well enough to be discharged soon.

526
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,377
Are you out of your mind?

527
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:42,463
Who's going to keep an eye
on that moron if you discharge him?

528
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,007
It's kind of like how psychodrama works.

529
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:48,677
If you release your pent-up emotions
while having the spotlight on you--

530
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:49,595
Whatever.

531
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,433
There are thousands of
psychiatric hospitals in the country.

532
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:59,230
If I keep transferring him,
I can have him locked away forever!

533
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,566
Gosh, you can't do that to your own son.

534
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:06,112
I don't need a son
who is completely useless!

535
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,243
He's useless?

536
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:14,370
What?

537
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,583
Do children

538
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:23,129
have to be useful to their parents?

539
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,259
Hey.

540
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:31,720
We all

541
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,515
came into this world
because our parents needed us.

542
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,018
Go ask your parents.

543
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:41,897
Whether or not they will need you

544
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,899
if you're completely useless!

545
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,110
Then you shouldn't have had him!

546
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:47,445
You punk!

547
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:50,823
You're a mere caregiver. How dare you!

548
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,117
Jeez!

549
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:15,014
SMILING CAN REALLY MAKE YOU HAPPY

550
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:36,035
My gosh, you're adorable.

551
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,454
Okay, here. Smile.

552
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:46,128
How beautiful.

553
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,424
A fountain!

554
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:55,137
All right. One, two, three.

555
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:58,849
Nice. Let's go.

556
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,191
One, two, three.

557
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,741
One, two, three.

558
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:20,663
One,

559
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,915
two, three.

560
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:36,095
-Hey.
-Hello!

561
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,471
Can you take a photo of me?

562
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:38,556
Sure.

563
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:43,185
What a beautiful day.
The weather is so nice today.

564
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:46,021
Photos turn out great
when the weather is this nice. One...

565
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,983
No! Go away, butterfly!

566
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,818
A butterfly!

567
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,445
Gosh, that was a butterfly!

568
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:54,363
What's with him?

569
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,866
Did he not like my pose?

570
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,710
Goodness gracious. Can't you knock?

571
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:10,629
I did. You're not going to let
Assemblyman Kwon do what he wants, right?

572
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:12,464
I will.

573
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:14,800
Sir, please.

574
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:16,552
Come and have a look.

575
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:21,015
Gosh.

576
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:44,705
Then you shouldn't have had him!

577
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,040
You punk!

578
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:48,626
How dare you!

579
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:49,918
You're a mere caregiver.

580
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:52,838
I'm thinking of blackmailing him

581
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:56,967
with this footage,
saying that I'll send this to the media.

582
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:59,637
I'll also see if I can get him
to donate some money as well.

583
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,388
Are you serious?

584
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,015
Sure, why not?

585
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:06,101
As for Kwon Gi-do,
I'm sure the kidnapping incident

586
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:08,854
will actually help him get better.

587
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,314
Then all I need to do

588
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:14,693
is punish the jerk
who slapped our caregiver.

589
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:20,199
I've done nothing
to get on your wrong side, right?

590
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,873
The sky over on this side.
The sky is up here.

591
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:30,459
And the waves. The sea.

592
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:33,253
The sea should be here. Hello!

593
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:37,549
Then... The hospital should be
in the middle. After that, the sea...

594
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:38,676
The sea...

595
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:41,470
The swing. The swing is under it.

596
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:44,223
What is this? Is it something
only good people can see?

597
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:45,849
It's the sea.

598
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:57,027
Finally, we meet.

599
00:44:57,861 --> 00:44:59,196
My dear Sang-tae.

600
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,577
Oh, my. What should I do?

601
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:07,246
Hello.

602
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:09,331
My gosh.

603
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:11,583
Go on in first.

604
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:13,877
Sang-tae!

605
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,255
-Look at the camera.
-One.

606
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:19,758
Look up here. One, two, three.

607
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,932
My gosh! There, it's done.

608
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:34,440
Are you here
because you got a call from us?

609
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:36,358
What? You told me to pretend
not to know you.

610
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:39,611
What call?

611
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:43,365
Well, I was just wondering
because you don't have class today.

612
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:48,078
I'm here to take Ko Dae-hwan
out for a walk.

613
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:52,875
Someone got fuming mad at me
for not keeping my promise,

614
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,128
so I came here to cool him off.

615
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,630
Now, I'm just doing a service for a fan.

616
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:00,924
Yes, "service."
I know what "service" means.

617
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:03,385
You get a free caricature
when you order a full-size pizza.

618
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:07,431
Gosh, what's he saying?
This guy is so funny.

619
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:09,099
Girls like funny guys.

620
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:12,478
My gosh, I'm with writer Ko Mun-yeong.

621
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,330
Where are you, Sang-tae?

622
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:36,543
This is pretty. I like it.

623
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:45,761
It's 10,000 won.

624
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:48,138
You said earlier that it's free.

625
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:51,266
Did you order pizza?
You didn't have any pizza.

626
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:57,231
My gosh, what do I do with you?
You're so cute.

627
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:58,690
You have a dinosaur.

628
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:01,693
Come on.
TWICE is much cuter. Let's be real.

629
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:02,903
Don't touch his hair.

630
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,366
Are you still mad at me?

631
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,494
Look. I'm here
to take my father out for a walk.

632
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:12,704
You're mad
because I didn't keep my word, right?

633
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:17,709
Sang-tae, can you go wait in the lobby?

634
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:21,088
No, I don't want to.
I'm going to stay here with Ms. Ko.

635
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,340
-I'll stay here with Ms. Ko--
-Do as I say, please!

636
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:31,473
Just wait in the lobby.

637
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:33,976
I'll be right there.

638
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:38,897
-Sang-tae.
-Hey, did someone slap you?

639
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:46,029
Who slapped you in the face?

640
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:47,906
What happened to your face?

641
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:52,411
Who's the jerk that did this to you?
Who hit you?

642
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:53,996
I'll teach them a lesson. Tell me who.

643
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,457
I bet you just put up with it again.

644
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,710
You got hit and just put up with it
like a loser, right?

645
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:04,006
I asked you who did this to you.

646
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,174
Why are you getting angry?

647
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:07,759
What?

648
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:09,761
Why are you getting so worked up?

649
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:11,013
Because someone slapped you.

650
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,514
So what?

651
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:15,601
Does that break your heart?

652
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:21,148
Or does it make you sad?

653
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:28,113
What exactly are you feeling right now?

654
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,284
You

655
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:34,161
don't know

656
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:38,457
what kind of emotion is getting you
so worked up.

657
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:41,376
Even you have no clue.

658
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,464
You're all empty inside.

659
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,549
You're just loud.

660
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,719
Like an empty can.

661
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:54,723
So you'd better not

662
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,976
act like you know and understand
everything about me

663
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,353
when you know nothing.

664
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,689
Don't be delusional.

665
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:08,612
You won't understand me

666
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:12,407
until the day you die.

667
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:48,985
KANG SUN-DEOK

668
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:53,240
Hello?

669
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,285
Gosh, I don't want to. Why not?

670
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:58,912
Don't... Oh, no.

671
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:04,292
Your expression shows your emotions

672
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:06,044
Do as I say, please!

673
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:08,588
Annoyed.

674
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,674
He's annoyed.

675
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,093
He...

676
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:16,722
hates his brother.

677
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:22,269
He hates me. No, no. Gosh, what do I do?

678
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:23,687
Why...

679
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:27,607
Oh, it's a bunny.

680
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:31,737
Come out.
If you come out, I'll give you this.

681
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:37,200
Come on. I'll also make a turtle
with a radish for you.

682
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:41,538
Gosh.

683
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,668
Gang-tae is waiting for you outside.

684
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:48,712
Are you going to stay here
by yourself all night?

685
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:51,923
You need to come out
so that I can tidy up quickly and go home.

686
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,385
Sang-tae.

687
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:01,725
Come on. Let's go home. Come out.

688
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:03,810
-Gosh, this way. Goodness.
-No, I don't want to go.

689
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:06,062
Come out. My goodness!

690
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:09,941
Oh, no. My back...

691
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:13,445
No, not this.

692
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:18,074
Gosh, my back.

693
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:25,457
-Where's Sang-tae?
-I'll bring him home later.

694
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,709
Don't worry about him
and just get going. Here.

695
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:32,422
I'm sorry to make you do this.

696
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:33,924
Why are you sorry? Don't be.

697
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:35,550
Go on.

698
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:37,928
Gang-tae.

699
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,472
Don't eat dinner and wait for me.

700
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:43,433
I'll make delicious beef stir-fry
when I get home.

701
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:29,563
I'll tag along the first few times
just in case anything happens.

702
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,824
Are you sure
all your memories got wiped out?

703
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:44,244
You're not just pretending?

704
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,580
Stop provoking him.

705
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:04,014
Did you

706
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:08,351
really forget what kind of person I am?

707
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:11,271
Dad.

708
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:23,909
You...

709
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:25,952
Why...

710
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:28,788
are you

711
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,167
still alive?

712
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:47,974
Die.

713
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:52,395
Die, you...

714
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:53,480
Go quickly.

715
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:55,899
You monster!

716
00:53:55,982 --> 00:54:00,654
-Stop, Mr. Ko!
-Die, you... You monster.

717
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:03,865
Over here, help!

718
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:06,993
Die, you... You monster.

719
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:08,453
Calm him down.

720
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,122
You're a monster.

721
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:03,466
It serves you right.
You shouldn't have come here.

722
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:17,188
Ms. Ko,  The Little Mermaid
from last class...

723
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:19,816
She ignored me.

724
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,568
I think she hates me.

725
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,236
No, she doesn't.

726
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:26,614
"If you talk to me, I'll kill you."
It's written on her forehead.

727
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:28,992
I didn't see that.

728
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:31,870
Oh, your medication must be wearing off.

729
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:33,830
Come on. You should take your pills.

730
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:03,586
So you'd better not act like you know
and understand everything about me

731
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,004
when you know nothing.

732
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,464
Don't be delusional.

733
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:10,468
You won't understand me
until the day you die.

734
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:11,613
You don't know what kind of emotion
is getting you so worked up.

735
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:13,364
Even you have no clue.

736
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:15,074
You're all empty inside.

737
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:16,910
You're just loud.

738
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:19,662
Like an empty can.

739
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:23,416
You also won't be able to understand me

740
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:26,085
until the day you die.

741
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:02,413
ZOMBIE KID

742
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:19,973
"A baby boy was born in a small village.

743
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:23,017
He had pale skin

744
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:26,062
and large eyes.

745
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:28,815
While raising the boy,

746
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:31,276
his mother
naturally came to the realization

747
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:37,657
that he had no feelings whatsoever.

748
00:59:38,783 --> 00:59:41,619
All he had was the desire to eat,
like a zombie.

749
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:51,004
So his mother locked him up
in the basement

750
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:53,464
so that the villagers wouldn't see him.

751
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:56,259
And every night, she stole livestock
from her neighbors to feed him.

752
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:59,095
That's how she raised him in secret.

753
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:02,348
One night, she'd steal a chicken.

754
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:04,559
The next day, she'd steal a pig.

755
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:08,187
A number of years passed like that.

756
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:12,817
Then one day, an epidemic broke out.
It left the remaining animals dead,

757
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,820
and it also killed many people.

758
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,365
Those who survived the epidemic

759
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:22,035
left the village.

760
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:26,497
But the mother
couldn't leave her son all alone.

761
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:29,292
And to appease her son crying of hunger,

762
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:32,420
she cut off one leg of hers
and gave it to him.

763
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:35,298
After that, it was her arm.

764
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:37,800
She gave him all her limbs.

765
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:40,219
When she was left
with nothing but her torso,

766
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:43,389
she embraced her son for the last time

767
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:46,059
- to let him devour what was left of her."
-Come here.

768
01:00:46,392 --> 01:00:48,353
-It's cold.
-Gosh, it's raining. Come here.

769
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:50,063
-Here, come here.
-Mom, wait.

770
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:51,731
HARIMGAK

771
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:53,107
Come here, Gang-tae.

772
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:54,734
Gang-tae, come on.

773
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:54,669
"With his both arms,

774
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:58,339
the boy tightly held his mother's torso

775
01:01:59,757 --> 01:02:01,676
and spoke for the first time in his life.

776
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:05,972
-'Mom.
-"Mom.

777
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:09,475
-You're...
-You're...

778
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:12,228
so warm.'"

779
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:13,521
so warm."

780
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:54,979
You're different from others.

781
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:56,773
You're extremely special.

782
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:01,569
You're my greatest creation.

783
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:06,783
Why are you still alive?

784
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:11,370
What did the boy really want?

785
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:13,998
Satiating his hunger?

786
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,877
Or feeling his mother's warmth?

787
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:13,099
Oh, boy. Hey, it's pouring outside.

788
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:22,275
Hey, are you all right?

789
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:25,820
Ju-ri called.

790
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,572
She asked me to check in on you.

791
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:32,660
I heard you got slapped again.

792
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:36,163
Enough, seriously.
Things like this really upset me.

793
01:04:38,332 --> 01:04:39,917
Are you doing this on purpose or what?

794
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:48,551
By the way, I heard Ko Mun-yeong's father
choked her and caused a huge scene.

795
01:04:49,176 --> 01:04:50,177
What?

796
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:52,847
When? Who said that?

797
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:56,017
I overheard some patients talking about it
when I went there to deliver an order.

798
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:59,228
It sounded like a lot of people saw it.

799
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:04,984
He must hate his daughter so much
for him to choke her like that.

800
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:06,736
Her father is obviously not sane.

801
01:05:06,819 --> 01:05:08,321
-Jae-su.
-Yes?

802
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:12,158
-I need to borrow your motorcycle.
-Hey, what? It's raining now.

803
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:14,869
Hey, Gang-tae! Wait!

804
01:05:16,662 --> 01:05:17,496
Oh, boy.

805
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:20,082
Why is he being like that?

806
01:08:28,687 --> 01:08:31,440
SPECIAL THANKS TO KWAK DONG-YEON
FOR MAKING A GUEST APPEARANCE

807
01:09:06,308 --> 01:09:08,894
Do you like me?

808
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:10,396
Damn it.

809
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:12,273
You must've been
a servant in your past life.

810
01:09:13,107 --> 01:09:14,275
And I must've been a mistress.

811
01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:15,526
Get out!

812
01:09:15,609 --> 01:09:17,778
-Why do you keep siding with her?
-Let go.

813
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:19,613
You don't own me.

814
01:09:21,031 --> 01:09:22,032
I want to forget.

815
01:09:22,616 --> 01:09:23,993
She saved my life,

816
01:09:24,618 --> 01:09:25,870
but I ran.

817
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:28,414
I hung out with him because I was bored.

818
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:32,877
Do you want to come pick him up?
We're at the cursed castle.

819
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:38,507
