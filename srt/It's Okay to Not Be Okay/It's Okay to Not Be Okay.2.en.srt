1
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,558
Then why are you here?

2
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:01,770
If not for money or sex,
what are you here for?

3
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,814
I was hoping

4
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,652
I could see you

5
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:11,821
again.

6
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:14,657
Your eyes.

7
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,578
I wanted to see them again.

8
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,415
My eyes?

9
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:24,751
Your eyes

10
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:29,089
remind me of someone I used to know.

11
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:32,884
Who is that person?

12
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:36,471
Someone who's messed up.

13
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,724
Help me. Help!

14
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,312
Shall I help him?

15
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:50,485
Or not?

16
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,793
Wait.

17
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:15,510
A woman

18
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,806
whose eyes

19
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,308
utterly lacked warmth.

20
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:30,400
That woman...

21
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,197
Were you afraid of her?

22
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,202
No, the opposite.

23
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:41,846
I liked her.

24
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:55,693

OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

26
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,911
Are you making a move on me now?

27
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:10,541
I remind you of the girl
in your beautiful memories?

28
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,670
I never said they were beautiful.

29
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,563
Do you still like me?

30
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,655
Don't get it wrong.

31
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,199
They're not good memories.

32
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:45,576
Is that so?

33
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:50,832
But you know what?

34
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,126
Bad memories

35
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:57,088
stay here longer.

36
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,063
Hey, I can't believe
you let them run into each other!

37
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,523
You should've stopped her.

38
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,735
Well, Ms. Ko showed up unannounced.

39
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,987
Does she ever give us a heads-up?

40
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,530
Gosh, seriously.

41
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,034
If you lack foresight,
you should've fought with all your might.

42
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,994
Unbelievable! Why do I even pay you?

43
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,916
I want to punch him, even just once.

44
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:44,135
Go tell Mr. Lee that I understand
how tough his job must be.

45
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,053
What?

46
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:48,056
But he doesn't need
to go to such lengths for me,

47
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,724
so tell him not to call me again.

48
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,900
My gosh.

49
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,403
I'm very late, aren't I?
The traffic was awful.

50
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,530
How about we talk
over some sweet beverage?

51
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,074
No, it's okay.

52
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,909
Oh, you're leaving already?

53
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,952
Don't forget to get Ms. Ko's autograph.

54
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,625
My autograph?

55
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,794
-Well, that's--
-Earlier, you asked me

56
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,755
to get Ms. Ko's autograph for you.

57
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,094
The spiel about my eyes

58
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:29,097
and that girl in your memories

59
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,557
was all for my autograph?

60
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:34,143
No.

61
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,937
So you weren't after money or sex.

62
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,398
My autograph was what you wanted.

63
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,024
I said, no.

64
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,859
My gosh, this is perfect.

65
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,820
We can call this
an impromptu fan meeting.

66
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,280
-Why don't we drink this--
-I'll give you one.

67
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,323
My autograph.

68
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,749
This is my newest book, hot off the press.

69
00:06:59,043 --> 00:06:59,919
All right.

70
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,505
Name?

71
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,301
Name?

72
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,139
Moon...

73
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:13,558
Sang-tae.

74
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,728
Who's Sang-tae? Is he your nephew?

75
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,314
No, he's my brother.

76
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:24,277
I see. Your brother is a fan of hers.

77
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:27,780
Right, Mun-yeong has fans of all ages
and nationalities.

78
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,616
She has a huge fanbase.

79
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,826
Congratulations.

80
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,703
-Consider these fan goods--
-Here.

82
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,215
I'll be off, then.

83
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,301
See you again.

84
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,556
I don't think so.

85
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:58,269
Gosh, I have to make sure he takes this.

86
00:07:58,686 --> 00:07:59,562
Mr. Moon!

87
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:01,856
Mr. Moon.

88
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,985
Mr. Moon, please. Hold on a second.

89
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,778
Goodness, just a second--

90
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,198
Gosh, my apologies.

91
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:15,411
I'm truly sorry about what happened,
so please take this.

00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,293
50,000 WON

93
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,046
This is too much for myself.

94
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,840
Well, then you can share it
with the people around you.

95
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,300
-Oh, I see.
-Yes.

96
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:31,719
Shall I do that, then?

97
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,473
Gosh, hey! No!

98
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,308
Hey, don't... Hey!

99
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:45,733
Hey, jeez.

100
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,738
I don't need this, so don't follow me.

101
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,242
But... Wait.

102
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,998
I've been cleaning up after Mun-yeong
for ten years,

103
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,917
and no one has ever said no to this.

104
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,002
What an oddball.

105
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,172
Gosh, I have a bad feeling about this.

106
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,259
Should I have offered him two boxes?

107
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:28,859
Beautiful.

108
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,197
I want him.

109
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,642
I want him.

110
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,561
I want him.

111
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,615
Did you ask for me?

112
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,789
You said you want to be given
a proper task.

113
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:28,085
Yes, just tell me what you need.
I'll do anything.

114
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,589
Do some digging on the man who just left.

115
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,845
-Pardon?
-If you tell Mr. Lee,

116
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:42,600
I'll pull out your tongue,
so keep this a secret.

Your landlady stopped by
early in the morning and lashed out at me.

122
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,052
Gross. It has your saliva on it.

123
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,595
It's gross. Your saliva.

124
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,890
Cover your mouth when you cough.
It's better than catching a virus.

Are you working as a driver or something?

128
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:35,986
What? Ko Mun-yeong?

129
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,199
What? Her autograph?

130
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,414
Okay, bye.

131
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,254
He got it.

Gosh, hold on!

133
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,590
Wait up. Can't we finish the food?

00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,759
Hey! Wait!

Dear Sang-tae. I hope you can come

go persuade my landlady, and--

145
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,923
I want an outfit
that'll make me look smart

146
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,718
like an Oxford University student.

147
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,387
I should also tie up loose ends
at all my part-time jobs.

Yes.

152
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:57,359
All right. Text me the time and location.

00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,029

Yes, this one's cool.

-Well…

00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,314
I have to go back this evening,
so I can't drink.

-How about Coke?
-Sure.

00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,202
Well... All is good, right?

186
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,496
Yes, as you can see.

187
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,665
No, I mean...

188
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,417
Gang-tae.

189
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:07,716
Yes. He's doing well,
getting joy out of overworking himself.

190
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,431
Are you hurt?

191
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:16,600
No, I'm okay.

192
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:20,062
Take it easy. Your wage won't go up
even if you work that hard.

193
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,607
They say one must seek out hard work
while still young, but that's bullshit.

194
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,193
Gosh, you'll see when you're older.

195
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:30,030
You'll suffer from body aches all over
and get sick all the time.

196
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:40,207
That young man is so unyielding.

197
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,654
All right, let's start the meeting.

198
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:11,697
-Okay.
-Yes, sir.

199
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,783
I'll start with the reviews.

200
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,493
Most reviewers said

201
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:20,622
that the illustrations are too grotesque.

202
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:25,544
Ms. Ko's other books were also criticized
for being too cruel.

203
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,422
I'm afraid the illustrations are adding
to that this time.

204
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:31,258
-Right. Then we should--
-Just leave it the way it is.

205
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:34,261
Yes, we'll just leave it the way it is.

206
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,637
All right, what's next?

207
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,391
About Ms. Ko's book that'll be adapted
into an animated film in the US…

208
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,101
You mean,  The Ugly Dog's Puppy?

209
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,102
Right.

210
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,063
They called and said

211
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,357
that they want to change the dog character
to a cat.

212
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:50,277
Tell them to keep it as is.
Otherwise, I'll annul the contract.

213
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,697
Mun-yeong, then we'll suffer big losses...

214
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,574
Then would you rather die?

215
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,620
Seung-jae! You think
it's okay to turn a dog into a cat

216
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:02,664
without the author's permission?
They're different species.

217
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,000
Tell them to stick
to the original characters.

218
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,294
Are you leaving?

219
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,633
Make sure the signing event tomorrow
ends within an hour.

220
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,179
The faster we get everything done,
the better.

221
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,140
YOO SEUNG-JAE

222
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,558
Okay, Seung-jae?

223
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:29,817
Hello?

224
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,278
Uncle, I need you to do
a background check on someone.

225
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,865
I know a police officer
shouldn't do stuff like that.

226
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:40,369
Then do you know anyone who works
at the National Intelligence Service

227
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,162
or at a private detective agency--

228
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,081
Hello?

229
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,335
Gosh, what do I do?

230
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,340
Thanks for your hard work.

231
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:56,176
You're so capable.
I'm sad that you're leaving.

232
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:57,803
Gang-tae.

233
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,806
Someone's looking for you.

234
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,215
You hurt your hand.

235
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,553
I hurt it a little while working.

236
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,649
I'm all sweaty.

237
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:01,116
Jae-su told me
that I'd be able to find you here.

238
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,242
I see.

239
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,953
I heard you're moving again.

240
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:09,416
You can leave whenever you want
without being attached.

241
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:10,667
I envy you.

242
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,256
Have you decided
which hospital to work at?

243
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,259
I'm sure I'll find something.

244
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,262
I'm not sure if it's good or bad,

245
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,723
but new psychiatric hospitals
keep opening.

246
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,144
My hospital is looking
for an experienced caregiver.

247
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,856
It's called OK Psychiatric Hospital.

248
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:34,983
Eight-hour rotating shifts.

249
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,027
You'll get ten days off each month,

250
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,614
so you can pick up a part-time job
on the side if you'd like.

251
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:45,118
And you're a certified nursing assistant,
so you'll get extra pay.

252
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,537
Where is the hospital?

253
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,207
In Seongjin City, our hometown.

254
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,543
You said you also lived there
when you were little.

255
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:57,673
A bunch of areas have been redeveloped,
so it no longer has that small-town vibe.

256
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:02,052
Also, a multiplex theater
opened recently and...

257
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,695
Mom.

258
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:23,198
Mom!

259
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,410
Bring my mom back.

260
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,079
Mom.

261
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,832
Mom, no.

262
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:34,293
-Mom, open your eyes.
-The butterfly did it.

263
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,712
I mean, I saw it.

264
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:37,796
-Mom!
-The butterfly…

265
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:39,923
Mom, no.

266
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,301
-Mom, please open your eyes.
-The butterfly

267
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:43,927
killed Mom.

268
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:45,846
The butterfly...

269
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,142
The butterfly killed her.

270
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,060
I saw it.

271
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,271
The butterfly did it.

272
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,192
Sang-tae! Tell us exactly what you saw.

273
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,737
Was it a man or a woman? How old?

274
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,489
What did this person look like?
Did you hear the voice?

275
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,868
The butterfly said it'd kill me as well

276
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,495
if I didn't keep my lips sealed.

277
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:13,248
It said it'd chase me down

278
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,169
and kill me!

279
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,757
We should send the younger one
to a care center

280
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:26,970
and his older brother to a center
that takes care of handicapped children.

281
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,724
That would probably be best for them both.

282
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,477
Okay. We'll leave him in your hands.

283
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,563
Sang-tae, let's go.

284
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:42,277
Come on.

285
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,623
Where are we headed?

286
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,126
To a place
where the butterfly can't find us.

287
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,380
Somewhere far?

288
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:03,673
Yes, far away.

289
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:30,200
You must be tired.

290
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,412
I could've come alone.

291
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,082
Get on the bus. You'll arrive very late.

292
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,209
Bye, then.

293
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,468
Hey, Gang-tae.

294
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:51,012
There's an empty room at my place.

295
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:52,889
I mean...

296
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:57,686
No one uses the room.
My mom and I only use the first floor.

297
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:02,232
If you actually end up
moving back to Seongjin City,

298
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,943
you won't have to look for a place.

299
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,573
Bye now, for real.

300
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,584
Thanks for your concern,

301
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:23,628
but I won't go there.

302
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,130
Why not?

303
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,134
Because it's a countryside?

304
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:33,680
Yes.

305
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,183
That's why.

306
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,877
Ju-ri, I don't know if you know this.

307
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:08,089
Gang-tae, that poor thing,

308
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:13,011
never builds deep relationships.

309
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,097
He'll leave eventually anyway,

310
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:20,352
so he thinks it's pointless to build
a relationship that will only last a year.

311
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:30,820
Why…

312
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:31,738
Right,

313
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,450
but why does he have to leave?

314
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,202
It's because...

315
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:38,620
What's the reason?

316
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:41,081
You see, it's all...

317
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:48,755
It's all because of that damn butterfly.

318
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:50,674
Darn it.

319
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:55,595
"Butterfly"?

320
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:09,526
A butterfly?

321
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:30,672
See you again.

322
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,799
I don't think so.

-Oh, is this it?
-My gosh!

362
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,622
Gosh! What are you doing?

363
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,165
-I'm sorry.
-All right.

364
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:21,880
-Wait, Sang-tae.
-Yes.

365
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,214
Sang-tae!

366
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,592
-Listen up.
-Okay.

367
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:28,136
-You see the restroom over there, right?
-Yes.

368
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:29,888
-You see it?
-Yes.

369
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,473
When you're getting her autograph later,

370
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:35,101
I'll be watching you
from exactly that distance,

371
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:37,562
-so get that woman's autograph--
-Ms. Ko Mun-yeong?

372
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,480
Right. After you get Ms. Ko's autograph

373
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,191
and take a picture with her,
we'll head home right away.

374
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,361
-Then what will you get?
-The dinosaur encyclopedia.

375
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,448
Don't run. Sang-tae!

376
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,950
-Let's go.
-Slow down.

377
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,304
-Sang-tae.
-What?

378
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,680
Wait in line.

379
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,391
-Wait here, okay?
-Okay.

380
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,727
-I'll be over there.
-Okay.

381
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,647
Okay, let's go.

382
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,691
I'm getting her autograph.

383
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,911
DO HUI-JAE'S POSTHUMOUS WORK

384
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:37,538
THE MURDER OF THE WITCH OF THE WEST

385
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,840
WRITTEN BY DO HUI-JAE

386
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,807
The mother is the queen
of detective fiction.

387
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,643
Her daughter, children's literature.

388
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,687
They're quite something.

389
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:06,275
My goodness,
what brings a busy man like you here?

390
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:09,112
I had to come to congratulate you
on the new release.

391
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:12,991
As you know, I exclusively review
and critique Ko Mun-yeong's books.

392
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:16,160
Right, that's true.

393
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:20,999
Seven of her books are in the top ten list
of the best-selling children's books.

394
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,083
BOOKS OF THE MONTH

395
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,751
I have to say, it's impressive.

396
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,671
Do you think
it's because of Ko Mun-yeong's looks?

397
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:29,215
Gosh, come on.
It's not because of her looks.

398
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:30,550
She's a great writer.

399
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:33,302
All right, let's not stand around here.

400
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:36,723
Why don't we go somewhere
and drink something sweet?

401
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,766
-Let's go.
-Goodness, what's with you?

402
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,102
Come on. It's okay.

403
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:44,313
What's with you? I'm diabetic.

404
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:47,316
Come on. You'll be fine. Excuse us.

405
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:08,296
The sun is...

406
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,883
What time is it? What? I'm late!

407
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,137
What the fuck, 18 calls?

408
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,014
I'm so dead.

409
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,058
Shit, what do I do?

410
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:25,938
Jeez.

411
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,235
-Sang-tae, I have to take a call.
-Okay.

412
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,487
-Stay right here.
-Okay.

413
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:41,746
Gosh!

414
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:45,249
My, it's a stegosaurus.
A real stegosaurus. Hi, stegosaurus.

415
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,751
-A stegosaurus.
-My gosh.

416
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:49,796
This is a stegosaurus.
It means "roofed lizard."

417
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,255
You don't need to come.

418
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,340
The plates.

419
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,717
It's characterized
by the plates along the back.

420
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,386
They probably lived
in the late Jurassic Period.

421
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,138
-Scientists…
-What's wrong with him?

422
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,181
What's with you?

423
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:03,476
My gosh, this stegosaurus is huge!

424
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:06,270
It has a small brain
despite its large size--

425
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:07,814
Get lost!

426
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,399
-My gosh.
-Oh, no!

427
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,318
I have a toy that looks just like it.

428
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:15,446
Here, this looks just like it.
This is my stegosaurus toy.

429
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:19,158
Its name is Teary--

430
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,952
-I've been too nice, right?
-My hair.

431
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,120
-Get out.
-My hair.

432
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,788
-My hair. Let go!
-Get out.

433
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:25,206
-I said, get out!
-My hair...

434
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,499
-Get out.
-No, my hair!

435
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:27,959
Don't touch my hair!

436
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:30,670
My hair... Don't touch my hair.

437
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,256
My hair...

438
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:36,092
Don't touch my hair.

439
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:40,847
My hair! Don't touch my hair!

440
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:43,891
Don't touch my hair. Go away!

441
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,108
Sorry, excuse me.

442
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,198
-No, my hair...
-Sang-tae, I'm sorry.

443
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,950
-My hair...
-I'm sorry, Sang-tae.

444
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,994
-You're okay now.
-I'm okay.

445
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,997
-It's okay. I'm sorry.
-I'm okay.

446
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,500
-You're okay now, Sang-tae.
-I'm okay now. I'm sorry.

447
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:13,129
I'm okay now.

448
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:15,298
I'm okay now. I'm sorry.

449
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:16,215
It's okay.

450
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,467
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

451
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:19,719
Shall I help him?

452
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:22,847
Or not?

453
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:26,726
Shall I help him?

454
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,645
Or not?

455
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,991
Hey!

456
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,666
You need to apologize.

457
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:55,796
You.

458
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:57,798
Apologize.

459
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:03,137
-Why should I apologize to him?
-No, to me.

460
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:04,305
What?

461
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:07,725
You totally ruined my book signing event.

462
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:09,727
Why is that my fault? This fucking--

463
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,854
Goodness!

464
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,606
Gosh!

465
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:17,068
Who wouldn't scream when someone
grabs them by the hair like this?

466
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,240
See? You're screaming too.

467
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,242
Let go. I said, let go!

468
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,954
-Let go.
-Listen.

469
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:30,831
This lunatic was harassing our son.
What did you expect?

470
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,166
Shit. I'm so screwed.

471
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,919
Are you a psychiatrist?
How do you know he's a lunatic?

472
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:36,087
Well, that's...

473
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,675
I can tell because he kept rambling on

474
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:42,969
about things that make no sense!

475
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:45,471
Crazy bitch.

476
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:47,390
-My gosh.
-Did she really say that?

477
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,308
-What's with her?
-What did you say?

478
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:53,145
Well, you kept rambling on
about things that make no sense,

479
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,815
so I thought you were crazy.

480
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:00,653
My gosh. Honey, you heard that, right?

481
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,781
You all heard that, right?
She swore at me just now.

482
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,992
What are you people doing? Record this!

483
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,910
Yes! Record a video!

484
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,663
-I'm speechless.
-Film this!

485
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:27,680
I'm okay. I'm not a bad person.

486
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,100
I'm okay. I'm not a bad person.

487
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:35,896
I'm not a bad person.

488
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,856
INVENTORY

489
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:47,450
-Shouldn't you check on him?
-He'll let me in when he's calmed down.

490
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:50,369
-When would that be?
-Usually in an hour.

491
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,080
A day or two at the most.

492
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,963
I have to stay here all night then?

493
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:05,217
I never asked you to.

494
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,596
Don't worry.
Just go sort out the situation.

495
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,265
"Don't worry"?
Why would I worry? About whom?

496
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,775
By the way, the back of his head
must be very sensitive.

497
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:24,028
Is that his erogenous zone or something?

498
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,739
Oh, it's like a detonator.

499
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:30,409
When it's set off, the bomb goes off.
Then how does he get haircuts?

500
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:34,205
Will he go like this again? "No!"

501
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:36,832
Enough, okay?

502
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,211
Now, you're looking at me.

503
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:01,982
What are you doing?

504
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:04,527
Don't wear hats.

505
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,613
I can't see your pretty face.

506
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:15,955
Why is your face turning red?

507
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:22,878
Your forehead must be
your erogenous zone, right?

508
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,972
Hey, Ms. Ko!

509
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,016
You caused trouble again.

510
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:39,311
Mr. Lee will be really stressed out
this time.

511
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,401
Gosh, seriously!

512
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:49,655
Why does she get herself in trouble
whenever I'm not around?

513
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:54,702
She acts up
whenever that caregiver shows up.

514
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,620
Hey, if you knew that,

515
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:59,498
why didn't you make sure
they wouldn't run into each other?

516
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,750
Gosh, why do I even pay you?

517
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:10,426
Hi, Reporter Kim.

518
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:13,012
Gosh, no. She never said, "Crazy bitch."

519
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:15,431
She said,
"Gosh, this is driving me crazy."

520
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:18,142
People mishear things all the time,
you know.

521
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,062
That fucking prick.

522
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:26,066
Your boyfriend?

523
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,736
My gosh, you're dating?

524
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,947
If you got those boxes,
just shut up and leave.

525
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:35,868
Gosh, you look exactly like your mother
now that you have a frown face.

526
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,913
Your mother was not only a great writer,

527
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:41,624
but she was also very sexy.

528
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,461
You have a lot in common with your mother.

529
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,134
Cut the nonsense and just leave.

530
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,970
Things might be great now,

531
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:58,140
but I advise you to be careful.

532
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:02,186
Her mother, who was a famous writer,

533
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:04,396
suddenly passed away.

534
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:08,275
And her father, a successful architect,
went nuts

535
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:11,529
and got locked up
in a psychiatric hospital.

536
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,449
Then what do you think will happen to you?

537
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,371
You won't end up well
if you get involved with her.

538
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,123
Keep that in mind.

539
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:36,512
Let me go.

540
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:45,020
Don't go.

541
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:52,570
Do you like me?

542
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:58,325
Are you going to look after me?
Do you think you can handle it?

543
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,202
Who are you to stop me?

544
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:50,085
I was right.

545
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:52,755
I knew you'd come after me.

546
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:56,634
I've been reading your books
for quite a long time now.

547
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:58,802
You can easily see

548
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:02,014
how that writer thinks and feels
through their writing.

549
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:07,311
Then I guess you also know
what I'm going to do next.

550
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,774
Don't mess with me.

551
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:13,442
I won't go down alone.

552
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:17,154
I'll take you and Mr. Lee down with me.

553
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,658
Why do you think
they call me the Suicide Bomber?

554
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:24,953
A jerk who never goes down
without taking others with you?

555
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,667
I can destroy your career
with the tip of my pen.

556
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,126
I'm sure you know that.

557
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:33,962
A famous children's book writer

558
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:35,964
actually turned out to have

559
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:38,050
an antisocial personality disorder?

560
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:42,596
What do you think will happen
when people find out?

561
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,102
What do you want?

562
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:50,896
I'm starting to get tired and bored

563
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:53,774
of receiving these boxes.

564
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:56,902
I think it'd be nice

565
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:02,491
if you'd be kind enough to humor me

566
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:04,910
a little.

567
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:17,172
That's easy.

568
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:20,676
But I, too,

569
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:29,977
can attack you with the tip of my pen.

570
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:49,997
Goodbye.

571
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:09,600
911 EMERGENCY

572
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:12,686
You evil bitch!

573
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:18,066
You just wait! I swear I'll get rid of--

574
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,485
Loosen your neck, sir.

575
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:27,951
Damn, he should've just died.

576
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:31,246
Why do all jerks have a long lifespan?

577
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,331
Damn it.

578
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:33,832
Stop right there.

579
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,005
What are you doing?

580
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:42,549
Take in a deep breath.

581
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:47,429
Deeper.

582
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,893
-What--
-Close your eyes.

583
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,610
When you can't control yourself,

584
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:07,783
cross your arms like this

585
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,118
and take turns tapping on each shoulder.

586
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:15,916
This will help you calm down.

587
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:22,089
What is this?

588
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,424
The Butterfly Hug Method.

589
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:34,434
It's a self-healing technique
that's recommended for trauma patients.

590
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,153
It's no fun to have you stand behind me.

591
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:53,704
A trauma

592
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:58,709
should be faced head-on like this
instead of handling it from behind.

593
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:38,665
Why are you running away?

594
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:40,876
I'm going to my brother.

595
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,377
Slow down. My feet hurt.

596
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:46,131
Hey.

597
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:47,716
Hey!

598
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:53,055
Don't make me get angry. I'll explode.

599
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:54,681
That's why I taught you that.

600
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,141
That stuff is useless.

601
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:59,937
-I want you to be my safety pin.
-What?

602
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:03,565
Keep me under control
so that I won't explode.

603
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:06,735
You told me not to.
You told me I had no right to stop you.

604
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:07,861
You hold grudges.

605
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,196
Yes, that's right.

606
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:13,742
So I'm giving you the right to be
Ko Mun-yeong's safety pin.

607
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:17,412
-Why would I be your safety pin?
-Because you're a caregiver.

608
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,167
Isn't it your job to care
for potential patients?

609
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:27,172
Ask someone else.

610
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:30,968
I'll pay you a lot.
How much do you want?

611
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:39,434
We always say this to patients
who fully recover.

612
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,395
What's that?

613
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,022
"Hope I never see you again."

614
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:47,275
Please.

615
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:50,320
Let's not meet again.

616
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,156
I really want you to stop.

617
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:54,616
Stop following me.

618
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:07,963
But I'm not a patient.

619
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:11,842
"Hope I never see you again."

620
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:14,845
That's what you say to your patients.
But I'm fine.

621
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:16,430
You're right.

622
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:19,349
You're different from patients.

623
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:21,018
Exactly.

624
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,645
Drugs and injections can't cure you.

625
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,523
You were just born that way.

626
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:30,402
So there's no way to treat you.
And you have a poor prognosis.

627
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:33,613
It's just best

628
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:35,949
to avoid people like you.

629
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,333
You're not avoiding me.

630
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:48,920
You're just running away
because you're scared.

631
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:54,051
You coward.

632
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:19,493
Hey.

633
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:50,899
Do you

634
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:54,111
still like me?

635
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:14,840
Coward.

636
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:30,647
Mun-yeong.

637
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:33,316
How are you going to deal with this?

638
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,569
There were tons of witnesses!

639
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:38,738
Why are you always ruining
your own career?

640
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:40,740
What were you doing? Were you smoking?

641
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:42,909
-Yes.
-My gosh, come on.

642
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,035
Mun-yeong!

643
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:47,998
Why don't you just kill me?

644
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:57,966
Sang-tae.

645
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,946
Are you upset
that you didn't get her autograph?

646
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,492
If you are upset,

647
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:27,913
it makes my heart ache.

648
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:37,214
-Gosh, my stomach.
-What's wrong?

649
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:39,049
-My stomach…
-Your stomach, 911…

650
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:40,258
-My stomach…
-Call 911.

651
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,718
Surprise!

652
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:44,512
The Dinosaur Encyclopedia.

653
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:48,266
The Dinosaur Encyclopedia!

654
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,143
The Dinosaur Encyclopedia!

655
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,438
The Dinosaur Encyclopedia.

656
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:55,899
Are you happy?

657
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:58,360
Yes, I'm happy. I'm really happy.

658
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:03,448
Who do you like more, me or Ko Mun-yeong?

659
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:06,534
"Maiasaura means
'good mother reptile' in Latin.

660
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:09,246
It's a herbivorous dinosaur
with a duck-like beak.

661
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:11,748
Dromaeosaurus' name means
'swift running lizard,'

662
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:13,917
and it got its name due to its fast speed.

663
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,586
It's about 35cm big
when it hatches from the egg,

664
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:19,881
and it grows up to three meters
in just a year. Maiasaura…

665
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:23,593
Maiasauras lived in herds
and took care of their infants

666
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:26,096
until they grew up to about one meter.

667
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:29,724
Maisaura means 'good mother reptile.'

668
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:32,435
Bagacera... Bagaceratops.

669
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:36,356
It means 'small-horned face.'
Bagaceratops."

670
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:41,820
What are you doing?

671
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:43,738
Don't wear hats.

672
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:46,908
I can't see your pretty face.

673
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:57,043
It's a reptile.

674
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:01,131
"Bagaceratops is a dinosaur with horns.

675
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:04,718
It has a small body and short tail.

676
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:07,304
Bagaceratops lived in the desert

677
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:10,432
and dug holes in the sand
to lay eggs there.

678
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:12,058
A dinosaur with small horns.

679
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:15,020
A dinosaur with ghastly claws,

680
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:17,230
Baryo... Baryonyx."

681
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:22,569
PARAMEDIC

682
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:25,447
Check his vitals and blood pressure
on your way there.

683
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:28,616
-What about the epinephrine?
-I have some ready just in case.

684
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:31,202
And the medication list
and medical history card?

685
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:32,287
Here.

686
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,414
Thanks. I'll be off now.

687
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:36,666
Let's get going.

688
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:38,793
Good luck.

689
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,927
"It is very nimble and fast.

690
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,596
Dromaeosaurus' name means

691
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,556
-'swift running lizard...'"
-Sang-tae.

692
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:52,474
Sang-tae!

693
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:54,309
"Its body and tail…"

694
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:56,811
You shouldn't get distracted
when you're walking.

695
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:59,981
Remember you got hit by a car
and got hospitalized?

696
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:03,109
-Give it to me.
-No!

697
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:07,947
Give me that. You can read it at home.

698
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:10,116
-Come on.
-No.

699
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,160
-It's dangerous.
-Look!

700
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:17,082
-Sang-tae! Don't run.
-I'll be safe.

701
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:19,209
-It's dangerous.
-Slowly.

702
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,547
-Look.
-You can't fool me again. Give it to me.

703
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,674
Jae-su. It's Jae-su.

704
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:47,529
You know me, right?

705
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:50,907
Even a ton of beer
can't make me get drunk.

706
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:56,287
But it's weird how I get so easily drunk
whenever I drink with a woman.

707
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:58,957
A long time ago,

708
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:00,792
a wise man said,

709
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:04,838
"History is made at night
with alcohol and a woman."

710
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:07,590
But my history

711
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:13,012
is going to be pitch dark.

712
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:15,807
Utterly dark.

713
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:19,936
-Jae-su.
-Yes?

714
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:22,313
You should stop now.

715
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:24,149
Stop what?

716
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:27,318
Suffering from following us around.

717
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,451
Settle down and live comfortably.

718
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:38,997
Why do you care? That's up to me.

719
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,790
Who are you to decide what I do?

720
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:42,750
I'll decide whether to stop or not.

721
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:44,294
What's the matter with you?

722
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:47,672
Did something happen?

723
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:49,674
Why are you so sentimental?

724
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:52,260
That darn woman, Ko Mun-yeong.

725
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:54,888
That crazy woman did something again,
didn't she?

726
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:58,266
-No.
-Don't lie to me.

727
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:01,853
-No, she didn't.
-She obviously did.

728
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:03,938
You never mean it when you say "no."

729
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:04,981
What did she do?

730
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:10,570
I thought I was on the run

731
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:14,449
because of my brother.

732
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:16,743
The butterflies and all.

733
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:20,997
I thought we were being chased
by something that doesn't exist

734
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,918
all because of Sang-tae.

735
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:27,086
Well, it's true.

736
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:30,006
But today, for the first time,

737
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:32,258
I thought

738
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,262
maybe I was just running away

739
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:40,892
because I wanted to.

740
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:44,020
That's not true.

741
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:48,399
You see,

742
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:53,321
when life is unbearably hard,

743
00:58:57,116 --> 00:58:58,618
the easiest way out is to run.

744
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:31,359
THE BOY WHO FED ON NIGHTMARES

745
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:34,445
This is Ms. Ko Mun-yeong's book.

746
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:38,533
Ko Mun-yeong.

747
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:43,162
Sang-tae, do you remember
where we used to live when we were young?

748
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:50,753
-Where we used to live with Mom.
-Seongjin City.

749
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:53,298
Right.

750
00:59:57,927 --> 00:59:58,803
Should we

751
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:02,849
go live there?

752
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:08,271
-If you don't want to--
-Sure.

753
01:00:17,238 --> 01:00:18,239
Are you really okay?

754
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:22,118
The Chinese restaurant there
sells really good  jjamppong.

755
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:25,705
It's at the entrance of the market.
It has mussels and chili pepper in it.

756
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:27,624
-The broth tastes amazing.
-Sang-tae.

757
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:29,667
It's the best.

758
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:34,339
You're really brave.

759
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:36,966
I'm a coward.

760
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,511
You're the younger brother.
That's why you're a coward.

761
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:43,222
Because you're the younger brother.

762
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:46,643
Trust me. I'm the older brother,
you can count on me.

763
01:00:47,226 --> 01:00:49,228
Trust me. You can trust me.

764
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:06,162
-That's such a relief.
-Yes.

765
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:12,210
Who is that?
Is he your boyfriend in Seoul?

766
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:15,213
-What?
-Go ahead and pick up.

767
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:16,631
MOON GANG-TAE

768
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:19,008
Hello?

769
01:01:21,427 --> 01:01:22,303
Hello?

770
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:24,389
Hey.

771
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:29,852
Yes.

772
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:56,713
BORN IN SEONGJIN CITY

773
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,424
"Seongjin City"?

774
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:12,937
No wonder.

775
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:16,941
Your eyes remind me of
someone I used to know.

776
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:26,993
SANGSANGESANG PUBLISHERS

777
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:28,578
We know nothing about it.

778
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:30,496
It was a misunderstanding. All rumors.

779
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,790
We can't reach Ms. Ko either.

780
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:34,542
Yes. Just a second.

781
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:37,712
-Hello?
- This fucking dumbass--

782
01:02:37,795 --> 01:02:39,714
KO MUN-YEONG ABUSES
AND SWEARS AT A FAN

783
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:41,132
My goodness.

784
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:45,344
-Let go of me.
-Listen.

785
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:48,973
This lunatic was harassing our son.
What did you expect?

786
01:02:49,223 --> 01:02:50,141
Crazy bitch.

787
01:02:51,058 --> 01:02:52,769
I thought you were crazy.

788
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:55,563
Didn't you...

789
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:59,400
collect all the CCTV footage
from the bookstore?

790
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:02,862
This video was uploaded this morning
on an online mothers' forum.

791
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:05,907
- Ko Mun-yeong abused and swore at a fan
-My goodness.

792
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:08,367
at her own book signing event

793
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:12,163
and made her fans get extremely shocked
and disappointed at her.

794
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:15,917
She suddenly asked me to apologize
and started yanking my hair.

795
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,418
I already have hair loss.

796
01:03:17,835 --> 01:03:18,795
"Crazy bitch."

797
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:23,216
She called me that and started laughing.
It creeped me out.

798
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:26,844
Ever since then,
I've been getting nightmares.

799
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,263
Everyone, stay focused.

800
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:32,767
I think we should visit them
and compensate them for what happened.

801
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:34,310
That is not all.

802
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:38,648
After the recent incident,
Ko Mun-yeong's bizarre past

803
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:41,108
went viral online.

804
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:43,986
KO MUN-YEONG’S BIZARRE PAST ACTIONS
SHOCK HER FANS

805
01:03:44,445 --> 01:03:45,321
Read it out loud.

806
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:51,410
Don't you know this?

807
01:03:51,744 --> 01:03:52,745
Oh, right.

808
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:55,081
What do you brats think a fairy tale is?

809
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:56,791
The brat on the back. You tell me.

810
01:03:56,874 --> 01:03:58,960
-What did she say?
-Did I hear it wrong?

811
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:01,295
-Don't you know?
-It's okay, everyone.

812
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:04,674
It's how she calls all kids.
Not a big deal.

813
01:04:04,757 --> 01:04:06,884
- Kids are cute. Cute brats.
-What?

814
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:08,678
What's the issue here?

815
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:11,764
-It's used in an affectionate way.
- Are you kidding me?

816
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:13,015
Lovable brats, right?

817
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:15,601
-What's the matter?
- People are raising an issue about

818
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:18,521
the famed fairy tale writer
who has instilled dreams and hopes

819
01:04:18,604 --> 01:04:21,399
to many kids around the world.

820
01:04:21,482 --> 01:04:25,319
Meanwhile, some even say
her name should be removed

821
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:28,990
from the list of candidates
for the Hans Christian Andersen Award--

822
01:04:34,245 --> 01:04:35,371
I... Well...

823
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:37,164
What should we do?

824
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:39,625
I don't think money can solve this one.

825
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:41,961
No, that's not true.

826
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:43,629
It's okay, you guys.

827
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:45,673
We've been through worse.

828
01:04:45,756 --> 01:04:48,801
-There has to be a way out.
-Sir!

829
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:50,970
We're in trouble.

830
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:53,598
Why? What is it this time?

831
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:57,351
A civic group applied for an injunction
against selling the new book,  Zombie Kid,

832
01:04:57,602 --> 01:05:00,187
saying the storyline and illustration
are too cruel.

833
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:05,860
Where is Mun-yeong right now?

834
01:05:06,193 --> 01:05:08,905
Where is Ko Mun-yeong?

835
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:39,602
WELCOME TO OJI-GUN, SEONGJIN CITY

836
01:05:48,152 --> 01:05:49,528
Where is Mun-yeong?

837
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:51,989
She checked out of her hotel room.

838
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:55,743
Oh, okay. Then I should

839
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:58,663
also check out from my life.

840
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:00,706
-Mom!
-Sir!

841
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:01,916
-No!
-Catch him!

842
01:06:01,999 --> 01:06:03,542
Mom!

843
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:05,419
Sir! Stop him!

844
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:07,380
Sir! No, sir!

845
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:08,798
Sir, stop!

846
01:06:08,881 --> 01:06:10,591
Mr. Lee!

847
01:06:13,844 --> 01:06:14,887
I think

848
01:06:16,597 --> 01:06:18,349
it's all because of me.

849
01:06:20,726 --> 01:06:21,560
What?

850
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:23,062
To be honest,

851
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:27,024
I sent this to Ms. Ko this morning.

852
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:37,702
INFORMATION ON MOON GANG-TAE

853
01:06:39,453 --> 01:06:40,663
"Moon Gang-tae"?

854
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:42,832
The caregiver?

855
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:46,419
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

856
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:13,112
There we go.

857
01:08:00,367 --> 01:08:02,286
MR. LEE

858
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:05,122
ANSWER

859
01:08:05,956 --> 01:08:08,459
Mun-yeong, where are you?
Tell me where you are!

860
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:13,005
Do you know  The Red Shoes
written by Hans Christian Andersen?

861
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:15,382
What are you talking about?

862
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:17,134
Where are you right now?

863
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:20,471
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

864
01:08:22,014 --> 01:08:23,390
It's raining.

865
01:08:23,474 --> 01:08:25,267
-It's raining.
-Let's go inside.

866
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:28,229
-It's raining.
-Let's go inside.

867
01:08:28,312 --> 01:08:29,897
Don't run.

868
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:32,024
-Be careful.
-Let's go inside.

869
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:36,612
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

870
01:09:01,011 --> 01:09:05,558
The little girl wore her red shoes
everywhere she went,

871
01:09:06,725 --> 01:09:09,895
even to a God-fearing church.

872
01:09:23,033 --> 01:09:24,618
Once you wear those shoes,

873
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:28,247
your feet start dancing on their own.

874
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:31,709
And you can never stop dancing

875
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:35,129
or take off those shoes.

876
01:09:36,463 --> 01:09:37,339
But even so,

877
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:41,635
the little girl
never gave up on those red shoes.

878
01:09:43,929 --> 01:09:46,765
In the end, the executioner

879
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:48,851
had to cut off her feet.

880
01:09:50,394 --> 01:09:54,106
But the two feet that got cut off

881
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:57,234
still continued to dance
in those red shoes.

882
01:09:58,235 --> 01:09:59,862
Some things can't be torn apart

883
01:09:59,945 --> 01:10:02,198
no matter how hard you try to do so.

884
01:10:10,122 --> 01:10:11,207
Don't tell me...

885
01:10:13,667 --> 01:10:15,461
Yes, the ones in the rooms are fine.

886
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:18,464
But the lights in the lobby
and the reception area are out.

887
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:21,550
Yes, okay.

888
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:31,018
That is why

889
01:10:32,269 --> 01:10:35,481
obsession is noble and beautiful.

890
01:10:59,463 --> 01:11:00,339
I have

891
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:05,261
finally found my red shoes.

892
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:31,370
Why

893
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:34,164
are you here?

894
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:36,292
Why do you think?

895
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:38,836
I came because I missed you.

896
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:39,271
How can you define a relationship

897
01:12:40,272 --> 01:12:43,192
in just one word?

898
01:12:44,234 --> 01:12:46,153
Please teach a class, Ms. Ko.

899
01:12:46,236 --> 01:12:49,156
I'm Ko Mun-yeong.
I'll be teaching this writing class.

900
01:12:49,239 --> 01:12:51,158
I have no time to play with you.

901
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:54,495
Hypocrite. I know you want some fun.

902
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,538
I forget things these days.

903
01:12:56,997 --> 01:12:58,290
Even Sang-tae.

904
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:02,461
-You're not running away.
-You're making

905
01:13:04,588 --> 01:13:06,173
me worried.

906
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:11,053
