1
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:10,403
To get what I couldn't give you last time.

2
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,948
My brother is already a handful.

3
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:58,368
I'm already having a hard time
bearing with him, so please...

4
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,084
Please stop stirring up my miserable life.

5
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,170
And get lost.

6
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:25,728
CHAPTER 11
THE UGLY DUCKLING

7
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,709
What about Ms. Park Ok-ran?
Where is she now?

8
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,545
What do we do? It looks like she escaped.

9
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,213
Call the police station nearby. Hurry.

10
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,048
-Come with me.
-Okay.

11
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:40,386
GANG-TAE

12
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,826
You obviously didn't get all dressed up

13
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,663
and come here at this late hour
just for a cup of tea.

14
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,791
What do you want?

15
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:24,973
Darn it.

16
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,234
How nice.

17
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,906
The smell of old books.

18
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,883
These flowers are dead.

19
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,720
You should toss out dead things.

20
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,394
Don't touch my stuff.

21
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,529
What brings you here?

22
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,074
I was worried

23
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,410
that you'd be lonely.

24
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:41,924
Ko Mun-yeong.

25
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:43,676
Mun-yeong.

26
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:46,971
Earlier today,

27
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,808
your father tried to kill me.

28
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,312
He called me

29
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,689
a monster.

30
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,526
He said all monsters must be killed.

31
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,655
He also said he should've killed
his daughter too that day.

32
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,325
He completely lashed out at me.

33
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,494
You didn't know, did you?

34
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,791
-So what?
-It's just too cruel.

35
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,544
He's a father.
On his daughter's birthday of all days...

36
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,004
Gosh.

37
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,965
How could he say such a thing?

38
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:28,513
So I thought I should come by
to make you feel better

39
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,017
and wish you a happy birthday.

40
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,979
It's lonely to spend a day like this

41
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,315
all by yourself.

42
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,735
-But why do you care?
-Because I'm a fan.

43
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:45,780
Your mother.

44
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:47,907
I'm a fan of hers.

45
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:50,910
This is pretty.

46
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,626
I clearly told you

47
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,712
not to touch my stuff.

48
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,721
We're alike.

49
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,348
I also

50
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:15,643
hate it when people touch my stuff.

51
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,968
Ko Mun-yeong!

52
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,721
Ko Mun-yeong!

53
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,934
Where...

54
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:10,615
Ko Mun-yeong.

55
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:15,620
Moon Gang-tae?

56
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:37,850
Thank goodness.

57
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,520
I'm so glad you're okay.

58
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,149
Thank goodness.

59
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,032
Are you all right?

60
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,493
Are you hurt?

61
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,501
-That lady, Park Ok-ran--
-Where is she?

62
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,546
Where is she now?

63
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,466
-She left.
-When? Where did she go?

64
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,261
When did she leave?

65
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:15,846
Just now.

66
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,104
Did you

67
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,566
come here to catch that escaped patient?

68
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,235
Not because of me?

69
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,989
Not because you missed me?

70
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:44,041
So you obviously
put your brother before me,

71
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:49,839
and even that patient
is more important to you than I am.

72
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,512
Ko Mun-yeong.

73
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,824
He followed that patient here,

74
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,784
so why the hell did he hug me?

75
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,550
Please.

76
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,762
At least count to three
before you do anything impulsive.

77
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:46,562
-One.
-Oh, no.

78
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,898
Is your hand okay?

79
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:50,983
-Two.
-You're bleeding.

80
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:52,902
-My gosh.
-Three.

81
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:57,990
I'm returning it.

82
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:03,829
Get out.

83
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:10,252
Should I have just stabbed her with it
and kept her here?

84
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,106
Let's talk.

85
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,394
Why wrap that around my hand?
Did I say it hurt?

86
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:16,068
It's just a small cut on the palm.
It doesn't even hurt.

87
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,778
"What we have
is an ill-fated relationship.

88
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,781
Please stop stirring up my miserable life.
And get lost."

89
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,742
That nonsense you talked about
was much more...

90
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,662
It was

91
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,124
much more hurtful.

92
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:34,962
You said that I'm not an empty can.

93
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,840
Then why are you treating me like one?

94
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,758
I said today
is a very important day to me.

95
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,469
I told you that I didn't want to be alone!

96
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,351
When you can't control yourself,

97
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,645
count to three.

98
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,069
One.

99
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:10,539
Two.

100
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,008
-Three.
-Three.

101
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:54,935
Happy birthday.

102
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:01,734
I missed you.

103
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:10,993
Why are you blushing?

104
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,705
I'm... I'm just hot.

105
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,499
It's so hot in here, isn't it?

106
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,756
Your face is all red too.

107
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:31,388
I'm not feeling well.

108
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,933
You're burning up.

109
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,852
Mr. Moon called.

110
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:41,190
It sounds like Ms. Park Ok-ran
stopped by Ms. Ko's place.

111
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,816
What? Why did she go there?

112
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,443
We'll have to find out.

113
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,947
Let the police know
where she was last seen.

114
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,367
Yes, sir. I'll also update you
as soon as we check the security footage.

115
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,119
She may come back late at night,

116
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,287
so stay here

117
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,623
and make rounds throughout the night.

118
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:58,666
-Yes, sir.
-Will do.

119
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:01,460
Is your head okay?

120
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,671
How could I be okay?
She hit my head with a stone.

121
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,339
This should be processed
as a workplace injury.

122
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:06,382
All right.

123
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,384
I'll help you file a claim
for the benefits

124
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,386
and also consider
terminating your employment.

125
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,846
-Wait.
-Get home safely, sir.

126
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:13,764
Get home safely.

127
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,642
Hot. It's hot.

128
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,227
Be careful when touching something hot.

129
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:21,522
Gosh, it's hot. Be careful.
You must be careful.

130
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,736
Hey, Sang-tae.

131
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,655
Hi, Jae-su.

132
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,409
What? Why are you eating so late?

133
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,077
Are you snacking?

134
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,496
I waited for Gang-tae
to have dinner with him,

135
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,790
but there's an emergency at the hospital.

136
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,501
He has to catch someone,
so he can't come home tonight.

137
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,461
He's been dispatched.

138
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:48,382
That's why I'm here on his behalf.

139
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:50,718
That looks good.

140
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:55,389
-Can I have a bite?
-Gosh, no way. This is mine.

141
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,392
One bite will turn
into two and three bites.

142
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,394
"He who will steal an egg
will steal an ox."

143
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,895
No way. This is all mine.

144
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,023
Oh, right.

145
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,735
I found this out front.

146
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:09,570
That's Mang-tae.

147
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,530
-Mang-tae?
-Yes.

148
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,532
You mean, as in Grandpa Mang-tae
from the book?

149
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,493
No, he's not a grandpa.
He's Gang-tae's little brother.

150
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,121
Sang-tae, Gang-tae, and Mang-tae.

151
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,039
We're

152
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,750
three brothers.

153
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,334
Goodness.

154
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,253
What the heck?

155
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:29,631
I can't believe you're calling
this ugly fabric doll your little brother.

156
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,718
I'm the one who's been
following you around for over ten years.

157
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,346
If you want to say you have two brothers,

158
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:37,973
include me.

159
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,602
Jae-su between Sang-tae and Gang-tae.

160
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,855
-Include Jae-su.
-No way, Jae-su.

161
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,274
You're not our brother.

162
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,277
We don't have the same surname
and we're not related.

163
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,821
You're not on our family register,
so we're basically strangers.

164
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,449
You're not our family. How dare you.

165
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,035
How dare you...

166
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,662
-Just include me!
-Gosh, no. Don't.

167
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,790
Don't do that when I'm eating hot food.

168
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,666
-Just include me, will you?
-No, Jae-su--

169
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,877
-No, Mang-tae! It's hot!
-Gosh!

170
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,808
Come. I filled the bathtub
with ice-cold water.

171
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,022
Ice-cold water? Why?

172
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,649
You need to bring your fever down.

173
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:31,360
I've seen it in movies.
Get undressed and go in the tub.

174
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,239
You want rose petals in the water?

175
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,700
No, it's okay. Just get me a wet towel.

176
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,587
That lady...

177
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,674
Did she escape the hospital?

178
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:56,885
Can I ask you

179
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,222
what she said to you?

180
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:05,477
She said she thought I'd be lonely
and came to wish me a happy birthday.

181
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,021
She also said she's my mom's fan.

182
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,357
What else?

183
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,487
She said she nearly died
at the hospital today.

184
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,373
Why did that happen?

185
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,128
Patients often get into a fight like that.

186
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,338
You don't need to worry about it.

187
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,806
This feels nice.

188
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:46,894
What feels nice?

189
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,645
I've never

190
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,026
had someone look after me

191
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:56,528
when I was sick.

192
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,450
Ju-ri!

193
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,122
Heading out to work?

194
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:32,874
I'm sorry.

195
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,211
I should've apologized to you sooner
for the trouble I caused you.

196
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,339
Gosh, we're no strangers.

197
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,216
We're like a family
living under the same roof.

198
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,718
Come on. Don't even worry about it.

199
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:44,928
Here.

200
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,599
-What is this?
-Money for a car wash.

201
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,063
Please accept it.

202
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,528
-So this is how it feels.
-Pardon?

203
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:04,448
Every time Mun-yeong
got herself in trouble in the past,

204
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:08,493
I gave people cash
disguised as a box of sweet drinks.

205
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,164
This is probably how they felt
upon receiving it.

206
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,418
You reap what you sow.

207
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,927
Let's go out for a meal with this money.

208
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,555
Then I'll call it even.

209
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,329
Damn it.

210
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,508
I thought you were gone.

211
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:06,843
Where would I go?

212
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:08,637
How's your fever?

213
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,433
-It's gone down.
-In just a day?

214
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,020
You little...
You were faking it, weren't you?

215
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,107
No.

216
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,734
It was lovesickness.

217
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:30,450
Let's talk.

218
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:41,670
What did you want to talk to me about?

219
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:48,844
It's about my brother.

220
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,597
Jeez, that brother of yours.

221
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,225
Sang-tae

222
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:57,936
has a traumatic memory.

223
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:02,899
A traumatic memory?

224
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:07,070
That's why we left Seongjin City
when we were little

225
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:10,532
and had to move as if we're running away
from something every spring.

226
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:12,993
All because of his traumatic memory.

227
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,001
My mom

228
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:27,924
was murdered.

229
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:31,970
And Sang-tae was the only witness

230
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:35,724
who saw her getting murdered.

231
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:53,867
The butterfly said it'd kill me as well

232
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:56,328
if I didn't keep my lips sealed.

233
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,955
It said it'd chase me down

234
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:02,918
and kill me!

235
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:04,961
We were scared, so we ran away.

236
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,672
I was only 12,

237
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,300
- and there was no adult
-Come on.

238
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,052
who could protect us.

239
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,014
That's when it began.

240
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:19,935
Every spring
when you start seeing butterflies,

241
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:21,519
Sang-tae

242
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,816
has nightmares about the night
when Mom was killed.

243
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,364
What? Butterflies...

244
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,658
No, those butterflies!

245
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,960
-What? What's going on?
-Butterflies!

246
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,211
-Goodness.
-Butterflies!

247
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:47,921
-What's the matter?
-Those butterflies...

248
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:49,839
-Sang-tae.
-Butterflies...

249
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,549
Gosh, those butterflies...

250
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:54,177
-Butterflies! Those butterflies!
-He says the butterflies will kill him.

251
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:57,180
They said they'll kill me. The butterflies

252
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,099
-will kill me!
- And that we must run far away.

253
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:00,725
They're coming to kill me!

254
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,936
He's been bearing that pain all on his own

255
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:06,273
for nearly 20 years now.

256
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,444
And that's why

257
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,531
he needs me.

258
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:20,036
But the thing is,

259
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,082
despite that,

260
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,587
I keep wanting to spend time with you.

261
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,382
You once said

262
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,467
that you don't care about destiny.

263
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,138
If someone shows up when you need them,

264
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,265
you call that destiny.

265
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,352
And I

266
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:46,646
need you.

267
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:57,532
I have to stay

268
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,410
by Sang-tae's side,

269
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,291
so you just

270
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,377
stay by my side.

271
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:19,971
Sure, why not?

272
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,153
SANG-TAE

273
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:39,616
It is a flower

274
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,284
It is a flower

275
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:46,247
-Hey.
- Did you eat?

276
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,042
I had rice
with kimchi soybean sprout soup.

277
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,378
Did you catch the culprit? The culprit.

278
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,756
She's a patient, not a culprit.

279
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:56,800
Yes, the patient. Did you catch her?

280
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,135
No, I couldn't find her.

281
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:02,097
Oh, no. Then what are you going to do?

282
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,058
You don't need to worry about that.

283
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,895
Don't eat dinner without me.
I'll try to be home early.

284
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:10,980
Okay.

285
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:14,818
He'll be home early today.

286
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,840
The test will be done in no time,

287
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:40,176
so don't worry about a thing.
I'll see you in a bit.

288
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,512
Get going.

289
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:44,931
See you later.

290
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,354
Oh, boy.

291
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,151
I hope his brain tumor hasn't come back.

292
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,277
I'm worried.

293
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,447
It's a miracle that he's managed to
survive in that state for almost 20 years.

294
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,868
What did the police say
about Ms. Park Ok-ran?

295
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,620
She was last caught on CCTV footage

296
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:10,206
by the exit of a hiking trail
in Mount Oji last night.

297
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,542
They have to investigate
to find out where she went.

298
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:16,171
Really? Then clean up her bed

299
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,173
and send her belongings to the police.

300
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,508
We have to admit a patient
on the waiting list.

301
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,595
Already? She may come back.

302
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:26,973
No, she won't be able to.

303
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,195
Hi.

304
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:48,995
Wait.

305
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,249
We have to clean up Park Ok-ran's bed
and collect her belongings.

306
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:55,084
-Already?
-Yes.

307
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:58,129
Ms. Park said we have to admit a patient
on the waiting list.

308
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,384
THE MURDER OF THE WITCH OF THE WEST

309
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,553
Is she not coming back?

310
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,015
Or can she not come back?

311
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,270
Even when dogs run away,

312
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:17,899
people at least pretend to look for them
for a few days.

313
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:22,403
The head nurse doesn't come across
like that, but she's heartless.

314
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,489
The police are looking for her.

315
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,199
I see.

316
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,208
NAME: PARK OK-RAN

317
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,126
Thank you.

318
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:40,421
You've changed.

319
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,466
-Pardon?
-Your smile.

320
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,260
It's pretty.

321
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:55,478
I heard Park Ok-ran
was an obscure stage actress in the past.

322
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,856
She had multiple plastic surgeries.

323
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:02,235
I heard it from Yoo Seon-hae,
who shares the room with her.

324
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:05,280
-Gosh, what is this?
-She said that woman had been

325
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,323
acting weird for a couple of months.

326
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,826
Apparently, she said
she had to practice acting

327
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:12,370
and kept snickering
while looking in the mirror.

328
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:15,999
She also kept memorizing something
all night.

329
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:19,377
Yoo Seon-hae said she seemed to think
that she was still an actress.

330
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,213
She was practicing acting?

331
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:47,906
THE MURDER OF THE WITCH OF THE WEST

332
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,192
I'm so glad I held myself back last night.

333
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:16,911
Damn it!

334
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:18,663
What? "Damn it"?

335
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:23,126
I see that you're beginning
to show your true colors.

336
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,086
I'm sorry, sir.

337
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:28,798
-Where did you sleep last night?
-Pardon me?

338
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:33,386
You looked depressed,
but you now look all happy.

339
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:35,388
I guess you slept somewhere else
last night.

340
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:39,726
Did you get some action
instead of looking for the patient?

341
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:42,729
No, sir. That's not what happened.

342
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:48,651
But why go there?

343
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,197
Well...

344
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:56,826
I was very worried and...

345
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:59,162
To wish her a happy birthday, perhaps?

346
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:03,958
No.

347
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:07,712
That's not why I went there. I just--

348
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:11,090
No, I'm talking about Ms. Park Ok-ran.

349
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,925
Why did she go there?

350
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:17,055
There's no way she escaped

351
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,265
just to wish Ms. Ko a happy birthday.

352
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,023
I hope that's the case though.

353
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:30,109
I hope Ms. Park went there
to wish her a happy birthday

354
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,363
and that

355
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,784
nothing will happen to us anymore.

356
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:43,581
I really hope so.

357
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:51,798
And that being said...

358
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:58,971
Sir.

359
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,618
Everything from here to here.
To go, please.

360
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:22,995
Everything?

361
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,836
Everything on that row, ma'am?

362
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:31,879
While you're getting that ready,

363
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,384
I'd like to speak with your part-timer.

364
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,970
Sang-tae.

365
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:41,764
I think Ms. Ko needs to talk to you
about something.

366
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,349
Hurry over here and have a seat.

367
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,525
Move back in.

368
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,819
We need to get some work done.

369
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,829
This drawing you gave me--

370
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,539
I didn't give it to you. I threw it out.

371
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,501
Right, this drawing you had tossed out

372
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,795
gave me an idea for my next book.

373
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:13,713
Amazing, right?

374
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,677
I'll tell you what I want to write about.

375
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,513
These three will set off on a long journey

376
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,974
to find something they lost.

377
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:26,517
Oh, that will be fun.

378
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,602
Right?

379
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:29,979
Best friends do think alike.

380
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,566
That looks fun. I want it.

381
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:01,719
He said he'd never draw butterflies.
He was stubborn about it,

382
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:05,056
so I sort of had a hunch,

383
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:09,560
but I didn't know
there was such a shocking story behind it.

384
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,981
But why are you telling me all this
out of the blue?

385
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:17,193
You said one must

386
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:21,113
face one's traumatic memories
to overcome them.

387
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,202
Please help Sang-tae

388
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,040
so that he can face his trauma.

389
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,001
Do you trust me?

390
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,754
Everyone in this field

391
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,966
says that I'm a quack,
not just a quirky weirdo.

392
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:44,011
If you're a quack,

393
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:46,389
my brother

394
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:50,434
will know right away.

395
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,943
Unilaterally terminating the contract
triples the penalty.

396
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,111
You know that, right?

397
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:02,780
The penalty?
That was not included in the contract.

398
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,156
What you see isn't everything.

399
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:08,869
When it comes to liability
for breach of contract,

400
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:12,415
a verbal agreement based on trust
is enough. It's a tacit rule.

401
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,045
-Your face tells me that you do.
-What?

402
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:21,299
No, I never received anything.

403
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:22,758
Not even the camping car.

404
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:25,136
I provided you with room and board.

405
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,554
Do you know how much that cost me?

406
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:30,850
Either compensate me threefold
or draw my illustrations.

407
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:33,269
-Your choice.
-My choice?

408
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:38,024
I need to double that, for Gang-tae.

409
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,358
Compensate me sixfold.

410
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:42,236
What? Sixfold?

411
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:55,750
Hey.

412
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,085
Ms. Ko Mun-yeong
is such a wonderful person.

413
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,673
What's gotten into you?

414
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:06,761
You know that I love people
who are generous and decisive.

415
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:08,804
You do?

416
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,015
Yes, she's totally my type.

417
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:13,476
Not romantically though.
I'm not saying I'm attracted to her.

418
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,561
You're my number one,
no matter what anyone says.

419
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,983
But how important am I to you?

420
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:22,568
You're my number three.

421
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:29,075
What on earth is she up to?

422
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:31,327
- Even if it blooms in the field
-You won't draw my illustrations

423
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,536
- It is a flower
-or pay the penalty.

424
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,121
-So what? You don't care?
-Hello, tree!

425
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,332
-Good morning!
-Forget the contract.

426
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:38,417
- It is a flower
-We're besties. You're my fan.

427
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,127
- It is a flower
-A fan must stay loyal.

428
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:43,339
- It is a flower
-Sang-tae, a promise

429
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:46,300
isn't something you can take so lightly.
Do you hear me?

430
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,514
Damn it. Moon Sang-tae!

431
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:53,140
You can't have Gang-tae!

432
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,186
Never!

433
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:00,940
Gang-tae isn't some object
we can toss around.

434
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:03,025
That's right. He's my brother.

435
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,443
Exactly, he's just your brother.

436
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,904
-He's not yours.
-He's not yours either.

437
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:08,072
Gang-tae is mine.

438
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:09,615
Gang-tae belongs to Gang-tae.

439
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:11,534
No, he's mine. I'm his big brother.

440
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:13,160
I'm sick of that word, "brother"!

441
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,454
You're just a stranger to us. A stranger!

442
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,081
-"Brother"!
-Stranger!

443
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,874
-I'm so sick of that word.
-Stranger.

444
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:19,917
-Damn it.
-Gosh.

445
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,293
-They're fighting.
-Stop swearing.

446
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,087
-Old habits...
-Teacher, they're fighting!

447
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,588
-die hard.
-No, they're not fighting.

448
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,382
-Let's go.
-Hi. Hello!

449
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,092
Did you and that lady fight?

450
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:30,428
Yes. No, we didn't really fight.

451
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:32,221
Why did you two fight?

452
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:35,266
We didn't fight.
We just had disagreements.

453
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,311
I really did my best.

454
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,523
How?

455
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,234
I tried asking him nicely and
persuading him in an articulate manner.

456
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:47,653
More like threatening him, I'm sure.

457
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,991
-Did you guys talk on the phone?
-Must I ask him to know?

458
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,660
Then you probably also know
how I feel right now.

459
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:56,078
How do you feel?

460
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:58,456
"Please give me permission
to marry your daughter."

461
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:01,333
I can totally relate to men
who must beg their girlfriends' parents.

462
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:03,544
-Really?
-Yes, really.

463
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:07,840
But you know...

464
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:11,844
Without his permission,

465
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,222
we can't live together.

466
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,934
It took my friend, Jae-su,

467
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,687
about ten years
to become close to Sang-tae.

468
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:22,855
Ten years?

469
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:26,901
-Anyway, just wait.
-For ten years? Are you nuts?

470
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,612
No. I have to drop these off
at the nurses' station, so wait here.

471
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:32,448
That little...

472
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,458
Did it really take him ten years?

473
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:44,126
No, right? You were joking, right?

474
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:46,670
-Ten years, my foot.
-Right?

475
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,882
You already got on his bad side,
so it'll take longer.

476
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,762
I definitely cannot wait that long.
No way. I refuse!

477
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:06,398
For Sang-tae...

478
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:08,400
I'm his only family.

479
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:12,947
He's afraid
that you'd take me away from him

480
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,032
and that he'd be left alone.

481
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:18,327
-What do I do, then?
-We should earn his trust.

482
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,997
-What do you mean?
-You're not taking me away from him.

483
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,959
He now has one more person
who will stay by his side.

484
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:28,504
You're not a stranger.
You'll be one of us.

485
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:30,923
Earn his trust.

486
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,553
You will, right?

487
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:39,390
I'll try.

488
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:43,727
Also,

489
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,188
keep the door locked when you're alone.

490
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:49,066
Do not let strangers into the house.

491
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:50,609
Okay?

492
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:53,862
Okay, I won't.

493
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,242
Good girl.

494
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,796
My gosh, what's all this pizza for?

495
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:19,054
So? How's Mr. Ko doing?

496
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:22,891
The brain tumor has spread deep inside
the frontal lobe.

497
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,811
What did his doctor say?
Can he undergo surgery now?

498
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,856
No, he said it'll be pointless now.

499
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:32,568
My gosh, I feel so bad for Mr. Ko.

500
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:34,486
Oh, dear.

501
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:57,343
Where are you going?

502
00:43:57,926 --> 00:43:59,595
I have plans. I'm leaving for the day.

503
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:02,681
Plans? With who?
You're taking the rest of the day off?

504
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:05,309
With Sang-in. I'll see you later.

505
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:06,727
Wait, just a second.

506
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:12,524
What? Gosh, no. I don't want that.

507
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,861
-Stay still, will you?
-No.

508
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:17,363
You're going on a date,

509
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:19,948
so you need
to put on some makeup at least.

510
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:22,201
You'll meet him barefaced?
Are you that confident?

511
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:23,452
Goodness.

512
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:29,541
-How do I look?
-You look so pretty.

513
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:33,128
It looks like spring flowers
have bloomed on your lips.

514
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:35,422
I'll see you at home.

515
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:38,509
Stay out as late as possible.

516
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:56,026
My gosh, you're wearing makeup.

517
00:44:58,612 --> 00:44:59,571
I wear makeup every day.

518
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:04,493
Right. You look pretty every single day

519
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:06,912
with or without makeup.

520
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,667
Well, can I ask you something
about Mun-yeong?

521
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:15,587
Does she have any family members
other than her dad?

522
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:17,089
Any close relatives?

523
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,760
Had there been an adult
who could look after her,

524
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,680
she would've ended up quite differently.

525
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:27,182
Why do you ask?

526
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:30,811
Are Professor Ko's test results that bad?

527
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:33,856
Has his brain tumor come back?

528
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:38,318
It doesn't look like
he can undergo surgery again.

529
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:43,574
That's unfortunate.

530
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:47,411
I'll see how she's doing
and find the best time to tell her.

531
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:55,043
By any chance, did Gang-tae--

532
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:57,796
-Well, Ju-ri.
-Yes?

533
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,716
Enough about Moon Gang-tae
and Ko Mun-yeong.

534
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:04,219
Why don't we talk about Nam Ju-ri
and Lee Sang-in?

535
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,891
Let them have fun on their own.

536
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:11,894
There are so many things
I want to know about Nam Ju-ri.

537
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:17,274
Since when did pink lipstick
suit you so well?

538
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:20,402
And why do you turn into
a different person when you're drunk?

539
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:21,612
Oh, also...

540
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:26,950
Who taught you to swear like that?

541
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:31,205
I...

542
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:35,042
Back in middle school,

543
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:36,084
I see.

544
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:39,546
My dad taught me how to drink.

545
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,423
Then how much can you drink?

546
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:53,852
I must pay threefold.

547
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:56,522
No, I must pay six times the amount
to get Gang-tae out as well.

548
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,441
But all I have is...

549
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,028
-Sang-tae.
-Yes.

550
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:05,822
-It's hot. What are you doing in there?
-Yes.

551
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:09,660
Well...

552
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:26,218
-Did everything go well at the restaurant?
-Yes.

553
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:28,762
Oh, Jae-su gave me a tip
because we made a lot of money today.

554
00:47:28,845 --> 00:47:29,721
He gave me 30,000 won.

555
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:32,724
Customers give you tips,

556
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,226
bosses give you bonuses.

557
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:36,228
Yes, I got 30,000 won as a bonus.

558
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:37,771
I see.

559
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:40,274
Someone must've bought a lot of pizza.

560
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:41,567
Yes...

561
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:44,611
Yes. Ms. Ko Mun-yeong. She's rich.

562
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,488
She's filthy rich.

563
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:50,534
Ms. Ko came to the pizzeria? Why?

564
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:52,578
She... She came to the pizzeria
to buy pizza.

565
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:54,496
She didn't come to the pizzeria
to buy potatoes.

566
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,665
Why would you ask something so obvious?

567
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:02,379
Why are you here?

568
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:07,175
He was worried about
leaving you here all by yourself,

569
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:09,595
so I was asked to stay here for a while.

570
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:10,762
Mr. Lee?

571
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,764
No, it was Mr. Moon Gang-tae.

572
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:17,769
Don't just stand there.

573
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,354
Come here and sit down.

574
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:30,198
Mr. Moon called and asked Mr. Lee

575
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:32,951
if it'd be okay for me to work here.

576
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:35,912
He said that?

577
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:38,457
Mr. Lee was also thrilled
that you're going to start

578
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,500
working on your next book.

579
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:44,546
So he wanted me to come here
and support you for the time being.

580
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:45,881
Is that so?

581
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,968
Feel free to let me know
if you need anything.

582
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,054
I don't really need anything.

583
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:54,389
But I do have a question.

584
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:56,475
Sure. Go ahead.

585
00:48:57,476 --> 00:49:00,604
Someone visited me last night

586
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:03,315
saying she's a fan of my mother.

587
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,109
And it just so happened to be

588
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:08,654
my birthday.

589
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:11,823
Isn't that weird?

590
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:13,492
No, not at all.

591
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:14,993
Why?

592
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:18,789
Back when I used to be a fan of Tony,
an H.O.T member,

593
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:22,000
I congratulated all the birthdays
of his entire family.

594
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:25,003
I bought gifts and waited for him
in front of his accommodation,

595
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:27,339
and the managers got really angry at me.

596
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,300
And after the group disbanded,

597
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:33,011
I went around everywhere
to get a glimpse of them again.

598
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:37,766
Really?

599
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:40,936
But if you were an H.O.T fan,

600
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:42,562
how old are you?

601
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:47,776
Have a good night.

602
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:53,073
Are you sure you're younger than me?

603
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:55,992
-"I... I ate breakfast.
- I ate breakfast.

604
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,286
-Then I ate lunch.
- Then I ate lunch.

605
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,706
- And I had a small dinner.
-And I had a small dinner.

606
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:02,290
- So I was hungry at night.
-So I was hungry at night.

607
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:04,209
- Why isn't there anything about me?
-Why isn't there anything about me?"

608
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:05,794
- What do you mean?
-Sang-tae.

609
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,631
Why does Gil-dong let them live with him
even though he's always

610
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:10,757
angry at them?

611
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:14,761
That's because he's their guardian.
He's an adult.

612
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:18,014
But they're not even his family.

613
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:21,143
That's right. They don't have the same
surname, aren't related to each other,

614
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:24,229
and they're not on the same family
register. So they're basically strangers.

615
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:28,233
If they're strangers,

616
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,485
why does he let them live with him?

617
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:33,447
Because he's their guardian.
He's an adult.

618
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:38,660
You're

619
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:41,371
an adult, right?

620
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:50,088
Moon Sang-tae, 35 years old.

621
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:52,424
Born in 1984, the year of the rat.
I'm younger than I look,

622
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:54,468
but I'm not a child.

623
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:58,805
Exactly. You're an adult.

624
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:03,393
An adult like Ko Gil-dong,
who can accept others as a family.

625
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:07,439
Yes.

626
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:16,364
Sang-tae, do you want to know something?

627
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:19,534
I'm also

628
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:22,245
trying really hard

629
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:26,249
to become an adult.

630
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:29,461
You... You can also become an adult.

631
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:31,505
You... You just need to try hard.

632
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:33,215
You just need to make an effort.

633
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:50,982
I'm guessing you'll be done by next week.

634
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:54,736
Yes, I'm... I'm almost done.

635
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,321
It'll be complete soon. I'll be done.

636
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:00,659
But...

637
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:04,996
By the way,
how much are you going to pay me?

638
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:08,375
How... How much do you think
you can pay me for this?

639
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:11,419
I want to get paid the day I finish this.

640
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:15,215
Oh, dear. I don't see any butterflies
in the flower garden.

641
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:23,682
I... I'm not going to draw
any butterflies.

642
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:26,101
I told you that I wanted the painting

643
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:29,271
to look exactly like the garden outside.

644
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:32,941
There are tons of butterflies outside,
but the mural has none.

645
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:35,402
That means it's not complete.

646
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:36,486
It means you're not done.

647
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:39,030
I... I don't like butterflies.

648
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:41,032
I... I don't want to draw butterflies.

649
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:43,618
Then forget it.
But you won't be getting paid.

650
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:45,120
I don't want an incomplete mural.

651
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:48,290
But... But my money...

652
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:49,875
But...

653
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:56,047
This... This is pretty much complete.

654
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:57,799
My money... Gosh.

655
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:00,927
Oh, no.

656
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:06,349
O Ji-wang is a con artist.
He's a liar. That's what he is.

657
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:09,644
He sounds nice and looks nice,

658
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:11,438
but he's a liar.

659
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:13,565
I... I can't trust anyone.

660
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:19,654
Did I keep you waiting?

661
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:21,323
Let's go.

662
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,453
Why did you bring all your paints?

663
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:27,954
You're not done with the mural.

664
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:29,497
I'm not going to do it.

665
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,084
Why not?

666
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:36,254
I... I just don't want to.

667
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,132
Why don't you want to?

668
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:40,342
You're almost done.

669
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:42,636
No, I don't want to. Forget it.

670
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:45,388
I... I don't want to draw butterflies.
I don't want to do that.

671
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:47,557
Sang-tae.

672
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:49,142
Can we talk?

673
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:50,602
Stop.

674
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:53,229
Sang-tae.

675
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:54,606
Gosh.

676
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:56,232
Goodness.

677
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,361
Get up.

678
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:05,200
Get up. Let's talk.

679
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:07,035
Let me go!

680
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:11,122
You're not going to draw the mural
or go to the hospital?

681
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:13,208
And why don't you ever want to see
Director O again?

682
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:22,133
Are you going to avoid answering me
and keep acting like a kid?

683
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:23,635
I thought you were an adult.

684
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:25,971
Come on. Get up.

685
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:28,640
I'm going to count to three.

686
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:29,683
One.

687
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:32,686
Two.

688
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:34,980
-Three.
-Director O is a con artist!

689
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:38,149
He's a liar! He... He's even worse
than people who do voice phishing.

690
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:41,069
He... He promised to pay me once I'm done.

691
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:42,904
So why... Why won't he pay me?

692
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:45,156
Gosh. Stop running away. I won't let you.

693
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,324
-No.
-Talk to me.

694
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:47,492
No, let me go.

695
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:48,576
Just talk to me, Sang-tae.

696
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,786
No, I'm going to go. Move.

697
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:51,496
Stop avoiding it
and tell me what happened.

698
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:52,497
Let me go!

699
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:53,999
Will you please just talk?

700
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:01,172
It hurts, right?

701
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,882
It hurts when someone hits you,
doesn't it?

702
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:04,968
You hurt me, too. Look at the bite mark.

703
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:06,886
You... You hit me?

704
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,222
You hit your big brother?

705
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:11,349
How dare you hit your big brother?

706
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:12,726
You hurt me, too.

707
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:14,269
It hurt like crazy

708
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:16,187
when you stabbed me on the head
with a pencil.

709
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:19,607
When you pushed me and made me hit
a desk, I couldn't even sleep at night.

710
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:23,028
Do you think I stay quiet
because I enjoy getting hurt?

711
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:25,905
I'm not going to hold it in anymore.
I'm done doing that!

712
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,867
When... When you need to control yourself,
count to three.

713
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:30,201
One, two, three.

714
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:31,327
No, you count!

715
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:32,412
Listen to your big brother!

716
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:33,830
Then act like one!

717
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:46,885
Wait... Sang-tae, I meant...

718
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:48,762
You... You yelled at me?

719
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:52,932
How... How dare you yell
at your big brother?

720
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:55,226
You... You dared to yell at me?

721
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:58,104
How dare you? How... How could you?

722
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:03,151
How could you do that to me?

723
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:04,486
How could you?

724
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,701
Stop!

725
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,001
Come over here!

726
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,420
Come here!

727
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:32,514
Hey!

728
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:44,859
Are you about to die soon or something?

729
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:46,361
Is that why you're acting out?

730
00:56:49,405 --> 00:56:51,491
I didn't really mind it
when Sang-tae hit me.

731
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:55,286
But now that I've fought back...

732
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:58,123
What did I tell you?
It breaks your heart, doesn't it?

733
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:00,792
No.

734
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:05,839
I feel so relieved.

735
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:15,723
The lunatic virus
is surprisingly powerful.

736
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:17,684
You've changed so much.

737
00:57:18,434 --> 00:57:19,686
Jae-su.

738
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,521
Who are you? Do I know you?

739
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:25,024
This is...

740
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:31,197
who I really am.

741
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,164
Moon Gang-tae

742
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:41,583
belongs to Moon Gang-tae.

743
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:50,675
It's going to sting.

744
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:54,387
Gang-tae isn't my brother anymore.

745
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,055
He's not my brother.

746
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,307
Yes, you're right.

747
00:57:57,390 --> 00:58:00,268
He shouldn't have scratched you.
That's cheating.

748
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:02,562
I never took him as the type
to fight dirty like this.

749
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:03,688
He cheated.

750
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:06,733
I saw him earlier,
and he was a lot more injured.

751
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:12,614
He's not my little brother anymore.
We're strangers now.

752
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:14,449
We're strangers.

753
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:17,535
-You're strangers?
-Yes.

754
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:20,038
Then...

755
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:24,375
Mom, why don't you just adopt Gang-tae
as your son?

756
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:27,253
I'd love to do that.

757
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,088
Sang-tae, thank you.

758
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,924
I'll think of him as my son now.

759
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:33,176
No.

760
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:35,887
Never mind. We're strangers.

761
00:58:58,159 --> 00:58:59,035
Are you sleeping?

762
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:25,353
Jae-su.

763
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,523
I know you are disappointed,
but try to understand.

764
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:31,943
Me and Sang-tae...

765
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:36,906
It's just been the two of us
for a long time.

766
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,452
We have to learn

767
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:46,457
to socialize with other people.

768
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:49,002
But why does it have to be

769
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,130
Ko Mun-yeong?

770
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:55,383
She's the loneliest person

771
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:57,802
I know.

772
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:01,848
I'm going to start with her.

773
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:24,037
Call me.

774
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:25,788
I'm bored.

775
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:26,956
I'm hungry.

776
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:31,711
Darn it.

777
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:34,422
Why does he read my messages
if he isn't going to reply?

778
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:53,149
Maybe I shouldn't have returned Mang-tae.

779
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:04,595
I told you not to open the door
for strangers.

780
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:07,140
You promised.

781
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:08,933
Why did you bring this?

782
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:10,143
What are you doing here?

783
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:13,730
You told me you're hungry.

784
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:15,815
Let's go outside.

785
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,239
Are you really not going to tell me?

786
01:02:23,656 --> 01:02:25,199
What happened to your face?

787
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:29,454
I got into a fight.

788
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:30,997
With a patient?

789
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:34,834
-That will get me fired.
-Then who was it?

790
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:37,545
-What are you going to do?
-I'm going to beat them up.

791
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:42,967
My brother.

792
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:44,927
Sang-tae?

793
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:46,637
You beat him up?

794
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,307
No, we just had a fight.

795
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:51,309
He hit me a lot more than I did.

796
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:57,482
Didn't you say we need to let him know
that he'll be getting another friend?

797
01:02:57,565 --> 01:02:58,816
But you just fought with him?

798
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:02,904
What are you going to do now?

799
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:07,116
I'm still thinking about it.

800
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,161
Weren't you the one who told me
to think before I act?

801
01:03:10,244 --> 01:03:12,580
You told me it's not a bad thing
to stick to your instincts.

802
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:18,753
Just be honest with him.

803
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:22,298
-What do you mean?
-Tell him you like me

804
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:23,800
and that you can't live without me.

805
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:25,176
Ask for his understanding.

806
01:03:25,259 --> 01:03:26,427
It's simple.

807
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:30,681
I...

808
01:03:33,851 --> 01:03:35,269
like Ko Mun-yeong.

809
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:43,694
I wonder what he'll say

810
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:47,782
if I tell him that.

811
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:10,763
When will you stop

812
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:16,018
caring about your brother
and start caring about yourself?

813
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:20,523
Didn't you ever have a dream?

814
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:22,358
Something you wanted to do.

815
01:04:25,152 --> 01:04:26,320
Well...

816
01:04:27,154 --> 01:04:28,573
I had about three.

817
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:31,868
Two of them already came true.

818
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:33,661
What were they?

819
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:36,455
I wanted to go on a trip

820
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:38,541
instead of moving somewhere.

821
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:40,710
And?

822
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:45,965
I wanted to have a fight with my brother.

823
01:04:54,098 --> 01:04:55,099
It's lame, isn't it?

824
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,145
But you see,

825
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:03,691
I had a blast.

826
01:05:07,111 --> 01:05:08,112
I think...

827
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:10,948
I'm finally living a normal life.

828
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:20,416
What's the dream
that hasn't come true yet?

829
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:26,505
You came running to me today,

830
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:27,798
so I'll make it come true.

831
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:29,842
No.

832
01:05:30,676 --> 01:05:31,969
It's too late now.

833
01:05:32,553 --> 01:05:33,888
Why? What is it?

834
01:05:41,562 --> 01:05:43,189
Going to school in a uniform.

835
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:47,109
-What is this?
-What's that?

836
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:48,986
Hey, get up.

837
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:50,947
Eat up.

838
01:05:51,572 --> 01:05:53,282
My gosh, come on.

839
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:05,294
KO MUN-YEONG

840
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:24,814
What? Where are you going?

841
01:06:24,897 --> 01:06:27,066
Where are you going? Gang-tae!

842
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:28,567
Where are you going?

843
01:06:43,582 --> 01:06:44,583
Hey.

844
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:47,461
Hey... Excuse me. Hey.

845
01:06:52,466 --> 01:06:53,467
Well...

846
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:57,680
-Well--
-Gang-tae!

847
01:06:57,763 --> 01:06:59,306
Did you skip school today?

848
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:00,224
-Come here.
-No.

849
01:07:00,307 --> 01:07:02,184
-I just skipped the self-study time.
-Same thing.

850
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:04,270
Why do you even bother wearing a uniform?

851
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:06,188
-Why are you not at work?
-You little punk.

852
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:07,606
What...

853
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:16,198
Gosh, you're so annoying.

854
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:19,618
Excuse me.

855
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:22,079
-Hey, you. The girl with short hair.
-Stop it.

856
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:27,043
My brother has something to say to you.

857
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:29,670
-Can you please spare him some time?
-Will you stop?

858
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:31,005
Stop it.

859
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:33,758
She's coming.

860
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:37,053
She's coming here.

861
01:07:38,929 --> 01:07:40,765
Be a man. Impress her.

862
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:46,562
Hey.

863
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:49,065
I...

864
01:07:50,649 --> 01:07:51,484
Well...

865
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:52,943
I know you.

866
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:56,030
I saw you at school.

867
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:01,786
She knows you.

868
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:04,830
Well...

869
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:06,082
Congratulations.

870
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:08,584
Good luck.

871
01:08:22,014 --> 01:08:23,307
Sang-tae.

872
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:27,144
Yes?

873
01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:30,815
I...

874
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:36,487
I like her so much.

875
01:08:45,996 --> 01:08:47,206
I like her.

876
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,343
I like her.

877
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:08,644
What?

878
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:24,827
"Happy."

879
01:09:28,205 --> 01:09:29,582
He's happy.

880
01:09:42,761 --> 01:09:43,804
Gang-tae is...

881
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:47,683
He's

882
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:50,978
happy.

883
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:55,691
Gang... Gang-tae

884
01:09:56,442 --> 01:10:00,112
He's... He's happy.

885
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:01,739
Yes.

886
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:04,742
That's right.

887
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:07,703
Yes.

888
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:12,791
My brother...

889
01:10:14,251 --> 01:10:16,670
He's happy.

890
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:26,764
Gang-tae is happy.

891
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:30,226
Gang-tae is happy.

892
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:34,313
I... I've never seen him like this.
This is the first time.

893
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:35,648
My goodness.

894
01:10:46,867 --> 01:10:48,953
Hey, why do you look so tired?

895
01:10:49,870 --> 01:10:52,915
Mr. Lee, I don't think
I'm fit for this house.

896
01:10:52,998 --> 01:10:54,500
I have nightmares all night,

897
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:56,043
and I get the creeps.

898
01:10:56,126 --> 01:10:57,127
My entire body aches--

899
01:10:57,211 --> 01:10:58,837
My gosh, that's enough.

900
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:00,965
Where's Mun-yeong?

901
01:11:01,465 --> 01:11:02,466
She's in her study.

902
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:11,100
Look at you
sitting in front of your laptop!

903
01:11:11,308 --> 01:11:12,810
It's been so long.

904
01:11:12,893 --> 01:11:14,979
What is it going to be about?

905
01:11:15,062 --> 01:11:17,356
I couldn't sleep a wink last night
because I was so excited.

906
01:11:17,648 --> 01:11:20,776
I bet it's going to be an amazing story.

907
01:11:20,859 --> 01:11:22,111
Wait.

908
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:25,072
Let me get ready first.

909
01:11:27,449 --> 01:11:30,035
I'm ready. Now, tell me. What is it?

910
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:31,662
Here.

911
01:11:37,751 --> 01:11:39,378
Is this

912
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:42,214
supposed to be similar to  Bumpety Boo ?

913
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:43,632
I don't have the storyline yet.

914
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:45,134
-What's the title?
-Undecided.

915
01:11:45,217 --> 01:11:46,969
-What's the underlying message?
-Unsure.

916
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:49,722
-When will it be ready?
-Someday.

917
01:11:52,016 --> 01:11:56,186
-So that means you have nothing.
-Probably.

918
01:11:58,856 --> 01:12:00,899
Who's going to be your illustrator?

919
01:12:02,776 --> 01:12:04,069
My best friend.

920
01:12:38,979 --> 01:12:40,314
Please make way.

921
01:12:57,623 --> 01:13:00,751
SANG-TAE

922
01:13:01,585 --> 01:13:02,836
-What's--
- Did you eat?

923
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:07,383
Did you eat?

924
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:15,849
I couldn't eat
because we had an emergency patient.

925
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:18,936
Are... Are you hungry?

926
01:13:19,978 --> 01:13:21,605
Yes, I'm starving.

927
01:13:22,022 --> 01:13:24,358
Come to the restaurant
We Are Family by 6 p.m.

928
01:13:24,441 --> 01:13:25,943
Meet me at We Are Family.

929
01:13:35,536 --> 01:13:36,578
Mun-yeong.

930
01:13:39,706 --> 01:13:41,542
-Mun-yeong?
-I'm going to stick to this subject.

931
01:13:41,625 --> 01:13:43,836
That's fine.
That's not what I was going to talk about.

932
01:13:45,879 --> 01:13:46,797
About your father...

933
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:54,221
His brain tumor came back.

934
01:13:55,222 --> 01:13:57,015
It's apparently inoperable.

935
01:13:57,975 --> 01:13:59,977
There's nothing they can do to save him.

936
01:14:01,645 --> 01:14:03,564
My dad died a long time ago

937
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:06,108
when I was 12.

938
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:10,404
He died already.
All that's left of him is his body.

939
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:14,283
Mun-yeong.

940
01:14:15,659 --> 01:14:18,036
Your father's brain is damaged.

941
01:14:18,704 --> 01:14:20,998
That is why his memory is all messed up.

942
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:23,333
His body and mind
isn't functioning together

943
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:25,127
so that's why he acts the way he does.

944
01:14:27,212 --> 01:14:28,630
But even so,

945
01:14:30,757 --> 01:14:34,219
he's still your one and only family.

946
01:14:34,928 --> 01:14:35,929
"Family"?

947
01:14:38,932 --> 01:14:40,309
I'm an orphan.

948
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:44,438
-Mun-yeong.
-Leave. I'm tired.

949
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:24,019
Where are you?

950
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:28,106
I'm hungry. Let's eat together.

951
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:34,112
Let me join. I want to go, too.
Where is that restaurant?

952
01:15:35,072 --> 01:15:36,907
Why not? Why can't I go?

953
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:56,760
Wait.

954
01:15:56,843 --> 01:16:00,013
The adult needs to eat first.
Then you can eat.

955
01:16:00,597 --> 01:16:04,226
-Okay.
-Did you wipe your hands?

956
01:16:04,309 --> 01:16:06,728
Did you? Here. Wipe your hands and eat.

957
01:16:56,194 --> 01:16:58,113
ORDER
TOTAL: 26,400 WON

958
01:17:00,365 --> 01:17:02,326
Was... Was it delicious?

959
01:17:02,409 --> 01:17:03,243
Are you full?

960
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:06,288
Yes.

961
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:07,706
I'm really full.

962
01:17:09,207 --> 01:17:10,500
My stomach might explode.

963
01:17:10,584 --> 01:17:12,586
Your... Your stomach shouldn't explode.

964
01:17:12,669 --> 01:17:15,005
If your stomach explodes, you'll die.

965
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:39,571
It... It's your allowance.

966
01:17:40,238 --> 01:17:42,491
"Customers give you tips,
bosses give bonuses."

967
01:17:42,574 --> 01:17:45,535
And older brothers give allowance.

968
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:48,497
Overspending is a sin.

969
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:50,290
Make sure you don't overspend.

970
01:17:50,374 --> 01:17:52,250
I'll... I'll give you more if you run out.

971
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:53,168
Don't worry.

972
01:18:02,844 --> 01:18:03,845
Thank you.

973
01:18:04,888 --> 01:18:07,057
I... I won't overspend it.

974
01:18:13,397 --> 01:18:15,107
ORDER
TOTAL: 46,200 WON

975
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:17,901
Buy me dinner, too.

976
01:18:23,281 --> 01:18:24,116
Darn it.

977
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:27,035
My gosh.

978
01:18:29,246 --> 01:18:30,288
Buy me dinner.

979
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:32,749
Pay for mine as well. Buy me dinner, too.

980
01:18:33,166 --> 01:18:34,000
Darn it.

981
01:18:34,584 --> 01:18:36,378
Why are you leaving me out?
Buy me dinner, too.

982
01:18:36,461 --> 01:18:37,462
Excuse me.

983
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:40,465
How much does she need to pay?

984
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:47,973
Then give me an allowance.

985
01:18:49,141 --> 01:18:50,517
No one gives me that kind of stuff,

986
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:52,310
and I don't have a family to eat with.

987
01:18:52,436 --> 01:18:53,937
I'm really an orphan now.

988
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:05,031
Let's go home.

989
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:08,618
Sang-tae.

990
01:19:12,456 --> 01:19:15,250
I want a big brother like you!

991
01:19:37,814 --> 01:19:39,357
Come on, Gang-tae!

992
01:19:50,911 --> 01:19:52,662
Ko Mun-yeong!

993
01:19:56,041 --> 01:19:56,875
Ko Mun-yeong...

994
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,462
Mun-yeong, get over here!

995
01:20:02,172 --> 01:20:04,549
Hurry... Hurry up, Mun-yeong.
Aren't you guys coming?

996
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:06,885
Ko Mun-yeong. Moon Gang-tae.
Let's go. Hurry up.

997
01:20:10,597 --> 01:20:11,431
Hurry...

998
01:20:37,165 --> 01:20:40,252
Sang-tae, do you know
the fairy tale called  The Ugly Duckling ?

999
01:20:42,921 --> 01:20:43,755
Yes.

1000
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:48,385
The... The other ducks are mean
to the ugly duckling.

1001
01:20:48,468 --> 01:20:50,011
They bully him

1002
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:52,264
because he looks different from them.

1003
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:54,516
So he gets really lonely

1004
01:20:55,183 --> 01:20:56,977
and leaves his family, right?

1005
01:21:01,231 --> 01:21:02,941
Mun-yeong, don't run down the stairs!

1006
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:05,277
You'll get hurt! It's dangerous!

1007
01:21:05,402 --> 01:21:06,820
Stop running.

1008
01:21:10,657 --> 01:21:12,367
What do you think would've happened

1009
01:21:12,951 --> 01:21:15,203
if the mother duck gave lots of love

1010
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:16,788
to the ugly duckling?

1011
01:21:17,497 --> 01:21:19,958
Then... Then it wouldn't have left.

1012
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:24,129
If the adult embraces the kids,

1013
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:27,591
the ducks and swans

1014
01:21:29,217 --> 01:21:31,136
can all get along
and live together just fine.

1015
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:34,639
Hey, duck. Chickens.

1016
01:21:34,848 --> 01:21:38,226
Don't fight with each other, okay?

1017
01:21:41,521 --> 01:21:42,480
Sang-tae.

1018
01:21:44,107 --> 01:21:47,193
Are you an adult
who knows how to embrace others?

1019
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:48,737
Yes.

1020
01:21:49,654 --> 01:21:53,825
I'm... I'm an adult. An adult.

1021
01:21:54,367 --> 01:21:55,368
I'm...

1022
01:21:56,453 --> 01:21:59,789
I'm an adult like Ko Gil-dong.

1023
01:22:43,917 --> 01:22:47,712
THE MURDER OF THE WITCH OF THE WEST

1024
01:24:41,326 --> 01:24:43,453
The family register isn't everything.

1025
01:24:43,536 --> 01:24:44,746
A family...

1026
01:24:44,829 --> 01:24:46,372
One, two, three.

1027
01:24:46,456 --> 01:24:48,625
You become a family
by taking a family portrait together.

1028
01:24:48,958 --> 01:24:49,918
GANG-TAE,
PHOTO STUDIO ADDRESS

1029
01:24:50,001 --> 01:24:52,378
I hate kids and animals.

1030
01:24:52,879 --> 01:24:53,755
Because they beg for love...

1031
01:24:54,339 --> 01:24:55,715
Let go. Let go of me.

1032
01:24:55,799 --> 01:24:56,883
It makes me grow fond of them.

1033
01:24:57,884 --> 01:24:59,969
What if the butterfly shows up again?

1034
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:02,597
Don't let the past trap you.

1035
01:25:03,181 --> 01:25:05,350
If we get stuck, we just have to
open the door and leave.

1036
01:25:05,433 --> 01:25:08,394
-You won't be able to see the door.
-I was finally

1037
01:25:08,478 --> 01:25:10,188
starting to get the urge

1038
01:25:10,897 --> 01:25:12,440
to live like everyone else.

1039
01:25:16,444 --> 01:25:18,446
