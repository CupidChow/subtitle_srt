1
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,234
Mun-yeong.

2
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:11,780
I love you.

3
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,199
Is that not it? Is it something else?

4
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:16,826
Will you please say something?

5
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:20,246
If you tell me you love me one more time,
I might just...

6
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,256
You might just what?

7
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,011
Do this?

8
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,669
My gosh, that darn deer.

9
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,380
Shut up, you stupid deer!

10
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,192
I love you.

11
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:48,019
FINAL CHAPTER
FINDING THE REAL FACE

12
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,023
"Memorandum.

13
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,485
I, Lee Sang-in, the CEO of SangSangESang,

14
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,154
-will do my best
- will do my best

15
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,447
-to publish
- to publish

16
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,574
-Moon Sang-tae's
- Moon Sang-tae's

17
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,244
-fairy-tale book. Lee Sang-in."
- fairy-tale book.

18
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,912
His handwriting is horrible.

19
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,163
Sang-tae.

20
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,499
MEMORANDUM

21
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:14,128
My gosh, I can't believe
you got him to write a memorandum.

22
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,339
You're amazing, Sang-tae.

23
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,677
But were you waiting here
just so you could show me this?

24
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,680
-No.
-Then did you miss me?

25
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,933
-Hey, boss.
-What?

26
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,769
I want to quit my part-time job.

27
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:33,731
-What?
-I want to quit working for you.

28
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,986
All of a sudden?

29
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,613
People always quit all of a sudden.

30
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,240
So I feel very sorry.

31
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,491
Why?

32
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,079
Is it because you want to get paid more?

33
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:53,042
Okay, fine. I'll raise your hourly wage
by 500 won...

34
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,295
No, I'll give you 1000 won more.

35
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,424
I want to be an illustrator,
not a part-timer.

36
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,092
What?

37
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,845
I want to become a real illustrator.

38
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,346
A real one.

39
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:12,770
No.

40
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:14,647
No, you can't.

41
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,442
This is way too sudden.

42
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,402
I won't accept it.

43
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,700
Sang-tae, if you must quit,
find me a replacement.

44
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:28,703
But that person needs to be
a great worker just like you.

45
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,872
I need to like them,
and they need to draw well,

46
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,790
and they need to have
a unique perspective.

47
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,049
I wanted to be really cool
when I let you go.

48
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,552
It's hard for you

49
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:48,973
to be cool. Let's be honest.

50
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,143
Sometimes, it's not too bad to lie.

51
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:54,437
No, I need to be honest.

52
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,398
You're way too honest.

53
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,134
Why did you hang my photo

54
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,639
on your mom's tree?

55
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,725
I thought she might want to see you.

56
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,229
Who did you tell her I was?

57
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,485
That you're Sang-tae's best friend

58
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,279
which is something she always longed for.

59
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,200
And that you're also

60
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,078
the woman I love.

61
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,792
I told her the three of us
are a family now

62
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,212
and that she shouldn't worry.

63
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,216
I feel like

64
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,762
she might really hate me.

65
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,973
Let's be honest.

66
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,603
You're not exactly likable.

67
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:19,981
Are you kidding me?

68
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,525
Why do you want to be liked by others?

69
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,610
Just be good to me.

70
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:31,951
I'm sleepy.

71
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:35,955
I'm sleepy.

72
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,167
I said I'm sleepy.

73
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,211
Okay, let's sleep.

74
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,172
-Okay.
-Let's sleep.

75
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,175
Okay, let's go.

76
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,594
No, I didn't say "Let's go."
I said, "Let's sleep."

77
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,846
You're going to sleep here?

78
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,766
No, let's go. I'll give you a ride.

79
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,312
I already told Gang-tae
that I'm going to sleep here.

80
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,190
-Why?
-So they can make up.

81
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,817
They need to make up on their own.

82
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:08,654
If I get involved,
I'll only end up disturbing them.

83
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,448
They won't be able to reconcile.

84
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,493
Jae... Jae-su, you can sleep here, too.

85
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,746
And by the way,
I really hope you don't snore.

86
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,041
Get... Get sinus surgery or something.

87
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:21,542
Sang-tae.

88
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,801
When will I ever become
a big brother like you?

89
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:32,678
You need a sibling.

90
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,890
You'll be a big brother
once your parents have another baby.

91
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,685
Gosh, I just want to be
your little brother.

92
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,208
Careful. I'm holding a knife.

93
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:48,963
I realized

94
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,049
that I forgot to tell you something.

95
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,384
What's that?

96
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,095
I'm jobless now.

97
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,435
You quit your job?

98
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:04,854
-Yes.
-Why?

99
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,647
I want to try new things.

100
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:10,484
Don't tell me you're really
thinking of going to school.

101
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,112
I'll study for
the national college entrance exam--

102
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,030
No.

103
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,407
If you must, get your degree online.

104
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,326
I don't need your permission.

105
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,661
Why would you study
when you've worked hard all your life?

106
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:21,746
Don't bother.

107
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,540
Don't bother doing anything.
Just stay right by my side

108
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,125
like a parasite.

109
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,670
I told you I'm holding a knife.

110
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,131
I take that back.

111
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,300
I didn't mean to say "parasite."

112
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:40,348
What's your plan? You told me
you're not going to write anymore.

113
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,852
There's nothing I want to write about.

114
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:46,979
Then what about that story

115
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:50,191
where those three people
go on a trip in a camping car?

116
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,361
I've been looking forward to that.

117
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,321
Do you want to read it?

118
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:57,698
I want to show it off.

119
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,827
You and Sang-tae worked on it.

120
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:04,914
So I want to show it off to people.

121
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:08,918
Follow me.

122
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,133
Take a look.

123
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,056
Sang-tae drew it.

124
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,728
It's Moon Gang-tae
wearing a really happy smile on his face.

125
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,065
While you were sleeping,

126
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:33,359
you apparently smiled like that
saying you like someone.

127
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,529
You must really like her

128
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,406
seeing that you confessed
your feelings for her

129
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,740
even in your dream.

130
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:42,743
Yes.

131
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:49,834
This doesn't

132
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,713
look like me.

133
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,218
After I saw this drawing,

134
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,804
I made some changes to the story.

135
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,557
But I can't tell you the ending.

136
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:05,975
You're

137
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:07,893
going to publish the book?

138
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,479
Well, I'm going to publish this one.

139
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,523
But I don't know about the future.

140
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:20,823
Do you like it?

141
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,826
Yes, I like it.

142
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,832
Who do you like better? Me or Sang-tae?

143
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:33,752
The person I like the most

144
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,592
is myself.

145
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,137
I'm home!

146
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,185
-Sang-tae, did you eat?
-Yes.

147
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,688
Darn, that sly fox.

148
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,234
Do you like me more?

149
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,321
Check.

150
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:05,159
My gosh, I can't believe
I didn't see that coming.

151
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,328
I lost again.

152
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,371
What do you want this time?

153
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:13,667
Sausage? Corn? Chocolate?

154
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:18,130
It's hard to keep
losing on purpose, isn't it?

155
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,426
You make it way too obvious.

156
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:27,014
You just seemed really down these days.

157
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,517
You pretended to lose all the time

158
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:33,479
and bought me food
so you could cheer me up?

159
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:34,980
My goodness.

160
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:37,650
Take this.

161
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,402
What is it?

162
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,950
It's my last prescription for you
as your doctor.

163
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,161
Put them on and walk out of here.

164
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:53,332
Don’t shut your eyes

165
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,710
and pretend like you can't find the exit.

166
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,172
Leave with those shoes on,
and don't return until you find the door.

167
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:04,385
My goodness, what in the world...

168
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,479
Do they fit?

169
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,232
They fit perfectly.

170
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,186
Goodness.

171
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,646
I feel so bad for him.

172
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:03,277
-Byeol, I changed this.
-Dad, it hurts!

173
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,821
-So can you...
-Dad, it hurts! It hurts!

174
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,699
-"Dad"?
-Didn't he say "It hurts"?

175
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,534
I think he said both.

176
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,537
Dad, it hurts! It really hurts, Dad!

177
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:17,791
Fire him right now.

178
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,337
I was going to quit anyway.

179
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,008
-My gosh.
-He just called him "Dad," right?

180
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,510
Then is he Director O's son?
The one he had a bit late?

181
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,931
That explains why
he was always so arrogant.

182
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,182
Gosh, that hurts.

183
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,354
I thought he'd grow up

184
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,731
if I made him work for me,
but he's hopeless.

185
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,816
I'm going to take him with me
when I retire.

186
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,027
So keep that in mind, and have a good day.

187
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,779
You come here.

188
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:49,490
Gosh, you're hurting me!

189
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:50,532
Unbelievable.

190
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,077
He doesn't look like his dad at all.

191
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,205
Not all children look like their parents.

192
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,042
You quit your part-time job?

193
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,585
Yes.

194
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,546
That means we're all jobless.

195
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,632
We really are alike.

196
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:10,511
By the way, did you guys make up?

197
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,973
It's better to kiss than to fight.

198
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,599
Don't worry, Sang-tae.

199
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,268
We not only kissed,
but we also French kissed.

200
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,025
French... French kissed?

201
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:28,612
Yes, but that wasn't enough, so we even...

202
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,037
Gosh, why do you keep kicking me?

203
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,624
-Did I?
-Yes, you kicked me twice.

204
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,793
Damn it,
my ankle bone hurts like hell now.

205
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:45,546
Sang-tae.

206
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,633
Mun-yeong decided to publish the book
that you guys have been working on.

207
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,427
Really... Really?

208
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,680
You did such an excellent job
on your homework,

209
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:58,225
so I decided to give you a reward
by publishing the book.

210
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:00,728
I'm getting a reward.

211
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,438
But I can't give you a camping car.

212
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:09,111
Why... Why not?
You... You signed the contract.

213
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,156
"The employer will buy the employee

214
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,450
a walk through van camping car
instead of paying him."

215
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,617
That was in the contract.

216
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,161
Yes, I know.

217
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,538
But the problem is the sentence
that comes after that.

218
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,206
The sentence that comes after that?

219
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:24,626
"The employee has a little brother
who doesn't like to move."

220
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:25,586
Exactly.

221
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:28,839
But that little brother
no longer needs to move.

222
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,508
So you don't need a camping car anymore.

223
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,429
Hey, stop trying to be funny.

224
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,390
I'll just pay you instead. You like money.

225
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,517
Yes... Yes, I like money.

226
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,353
-Sang-tae.
-I... I need money when I'm old.

227
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,856
Money... Money isn't everything in life.

228
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,691
But I also need to give pocket money.

229
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,318
Then I'll pay you. Do we have a deal?

230
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,652
Yes, we have a deal.

231
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:56,742
Darn it.

232
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:02,581
When... When are we
going to get back to work?

233
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,750
-Right away.
-"Right away"?

234
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,337
You guys really are best friends.

235
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,298
Mun... Mun-yeong, use your spoon
when you eat quail eggs.

236
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,425
Don't be stubborn when things don't work.

237
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,761
You need to learn to try other methods.

238
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,638
You need to stop nagging.

239
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,109
How are you going to take responsibility
for this issue?

240
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,069
When have I ever taken responsibility?

241
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,571
Well...

242
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,534
You lied and announced
that our company is going to publish

243
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,911
the last book
of  The Murder of the Witch of the West .

244
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:44,998
And now, people in this business
think I'm a fraud.

245
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,543
My reputation has hit rock bottom.
What are you going to do now?

246
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,460
Pick it back up.

247
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,924
If you wanted to use
the manuscript as bait,

248
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:56,176
you could've just messed
with Suicide Bomber.

249
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,595
Why did you also have to get me involved?

250
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,556
Here.

251
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:02,850
What's this?

252
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,939
MYSTERY CRIME FICTION
THE MURDER OF THE WITCH OF THE WEST 10

253
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,734
Oh, my gosh.

254
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,611
The Murder of the Witch of the West .

255
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,157
You really had this?

256
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,617
That's the one and only copy.

257
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,371
You can throw it away or publish it.
It's up to you.

258
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:26,665
If you publish it,

259
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,208
you'll make enough money

260
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,919
to make up for all the money you spent
bribing people because of me.

261
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,382
-Mun-yeong.
-Now, choose.

262
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,259
Choose what?

263
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,347
This is the revised manuscript
of my last book.

264
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,348
This is great.

265
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,143
You can't have both.

266
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,773
You can either publish my mother's book

267
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,694
or mine. The choice is yours.

268
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,424
I'm not going to publish a book
that was written by someone

269
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,676
who gave you so much pain

270
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,346
just so I can make a fortune.

271
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,562
Are you sure you won't regret it?

272
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,315
You'd benefit a lot more
from Do Hui-jae's last book

273
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,526
than Ko Mun-yeong's last book.

274
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:42,282
Mun-yeong, I like your books a lot better
than your mother's.

275
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:47,287
Do you want to eat something fancy?
How about some beef?

276
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:49,998
Beef sounds nice.

277
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,419
You're going to pay, right?

278
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:02,386
Gosh, I'm sick of always
being so constipated.

279
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,139
What? Where did they go?

280
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,017
Should I clean this up for you?

281
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,603
Yes. Thank you.

282
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,438
My gosh.

283
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,024
That cheap jerk.

284
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:25,534
My goodness, that's great.

285
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:31,581
I can't believe Sang-tae is really
going to make his debut as an illustrator.

286
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:32,958
Yes, of course.

287
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,043
We're going to sign a contract with him

288
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,254
and have him work
with other writers as well.

289
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:41,383
Mun-yeong told me
she won't be writing for a while.

290
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:42,884
You have a point.

291
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:47,347
He should work with different writers
to become a better illustrator.

292
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,265
Exactly.

293
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:53,937
My goodness.

294
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:58,859
Sang-in, I'm going to miss you so much
when you move to Seoul.

295
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:01,778
I got some good rest.

296
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:04,698
So I should find a new office
and start anew.

297
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,867
When is that going to be?

298
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,037
Once I find a new office.

299
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:16,335
So you should enjoy my company
while I'm still around.

300
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,511
-Mr. Lee.
-Hey, you're here.

301
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,473
You ignored all my texts and calls,

302
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,349
but you're here dehulling bean sprouts?

303
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:34,978
Hey, why are you empty-handed?
Where's the manuscript?

304
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,396
What manuscript?

305
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,859
The Murder of the Witch of the West .
I told you to bring it with you.

306
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:42,611
"The Murder of the Witch of the West" ?

307
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,404
Are you sure it wasn't a dream?

308
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:49,618
What are you talking about?
I even sent you a text.

309
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,162
I didn't get a text.
I didn't get anything.

310
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:53,497
Look. I'll show you...

311
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:57,167
Seung-jae, we hit the jackpot.

312
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,795
I have the copy
for  The Murder of the Witch of the West.

313
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,922
This is our last hope
and source of income.

314
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:04,841
So make sure you bring
the manuscript on the table.

315
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,177
Don't forget to bring it, okay?
Don't forget!

316
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:15,185
Lee Sang-in, that darn peddler.

317
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,948
SEONGJIN DETENTION CENTER

318
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,804
You really came.

319
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,559
This will be the last time you see me.

320
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,020
How long do you think
they will stay with you?

321
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:02,732
-We're a family.
-How are they your family?

322
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:19,833
My baby.

323
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,546
I love you so much.

324
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,508
You're so precious to me.

325
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,263
I wanted you to live like me.

326
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,849
I didn't want you to be swayed by others.

327
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:38,518
I wanted you to devour your surroundings
and live as a strong woman.

328
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,313
That's not too hard.

329
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:44,232
You just need to follow your instincts.

330
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,693
But why...

331
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,155
Why would you hang around
with those jerks--

332
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,072
I'm relieved.

333
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:54,784
What?

334
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,995
I almost turned into a demon like you,

335
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,997
and I'm so relieved that I didn't.

336
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,832
-Ko Mun-yeong!
-I...

337
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:05,629
really feel sorry for you, Mom.

338
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:10,967
The fact that you don't even know
that you're pitiful

339
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:13,678
makes me pity you even more.

340
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,390
You only have an appetite.

341
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,101
But you know nothing about warmth.

342
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:23,813
You won't ever know.

343
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:27,275
And you're not even interested.

344
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:31,446
That's why

345
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:35,408
we're different.

346
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,079
Unlike you, I've learned

347
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:44,167
how warm

348
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,338
and nice it feels.

349
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,633
"Warmth"?

350
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,265
But even so,

351
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,892
don't skip your meals.

352
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,230
I'll try my best

353
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,900
to erase you from my memory.

354
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,569
You'll never be able to erase me.

355
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,450
Never!

356
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:20,620
You will never be able to erase me
from your memory!

357
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,247
Never!

358
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:27,085
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

359
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,059
You erased the butterfly.

360
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:46,563
No... No, I didn't erase it.

361
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,649
I just... I just painted over it.

362
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,943
You can't tell, right?

363
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,821
Now, I just need to draw a new butterfly.

364
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:59,034
Never! You will never

365
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:02,787
be able to erase me
from your memory! Never!

366
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,214
See?

367
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,551
You can't erase me.

368
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,430
You and I are the same.

369
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,315
Butterfly.

370
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:36,071
You told me that the word "psycho"
comes from the word  psyche.

371
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,199
But to us,

372
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:41,951
it's a symbol of cure.

373
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,372
A cure that heals our soul.

374
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,082
You should remember that.

375
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,304
You're right.

376
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:04,140
If you can't erase it,

377
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,813
you just need to cover it
with something better.

378
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:11,773
Right?

379
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:15,110
Butterfly is  psyche ,
and it symbolizes cure.

380
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:18,822
A butterfly that cures.
It's a kind butterfly.

381
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:21,074
Do... Do you want me to paint one?

382
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:24,285
Do you want to see?
Do you want to see me draw it?

383
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,832
Yes. Draw one that looks nice and pretty.

384
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:31,918
Okay. A nice and pretty butterfly.

385
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,253
It cures.

386
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,596
Welcome.

387
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,105
Cut the crap.

388
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:57,193
HIRING PART-TIMER
NO EXPERIENCE REQUIRED

389
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:00,697
I heard you quit.

390
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,242
Yes, I'm going to study now.

391
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:05,827
Goodness.

392
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,871
Should I close the shop

393
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,415
and study with you as well?

394
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,461
We can both get a better education.

395
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:16,546
Should I give it a shot?

396
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,632
-Jae-su.
-Yes?

397
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:23,178
Do you really want to study for the exam
and go to college?

398
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,058
-No, not at all.
-Exactly.

399
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:32,520
Don't try to follow what I do.

400
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,856
Do what you really want to do,

401
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,276
and go where you want to go.

402
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,069
What does that mean?

403
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,531
Are you telling me to get lost

404
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,492
because you don't need me anymore?

405
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,870
Are you saying I'm worthless and nuggety?

406
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:49,871
It's "nugatory."

407
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,916
You just pronounced it
like chicken nuggets.

408
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:58,254
Exactly. I'm so angry and upset at you

409
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,632
that I feel like a useless piece
of chicken nugget.

410
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:09,682
Hey, big brother.

411
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:13,812
My big brother, Jae-su.

412
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:15,980
What's the matter with you?

413
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,733
I'll treat you like an older brother now.

414
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,028
You're a year older than me.

415
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,780
I thought you didn't want a big brother.

416
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:25,698
What's with the sudden change?

417
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:29,410
Now that I think about it,

418
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,623
it's better to have a lot of big brothers.

419
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,753
I was able to hang in there

420
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:41,673
because you were always there

421
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,386
by my side.

422
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:49,681
You made me laugh,

423
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:52,976
helped me breathe,

424
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,021
and made me feel less lonely.

425
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,402
Thank you, Jae-su.

426
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,580
You punk.

427
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,750
Then you'd better be good to me, okay?

428
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:20,336
Okay, I'll be good.

429
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:23,965
Call me "big brother."

430
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:25,967
My big brother.

431
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,346
-One more time.
-My big brother, Jae-su.

432
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,223
One more time.

433
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:34,475
That's enough.

434
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,020
-The box.
-The box...

435
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,980
He's sleeping right now.

436
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:45,653
Here, they're having fun on a picnic.

437
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,530
They're... They're in the forest.

438
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:51,492
This... This is  psyche .

439
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,745
She's having fun with a butterfly.

440
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:55,747
-Okay, next.
-Okay.

441
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:59,125
This... This is the Box Man.

442
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:02,754
But... But I need to draw it again. Pass.

443
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:05,048
And here, she has a frog on her head.

444
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:10,720
Come on.

445
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:13,723
The eyes of the Emotionless Princess
are too small. Make them bigger.

446
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:15,642
You... You want them to be bigger?

447
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:18,603
How... How much?
One centimeter or two centimeters?

448
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:20,605
Make them half the size of her face.

449
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:23,733
That... That'll be unrealistic.

450
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,318
She's not the big-eyed frog
from  The Boy Frog .

451
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:27,153
-Have some fruit.
-My gosh.

452
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:29,656
No. You can't see it.

453
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,616
Leave.
Outsiders are not allowed to be here.

454
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:33,326
Why am I an outsider?

455
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:35,745
Yes, you're an outsider.
That's why you should stay outside.

456
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:37,789
Let me stay and watch. I'm so bored.

457
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:39,540
No, that's out of the question. Get out.

458
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,084
Sang-tae.

459
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:42,877
But...

460
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,257
You're just going to leave me here?

461
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,009
What else would I do?

462
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,805
Didn't you push me out on purpose?

463
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:56,724
Why would I do that?

464
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,611
-Are you done?
-Yes.

465
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:09,821
-Let me see.
-Here.

466
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:12,073
-What is this?
-I drew the eyes bigger.

467
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,533
It's horrible!

468
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:18,955
My goodness.

469
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:23,501
The Murder of the Witch of the West .
Will you please show up?

470
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:26,963
Hey.

471
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:30,299
Stop doing such a lousy job
and really look for it, will you?

472
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,389
Seung-jae, aren't you going to answer me?

473
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,893
Mr. Lee.

474
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:45,189
I thought you promised not to publish
The Murder of the Witch of the West .

475
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,861
Of course I'm not going to publish it.

476
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:53,740
But I just want to be prepared
for the future.

477
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:57,118
I'm just going to think of it
like an installment savings account.

478
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,327
That's all there is to it.

479
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:02,248
If this is just for you,
then why must I help you look for it?

480
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,417
Hey.

481
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,545
Don't you know whose fault this is?

482
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:10,256
Had you not left the manuscript
at the coffee shop,

483
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:11,591
I wouldn't have had to

484
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:14,052
go through the trash
like a feral cat, you fool.

485
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,554
What? You jerk!

486
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:17,638
What?

487
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,016
What did you say? Hey.

488
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,477
Hey, do you not even give a damn anymore?

489
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,228
Right, I quit!

490
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:27,940
I hope you find  The Murder of the Witch
of the West  and have a good life!

491
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:32,653
-Hey, Seung-jae!
-What? You jerk!

492
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,961
Gosh, what is this smell?

493
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:53,633
Seung-jae,
doesn't something smell funky in here?

494
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,344
What?

495
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:01,641
It's not me.
I took a shower as soon as I got home.

496
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:03,059
I see.

497
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,604
Gosh, it really stinks in here.

498
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,315
Jeez. I'll keep the door open.

499
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,820
SANG-IN
JU-RI, ARE YOU DOING ANYTHING RIGHT NOW?

500
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:28,251
I thought it'd be too boring
to drink solo.

501
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:36,300
I guess the stench from you
followed Seung-jae all the way to my room.

502
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,844
Oh, no. Do I still stink?

503
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,595
I washed up so I thought it'd be okay.

504
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:43,391
I'm sure I'll get used to the smell
in a few minutes.

505
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:44,892
All right.

506
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:52,441
Seung-jae is still really mad at me,
isn't she?

507
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:54,152
Did you pick on her again?

508
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:56,028
Don't be so mean to that kid.

509
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,865
What? "Kid"?

510
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:03,035
Seung-jae is at least
six years older than you.

511
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:03,953
What?

512
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:07,957
But she always uses honorifics
when she's talking to me.

513
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,293
Oh, that?

514
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:13,337
She likes to act young and slow-witted

515
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,173
because she believes

516
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:17,675
that it's a surefire way
to an easy, cushy life.

517
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,303
When I think about that,
I do feel bad for her, but... Gosh.

518
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,013
How sly.

519
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:25,349
So she's actually older than me?

520
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,226
Are you sure?

521
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,187
Yes, she is older than you. My goodness.

522
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:33,232
You work at a psychiatric hospital.

523
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:36,444
I can't believe
you're such a bad judge of character.

524
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:39,322
I should teach you a thing or two.

525
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:41,866
When I see someone, I can tell
what kind of person he or she is.

526
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,550
God, I'm about to puke.

527
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:12,563
Lee Sang-in, this is your punishment
for picking on me.

528
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:18,277
I'll let him stress out for a month
and then return it to him.

529
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:04,532

Mun-yeong! Your new book is finally out!

532
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:43,112
Mr. Moon Sang-tae!
The book has been published.

533
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,783
Finding the Real Face.

534
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:51,412
I've got the first edition here,
still hot off the press.

535
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:54,457
You've waited so long for this, Mr. Moon.

536
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,459
My gosh, thank you.

537
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,794
Finding the Real Face.

538
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:02,048
"Illustrations by Moon Sang-tae."
Moon Sang-tae!

539
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:04,508
That's my name, Moon Sang-tae.

540
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,635
-Are you excited?
-Yes, of course.

541
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:09,013
I'm super excited and happy right now.

542
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,223
Look, there's a photo of me right here.
My gosh!

543
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,351
Congratulations on your debut, Mr. Moon!

544
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,520
-My gosh. I worked on this book,
-Oh, my.

545
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,689
Finding the Real Face.

546
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:20,483
Sang-tae, where are you going? Sang-tae!

547
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:24,362
Hey, I'm coming too. Wait up!

548
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:29,492
Jeez, I keep getting a bad feeling.

549
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:31,619
I don't think this book will do well.

550
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:35,206
-Why do you say that?
-This isn't her usual writing style.

551
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:37,333
Mun-yeong has changed,
and so has her writing style.

552
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:41,462
If only I'd managed to get my hands
on  The Murder of the Witch of the West ,

553
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,339
I wouldn't be this worried
and anxious now.

554
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,759
Don't worry too much, Mr. Lee.

555
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:51,263
You know that your gut feelings
have always been wrong.

556
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:53,307
Jeez, you little...

557
00:39:57,186 --> 00:40:00,398
Mom. Mom!

558
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,067
Mom.

559
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:06,195
Do you see this, Mom? This right here.

560
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:10,741
It's my name, Mom. "Moon Sang-tae."

561
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:14,620
My name... My name is Moon Sang-tae, Mom.

562
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:17,832
I'm an illustrator now.
A professional illustrator.

563
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:21,043
Do you want to see my illustrations, Mom?

564
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:24,713
Look, I drew all of these. This one too.

565
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:28,050
And I can even draw
facial expressions now.

566
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:29,969
-Sang-tae.
-Yes.

567
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,640
Mom is probably very curious
as to what the book is about.

568
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,434
-Why don't you read it to her?
-Sure!

569
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,769
I'm very good at narrating stories.

570
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:42,481
I can use different voices for Ddochi,
Douner, and Dooly. You know that, right?

571
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:43,399
Of course, I know.

572
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:46,902
Mom, I'll read the book out loud to you!

573
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:50,614
" Finding the Real Face.

574
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:52,658
Story by Ko Mun-yeong.

575
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:55,327
Illustrations by Moon Sang-tae."

576
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:58,038
I'll read you the story, Mom.
It'll be fun.

577
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,707
" Finding the Real Face.

578
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,420
Once upon a time
in a castle in the deep forest,

579
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:08,507
there lived three people
who had their real faces stolen

580
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:11,343
by the Shadow Witch.

581
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:15,556
The boy wore a mask with an awkward smile.

582
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:18,559
Then there was the princess
who was loud but all empty inside,

583
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:22,271
and there was also a man
who was trapped inside a box.

584
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:25,816
They couldn't make any facial expressions
because their faces were stolen from them.

585
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,027
They had no way of understanding
each other's feelings,

586
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:31,447
so they always misunderstood one another
and fought."

587
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:36,452
My eyes are welling up with tears
even though I'm so happy,

588
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:37,828
my brother and sister.

589
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:42,124
Mom, don't the illustrations look so good?

590
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,918
"Illustrations by Moon Sang-tae."

591
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:48,005
I'm a professional illustrator now.

592
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:51,258
-You did an excellent job.
-I know. "Moon Sang-tae," Mom.

593
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:54,303
I did a great job, Mom!

FINDING THE REAL FACE

596
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:10,236
Seung-jae, I think we need more chairs.

597
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:13,239
Oh, the hospital staff said
they'll just stand.

598
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:17,743
No, I mean...
There are no seats for the press.

599
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:20,579
Oh, I sent out the press release,

600
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:23,624
but because of the lie we told
about  The Murder of the Witch of the West ,

601
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:25,709
they all think we're lying again.

602
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:28,337
Only one reporter will be attending.

603
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:31,173
Which reporter?

604
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:36,845
Reporter Yoo.

605
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:39,056
-Who?
-Me.

606
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:40,933
Reporter Yoo Seung-jae.

607
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:48,023
I'm going to record the entire event
and upload it to my channel.

608
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,572
I thought you were a total quack,

609
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:57,241
but you are a competent doctor after all.

610
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:58,951
You helped Sang-tae

611
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:03,080
spread his wings and fly
like those butterflies.

612
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:07,418
Gosh, I didn't do anything.
He did it all on his own.

613
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,048
By the way, you look nice today.

614
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:16,969
What's with that cheesy comment?

615
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:22,474
Can I stop by your place for some food
from time to time?

616
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:24,476
I used to do that often, you know.

617
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,520
I'd peek over the wall and go,

618
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:31,150
"Sun-deok! Let's hang out!"

619
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:33,694
What's with you? Have you lost your mind?

620
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,321
Are you really going senile or what?

621
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:37,239
Gosh, seriously...

622
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:39,366
Director O.

623
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,496
My gosh, look who's here.

624
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:51,128
That scarf is beautiful.

625
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,758
I thought my neck would look too bare
without it.

626
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:59,678
I splurged and bought it on sale
at the department store

627
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,806
because I heard today is an important day.

628
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:06,352
Great purchase. It looks amazing on you.

629
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:13,275
Oh, right. Please visit my restaurant
when you have some time.

630
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,277
I'll make delicious braised fish for you.

OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

632
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,206
All right, the book launch party
will begin shortly.

633
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:29,083
Let's all head over to the therapy room.

634
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:30,751
Let's go.

635
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,836
-Shall we?
-Let's head back inside.

636
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,051
Jeong-tae!

637
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:40,344
Jeong-tae!

638
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:41,637
A-reum!

639
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:50,062
-How have you been?
-What about you?

640
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:51,146
I've been well.

641
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:52,981
I missed you.

642
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:57,694
By the way, I don't see
that handsome caregiver anywhere.

643
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:59,571
Oh, he'll be here.

644
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:07,121
I guess his son
still hasn't learned his lesson.

645
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:08,747
Gosh, he's handsome.

646
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:12,209
Why am I so nervous?

647
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:20,259
Seung-jae.

648
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,011
Jae-su.

649
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:39,236
Excuse me.

650
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:41,363
Gi-do.

651
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:44,700
Ju-ri, it's been so long!
How have you been?

652
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:47,286
Oh, my. He's totally my type.

653
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,081
You look like a different person now.

654
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,584
Are you preparing
for the civil service exam?

655
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:57,045
Yes. As you know, my dad is no longer
an assemblyman because of me.

656
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,673
It's okay. You can laugh.

657
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:03,844
So I'm trying to follow suit
and work for the government.

658
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:06,013
Gosh, that's why I'm racking my brain
to study hard.

659
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:07,431
I'm proud of you.

660
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:12,227
But where's my handsome Gang-tae
and that fiery writer?

661
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:14,771
I should narrate the story
because I wrote it.

662
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:16,190
Why would you butt in?

663
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:19,610
Ko Mun-yeong,
I drew all the illustrations,

664
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:22,654
which means half of the book is mine.
And I'm also good at narrating stories.

665
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:26,742
-Are you an attention seeker?
-What? What's that?

666
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:30,370
A seeker? Do they look for things?
What is that?

667
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,873
Jeez. Enough, both of you.

668
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:34,500
We'll be late. Let's go.

669
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:36,877
Anyhow, I can't let you
read from the book. Stay out of it.

670
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,880
No. We worked on it together,
so it's only fair that I do it with you.

671
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,548
-Just stay out of it.
-I don't want to.

672
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,008
-Just stay out of it!
-No!

673
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:44,927
If you keep fighting,
neither of you can do it.

674
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,261
I'll narrate the entire book.

675
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:50,599
-Stay out of it.
-No way.

676
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:52,518
-Just do as I say.
-I don't want to.

677
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,353
BOOK LAUNCH
FINDING THE REAL FACE

678
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:56,480
WITH WRITER KO MUN-YEONG
AND ILLUSTRATOR MOON SANG-TAE

679
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:57,648
All right.

680
00:46:57,731 --> 00:47:01,693
I'd like to thank you all
for attending this meaningful event

681
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:05,822
that signals the children's book publisher
SangSangESang's new beginning.

682
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:11,036
And I'd also like to extend
my sincere gratitude to Director O Ji-wang

683
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:16,208
and OK Psychiatric Hospital's staff
for preparing this venue.

684
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:17,834
Let's get started right away.

685
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:20,921
The children's book author,
Ms. Ko Mun-yeong,

686
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:25,008
and the illustrator, Mr. Moon Sang-tae,
will read their hot new release,

687
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:29,388
Finding The Real Face,

688
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:32,391
which was born
out of their fantastic collaboration.

689
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:42,693
FINDING THE REAL FACE

690
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:49,825
"Once upon a time
in a castle in the deep forest,

691
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:54,371
there lived three people
who had their real faces stolen

692
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:57,916
by the Shadow Witch."

693
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:04,673
"The Box Man spoke.

694
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:07,884
'If we want to stop fighting
and find happiness,

695
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:11,138
we must retrieve our stolen faces.'"

696
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:14,683
"So they hopped in their camping car

697
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:18,020
and began their journey
to find their faces.

698
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:21,106
Then one day, they ran into a mother fox

699
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:24,610
who was bawling, curled up on the snow."

700
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:28,405
"The Masked Boy asked the mother fox.

701
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:31,491
'Ma'am, why do you keep crying?'"

702
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:34,786
"'Oh, I came out here to find some food

703
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:37,122
but dropped my baby
whom I was carrying on my back

704
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:40,334
somewhere in the snow.'"

705
00:48:40,917 --> 00:48:43,003
"The mother fox's tears had run dry.

706
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:45,130
She wailed while beating her chest.

707
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:49,635
When the Masked Boy saw that,
warm tears started gushing from his eyes."

708
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:55,015
"Then the snow began to melt quickly,

709
00:48:55,891 --> 00:49:00,520
and the baby fox, who was frozen
under the snow, soon appeared."

710
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:05,233
"The three of them resumed their journey.

711
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:07,361
Soon, they ran into a clown

712
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:10,822
who was dancing naked
in a field of thorny flowers.

713
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:14,368
The Emotionless Princess asked,

714
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:17,454
'Why are you dancing with all your might,

715
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:19,373
knowing you'll be pricked by the thorns?'

716
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:23,835
'I feel that this is the only way
to make people look at me.

717
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:28,465
But it hurts,

718
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,509
and no one's looking at me.' He answered.

719
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:35,097
Then the Emotionless Princess
walked into the field of thorny flowers

720
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:39,351
and started dancing with the clown.

721
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:43,313
'I'm an empty can, so I won't be hurt
even if I get pricked by the thorns.'

722
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:48,276
When she began hopping and dancing,

723
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:52,531
loud clanking noises echoed

724
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:55,283
from her empty torso.

725
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:58,787
And upon hearing those sounds,
people began to flock to where they were.

726
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:00,789
The crowd watched their dance

727
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:02,833
and applauded them.

728
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:05,794
-That moment--"
-"That moment..."

729
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:10,799
-"That moment--"
-"That moment--"

730
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,970
-"That moment--"
-"That moment--"

731
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:16,388
"That moment..."

732
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:19,641
-"That--"
-"That moment..."

733
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:23,603
-Damn it. It's my turn.
-No, it's my turn. Look, this part.

734
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:26,481
-It's my turn.
-Look! "Mun-yeong" is written right here.

735
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:29,025
-"Mun-yeong."
-No, I see my name. Why steal my part?

736
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:31,653
-This is my part.
-Can one of you just continue?

737
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:33,905
Just stop.
If you want to read, do it properly.

738
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:35,532
Why do you keep stopping between words?

739
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:36,908
This is better than being boring.

740
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,827
That man yawned when you were reading it.

741
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:39,911
-Your part was boring.
-Damn it.

742
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:41,830
Just do as I say and don't butt in!

743
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:44,624
"Damn" is a bad word. It's a swear word.

744
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:47,210
Are you swearing at me?
At your big brother?

745
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:48,712
Are you going to swear at me?

746
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:50,630
-This is all your fault.
-Are you yelling at me?

747
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,549
You said, "Damn it" while I was reading.

748
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:54,509
Forget it. I'm out.
You can do it by yourself.

749
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:56,011
Are you yelling at me right now?

750
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:58,180
-Why are you angry?
-They're really something.

751
00:50:58,263 --> 00:50:59,931
-Hey! Look who's talking.
-What?

752
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,641
-Why are you all riled up?
-What about you?

753
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:02,851
-Why are you angry?
-You're...

754
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:05,187
-Quiet down, both of you!
-I quit. I'm out.

755
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:07,939
-Why are you yelling at me?
-This is all your fault.

756
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:10,066
-I told you!
-You ruined everything!

757
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,693
-You ruined everything.
-It's your fault!

758
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:13,361
-You ruined it all.
-Look who's talking!

759
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:14,946
-I'm out.
-What's your problem?

760
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:17,491
-I don't want to do this.
-I told you I wanted to do this alone!

761
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:26,625
Oh, dear. They won't grow up anytime soon.

762
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:30,337
I thought you were off today.

763
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:34,216
Yes, I just wanted to take
a quick look around before I head home.

764
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,927
Don't be too harsh on them.

765
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:40,222
They argue like that because
they still have a lot of growing up to do.

766
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:44,810
Here.

767
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:50,106
Sang-tae

768
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:54,152
put one aside for you,
saying that you, of all people,

769
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:55,821
shouldn't have to buy the book.

770
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:57,948
My gosh, how sweet.

771
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:02,452
Then I guess I don't have to buy
100 copies of the book.

772
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:03,578
Right.

773
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:06,039
Open it.

774
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,550
Dear my fake, real mom.

775
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:20,470
Thank you for all the delicious meals.

776
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:22,931
I want to eat the food
that you make every day.

777
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:25,892
I really like you, Ms. Kang.

778
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:28,270
Here's a heart for you.

779
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:31,356
Six hearts.

780
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:35,068
"My fake, real mom"?
What on earth does that mean?

781
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:36,570
Well...

782
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:40,991
You're not our real mom,
but he likes you as much as her?

783
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:42,993
Something like that, I guess.

784
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,581
Oh, my. All the cooking I did for you guys
has paid off, I suppose.

785
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:52,544
Well...

786
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:57,048
May I hug you?

787
00:52:57,674 --> 00:53:00,677
Goodness, you don't have to ask.

788
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,477
Thank you.

789
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,480
I wish you all the best.

790
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:40,091
It's okay.

791
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:43,970
No one else will know except for
the people who were there today.

792
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:51,394
-I'm done. I'm out.
-Go! Leave!

793
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,897
My gosh, Ko Mun-yeong
is obviously no match for him.

794
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,607
This is funnier than  Comedy Big League.

795
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:58,360
The Emotionless Princess
versus the Box Man. Who will win?

796
00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:03,198
This might actually work to your advantage
in terms of marketing.

797
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:06,952
Do you really think so?

798
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:09,621
Yes, of course.

799
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:15,877
Gosh. You're such a bad liar, Ju-ri.

800
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:23,593
Mr. Lee.

801
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:26,805
You may fall,

802
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:30,016
but I know that you'll never give up

803
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:32,936
because you're a very strong person.

804
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:42,278
I guess I won't get to see you often

805
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,364
now that you're moving back to Seoul
to start afresh.

806
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:47,659
I am starting afresh,

807
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:50,787
but I'm not moving back to Seoul.

808
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:54,749
I got an office space in Seongjin City.

809
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:56,418
What?

810
00:54:57,168 --> 00:55:00,171
Rent is very expensive in Seoul.
Why would I move back there?

811
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:06,386
And you're here too.

812
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,678
How beautiful.

813
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:52,390
I mean, the sea.

814
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:57,812
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

815
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:01,357
-No. I'm sorry, Mun-yeong.
-Goodness.

816
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:03,193
-All right.
-I'm sorry. I apologize.

817
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:05,153
-So we're good now, right?
-Yes!

818
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,448
Gang-tae, we're sorry.

819
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:10,366
-Let go.
-Hey!

820
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:12,660
The troublemaker trio!

821
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:16,539
I have something for you guys.

822
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:26,841
Sang-tae, I'm paying you for your mural.

823
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:31,137
-Do you like it?
-Yes. My gosh!

824
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:33,348
Sir, this is too much.

825
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:35,517
Director O Ji-wang, you're...

826
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:39,979
You're like the wizard of Oji-gun.
How did you think of this?

827
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:41,856
My, I want this.

828
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,483
Don't even. It's mine.

829
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,068
It's mine, Mun-yeong. It's all mine.

830
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,362
I want a ride too!

831
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:55,120
Sir, I know you got this in return
for the mural, but it's too much.

832
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:56,788
Just the gesture is enough.

833
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:58,456
But I want to give you this.

834
00:56:58,706 --> 00:57:01,960
All three of you went through a lot
because of what happened.

835
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:04,879
I hired someone I should've never hired.

836
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:09,884
I owe you an apology for that as well,
so just accept it and let's call it even.

837
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:11,803
That will make me feel better.

838
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:15,265
But accepting this doesn’t feel right.

839
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:19,310
Then just keep your word and hang out
with me when you have some free time.

840
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:22,730
Will do.

841
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:25,984
You should

842
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:28,862
go on a long trip in that camping car.

843
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:31,489
There are many things you can learn
on the road.

844
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:37,328
But I must say, it'll be exhausting
to look after those two.

845
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:39,372
Right, but I think

846
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:42,584
it'll be fun.

847
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:48,381
I want to move
to the scariest neighborhood.

848
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,425
Come on. Let's go.

849
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:54,846
You always wanted the three of us
to go on a trip together

850
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:56,764
in a camping car.

851
00:57:58,766 --> 00:57:59,976
Isn't that why you drew this?

852
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:04,189
But we no longer need to run away
from the butterfly,

853
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:07,317
so why should we go somewhere far away
in that camping car?

854
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:09,444
I don't want to go.

855
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:13,072
No, we're not running away.

856
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:15,283
We're going on a trip.

857
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:17,619
What's the difference?

858
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:19,913
I don't want to go.

859
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:23,208
Well, when you run away,

860
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:27,670
you go to a faraway place to never return.

861
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:30,048
But a trip

862
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:33,968
is going somewhere far with
the intention of returning eventually.

863
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:38,014
Why leave
if you're going to return eventually?

864
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:39,557
I don't want to go.

865
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:42,227
Then why eat
if you're going to poop it all out anyway?

866
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:53,112
You said you've run out stories
that you want to write about.

867
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,908
We should go on a trip
so that you can find some inspiration.

868
00:58:57,492 --> 00:59:00,245
I heard writers often get ideas

869
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:02,580
for their next books while traveling.

870
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:05,875
We'll eat, sleep, and drive. On repeat.

871
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:10,380
Do you really think doing that
over and over in that small camping car

872
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,215
will help me find inspiration
out of thin air?

873
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:14,467
You don't know that

874
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:16,678
until we actually begin our trip.

875
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,097
You can try to find some inspiration

876
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:21,307
while I nurture my mind and study.

877
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:23,059
And Sang-tae will work on his drawings.

878
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,227
Great plan, right?

879
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:25,979
I'm not sure.

880
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:26,896
Hey.

881
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:30,775
You said you wanted
to go on a long trip with me.

882
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:32,860
Maybe not a long trip.

883
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:34,779
If you really want to go,
let's do a day trip.

884
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:36,447
"A day trip"? Are you kidding me?

885
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:38,908
I just want to hit the road
with no destination in mind

886
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:42,704
and keep on driving freely
without worrying about the future.

887
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:45,498
Whether it takes a month or half a year,

888
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,750
we'll keep on driving
until we want to stop--

889
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:49,127
Calm down.

890
00:59:50,044 --> 00:59:51,212
Don't get so worked up.

891
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:54,799
Try counting to three
when you can't control yourself.

892
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,427
It'll help you calm down.

893
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:08,688
I mean...

894
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:12,150
How could they do this to me?

895
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:16,779
I've been suppressing myself
all these years

896
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,656
and just enduring it all.

897
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:21,492
They obviously know that,

898
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:23,161
so how could they do this to me?

899
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,872
Unbelievable. Right, Jae-su?

900
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:26,789
Yes, you're right.

901
01:00:27,373 --> 01:00:28,541
My goodness.

902
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:31,794
I wondered why you offered
to buy us drinks.

903
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:34,088
You obviously needed someone to vent to.

904
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:37,925
Gosh, look at you sulking
over something so little.

905
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:40,678
Hey, Gang-tae. How have you been
putting up with everything all along?

906
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:44,932
They're publishing a fairy tale together

907
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:48,186
so I have been ostracized.

908
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:51,147
I've become an outcast.

909
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:54,150
But...

910
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:57,987
I didn't complain at all

911
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:00,990
and looked after them
throughout the entire process.

912
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:05,161
That's right. If it weren't
for all your help, Gang-tae...

913
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:07,747
Gosh, that book wouldn't even exist today.

914
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:09,290
-Right?
-Yes.

915
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:10,917
-Right?
-Yes, sure thing.

916
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:12,919
I mean, is that too much to ask?

917
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:14,337
Is it?

918
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:16,381
It's not like
I want to go to the Serengeti.

919
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:18,341
I can't go there
because I don't have a passport.

920
01:01:18,716 --> 01:01:20,885
You know? It's not like
I want to go to outer space...

921
01:01:21,886 --> 01:01:23,096
Honestly...

922
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:29,477
I just wanted the three of us
to go on a trip in that camping car.

923
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:32,855
Just driving through
the mountains and fields, you know?

924
01:01:33,314 --> 01:01:36,651
I said, "Let's just go with the flow
and see where it takes us."

925
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:40,321
And they can't even do that for me?

926
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:45,576
You're absolutely right! Gang-tae,
you've been putting up with so much.

927
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:49,247
Sang-tae and Ko Mun-yeong can't do that
to you. They owe you an apology!

928
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:51,040
My gosh, I'm really sorry.

929
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:55,002
Gang-tae, I sincerely apologize
on their behalf.

930
01:01:59,132 --> 01:01:59,966
Really?

931
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:03,594
Yes, of course.

932
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:05,471
Do you really think so?

933
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:06,514
No doubt.

934
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:09,100
You too?

935
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:11,978
Yes, of course.

936
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:17,525
This is all fake. It's all a lie.

937
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:18,735
It's all fake.

938
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:20,695
Gosh!

939
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:27,785
-Here.
-He's dead-drunk.

940
01:02:35,376 --> 01:02:37,879
Jeez, where have you been?

941
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:40,798
Hey, do you know what time it is now?

942
01:02:41,215 --> 01:02:44,260
What's going on? Did you drink?

943
01:02:44,343 --> 01:02:46,387
He reeks of alcohol.
He's obviously been drinking.

944
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:47,889
Hey.

945
01:02:48,389 --> 01:02:51,434
What's with the suitcases?
Are you guys going somewhere?

946
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:54,353
What do you think?
You said we should go on a long trip.

947
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:57,398
We put on an act yesterday
to surprise you when you got home.

948
01:02:57,857 --> 01:02:59,442
You got all mad at us and stormed out.

949
01:02:59,525 --> 01:03:00,610
And you even drank?

950
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:04,572
Put this on. It's our family T-shirt.

951
01:03:04,655 --> 01:03:07,241
It's so cute. Look at this.
It's super cute.

952
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:22,215
Why fool me
when you were going to come anyway?

953
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:26,719
You two, seriously...

954
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:31,265
I'll go put this on.

955
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:34,936
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

956
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:37,772
By the way, why did you drink so much?

957
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:40,775
-I don't know.
-Did you drink alone?

958
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:55,706
What the heck. Poor me.

959
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:59,335
You pestered us about this trip,

960
01:03:59,418 --> 01:04:02,672
and look at you all hungover now.
What a great way to start a trip.

961
01:04:04,924 --> 01:04:08,427
Are you okay, Gang-tae?
Do you have a headache?

962
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:10,096
Do you feel like throwing up?

963
01:04:11,055 --> 01:04:12,974
-No. I'm okay, Sang-tae.
-You're okay?

964
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:16,352
Whatever. You always say that you're okay.

965
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:17,603
You're obviously not okay now.

966
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:21,482
Ko Mun-yeong, it's not nice to get angry
at someone who's not feeling well.

967
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:23,943
Why are you getting irritated?

968
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:26,070
What? Are you lecturing me right now?

969
01:04:26,153 --> 01:04:28,406
He's the one who's in the wrong.
Why give me this bullshit?

970
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:32,702
"Bullshit"?

971
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:35,788
This is my first time hearing that word.

972
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,331
That's a swear word, right?

973
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:39,166
Did you swear at me just now?

974
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:42,295
Did you? Then I should teach you a lesson.
Get a taste of this.

975
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:44,005
-Let go!
-Get a taste of this!

976
01:04:44,088 --> 01:04:45,506
-Gosh!
-Stop swearing, will you?

977
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:47,967
He started it.
Why are you giving me this bullshit?

978
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:50,219
-Hey, you said that again!
-Jeez.

979
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:51,888
- Stop it!
- Shit!

980
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:53,556
- What? "Shit"?
- It hurts!

981
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:54,473
- "Shit"?
- Gosh!

982
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:08,362
The noodles will get soggy.
Hurry up and eat.

983
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:09,989
No, thanks.

984
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:11,073
Have some.

985
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:14,327
If you waste food, you get punished.

986
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:19,248
-Let's just share this.
-Okay, I'll split this in half.

987
01:05:25,963 --> 01:05:29,717
"Gosh, this wasn't the camping road trip
I had dreamed of."

988
01:05:31,218 --> 01:05:32,470
Are you getting a reality check?

989
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:36,432
"A reality check"? What's that?

990
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:38,434
Realizing your reality.

991
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:41,938
It's like waking up from a vain dream.

992
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:44,023
Oh, I see.

993
01:05:47,026 --> 01:05:49,987
Gosh, I need a nap.

994
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:51,530
Wake me up around dinnertime.

995
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:55,743
You need to learn some slang words.

996
01:05:55,826 --> 01:05:58,955
I am trying.
You need to learn more manners.

997
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:01,457
Do you know what "IA" means?

998
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:03,209
Yes, an iced Americano coffee.

999
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:04,460
Then what's "HA"?

1000
01:06:04,543 --> 01:06:06,128
A hot iced Americano coffee.

1001
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:09,048
-Whatever.
-"IA" is an iced Americano coffee and...

1002
01:08:25,476 --> 01:08:26,435
You're not going to bed?

1003
01:08:27,812 --> 01:08:29,063
I can't fall asleep.

1004
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:36,570
I'm sorry.

1005
01:08:39,865 --> 01:08:40,950
For what?

1006
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:42,868
For hurting you twice

1007
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:45,746
physically.

1008
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:50,209
I really hope

1009
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:56,298
you'll never be hurt again.

1010
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:07,476
And...

1011
01:09:09,061 --> 01:09:09,937
thanks.

1012
01:09:14,191 --> 01:09:15,151
For bringing me

1013
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:18,070
on this trip.

1014
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:23,993
What's gotten into you?
This is so unlike you.

1015
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:36,672
I love you,

1016
01:09:37,756 --> 01:09:38,924
Moon Gang-tae.

1017
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:44,513
I'm not

1018
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:47,183
pretending.

1019
01:09:49,143 --> 01:09:50,186
I love you for real.

1020
01:09:52,771 --> 01:09:53,856
I really mean it.

1021
01:10:49,286 --> 01:10:50,287
Sang-tae.

1022
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:52,831
Let's go to Namhae today.

1023
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:55,668
Gang-tae, Moon Gang-tae.

1024
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:56,752
Yes.

1025
01:10:57,127 --> 01:10:58,504
Are you having a good time?

1026
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:01,548
Yes, I'm having a blast.

1027
01:11:01,632 --> 01:11:04,301
Do you want to keep on driving
in the camping car?

1028
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:06,220
Yes.

1029
01:11:06,303 --> 01:11:08,055
Until... Until when?

1030
01:11:09,056 --> 01:11:12,017
Well... Until we get tired of it, I guess?

1031
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:14,561
I see.

1032
01:11:15,145 --> 01:11:18,148
Then... Then go with Mun-yeong.

1033
01:11:18,232 --> 01:11:22,152
I want... I want to go somewhere else.

1034
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:28,909
Why? Are you not enjoying the trip?

1035
01:11:28,993 --> 01:11:32,871
I am. I'm having so much fun.
I'm having a great time too,

1036
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:35,457
but I...

1037
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:39,378
I want to work.

1038
01:11:41,005 --> 01:11:42,756
I want to draw illustrations

1039
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:46,969
and make children's books.
That's more fun for me.

1040
01:11:50,097 --> 01:11:51,140
I see.

1041
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:58,522
All right, then. Let's head back home.

1042
01:11:59,106 --> 01:12:02,026
No, you can keep playing.

1043
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:05,362
I want to work.

1044
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:09,867
They said someone will be here soon
to pick me up.

1045
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:12,828
All right, let's get going.

1046
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:14,788
Ko Mun-yeong!

1047
01:12:15,789 --> 01:12:17,499
-Mun-yeong.
-Yes.

1048
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:22,046
Another children's book author is in love
with my illustrations

1049
01:12:22,129 --> 01:12:25,382
and wants to work with me.

1050
01:12:25,466 --> 01:12:29,678
They said their story
needs my illustrations.

1051
01:12:31,388 --> 01:12:33,307
-Sang-tae.
-Someone

1052
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:37,227
needs me.

1053
01:12:38,312 --> 01:12:40,022
I'm needed.

1054
01:12:42,608 --> 01:12:46,570
Sang-tae, I also need your illustrations.

1055
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:50,741
Sang-tae.

1056
01:12:55,287 --> 01:12:56,163
Will you be okay

1057
01:12:57,581 --> 01:12:58,540
without me?

1058
01:13:01,126 --> 01:13:02,002
Won't you

1059
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:05,589
need me?

1060
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:08,634
Moon Gang-tae

1061
01:13:09,676 --> 01:13:11,011
belongs to Moon Gang-tae.

1062
01:13:15,682 --> 01:13:18,394
I don't belong to Sang-tae!

1063
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:20,062
I belong to myself!

1064
01:13:20,145 --> 01:13:23,524
Moon Gang-tae belongs to Moon Gang-tae!

1065
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:26,944
Moon Gang-tae belongs to Moon Gang-tae.

1066
01:13:32,282 --> 01:13:35,911
You belong to yourself,
and I belong to myself.

1067
01:13:36,745 --> 01:13:38,539
You belong to yourself,
and I belong to myself.

1068
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:45,754
Right.

1069
01:13:48,632 --> 01:13:49,925
I belong to myself.

1070
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:54,596
I don't belong to you.

1071
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:56,765
Moon Gang-tae

1072
01:13:58,308 --> 01:13:59,435
belongs to Moon Gang-tae.

1073
01:14:03,397 --> 01:14:06,233
Moon Gang-tae belongs to Moon Gang-tae.

1074
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:07,860
Hold on.

1075
01:14:11,155 --> 01:14:11,989
Gang-tae.

1076
01:14:14,324 --> 01:14:15,617
Don't cry, Gang-tae.

1077
01:14:18,412 --> 01:14:19,413
Gang-tae.

1078
01:14:22,666 --> 01:14:25,127
Thank... Thank you.

1079
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:26,962
Gang-tae.

1080
01:14:28,213 --> 01:14:30,424
Thanks.

1081
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:33,719
Thank you, Sang-tae.

1082
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:40,350
I'm grateful

1083
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:44,313
that you're my big brother.

1084
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:53,113
Thanks.

1085
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:08,754
Moon Gang-tae belongs to Moon Gang-tae.

1086
01:15:09,421 --> 01:15:11,673
Moon Gang-tae belongs to Moon Gang-tae.

1087
01:15:17,804 --> 01:15:19,264
Hello!

1088
01:15:19,556 --> 01:15:20,849
-Hello.
-Hello.

1089
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:24,061
-I can take your bag.
-Thank you.

1090
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:26,188
All right.

1091
01:15:26,271 --> 01:15:27,397
Thank you.

1092
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:34,738
Bye!

1093
01:15:44,623 --> 01:15:46,083
Bye!

1094
01:16:03,517 --> 01:16:05,686
Bye, guys!

1095
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:08,647
Ko Mun-yeong, Moon Gang-tae!

1096
01:16:09,523 --> 01:16:10,482
Bye!

1097
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:13,277
Don't fight, guys!

1098
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:16,154
A kiss is better than a fight, okay?

1099
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:20,617
"They began a new journey

1100
01:16:20,701 --> 01:16:23,036
to find their stolen faces,

1101
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:27,416
and the evil Shadow Witch
appeared in front of them once again.

1102
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:31,003
She kidnapped the Masked Boy,

1103
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:33,714
who shed tears
on behalf of the mother fox,

1104
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:38,051
as well as the Emotionless Princess
who danced with the clown."

1105
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:42,472
"'The two of you will never be able
to find your happy faces.'

1106
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:46,351
After putting such a curse on them,
she locked them

1107
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:47,603
in a deep, dark mole tunnel.

1108
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:52,065
The Box Man found the mole tunnel
a few days later,

1109
01:16:52,524 --> 01:16:53,984
but the entrance was so narrow

1110
01:16:54,067 --> 01:16:56,028
that he couldn't go in."

1111
01:16:56,820 --> 01:17:00,407
"'What do I do?
I need to take this box off my head

1112
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:03,619
in order to go into the tunnel.'"

1113
01:17:03,702 --> 01:17:08,040
"That moment, the Masked Boy's voice
reached him from inside the tunnel."

1114
01:17:08,582 --> 01:17:11,376
"'Mister, don't worry about us.
Just run far away.

1115
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:13,420
The Shadow Witch will return soon.'"

1116
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:17,507
"However, the Box Man
mustered up the courage

1117
01:17:17,591 --> 01:17:21,511
to take the box off his head.
Then he went inside the tunnel

1118
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:24,681
and saved the Masked Boy
and the Emotionless Princess.

1119
01:17:25,932 --> 01:17:28,435
Upon getting out of the dark tunnel,
the two of them

1120
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:32,731
saw the man's face covered
with dirt and grime instead of the box

1121
01:17:32,814 --> 01:17:34,566
and burst out laughing.

1122
01:17:35,192 --> 01:17:38,070
They laughed and giggled.

1123
01:17:38,945 --> 01:17:40,864
While laughing uncontrollably,

1124
01:17:40,947 --> 01:17:44,159
the Masked Boy's mask suddenly fell off."

1125
01:17:45,869 --> 01:17:48,163
"The can surrounding
the Emotionless Princess' torso

1126
01:17:48,246 --> 01:17:50,207
also fell off and made a clanking noise."

1127
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:51,541
I like her.

1128
01:17:52,459 --> 01:17:55,253
"The Box Man, now out of his box,
said this when he saw

1129
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:57,923
the two of them finding their true faces
while laughing."

1130
01:17:58,256 --> 01:17:59,549
"Happy."

1131
01:18:02,552 --> 01:18:04,846
He's happy.

1132
01:18:05,806 --> 01:18:08,725
I'm happy.

1133
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:22,906
"What the Shadow Witch had stolen
from them

1134
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:27,369
was not their true faces

1135
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:32,332
but their courage to find happiness."

1136
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:56,440
Bye!

1137
01:18:59,943 --> 01:19:01,445
-Here.
-I got it.

1138
01:19:05,031 --> 01:19:08,076
Oh, he said we're going to have
some coffee first.

1139
01:19:10,162 --> 01:19:11,163
Gosh.

1140
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:13,290
We have coffee, right?

1141
01:19:13,373 --> 01:19:15,625
Didn't you guys have coffee earlier?

1142
01:19:17,669 --> 01:19:19,588
Where's the coffee?

1143
01:19:19,671 --> 01:19:21,006
I'll get it for you.

1144
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:25,093
Let's try that again.

1145
01:19:25,719 --> 01:19:27,053
Shut up, you stupid deer!

1146
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:30,974
Let's try again.

1147
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:44,321
Hold on.

1148
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:54,414
Enough.

1149
01:19:56,833 --> 01:19:58,376
It's a tacit rule.

1150
01:19:59,294 --> 01:20:00,128
-Do you?
-Yes.

1151
01:20:01,087 --> 01:20:01,922
I'm sorry.

1152
01:20:02,005 --> 01:20:04,382
...for breach of contract,

1153
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:06,968
a verbal agreement based on trust
is enough. It's a tacit rule.

1154
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:10,180
My goodness. How? Is he okay?

1155
01:20:13,016 --> 01:20:14,100
He's lying.

1156
01:20:17,729 --> 01:20:18,897
He's lying.

1157
01:20:19,439 --> 01:20:21,274
Mr. Lee's father is a liar.

1158
01:20:22,776 --> 01:20:23,652
He's lying.

1159
01:20:24,027 --> 01:20:25,862
Mr. Lee's father is a liar.

1160
01:20:26,905 --> 01:20:29,991
He's just like his father

1161
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:33,245
I can't pinpoint it,
but I think there's some resemblance.

1162
01:20:33,328 --> 01:20:34,329
You're wrong.

1163
01:20:34,538 --> 01:20:35,580
I'm very pretty.

1164
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:38,625
-We don't look alike at all.
-Don't lie, Ko Mun-yeong.

1165
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:43,964
Don't lie, Ko Mun-yeong.

1166
01:20:45,757 --> 01:20:47,342
I'm very pretty!

1167
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:49,511
Do you want to fight?

1168
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:50,804
You little...

1169
01:20:51,304 --> 01:20:52,138
Maybe...

1170
01:20:54,224 --> 01:20:55,517
Hold on. I'm sorry.

1171
01:20:57,894 --> 01:20:59,729
Where is she?

1172
01:21:00,397 --> 01:21:02,190
Where's Ko Mun-yeong?

1173
01:21:02,274 --> 01:21:07,279
