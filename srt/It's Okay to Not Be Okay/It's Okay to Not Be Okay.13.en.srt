1
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:25,293
I WILL COME FOR YOU SOON

2
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,338
Isn't it just too cruel?

3
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,008
Because of that damn butterfly,

4
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,512
I've had to

5
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,058
crawl and suffer all these years.

6
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,947
But how could that butterfly be

7
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,867
her mother?

8
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,504
So I hope

9
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,259
she never finds out about this.

10
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,847
I don't want Mun-yeong
to suffer like this...

11
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,308
I don't want her to be hurt.

12
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:28,857
I don't want her to ever care
about other people's feelings.

13
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,111
I hope she can just live without emotions

14
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,197
like an empty can.

15
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,328
I feel so guilty when I think

16
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:47,167
about my mom and my brother. What do I do?

17
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:17,822
We're heading out.

18
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,200
You can join us later
if you change your mind.

19
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,044
GANG-TAE

20
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:34,255
PHOTO STUDIO ADDRESS

21
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,245
Thanks to Mang-tae, which you gave me,

22
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,580
I no longer have nightmares.

23
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,668
You, Sang-tae, and Mang-tae.

24
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:58,756
I'm so happy that I now have this family.

25
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,103
I want Mang-tae back.

26
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:13,521
He's mine.

27
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,378
The lady can sit on the chair.

28
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,172
Sir, please stand next to her.

29
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,967
Great. Sir, could you stand
a little closer to her?

30
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,136
-Sure.
-Nice. That's perfect.

31
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,931
Now, look at the camera
and give me a big smile.

32
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:33,309
A big smile, please.
Eyes on the camera. Here we go!

33
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,770
-One, two--
-Oh, look!

34
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:37,438
Wait. Just a second, please.

35
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:41,901
My brother... My little brother is here.

36
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:46,823
My gosh, my brother...
That's my real brother.

37
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:26,863
I'm not

38
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:29,740
too late, right?

39
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,674
I was going to photoshop you
into the photo if you didn't come.

40
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:49,844
That's why I came.

41
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:52,722
You look dashing. So dashing.

42
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,724
How... How much was this suit?
Was it 100,000 won?

43
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,311
-You look dashing too.
-Yes, I know.

44
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,605
My gosh, you styled your hair with wax.

45
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,356
Did you... Did you use mine?

46
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,442
If all three of you
are going to be in the photo,

47
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,152
stand side by side and look at the camera.

48
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:08,946
Okay. The three of us
are taking the photo together.

49
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,408
This is our family portrait.
A family portrait.

50
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,410
Both of you,
please stand closer to the lady.

51
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:29,175
Since it's for a family portrait,
please give me a big smile.

52
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,384
Here we go.

53
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:31,969
Please smile.

54
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:33,429
Okay, here we go.

55
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,682
One, two, three!

56
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:47,360
CHAPTER 13
THE FATHER OF THE TWO SISTERS

57
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,077
I'm back.

58
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,459
-Mr. Lee, you're back.
-Oh, Seung-jae.

59
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,212
Hey, where are you going?

60
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,339
I texted you.

61
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:11,217
I'm going to the art library with Ms. Ko
and Mr. Moon Sang-tae

62
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,218
to do some research.

63
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,178
Hey, I obviously didn't see your text

64
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,888
because you told me to keep my phone off.

65
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:16,889
Gosh, that hurt.

66
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,933
Ju-ri is in her room!

67
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:27,066
I think our strategy is working.

68
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,150
Oh, really?

69
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:33,406
So until she asks you
about how the blind date went,

70
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:36,284
do not bring it up first. Never, okay?

71
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:37,535
Why not?

72
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,204
You said you lied to her
that I went on a blind date with someone

73
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,455
who looks like Song Hye-kyo.

74
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,374
Gosh, just keep your mouth shut
and do as I say.

75
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,710
-I have to head out. See you later.
-Okay.

76
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:46,877
Hey, be safe.

77
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,260
Good.

78
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,389
Ju-ri.

79
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,641
May I come in?

80
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,894
Yes.

81
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,363
I wanted to let you know
I'm back safe and sound.

82
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,825
You must be tired. Get some rest.

83
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,998
I guess today is your off day.

84
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,124
Yes.

85
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:31,589
My mother packed
some seasoned mulberry leaves

86
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:34,383
and  godeulppaegi  kimchi for me,
so I brought them.

87
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,302
If you haven't eaten yet, why don't we--

88
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,262
I've eaten. You go ahead.

89
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,015
Okay.

90
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,858
I had a blind date.

91
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:52,985
Yes, I know.

92
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,696
My gosh.
She looks so much like Song Hye-kyo,

93
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,822
who's my ideal type.

94
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,617
So we totally hit it off right away--

95
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,534
Mr. Lee.

96
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,244
I have training tomorrow,

97
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,871
so I have to study all of this today.

98
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,709
Oh, okay. I'm sorry.

99
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,837
Study hard. You can do it!

100
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,525
Darn it. Me and my mouth.

101
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,739
Gosh, I'm screwed.

102
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,919
SERIOUSLY? SONG HYE-KYO?
ARE YOU THAT EXCITED?

103
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,144
Darn it.

104
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,230
Does Ko Mun-yeong think
that she can blow people off all the time?

105
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:18,529
It's okay.

106
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,948
You should talk behind people's backs
to relieve your stress.

107
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,325
I hope you live a long, healthy life,
Seung-jae.

108
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,244
Thank you.

109
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,331
Hello, our art director,
Ms. Yoo Seung-jae.

110
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,586
You're wearing a suit today.
You look so dashing!

111
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,675
-So you wanted to come here?
-Yes, it's an art library.

112
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:41,802
There are so many picture books here.

113
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,429
-Come with me.
-Okay.

114
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:44,388
It's this way.

115
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,640
-Let's go.
-Hey.

116
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,935
-Don't wear this from now on.
-Why not?

117
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:50,978
It doesn't look good.

118
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,981
You look so much better
in your caregiver uniform.

119
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,232
Oh, really?

120
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,485
I was thinking of buying a few more.

121
00:12:58,819 --> 00:12:59,904
These suits are quite comfy.

122
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,614
It looks very uncomfortable.
Don't wear it.

123
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:02,615
Okay, I won't.

124
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:04,658
Then you shouldn't wear that either.

125
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,203
It looks very uncomfortable.

126
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:09,497
Darn it.

127
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,707
Hey! Just listen to me and don't wear it,

128
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,043
or I'll shred it to pieces! You hear me?

129
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,044
Don't wear it!

130
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,924
She had a dollhouse,

131
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:23,302
a very pretty one."

132
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:28,098
This artist is a very famous illustrator.

133
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,100
I heard children these days

134
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,936
-love this kind of illustration--
-Keep...

135
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,854
Keep the noise down
when you're at the library.

136
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,773
It's basic library etiquette, okay?

137
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,858
THE GOLDEN PLATE

138
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,529
As you know,

139
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:45,199
the stories that Ms. Ko writes
tend to be very cruel and intense.

140
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:49,245
So I think it'd be great
if you could counteract that

141
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,164
with your warmth and innocence.

142
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:57,253
Like the hazy sunlight on a spring day,
for example.

143
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,712
And... Oh, right.

144
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:02,716
Something that gives you warm fuzzies.
I'm thinking mainly pastel shades,

145
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,178
so you can neutralize
Ms. Ko's intense stories--

146
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,096
I refuse.

147
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,640
-I'm afraid I can't do that.
-What?

148
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,058
Why not?

149
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:15,020
If it's neutralized, it will be bland.
You won't taste anything.

150
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,106
Who'd eat that?

151
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,774
Even dogs wouldn't eat it.

152
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,443
He's so freaking cool.

153
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,821
THE CHEERFUL DOG

154
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,664
ONCE UPON A TIME, THERE LIVED A DOG...

155
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,211
I heard you're like the Cheerful Dog.

156
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,007
Me? Why?

157
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,926
That friend of yours.
Was his name Jae-su or Jae-mi?

158
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,636
He told me

159
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:51,724
that you never really open up to anyone

160
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,517
and that you keep everything inside.

161
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:56,812
That's how the Cheerful Dog is.

162
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,233
You two met up?

163
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:04,069
I called him over to ask him

164
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,821
if he knew why you were so upset.

165
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,534
I ordered ten boxes of pizza,
and he came in no time.

166
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,330
And?

167
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,248
What did he say?

168
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,418
He told me not to pry

169
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,922
because finding out what you're thinking
won't do me any good.

170
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,426
So I've decided to give up.

171
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,887
I'm not curious at all anymore.

172
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:35,643
Ko Mun-yeong.

173
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:44,401
I'm...

174
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,406
so sick and tired

175
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,242
of protecting

176
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,578
and looking after others.

177
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,082
I was born to look after my brother,

178
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,250
and I also needed to earn a living,

179
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,254
so I've been forcing myself to do it.

180
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,050
And?

181
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,930
I will no longer

182
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,308
think of it as work.

183
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:21,438
It'll be my goal going forward.

184
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,235
Putting my life on the line
to protect my family...

185
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,154
Come to think of it,

186
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,408
it's actually pretty cool.

187
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:37,371
I don't care who it is. I will not forgive

188
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,707
anyone who messes with my family.

189
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,710
If it's taken away from me,

190
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,838
I'll chase them down until I get it back.

191
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:51,468
I will protect my family, no matter what.

192
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,643
Am I

193
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,026
part of that family?

194
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,571
We've taken a family portrait together,

195
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:20,748
so we're a family now.

196
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,850
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

197
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,519
Don't call me ever again.

198
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,982
What makes you think you can come here?

199
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,860
Fine, then come.

200
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,945
I'll just take my own life, then.

201
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,663
If he calls again,

202
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,249
just tell him that Yoo Seon-hae died.

203
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,800
Ms. Yoo, wait.

204
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,802
Would you like to go out for a walk?

205
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,136
Who was that on the phone?

206
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,056
That man again. Ms. Yoo Seon-hae's father.

207
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,433
He has no shame.

208
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,728
I heard he sent her to a shaman when
she was a kid, saying she was possessed.

209
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,397
Even I wouldn't want to see my dad
if he did that to me.

210
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,441
They've been estranged for years.
Why care now?

211
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,111
-Ms. Sun Byeol.
-Yes, ma'am.

212
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,238
You don't know her family's full story,

213
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,531
so don't be so quick to judge.

214
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,909
Don't you think you only know
one side of the story?

215
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,578
Her parents must've had a reason.

216
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,580
Right.

217
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,716
Fine, it's all my fault.

00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,427
STICKLEY MAKES A MISTAKE!
A FROG'S GUIDE TO TRYING AGAIN

219
00:18:58,762 --> 00:18:59,763
Come in.

220
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,393
-Oh, Ms. Kang.
-Hi.

221
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,228
Oh, boy.

222
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,647
Why did you skip dinner?

223
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,691
-Oh, well...
-Why?

224
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:13,443
-Please have a seat over here.
-Thanks.

225
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,780
-Oh, boy.
-I had to take care of something.

226
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,241
I see.

227
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,994
Gosh, don't worry about it.

228
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,706
You can't fall asleep
on an empty stomach. Have some.

229
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,624
Thank you.

230
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,883
You're an adult,
but you read children's books.

231
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,178
It makes you look
so pure-hearted and cool.

232
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,973
No. It's just my job, you know.

233
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,267
-Thank you for this.
-All right, eat up.

234
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,232
My gosh, it's so good.

235
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:58,155
To tell you the truth, I was starving.

236
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,408
But I skipped dinner
as I was too embarrassed.

237
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,077
Embarrassed of what?

238
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,211
Gosh, Song Hye-kyo?

239
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:15,547
Oh, dear. Why tell such a lie?

240
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:17,966
Exactly.

241
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,637
I wanted to stitch my lips together.

242
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:24,973
My goodness.

243
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,603
Shall I give you a hint?

244
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,064
"A hint"?

245
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,484
You see, Ju-ri

246
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,780
liked her dad a lot more than me.

247
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,365
He was like her pillar.

248
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,661
But her dad passed away
when she was young,

249
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:50,499
so she's had to be
my daughter, son, and husband.

250
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,585
That's why she doesn't know
how to lean on others.

251
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:58,590
If her dad were still alive,

252
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,677
she'd think that someone's got her back

253
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,554
and say whatever she wants to say.

254
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,932
She could've dealt with less heartaches,
for sure.

255
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,728
Someone who she can

256
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:15,399
just lean on when the going gets rough.

257
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,735
Wouldn't that be enough?

258
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:23,782
Oh, right. Of course.

259
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,411
Yes, sure.

260
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,124
We're home!

261
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,544
Dooly... I want to watch Dooly.

262
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,213
-I'll leave the book in the study.
-Okay!

263
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,340
-Don't forget to hang your clothes.
-All right!

264
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,901
When we pick up our family portrait,
we should hang it over there.

265
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,612
It'll totally brighten up the room.

266
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,741
Actually,
shall I completely redecorate the house?

267
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:10,704
Your room too.
It's way too small for two guys.

268
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,541
So what? Are you saying
we should switch rooms?

269
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:15,876
No, that's not necessary.

270
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,378
You can sleep in my room.

271
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,464
-Move into my room.
-No, I don't want to.

272
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:21,423
Why not?

273
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,801
Because it used to be your parents' room.

274
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,012
So what?

275
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,103
-Ko Mun-yeong.
-Yes?

276
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:41,068
If I ask you
to live somewhere else with me,

277
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:42,444
will you come with me?

278
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:44,780
But why?

279
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,366
-Will you come with me?
-Do you have to run away again?

280
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,952
Will Sang-tae start having
those dreams again?

281
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,748
If that's the case, don't worry.

282
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:57,375
I'll tear that butterfly to shreds
and kill it for you.

283
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,629
You know that I have a knack
for catching butterflies.

284
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:10,722
That's not the reason.

285
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:18,522
Even if

286
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,233
the butterfly shows up,

287
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:26,863
do not kill it.

288
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,327
You shouldn't.

289
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,291
Why not?

290
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:45,799
What if

291
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,927
I get scared and run away again?

292
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,262
I'll have to chase you down.

293
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,597
I'll catch you and break your legs.

294
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,478
Fine. You have my word.

295
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:59,729
Let's make a pinky promise.

296
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,276
And let's seal it.

297
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:07,529
Not that.

298
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:24,004
- Jeez! Who do you think you are?
-"Jeez! Who do you think you are?

299
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,714
- Why are you all angry?
-Why are you all angry?

300
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,340
- Your teeth are worse.
-Your teeth are worse.

301
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,134
- Did I ask you to look at my teeth?
-Did I ask you to look at my teeth?

302
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:30,969
- Don't splash foam on me!
-Don't splash foam on me!"

303
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:51,781
Why are your cheeks all red?

304
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,033
What?

305
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,536
Oh, maybe it's because
I took a hot shower.

306
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,163
Are you feeling shy?

307
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:03,001
Your cheeks are red,
and your pupils are quivering.

308
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:05,503
You're avoiding my eyes
and making an awkward smile.

309
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,297
You do that when you're feeling shy.

310
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:10,800
You feel shy about something you did?

311
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:12,260
No.

312
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:17,390
Well, I guess.

313
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:18,934
Did you kiss her?

314
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,521
Yes, just a peck on the lips.

315
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:30,278
A kiss is better than a fight.

316
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,864
Don't fight. I'll scold you.

317
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,166
Then let me ask you this.

318
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,294
Who do you like more
between me and Mun-yeong?

319
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:53,843
I...

320
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,724
I like Ko Gil-dong.

321
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:03,436
This braised mackerel is too salty!
How am I supposed to eat this?

322
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:06,147
No more food for you
if you keep complaining!

323
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:07,857
Why are they fighting?

324
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:12,028
Don't talk to me when I'm watching Dooly.
It's basic etiquette.

OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

326
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,668
-You'll finish this mural soon.
-Yes.

327
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,378
Hello.

328
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:32,632
Are you... Are you okay now?
Are your ears okay?

329
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:36,177
Yes. I'm much better now, thanks to you.

330

Here. I'm returning this book to you.

331
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:44,060
This book... Isn't it good?

332
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:48,440
Yes, I liked it so much
that I memorized the entire story.

333
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:51,234
Which part... What's your favorite part?

334
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:54,696
"So don't forget any of it.

Remember it all and overcome it.

336
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,074
If you don't overcome it,

337
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:01,453
you'll always be a kid
whose soul never grows."

338
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:02,871
-My gosh.
-That part.

339
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,332
That's my favorite part.

340
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,249
"Overcome it.

341
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,376
Remember it all and overcome it."

342
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,670
"Overcome it."
That's my favorite line from the book.

343
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:13,798
Well...

344
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,760
Are you still practicing
how to draw butterflies?

345
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,178
Yes.

346
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,517
On my sketchbook. Little by little.

347
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,144
Oh, I see.

348
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:29,314
Then,

349
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:33,735
what do you think will happen first?
Butterflies flying around in your mural?

350
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:34,819
Or

351
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,031
me leaving this hospital?

352
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,241
The door.

353
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,661
That will depend on which one of us
finds the door first.

354
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:46,247
-Oh, that's right.
-Yes.

355
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:49,793
Let's find that door soon
so that we can leave together.

356
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,461
Okay.

357
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:58,385
Ms. Yoo.

358
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:03,807
Ms. Yoo Seon-hae?

359
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,817
Ms. Yoo Seon-hae is acting a bit strange.

360
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,485
She wouldn't wake up.

361
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,529
When was the last time you spoke with her?

362
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,239
Yesterday afternoon.

363
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:23,743
Don't tell me...

364
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:27,372
We should probably get ready
for that visitor soon.

365
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,583
What? Who's coming?

366
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:33,753
Mr. Kan Pil-ong had a hard time
because of that visitor last year.

367
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:38,675
I know. That visitor always picks a person
and follows him or her around.

368
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:40,635
Gosh, who is this visitor?

369
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,012
Don't tell me...

370
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,306
Is it a ghost?

371
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,353
"I"?

372
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:52,772
"I."

373
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,402
The "I" in this sentence
is probably Do Hui-jae.

374
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:02,532
So this note

375
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,368
is like the butterfly's warning.

376
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:08,621
Right.

377
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:12,000
I wonder what was written
on all these notes.

378
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:15,170
I didn't find a blank notepad
with the same design anywhere,

379
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:17,505
which means

380
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,550
she didn't write these.

381
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:24,304
She probably received them from someone.

382
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:28,558
I've always thought something's
fishy here. Was this the reason?

383
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:35,231
Then first of all,
don't trust anyone at this hospital.

384
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:37,317
Don't even trust me.

385
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:42,155
And don't leave Sang-tae
alone at the hospital for the time being.

386
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:54,083
Sang-tae.

387
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,837
Don't wait here until my shift is over.

388
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,423
-Go straight home, okay?
-Okay.

389
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,219
And always keep your phone on you.

390
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:05,845
If a stranger talks to you--

391
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:09,641
I'm not a baby.
Why are you suddenly treating me like one?

392
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,061
No reason. I was just worried--

393
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,772
I'm not a coward, okay?

394
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,566
Look... Look at this.

395
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:24,989
I've been practicing hard
to draw butterflies.

396
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:28,076
And I'll find the door
before Mr. Kan Pil-ong does.

397
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,037
I won't run away anymore. No more.

398
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,670
Then you'll protect us now?

399
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:43,049
Of course. I...
I have two younger siblings now.

400
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:44,968
I'm a big brother to you and Mun-yeong,

401
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:47,303
so I must protect you guys.
I must keep you safe.

402
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,151
Hi.

403
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:05,697
-Did you eat lunch?
-Yes, just now. What about you?

404
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:08,032
I ate with Sang-tae.

405
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,412
Hey, when you're working,

406
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:14,664
can you ask either Seung-jae or Mr. Lee
to come over

407
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:15,999
and stay with you?

408
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,544
I don't like having distractions
when I'm writing.

409
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:21,671
You locked the door, right?

410
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,173
Don't let strangers in.

411
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:27,760
This is nice.

412
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:31,347
-What's nice?
-Having someone who worries about me.

413
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:35,059
I should only do things
that will make you worry.

414
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,857
Hi, sweetie.

415
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,442
"Sweetie"?

416
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,736
Who's that bitch?

417
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,697
No one. Don't worry about it.
Just focus on your writing.

418
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,075
Damn it.

419
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,953
It sounded like a young girl.

420
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,165
Where am I?

421
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:04,130
This is OK Psychiatric Hospital,
as you know.

422
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:06,925
I'm at the hospital again.

423
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:09,677
Did I come here in an ambulance
after being beaten up again?

424
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,100
You look like someone I know.

425
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:22,982
I'm caregiver Moon Gang-tae.

426
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:28,780
I go to Seongjin Elementary School.
Grade 1, class 2, student number 13.

427
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:30,073
My name is Yoo Seon-hae.

428
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,326
If you're a first grader...
Are you eight years old?

429
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:36,746
Yes. By the way, where's the bathroom?

430
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,831
There you are.
I looked everywhere for you.

431
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:41,042
I have to pee.
I need to go to the bathroom.

432
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,294
I'll show you where it is. Let's go.

433
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,465
Oh, I know who he looks like!

434
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:49,509
He looks like Park Nam-jung.
Park Nam-jung!

435
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,260
He's handsome.

436
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,392
She has dissociative identity disorder.

437
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,935
A MENTAL DISORDER IN WHICH
A PERSON HAS MULTIPLE IDENTITIES

438
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,436
The one where you have
multiple personalities?

439
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,437
Yes.

440
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:04,399
She developed the disorder
after experiencing childhood abuse.

441
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,364
It hurts.

442
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,075
It hurts.

443
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:24,043
Back then, even when parents
hit their children,

444
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,795
everyone thought it was okay

445
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:28,006
because it was considered
as a way of disciplining kids.

446
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,716
But that's child abuse.

447
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,385
What shall we do now?

448
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:34,012
-What shall we do?
-So she developed

449
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,972
multiple personalities
as a defense mechanism,

450
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,641
but her parents believed
that she was possessed

451
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,185
and sold her off to a shaman
in their neighborhood.

452
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:43,146
Then,

453
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,898
she's not an actual shaman?

454
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:49,277
She's not psychic or possessed,
so her readings were never accurate.

455
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:53,698
Director O ended up giving her counseling
when he went to see her for a reading

456
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,658
and admitted her to the hospital.

457
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:12,425
-Byeol, please call Director O.
-Okay.

458
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,971
Sir, Mr. Ko Dae-hwan in room 203...

459
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:35,198
There are other patients in this room,

460
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:38,201
so we should move him to the padded room.

461
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,410
Yes, sir.

462
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,769
I'm home!

463
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,230
Sang-tae, come here for a second.

464
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:08,606
Okay.

465
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,862
Ko Mun-yeong, you should ask me

466
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,114
if I had a good day.

467
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,657
Don't forget that I'm your boss.

468
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:20,243
Oh, those are my sketches.

469
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:25,081
Is this the boy who has no sense of self?

470
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:26,249
Yes.

471
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:30,253
And this is the emotionless princess
who is like an empty can?

472
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:31,212
Right.

473
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:34,465
And that's the man
who's trapped inside a box.

474
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,676
What do you think? Do you like them?

475
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:39,011
No, not at all. Draw them again.

476
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:40,930
Why?

477
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:44,642
-Why must I draw them again?
-I don't like the way they look.

478
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,770
Look at them.
Their necks are twisted 180 degrees.

479
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,021
This is the back of their heads.

480
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,816
No, it's not.
You're looking at their faces.

481
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:53,693
These blue circles are their faces?

482
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,945
What about their facial features?
Are they stick figures?

483
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:57,613
There are no expressions on their faces.

484
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:01,492
The message and the characters
are the two most important elements.

485
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:03,870
Will you ruin my inspiring story
with these ugly faces--

486
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:04,787
It's hard.

487
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,793
Drawing facial expressions

488
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,171
is too hard for me.

489
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:15,840
I find it difficult.

490
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,052
You have the facial expression cards.

491
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:22,847
"Angry, irritated, happy."

492
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,516
Can't you just look at those cards
and copy them?

493
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:30,146
If I copy those,
I won't be able to call them my drawings.

494
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:33,858
I can't call them my work.

495
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,866
Then study again.

496
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,327
You're observant.

497
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:47,788
Don't just stare at your brother's face.

498
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,249
Try to observe and study
other people's faces.

499
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:54,378
Then you can make
your own facial expression cards.

500
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,591
Figure it out by next week.

501
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:13,397
-Are you done for the day?
-Yes.

502
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,316
Can we have a quick chat?

503
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,533
It's about Mr. Ko Dae-hwan.

504
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:28,329
It's likely that he'll pass away
in a few days or so.

505
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,459
I'm sure Director O will contact Ms. Ko,

506
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:35,336
but you're closer to her.

507
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:40,299
You should give her a heads-up
so that she can prepare herself mentally.

508
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:42,635
Okay, I will.

509
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:48,849
I thought he'd be able to hold out
for a bit longer. I feel so bad for him.

510
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:52,645
I'm just a nurse, and even I'm this sad.
It must be devastating for Ms. Ko.

511
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:54,730
Try to comfort her.

512
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,401
Yes, ma'am.

513
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:11,622
Wait, Ju-ri!

514
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:24,093
I noticed that you didn't take your car,

515
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:28,222
so I figured you'd be back around
this time and waited at the bus stop.

516
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,142
Did you need to
talk to me about something?

517
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:32,727
No.

518
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,146
Then why wait at the bus stop?

519
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,399
Well...

520
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,900
It's getting late.

521
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:44,613
And I noticed that a few streetlights
in front of the house are out.

522
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,533
Also, there are no neighborhood guards
in this area, you know.

523
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:49,744
And I just thought of you.

524
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,042
Well, the blind date was a lie.

525
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:00,046
But it's true that I have to go

526
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:02,340
on a blind date every month
because of my father.

527
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:06,260
My father had me late, so he's 90... No.

528
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,221
Is he 91 or 92 this year?

529
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:13,100
Anyway, he had me
when he was very old and--

530
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:16,562
Is Song Hye-kyo really your ideal type?

531
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,023
No, not at all.

532
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,318
Well, my ideal type is...

533
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:24,820
How shall I put this?

534
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:30,409
Someone who she can
just lean on when the going gets rough.

535
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:34,955
Someone who can just lean on me
when the going gets rough.

536
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:36,916
She can whine to me all she wants.

537
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:41,253
But even that will look really lovely...

538
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:43,714
If her dad were still alive...

539
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,549
...so I'll think of her as my daughter...

540
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,176
"Daughter"?

541
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:50,679
Are you a pervert?

542
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,850
No. Hear me out, Ju-ri.

543
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:59,105
I want to be there for you
like your father would have been.

544
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,482
I want to be that man...

545
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,651
Ju-ri!

546
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:15,871
Are you busy?

547
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,707
I always have time to play with you
even when I'm busy.

548
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,879
-Do you have the storyline now?
-Yes, roughly.

549
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,853
So do those three people

550
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,605
eventually find what they've lost?

551
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,319
Are you asking me
to reveal how the story ends?

552
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:50,197
No, I'm just curious.

553
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,117
I'm curious too.

554
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:58,289
The girl who called you "sweetie" earlier.

555
00:40:58,372 --> 00:40:59,457
Who was that?

556
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,253
A patient who's 13 years older than you.

557
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:10,968
I see. She has such a young voice.

558
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,512
She could recite at a fairy tale reading.

559
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,979
-Ko Mun-yeong.
-Yes?

560
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:27,026
Your father...

561
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,362
-It looks like--
-I know.

562
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,698
Director O called me.

563
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:37,244
He said I should come and see him
while he's still conscious.

564
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:41,207
It's ridiculous.

565
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,710
Are all parents automatically forgiven

566
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,962
for all the bad things they did
before they die?

567
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:50,549
"Your sins are forgiven."

568
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:55,971
Can they not take their last breath
until hearing that from their children?

569
00:41:58,474 --> 00:41:59,308
Are you sure

570
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,395
you won't regret it later on?

571
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:09,610
King Donkey Ears.

572
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:13,906
You said one must let out what's inside
to avoid heartaches.

573
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:16,867
You won't get a chance

574
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,954
to talk to your father again.

575
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:23,499
Will you really be okay?

576
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,502
I don't care.

577
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:30,172
I have nothing to regret or say to him.

578
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:44,687
There was a story

579
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,773
I absolutely hated when I was little.

580
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,571
A Tale of Two Sisters.

581
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:57,658
I hated the father in the story.

582
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:21,390
Even though his daughters
were abused by their stepmother

583
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,393
and were on the verge of death,

584
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:27,771
he turned a blind eye to all of it.

585
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:33,360
The one who neglects

586
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:38,490
and turns a blind eye to the abuse
is worse than the abuser.

587
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,081
Those two sisters

588
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,168
were practically killed by their father.

589
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:05,976
-No. I hate you, Dad.
-Gosh.

590
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:08,854
-Seon-hae!
-Sir, please calm down.

591
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:09,772
Please!

592
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:11,774
-I hate you, Dad.
-Seon-hae.

593
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:14,401
-I hate you.
-Please! Help me out just once, okay?

594
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:18,447
Please, Seon-hae! Please...

595
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,699
What the heck is going on?

596
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:31,585
Your daughter clearly said no.

597
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,338
If you continue to force her
to donate her liver to you,

598
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,715
we'll have no choice
but to call the police.

599
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:41,887
I'm Seon-hae's father.

600
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:44,473
I'm her biological father.

601
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:48,060
So what? She's not
obligated to donate her liver to you!

602
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:49,103
Jeez.

603
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,397
Sir, please help me out just this once.

604
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:55,651
I may actually die
if I don't get a liver transplant.

605
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:58,737
What were you doing when your wife
nearly beat your daughter to death?

606
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:00,697
You just turned a blind eye to it.

607
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:03,075
Your daughter needed help,
but you said she was possessed

608
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:05,369
and sold her off to a shaman.
You abandoned her!

609
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:09,415
That was because she kept talking
complete nonsense back then--

610
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:12,751
You treated her like a total stranger
for 30 years. And now this?

611
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:15,671
If you really want to live,

612
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:18,006
go kneel before your daughter, not me!

613
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,057
This hurts.

614
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,230
It hurts.

615
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:40,696
My stomach hurts too.

616
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,407
My back too.

617
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:45,617
I'm in so much pain that I can't sleep.

618
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:50,539
Have you ever asked your dad for help?

619
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:52,624
He never helped me.

620
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:55,085
He always pretends to know nothing.

621
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:06,889
Seon-hae.

622
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:17,900
Shall I kick him out
and make sure he never comes back?

623
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:19,902
Or shall I

624
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:23,113
stay by your side
and keep you safe while you say

625
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,657
everything you wanted to say to him?

626
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,414
Please keep me safe.

627
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:39,630
Seon-hae.

628
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:43,926
I hate you, Dad.

629
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:49,848
You just left

630
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:54,102
whenever Mom abused me.

631
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:59,691
I kept calling you for help.

632
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:03,445
But you just left.

633
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:07,032
You didn't protect me.

634
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:11,286
Mom may have been the person who hit me,

635
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,039
but I hate you even more.

636
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,585
I wasn't possessed.

637
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,880
But you sold me off to a shaman.

638
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:26,260
I kept waiting for you.

639
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:31,974
I waited for you to come back for me.

640
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,187
I hate you, Dad.

641
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,942
I hate you so much, Dad.

642
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:31,992
You won't get a chance
to talk to your father again.

643
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:35,829
Are you sure

644
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,498
you won't regret it later on?

645
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,004
You're annoyed.

646
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:47,215
"Darn, I'm so annoyed."

647
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,476
"Damn it."

648
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:00,437
Then how about

649
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:02,731
when you don't like someone?

650
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:05,442
"I really don't like that guy. Damn it."

651
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:23,377
Then... Then how about when you're angry?

652
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,046
"I'm so angry! Damn it."

653
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:33,679
Why... Why are they all the same?

654
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:35,263
All you do is shout.

655
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,642
I think I'll have facial paralysis

656
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:40,227
while helping you with your homework.

657
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,270
-Gosh.
-My goodness.

658
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:43,522
Come in.

659
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:50,987
Mr. Moon, I heard you asked for me.

660
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,406
Yes. Hello.

661
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:57,619
I... I have homework that's due next week.

662
00:49:57,703 --> 00:50:00,080
I need to study facial expressions
so I can draw them.

663
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:02,666
You're the art director,

664
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:04,376
-so can you help me a little?
-Don't do it.

665
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:09,423
Sure. I'd love to. What can I do for you?

666
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,508
-Come sit here.
-Okay.

667
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,009
Thank you.

668
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:22,978
Can you put on
an adorable expression for me?

669
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:25,313
-"An adorable expression"?
-Yes.

670
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:31,987
She's so cute.

671
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:34,990
This is so hard. It's weird.

672
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,785
Please... Please put on
an adorable expression for me.

673
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:45,083
Let's... Let's take a break.

674
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:47,127
-This is so hard.
-I'm sorry, Mr. Moon.

675
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:54,760
Goodbye.

676
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:55,719
Bye.

677
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:01,892
Hey.

678
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,061
Right now?

679
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:16,948
I didn't know you'd ask me
to drink with you.

680
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,410
Gang-tae is on duty tonight.

681
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:22,454
So I called you instead.

682
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:31,004
You don't seem to be in a good mood.

683
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:32,589
Is it because of your dad--

684
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:35,008
The king has donkey ears!

685
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:41,014
I called you to do this.

686
00:51:41,097 --> 00:51:42,390
I didn't want to hold it in.

687
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:47,020
Then I shouldn't get drunk today.

688
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:50,065
Ju-ri.

689
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:51,817
Yes?

690
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,026
If

691
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,404
I were born as your mom's daughter

692
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,573
and you were born as my dad's daughter,

693
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:00,075
what do you think would've happened?

694
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:04,746
Then I bet...

695
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:09,167
My mom would beat you up to death
for being rude.

696
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:13,839
You're right.

697
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:13,773
Ju-ri called earlier
saying she's going to be late.

698
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:14,900
She's drinking tonight.

699
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:16,943
She's drinking?

700
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,488
I don't think she should be out drinking.

701
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:21,448
With whom?

702
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,074
-Mun-yeong.
-My gosh.

703
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:24,534
They shouldn't be together.

704
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,077
Leave them be.

705
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:28,371
They're friends.
Let them handle it on their own.

706
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:39,090
Back when I used to cook
for construction workers,

707
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:43,094
Ju-ri brought over a friend
for the first time in her life,

708
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:44,512
and that was Mun-yeong.

709
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:48,308
She was so skinny and small.

710
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,644
But she finished a huge bowl of rice.

711
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:56,191
It felt as if it was her first time
eating a warm bowl of rice.

712
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:02,530
I'm guessing something happened
between her and her family.

713
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:06,868
I'm not quite sure.

714
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:08,703
All I know

715
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:14,250
is that she had a tough childhood.

716
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:33,728
Are you awake?

717
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:36,106
Should I get you a cup of water?

718
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:41,611
I...

719
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:46,700
did something very terrible.

720
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:50,203
But there's no one

721
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:53,540
I can ask for forgiveness.

722
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:14,644
I...

723
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:19,065
killed my wife.

724
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:23,194
You killed whom?

725
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:25,864
That woman

726
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:29,075
hummed a song

727
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:33,371
even after she killed someone.

728
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:06,654
You have glioblastoma.

729
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:10,200
It's a malignant brain tumor
which means you have

730
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:11,826
a low chance of survival.

731
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:14,579
As the tumor grows in size,

732
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:17,457
you will start having cognitive
and memory disorders.

733
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:34,933
Gosh, you seem to be in a good mood today.

734
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:38,353
Yes, I'm in a very good mood.

735
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:49,823
Last night at around 8 p.m.,
a woman in her 40s

736
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:52,200
was stabbed to death in the neck
in Oji-gun, Seongjin City,

737
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:55,578
and the police have started
investigating the case.

738
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:59,582
At the time of the incident,
the victim’s son was with her,

739
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:02,585
but due to his unstable
psychological state,

740
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:06,381
the police are finding it hard to secure
an accurate statement.

741
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:09,676
The police in Seongjin City
are assuming that the victim was murdered.

742
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:12,178
- But they haven't found any evidence...
-The new housekeeper.

743
00:57:13,054 --> 00:57:14,222
Why isn't she here today?

744
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:16,558
She can't come anymore.

745
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:24,149
She shouldn't have crossed the line.

746
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:53,094
It was you, wasn't it?

747
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:56,139
You did it, didn't you?

748
00:57:57,932 --> 00:57:59,809
Did you kill that woman?

749
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:03,396
Don't worry. No one knows.

750
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:11,905
If

751
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:14,657
I die,

752
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:16,951
Mun-yeong,

753
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:19,120
my daughter,

754
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:23,082
will become a monster like you.

755
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,127
So please...

756
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:52,529
Die, you monster!

757
00:58:59,827 --> 00:59:00,703
I'm sure

758
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:05,375
I killed her that day.

759
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:37,824
Ms. Park, is there something--

760
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:39,450
No, everything's fine.

761
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:42,370
Mun-yeong...

762
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:46,749
Mun-yeong

763
00:59:48,209 --> 00:59:49,043
saw

764
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,879
everything.

765
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:56,801
She was there...

766
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:05,268
when I killed that woman.

767
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:08,271
She was just a little girl,

768
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:11,899
but she saw everything.

769
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:39,946
Dad.

770
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:41,614
Where were you?

771
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:43,032
Oh, I...

772
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:46,202
I couldn't sleep.

773
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:49,872
So I went fishing at the reservoir.

774
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:17,692
Mun-yeong

775
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:20,403
knows everything.

776
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:29,537
Is that why

777
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:34,834
you also tried to kill your daughter?

778
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:36,919
No.

779
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:40,673
I was just scared

780
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:44,177
that Mun-yeong

781
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:48,723
might also turn out to be a monster
like her mother.

782
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,768
That's why I did that.

783
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:54,395
My daughter

784
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:57,315
did nothing wrong.

785
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:02,779
I'm the one to blame.

786
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:24,675
I was

787
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:27,678
really scared of my mom.

788
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:32,391
So I always tried to be a good daughter.

789
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:36,062
I didn't want my mom to hate me.

790
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:42,068
No one came to rescue me.

791
01:03:47,448 --> 01:03:48,991
Except for one person.

792
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:54,288
I wanted to run away with him.

793
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:59,335
But I couldn't because of my mom.

794
01:04:03,464 --> 01:04:04,882
What about your dad?

795
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:07,426
Wasn't he there for you?

796
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:12,265
While my mom raised me her own way,

797
01:04:15,142 --> 01:04:16,894
the only thing my dad did for me

798
01:04:19,146 --> 01:04:20,314
was read me

799
01:04:24,485 --> 01:04:26,279
a fairy tale book just once.

800
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:30,783
"A fairy tale book"?

801
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:39,125
But Ju-ri.

802
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:46,048
He may have only done it just once,

803
01:04:48,926 --> 01:04:50,511
but I can't ever forget that.

804
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:20,875
I have to say,
with all the stuff she's been through,

805
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:23,711
Ms. Ko grew up pretty well.

806
01:07:18,826 --> 01:07:20,995
PADDED ROOM

807
01:07:40,598 --> 01:07:42,808
KO DAE-HWAN

808
01:07:55,654 --> 01:07:57,239
Stop staring at me.

809
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:01,077
Is that your sad face?

810
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:02,620
No.

811
01:08:03,537 --> 01:08:04,663
It's my pretty face.

812
01:08:06,457 --> 01:08:08,834
You shouldn't be embarrassed
about being sad.

813
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:10,419
I'm not sad.

814
01:08:10,544 --> 01:08:12,797
No, I think you're lying.

815
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:14,215
Sang-tae.

816
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:17,676
I can tell she's lying.

817
01:08:24,308 --> 01:08:25,142
Shall we go?

818
01:08:49,416 --> 01:08:52,503
KO DAE-HWAN

819
01:08:56,924 --> 01:08:58,092
I'm hungry.

820
01:08:58,884 --> 01:09:01,387
-Should we eat something?
-I want  jjamppong .

821
01:09:01,762 --> 01:09:02,805
No.

822
01:09:02,888 --> 01:09:05,391
I want rice with Gang-tae's homemade
soy sauce braised quail eggs.

823
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:08,060
Ms. Kang made them.

824
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:10,271
Ms. Kang makes the best
soy sauce braised quail eggs.

825
01:09:10,354 --> 01:09:12,481
And Gang-tae makes really good stew.

826
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:14,483
But his side dishes...

827
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:16,569
They don't taste good.

828
01:09:26,036 --> 01:09:28,038
"In a castle deep inside the forest,

829
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:30,624
a beautiful princess was born.

830
01:09:32,918 --> 01:09:34,503
The king loved his daughter very much,

831
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:38,424
so he held a party
to celebrate the birth of his daughter

832
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:41,218
and invited 12 wizards."

833
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:44,430
That means I'm also a princess.

834
01:09:45,764 --> 01:09:48,017
I live in a castle deep inside the forest.

835
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:49,393
Of course.

836
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:51,854
I built this huge castle

837
01:09:52,104 --> 01:09:55,649
so my daughter could be a princess.

838
01:10:10,956 --> 01:10:11,790
Let's see.

839
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:17,338
"The entire country was busy celebrating
the birth of the princess.

840
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:20,299
But the evil wizard who didn't get invited

841
01:10:20,799 --> 01:10:24,553
got extremely angry,
so she went straight to the castle

842
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:27,389
to ruin the birthday party."

843
01:10:42,863 --> 01:10:43,864
Well,

844
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:47,284
I know he died due to an illness,

845
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:49,411
but he still lived a long life.

846
01:10:51,997 --> 01:10:53,123
So it's not that bad, right?

847
01:10:53,707 --> 01:10:55,709
That's nonsense.

848
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:58,796
Every person's death is sad.

849
01:10:59,296 --> 01:11:00,130
Goodness.

850
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:01,882
But I have to say,

851
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:05,261
I'm relieved to know that Mun-yeong

852
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:07,972
has those two brothers to rely on.

853
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:09,598
My goodness.

854
01:11:10,307 --> 01:11:13,435
Everyone at the hospital
is going to be a bit down for a while.

855
01:11:14,019 --> 01:11:16,772
Since he's been a patient there
for the longest,

856
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:19,149
so I'm sure people are a bit depressed.

857
01:11:26,323 --> 01:11:27,491
Hey, Gang-tae.

858
01:11:29,159 --> 01:11:31,996
Yes, sure. You can come and take some.

859
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:41,714
I know I shouldn't say this to someone
who just came back from a funeral.

860
01:11:42,381 --> 01:11:46,218
But you're like an annoying daughter
who's here to take food for your husband

861
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:48,012
from your mother's house.

862
01:11:51,682 --> 01:11:52,766
There we go.

863
01:11:54,351 --> 01:11:55,436
Are you okay?

864
01:11:57,187 --> 01:11:58,939
-Me?
-Yes.

865
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:01,191
For some strange reason,

866
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:04,153
I keep wanting to ask you that
every time I see you.

867
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:07,114
I'm okay.

868
01:12:10,117 --> 01:12:11,327
I'll be okay.

869
01:12:13,245 --> 01:12:14,246
But I don't know

870
01:12:15,539 --> 01:12:17,666
if my mom is okay with the fact
that I'm trying so hard

871
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:20,419
to be happy.

872
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:22,921
What kind of nonsense is that?

873
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:26,759
The most horrible thing you can do
to a parent is to give up on being happy

874
01:12:26,967 --> 01:12:28,927
just because you feel bad about it.

875
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:32,014
If you want to make your mother happy,

876
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:35,768
do your best to live
a happy life from now on. There.

877
01:12:36,643 --> 01:12:37,561
Here you go.

878
01:12:39,104 --> 01:12:40,189
Thank you.

879
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:42,149
We'll enjoy your food.

880
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:47,029
Didn't it come out nicely?

881
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,202
Yes.

882
01:12:53,952 --> 01:12:54,953
I like it.

883
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:56,747
Should I

884
01:12:58,248 --> 01:12:59,333
sell this house?

885
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:01,377
Why?

886
01:13:02,211 --> 01:13:03,212
I just

887
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:06,965
want to start all over again.

888
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:12,054
That sounds like an idea.

889
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:15,307
I'll sell this house

890
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:17,768
and help Mr. Lee open up
a publishing company.

891
01:13:17,851 --> 01:13:19,937
And with the money that's left,
I'll buy a camping car.

892
01:13:20,979 --> 01:13:23,857
Sang-tae will be done
once he draws a butterfly on that mural.

893
01:13:24,608 --> 01:13:27,152
So you should also quit
working at the hospital.

894
01:13:27,611 --> 01:13:30,531
Then the three of us can go on a trip

895
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:31,657
without a destination.

896
01:13:34,868 --> 01:13:37,162
Okay, let's do that.

897
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:46,255
Since you're going to spend some money,

898
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:49,883
can you buy me some nice suits,

899
01:13:50,509 --> 01:13:52,386
pay for my trip to Serengeti,

900
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:56,014
and let me stay in a hotel suite?

901
01:13:57,057 --> 01:14:00,644
How about you take care of me
for the rest of my life?

902
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:05,315
Don't try to be a gigolo.
It doesn't suit you.

903
01:14:10,154 --> 01:14:10,988
Hey.

904
01:14:12,322 --> 01:14:13,699
Be honest with me.

905
01:14:14,324 --> 01:14:15,159
About what?

906
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:18,996
What do you really want to do?

907
01:14:20,747 --> 01:14:23,083
What's your dream?

908
01:14:34,595 --> 01:14:36,054
No, never mind.

909
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:39,224
Why? Do you not have one,
or do you just not want to tell me?

910
01:14:41,268 --> 01:14:42,102
I...

911
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:46,815
want to go to school.

912
01:14:49,443 --> 01:14:50,527
Even a night school will do.

913
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:52,821
You want to go to school?

914
01:14:54,281 --> 01:14:55,199
A school...

915
01:14:56,783 --> 01:14:58,494
-No.
-Why not?

916
01:14:58,577 --> 01:15:01,330
Girls in your school will be all over you,
so I can't let you do that.

917
01:15:02,247 --> 01:15:04,833
If you must go to a school,
just take online courses.

918
01:15:09,379 --> 01:15:12,341
Then what about you?
Why did you become a fairy tale writer?

919
01:15:14,718 --> 01:15:15,594
Me?

920
01:15:16,929 --> 01:15:20,307
Because I know that world best.

921
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:24,436
I really grew up like a princess

922
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:27,231
in this castle that my dad built.

923
01:15:30,067 --> 01:15:32,110
The life of a princess

924
01:15:32,736 --> 01:15:35,364
is more difficult
than you can ever imagine.

925
01:15:38,408 --> 01:15:39,743
The ending is the only happy part.

926
01:15:40,285 --> 01:15:41,286
Darn it.

927
01:15:48,335 --> 01:15:49,253
You see,

928
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:52,798
a happy ending

929
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:54,758
is what matters most.

930
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:13,777
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

931
01:16:14,194 --> 01:16:16,363
I'm going to draw a butterfly today.

932
01:16:16,446 --> 01:16:17,823
I can do it.

933
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,658
-I'll look forward to it.
-Okay.

934
01:16:19,741 --> 01:16:21,285
I'll wait for you guys after class.

935
01:16:21,368 --> 01:16:22,452
Let's all go home together.

936
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:24,454
Okay.

937
01:16:25,289 --> 01:16:26,707
He finally drew it.

938
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,503
Hello.

939
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:33,338
Sang-tae.

940
01:16:34,339 --> 01:16:36,133
You finally found your door.
Congratulations.

941
01:16:36,216 --> 01:16:37,593
-My door?
-Yes.

942
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:41,597
-Your drawing.
-My drawing?

943
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:47,769
Hello.

944
01:16:52,566 --> 01:16:53,400
What...

945
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:57,154
No... That's...

946
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:00,240
That's...

947
01:17:01,408 --> 01:17:03,327
I... I didn't...

948
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:05,454
I didn't paint that.

949
01:17:06,538 --> 01:17:07,372
That...

950
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:12,336
That's... Oh, gosh. No...

951
01:17:12,836 --> 01:17:15,005
My... My mom...

952
01:17:17,215 --> 01:17:21,553
That butterfly was on the lady
who killed my mom.

953
01:17:21,762 --> 01:17:24,598
Butterfly! That butterfly!

954
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:28,310
That...

955
01:17:30,395 --> 01:17:31,438
That butterfly...

956
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:35,984
In ancient Greek,

957
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:39,738
the word butterfly is  psyche .

958
01:17:43,241 --> 01:17:46,036
Do you know what word comes from  psyche ?

959
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,877
Psycho.

960
01:18:04,304 --> 01:18:05,263
What do you think?

961
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,934
This butterfly is one of a kind.

962
01:18:13,313 --> 01:18:14,481
Do I look pretty?

963
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:23,657
Why...

964
01:18:24,074 --> 01:18:28,453
Why is that butterfly there?

965
01:18:31,498 --> 01:18:32,332
That butterfly...

966
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:36,253
That butterfly killed my mom.

967
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:39,339
That butterfly killed my mom.

968
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:46,638
No.

969
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:53,019
That butterfly killed my mom.

970
01:18:53,645 --> 01:18:55,731
-I didn't draw that.
-Mun-yeong.

971
01:18:55,814 --> 01:18:57,190
-That butterfly killed my mom.
-No.

972
01:19:00,193 --> 01:19:03,113
-No.
-I didn't draw that.

973
01:19:13,915 --> 01:19:14,791
It's not true, right?

974
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:19,254
Right?

975
01:19:21,047 --> 01:19:22,007
Tell me it's not true.

976
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:24,176
Mun-yeong.

977
01:19:27,345 --> 01:19:28,180
Please.

978
01:19:32,309 --> 01:19:33,435
Tell me it's not true.

979
01:19:41,318 --> 01:19:42,152
Please...

980
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:43,904
Mun-yeong.

981
01:19:44,488 --> 01:19:46,239
Tell me it's not true!

982
01:21:39,644 --> 01:21:40,478
Mun-yeong is...

983
01:21:42,063 --> 01:21:43,857
She's just Ko Mun-yeong to me.

984
01:21:45,066 --> 01:21:46,610
That mutant butterfly

985
01:21:46,693 --> 01:21:47,777
is one of a kind.

986
01:21:47,861 --> 01:21:49,362
I'm sure it was here.

987
01:21:50,864 --> 01:21:51,907
Sang-tae.

988
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:53,158
I'm scared.

989
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:57,787
I will protect you. I'm your big brother.

990
01:21:58,079 --> 01:21:59,372
I'm your guardian.

991
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:01,750
Come to me.

992
01:22:02,792 --> 01:22:03,710
Mom.

993
01:22:04,210 --> 01:22:05,921
I'm so sorry.

994
01:22:06,004 --> 01:22:07,297
-Stop the car.
-Mun-yeong.

995
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:08,465
-I said, stop!
-Mun-yeong!

996
01:22:09,132 --> 01:22:10,008
Sang-tae.

997
