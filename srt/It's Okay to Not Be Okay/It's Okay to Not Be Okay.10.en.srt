1
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:56,598
"My brother...

2
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,226
I just want my brother to die!"

3
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,770
I just want

4
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,897
my brother to die!

5
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,733
"I just want my brother to die!

6
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,651
I just want my brother to die."

7
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,737
You said that.

8
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,115
You said to Mom every day
that you wanted me to die.

9
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,743
That's why you pushed me into the river
that day.

10
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:19,996
I shouted for help.

11
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:23,583
I shouted... I kept crying for help,

12
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:24,918
but you ran away.

13
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,628
You left me alone in the water
and ran away.

14
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:30,256
You wanted me dead. Every single day...

15
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:35,094
-I bet you wanted to kill me.
-No...

16
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:36,721
Everyone.

17
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,766
Everyone!

18
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,770
He's trying to kill his older brother!

19
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,315
-No.
-Everyone!

20
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:48,316
No...

21
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,194
He's trying to kill his older brother!

22
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,073
Listen, people!

23
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,241
He is...

24
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,743
-He's trying to kill his older brother!
-No...

25
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:03,289
Everyone,
He's trying to kill his older brother!

26
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:07,210
Sang-tae. Do you know the story called
King Donkey Ears?

27
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,795
He's trying to kill his older brother!

28
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:12,966
Listen, everyone!

29
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,177
He... He's trying to...

30
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:17,720
Everyone!

31
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,890
Listen up, everyone!

32
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,143
He's trying to kill his older brother!

33
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,644
No...

34
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,729
-Everyone, listen!
-No, that's not true.

35
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,399
-My little brother tried to kill me!
-That's not true.

36
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:34,487
No, Sang-tae. That's not true.

37
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:41,077
CHAPTER 10
THE GIRL WHO CRIED WOLF

38
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:45,915
UNDER SEDATION
DO NOT DISTURB

39
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,376
Did he fall asleep?

40
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:49,711
Yes.

41
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:59,220
We gave him sedatives, and he fell asleep.

42
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,348
Why don't you let him stay here
for a while?

43
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,851
I'm not saying he should be hospitalized.

44
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,395
We'll just temporarily
take care of him here.

45
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:10,982
Okay.

46
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,823
He'll be asleep for a while.

47
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,912
You should go outside and get some air.

48
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:23,471
Hey, where are you going?

49
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,684
How far are you going to walk?

50
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:31,854
My feet hurt.

51
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,857
Gang-tae!

52
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,197
I told you not to turn your back on me!

53
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:57,964
It's your fault

54
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,092
for having such a broad back.

55
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:04,971
Aren't you hungry?

56
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,766
There's a delicious udon restaurant

57
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,810
-two train stops away from here.
-Ko Mun-yeong.

58
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,231
Stop following me.

59
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,992
But we go hand in hand.
We should be together.

60
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,455
Go home.

61
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,499
I need to be with my brother.

62
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,463
You did nothing wrong.

63
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,301
Your brother just got unlucky

64
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,053
and fell into the river that day.

65
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,932
Gang-tae! Help!

66
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,392
Gang-tae!

67
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,146
You were a coward,
but you weren't malicious.

68
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:59,442
You ran away, but in the end,

69
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,111
you came back and saved your brother.

70
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,158
You're innocent.

71
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:12,997
I ran away

72
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,210
because I really

73
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,506
wanted him to die.

74
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:25,927
Sang-tae knows that.

75
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,346
And

76
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:30,681
so did you.

77
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,811
What do you know about me?

78
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,355
Who are you to act up like this?

79
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,273
Hypocrite.

80
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,653
There's no way I'm innocent.

81
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,613
So

82
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,824
are you going to sacrifice
your entire life

83
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,535
for your brother
so you can atone for your sin?

84
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:55,832
Why did you

85
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,376
save me

86
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,672
from the river that day?

87
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,175
You should've just left me to die.

88
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,929
If I had died that day,

89
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,392
I wouldn't have had to live this way.

90
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,261
I kept calling for him.

91
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:52,805
But he left.

92
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,100
He just abandoned me.

93
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,313
He left me all alone

94
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,691
and left far away.

95
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,443
He tried to kill his brother.

96
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,695
I heard he pushed him into a river.

97
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,990
You really can't tell a book by its cover.

98
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,118
No wonder his smile

99
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,370
always seemed a bit creepy.

100
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,247
I saw it.

101
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,292
-What?
-I could tell

102
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,419
by the look in his eyes.

103
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:27,590
He's a guy who's cruel enough
to kill someone.

104
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,842
-But he's handsome.
-Ignore her. She's talking gibberish.

105
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,093
Yes, he really is.

106
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,762
So what if he's handsome?

107
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,599
You crazy shaman!

108
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,142
-Jeong-tae!
-Watch what comes out of your mouth!

109
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,238
My gosh.

110
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,206
Wipe your face.

111
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,877
Mr. Joo Jeong-tae was really good

112
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,213
at aiming people with a fire extinguisher.

113
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,799
I guess he really was a firefighter
back in the days.

114
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,009
That stuff is used to put out fire,
not people.

115
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,594
Didn't you hear what he said?

116
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,847
The stuff we said is
what caused this mess.

117
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,768
Let's be careful of what we say
from now on.

118
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,646
Let's not even talk about Mr. Moon.

119
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,024
My gosh.

120
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:30,903
-Ms. Park.
-Yes?

121
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,864
Here are Ms. Park Ok-ran's recent
counseling records that you asked for.

122
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,869
But why are you interested in her
all of a sudden?

123
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:44,542
Well, she's been experiencing
severe changes in mood lately.

124
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,544
And her affect seems
very different from usual.

125
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:47,587
AFFECT: EXPRESSION OF FEELINGS
AND EMOTION

126
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,464
I just want to see
if there's a specific cause to that.

127
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,341
COUNSELING ROOM

128
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,054
Are you getting along okay
at the hospital?

129
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,889
I have a question.

130
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,727
Go ahead.

131
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,605
Did he really try to kill him?

132
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:07,898
What?

133
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,610
Did the caregiver really try
to kill his brother?

134
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:19,076
No, I believe there was a misunderstanding
between the two.

135
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:28,628
Ms. Park.

136
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:33,049
Why do you think Othello...

137
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:35,593
killed his wife?

138
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:40,973
Because of a misunderstanding.

139
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,029
I brought your bag.

140
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,501
Sang-tae, are you sleeping?

141
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,087
Aren't you hungry?

142
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,216
This place feels really empty, doesn't it?

143
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,094
I'll move you to the ward
once there's an empty room.

144
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,805
By any chance, if you want to go home--

145
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,265
No. I don't want to go home.

146
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:27,144
Okay, you can stay here for a while.

147
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,690
Let me know if you need anything.

148
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,734
Okay?

149
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,798
My gosh, he's been out of reach all day.

150
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,466
This is driving me crazy.

151
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:00,386
I bet there's one more person
who's having a mental breakdown.

152
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,470
Do you think I should go?

153
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,264
You can't do anything to help Mun-yeong.

154
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,141
No, I was talking about Mr. Moon Sang-tae.

155
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:06,475
Hey.

156
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,145
God knows when she'll start
writing her next book

157
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,564
now that she got involved in their fight.

158
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,441
But you're worried about
the older brother?

159
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,358
Unbelievable!

160
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,653
You really care about
nothing else but money.

161
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,155
What did you just say?

162
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,824
Your parents gave you an appropriate name.

163
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,285
"Sang-in" means merchant!
You're all about the money!

164
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,414
Then I guess according to your name,
you're always out of luck.

165
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,793
My parents went to a naming center
and paid 300,000 won for my name.

166
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,713
My great-grandfather who fought for our
country's independence gave me my name!

167
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,424
Stop it, you guys.

168
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:42,261
I'm worried sick because I don't even know
if my friend is dead or alive.

169
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,180
But all you care about is selling books.

170
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,349
If Ko Mun-yeong hadn't convinced him
to go on a trip with her,

171
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,767
none of this would've happened.

172
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,189
It takes two to tango.

173
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:56,066
He went with her because he wanted to.

174
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,652
He left his brother here all by himself

175
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,696
and spent the night with Mun-yeong.

176
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,698
I bet he went with her
with an ulterior motive.

177
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,412
I really think you guys should shut up.

178
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,333
Ko Mun-yeong is the cause of all this!

179
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:17,087
Moon Gang-tae is the cunning one!

180
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,048
-Are you serious?
-Seriously?

181
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,175
-Are you kidding me?
-Look who's talking.

182
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:23,052
Oh, gosh. Did you work out?

183
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,433
Let's eat.

184
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:31,602
-Okay.
-Okay.

185
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,372
I know they have a lot on their minds.

186
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,542
But I hope they didn't skip their meals.

187
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,489
UNDER SEDATION
DO NOT DISTURB

188
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:50,890
Sang-tae.

189
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,403
Why did you save me
from the river that day?

190
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,280
You should've just left me to die.

191
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,573
That horrible jerk.

192
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,063
Why is he just sitting there
instead of going inside?

193
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:48,113
When someone has autism,
it means they shut the door to the world.

194
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,866
Gang-tae is

195
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:55,329
waiting for Sang-tae
to open that door first.

196
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,815
He's like a trapped ghost.

197
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,819
He can't approach you.

198
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,279
But he can't leave either.

199
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,282
He's just like a ghost that's trapped.

200
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,248
I bet it's really hot in there.

201
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,042
It's driving you crazy, isn't it?

202
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:45,796
Wait a minute.

203
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:50,050
How long did it take
for Crown Prince Sado to die

204
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,969
in the rice chest?

205
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,682
I can't remember if he died

206
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,393
due to hunger

207
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,064
or died due to the heat.

208
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,902
You brothers are both

209
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,696
extremely stubborn.

210
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:14,116
I'll take your brother upstairs.

211
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,994
So come out of there
and get some fresh air.

212
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,079
And go to the bathroom.

213
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:20,497
My goodness.

214
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,078
Eat this.

215
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,122
This is the best
when you don't have an appetite.

216
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,004
Have you tried a three-legged race?

217
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:13,050
You know, where each pair have their
adjacent legs bound together and run.

218
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,472
I tried it a couple of times
at my son's school sports event.

219
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,557
But I always ended up falling down first.

220
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,310
So we never got to reach the finish line.

221
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,982
It's like you and your brother
are running a three-legged race.

222
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,322
Do you think

223
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:39,618
we're both holding each other back?

224
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,245
No.

225
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,164
You're both relying on each other.

226
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:47,709
As long as one person stays strong
when the other person falls down,

227
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,753
you guys will never fall down together.

228
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,214
Try your best to stay strong.

229
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,216
Who knows?

230
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,302
Sang-tae might be the one
to help you one day.

231
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:09,690
I thought Sang-tae

232
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,654
had forgotten about everything.

233
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,159
He never once mentioned that day.

234
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,206
So I thought he had erased it
from his mind.

235
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,250
That's what you wanted to believe.

236
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:33,755
But most people with autism
have really good memory.

237
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:38,051
They either just try to avoid
their emotions

238
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,598
or express their emotions
a little differently compared to us.

239
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,351
"Avoid"?

240
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,604
You shouldn't avoid it.
Just face it head-on.

241
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,357
Come back to work.

242
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,902
Ms. Lee A-reum's ex-husband told me

243
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:58,739
he's going to drop all charges
after I blackmailed him a little.

244
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,491
I suspended you for a few days,

245
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,910
so that's more than enough.

246
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,873
-Is that really--
-I need you back because the guy

247
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:10,459
who's doing your job is terrible at it.
Maybe I should fire him.

248
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:16,506
That hurts!

249
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,133
Ms. Park! Ms. Nam!

250
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:22,346
Hey, stop. Jeong-tae.
You shouldn't bite people.

251
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,223
You're not a dog or a crocodile.

252
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,183
-My gosh, please stop.
-That's enough.

253
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,352
It really hurts! Let me go!

254
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:29,811
Mr. Moon.

255
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:36,526
Gang-tae.

256
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,279
Gang-tae.

257
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,742
He refused to take his medicine.

258
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,827
He's a patient.
He should take his medicine.

259
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,413
You can't force patients
to take their medicine.

260
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,999
He did it on purpose.

261
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,127
He lured my fingers near his mouth
so he could bite them.

262
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,130
-Why would he do that?
-I don't know.

263
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,131
He says I'm the problem.

264
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,218
He says it's because I told everyone
that you and Ms. Ko are getting married...

265
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,850
I should've stitched up your mouth,
not your hand.

266
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,068
JAE-SU

267
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,616
So this is how it feels
to love someone unrequitedly.

268
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:29,871
When you ignored my calls,

269
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,582
I was so worried
that I got extremely angry.

270
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:37,212
But now that I see you,
it's hard to be angry at you.

271
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,882
I warned you, didn't I?

272
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,343
I told you to stay away from Ko Mun-yeong.

273
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,807
I told you to constantly remind yourself
with that scar she gave you.

274
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,151
Jae-su.

275
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:04,364
I...

276
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,410
woke up from my dream.

277
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,173
I should've focused on my brother.

278
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,471
But I dared to dream an impossible dream.

279
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:34,102
I should've known my place.

280
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,486
I dreamed the impossible dream.

281
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,453
My gosh.

282
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:38,041
I brought all your favorite toppings.

283
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,753
You should eat this while it's warm.

284
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,339
It looks so delicious.

285
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,134
It smells amazing.

286
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,396
Oh, gosh.

287
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,607
I shouldn't leave the restaurant empty
for too long.

288
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:05,986
I should go back and sell a lot of pizzas.

289
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:07,946
I don't even have a part-timer.

290
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:10,782
I bet it'll feel great if I come back

291
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,701
and see an empty box.

292
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,402
KO MUN-YEONG

293
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:53,658
GANG-TAE

294
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,915
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

295
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,270
Look at you. You look so worn out.

296
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:26,608
You look like a dried jujube seed.

297
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,112
-Why are you here?
-You haven't been home in a while,

298
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,697
so I brought you your underwear.

299
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,200
Briefs, boxers, thongs, and mesh.

300
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:37,160
I don't know your taste,
so I brought everything.

301
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:38,495
Follow me.

302
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:41,790
-I need to--
-Okay, I'll take care of your report.

303
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:45,460
Bye, guys.

304
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,505
See? They're dating, right?

305
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,382
She even brought his underwear,

306
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,008
so there's no doubt about it.

307
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,050
" The Murder of the Witch of the West

308
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:35,969
by Do Hui-jae."

309
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,858
THE LITTLE BROTHER KILLS HIS BIG BROTHER

310
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,107
I thought about it,

311
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:32,817
and I think this is for the best.

312
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:36,946
It's time for you to stop playing hostage.

313
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:39,866
"Hostage"?

314
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:45,747
I don't want you to spend your entire life

315
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,040
taking care of your brother.

316
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,629
I know you want to live with me.

317
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:54,964
You want me in your arms,

318
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,175
and you want to have fun with me.

319
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,013
No.

320
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,474
Your mouth can tell lies.

321
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,352
But those eyes

322
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:09,562
cannot.

323
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,026
I...

324
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,988
woke up from my dream.

325
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,324
What?

326
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,534
It's my fault.

327
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:25,620
I...

328
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,581
should've focused on my brother.

329
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,584
He should've been my all.

330
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,546
But I was distracted by you.

331
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,175
I never should've stopped you
that day we met again.

332
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,887
I should've avoided you
when you started talking about destiny.

333
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:44,973
What we have

334
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,309
is an ill-fated relationship.

335
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:54,733
Stop putting on an act.

336
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,694
You told me I make you smile.

337
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,487
So there's no way we're ill-fated.

338
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,531
Please do me a favor.

339
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:05,577
Stay out

340
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,037
of my life.

341
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,042
You promised not to leave me.

342
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:15,003
-Was that--
-Yes.

343
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,129
It was all bullshit.

344
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,382
It was my first time having fun,
so I got too excited

345
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,718
and just said whatever.

346
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:24,471
My brother

347
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,640
is already a handful.

348
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:33,062
I'm already having a hard time
bearing with him, so please...

349
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:35,899
Please...

350
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,863
Please stop stirring up my miserable life.

351
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:44,991
And get lost.

352
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:49,662
You're lying.

353
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,583
Remember what you told me last time?

354
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,920
When I told you to get lost,

355
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,506
you told me it sounded like
I was asking you not to leave.

356
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,260
What you just said

357
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,182
sounded like you want me

358
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,226
to hold onto you.

359
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,033
Don't go.

360
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:32,539
No.

361
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:35,250
You were like

362
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,336
a firecracker to me.

363
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:40,839
A one-time event.

364
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,925
I had my fun, so it's time for you

365
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,680
to get out of my life.

366
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,375
I'm not a firecracker! I'm a bomb!

367
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,752
I don't disappear once I explode!

368
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,255
I blow up and kill everyone!

369
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,561
Then stay there until the doors open.

370
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:24,854
"Until the doors open"?

371
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,483
Am I a stone sculpture or what?

372
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:31,986
Making sure the author is well and healthy
is one of your main duties.

373
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,696
Then come here and do it yourself.

374
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,991
How dare you? I'm a busy man,

375
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,743
whereas you have nothing to do.

376
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,086
If you're going to keep treating me
like a worthless surplus,

377
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:49,587
I'd rather

378
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,799
-quit.
-Oh, gosh.

379
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:54,926
-Ju-ri.
-Hello?

380
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:57,470
Mr. Lee?

381
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,141
I hope you go bankrupt.

382
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:08,981
He already did.

383
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,867
-Heading out to work?
-Yes.

384
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,787
Let's go. I'll give you a ride.

385
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,997
No, it's only a short bus ride away.

386
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:27,875
-Just finish your breakfast.
-No, I'm done.

387
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,586
I just need to put those away.

388
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,507
I have some time
before my appointment anyway,

389
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,592
so I'll drop you off on the way.

390
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:39,804
Let me give you a ride.

391
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:47,812
Let's see what we can listen to.

392
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,275
Are you going somewhere today?

393
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:57,738
Yes, I have to go to Seoul
to attend a seminar for book publishers.

394
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,116
I need to show the industry people

395
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:02,034
that I, Lee Sang-in, am still alive.

396
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:04,162
And I thought I should
do some business as well.

397
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,543
This is a classic car, you know.

398
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:17,175
Hey, what's wrong with you today?

399
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:20,469
Why are they both going bonkers?

400
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,434
Hey.

401
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,270
-I think the heater is on.
-What?

402
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,313
The heater.

403
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,693
Jeez, is it because of the hot weather?
What is wrong with my car?

404
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,655
We'll be okay, right?

405
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:43,951
Yes, of course. It's still no problem

406
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,370
to drive the car...

407
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,630
Be safe, Ju-ri.

408
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,966
Please take good care of her, sir.

409
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,977
It was the perfect chance
to spend some one-on-one time.

410
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:14,190
My wallet. No, my wallet!

411
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:44,929
Mom?

412
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:48,057
It's the Mom.

413
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:53,271
It's Dooly's mom. A Brachiosaurus!

414
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,232
-Hi!
-Hi. My gosh!

415
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:59,235
Brachiosaurus. It's huge!

416
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:06,158
Dooly is a ceratosaurus.
He's a ceratosaurus.

417
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,702
Look, here.

418
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,412
He's a carnivore.

419
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:13,249
And Dooly's mom... Dooly's mom.

420
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:14,834
Look, right here.

421
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:17,837
Dooly's mom is a brachiosaurus,
a herbivore.

422
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,717
They have nostrils on top of the head.
It is one of their main characteristics.

423
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,718
Hang on.

424
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,679
They're mom and son.
How could they be different species?

425
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:27,596
Right.

426
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:33,477
There's a secret behind Dooly's birth.

427
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,521
-Really?
-Yes.

428
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:38,899
Dooly's mom was a stepmom.

429
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,693
I mean, fake. She was a fake mom.

430
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:45,448
Dooly's real mom lost the egg
before Dooly could hatch.

431
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:48,451
This brachiosaurus found the egg,
hatched it,

432
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,077
and raised Dooly by herself.

433
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:55,207
That's the speculation made
by the fans of the cartoon like myself.

434
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,627
So, she was a good mom
even though she was a fake mom.

435
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,463
That's right. Anything fake is bad,

436
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:03,799
but all moms are good.

437
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:07,762
Was your mom also a good person?

438
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:14,477
She was a good mom to me,
but a bad one to Gang-tae.

439
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,938
Dooly...

440
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,361
Here.

441
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:33,037
Stop staring at the food
and dig in already.

442
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,122
Okay.

443
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:36,874
Thank you for this.

444
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:47,301
They say you must be kind
to people you hate.

445
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,637
I wholeheartedly agree with that saying.

446
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,307
I hate you.

447
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,060
That's why I cooked up this feast for you.

448
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,312
You rejected my daughter,

449
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,398
and you're now head over heels
for another girl.

450
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,816
How could I not hate you?

451
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,194
"Should I tell them to move out?

452
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,948
Not seeing him around
will help her forget him and move on."

453
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:10,908
I ask myself all the time.

454
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:17,289
Would you like us to move out?

455
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:21,710
I don't think

456
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:25,297
I can sleep worry-free at night
after kicking you guys out, so no.

457
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:30,136
I'll take Sang-tae home today,

458
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:33,305
so just focus on
pulling yourself together.

459
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:41,772
Thank you.

460
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,441
You don't need to thank me.

461
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,444
If you're not going to be my son-in-law,

462
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:49,238
you should just be born as my son
in your next life.

463
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:53,909
You can be a good son all your life
and repay me then.

464
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,169
But I don't want to be born again.

465
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:05,171
Don't be so difficult.

466
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,631
Eat up, will you?

467
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:18,642
Brachiosaurus.

468
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,978
She doesn't have a teardrop.

469
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:23,481
However, I'll name her
"Teary without tears."

470
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,900
Teary without tears.

471
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,779
I'm happy. I'm so happy!

472
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,004
You'll come home today, right?

473
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:53,802
Come home for dinner.

474
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,138
And make up with Sang-tae.

475
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,767
He had a big meal, and I even saw him

476
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,769
having a lengthy conversation
with Ms. Park.

477
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,231
That means he's not angry anymore, right?

478
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:10,277
You know, there's that thing
we always say to the patients.

479
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:13,989
"If you want to make
the people around you happy,

480
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,742
you must find your own happiness first."

481
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:22,873
Being selfish isn't always a bad thing.

482
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:28,420
Try to only think about your happiness
when things are too stressful.

483
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:31,549
It's okay to do that.

484
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,061
Then,

485
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:47,690
can I

486
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:53,821
ask you for a selfish favor?

487
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,044
DOOLY THE LITTLE DINOSAUR

488
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,813
Come home at once, or I'll wipe out
all these Dooly VHS tapes.

489
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:34,361
YOU'LL BE IN BIG TROUBLE
IF YOU DON'T COME HOME

490
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:47,958
Damn it. He's ignoring me again.

491
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,719
I have a fever. I'm sick as a dog.

492
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:00,679
Pick up some fever reducer for me.

493
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:07,853
Damn it. He's still ignoring me.

494
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:17,655
I'm freaking starving...

495
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:24,286
This was here.

496
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:36,799
Sang-tae will stay with us at home
for a little while.

497
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,301
He asked me to bring his bare essentials.

498
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:41,387
"Home"?

499
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,141
So, this wasn't his "home" after all?

500
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:57,444
MALA  BEEF ON RICE

501
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:32,688
THE LITTLE BROTHER KILLS HIS BIG BROTHER

502
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:01,216
Sang-tae, I'm coming in.

503
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:51,141
Sang-tae.

504
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:55,020
Are you going to keep avoiding me?

505
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,068
Forgive me, please.

506
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:04,238
I'm sorry.

507
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:09,243
For what?

508
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:13,539
What are you sorry for?

509
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:15,457
What are you apologizing for?

510
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,385
For running away

511
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:30,722
when you fell into the water.

512
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,520
And for saying

513
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:41,525
that I wished you were dead.

514
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:44,653
That was such a mean thing to say.

515
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:50,033
Also, for wishing...

516
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:56,582
For wishing

517
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,794
that I had a normal brother
like other kids.

518
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:03,922
For wishing that often.

519
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:11,430
Just... For everything.

520
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,309
I'm sorry for everything.

521
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:19,354
I'm sorry.

522
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:23,150
Forgive me.

523
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:24,985
I'm sorry.

524
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:27,654
I...

525
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:53,639
I'm sorry.

526
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,225
Don't abandon me.

527
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:03,940
Don't leave me, Sang-tae.

528
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:08,695
I'm sorry for everything.

529
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:30,175
Don't abandon me.

530
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:35,597
I'm sorry.

531
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:42,229
Don't abandon me.

532
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:45,440
I'm sorry.

533
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:47,567
I'm really sorry.

534
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:50,612
I'm sorry...

535
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,990
Don't cry.

536
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:05,919
Don't cry.

537
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:08,505
Don't cry.

538
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:26,606
I'm leaving.

539
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:33,238
Hey, did you have dinner?

540
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:37,993
I have no food to give you,
but there's wine.

541
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:46,084
I drove here though.

542
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:48,295
So what?

543
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,426
Fine, I'll take a taxi home.

544
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:09,691
Are you no longer afraid of me?

545
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:11,651
I still am.

546
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:14,529
I'm afraid of you,

547
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:16,573
and I hate you.

548
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:22,037
I'm also jealous.

549
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,853
I'm your big brother.

550
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:49,773
That's right.

551
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,025
I'm your little brother.

552
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:53,276
You're mine.

553
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:56,363
Moon Gang-tae belongs to Moon Sang-tae.

554
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:01,368
Yes.

555
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:04,287
I'm all yours.

556
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,291
I like you.

557
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,338
We only met today,

558
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:15,757
but I like you so much.

559
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:18,760
I like you so much.

560
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:27,060
Sweet dreams.

561
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:41,199
I like you too, Sang-tae.

562
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:59,175
I see that you can drink.

563
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:08,018
Let me slap you in the face.

564
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:12,522
-What?
-I said, let me slap you in the face!

565
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:18,695
You see,

566
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:21,531
you are the biggest bitch

567
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:24,409
in the entire universe.

568
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,494
When we were little,

569
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:29,039
you harassed my friends

570
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:32,042
and made me an outcast.

571
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:36,755
Then you even stole the guy
I have feelings for.

572
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:41,843
Do you find joy
out of seeing me left all alone?

573
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:45,889
You stole the one thing I wanted,
knowing I have nothing.

574
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:49,225
Happy now? You bitch.

575
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:53,188
You obnoxious bitch.

576
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:55,607
You're so damn mean!

577
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:00,695
-You're cute.
-Yes, that's right.

578
00:54:01,237 --> 00:54:02,489
I'm so freaking cute.

579
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:06,826
When I'm this cute,

580
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:09,204
why does Gang-tae only like you?

581
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:13,291
Because I'm pretty?

582
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,006
Screw you.

583
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:25,261
You little...

584
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:52,414
One, two, three.

585
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:55,750
Smile. Don't cry.

586
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:02,799
Smile.

587
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:20,442
Ju-ri!

588
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:21,860
Mun-yeong!

589
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:27,073
Ju-ri?

590
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:30,410
-Ju-ri, wake up.
-What? Damn it.

591
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:34,873
She's just drunk, right?

592
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:36,833
Don't tell me you hit her.

593
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:38,460
I almost did,

594
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:40,628
but she passed out before I could.

595
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:43,173
How much did she drink?

596
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:48,219
She's not looking good.
I should carry her on my back.

597
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:50,513
Do you like her?

598
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:51,556
Yes.

599
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:54,142
Who do you like more? Me or her?

600
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:56,686
What's with you? You're scaring me.

601
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,938
Answer my question. Who do you like more?

602
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:02,108
Well...

603
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,861
I like you both, in different ways.

604
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:05,945
That wasn't the question.

605
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:08,615
Who comes first? And who comes second?

606
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:14,079
Mun-yeong.

607
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:17,207
When you're talking about people,

608
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:21,127
you should never number them like that.

609
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:26,174
You can cherish and care about people

610
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:28,384
in different ways.

611
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,845
Think about the different kinds of yellow,

612
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,348
such as vivid yellow,
mustard yellow, and dull yellow.

613
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:36,392
Even the same color can take
different names depending on its chroma.

614
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:38,645
The same goes for human emotions,

615
00:56:38,853 --> 00:56:40,146
such as affection.

616
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:43,775
Fondness, hatred,

617
00:56:43,983 --> 00:56:45,902
love, friendship, and lust.

618
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,988
They are like a rainbow.

619
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,617
But when they're mixed together,

620
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:54,702
they turn jet black.

621
00:56:58,706 --> 00:57:00,542
You probably got used to living
with those guys.

622
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:05,922
But how do you feel now that you're alone?

623
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:12,720
I'm just

624
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:16,391
bored.

625
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:19,894
I get sudden bouts of irritability,

626
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:23,106
and I feel colder at night.

627
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:26,734
I also get hungry more often.

628
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:31,448
There's only one way to explain
all those emotions.

629
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:33,450
Do you know what that is?

630
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:51,676
You miss him.

631
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:58,433
I miss him.

632
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:03,771
I miss him.

633
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:09,277
I miss him.

634
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:13,948
I miss him.

635
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:24,834
I miss him.

636
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:40,225
Where's my phone?

637
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:41,935
My phone.

638
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:44,771
Where did my phone go?

639
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:46,356
Gosh, where is it?

640
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:49,943
-My phone...
-Here you go.

641
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:52,028
Thanks.

642
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:57,951
Well, I hope I didn't make any mistakes
last night.

643
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:59,410
No, not at all.

644
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:04,082
You threw up twice in Mr. Lee's clunker,

645
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:05,959
but it's a great excuse to scrap the car,

646
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:07,460
so don't worry about it at all.

647
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:12,423
Want some?

648
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:02,432
Is your stomach okay?

649
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:06,769
-Pardon?
-Are you not hungover?

650
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:09,480
No.

651
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:14,068
Why are you suddenly
talking so casually to me?

652
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:15,486
What?

653
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:35,757
I can finally breathe.

654
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:38,259
-Where's Ju-ri?
-I got her.

655
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:39,844
Just get your stuff from the trunk.

656
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:50,188
All right, Ju-ri.

657
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:53,316
Come on.

658
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:56,402
Moon Gang-tae.

659
01:00:57,070 --> 01:01:00,615
Come on, Ju-ri. Let's go home.

660
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:02,992
Did she drink a lot?

661
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:05,161
You piece of...

662
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:08,414
All right. No more swearing, please.
My ears are about to rot.

663
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:14,128
You sent me there on purpose, didn't you?

664
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:18,341
So that Ko Mun-yeong and I can make up.

665
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:22,011
I bet you were worried
she'd be lonely all by herself.

666
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:24,639
Isn't that why you sent me there?

667
01:01:25,723 --> 01:01:27,558
You jerk.

668
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:30,937
Do you not know
that I have feelings for you?

669
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:33,773
Do you know or not?

670
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:37,735
Quiet down, please. You'll wake up
everyone in the neighborhood.

671
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:43,616
You said it's okay to be selfish
when things are too stressful.

672
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:51,541
Am I... Do you think I'm a pushover?

673
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:59,674
By the way, why do you keep
talking so casually to me?

674
01:01:59,757 --> 01:02:00,675
Hey!

675
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:04,178
Mun-yeong and I are friends.

676
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:05,763
Okay?

677
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:09,267
So why is it that
when you're talking to her... "Hey!"

678
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,894
You call her like that,

679
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:16,774
while you always talk so politely to me?

680
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:18,776
What the heck? You jerk!

681
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:22,029
Just talk casually to me.

682
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:25,992
Just do as I say, you jerk!

683
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:30,621
Okay.

684
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:39,964
Thanks.

685
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:51,309
Are you not feeling well?

686
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:54,312
I'm fine. I'm just tired.

687
01:03:21,255 --> 01:03:23,090
KO MUN-YEONG

688
01:03:29,013 --> 01:03:31,307
It's so hot. Can't they turn up
the air conditioner?

689
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:34,143
You're hot too, right?
You're covered in sweat.

690
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:37,230
-Yes, it's pretty hot today.
-Hold on.

691
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:44,028
Jeez, you're burning up.
You feel as hot as a heating pad.

692
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:45,780
Are you feeling under the weather?

693
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:48,032
I guess the heat got to me.

694
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:04,841
Goodness.

695
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:08,761
Look at you swearing at me nonstop
as soon as you pick up the phone.

696
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:11,222
You were obviously waiting
for someone else's call.

697
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:14,642
Mun-yeong.

698
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:18,604
I'll treat you to dinner
at a fancy restaurant today.

699
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:20,690
Let's have some beef.

700
01:04:22,483 --> 01:04:25,570
We should slice some steaks.
It's been way too long.

701
01:04:26,779 --> 01:04:28,781
"Why"? What do you think?

702
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:30,950
Today is

703
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:34,287
that day, you know. It's that day.

704
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,141
Does he like the Mom?

705
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:00,438
Dooly's mom.

706
01:05:00,646 --> 01:05:02,189
I gave it to Sang-tae as a gift.

707
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:08,154
Thank you for looking out for him.

708
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:10,156
Did you know?

709
01:05:10,948 --> 01:05:12,617
Dooly's mom was actually
not his birth mom.

710
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:19,498
Sang-tae is very selective about
who he shares that with.

711
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:23,544
Sang-tae and I have gotten quite close.

712
01:05:25,796 --> 01:05:27,131
By the way,

713
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:31,135
do you know if he's close
to Ms. Park Ok-ran, the patient?

714
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:35,640
No.

715
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:37,433
Why do you ask?

716
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:40,269
I was just curious.

717
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:45,107
Try to keep a watchful eye on her
during your shifts.

718
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:47,777
She's been quite unstable.

719
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:40,037
THE MURDER OF THE WITCH OF THE WEST

720
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:48,212
I feel as though she's intentionally
trying to provoke other patients.

721
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:53,592
That song.

722
01:06:54,635 --> 01:06:56,012
Did you just hum the song?

723
01:07:07,231 --> 01:07:08,065
Why?

724
01:07:09,316 --> 01:07:10,526
Are you going to kill me again?

725
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:18,534
Die. Just die!

726
01:07:18,617 --> 01:07:19,994
Why are you being like this?

727
01:07:20,828 --> 01:07:21,912
Help!

728
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:24,457
-Help--
-You can't fool me anymore, you monster!

729
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:26,417
-Help!
-Die.

730
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:29,003
-You monster!
-Help me!

731
01:07:29,086 --> 01:07:30,880
-Mr. Ko!
-Let go!

732
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:34,508
Let go of me! I must kill her!

733
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,677
If not, I will die!

734
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:38,637
-Please calm down.
-I said, I'll die!

735
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:39,847
Calm down, please.

736
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:43,225
-Calm down.
-I'll die if I don't kill her. I'll die!

737
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:49,190
I have to kill her!

738
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:51,859
I must kill that woman.

739
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:55,404
That day,
I should've killed Mun-yeong too.

740
01:07:56,363 --> 01:07:59,992
All monsters must be killed!

741
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:04,413
No!

742
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,793
Your daughter is not a monster.

743
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:15,841
She is not a monster.

744
01:08:17,843 --> 01:08:19,303
If you don't kill her,

745
01:08:20,387 --> 01:08:21,555
you will die.

746
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:31,774
So, you were just reading.

747
01:08:31,857 --> 01:08:34,902
Mr. Ko suddenly came up to you
and started choking you?

748
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:37,530
For no reason?

749
01:08:39,907 --> 01:08:40,991
Yes, that's right.

750
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:44,203
He called me

751
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:46,455
a monster.

752
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:48,541
A monster.

753
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:52,378
That crazy bastard.

754
01:08:54,046 --> 01:08:55,047
Shall I

755
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:57,091
just kill him?

756
01:08:58,676 --> 01:09:00,344
So, Park Ok-ran

757
01:09:00,928 --> 01:09:04,723
provoked Ko Dae-hwan
by humming "Oh My Darling, Clementine."

758
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:07,852
Then, Ko Dae-hwan

759
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:12,148
called her a monster
and tried to kill her.

760
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:15,484
You can't fool me anymore, you monster!

761
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:20,447
But the person he usually calls a monster

762
01:09:21,782 --> 01:09:23,367
is Do Hui-jae, his wife.

763
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,161
Then,

764
01:09:26,203 --> 01:09:29,165
do you think
he mistook Ms. Park Ok-ran for his wife?

765
01:09:29,456 --> 01:09:31,834
Either she knows

766
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:35,963
a lot about Do Hui-jae, or...

767
01:09:39,383 --> 01:09:42,970
Park Ok-ran could actually be Do Hui-jae.

768
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:01,697
What brings you here?

769
01:10:02,656 --> 01:10:03,741
You said

770
01:10:05,409 --> 01:10:06,869
I could come over for food.

771
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:13,334
Yes, I did. What would you like to eat?

772
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:30,935
Happy birthday.

773
01:10:31,977 --> 01:10:33,312
It's not like you just gave birth,

774
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:35,147
but you wanted to eat seaweed soup,

775
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:36,523
so it must be your birthday.

776
01:10:37,441 --> 01:10:39,151
This is my birthday gift for you, then.

777
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:42,571
Dig in.

778
01:10:54,833 --> 01:10:55,834
Do you like it?

779
01:10:58,379 --> 01:11:00,464
Well, it's not bad.

780
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:02,549
I'm glad.

781
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:10,266
Oh, boy.

782
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:31,954
Hey, leave me alone.
Gosh, what a nuisance.

783
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:34,540
Goodness, what the...

784
01:11:36,417 --> 01:11:39,336
Hey, you've been ignoring
all my calls and messages.

785
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:40,963
Why the hell

786
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:42,798
are you having dinner here?

787
01:11:42,881 --> 01:11:44,425
I said I'd buy you a steak--

788
01:11:44,508 --> 01:11:45,801
This seaweed soup has beef in it.

789
01:11:49,013 --> 01:11:51,807
Happy birthday, Ms. Ko.

790
01:11:52,057 --> 01:11:54,893
I'd like to sing a song
to celebrate Ms. Ko's birthday.

791
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:56,353
Okay, sure.

792
01:11:58,355 --> 01:12:02,401
Why were you even born?

793
01:12:02,484 --> 01:12:04,528
You ugly

794
01:12:04,611 --> 01:12:05,779
Got a death wish?

795
01:12:22,379 --> 01:12:24,506
Damn it. That's the last one.

796
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:27,468
I'll give you something
even more precious.

797
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:31,347
Surprise! I got this for your birthday.

798
01:12:32,931 --> 01:12:35,976
They said this pendant
is two hearts put together,

799
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:37,603
so I chose this in a heartbeat.

800
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:39,396
Our hearts put together.

801
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:41,273
It's perfect for us, isn't it?

802
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:43,525
You write books, and I sell them.

803
01:12:53,452 --> 01:12:55,662
My gosh, it suits you perfectly.

804
01:12:55,746 --> 01:12:58,707
Oh, my.
You're dazzlingly beautiful, Mun-yeong.

805
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:01,627
This is your way of pushing me
to get moving on my next book, isn't it?

806
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:04,671
Okay, point taken.
I should get moving if you're pushing.

807
01:13:04,755 --> 01:13:06,256
Hey, what are you talking about?

808
01:13:11,303 --> 01:13:12,388
Mun-yeong.

809
01:13:15,849 --> 01:13:16,892
Hey, why are you--

810
01:13:16,975 --> 01:13:17,935
Stay there.

811
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:25,734
Sang-tae, Moon Sang-tae! Open up, bestie.

812
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:27,611
It's me. Open the door.

813
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:34,785
No, no, I can't...

814
01:13:34,868 --> 01:13:37,162
If you don't let me in,
I'll break down the door.

815
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:42,668
No, don't.
Don't break the door. Don't do that.

816
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:45,629
I should... I should call the police.
What was the number?

817
01:13:45,712 --> 01:13:48,048
I brought a power saw. I'm not kidding.

818
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:52,428
Gosh. Dial 911 to report a fire.

819
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:53,929
Dial 111 to report a spy.

820
01:13:54,012 --> 01:13:56,765
-To report a crime...
-I can only wait three seconds.

821
01:13:56,849 --> 01:13:58,225
You'd better open up before that.

822
01:13:58,308 --> 01:13:59,560
-One.
-No...

823
01:13:59,643 --> 01:14:00,727
Two.

824
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:03,897
-Three!
-Don't break it!

825
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:05,399
Don't break down the door.

826
01:14:21,331 --> 01:14:23,250
-Here.
-Oh, Mang-tae.

827
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:26,128
Take it back.

828
01:14:26,378 --> 01:14:27,254
I'm giving him up.

829
01:14:27,838 --> 01:14:28,672
You're giving him up?

830
01:14:29,756 --> 01:14:31,300
Instead of Mang-tae,

831
01:14:31,758 --> 01:14:32,593
can I have Sang-tae?

832
01:14:34,052 --> 01:14:35,804
I want Sang-tae.

833
01:14:41,518 --> 01:14:42,769
That smile is fake.

834
01:14:42,853 --> 01:14:45,898
No, it's real.
I'm bored without you, bestie.

835
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:48,650
You're lying.

836
01:14:48,734 --> 01:14:50,235
I came to pick you up.

837
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:51,570
You're lying.

838
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:53,197
To tell you the truth,

839
01:14:54,448 --> 01:14:55,407
it's my birthday today--

840
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:57,034
You're lying. You're lying to me.

841
01:14:57,117 --> 01:14:59,286
I want you to hang out with me,
as a birthday present.

842
01:14:59,369 --> 01:15:00,621
You're lying.

843
01:15:00,704 --> 01:15:02,623
Are you a lie detector or what?

844
01:15:02,706 --> 01:15:04,249
You're lying. Stop lying to me!

845
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:06,460
You're lying!

846
01:15:06,543 --> 01:15:09,421
Liars are bad. Only bad people lie.

847
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:12,341
Liar. She told me
she was going out by herself.

848
01:15:12,424 --> 01:15:13,467
All by herself.

849
01:15:13,550 --> 01:15:15,677
Besties don't keep secrets
from each other,

850
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:18,013
but those two went somewhere fun
without me.

851
01:15:18,096 --> 01:15:20,098
I don't need this.

852
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:21,558
I don't need a camping car anymore.

853
01:15:21,642 --> 01:15:24,478
I don't need a camping car.
I don't need this anymore!

854
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:25,521
I don't need it!

855
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:56,218
Sang-tae.

856
01:15:58,095 --> 01:15:59,930
The one who's really bad

857
01:16:01,431 --> 01:16:04,226
is the person who doesn't believe
anything others say.

858
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:06,937
No, you're wrong. No.

859
01:16:08,313 --> 01:16:10,482
You know the story,
The Boy Who Cried Wolf , right?

860
01:16:11,858 --> 01:16:13,527
You don't look okay.

861
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:15,904
Why don't you get an IV drip
instead of taking medicine?

862
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:16,989
No, it's okay.

863
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:20,617
This is enough.

864
01:16:20,701 --> 01:16:23,870
The shepherd boy lied all the time.

865
01:16:26,123 --> 01:16:29,918
The boy repeatedly lied to the villagers

866
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:32,838
that a real wolf showed up.

867
01:16:35,716 --> 01:16:38,302
Do you know why the boy
tricked the villagers like that?

868
01:16:40,304 --> 01:16:42,556
Because he was bored, obviously.

869
01:16:43,056 --> 01:16:43,890
Wrong.

870
01:16:46,184 --> 01:16:47,352
Because he was lonely.

871
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:54,860
He did that because he was so lonely,
all by himself in the mountains.

872
01:17:58,799 --> 01:18:01,551
-What happened?
-Ms. Park Ok-ran smacked him in the head.

873
01:18:01,635 --> 01:18:03,345
-What?
-Well...

874
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:05,472
She said she dropped something important

875
01:18:05,555 --> 01:18:08,266
in the garden earlier
and asked me to help her find it,

876
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:09,810
so I stepped out with her and--

877
01:18:09,893 --> 01:18:12,104
She suddenly grabbed a stone
and hit him in the head.

878
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:15,440
He passed out and woke up just now.

879
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:19,486
What about Ms. Park Ok-ran?
Where is she now?

880
01:18:19,569 --> 01:18:22,572
What do we do? It looks like she escaped.

881
01:18:22,656 --> 01:18:24,574
Call the police station nearby. Hurry.

882
01:18:24,658 --> 01:18:25,742
-Come with me.
-Okay.

883
01:18:26,868 --> 01:18:28,995
Anything else? Did she say anything else?

884
01:18:29,746 --> 01:18:31,581
She said today is
a very important day for her.

885
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:34,876
I heard her mumbling about
having to meet someone today.

886
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,586
Today is a very important day to me.

887
01:18:37,337 --> 01:18:38,839
- What if
-Did you get through?

888
01:18:38,922 --> 01:18:41,341
the writer Do Hui-jae actually isn't dead?

889
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:43,218
- What if she just disappeared?
-Mr. Moon!

890
01:18:43,301 --> 01:18:45,095
- Then we know one thing for sure.
-No.

891
01:18:45,178 --> 01:18:46,805
- She'll definitely come back
-No.

892
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:48,974
to see her husband and daughter.

893
01:18:49,057 --> 01:18:50,142
No!

894
01:18:55,147 --> 01:18:56,857
The shepherd boy

895
01:18:57,941 --> 01:18:59,943
lied because he was so lonely.

896
01:19:02,195 --> 01:19:04,740
But when a wolf actually appeared,

897
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:07,784
no one came to help him.

898
01:19:10,495 --> 01:19:11,913
Had even just one person

899
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:16,293
believed him and came to help him,

900
01:19:17,502 --> 01:19:19,588
the boy wouldn't have died.

901
01:19:49,326 --> 01:19:50,202
Ko Mun-yeong.

902
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:53,830
Mun-yeong.

903
01:20:50,262 --> 01:20:51,346
I think...

904
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:54,724
I'm finally living a normal life.

905
01:20:56,601 --> 01:20:58,562
You're an adult, right?

906
01:20:58,645 --> 01:21:01,690
An adult like Ko Gil-dong,
who can accept others as a family.

907
01:21:01,773 --> 01:21:04,150
-Gang-tae is mine.
-Gang-tae belongs to Gang-tae

908
01:21:04,234 --> 01:21:06,695
You can't have Gang-tae! Never!

909
01:21:06,778 --> 01:21:09,239
She had multiple plastic surgeries.

910
01:21:09,322 --> 01:21:10,740
She's been acting weird.

911
01:21:12,951 --> 01:21:15,537
I want a big brother like you!

912
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:18,832
Gang-tae is...

913
01:21:19,332 --> 01:21:20,750
Happy.

914
01:21:21,334 --> 01:21:23,128
Gang-tae is happy.

915
01:21:26,464 --> 01:21:28,633
