1
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:59,517
I should go... Now...

2
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,111
This is so strange.

3
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,865
Ms. Ko Mun-yeong told me
to come over with you,

4
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,034
but she's not here.

5
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,328
Mun-yeong?

6
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:19,871
Mun-yeong...

7
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:24,000
I wonder if she and Gang-tae
have made up yet.

8
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,753
Have they made up...

9
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,674
This means I have to change my plan.

10
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:39,808
It'll be more fun to put both you
and Mun-yeong to sleep together.

11
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,852
I guess they kissed...

12
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:46,940
My gosh, you're so cute.

13
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,946
Don't touch it. Don't touch my hair!

14
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,656
Don't touch my hair.

15
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:57,158
Don't touch... Don't touch my hair.

16
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,536
Goodness.

17
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:03,581
What do I do...

18
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:06,835
Gosh.

19
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,594
MY BROTHER

20
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,061
SANG-TAE

21
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,272
-Sang-tae, where are you--
- Oh, Mr. Moon.

22
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,781
You're always looking for your brother.

23
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,741
Sang-tae.

24
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:40,785
Sang-tae.

25
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,288
Sang-tae.

26
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,497
Sang-tae!

27
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,376
Where can I meet you?

28
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,631
The cursed castle.

29
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:04,726
CHAPTER 15
A TALE OF TWO BROTHERS

30
00:03:58,821 --> 00:03:59,697
Sang-tae.

31
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,243
Sang-tae.

32
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,161
Sang-tae!

33
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:06,913
Sang-tae.

34
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,712
Why are you looking at me like that?

35
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,173
You look as if
you want to rip me to pieces.

36
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,300
I like that.

37
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:21,302
What did you do to Sang-tae?

38
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,890
Don't worry. I didn't kill him.

39
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,394
I gave him a tranquilizer,
so he'll wake up soon.

40
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,854
But it's too bad.

41
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,731
Mun-yeong should've been here, too.

42
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:37,235
I really wanted to see
which one of them you'd choose.

43
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,781
-Did you hide her somewhere?
-Why are you doing this?

44
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,242
Why are you doing this to us?

45
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,787
Because you ruined my daughter.

46
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,791
-What?
-She was my most perfect artwork,

47
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,043
but she's changed because of you.

48
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,129
Is your daughter...

49
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,675
an artwork to you?

50
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,638
We don't look alike at all, right?

51
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,224
I went under the knife
so I wouldn't look like her,

52
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,601
but she got those facial features from me.

53
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:15,356
That face and that body.
Her hair and even her soul.

54
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:19,902
I molded her. I created her.
She's my work of art.

55
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,949
Mun-yeong doesn't belong to you.

56
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,536
She's a person, not a piece of art.

57
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:30,413
She's a human being!

58
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,126
Damn it.

59
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:40,715
She won't listen to me because of you!

60
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,552
All failures must be discarded.

61
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,518
I don't want to do that

62
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,520
because of all the hard work I've done.

63
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,065
I'll give you a chance instead.

64
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,108
Take your brother and run far away.

65
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,028
As far away as you can go from Mun-yeong.

66
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:03,821
No.

67
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:05,990
I'll never do that.

68
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,660
I knew you'd say that.

69
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,997
Then here's another option for you.

70
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:17,877
Kill me.

71
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,548
If you kill me, you'll get your revenge.

72
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:24,592
And when Mun-yeong sees

73
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:26,719
that you killed me,
she'll get her old self back.

74
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,639
Then the two of you will never get out
of your ill-fated relationship.

75
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:31,808
So,

76
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,520
this was the ending

77
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:37,855
that you wanted?

78
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,273
Correct!

79
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:44,487
A happy ending for everyone.

80
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,035
Give it up.

81
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,079
What?

82
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,206
That messed up ending you're dreaming of

83
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:57,416
will never come.

84
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,044
-Because I will never
-Gosh.

85
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,965
give up on Mun-yeong.

86
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,555
Even though your mother died
because of Mun-yeong?

87
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,058
Do you want to hear the story?
It's very interesting.

88
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,782
This is where I met your mother
for the first time.

89
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,586
THE MURDER OF THE WITCH OF THE WEST

90
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:55,683
Excuse me.

91
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:57,727
Hello.

92
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,062
The employment agency sent me here
for the job--

93
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,190
Okay, then do the work.

94
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,650
Yes, ma'am.

95
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,694
Thank you.

96
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:42,146
Hey, what are you doing over there?

97
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:54,992
A bird with a broken wing
can't fly anyway.

98
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,661
What?

99
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,665
I should kill it, right?

100
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,938
She said since the bird can't fly anyway,

101
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,607
it'd be better just to kill it.

102
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,987
I'm proud of her.

103
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,699
Well...

104
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,994
There's this hospital
my elder son goes to.

105
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:40,830
Excuse me.

106
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,124
Yes, ma'am?

107
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,627
Thank you for your hard work.

108
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,216
Oh, okay.

109
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:40,931
Mom...

110
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,523
That's it?

111
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,235
That's why

112
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,238
you killed her?

113
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:02,953
Because of

114
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,165
what she said?

115
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,340
That's why you killed my mom?

116
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,891
She talked as if
my daughter was a lunatic.

117
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,395
How dare she.

118
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,364
Yes, kill me.

119
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,619
Don't...

120
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,331
Don't ever become weak.

121
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,260
But you know,

122
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,512
she is

123
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:05,850
still my mom.

124
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,417
Gosh, you're such a coward.

125
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,972
This is why I don't like people
who are weak.

126
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:52,980
But Mun-yeong and I
are different from you guys.

127
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:54,523
Get that?

128
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,529
Stop talking bullshit.

129
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,535
There you are.

130
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,538
Denying it is useless

131
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,791
because you and I share the same blood.

132
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:13,709
No.

133
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,297
I'm not a monster like you!

134
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,935
Even if the butterfly shows up,

135
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,145
do not kill it.

136
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,439
You shouldn't.

137
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:38,609
You

138
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,570
promised me.

139
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,074
That you wouldn't do this.

140
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,460
Hey.

141
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,046
What's wrong with you?

142
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:00,923
Wake up.

143
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,217
Moon Gang-tae.

144
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:06,345
Moon Gang-tae, wake up.

145
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,347
Moon Gang-tae!

146
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:12,726
Did you think you'd be able
to escape from me by cutting your hair?

147
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,478
Wake up.

148
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,481
Please wake up, Moon Gang-tae--

149
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,276
I told you so!

150
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:27,032
You should've listened to Mom.

151
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,702
My daughter, my baby.

152
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:31,787
My baby.

153
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,222
Don't hurt my brother and sister.

154
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,683
Don't hurt my brother and sister!

155
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:40,314
THE WORLD'S BEST FAIRY TALES

156
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,779
My gosh, thank you.

157
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,203
Goodness.

158
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:59,708
It looks like someone smacked you hard
on the head.

159
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,507
Don't get too excited. I won.

160
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,719
Those two can't be together.

161
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,972
I made sure of it.

162
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,391
We don't know that yet.

163
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,517
You're wrong.

164
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,560
Humans

165
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,438
are too weak.

166
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:27,236
That's why they suffer,
like your patients.

167
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,154
Haeng-ja.

168
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,784
People stick together
because they're weak.

169
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,836
We lean on each other like this.

170
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,923
That's what makes us human.

171
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,385
Will you ever be human?

172
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,515
Let's go.

173
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,907
What on earth did you do to Park Ok-ran?

174
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,703
Oh, that woman.

175
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,124
She was such a great actress.

176
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,433
Walk down the hallway at dawn

177
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,771
while singing "Oh My Darling, Clementine."

178
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:50,027
Visit Do Hui-jae's castle at night

179
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,946
and wish Mun-yeong a happy birthday.

180
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,702
Go to the study

181
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:01,955
and leave the envelope with the butterfly
on the desk.

182
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:20,682
THE MURDER OF THE WITCH OF THE WEST 9

183
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,434
THE MURDER OF THE WITCH OF THE WEST 9

184
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,021
Ms. Park Ok-ran.

185
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:38,617
The show's over now,
so she should leave the stage.

186
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:46,208
Maybe she's putting on a different show
elsewhere.

187
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:54,383
It's about time
you left the stage as well.

188
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,010
Please get going.

189
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:17,406
Is he really just asleep?

190
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:19,992
He'll wake up, right?

191
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:21,618
Why?

192
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,037
If he never wakes up,

193
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,665
will you take your own life
like Romeo did?

194
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:28,959
He may never wake up?

195
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,672
He fainted because he got
high doses of Ativan.

196
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,675
But I've given him some fluid,
so he'll wake up in a few hours.

197
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,051
Don't worry too much.

198
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,586
Is he okay? Is my little brother okay?

199
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:16,048
Yes. He's just asleep,
so don't worry too much.

200
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,343
The head nurse is really horrible.
She's a horrible person.

201
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:22,846
She tried to hurt my siblings
and lied to me.

202
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:25,599
She even tried to touch
the back of my head.

203
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,017
I'm glad you taught her a lesson.

204
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,937
You saved their lives, Sang-tae.

205
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,231
I'm truly proud of you.

206
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,859
I saved them. I did it.

207
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:40,864
I saved them.
That's right. I saved their lives.

208
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,251
You get hurt

209
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,713
because of me every single time.

210
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,551
I'm sorry.

211
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,015
I'm sorry.

212
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,685
Denying it is useless

213
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,437
because you and I share the same blood.

214
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,484
If you stay with me,

215
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,614
your life will be miserable.

216
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,201
I'm sorry.

217
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:52,102
-Pick up, please.
- The number you have dialed is not...

218
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:55,188
Gosh, this is driving me nuts.

219
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:59,151
Why isn't anyone picking up?
What if something terrible happened?

220
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,570
Damn it. This is driving me nuts.

221
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:06,700
Hey, you're here for questioning.
What's with this attitude?

222
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:08,076
I'm really sorry.

223
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,455
Someone I know
is in an urgent situation at the moment.

224
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,040
Please excuse me for a moment.

225
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,167
Look who's talking.

226
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,252
You can't afford
to worry about someone else now.

227
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:21,048
You crossed the centerline
and made an illegal U-turn.

228
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,424
When you were told to stop,

229
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:25,761
you kept speeding and almost hit a deer!

230
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:26,970
Gosh, seriously!

231
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:30,057
Who cares about that darn deer now?

232
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,350
Someone might die!

233
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:35,270
-Mr. Lee!
-Hey, Seung-jae.

234
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,564
What happened?

235
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:39,232
Ju-ri.

236
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,737
You made an illegal U-turn,
went over the speed limit,

237
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,615
ran away, and almost killed a deer?

238
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,367
That sounds like an NIS agent
in an intense car chase.

239
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,287
What the heck were you doing
all by yourself?

240
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,456
Jeez, it's none of your business.

241
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:56,583
Ju-ri, spare me a moment.

242
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:03,507
Are Gang-tae and Mun-yeong really okay?

243
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:04,800
Are you sure?

244
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:07,094
Yes, Jae-su called

245
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,638
and told me that they're fine.
He told me not to worry.

246
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,141
What's going on?

247
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:14,559
Ju-ri.

248
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:20,232
I think for some people, it's just
really hard to live a normal life.

249
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:26,571
It feels like some mean god's
sent all kinds of misfortune their way.

250
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,450
I feel so bad for them,
and it makes me upset

251
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,328
and furious.

252
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,333
The law of
the total number of misfortunes.

253
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:42,796
I heard we all have a set amount of
happiness and misfortune assigned to us.

254
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,924
If their lives have been filled
with misfortune up till now,

255
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,552
it means only happiness awaits them.

256
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,347
I really hope that's the case.

257
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,940
Gross, that was so cheesy.

258
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,318
I want to down a glass of soda.

259
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,697
Then when I woke up,

260
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:12,534
I saw the mean head nurse
grabbing Mun-yeong by the hair

261
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:15,328
and trying to stab Gang-tae
with the pen with her other hand--

262
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:18,373
-She tried to stab him. You got all angry
-Yes, so...

263
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:21,793
and hit her on the back of her head
with the book.

264
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,963
In conclusion, the brave Sang-tae
saved Mun-yeong and Gang-tae's lives.

265
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:27,257
I've heard the story eight times,
so I have it memorized.

266
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,719
Right. You're proud of me, right?

267
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:32,679
Are you proud of me?

268
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,474
I am, of course.

269
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:40,520
You rock. You're the best.

270
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:43,231
-You're the best.
-The best! I'm the best!

271
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:49,321
Anyhow, I ran here
because I was worried about him.

272
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:52,365
Is he Sleeping Beauty or what?
When the heck will he wake up?

273
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,618
-A kiss!
-What?

274
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:58,413
Only the prince's kiss
can wake Sleeping Beauty.

275
00:24:58,496 --> 00:24:59,623
That's right, a kiss.

276
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,127
-So from behind, I smacked...
-Smack!

277
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,113
Did you sleep well?

278
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:15,740
Yes.

279
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,120
I think I slept for too long.

280
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:22,956
I had a really long dream,

281
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,584
and it was a terrible nightmare.

282
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:35,552
It wasn't a dream.

283
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,014
Come downstairs.

284
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,308
We need to talk.

285
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,007
Now do you see?

286
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,098
It actually happened right here.

287
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,393
Just a few hours ago.

288
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:36,946
Please wake up, Moon Gang-tae. Wake up!

289
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:38,573
It's all over now.

290
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:41,826
We're alive,

291
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:43,870
and my mom...

292
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:49,918
That woman was arrested.

293
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:53,671
And the truth will be revealed soon.

294
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:00,720
Please leave.

295
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:06,559
Leave this place.

296
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,730
Like you said, I'm not an empty can.

297
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,732
I have feelings too,

298
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,486
so I will never forget

299
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:21,241
the terrible things you and Sang-tae
had to experience here because of me.

300
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,827
They'll stay with me forever.

301
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,163
And you'll probably

302
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,833
suffer emotionally every time you see me.

303
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,549
We won't forget any of it.

304
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,094
We'll overcome it.

305
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:43,555
You said that's

306
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,433
the only way we can become

307
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,018
real adults whose souls can grow.

308
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,357
We should just...

309
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,695
Let's just think of it as a nightmare.

310
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:03,742
I can do it.

311
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:09,205
Stop pretending.

312
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,751
Stop pretending like it doesn't hurt.

313
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:15,170
Stop pretending like you're okay.

314
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,921
Pretending to be okay...

315
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:20,759
You're going to do it

316
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,344
in front of me. Not just Sang-tae.

317
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,890
And seeing that masked face

318
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,310
will make me walk on eggshells around you.

319
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,854
It'll suffocate me.

320
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,482
I'll be tormented.

321
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:40,612
I don't want to live like that.

322
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,531
That's why I'm asking you to leave.

323
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,660
Move out tomorrow with Sang-tae.

324
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:58,087
Mun-yeong.

325
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,343
Do you really mean it?

326
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:08,264
Yes.

327
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,017
I just want to live alone.

328
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,061
Like I used to.

329
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:51,307
You did well, Mun-yeong.

330
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,019
You did well.

331
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,762
Why do both of you look so tired?

332
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,056
Did you not get much sleep last night?

333
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,934
-I had to think about--
-Something came up last night.

334
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,479
By any chance,

335
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:43,651
did Ms. Ko and Mr. Moon
get into a fight last night or something?

336
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:49,324
Well, you ended up
at the police station last night, Mr. Lee.

337
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,201
And Jae-su,
you closed the restaurant early

338
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,370
and ran to Ms. Ko's studio.

339
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:58,875
Doesn't that mean
something crazy happened there?

340
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,169
-Is that right?
-Is it true?

341
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,299
No, not at all.

342
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:09,052
They did get into a heated argument, but--

343
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:12,472
Right, they reconciled quickly.

344
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:17,352
Gosh. Mun-yeong not only has a bad temper,
but she's also very fussy.

345
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:20,104
She's a hard one to please.

346
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:24,359
Mr. Moon must be having a hard time.

347
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,903
Gosh, you obviously don't know him well.

348
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:29,197
He's like a nine-tailed fox.

349
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,823
He has a knack for gaining control

350
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,742
over someone by charming the person.

351
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:35,495
Tell Ms. Ko to be careful
because the fox might eat her liver.

352
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:37,246
-Sure, of course.
-Okay?

353
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,750
It sounds like the two of them
are meant to be.

354
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,210
The soup will get cold. Eat up.

355
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,419
-Okay.
-Okay.

356
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,381
I think they're lying.

357
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:08,778
Sang-tae.

358
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:12,865
Sang-tae.

359
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:17,870
Hey, are you okay?

360
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,999
Are you all right?

361
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,837
Did you... Did you get enough sleep?

362
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:30,216
What about your hand?
Has it stopped bleeding?

363
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:31,718
It doesn't hurt anymore?

364
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,053
It hurts.

365
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:37,640
It hurts so much that

366
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:39,600
I feel like I'm dying.

367
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:43,021
Oh, no. Then you need to go
to the hospital. The hospital.

368
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,529
Thank you.

369
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:54,991
Thank you for saving

370
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,076
all of us.

371
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,080
But...

372
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,000
But...

373
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,711
why did she do that?

374
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,716
The head nurse was a nice person.

375
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:14,469
Why did she do such a bad thing?

376
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,477
That woman

377
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:25,813
was a terrible person

378
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,691
who just acted nice.

379
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,235
She said

380
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:36,449
she really hated the idea
of others becoming happy.

381
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,577
The Murder of the Witch of the West .

382
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:43,039
There's a story like that in that book.

383
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:45,666
The female serial killer
who kills happy people.

384
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,502
That is the Witch of the West.

385
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,797
You read that book too?

386
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,592
Yes. Someone left the book
at the hospital, so I read it.

387
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,721
Not the whole book though.
Only up to page 63.

388
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,973
But it's so boring. It's really boring.

389
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,019
I see.

390
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,647
It's a boring book, so don't read it.

391
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:13,528
Is the head nurse
as horrible as the Witch of the West?

392
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:18,658
Yes.

393
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:23,621
But she gave me Dooly's mom as a gift.

394
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:26,666
Then,

395
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,544
what do I do with Dooly's mom now?

396
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:37,426
I'll put it in the trash on my way out.

397
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,470
Okay, throw it out.

398
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,560
No, don't throw it out.

399
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:52,733
Why not? A bad person gave it to you.
Let's just throw it out.

400
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:57,071
No, Dooly's mom didn't do anything wrong.

401
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:59,323
The person who gave it to me is bad,

402
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:02,410
but Dooly's mom isn't.

403
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:06,789
She... She didn't do anything wrong,
so don't throw her out. I won't let you.

404
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:09,834
You're right.

405
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:12,920
She didn't do anything wrong.

406
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:15,882
She's not the bad one.

407
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:21,387
I won't... I won't throw you out.

408
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:24,807
You must've been scared.

409
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:28,811
I'm sorry. I won't throw you out.
No way. I won't let it happen.

410
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,050
Are you up?

411
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,719
I made some soup,

412
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:03,804
so eat it when you get hungry.

413
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,140
I'm going to the hospital.

414
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:30,498
Sang-tae.

415
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,292
If Mun-yeong

416
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,464
wants us to move out, what will you do?

417
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,929
We're a family,
so we should live together.

418
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,975
But what if she tells us to move out?

419
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,061
We can move out.

420
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:55,147
We should take Mun-yeong with us though.

421
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:00,987
Why?

422
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:05,157
Because she'll be left alone
if the two of us move out.

423
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,742
If she's left all alone,

424
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:10,579
she'll be bored.

425
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,916
She always says that she's bored
and asks me to play with her.

426
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:20,965
But what if

427
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,343
she says that only the two of us
should move out?

428
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,516
Over my dead body.

429
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:36,480
We'll just say, "Over my dead body."
That will make us the winner.

430
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,358
Over my dead body! We're going to win.

431
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:41,319
Over my dead body. We're not moving out.

432
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:44,322
Over my dead body.
We're not going anywhere.

433
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,574
Over my dead body. We're not moving out.

434
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,534
Over my dead body!

435
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,473
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

436
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:11,891
Why?

437
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,519
Are you running away again
to a different hospital?

438
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:16,937
No.

439
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,400
I want to take it easy now.

440
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:24,487
I guess we were thinking the same thing.

441
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,615
I'm going to quit
so I can spend my time doing what I want.

442
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:30,284
Shall we hang out together?

443
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,746
I already have someone to hang out with.

444
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,832
Can you at least act like you're torn?

445
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:40,503
Are you

446
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:45,049
resigning because of what happened?

447
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:48,844
As the director, I should
take responsibility for what happened.

448
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,556
I didn't know what was going on
right under my nose,

449
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,727
so I don't think I can continue
to study the mind.

450
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,193
Then,

451
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,032
think of this as the last time.

452
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,119
Can I get a session with you?

453
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:15,955
Sure.

454
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,417
Tell me what's on your mind.

455
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:31,762
Oh, there you are.

456
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,432
You should eat something.

457
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:37,601
Gang-tae made egg soup. It's very good.

458
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:42,148
But I... I like the rice bowl more,
so that's what I had.

459
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:50,197
Oh, right. Is your head okay?

460
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:54,827
I saw that evil woman
grab you by the hair yesterday.

461
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,746
Did you lose a lot of hair?

462
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,336
She tried to hurt you
because she didn't want you to be happy.

463
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,797
She's evil. So evil.

464
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:13,345
Right, I need to show you my homework.

465
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:16,056
I practiced drawing
so many facial expressions.

466
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,600
Do you want to see it?

467
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:18,517
-Sang-tae.
-Yes?

468
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:24,482
That homework...

469
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:26,650
You don't need to do it.

470
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:29,487
What?

471
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:33,574
We won't publish the book.

472
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:38,496
What? Why... Why not?
Why won't we publish it?

473
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:39,830
Because I don't want to.

474
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:44,418
And when Gang-tae is back
from the hospital,

475
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,295
I want you guys to move out.

476
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:49,673
I'm terminating our contract.

477
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,929
If you... If you terminate the contract,

478
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,848
the penalty goes up threefold.

479
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,308
I'll pay you however much you want.

480
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:01,393
Move out before the end of the day.

481
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:05,981
Over my dead body.

482
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,693
Over my dead body. I don't care.

483
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,403
Over my dead body.
I don't care what you say.

484
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:13,614
Over my dead body!

485
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,199
Over my dead body. I'll win this fight.

486
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:18,911
No way, I'm not moving out.
Over my dead body!

487
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:32,508
To be honest,

488
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,388
I'm not sure if I can handle it.

489
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,183
Do Hui-jae...

490
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,563
The things that woman said to me,

491
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,567
her face, and the things that she did...

492
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,361
Whenever I think about those things,

493
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,364
my mom, who was killed unjustly,

494
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,742
and my brother,
who saw that while hiding...

495
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:04,873
I just can't get any of it out of my head,

496
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:10,963
and I can't breathe.

497
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:17,094
Despite that,

498
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:19,054
I lied to Mun-yeong.

499
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:23,267
I said that I could overcome all of it.

500
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:28,314
But...

501
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:34,903
Mun-yeong

502
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:37,323
won't buy it.

503
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:46,707
Being together torments you.

504
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,587
But if you break up,
it'll be equally painful.

505
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,257
If both options feel like death,

506
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,176
wouldn't it be better to suffer together?

507
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:00,179
Be honest with me.

508
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:04,099
I bet you wanted to kill Do Hui-jae
when you were alone with her.

509
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,815
Yes, kill me.

510
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,278
-Yes.
-Then why didn't you kill her?

511
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:21,200
Because

512
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,078
I thought of Mun-yeong.

513
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:29,166
Right, exactly.

514
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,919
The one that torments you

515
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:35,798
can also be the one to save you.

516
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,801
You were about to explode,

517
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:41,762
but she prevented you from blowing up.

518
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,695
What is all this?

519
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:04,743
Mun-yeong,
why on earth are you being like this?

520
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:05,828
What do you think?

521
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:07,704
I told you everything over the phone
yesterday.

522
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:09,540
I'm not going to write anymore.

523
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:14,336
Fine.

524
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:17,548
I understand it's about time
you got tired of writing fairy tales.

525
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:22,052
Then why don't we just switch
to a different genre?

526
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:28,642
Yes, let's try a genre
that better suits your personality.

527
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:32,104
What about a crime novel or a thriller?

528
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:36,066
A horror novel? A martial arts fiction
or a tragic love story?

529
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:37,943
Or...

530
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:39,445
What about an erotic novel?

531
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:40,446
I will retire.

532
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,614
I don't want to write anymore.

533
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:45,617
I'm just going to retire
and spend my time doing what I want.

534
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,371
No. Don't say that, Mun-yeong.

535
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:51,165
Gosh...

536
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:55,919
If it's because of the mental shock
from the recent incidents,

537
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:58,672
you can take about a year off and...

538
00:45:58,797 --> 00:45:59,840
Mr. Lee.

539
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,139
There are

540
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:10,517
no more stories that I want to write.

541
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,352
That's why.

542
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:15,439
And I'm going to sell this house.

543
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:18,066
So stop hovering around me.

544
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:20,694
Just go back to Seoul with Seung-jae.

545
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:22,529
You're free now.

546
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,618
No, no way.

547
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:30,037
I can't even imagine

548
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,914
SangSangESang Publishers
without Ko Mun-yeong.

549
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:33,499
And without you,

550
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,626
none of my visions will come true,

551
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:37,794
so that freedom is completely useless.

552
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:41,507
Mun-yeong, please. I'll be good to you.
Change your mind just this once.

553
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:42,925
Stop whining.

554
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,885
My head hurts
because I didn't get much sleep.

555
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:47,387
I need to get some sleep, so get lost.

556
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:03,070
I guess she's really made up her mind
to stop writing this time.

557
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:09,076
Why don't we just find a different writer
to sign with and--

558
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:12,913
Hey, do you think I'm being like this
to sell books and make money?

559
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,414
Yes.

560
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,251
Writing fairy tales

561
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:20,796
is the only way
Mun-yeong can communicate with the world.

562
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:22,881
It's the only way
she can talk and breathe.

563
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:27,970
If she doesn't want to do that anymore,
it means she's just going to die.

564
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,154
-Director O.
-Yes?

565
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:49,283
You know how you asked me
to hang out with you earlier?

566
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,952
What are you going to propose this time?

567
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:56,748
Well, I'll come by from time to time.

568
00:47:57,666 --> 00:48:00,544
So in return, can I plant a tree
in the hospital garden?

569
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:01,670
"A tree"?

570
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,297
Sure. Why not?

571
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:05,841
What kind of tree?

572
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:08,802
It could be a walnut tree or a ginkgo--

573
00:48:08,885 --> 00:48:10,804
No, don't plant a ginkgo tree. They stink.

574
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,485
I told you so!

575
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:27,404
My baby.

576
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:58,185
You seemed to be having a nightmare.

577
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:01,396
Pack up and leave.

578
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:03,106
I want you to leave today.

579
00:49:04,941 --> 00:49:06,735
I just need Mang-tae.

580
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,904
I don't need Gang-tae anymore.

581
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:11,657
Oh, right.

582
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:16,703
You already told me
you don't want anyone to rely on you.

583
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:20,499
So that's good. Now, hurry up and leave.

584
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:23,210
Are you

585
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,006
really going to live alone?

586
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:31,385
I've been living alone all my life.

587
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:35,305
People like me aren't able to live
among others.

588
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:37,182
It's better to be secluded.

589
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,352
-Why?
-Because that's how I was born.

590
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:43,772
Mun-yeong.

591
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:47,067
You can't live by yourself anymore.

592
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:49,486
Why not?

593
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,822
Because now, you know how it feels

594
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:54,199
to feel warm at heart

595
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:57,119
and to have a full stomach.

596
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:05,877
So

597
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:08,547
just admit it.

598
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:09,840
Admit what?

599
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:14,261
That you're just a little kid

600
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:16,179
who wants to be loved.

601
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:31,653
Cut the nonsense and just move out.

602
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:37,325
Do you want me to tell you a story?

603
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:38,910
No.

604
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:42,414
A long time ago...

605
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,124
Shut up.

606
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:48,545
There lived two poor brothers
who cared for each other very much.

607
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:54,885
One day, it was the harvest season,
so they both harvested rice.

608
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:58,263
The older brother was worried
his little brother might run out of rice,

609
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,975
so he secretly carried
a sack of rice at night

610
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:04,436
and left it in front of
his little brother's house.

611
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:10,025
The same day, the little brother
also carried a sack of rice

612
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:12,652
and put it in front of
his older brother's house

613
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:16,740
thinking that his older brother might
need more due to his big family.

614
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:19,242
When they woke up the next day,

615
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:23,121
they both noticed that they still had
the same amount of rice as before.

616
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:27,250
The two brothers thought it was strange.

617
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:30,253
So they did the same thing that night
and left a sack of rice

618
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:32,380
in front of each other's house.

619
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:39,638
And that continued for days.

620
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:46,186
Do you know
what the moral of this story is?

621
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:51,817
"Siblings who care a lot about each other

622
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:56,071
should live together so they won't
end up doing pointless work."

623
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:00,492
It's funny, isn't it?

624
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:03,703
What a joke.

625
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:05,580
What kind of moral is that?

626
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:09,000
My brother came up with it.

627
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:13,088
Do you not like

628
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:17,133
me and my brother?

629
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:22,013
I know you do.

630
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,016
Right?

631
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:31,147
Let's not do anything
that will waste our time.

632
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:34,442
I don't care where we live.

633
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:37,654
I just want us to live together.

634
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:40,615
Okay?

635
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:53,503
Mun-yeong.

636
00:52:58,341 --> 00:52:59,384
Answer me.

637
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,805
Can we talk?

638
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:07,851
Will you stop being so stubborn?

639
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:11,354
Did you just yell at me?

640
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:16,860
No.

641
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:20,947
I think my voice tends to sound louder

642
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:23,909
in this room.

643
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,415
I'll leave you to get some rest
if you're tired.

644
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:34,753
Get some rest.

645
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:56,066
Why not?

646
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:58,860
- Cancer.
- Cancer?

647
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:00,904
- You heard me.
- Yikes!

648
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:02,072
It's too late.

649
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:06,034
Did... Did you tell her?

650
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:08,954
Yes.

651
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:12,374
But I think I only made it worse.

652
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:16,544
Did... Did you follow my instructions?

653
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:21,758
I told her that siblings who care
a lot about each other

654
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:25,011
should live together so they won't
end up doing pointless work.

655
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:27,806
I... I bet you made it sound boring.

656
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,643
Some people have a way
of making things sound really boring.

657
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:34,479
Gang-tae, you're so boring.

658
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:41,027
- I'm going to die now!
-"I'm going to die now!

659
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,697
-I have so much resentment and regret.
- I have so much resentment and regret.

660
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:44,990
-There's so much I want to eat.
- There's so much I want to eat.

661
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:46,658
-I feel so bad for myself!
- I feel so bad for myself!

662
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:49,411
-My... My pitiful youth!"
- My... My pitiful youth!

663
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:51,162
My gosh, this is so hard.

664
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:55,166
-Whatever.
-You're not popular

665
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,252
because you're so boring.

666
00:54:57,335 --> 00:55:00,547
Let's be honest.
BLACKPINK is the most popular.

667
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,465
Let's be honest about that.

668
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:18,815
Why are you alone? Did you call Mun-yeong?

669
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:21,693
Yes, but she didn't respond.

670
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:24,195
It was so rude of her not to reply.

671
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:27,574
Hey.

672
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:30,827
Come eat with us.
We have quail eggs and rolled omelet...

673
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,163
Can we talk?

674
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,848
When are you going to leave?

675
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:55,101
You should eat first.

676
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:56,686
You haven't eaten anything.

677
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:58,688
Are you trying to be a live-in-cook?

678
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:02,776
Go back to where you used to live.

679
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,780
-We can't.
-Why not?

680
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:10,325
The water pipe burst.

681
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:13,870
-What?
-The entire place is flooded.

682
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:16,623
It'll take days to fix.

683
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,941
Hey, it's me.

684
00:56:43,983 --> 00:56:45,235
Can you talk right now?

685
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:50,657
NURSES' OFFICE

686
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:52,951
Ju-ri.

687
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:55,537
Shouldn't we tell the patients

688
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,789
that Director O is going to retire?

689
00:56:57,872 --> 00:57:00,041
I feel like they already know.

690
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:02,794
"Things aren't very stable

691
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:05,130
because people keep quitting.

692
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:07,882
If we tell them now,
the patients will feel agitated."

693
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:10,343
That's what Director O said.

694
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:14,514
But shouldn't we at least plan
a retirement ceremony?

695
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:17,308
Gosh, it's not an honorable retirement.

696
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:19,185
I'm leaving because
I'm no longer qualified.

697
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:21,312
You're done with your shift, right?

698
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:22,522
Yes.

699
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:24,399
Let's all go eat.

700
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:26,985
I'll go after I make a phone call.

701
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:36,828
What do you want?

702
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:41,040
Mun-yeong, I'm really sorry,
but can you do me a favor?

703
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:42,292
No, I can't.

704
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:44,377
My mom is sick.

705
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:51,551
She took the day off today
because she's really sick.

706
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:53,970
I called her earlier,
and she didn't sound very well,

707
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:55,472
so I'm really worried about her.

708
00:57:58,099 --> 00:58:01,561
I can't reach Sang-in and Seung-jae
because they went to a seminar,

709
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:02,854
and I have a night shift today.

710
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:05,106
Then ask Gang-tae.

711
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:07,859
I'm really sorry.

712
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:10,695
But can you go instead?

713
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:12,447
I know she's old and all,

714
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:15,158
but she'll feel more comfortable
around a woman.

715
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:17,785
- Can you help?
-No, I can't.

716
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,913
Why would you ask me
to take care of your mom?

717
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:40,058
Hey, you're here.

718
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:47,565
Are you really sick?

719
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:50,735
You seem to have more energy than I do.

720
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:53,821
When you're my age, you're always sick.

721
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:56,241
My knees ache

722
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:58,034
along with the joints in my arms and legs,

723
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:00,453
so I can't even sleep at night. Oh, boy.

724
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:04,624
Nam Ju-ri, that two-faced bitch.

725
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:06,876
Don't badmouth my precious daughter.

726
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,461
Now, come here and eat.

727
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:15,843
Here.

728
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,597
I heard you didn't eat for days.

729
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:23,142
So I cooked scorched rice soup
instead of rice.

730
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:25,728
Here.

731
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:30,984
Sit down.

732
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:36,906
Just go along with it and eat.

733
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:40,201
Do you know how many people
were involved in planning this

734
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:42,453
so we could put something
into that empty stomach?

735
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:51,713
Hey, it's me.

736
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:53,965
Can you talk right now?

737
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:57,260
Why? What is it this time?

738
00:59:57,343 --> 00:59:59,929
You're starting to scare me.

739
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:03,766
No, it's not that.

740
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:08,730
This is a bit embarrassing,
but I need your help.

741
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:11,566
What? "Embarrassing"?

742
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:14,986
Then you should take
the afternoon off tomorrow, Mom.

743
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,863
Okay, sure.

744
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:21,451
Tell Gang-tae to send me a list
of Mun-yeong's favorite food via text.

745
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:26,331
Mun-yeong hasn't been writing, eating,

746
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:27,832
or going outside.

747
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:30,460
I was so worried
that something might happen to her.

748
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:33,046
My gosh, thank you guys so much.

749
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:35,506
My goodness. We're not doing this for you.

750
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:38,426
We're doing it because Gang-tae asked.

751
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:42,930
Then I'll prepare something else

752
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:45,099
other than food.

753
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:46,809
Like what?

754
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:56,402
Hey, Jae-su. It's me, Seung-jae.

755
01:00:56,944 --> 01:01:00,406
By any chance, do you have time
to chat tomorrow?

756
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:02,450
Okay, bye.

757
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:05,620
I think he likes me.

758
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:10,333
I'm serious.

759
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:14,462
My goodness.

760
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:17,465
Sit down and eat.

761
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:21,302
Sit down.

762
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:26,933
There.

763
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:29,852
Eat up.

764
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:39,904
Shit, it's so damn hot!

765
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:47,120
Why would you swear like that
with that precious mouth of yours?

766
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:49,330
Blow on it to cool it down
and eat it slowly.

767
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:50,873
You don't want to burn your mouth.

768
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:03,010
You won't believe it.

769
01:02:04,303 --> 01:02:05,596
Last night,

770
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:08,433
Gang-tae called Sang-in

771
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:12,812
and asked him for help
so he could get you to eat something.

772
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,649
I'm pretty sure he felt bad
about calling me.

773
01:02:17,316 --> 01:02:19,861
I bet he couldn't dare ask me
to cook for you

774
01:02:19,944 --> 01:02:22,488
after how he rejected Ju-ri.

775
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:25,950
But you eventually cooked everything.

776
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:28,536
Exactly. I'm such a fool.

777
01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:37,962
Here.

778
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:39,839
There.

779
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:49,849
Why is everyone

780
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:55,021
so nice to me?

781
01:02:57,732 --> 01:02:59,233
I'm not your family.

782
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:01,360
Because you're pretty.

783
01:03:02,653 --> 01:03:05,990
You're pretty, you eat well,

784
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:09,660
and it's nice how you like Gang-tae
for who he is

785
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:12,580
even though he has nothing to offer.

786
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:36,103
Gosh, I'm hungry.

787
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:37,855
Can I also have some food?

788
01:04:05,716 --> 01:04:08,052
Is... Is this Mom's tree?

789
01:04:08,135 --> 01:04:09,011
Yes.

790
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:13,015
Whenever we miss her,

791
01:04:13,724 --> 01:04:15,601
we just need to come here.

792
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:18,145
Oh, I see.

793
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:22,441
Mom... Mom.

794
01:04:23,317 --> 01:04:26,362
This... This is our new family photo.

795
01:04:26,445 --> 01:04:29,740
The girl in the middle is Mun-yeong.
She's pretty.

796
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:31,409
She... She looks better with long hair.

797
01:04:31,492 --> 01:04:34,912
But Gang-tae cut her hair like this.

798
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:39,667
Mom.

799
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:43,087
I

800
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:45,756
grew up well, didn't I?

801
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:52,680
Yes, you grew up well.

802
01:04:53,764 --> 01:04:55,600
And so did I.

803
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:59,854
Mom, I hope you also grow up
into a big tree.

804
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:03,149
From now on,

805
01:05:04,358 --> 01:05:06,027
I'll take good care of Sang-tae,

806
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:08,863
Mom.

807
01:05:09,363 --> 01:05:12,491
She... She didn't have you
so you could take care of me.

808
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:14,410
You...

809
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:18,080
You weren't born to take care of me.

810
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:20,708
That's...

811
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:24,128
That's not why Mom gave birth to you.

812
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:28,257
Older brothers are supposed to
take care of younger brothers.

813
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:30,635
And... And that's why I hit that bad woman

814
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:33,095
on the back of her head.

815
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:36,849
I... I protected you
while you were sleeping.

816
01:05:41,062 --> 01:05:42,063
You're right.

817
01:05:43,898 --> 01:05:45,149
You were born

818
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:47,777
to protect me.

819
01:05:48,986 --> 01:05:53,157
Yes, but you're all grown up now,
so it's time you take care of yourself.

820
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:55,785
I'm... I'm busy now.

821
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:57,161
Bye, Mom.

822
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:03,834
Mom.

823
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:07,338
Did you hear that?

824
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:17,932
Wait for me.

825
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:28,985
I'll be honest with you.

826
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:32,363
I sometimes think
he might be a psychopath.

827
01:06:32,446 --> 01:06:35,908
He's way too cold-hearted and indifferent.

828
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:37,326
I agree.

829
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:40,871
I really hate it how he sometimes
puts on a fake expression.

830
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,833
I know, right? My gosh.

831
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:46,293
On top of that, he's also out of his mind.

832
01:06:48,045 --> 01:06:50,256
Do you know what he said to me last time
at my restaurant?

833
01:06:51,799 --> 01:06:53,175
Serengeti.

834
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:56,554
Serengeti.

835
01:06:56,637 --> 01:06:58,472
Do you even know where that is?

836
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:00,516
At first, I thought he was
talking about spaghetti.

837
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:04,145
Serengeti is a place in Africa.
It's all the way in Africa.

838
01:07:04,228 --> 01:07:07,523
He wanted to go there
when he doesn't even have a passport.

839
01:07:07,606 --> 01:07:09,025
He's crazy.

840
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:10,860
Why is that crazy?

841
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:13,279
What?

842
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,868
Why is it crazy
that he wants to go to Serengeti?

843
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:20,327
Why?

844
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,580
My gosh, you startled me.

845
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:54,737
My goodness.

846
01:07:56,822 --> 01:07:58,449
Did you go somewhere?

847
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:00,284
Sang-tae.

848
01:08:01,035 --> 01:08:02,745
You reek of alcohol.

849
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:07,750
Sang-tae.

850
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:11,712
Can you ask Gang-tae

851
01:08:13,297 --> 01:08:16,550
what excuse he's going to use tomorrow
to stay here?

852
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:20,846
I went to Ju-ri's house,

853
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:23,390
and their water pipe was fine.

854
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:28,854
Over my dead body.

855
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:31,941
Do you have a death wish?

856
01:08:32,024 --> 01:08:35,945
What? Oh, here.
You need to check my homework.

857
01:08:36,862 --> 01:08:39,240
I told you not to bother.

858
01:08:39,532 --> 01:08:41,826
I'm done writing fairy tales.

859
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:43,494
I'm going to stop.

860
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:45,496
No.

861
01:08:46,330 --> 01:08:47,498
I'm going to retire.

862
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:53,629
You... You need to check my homework
so I can become an illustrator.

863
01:08:53,712 --> 01:08:56,173
So... So check my homework.

864
01:08:56,757 --> 01:08:58,884
Gosh, you're so stubborn.

865
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:04,890
If... If you don't write,
I'll publish a book with someone else.

866
01:09:05,057 --> 01:09:06,851
I... I want to keep drawing.

867
01:09:08,602 --> 01:09:12,189
My gosh, you have no loyalty.

868
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:14,692
You're just going to work with whomever?

869
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:18,154
No... No, not whomever.

870
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:20,030
I'll be working with a real partner.

871
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:25,619
Okay, fine. Let's take a look.

872
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:29,123
They used to be stick figures.
Let's see how much you've improved.

873
01:09:33,627 --> 01:09:36,714
Take... Take a look.

874
01:09:37,798 --> 01:09:39,717
He looks happy.

875
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:44,972
He... He smiled like this

876
01:09:45,055 --> 01:09:47,850
after he told me he likes someone.

877
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:49,185
He smiled.

878
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:54,023
This... This is how Gang-tae looks
when he's happy.

879
01:09:54,106 --> 01:09:57,067
Take... Take a look at this.

880
01:09:57,151 --> 01:10:02,198
It's... It's not fake. He's really happy.

881
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:05,159
Gang-tae... Gang-tae looks happy.

882
01:10:05,242 --> 01:10:08,120
I drew him
because I saw it for the first time.

883
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:22,134
Look. Right here.

884
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:30,100
It's a happy expression.

885
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:32,436
Why are you crying?

886
01:10:33,687 --> 01:10:35,022
Because it's beautiful.

887
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:39,610
It's so beautiful.

888
01:10:43,989 --> 01:10:45,699
Do you want it?

889
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,078
Yes.

890
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:51,580
I want it.

891
01:10:53,832 --> 01:10:55,125
Can I have it?

892
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:05,302
Here. I'll let you have it.

893
01:11:13,018 --> 01:11:17,731
I... I really want to publish
a fairy tale book.

894
01:11:19,233 --> 01:11:22,987
I... I want to take my book
and show it to my mom.

895
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:25,030
I want to tell her I'm an illustrator now.

896
01:11:31,912 --> 01:11:32,746
Your mom?

897
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:37,793
Yes, we planted a tree for her
at OK Psychiatric Hospital.

898
01:11:38,377 --> 01:11:39,586
My mom's tree.

899
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:09,241
I'm sorry.

900
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:14,079
I'm so sorry.

901
01:12:28,052 --> 01:12:29,011
I

902
01:12:30,095 --> 01:12:31,138
followed you.

903
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:37,102
Your hobby is to kidnap people.

904
01:12:38,979 --> 01:12:40,606
My hobby is to tail people.

905
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:48,238
Do you think that's funny?

906
01:12:52,576 --> 01:12:53,994
I might not be funny.

907
01:12:58,165 --> 01:12:59,750
But I do want to impress you.

908
01:13:05,964 --> 01:13:07,716
I'll keep trying.

909
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:10,803
I'll do everything I can

910
01:13:12,763 --> 01:13:14,431
to overcome what happened

911
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:17,267
and cope with it.

912
01:13:19,853 --> 01:13:20,771
So please

913
01:13:22,022 --> 01:13:23,482
stop pushing me away.

914
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:25,943
Let me stay by your side.

915
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:28,612
Please?

916
01:13:44,336 --> 01:13:45,295
Then what about this?

917
01:13:47,047 --> 01:13:48,173
How will you compensate for this?

918
01:13:56,056 --> 01:13:57,224
I'm sorry

919
01:13:58,559 --> 01:13:59,643
I made you get hurt.

920
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:16,118
I love you!

921
01:14:29,089 --> 01:14:31,133
I love you, Mun-yeong.

922
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:47,357
I love you!

923
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:49,860
I said, I love you!

924
01:14:54,448 --> 01:14:56,200
I love you so much!

925
01:14:58,202 --> 01:15:00,037
I said I love you! Why are you leaving?

926
01:15:03,123 --> 01:15:03,957
Hey!

927
01:15:05,042 --> 01:15:06,168
I love you!

928
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:10,756
Mun-yeong!

929
01:15:11,381 --> 01:15:12,466
Wait...

930
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:14,927
Mun-yeong, I love you.

931
01:15:15,969 --> 01:15:18,680
-Shouldn't he get admitted?
-I love you! Will you please stop?

932
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:21,099
Mr. Moon has changed so much.

933
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:23,310
Love changes people.

934
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:40,702
Mun-yeong.

935
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:44,122
I love you.

936
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:47,042
Is that not it? Is it something else?

937
01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:49,044
Will you please say something?

938
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:52,798
If you tell me you love me one more time,
I might just...

939
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:02,849
You might just what?

940
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:08,564
Do this?

941
01:17:37,361 --> 01:17:39,946
I want to become a real illustrator.

942
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:40,864
A real one.

943
01:17:40,947 --> 01:17:42,824
No. You can't see it.

944
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:44,493
-Get out.
-Why am I an outsider?

945
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:47,954
They're publishing a fairy tale together

946
01:17:48,038 --> 01:17:49,831
so I have been ostracized.

947
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:54,127
How long do you think
they will stay with you?

948
01:17:54,628 --> 01:17:56,380
You will never be able to erase me.

949
01:17:57,964 --> 01:17:59,299
This is my last manuscript.

950
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:02,594
You can discard it or publish it.

951
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:03,553
It's up to you.

952
01:18:03,637 --> 01:18:06,139
I really hope you're not in pain anymore.

953
01:18:06,765 --> 01:18:07,974
I'm sorry.

954
01:18:09,893 --> 01:18:14,856
