1
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:29,380
Sang-tae.

2
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,467
Sang-tae.

3
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,493
How long have you known?

4
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,705
When did you figure out who I am?

5
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,085
You said my eyes reminded you of her.

6
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,629
You're not running away.
You're not avoiding me either.

7
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,464
You grew up nicely.

8
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:57,010
I'd say you didn't just grow,
you went through an evolution.

9
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:01,347
I probably knew   the moment

10
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,184
I first looked into your eyes.

11
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,193
You really know how to put on an act.

12
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:15,778
You could win an Oscar.

13
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,114
Was it fun?

14
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,326
You pretended not to know it.
How despicable of you.

15
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,036
How dare you fool me?

16
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,291
-You also did the same--
-I...

17
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,339
I didn't pretend I didn't know you.

18
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,256
I know.

19
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,302
You wanted me to recognize you.

20
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,722
But I wanted to avoid you.

21
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,476
I wanted to act like I didn't know
and ignore you.

22
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,769
Why?

23
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,689
I already told you.

24
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:54,859
She saved my life,

25
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:57,946
but I ran.

26
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,366
Like a coward.

27
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,328
And I've been running away since then.

28
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,580
Are you sick of putting on
your despicable act?

29
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,624
Then why are you telling me now?

30
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,129
So that I can properly end this.

31
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,132
Thank you

32
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:24,305
for saving me that day
at the frozen river.

33
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:27,684
I'm sorry

34
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:30,937
for running away
when I was the one who liked you first.

35
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,483
-I regretted it the moment I turned away--
-Cut it out.

36
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,612
I didn't get to say this to you

37
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,449
-that day when I came here.
-Stop talking.

38
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,951
That kept bothering me,

39
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,998
and I think that's why
I couldn't get over you.

40
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,792
So you have no feelings for me now?

41
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,170
My brother is already a handful.

42
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,173
That's more than enough.

43
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,139
You care for him, so why not me?

44
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,391
Take care of me, too. I need you, too.

45
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:17,317
I'm done with being someone
who is needed by others.

46
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,956
You can't reject me.

47
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,417
I saved your life.
I let you live that day.

48
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,295
And I thanked you for that.

49
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:41,257
Because you saved my life that day,
I've been living a fucked up life.

50
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,682
I'll kill you if you go.

51
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,644
You can't run away. You're mine.

52
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,367
Have you lost it? Do you want to die?

53
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:09,911
Don't go.

54
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:14,248
Let's live together.

55
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:17,919
Let me go.

56
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,171
Gang-tae?

57
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:23,758
Sang-tae.

58
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,219
Are you okay?

59
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,471
-Are you feeling better?
-Yes.

60
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:31,182
Why did you drink?

61
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:32,934
Let's go home.

62
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:36,521
This... This is... This is my home now.

63
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:38,648
What?

64
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,067
I need... I need to live here now.

65
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,444
I... I made a promise.

66
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,905
What are you talking about?

67
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:49,867
I... Ms. Ko... I'm also...

68
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:53,454
I'm... I'm also an illustrator now.

69
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,002
-Give me that.
-No, it's... It's mine.

70
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,337
He signed a deal with me.

71
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,923
As my illustrator for my books.

72
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,884
He'll be working here.

73
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:11,764
"The employee... The employee will live
in the employer's studio

74
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,058
and draw illustrations from there."

75
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,853
I told you, didn't I?

76
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,480
You can't run away from me.

77
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,401
Give me that, Sang-tae.

78
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,319
No, it's mine. No.

79
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,780
That's no good. You're being deceived.

80
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,867
-Give me that. Give it.
-No, it's... It's mine.

81
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,660
-Give it to me.
-I'm an illustrator.

82
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:34,078
-I'll live here.
-Sang-tae.

83
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,247
This is our home now.

84
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,999
This is not our home!

85
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,552
No! No, that belongs to Sang-tae!

86
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,512
It's mine! No! That's mine!

87
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,848
-That's mine!
-Sang-tae!

88
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:57,685
It belongs to Moon Sang-tae!
I belong to myself! You don't own me!

89
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,312
Sang-tae!

90
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,025
No, it's mine! Mine!

91
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:07,236
No!

92
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,239
I belong to myself!

93
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,659
Moon Sang-tae belongs to Moon Sang-tae!

94
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,580
I'm not yours! I belong to myself!

95
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,999
I belong to myself!

96
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,251
Moon Sang-tae! I belong to myself!

97
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,669
-Stop it.
-It's mine!

98
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,505
I'm not yours!

99
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,840
No! It's not yours!

100
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,843
-Stop it.
-You don't own me!

101
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,105
Sang-tae.

102
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,316
Go back inside.

103
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,946
I...

104
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:53,533
Go on.

105
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,203
Go on.

106
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:02,625
Moon Sang-tae belongs to Moon Sang-tae.
I don't belong to you.

107
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,592
I belong to myself.

108
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:15,012
Moon Sang-tae belongs to Moon Sang-tae.
I'm not yours!

109
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,244
Your brother abandoned you.

110
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,289
Now, it's your turn to choose.

111
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:45,084
Will you also abandon your brother,
or will you…

112
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:49,005
let him lock you down your entire life?

113
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:56,721
Don't end up being fickle about it
like you were back then.

114
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:49,732
CHAPTER 6
BLUEBEARD'S SECRET

115
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,212
Mom!

116
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:13,297
Mom!

117
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:19,887
Mom, I got my red belt today...

118
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:22,682
Gang-tae!

119
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,477
Why did you do that? Why?

120
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,521
Why did you send him home first?

121
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,190
You should've stayed with him all day!

122
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,859
Where were you
when he was getting beaten up?

123
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:37,071
I let you learn martial arts
so you could protect him.

124
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,824
How could you let him come home
like this?

125
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,284
MOON GANG-TAE

126
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,123
My job

127
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,042
isn't to protect Sang-tae.

128
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:52,670
What?

129
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,298
I don't belong to Sang-tae!

130
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,384
I belong to myself!

131
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:01,429
Moon Gang-tae belongs to Moon Gang-tae!

132
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,437
What did you say?

133
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,732
What did you just say?

134
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,066
"Moon Gang-tae

135
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,111
belongs to Moon Gang-tae!"

136
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:25,703
I just want

137
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,040
my brother to die!

138
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,005
Gang-tae.

139
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,258
This belongs to Gang-tae!

140
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,012
This belongs to Moon Gang-tae!

141
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,483
Gang-tae!

142
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,734
Gang-tae!

143
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,614
This belongs to Gang-tae!

144
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,203
This belongs to Moon Gang-tae.

145
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,965
This belongs to Moon Gang-tae.

146
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,051
MOON GANG-TAE

147
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:23,886
Get up.

148
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:33,938
This belongs to Gang-tae.

149
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,581
That's mine.

150
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,086
That's mine. It's mine.

151
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:03,592
Give me that.

152
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,691
Give me that. Give it back.

153
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:21,610
There!

154
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,657
Come on!

155
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,036
Sang-tae, don't... Goodness.

156
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,997
Sang-tae.

157
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,926
It's mine!

158
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:50,222
This belongs to Moon Sang-tae!

159
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,105
Sang-tae!

160
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,610
-Sang-tae...
-Gang-tae!

161
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,738
Gang-tae!

162
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,364
Gang-tae!

163
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,911
Gang-tae! Help!

164
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,038
Gang-tae!

165
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:19,501
I just want my brother to die!

166
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,048
Gang... Gang-tae!

167
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:25,841
Gang-tae!

168
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,802
Gang-tae!

169
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:30,971
Gang-tae!

170
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:32,890
Gang-tae!

171
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,017
Gang...

172
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,479
Gang-tae!

173
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,272
-Keep going.
-Gang-tae!

174
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,029
Just go.

175
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,710
Just leave him.

176
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:12,012
Gang-tae!

177
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:12,930
Help!

178
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:14,723
Climb up the ice!

179
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:16,558
Sang-tae!

180
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:18,435
Go up!

181
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,812
How boring.

182
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:21,438
Sang-tae.

183
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,568
-Gang-tae.
-Sang-tae!

184
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:28,696
Sang-tae!

185
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,823
Sang-tae, hold my hand.

186
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,284
Sang-tae!

187
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,537
Sang-tae, help me get out!

188
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,913
Help!

189
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,623
Sang-tae! Help me!

190
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,083
Sang-tae!

191
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:45,796
Sang-tae.

192
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,339
Sang-tae!

193
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:57,975
Shall I help him?

194
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,147
Or not?

195
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,280
Shall I help him?

196
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,417
Or not?

197
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:27,689
Wait.

198
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,733
Because you saved my life that day,

199
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,652
I've been living a fucked up life.

200
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,994
Sang-tae.

201
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,622
Don't worry.

202
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,458
He can't abandon you.

203
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,614
The employee will live
in the employer's studio

204
00:19:58,697 --> 00:19:59,865
and draw illustrations.

205
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:05,120
The employer will acknowledge the employee
as the best illustrator in the world.

206
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,749
The employer will buy the employee

207
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:11,210
a walk through van camping car
instead of paying him.

208
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,880
The employee has a little brother
who doesn't like to move.

209
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,136
KO MUN-YEONG, MOON SANG-TAE

210
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,652
Excuse me.

211
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:22,948
I'll take this, this, and this.

212
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:27,035
-I want this one.
- I'll take everything except for this one.

213
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:32,291
Do you think she'll accept you
just because of this?

214
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:36,044
That's not the problem.
She can't write if she's low on sugar.

215
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,673
We need to make sure she gets her fix
every now and then. How much is it?

216
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:42,301
-It's 52,200 won.
-Why can't he be nice to me as well?

217
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,351
Something doesn't feel right.

218
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,147
-That's why your business went under.
-You darn brat.

219
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,818
We need to get there first
before she brings someone else

220
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:01,778
to that cursed castle.

221
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:03,447
Hurry up and eat.

222
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,076
Gosh, it's so hot.

223
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,335
My goodness.

224
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,424
-Today's your day off, right?
-Yes.

225
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:25,552
My parents sent me some potatoes,
so I boiled...

226
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:29,765
What happened to your face?

227
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,934
Did a patient throw a fit?

228
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:36,063
-No, not at all.
-Did you fight with someone?

229
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:38,940
Did you?

230
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,693
I had an argument with Sang-tae.

231
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:42,861
An argument, my foot.

232
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,738
It looks like he beat you up.

233
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:46,782
My goodness.

234
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,327
Sang-tae!

235
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,080
If you hit your brother like that
one more time,

236
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,082
I'll have to give you a scolding!

237
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,127
-He's not home.
-He even ran away?

238
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,008
No, that's not it.

239
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,512
My goodness, that's great.

240
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,890
Does that mean
Sang-tae is an illustrator now?

241
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,146
Do you really think it's a good thing?

242
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,816
Of course it's a good thing.

243
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,568
I'd like to thank that person

244
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:27,572
for giving Sang-tae
such a great opportunity.

245
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:33,453
Gang-tae.

246
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:37,124
You should root for him.

247
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,503
You took good care of him until now.

248
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:45,632
Now, it's time for you
to let him do what he wants.

249
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,221
You shouldn't stop people
from doing what they want

250
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,890
or liking someone.

251
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,767
Plus, it's impossible.

252
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,850
-Who...
-Gosh.

253
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,859
-Who was that?
-It's that guy.

254
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:48,236
He's that caregiver's older brother.

255
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:50,780
The guy who caused a scene
at the bookstore.

256
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:53,366
My gosh, it's that caregiver again?

257
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,286
Hey, Mun-yeong. Open the door.

258
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:59,080
Hey, open the door. Let me in.

259
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,125
Okay, fine. I'll just break the door.

260
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:03,543
One.

261
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,253
Who's being so loud?

262
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:07,464
Two, three.

263
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:16,014
Why are you here?

264
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:21,561
-Kick him out of here right now.
-But I live here.

265
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,813
-What?
-He's right. We're living together.

266
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:27,734
We live together.
We're not married, but we live together.

267
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:30,195
-My gosh.
-You're living with this guy?

268
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:33,615
"The employee will live
in the employer's studio

269
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,909
-and draw illustrations."
-What illustrations?

270
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:38,203
Say hello to my exclusive illustrator.

271
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,497
Hello. I'm Moon Sang-tae, 35 years old.

272
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,832
My blood type is AB,
and rat is my zodiac animal.

273
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,376
I have autism spectrum disorder.

274
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,503
But I have no problem
taking care of myself.

275
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,423
I'm Yoo Seung-jae, the art director
in charge of illustrations--

276
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,342
No, I'm against this team!

277
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:53,843
-I'm all for it.
-Me too.

278
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,011
Me too.

279
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:57,514
Mun-yeong.

280
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,140
You cause trouble

281
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:02,185
because you can't control yourself.
How will you care for him?

282
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,271
What if both of you end up
causing trouble?

283
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:09,901
My safety pin.

284
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,069
What? What pin?

285
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,113
I have my safety pin, so don't worry.

286
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:21,705
Gang-tae.

287
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,125
My brother.
He's... He's my little brother.

288
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,544
-We met him last time.
-My little brother.

289
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:30,255
He may be a coward,
but he's still my little brother.

290
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:32,799
Are you okay?

291
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:35,468
I'm sorry.

292
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,556
-It's okay. Let's go inside.
-Okay.

293
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:46,688
Mun-yeong.

294
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:48,607
Mun-yeong. Hey...

295
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,197
An author with a personality disorder

296
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,700
and an illustrator
with a developmental disorder…

297
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:02,287
Sir, this will either be a huge success
or a complete disaster.

298
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:04,331
My gosh.

299
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:08,960
What?

300
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:12,714
Give me your car keys.

301
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,302
My car keys? Why?

302
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,430
The mountain road is pretty rough,
so I need an SUV.

303
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:22,515
It's my car anyway. Goodbye then.

304
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:45,997
Goodness gracious.

305
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:47,874
I must've been crazy.

306
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:51,753
I can't believe
I said those things to him.

307
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,881
My goodness. Oh, by the way,

308
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:58,635
what's the name of the writer
that Sang-tae will be working with?

309
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,763
Ms. Ko Mun-yeong.

310
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,348
You've met her once.

311
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,849
Ko Mun-yeong...

312
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,685
He shouted only her name.

313
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:09,062
My gosh, what is wrong with me?

314
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,356
My goodness, why?

315
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:15,485
I feel so bad for my daughter.

316
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:20,281
-Mom.
-My goodness, my heart.

317
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:24,369
Why are you so startled?

318
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:26,705
What... What are you talking about?

319
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,624
Get me some water
so I can take my medicine.

320
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:40,510
I'll have them ready.

321
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:42,220
It'll only take five minutes.

322
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,264
Five minutes.

323
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,934
You chose your brother again.

324
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:51,896
I have a few conditions.

325
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,691
Did I play a part in helping you
come to a decision?

326
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:02,073
He can stay during the weekdays.
I'm taking him home on weekends.

327
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,366
Did I not play a part?

328
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:07,287
There.

329
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:11,499
If he wishes to quit,
I'll take him back whenever.

330
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,251
Not even just a little bit?

331
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:15,211
And...

332
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,507
Respect him as much as you can.

333
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,222
Okay, I will.

334
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:27,682
How can I trust you?

335
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,477
-Will a blood contract do?
-You said promises are rubbish.

336
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:36,107
I'll keep my word.
Because it's a promise I made to you.

337
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,412
No, please...

338
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,625
No, please.

339
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,960
Gang-tae! Moon Gang-tae!

340
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:04,886
They're gone.

341
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,723
Hey, do you have a death wish?

342
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,184
Do you want to be stabbed again?

343
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,728
I've warned you
not to go anywhere near that bitch.

344
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,939
I can't believe
you even moved in with her.

345
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,982
Have you lost your mind? Are you insane?

346
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:20,068
Get back here before it's too late.

347
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:24,155
Come back to me, please!

348
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,786
-That blabbermouth.
-Mom.

349
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,622
What's with Jae-su? Is he drunk?

350
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:35,917
Oh, the thing is...

351
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:37,877
Well...

352
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,761
Ko Mun-yeong.

353
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,389
You evil witch!

354
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,274
This is where you'll work from now on.

355
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:01,860
There are so many books!

356
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,947
Upstairs... There are more books upstairs.

357
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:10,493
-Be careful, Sang-tae.
-That old man is huge!

358
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,161
There are so many books!

359
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,998
Sang-tae loves books.

360
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,082
What do you like?

361
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:21,754
-Nothing in particular.
-Sang-tae asked me to buy a camping car.

362
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,423
Do you like to travel?

363
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:26,009
-I've never traveled anywhere.
-Not even once?

364
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,971
-I'd like to travel.
-Where would you go?

365
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,056
Anywhere.

366
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:34,350
Without a set destination.

367
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:37,520
We've never traveled,
but we've moved so many times.

368
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:39,939
About 17 times. This is our 18th move.

369
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:42,150
-Sang-tae.
-Why did you move so many times?

370
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,819
-Because it follows me wherever I go.
-Who follows you?

371
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,905
-Sang-tae.
-It follows me wherever I go--

372
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,615
Come on.

373
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:50,158
Where's our room?

374
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:54,203
There are so many books!

375
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:05,465
Hi!

376
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,140
How pretty!

377
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,975
My room is so nice.

378
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,810
This was my room when I was little.

379
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,943
-You guys will need another bed over here.
-My room is so nice.

380
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:29,781
You've never had a bed before?

381
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:32,951
No.

382
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:38,206
Darn it. These sheets...

383
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:41,459
-When did you wash these?
-About 20 years ago?

384
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,838
It's true vintage.

385
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,716
I can see outside from here!

386
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,051
Gosh, Sang-tae!

387
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:53,513
I'm stoked! This is so soft.

388
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,181
This is very soft.

389
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:58,017
How soft. Is this my bed?

390
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,061
Gosh, it's so soft.

391
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,755
-No one saw you, right?
-One person saw me.

392
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,924
-Who?
-Professor Ko.

393
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:31,426
Mr. Ko Dae-hwan?

394
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,387
Yes, he sat up and said...

395
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,805
Where are you going?

396
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,560
Are you going somewhere?

397
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:44,063
That's what he said.
Gosh, I almost got a heart attack.

398
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,940
I was so startled that I wet my pants.

399
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:47,525
Really?

400
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,948
-You need to change your underwear.
-It's okay.

401
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:08,546
Oh my. This tastes better
since I haven't had it for a while.

402
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:09,589
It's sweet, isn't it?

403
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:12,717
That's soda.

404
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,886
That's the placebo effect.

405
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,764
If you think that it's soju,
it'll actually taste like it.

406
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:20,183
Then you should've told me
after I finished this.

407
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:23,811
I told you to just leave
if you want to drink real booze.

408
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,688
Why are you staying here?

409
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,858
It's not time yet.

410
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:30,777
You and your excuses.

411
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,571
Now tell me.
Anything new about the patients?

412
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:37,408
But shouldn't you be able
to pick out these things

413
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,494
during your sessions with the patients

414
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,788
and diagnose them?
I mean, you're a doctor.

415
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,624
There's a saying that goes like this.

416
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,960
"Only those who have suffered
truly understand suffering."

417
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,214
Right. Experience beats knowledge.

418
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:54,509
And there are limits to what the patients
tell me during the sessions.

419
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:57,428
Patients often deceive their doctors.

420
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:58,679
That's true.

421
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,473
You know Joo Jeong-tae, right?

422
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,642
-The alcoholic in my room.
-Yes.

423
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:04,268
When he went out last week,

424
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,395
he filled sanitary gloves with soju

425
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,606
and hid them in his underwear
to smuggle them.

426
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:57,113
Well, down there...

427
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,364
Sang-tae.

428
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,993
Have you ever heard
the story of  Bluebeard?

429
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:08,291
Once upon a time,
a count with a blue beard

430
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,878
lived alone in a huge castle.

431
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,840
-Welcome.
- He was very wealthy,

432
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:18,801
but everyone avoided him out of fear

433
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,929
because of his blue beard.

434
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,640
But one day,

435
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:29,312
a poor woman came to the castle

436
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,898
and said that she wanted to be his bride.

437
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:36,027
Brimming with joy,

438
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:40,281
Bluebeard brought out all the jewels
and treasures from each room

439
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:43,326
and gave them to his wife as a gift.

440
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,496
However, there was an exception.

441
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:51,292
The room in the basement.

442
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:56,964
He warned her to never go into that room.

443
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,967
But his curious wife

444
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:04,847
eventually opened the secret door
without telling her husband.

445
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:10,853
Do you know what was in that room?

446
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:15,900
Corpses of women

447
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,903
were displayed on the walls.

448
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:23,115
They were the wives of Bluebeard
who had ignored his warning

449
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,117
and opened that door.

450
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:28,329
That's how they all ended up.

451
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,627
Is that how it ends?

452
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,171
Yes.

453
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,675
Sang-tae.

454
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:42,927
Don't go down

455
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,763
to the basement without permission.

456
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:48,391
This isn't our house.

457
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,231
But why were the villagers

458
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,401
afraid of Bluebeard?

459
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:03,489
Because he was different from them.

460
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,492
His beard was blue.

461
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,954
Is being different
something to be afraid of?

462
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:21,257
I guess so.

463
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:25,428
Do you have to live alone in a castle
when you're different?

464
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:27,638
No.

465
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:32,810
He will eventually find his true love

466
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,187
who isn't afraid of his blue beard

467
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:38,274
and tells him
that it's okay to be different.

468
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:42,611
Someone who understands him for who he is.

469
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:27,531
They didn't move out for good.

470
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,283
They'll be back on the weekends.

471
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,993
They'll go back and forth and--

472
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,579
Jeez! Just pick a lane and stick with it!

473
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:41,670
It's not like she talked Gang-tae into it
to seduce him.

474
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,339
It's strictly about work--

475
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:47,551
Seriously! Turn on your blinker.

476
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:51,889
Hey! Just lash out at me
and stop honking, will you?

477
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,099
What is your mouth for?

478
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,560
I'd staple your lips
if you weren't my mom.

479
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,731
Just say it, okay?

480
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,319
Honk, honk, honk!

481
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,196
Honk, honk, honk!

482
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:09,824
Have you lost your mind?

483
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,034
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

484
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:12,952
Sir.

485
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:15,871
What is your name?

486
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:20,501
Do you know where you are now?

487
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:25,714
This is odd.

488
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:29,635
His condition can change suddenly,

489
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,929
so keep an eye on him and update me.

490
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:32,847
Yes, sir.

491
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:37,893
Where have you been?

492
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,689
I was feeling a little stuffy
so I went for a walk.

493
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:43,482
Last week...

494
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:44,400
Ko...

495
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,736
Dae-hwan.

496
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,199
What did you say?

497
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:55,244
She's

498
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,664
so beautiful.

499
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:01,500
She looks

500
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:05,921
like an angel.

501
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,509
Who looks like an angel?

502
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,729
Mun-yeong's...

503
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,024
mother.

504
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,699
You shouldn't be drinking.

505
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:35,034
I didn't drink.

506
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:48,214
It's probably too soon
for another one-on-one with Ms. Ko, right?

507
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:51,800
You know what happened last time
they went out for a walk.

508
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,470
But are you sure
he did that to his daughter?

509
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:56,472
What do you mean?

510
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:02,853
It's possible that he saw someone else
when he was looking at her.

511
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:06,607
Who?

512
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:08,317
We have to find out.

513
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:12,279
Your snitch didn't tell you
anything about that?

514
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,533
I'll keep the linen room locked
from now on.

515
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,621
She knows everything.

516
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:36,637
I slept so well.

517
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:04,164
Ms. Ko, did you sleep well?

518
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,082
Oh, yes.

519
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:13,841
We got up at 6 a.m.
We washed all the sheets,

520
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:16,385
picked up groceries, and cleaned

521
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:18,679
while you slept.

522
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:31,483
Come and eat.

523
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:33,569
Sang-tae, go wash your hands.

524
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,656
Hands should be washed in the bathroom.

525
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:47,499
What do you have for breakfast?
We usually just have rice for breakfast.

526
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,045
Do you prefer bread?

527
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:53,756
No, rice.

528
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:55,090
Okay.

529
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,063
I want a lot.

530
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:23,786
Do you want more?

531
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:25,371
Sure.

532
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:34,380
Don't just say that you'll be here.

533
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,674
Come today, okay?

534
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:41,261
PUBLIC PHONE

535
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:45,808
This guy is a real catch.

536
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,395
Remember your blind date in Dogok-dong?

537
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,647
That plastic surgeon
who looked like an octopus.

538
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:54,483
This guy is 1,000 times
more handsome than him.

539
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:59,238
You only care about looks
because you take after me.

540
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:02,408
Really?

541
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:06,161
You'll come today?

542
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:12,292
So you're saying
Ms. Kang Eun-ja hasn't paid you back

543
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:15,254
for all the snacks she borrowed from you?

544
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:16,380
That's right.

545
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:18,841
Talk about stealing from the poor.

546
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,592
I mean, she's rich. What's with her?

547
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:24,930
She asked for money and said
she'd pay back when her daughter comes.

548
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:27,641
Right, she even took my chocolate.
My chocolate and chips--

549
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,518
She's in a crisis. Be careful.

550
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:31,770
Call the cops.
I want to talk to the manager.

551
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:33,856
-Let me talk to the director.
-All right.

552
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:37,818
We heard you. We'll look into it.

553
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,320
Please return to your rooms for now.

554
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:41,655
Go on.

555
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:45,033
My daughter is...

556
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,663
Have a nice day.

557
00:45:56,837 --> 00:46:00,340
She doesn't look too crazy
when you look at her.

558
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:06,388
What?

559
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:09,141
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

560
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:27,242
Well… Let's come separately next time.
People will get the wrong idea.

561
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,369
When are you done?
Go home with me. I'll wait.

562
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:33,040
Does your car run on gasoline or diesel?
I smell gasoline.

563
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:42,132
Pay me depending on how I do.

564
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:48,013
That's odd.

565
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:49,973
It's missing something.

566
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:53,727
Butterflies.

567
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:57,022
There should be butterflies
where there are flowers.

568
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:59,316
There are so many flowers,

569
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:02,319
yet I don't see a single butterfly.

570
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:07,658
Well, it's still a work in progress,
so I'm sure you'll draw them in soon.

571
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:09,993
No, I refuse. I refuse.

572
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:11,829
Is it hard to draw them?

573
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:15,415
Then should I try drawing one?

574
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,584
No, don't! No butterflies!

575
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,962
Not here. They can't come here.
No butterflies.

576
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:23,340
No way. No butterflies!

577
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:25,884
No, butterflies can't come here.

578
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:26,802
No way.

579
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:02,337
Mr. Moon, didn't Ms. Ko
scan her access card a few minutes ago?

580
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:06,174
-Yes. Why do you ask?
-Then why isn't she in class yet?

581
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:08,260
Everyone's waiting, but I can't reach her.

582
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:09,887
I'll look for her too.

583
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,013
Thank you.

584
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:20,689
UNDER CONSTRUCTION
DO NOT ENTER

585
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:54,890
Why are you surprised?

586
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,274
Did you forget about me already?

587
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,239
It's me, your mom.

588
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,413
The person you're calling…

589
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,332
Gosh. Where is she?

590
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:32,010
I've been waiting for you all this time.

591
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:44,481
You're so skinny now.

592
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:49,152
Still, in my eyes,

593
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:54,324
you're the prettiest girl
in the whole world.

594
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,416
Why won't you say anything?

595
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:09,506
Don't tell me you don't recognize me
just because of a few plastic surgeries.

596
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:18,265
Mom?

597
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:23,395
Is it

598
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:26,940
really you?

599
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:32,779
You're back?

600
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,825
What's the matter with you?

601
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,327
You were only away for a month
for your concert,

602
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:41,580
but you're acting like
a complete stranger.

603
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:44,249
My concert?

604
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,168
I told you over the phone

605
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,546
that there's a guy
who's totally your type.

606
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:53,300
Nothing bad comes out of
listening to your mom.

607
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:54,217
Just meet him.

608
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:56,303
You'll like him.

609
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:59,931
He's tall and buff.
But more importantly, his eyes.

610
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:02,601
He's got such nice eyes.

611
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:03,852
You crazy woman!

612
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:05,562
-Stop.
-What?

613
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:10,108
Ms. Kang, you need to take
your medications.

614
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:12,486
-You should return--
-Oh, it's you.

615
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,155
I looked everywhere for you.

616
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:18,658
Hey, this young man is the guy
I told you about earlier.

617
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:21,620
What do you think? Handsome, no?

618
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:23,413
-Let's go back to your room.
-Okay.

619
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:29,336
She can be a little prickly,
but she's very thoughtful.

620
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:32,547
She studied music in Germany
and is a flutist at a symphony orchestra.

621
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:37,385
But she's been traveling back and forth
between Germany and Korea

622
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:39,387
to look after me.

623
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:44,976
A SEVERE FORM OF DEPRESSION

624
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,353
Her depression is so severe

625
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:48,605
that she's having
hallucinations and delusions.

626
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:51,483
She receives welfare checks

627
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,736
but she believes she is the mistress
of some wealthy CEO.

628
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:58,115
-It sounded like she has a daughter.
-She did.

629
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:03,537
Her only child who she struggled to raise
as a single mother.

630
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,957
But she died in a car accident
a few months ago.

631
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,961
She believes
that her daughter is still alive.

632
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:15,173
It must be hard for her to accept it.
For the time being.

633
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:18,093
"Emile couldn't relax.

634
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:21,721
Maybe it was a trap his mother set up
to make him eat chicory.

635
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:23,849
Emile picked his nose."

636
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:25,016
It's me, your mom.

637
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:28,061
-"He wanted to see who the visitor was.
- It's me, your mom.

638
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:30,981
-Emile was invisible to everyone."
- It's me, your mom.

639
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:31,898
Be quiet.

640
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:34,442
"Emile quickly ran out..."

641
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:36,695
It's me, your mom.

642
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:38,280
- It's me, your mom.
-"Welcome.

643
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:40,282
-This is your--"
-I said, be quiet!

644
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:48,915
Goodness.

645
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:51,042
-Why did she yell?
-Why take it out on us?

646
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:52,377
-Jeez.
-Seriously.

647
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,629
Ms. Ko hates me.

648
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,131
She's so mean to me.

649
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,341
I didn't even do anything wrong.

650
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,510
What's wrong?

651
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:03,513
Ms. Ko asked A-reum to read a book aloud.

652
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:06,600
Then she yelled at her to be quiet
when she read.

653
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:07,851
From my experience,

654
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:11,813
I'm sure that she'll be possessed
by a ghost soon.

655
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:15,817
People who hear ghosts talking to them
start talking nonsense like that.

656
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:18,278
Where's Ms. Ko?

657
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:25,952
LEE SANG-IN

658
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:33,001
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

659
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:36,630
All right. Today is the day
I put an end to this once and for all.

660
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,215
But if Ms. Ko finds out,

661
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:40,342
you're finished.

662
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,261
Are you going to be okay?

663
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:46,806
Well, I'm doomed either way.

664
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:49,559
Let's go!

665
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:00,946
I researched and organized

666
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:03,531
the recent trends in children's literature

667
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:06,451
for Mun-yeong to refer to
while working on her next book.

668
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:08,620
I went to an internet café by myself--

669
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:10,455
-Do you want me to pass it along?
-No.

670
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:12,207
I want to give this to her myself.

671
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:15,919
Then why did you want to see me?

672
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,964
I'll get straight to the point.

673
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:20,966
Move out of her house.

674
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:24,761
Both you and your brother.
You two shouldn't be there.

675
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:27,222
Why not?

676
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:32,310
Because that's where I belong.

677
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:34,521
You can't handle her.

678
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:36,189
It's not a job for everyone.

679
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:40,735
I've been enduring everything
and putting up with her for ten years.

680
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:42,946
I've been bending over backwards for her.

681
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:46,324
I've been putting my life and soul
on the line to protect her.

682
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,035
Why? What for?

683
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:53,331
Well, because I truly care about her and--

684
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:54,416
For money?

685
00:54:56,334 --> 00:55:00,005
You've made quite a bit of money
from selling her books, right?

686
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:07,804
Why boast about your sacrifices
when you were rewarded for them?

687
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:10,223
What? I wasn't boasting!

688
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:12,642
Had I considered her
only as a means to make money,

689
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:15,895
I would've deserted her
when my company suffered because of her.

690
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:18,606
Our relationship
isn't just based on monetary gain.

691
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:20,692
It's much more than that!

692
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:23,486
What is it, then?

693
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:27,032
To Mun-yeong,

694
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:31,619
I'm her publisher, mentor, brother,
and her man!

695
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:39,753
Anyway,

696
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:43,757
you're stealing my spot,
so move aside at once.

697
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:49,804
I don't want to.

698
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:52,182
What?

699
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:54,392
I won't move aside.

700
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:59,564
Doesn't that caregiver
seem like a great guy?

701
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:02,275
All the other girls seem to think so too.

702
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,694
There are so many girls who are after him.

703
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:07,989
You have to snatch him soon.

704
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:10,617
You're my only child.

705
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:14,037
It's my lifelong wish to see
the two of you married and living happily

706
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,246
before I pass away.

707
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,916
It's not like I'll live forever.

708
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:19,793
Can't you just do as I say--

709
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:21,586
Ms. Kang.

710
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:24,589
The head nurse
would like to speak with you.

711
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:26,299
With me? Now?

712
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:28,635
-I'm busy now.
-You have to go now.

713
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,762
Hey, let me finish before you go!

714
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:41,773
Why isn't she answering her phone?

715
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:53,368
GANG-TAE

716
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:57,247
Gang-tae!

717
00:56:57,705 --> 00:56:58,540
Come join us.

718
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:04,754
Have a seat.

719
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:08,800
You must be hungry.

720
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:11,594
Gosh.

721
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:16,307
Can you even eat proper meals
in that remote place?

722
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:19,227
I couldn't sleep a wink
because I was so worried.

723
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:20,311
That's why

724
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:24,649
I woke up early and made a few things
with the ingredients I had.

725
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:26,109
Go on and eat up.

726
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:27,402
Okay, thank you.

727
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:29,863
-Here. You too, Sang-tae.
-Thank you.

728
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:31,906
Here, eat up.

729
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:40,165
-Try this.
-Thank you.

730
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:43,793
Gosh.

731
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:46,129
The house feels empty

732
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:48,923
without you guys.

733
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:59,267
Well, Ju-ri.

734
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:04,063
Yes, I heard you have to stay there
for a while because of Sang-tae's work.

735
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:07,484
Congratulations.
I'd like a copy when your book comes out.

736
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:10,195
Well, buy your own copy.

737
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:12,405
You should pay for it with your money.

738
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:13,323
Sang-tae.

739
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:16,618
All right. When your book comes out,

740
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:19,162
-I'll buy 100 copies.
-Thank you.

741
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:22,207
-Eat up.
-Okay.

742
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:34,427
My gosh, I knew that nurse would do this.

743
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:37,388
She's even getting her mom to help her.

744
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:39,432
Don't just leave.

745
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:41,809
Make sure
that skank stays away from him!

746
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:44,270
What did I tell you?

747
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:45,980
I said other girls will snatch him.

748
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:48,441
Don't be so stubborn.
Listen to your mom, please!

749
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:51,903
I've been eyeing him for you,
but that bitch is about to snatch him.

750
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:54,989
Okay, fine. If you don't want
to do the work, I'll do it for you.

751
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:57,951
Is she the only one with a mom?
You have one too!

752
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:59,035
Please!

753
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,041
Please.

754
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:08,628
Stop saying that word, "mom."

755
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:12,674
-What do I say, then? I am your mom.
-My mom

756
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:16,010
is dead.

757
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:20,014
What?

758
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:21,975
I said my mom

759
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:25,144
is dead.

760
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:28,773
Mom.

761
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:34,946
Her skull cracked,
so there was blood everywhere.

762
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:38,825
No. That can't be.

763
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:40,535
Her limbs were all twisted

764
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:43,162
and wobbly.

765
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,290
No, it can't be.

766
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:47,041
The floor

767
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:51,671
is still stained with her blood.

768
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:53,965
No.

769
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:57,510
That can't be.

770
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:00,805
-So ma'am,
-No.

771
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:01,723
please

772
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:04,892
wake up

773
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:08,313
from your dream.

774
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:11,816
No...

775
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,610
No...

776
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,045
What's on the menu today again?

777
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:33,838
Ms. Park!

778
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:36,090
Over there.

779
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,801
-We'll go check. It's okay.
-Okay. My gosh.

780
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:42,472
Ms. Kang.

781
01:00:43,389 --> 01:00:45,433
Ms. Kang.

782
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:47,101
Call Dr. Kwon. Hurry!

783
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:48,019
Yes, ma'am.

784
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:49,687
Ms. Kang.

785
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:08,247
You're not going to eat?

786
01:01:12,877 --> 01:01:14,712
You left your phone at the hospital.

787
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:20,885
Are you asleep?

788
01:02:12,937 --> 01:02:14,063
Is it

789
01:02:17,608 --> 01:02:18,484
really you?

790
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:20,528
You're back?

791
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:18,688
You don't seem to be in a good mood.

792
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:21,023
Mom.

793
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:24,151
Why did Bluebeard

794
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:30,283
kill his wives?

795
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:34,871
Because they didn't listen to him.

796
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:38,457
You have to listen to Mom
at all times, okay?

797
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:40,710
That makes you a good girl, right?

798
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:43,462
Answer me.

799
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:47,550
Yes, I'll listen to you at all times.

800
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:51,470
Good.

801
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:53,514
Good girl.

802
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:57,685
But why did you bring him here?

803
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:41,854
I've warned you

804
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:47,276
that I will also kill the prince
who comes to save you.

805
01:05:57,453 --> 01:05:58,454
Ko Mun-yeong.

806
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:02,416
Ko Mun-yeong.

807
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:09,966
Run.

808
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:11,801
Run.

809
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:13,636
-It's okay, Ko Mun-yeong.
-Run...

810
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:15,471
-Run.
-It was just a dream.

811
01:06:15,554 --> 01:06:16,639
Please run. Go!

812
01:06:17,431 --> 01:06:18,808
Get out at once!

813
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:23,604
Get lost.

814
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:28,317
Leave at once.

815
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:39,662
Okay, I won't leave.

816
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:56,155
My mother always appears in my nightmares.

817
01:07:57,656 --> 01:07:58,783
You shouldn't be here.

818
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:01,327
What are you doing?

819
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:05,664
The body can't lie.
So it cries when it's hurting.

820
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:09,668
But the heart is a liar, so it stays
silent even when it is hurting.

821
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:12,296
I miss Mom.

822
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:15,758
Then what's going on here? Is it a fling?

823
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:18,719
-What is this crap?
-A nightmare doll.

824
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:20,596
How do I look?

825
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:23,182
You did well, Mun-yeong.

826
01:08:26,018 --> 01:08:26,852
Sang-tae.

827
01:08:28,395 --> 01:08:30,648
Have you ever heard
the story of  Bluebeard?

828
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:35,820
BLUEBEARD DRAGGED HIS WIFE
DOWN TO THE BASEMENT

829
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:20,030
AND CUT OFF HER HEAD

830
01:09:48,058 --> 01:09:52,021
AND ONCE AGAIN,
BLUEBEARD WAS ALL ALONE

831
01:09:52,104 --> 01:09:54,273
BLOOPERS

832
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:48,369
