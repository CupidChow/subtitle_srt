CHAPTER 12

2
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,792
Do you want some toast? I made them.

3
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,836
-What do you want on your toast?
-No, it's okay.

4
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,504
While my bestie burned
eight pieces of toast,

5
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:11,548
I did the laundry and cleaned the house.
What a morning!

6
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,424
On the other hand, you were fast asleep.

7
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,427
Why didn't you wake me?

8
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,304
I even slapped your face to wake you up,

9
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,890
but you kept sleeping
like the princess in  Sleeping Beauty .

10
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,725
Princess.

11
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,061
If you want to wake a princess,
you need to kiss her.

12
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:28,439
I did.

13
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:32,694
By the way,

14
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:36,197
shouldn't we name the characters first?

15
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:41,828
-He’s a guy who has no sense of self.
-Okay.

16
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,622
She’s an emotionless princess
who is just like an empty can.

17
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:45,707
Okay.

18
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:49,210
-And he's--
-Those aren't names.

19
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:52,338
Gang-tae and Sang-tae are names.
But what you just said aren't names.

20
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,173
Today's my day off.

21
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,050
They don't need names. That's the trend.

22
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,636
"Trend"? What's that?

23
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,679
You don't need to know.

24
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:02,682
If you guys have time,
do you want to go for a ride later?

25
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:05,310
-Stop asking questions.
-I'm only asking because I'm curious.

26
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,519
Then don't be curious.

27
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,021
Mind your language to your older brother.

28
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,440
-I'm the boss at work.
-Don't abuse your power.

29
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,234
-You can eat all of this yourself.
-No, I can't. It tastes horrible.

30
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,486
-Let me know when you're done.
-Don't get on my nerves.

31
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,156
-What did I do to get on your nerves?
-I'll be in my room.

32
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,616
Are you asking for a fight?

33
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,326
Gang-tae told me that fighting is bad.

34
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,454
-He told us to hold our anger.
-I'm going, okay?

35
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:27,457
We're in a meeting now,
so try to think of their names.

36
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,407
-What are you doing?
-I'm getting ready to go to work.

37
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,869
Today's my day off.

38
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:06,496
So what?

39
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,207
Want to hang out?

40
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,461
Should we go for a ride on Alberto?

41
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,882
Did your number one and two,
Sang-tae and Ms. Ko, reject you?

42
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,884
Is that why you're asking me,
your number three?

43
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,595
Are you upset again?

44
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,722
Gang-tae, want to know something?

45
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,058
What?

46
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,230
You're sly as a fox.

47
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:36,025
Whenever you need me,
you talk to me all serious

48
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,320
and get me all worried
by looking at me with your teary eyes.

49
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,448
But once you get what you need,
you just ignore me right away.

50
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:44,909
You selfish punk.

51
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,621
So do you not want to hang out?

52
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,459
-Do you like me better or Sang-tae?
-You.

53
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:56,754
Then is it me or Ko Mun-yeong?

54
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,881
-You.
- Come to my restaurant.

55
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:05,930
My gosh.

56
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:10,935
"Sly as a fox"?

57
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,314
Ms. Kang.

58
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:16,607
Here.

59
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,944
I heard you have weak knees

60
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,946
because you're always cooking standing up.

61
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,906
Ju-ri told me she's extremely worried.

62
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,116
Here.

63
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,826
When did I say that?

64
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,245
Don't forget to take one every day
for your health.

65
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,705
My goodness.

66
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:33,708
It's okay.
You should give it to your parents.

67
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,462
I already bought them a box.
It's inside the car trunk.

68
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:38,921
I'm going to give it to them today.

69
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,382
Really?

70
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:47,221
My goodness, then I guess
I should take one right now

71
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,849
to thank you for the kind gift.

72
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,434
Yes, of course.

73
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,729
You're way better than my daughter.

74
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,773
Let's see. There.

75
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,777
Are you off to see your parents?

76
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,988
Yes, something came up at home.

77
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,783
I should go to my room.

78
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,203
-Thank you.
-No problem.

79
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,252
It's nothing big.
It's just a monthly event.

80
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:19,921
"A monthly event"?

81
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:25,134
Yes, my dad broke three ribs
and got hospitalized.

82
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,386
My goodness. How? Is he okay?

83
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,471
I'm so sorry to hear that.

84
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,514
He's lying.

85
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,141
Mr. Lee's father is a liar.

86
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,851
He's just like his father

87
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,645
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree

88
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,859
My gosh, that darn brat needs to be quiet.

89
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,444
Did you really just lie to me?

90
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:50,993
The thing is,
whenever a cousin gets married,

91
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,079
my dad gets really jealous

92
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:57,583
and makes me visit him
by making up all sorts of stuff.

93
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,587
Going on a few blind dates

94
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,673
is the least I can do as his son.

95
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,299
So you're going on a blind date today?

96
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,218
Yes, I do it once a month.

97
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,428
That's why it's a monthly event.

98
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,936
-Drive safely.
-Okay.

99
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,398
Well, I'll call you.

100
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,323
He's going to call?

101
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,036
He's totally my type.

102
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,746
-Should I ask for his number?
-No, don't.

103
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,040
Look at him resting his chin on his hand.

104
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,127
-My gosh, this is crazy. Look at him.
-He's so handsome.

105
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,172
-Will you look at that face?
-My goodness.

106
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,510
My dear Ms. Ko.

107
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,805
Just like how ants are drawn to sweets,

108
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:56,434
lots of women are getting ready
to hit on my lonesome friend, Gang-tae.

109
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,979
So I ask of you to quickly visit
my pizzeria.

110
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,814
Damn, get out of the way.

111
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,650
I'm going to kill those darn ants. Move!

112
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,741
Here. You can try all our toppings
with this pizza.

113
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,828
Try the one with sweet pumpkin first.
It's sweet just like you.

114
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,338
It's good.

115
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,843
Want to know something?

116
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,637
When someone's in love,

117
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:36,432
the brain releases vitamins

118
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,684
and makes that person
seem more attractive.

119
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,269
It's "dopamine," not vitamin.

120
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:43,356
Are you showing off
that you work at a hospital?

121
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,526
Neither of us got a good education.
We're like two peas in a pot.

122
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:47,902
It's "pod," not pot.

123
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,744
-You should be careful.
-Of what?

124
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,496
-Of women.
-What?

125
00:08:58,579 --> 00:08:59,580
Women who are eyeing you.

126
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,250
But you should be more careful

127
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,379
of the crazy woman who is after the women
who have their eyes on you.

128
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:07,672
What are you talking about?

129
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:11,509
Welcome.

130
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:17,265
We have tons of pizza boxes
ready for you today.

131
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:18,933
I'm already full.

132
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,271
How did you know I was here?

133
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,661
Weren't you in a meeting with Sang-tae?

134
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,079
How is that important

135
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,956
when you're here surrounded by ants
that are after you?

136
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,753
I shouldn't have prepared so many boxes.

137
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,757
Hurry up and finish your pizza
so we can get out of this ant nest.

138
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,135
I just started eating. Give me a minute.

139
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,178
Goodness.

140
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,055
OK VEGETABLE GARDEN

141
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,890
Hello. Hi.

142
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,475
Hello.

143
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,939
Hello, tree.
It's a beautiful morning, isn't it?

144
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,775
Oh, hello.

145
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:15,197
You guys might not look the same,
but you're all birds.

146
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,074
So don't fight, okay?

147
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,704
You guys are so adorable and kind.
I'll be off now.

148
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,664
Bye, tree.

149
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,083
He's here.

150
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,545
I thought he might not return
because he was upset with me.

151
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:36,594
Ms. Park.

152
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:38,679
You wanted to see me?

153
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,432
I wanted to ask you something.

154
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:42,892
Sure.

155
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,728
Why did you get rid of
Ms. Park Ok-ran's bed already?

156
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,814
-Because she can't come back.
-What do you mean?

157
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,277
Patients who run away
rarely come back of their own will.

158
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,904
And we have a long waiting list.

159
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,408
Let's not do the same
with Mr. Ko Dae-hwan's bed.

160
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,911
Don't call hospice either.

161
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,456
We should let him stay here.

162
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,668
Yes, I already told our staff to do that.

163
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,252
Gosh, that was fast.

164
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:14,757
But sir.

165
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,676
Why do you think

166
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:22,556
Mr. Ko Dae-hwan acted out
when he saw Ms. Park Ok-ran that day?

167
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,851
It's most likely that he had delusions.

168
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,522
I'm guessing he mistook her for his wife.

169
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,148
The writer, Do Hui-jae?

170
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,609
It seems like he hated his wife

171
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,405
-and feared her at the same time.
-Why?

172
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:42,201
Apparently, she killed someone.

173
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,663
Who did she kill?

174
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:48,791
Hello.

175
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,002
-Hey, Sang-tae.
-Good morning, Ms. Park.

176
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,004
-Hi. Sit here.
-Okay.

177
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,674
I'll leave you guys to talk.

178
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,926
-It's nice to see you.
-Yes.

179
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,680
-No!
-I want some, too.

180
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,685
I hate kids and animals.

181
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,938
-Why?
-They're unreasonable,

182
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,356
they whine all the time,

183
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,108
and they always beg for love.

184
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,317
That's why I like them.

185
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,654
They make me care for them
because they're unreasonable.

186
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,949
It's cute to see them whine.

187
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,746
And because they beg for love,
it makes me grow fond of them.

188
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,667
Just like you.

189
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,715
I will not have your kids.

190
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,052
Don't expect that from me.

191
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,472
I don't want to be jealous of my child.

192
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,394
Come here.

193
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,444
Closer.

194
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,289
Not everyone can be a mother, you know.

195
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:11,582
Gosh.

196
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,335
Darn, that punk.

197
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,630
-Wait.
-I want that one.

198
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,549
Min-jae, sit down. Come here and sit.

199
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:25,179
-There you go. Is it yummy?
-Yes.

200
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,097
You eat so well.

201
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:44,782
Are you still upset

202
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,284
that I refused to pay
for a mural with no butterflies?

203
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:50,162
A... A promise isn't something
you can take so lightly.

204
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,873
You need to keep your promise.
That's only the right thing to do.

205
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,921
I just want you to stop

206
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:03,676
running away from butterflies.

207
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,929
Since you've always been running away,

208
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,847
Gang-tae has had to go through
tough times.

209
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,683
But... Butterflies...

210
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,812
I'm scared of them.
I don't like butterflies.

211
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,732
Let me tell you something interesting.

212
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,317
Sure.

213
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:24,321
In ancient Greek,
the word butterfly is  psyche .

214
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:25,906
Psyche ?

215
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,700
Do you know what they symbolized?

216
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,122
-They were a symbol of "cure."
-"Cure."

217
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,166
Not all butterflies are scary.

218
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:40,129
There are many butterflies
that are good and can cure people.

219
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,424
So instead of being so impatient,

220
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:47,261
why don't we both try
and overcome the fear together?

221
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:49,847
"Cure."

222
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,684
If we keep trying,
there might be a butterfly

223
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:58,439
flying around in your mural one day.

224
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,691
Yes. Cure.

225
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:07,948
Cure.

226
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,291
Is your next book going to be based
on my brother's drawing?

227
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,460
Is it about kids going on a trip
in a camping car?

228
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,587
It's about us. The three of us.

229
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,381
Am I the guy with no sense of self?

230
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,592
And are you the emotionless princess?

231
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:27,718
Yes.

232
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,595
Then what about my brother?

233
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,680
He's a guy who's trapped inside a box.

234
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,977
What do they do on that trip?

235
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:44,193
They meet people who are weirder
and a lot more deficient than they are.

236
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,821
-What happens after that?
-That'd be a spoiler. No more.

237
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,243
-It sounds fun.
-Of course.

238
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,579
I'm the writer.

239
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,419
I hope it's going to be
a happy ending this time.

240
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:04,588
Me too.

241
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,265
By the way, where are we going?

242
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,893
To buy bread.
You burned it all this morning.

243
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,145
I see.

244
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:27,236
Look at all this stuff.
I've never been to a place like this.

245
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,405
I want this.

246
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:31,448
Just get one.

247
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,492
I thought about it, and I think

248
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,452
it'd be nice to have a son
who looks like you.

249
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,623
I don't think I'll get jealous.

250
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,417
Let's have a son.

251
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,629
You really need to stop
getting ahead of yourself.

252
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,342
Why? What's wrong? Let's have a son.

253
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,302
Let's have a son! I want a son!

254
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,722
Why won't you cooperate?

255
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,306
I want your cooperation!

256
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,892
-Gosh, be quiet.
-He must not want a baby.

257
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,394
I wonder why he doesn't want one.

258
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,980
I wonder why he won't cooperate.
He looks completely healthy.

259
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,399
Stop talking about having a baby.
Just go and get some milk.

260
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,083
-Ju-ri.
-Yes?

261
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,754
Did you hear?
Dr. Kwon is getting married soon.

262
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:27,921
He wasn't seeing anyone.

263
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,299
He's marrying the woman he met
on a blind date last month.

264
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,426
-That quickly?
-Come on.

265
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,386
When you're at his age,
you just get married

266
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,471
if everything seems okay.

267
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,350
Were you guys talking about me?

268
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,936
Then let me just cut to the chase.

269
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,146
Surprise.

270
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,320
Everything's proceeding so quickly.

271
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:56,867
My ideal type showed up on the blind date.

272
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,211
Should I leave Sang-tae's art supplies
in the study?

273
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:14,426
Let me go.

274
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,429
When are we going to start
using the same room?

275
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,390
Why would I do that?
I sleep with Sang-tae.

276
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,142
Let go of me.

277
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,144
I'm home.

278
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,731
Let go of me right now.

279
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,234
Sang-tae! We're over here!

280
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,029
Okay, fine. Let's hang out later.

281
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,447
In my room?

282
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,616
Yes, in your room.

283
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,496
I'll be waiting for you.

284
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,941
I'll call you.

285
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,126
Yes, Mr. Lee.

286
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,629
We have the overall storyline.

287
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,716
I'll ask Mr. Moon about the illustrations.

288
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:41,388
I came up with a list of places
we can go for research.

289
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,932
It's near the art library.

290
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,603
Okay. Bye, Mr. Lee.

291
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,319
Was that Mr. Lee?

292
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:57,237
Yes.

293
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,032
Did he say anything in particular?

294
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,117
Like what?

295
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:04,953
No, never mind.

296
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:11,919
Mr. Lee's blind date
apparently looked like Song Hye-kyo.

297
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,796
His ideal type of woman
is someone who looks like her.

298
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:19,051
That guy falls in love so easily.
He really got lucky this time.

299
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:25,891
Butterfly is  psyche ,
and it symbolizes "cure."

300
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,684
Butterflies that cure are good.

301
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,313
-Did the director tell you that?
-Yes.

302
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,024
"Stop running away
and face the butterflies

303
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:37,319
so that Gang-tae won't have to go through
tough times anymore."

304
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,446
Do you really think you can do that?

305
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,703
Is... Is this expensive?

306
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,956
How... How much is all this?

307
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,627
Sell lots of books and pay me back.

308
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,046
I'm going to take a shower.

309
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:00,342
Psyche  symbolizes "cure."

310
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:04,054
There are tons of good butterflies.
There are tons of them.

311
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:07,349
There are tons of good butterflies.
Psyche  symbolizes "cure."

312
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,318
No.

313
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,531
I don't need a pillow.
I can lay on his arm.

314
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,009
You came running
without even drying your hair.

315
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,273
Come here and sit down.

316
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,695
You really don't listen.

317
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,822
This is a lot of alcohol.

318
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,686
My brother started getting counseling--

319
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,022
I forbid you to talk about your brother.

320
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,398
If you do, drink an entire glass.

321
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,735
Then you can't cuss.

322
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:43,904
If you do, drink an entire glass.

323
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:44,821
Deal.

324
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:48,325
Shit, my damn head hurts like hell.

325
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,452
Why am I so freaking dizzy? Damn it.

326
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,665
Look at you swear.

327
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,920
You should go to bed.

328
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:10,639
I'm...

329
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:14,726
so happy.

330
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:21,775
I'm so happy that you and Sang-tae

331
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:26,488
live here with me now.

332
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:01,940
Good night.

333
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,472
I WILL COME FOR YOU SOON

334
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,062
No, I'm talking about Ms. Park Ok-ran.

335
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:24,314
Why did she go there?

336
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,192
There's no way she escaped

337
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:30,153
just to wish Ms. Ko a happy birthday.

338
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:43,250
The butterfly said it'd kill me as well.

339
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,627
It'll kill me!

340
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,420
Those butterflies!

341
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,005
They said they'll kill me.

342
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,383
The butterflies will kill me!

343
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,843
They're coming to kill me!

344
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:04,396
I WILL COME FOR YOU SOON

345
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:57,759
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

346
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:04,641
My gosh, I hope you spend
a longer time outside this time.

347
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,018
Don't come back in just a few hours.

348
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:10,397
Don't worry. I'll see you later.

349
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,775
-You should eat a lot of delicious stuff.
-Okay.

350
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,407
I bet he's just going to get on a bus

351
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,200
and come back after circling around a bit.

352
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,035
Yes, probably.

353
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:27,831
But how did he end up
doing something like that

354
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,624
when he can't even kill an ant?

355
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,837
-What do you mean?
-Mr. Kan told me everything.

356
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,339
He told me he killed so many people.

357
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,174
Is that why he went crazy?

358
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,719
He's such a weak and kind person.

359
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:45,765
It wasn't something he could handle.

360
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,382
Turn off the gas stove

361
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,134
to save money.

362
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,178
We need to save gas to save money.

363
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:26,598
I forgot.

364
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:29,851
Your... Your eyes are red.

365
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,520
Did... Did you not sleep well?
You have the eyes of a rabbit.

366
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,565
No, I slept well.

367
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,863
You have counseling today, right?

368
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:45,617
Yes... Yes, I have counseling.
I... I have counseling today.

369
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,537
Butterfly is  psyche ,
and it symbolizes "cure."

370
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:52,624
It symbolizes "cure"...

371
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,213
But I'm still scared of them.

372
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,927
What... What if the butterfly
appears again?

373
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,845
We'll... We'll have to move again.

374
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:13,478
Sang-tae.

375
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,523
Let's stop

376
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,651
running away.

377
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:21,694
But the butterflies...

378
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,615
You know that I'm good at fighting, right?

379
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:27,575
Yes, you're a great fighter.

380
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,536
You have a red belt in taekwondo.

381
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,746
You beat up all the kids who bullied me
with your kicks.

382
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,498
You're also good at using your nails.

383
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:39,838
So from now on, if you're scared,
just hide behind me.

384
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:44,300
But... But I'm your big brother.
I'm an adult.

385
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:45,760
If I hide behind my little brother,

386
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,637
that would make me... What's it called?

387
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,721
A scaredy-cat?

388
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,141
It's okay.

389
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:56,062
I've been hiding behind you all my life.

390
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,314
Behind me?

391
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,835
Hey, babe.

392
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,754
Grilled meat? Sounds great.

393
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:23,464
Tonight?

394
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:27,302
Why did he have to say he'll call?
I can't stop looking at my phone.

395
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,220
-Ms. Nam.
-Yes?

396
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:32,432
Mr. Ko is slowly starting to recover
his cognitive orientation.

397
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:35,018
-So take him for a short walk.
-Okay, ma'am.

398
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,937
Oh, right.
Is Mr. Moon working the day shift today?

399
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,606
Yes, he got here a few minutes ago.

400
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,870
I WILL COME FOR YOU SOON

401
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,165
Mr. Moon.

402
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,502
What? What is that?

403
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:04,797
Did you receive
a love letter or something?

404
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,382
-Come on. Show me.
-It's nothing.

405
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:08,801
What's the matter?

406
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,889
Oh, you see...

407
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:16,476
I went into room 201 while doing
my rounds earlier in the morning

408
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,355
and found a dangerous item in the room.

409
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:24,192
Gosh. I have to say,
Mr. O Cha-yong always does

410
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:27,445
such a clumsy job when he's checking
the patients' belongings, doesn't he?

411
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:29,906
I'm sorry.

412
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,824
I'll train him better.

413
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:36,204
Can you do another thorough check
on the rooms on the second floor, then?

414
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,373
-Sure, no problem.
-Here.

415
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:42,877
You must be getting tired.

416
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,046
Would you like to sit down for a moment?

417
00:32:58,518 --> 00:32:59,602
Will I

418
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,107
die soon?

419
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,778
Have I been

420
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:11,906
punished enough?

421
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:24,168
"Years went by,
and the boy became an adult.

422
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,503
He no longer had nightmares.

423
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:28,923
But for some strange reason,
he wasn't happy at all.

424
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,383
One night--"

425
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:31,509
Headed to the hospital?

426
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:33,261
Yes. Hello!

427
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:36,973
Oh, you're wearing
something different today. Nice clothes.

428
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:39,851
-Yes, I am.
-You look very young today.

429
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:42,895
By the way, how old are you?

430
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,897
Me? I'm 70.

431
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:49,110
You're 70? You're older than me.
You're an adult.

432
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,528
I am an adult indeed.

433
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:53,865
Being an adult isn't always great.

434
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,783
Right, I agree.

435
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:57,910
-Oh, look!
-Do you want this?

436
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,495
Thank you.

437
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:04,500
Right, the mural.

438
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:05,835
It looks amazing.

439
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:09,464
It's amazing. It looks super cool.

440
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:13,885
But Director O Ji-wang wouldn't pay me
because I refused to draw butterflies.

441
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:16,220
He is not a man of his word.

442
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:19,057
Why can't you just draw some butterflies?

443
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,227
I'm scared of butterflies.

444
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,145
Why?

445
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:27,273
Do you have a bad memory
of butterflies or something?

446
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:37,075
Don't let the past trap you,

447
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,159
or you'll end up like me.

448
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,536
Look at me.

449
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,497
I can't go back out into the world.

450
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,916
I'll always be stuck in the hospital.

451
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:47,752
The past can trap me?

452
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,212
Yes.

453
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,965
Then I can just open the door and get out.

454
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:55,134
No, you can't.

455
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,220
You won't be able to see the door.

456
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:03,267
You can't get out
once you're trapped in the past.

457
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,645
Don't end up like me.

458
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:27,935
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

459
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:29,645
Do your ears hurt?

460
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,147
God, that sound...

461
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:34,567
-Is that sound bothering you?
-That sound...

462
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:37,904
This sound? This sound...

463
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:01,969
Sir! What's wrong?

464
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,057
Are you okay, sir?

465
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,893
It's okay. You're okay.

466
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:10,728
You're okay. It's all right.

467
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:13,731
Could you please call
OK Psychiatric Hospital right away?

468
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:15,483
You're okay. You're safe.

469
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:18,694
You're okay. It's all right.

470
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,864
You're okay. You're okay now.

471
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,824
Count to three in your head.

472
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,703
You're okay. You're okay now.

473
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,748
You're okay. It's all right.

474
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:34,085
You're safe, okay? Everything's okay now.

475
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,260
Director O.

476
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,887
Can you just kill me?

477
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:47,139
Don't you worry.

478
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,766
You'll die anyway.

479
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:54,647
All of us here, including myself,
will die eventually anyway.

480
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,524
Don't be so anxious.

481
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,823
It's okay. Try to relax.

482
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:13,958
-What's up?
-Well, this...

483
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,168
I'd like to

484
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,170
lend this book to him.

485
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,589
-Really?
-I'm not giving it to him though.

486
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,633
He can borrow it.
I paid a lot of money for it,

487
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,093
so it's mine.

488
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:26,679
Okay, he can borrow and read it.

489
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:27,930
Yes, I'm lending it to him.

490
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,647
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

491
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,399
Come in.

492
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:43,988
I must say, he sure is your big brother.

493
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:49,076
Without Sang-tae's help, Mr. Kan
would've gotten in a dangerous situation.

494
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,288
I am your big brother.

495
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,415
Have a seat.

496
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:58,794
Good job.

497
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:02,506
Remember what you told me earlier?

498
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,551
-Can you also tell your brother?
-Sure.

499
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,470
What is it about?

500
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:11,140
Mr. Kan told me
that I shouldn't end up like him.

501
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,603
He said you can never get out

502
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,521
once you're trapped in the past

503
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:20,149
because you can't even see the door.

504
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,319
A trauma?

505
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:24,820
Yes.

506
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,198
He fought in the Vietnam War
when he was only 20.

507
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:31,327
It left him with traumatic memories.

508
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,999
There were a lot of kids.

509
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:39,919
Kids

510
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:44,423
with sparkling eyes.

511
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,718
They were adorable.

512
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,725
I just couldn't bring myself
to look at them,

513
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,560
so I...

514
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,563
closed my eyes.

515
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:01,524
Then I...

516
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:07,822
I killed all those innocent people.

517
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:11,492
I don't even know why I'm still alive.

518
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:14,495
You were just following an order.

519
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:16,414
You had no choice.

520
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:19,708
You're nothing more than a beast
if you blindly follow such orders.

521
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:21,877
A human being with a heart
would never do that.

522
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,632
I shouldn't even call myself human.

523
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,849
THE BOY WHO FED ON NIGHTMARES

524
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:37,518
"So don't forget any of it.

525
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,979
Remember it all and overcome it.

526
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,440
If you don't overcome it,

527
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:46,944
you'll always be a kid
whose soul never grows."

528
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:51,574
I'm not a kid. I'm an adult.

529
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,455
Sang-tae.

530
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:00,791
Yes, I won't run away anymore.

531
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,626
I will not run away.

532
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,420
-My gosh.
-That's right.

533
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,339
You're incredibly brave, Sang-tae.

534
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,299
That's right.

535
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:11,635
Then would you be able to tell us

536
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:15,681
what you remember about that day?

537
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:21,312
Yes.

538
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,357
Well...

539
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:31,655
That day...

540
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:32,781
-I--
-Kitty!

541
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,367
That night...

542
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:39,455
Well...

543
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,665
SEONGJIN WELFARE CENTER

544
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:44,585
I have to work late from now on,

545
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,879
so you'll have to go home with Gang-tae.

546
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,131
Okay?

547
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,175
Look, it's a cat.

548
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:52,468
Kitty!

549
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:57,014
Sang-tae, get back here.
You shouldn't go in there.

550
00:41:58,098 --> 00:41:59,892
Get back here, Sang-tae!

551
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,020
Fine. I'm leaving.

552
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:05,105
I'm leaving without you.

553
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,652
Bye.

554
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,821
Bye, Sang-tae!

555
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,001
Kitty.

556
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:27,753
Kitty?

557
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,283
I didn't get to say this earlier.

558
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,620
It is me

559
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,332
who will take care of my child.

560
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:04,266
My gosh, why do you look so scared?

561
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,394
It's okay.

562
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:09,772
It's all right.

563
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:20,157
Yes, good boy.

564
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:25,579
Do not tell anyone

565
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,208
about what you saw or heard here.

566
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:34,213
If you do, I'll kill you.

567
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:39,093
Even if you run away,

568
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:43,972
I will chase you down no matter what
and make sure

569
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,768
I kill you.

570
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:51,188
The... The butterfly killed Mom.

571
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,023
Okay?

572
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:58,695
Answer me.

573
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,116
I said, answer me!

574
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:11,834
There was... There was a butterfly
on that woman's jacket.

575
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:14,920
There was a butterfly
sitting on her jacket.

576
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:16,922
"Her jacket"?

577
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,801
That butterfly...

578
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,887
Do you remember what it looked like?

579
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:25,639
Yes.

580
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:30,102
Yes, I do remember.

581
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,649
Well...

582
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:39,027
Gosh.

583
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:50,914
Actually,

584
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:54,293
there was a mom butterfly.

585
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:59,423
And I saw a tiny baby butterfly

586
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,717
sitting on the mom butterfly's back.

587
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:03,969
It was sitting on its back?

588
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:14,021
Yes, there were two...
I saw two butterflies.

589
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:18,817
The mom and the baby. Two butterflies.

590
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:35,501
I think that's why we're meant to be.

591
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,253
If someone shows up when you need them,

592
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,672
you call that destiny.

593
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:43,509
And I

594
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:45,552
need you.

595
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:55,395
I hope it's going to be

596
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:57,940
a happy ending this time.

597
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:02,170
Your book is quite engaging.

598
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:03,297
Yes, I know.

599
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:14,600
You heard about your father, right?

600
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:18,645
How much time does he have left?

601
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:22,899
Let me rephrase that.

602
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:27,237
When will he die?

603
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:32,659
I wouldn't be surprised
even if he passed away tomorrow.

604
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:38,206
I'm sick of doctors telling me
the same thing over and over.

605
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:43,587
You know,

606
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:46,548
if you're okay with it,

607
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:52,471
why don't we take your father out
for a walk when you have some time?

608
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:54,848
-Ju-ri.
-Yes?

609
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:00,145
I...

610
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:04,358
don't want to.

611
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:17,537
Yes.

612
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,831
So I took off my shirt right away
and put it over his head

613
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,708
like Gang-tae does for me all the time.

614
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:25,587
Then he stopped screaming and calmed down.

615
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:26,797
My gosh.

616
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:29,758
Great job, Sang-tae.

617
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:31,301
I'm so proud of you.

618
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:32,260
I know.

619
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:34,805
Yes, the cafeteria. I'm at the cafeteria.

620
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:36,348
So I...

621
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:39,393
Where was I?

622
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:43,021
Anyway, I asked someone to call
OK Psychiatric Hospital

623
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,648
and came here with him in the ambulance.

624
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:48,860
There's a storybook that I like.
It's called  The Boy Who Fed on Nightmares .

625
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:50,862
-I lent him that book.
-My, how sweet.

626
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:52,364
He can't keep the book though.

627
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:54,741
I paid a lot of money for it,
so I can't let him keep it.

628
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:58,328
Anyhow, he kept thanking me.

629
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:00,539
He said he's grateful to me.
He's grateful.

630
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:01,790
-Absolutely.
-Yes.

631
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:02,749
Sang-tae.

632
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:06,211
Let's wait for Gang-tae
and go home together.

633
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:11,007
Ko Mun-yeong, she's a lot older than you.
You need to say hello to her first.

634
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:15,345
Hello.

635
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:17,514
Yes, hi.

636
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,851
Shall we eat out? It's been a while.

637
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:23,478
No, I want to eat at home.

638
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:25,105
We shouldn't be eating out.

639
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:28,316
We have to save money to live better.

640
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:32,237
It looks as though

641
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,448
the three of you are actually a family.

642
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,616
I'm getting jealous here.

643
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,703
No. Strictly speaking, we're not a family.

644
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:42,998
Gang-tae and I have the same surname,
Moon, whereas she...

645
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:44,833
What was your surname? Right, Ko.

646
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:46,126
Ko and Moon.

647
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:48,378
Different surnames.
And she's not on our family register.

648
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:53,425
We're not a real family,
but we're like a family.

649
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:56,344
-The family register isn't everything.
-What?

650
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:57,554
A family is...

651
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:06,813
-A family is...
-Yes?

652
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,442
You become one
if you take a portrait together.

653
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:13,111
What? A family portrait?

654
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:15,781
That's right. Forget the family register.

655
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:18,033
A family portrait is the proof
that you're a family.

656
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:24,998
The two of you are so much alike.

657
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:32,839
Our eyes... Do our eyes look alike?

658
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:36,051
No, we don't look alike at all.

659
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:39,888
I can't pinpoint it,
but I think there's some resemblance.

660
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:41,640
You're wrong. I'm very pretty.

661
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,518
Don't lie, Ko Mun-yeong.

662
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:48,396
You cut... You cut your hair.

663
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:58,615
What time do you get off work?

664
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:03,829
What happened to your hand?

665
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:06,665
I hurt it while working.

666
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:08,959
Who's the jerk that did this to you?

667
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:10,210
Who did this?

668
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:14,214
I'm asking you who did it.

669
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:25,433
What's going on?

670
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:27,769
Are you mad at me?

671
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:33,441
Am I going bonkers again
without being considerate

672
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:34,985
of your feelings

673
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,736
like an empty can?

674
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:45,078
I'm just tired.

675
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:48,832
I didn't get much sleep last night.

676
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:58,049
Go home with Sang-tae.

677
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,385
I have to work the night shift as well.

678
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:04,639
Really?
Then you'll probably be off tomorrow.

679
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:05,557
That's great.

680
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,393
The two of us and Sang-tae
should take a family portrait tomorrow.

681
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:20,071
I already made an appointment
at a fancy photo studio.

682
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:23,074
We should stop by a tailor shop on the way
and buy a couple of suits.

683
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,453
Maybe another time.

684
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:29,372
-What?
-Let's do it some other day.

685
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:32,208
-Not tomorrow.
-But I already made an appointment.

686
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:35,003
-Cancel it.
-No, I don't want to.

687
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:36,963
Let's not put it off
and just do it tomorrow.

688
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,966
We have to take a family portrait together
to become a real family.

689
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,301
Leave!

690
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:47,849
Please.

691
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:50,101
Just leave.

692
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:54,648
Please.

693
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:00,403
I have to work.

694
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:52,497
I'm going to take a photo!
I have to look cool.

695
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:55,625
One... One, two, three.

696
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:01,589
One, two, three. Look cool.

697
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:04,092
One, two, three.

698
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:15,270
What do I do to look cool?
One, two, three.

699
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,065
Jeez, why the heck is he mad at me again?

700
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:20,608
I mean, just why?

701
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:24,904
Darn it. Yesterday was so nice.

702
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:27,907
We drank together all night.

703
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:31,411
Did I do something silly when I was drunk?

704
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:36,458
Why is he angry? Just why?

705
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:39,711
Was that a soliloquy or a question for me?

706
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:42,422
I'm asking because
I can't quite figure it out.

707
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:46,092
Did you order ten boxes of pizza
at this late hour

708
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,303
just to make me come all the way here

709
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:50,263
because you wanted to know why he's angry?

710
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:51,639
It's obviously not because

711
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:54,350
I wanted to eat ten boxes of pizza
in the middle of the night.

712
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:56,644
Why?

713
00:55:57,145 --> 00:55:58,605
Why is Gang-tae upset?

714
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:00,565
You must know since you're his bestie.

715
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:17,749
He never really opens up to anyone.

716
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:23,129
Do you know how I've managed
to stay close to him all these years?

717
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:27,801
By having no idea of

718
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:31,846
what goes on in his mind
or how he really feels.

719
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:38,061
You see, Gang-tae is an expert
at hiding his feelings.

720
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:42,273
Nothing good will come out of
prying and forcing him

721
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:44,567
to share his feelings and thoughts.

722
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:47,904
All you can do is just be there for him

723
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:50,365
and try to comfort him quietly.

724
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:54,410
That is

725
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:57,288
all I do.

726
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:05,630
Obviously, he's never
even had a chance to whine

727
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:07,173
or complain to his parents.

728
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:10,718
He got so used to just putting up
with things and keeping it all inside.

729
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,139
Then one day,
he realized he'd become an adult.

730
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,103
But he's still a kid inside,
so how would you understand

731
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:22,730
his feelings and thoughts?

732
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:26,151
Even parents can't fully understand
their own child.

733
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:55,638
ROMEO AND JULIET

734
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:04,939
We look like Romeo and Juliet.

735
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:08,067
You're right. The ill-fated mortal enemies

736
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:10,445
who should've never crossed paths.

737
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,448
No, they were meant to be. It was fate.

738
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:15,533
It was tragic fate.

739
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:18,661
ROMEO AND JULIET

740
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:38,806
Your hand didn't do anything wrong.

741
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:42,393
Your heart is the problem
because you can't control it.

742
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:47,190
Sir.

743
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:48,650
Yes?

744
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,362
I think the "butterfly"
that killed my mom was...

745
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:59,661
Mun-yeong's mother.

746
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:02,288
Are you sure?

747
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:03,790
The possibility that it may be true

748
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:08,127
scares me.

749
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:11,798
I hope I'm wrong.

750
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:16,886
No, I wish I had stayed in the dark.

751
00:59:23,434 --> 00:59:25,103
Isn't it just too cruel?

752
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:29,899
I was beginning
to feel like I could finally

753
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:32,902
breathe a little.

754
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,156
I was finally

755
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:41,536
starting to get the urge to live

756
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:46,874
just like everyone else.

757
00:59:51,796 --> 00:59:54,132
Because of that damn butterfly,

758
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:59,762
I've had to

759
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:04,058
crawl and suffer all these years.

760
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:08,104
But how could that butterfly be

761
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:14,444
her mother?

762
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:28,750
I always thought

763
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:33,838
I'd tear the butterfly to shreds
if I ever crossed paths with it,

764
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:38,259
but I can't even do that anymore.

765
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:43,389
I feel so guilty when I think

766
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:45,767
about my mom and my brother.

767
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:49,896
What do I do?

768
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:55,985
I promised my brother
that I'd fight the butterfly

769
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:57,695
in his place.

770
01:01:00,281 --> 01:01:01,491
I...

771
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:06,287
I told him that we shouldn't run away.

772
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:13,336
This is so messed up.

773
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,385
I just want to run away.

774
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:48,162
I don't want Mun-yeong
to suffer like this,

775
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:52,375
so I hope

776
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:57,588
she never finds out about this.

777
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:03,010
I don't want her to be hurt.

778
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:11,102
I don't want her to ever care
about other people's feelings.

779
01:02:13,312 --> 01:02:15,022
I hope she can just live without emotions

780
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:19,277
like an empty can.

781
01:03:14,582 --> 01:03:19,212
I'm so happy that you and Sang-tae

782
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:23,841
live here with me now.

783
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:27,929
I used to

784
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:31,557
hate this place so much.

785
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:36,062
Why?

786
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:40,399
Because my dad lost his sanity here

787
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:43,903
and my mom

788
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:47,281
died in this very house.

789
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:53,120
Blood kept gushing out

790
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:57,375
from her head.

791
01:04:00,878 --> 01:04:03,339
And my dad locked her up

792
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:07,426
in the basement.

793
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:12,515
But the thing is,

794
01:04:15,434 --> 01:04:17,353
she vanished after that.

795
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:20,565
My mom vanished.

796
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,611
She vanished?

797
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:28,030
Yes.

798
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:31,993
I don't know if she actually died

799
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:36,289
or if she just disappeared.

800
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:40,418
I guess only my dad knows the truth.

801
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:45,131
If...

802
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:48,759
If your mom comes back,

803
01:04:51,095 --> 01:04:52,597
how do you think you'll feel?

804
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:56,976
I'll be terrified.

805
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:00,688
And I'll feel suffocated.

806
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:03,399
But you know,

807
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:08,404
she is

808
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:11,949
still my mom.

809
01:06:38,577 --> 01:06:39,787
-Is he coming?
-No.

810
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:42,164
He won't wake up.

811
01:06:42,748 --> 01:06:45,209
He won't even answer me.

812
01:06:45,292 --> 01:06:47,253
He's just sleeping
with the blanket over his head.

813
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:50,047
He's such a sleepyhead. A sleepyhead.

814
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:58,055
I guess he's tired.

815
01:06:58,180 --> 01:06:59,765
Sang-tae, let's take it another day.

816
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:02,435
But I'm...
I'm wearing my nice clothes today.

817
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:05,688
And I got up at 6:50 a.m.,
which is so early. Very early.

818
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:06,981
I even styled my hair with wax.

819
01:07:07,064 --> 01:07:09,316
And yesterday... Last night...

820
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:12,278
I practiced so many cool poses last night.

821
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:15,197
What do I do?

822
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:17,199
What do I do?

823
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:22,496
-Let's go, Sang-tae.
-What?

824
01:07:23,664 --> 01:07:25,958
Let's just go and take some photos
for the book, then.

825
01:07:27,668 --> 01:07:29,420
Yes, photos.

826
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:30,546
Let's take photos.

827
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:31,964
Yes.

828
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:39,638
GANG-TAE

829
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:42,767
PHOTO STUDIO ADDRESS

830
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:14,423
-Hello!
-Hello.

831
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:15,508
Hello.

832
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:54,547
Are you okay?

833
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:56,215
Are you in a bad mood today?

834
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:57,967
I'm always in a bad mood.

835
01:08:58,050 --> 01:08:59,176
Don't worry about me.

836
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:02,763
Will my photo really be included
in the book?

837
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:05,266
Yes, of course. You're the illustrator.

838
01:09:05,349 --> 01:09:07,017
Right, I am.

839
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:11,397
I practiced so many cool poses last night.

840
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,065
-You did?
-Yes.

841
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:14,358
Then show me.

842
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:18,112
One, two, three.

843
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:25,870
One, two... One, two, three!

844
01:09:32,793 --> 01:09:33,711
Sang-tae.

845
01:09:34,295 --> 01:09:35,212
Yes?

846
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:36,881
That's all fake.

847
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:48,058
You don't need to try so hard.

848
01:09:49,226 --> 01:09:51,604
Just relax and be yourself.

849
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:55,149
That's the real Moon Sang-tae.

850
01:09:57,526 --> 01:09:58,819
"The real...

851
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,156
Moon Sang-tae"?

852
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:04,074
Yes.

853
01:10:04,658 --> 01:10:06,660
"The real Moon Sang-tae"?

854
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:20,758
The lady can sit on the chair.

855
01:10:20,841 --> 01:10:22,551
Sir, please stand next to her.

856
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:26,347
Great. Sir, could you stand
a little closer to her?

857
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:28,557
-Sure.
-Nice. That's perfect.

858
01:10:28,807 --> 01:10:31,352
Now, look at the camera
and give me a big smile.

859
01:10:31,435 --> 01:10:34,688
A big smile, please.
Eyes on the camera. Here we go!

860
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:37,191
-One, two--
-Oh, look!

861
01:10:37,274 --> 01:10:38,817
Wait. Just a second, please.

862
01:10:40,277 --> 01:10:43,322
My brother... My little brother is here.

863
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:48,202
My gosh, my brother...
That's my real brother.

864
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:29,535
I'm not

865
01:11:32,204 --> 01:11:33,372
too late, right?

866
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:57,688
Since it's for a family portrait,
please give me a big smile.

867
01:11:57,771 --> 01:11:58,939
Here we go.

868
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:00,441
Please smile.

869
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:02,234
Okay, here we go.

870
01:12:02,484 --> 01:12:05,362
One, two, three!

871
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:58,999
Ko Mun-yeong.

872
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:02,461
If I ask you
to live somewhere else with me,

873
01:13:03,295 --> 01:13:04,380
will you come with me?

874
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:05,422
If

875
01:13:06,006 --> 01:13:08,133
I were born as your mom's daughter,

876
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:10,386
and if you were born
as my dad's daughter...

877
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:13,180
My mom would beat you up to death
for being rude.

878
01:13:14,973 --> 01:13:16,350
Don't trust anyone.

879
01:13:18,143 --> 01:13:19,395
I don't care who it is.

880
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:22,147
I will not forgive
anyone who messes with my family.

881
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:23,941
Am I

882
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:26,693
part of that family?

883
01:13:31,532 --> 01:13:33,534
