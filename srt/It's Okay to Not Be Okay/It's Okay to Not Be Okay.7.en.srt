1
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:46,523
Ko Mun-yeong.

2
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:50,527
Ko Mun-yeong.

3
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,118
Run.

4
00:01:58,743 --> 00:01:59,661
Run.

5
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,955
-It's okay, Ko Mun-yeong.
-Run...

6
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,581
-Please run. Go!
-It was just a dream.

7
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,083
Please run. Go!

8
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,502
Get out at once!

9
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:11,756
Get lost.

10
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,511
Leave at once.

11
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,939
Okay, I won't leave.

12
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,498
Why are you here?

13
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,378
-You were burning up all night.
-So?

14
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,963
You laid me down and played doctor?

15
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,636
Just stay in bed.

16
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,222
I'll drop Sang-tae off at his work
and pick up medicine.

17
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,806
I didn't do anything wrong.

18
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,852
That woman kept acting
as if she were my mom,

19
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,104
so I told her that my mom died.
That's all.

20
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,942
Right, okay.

21
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:15,380
CHAPTER 7
THE CHEERFUL DOG

22
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,007
Seongjin, Seongjin... Seongjin Plaza.

23
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,051
Michuri Public Health Center.

24
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,594
Seongjin, Seongjin... Seongjin Plaza.

25
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,137
Michuri Public Health Center.

26
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:27,100
Hiking... Hiking Trail Entrance.
Oeryong Bridge.

27
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,935
Stop memorizing that.
Go wash up, Sang-tae.

28
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:35,066
I'll take you to Jae-su's restaurant.
Let's head out together.

29
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,568
I can go on my own. On my own.

30
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,237
I know.

31
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,697
But I have to go downtown too.

32
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,659
You don't have to go
to the hospital today?

33
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,079
I'm going to

34
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:50,790
skip work today.

35
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,838
- You can't leave like this.
-Rewind a little.

36
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,172
Okay.

37
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,324
The patient may go through conversion
and stop deluding herself,

38
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:28,661
so let's keep an eye on her
and see what happens.

39
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,829
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

40
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:31,664
Sir.

41
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:35,251
I think you have to take this up
with Ms. Ko Mun-yeong as well.

42
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,921
First, let's find out
what she said to the patient.

43
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,258
I bet she said something like,
"Your daughter is dead."

44
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,052
So she fainted from the emotional shock.

45
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,553
How would Ms. Ko know about that?

46
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:48,973
Maybe Mr. Moon told her.

47
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,560
-They're close, you know.
-No, they're not.

48
00:05:56,814 --> 00:06:00,068
You all know that he'd never disclose
any patient information.

49
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:07,116
Anyway, we've been having problems nonstop

50
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,452
ever since Ms. Ko started coming
to our hospital.

51
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,245
We need to do something about this.

52
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,747
Yes.

53
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,207
I agree.

54
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,792
Me too.

55
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,801
Could you please stop scraping off
your dandruff and make a decision?

56
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,513
Let's put her fairy tale class on pause

57
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,599
until we find out what really happened.

58
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,351
-Okay.
-Okay.

59
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:34,936
Would that be all?

60
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:37,605
Tell Mr. Moon
that I'd like to speak with him.

61
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,398
He didn't come in today.

62
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,859
He called earlier and said
that something came up at home.

63
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:43,653
Oh, really?

64
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,875
Sang-tae, how do you feel
about quitting the job

65
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,378
at Jae-su's restaurant?

66
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,757
You've been doing so many things
ever since we moved here.

67
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,511
Drawing the mural at the hospital

68
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,179
and selling pizza at Jae-su's restaurant.

69
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,056
When you start
working on the illustrations...

70
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,435
You'll be too busy.

71
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,562
Being busy isn't a bad thing.

72
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,606
Right, it's not a bad thing.

73
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,526
But if you're too busy,
you might fall ill.

74
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:26,737
-You may ache all over--
-Like a dog.

75
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:28,656
What?

76
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:31,159
You whimper like a dog at night
when you're ill.

77
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:35,037
I don't do that, but you always
whimper like a dog when you sleep.

78
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:39,792
Hello.

79
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,006
What? I do that?

80
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:47,675
That's odd.

81
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,344
I'm not ill.

82
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,430
I no longer work multiple jobs,

83
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,266
so I feel perfectly fine.

84
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,727
It's because your heart is aching.

85
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,105
"Your body is honest.

86
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,816
When you're in physical pain, you cry.

87
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:09,614
But the heart is a liar.
It stays quiet even when it's hurting.

88
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,366
Then when you're asleep,

89
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:16,162
you finally weep and whimper like a dog."

90
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,133
You like this book that much?

91
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:33,137
Yes,  The Cheerful Dog  by Ms. Ko Mun-yeong.

92
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,639
"Written by Ko Mun-yeong.

93
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,099
Once upon a time..."

94
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,397
Oh, we're not open yet...

95
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,820
You jerk! You moved in with her
without discussing it with me.

96
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,280
Did you think I'd be happy to--

97
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,243
Hello?

98
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,370
Yes.

99
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,455
Let's talk later.

100
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,166
-Right.
-Later? When?

101
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,669
Hey! I'll be waiting, okay? Hey!

102
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,004
-Hi, Jae-su.
-Goodness!

103
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,715
Jeez. Hi, Sang-tae.

104
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,885
She's not feeling well.

105
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:17,181
Come on. When did she start
feeling unwell? And what are the symptoms?

106
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:20,142
I need details!

107
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,271
She's not answering my calls.
I'm getting a bad feeling.

108
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,773
- I was worried all night--
-I'll tell her to give you a call.

109
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,650
I have to go.

110
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,194
GEUKJIN PHARMACY

111
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:36,367
I can't believe
he hung up on me like that.

112
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:40,037
Gosh, that heartless prick.

113
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:41,497
Right?

114
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:45,960
He would be way more attractive
if he was more relaxed.

115
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,004
He's too uptight. What a shame.

116
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,172
But physically, he's totally my type.

117
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:56,679
You have to tiptoe around me
every single day,

118
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,931
yet you're still so dull-witted.
How's that possible?

119
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:04,604
Right? Had I been quick-witted,

120
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,398
I wouldn't have trusted you
and come all the way here.

121
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,191
Sorry about that.

122
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,485
It's all my fault.

123
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,490
I have to go check in on Mun-yeong.

124
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,577
Settle up with this

125
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:24,081
and get a latte or something
at a cafe somewhere.

126
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,253
See you later, sir!

127
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,888
That son of a bitch.

128
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,851
Maybe I should side with Ko Mun-young.

129
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,354
He that would eat the fruit
must climb the tree.

130
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,782
Mamma mia!

131
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,922
MR. LEE

132
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:25,393
Long hair suits you
because you take after me.

133
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,270
Never cut your hair short.

134
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,064
But I'm tired of it.

135
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,735
You have to listen to Mom, right?

136
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,071
Answer me.

137
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,868
Answer me!

138
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:45,996
Yes,

139
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:48,958
Mom.

140
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:08,686
Please...

141
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,564
Save me!

142
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,004
Mun-yeong.

143
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,798
Are you okay?

144
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,092
I want to cut it,

145
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,554
but I just can't.

146
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,015
Cut what?

147
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,434
My mom.

148
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:55,691
Did you get sleep paralysis again

149
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,444
because of that hallucination?

150
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,614
Since when?

151
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,034
When did you start
experiencing them again?

152
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:11,790
The first day back here.

153
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:19,590
You can't stay here.
I'm taking you back to Seoul now.

154
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:22,843
I'm warning you.
Do not touch any of my stuff.

155
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,262
Then let me warn you as well!

156
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,556
I'm going to knock you out if I must,

157
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,099
so don't stop me.

158
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:32,019
I know that you'll be destroyed

159
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,188
if those hallucinations
start haunting you again.

160
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,524
So I absolutely cannot let you stay here.

161
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,067
I've had a bad feeling ever since

162
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:41,695
you talked about those red shoes
and moved here with that caregiver guy.

163
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,365
You two should've never gotten involved--

164
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,120
I've known you for ten years.

165
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:52,873
I at least know this much.

166
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,214
-Follow me.
-Let go!

167
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,549
Come with me!

168
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:02,925
-Let go!
-Come on.

169
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,219
Let go of my hand.
Do you have a death wish?

170
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,304
Sure, I'll die so you can live.

171
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,181
And you must leave this house to live.

172
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,725
Come on. Let's go.

173
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,438
-Jeez.
-I'm not leaving.

174
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,774
-Let go.
-I'm not leaving.

175
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:20,067
-Let go.
-I won't even budge.

176
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,486
You have to leave. Let go already.

177
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,614
What the hell are you doing?

178
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,160
You stay out of this.

179
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,912
Mun-yeong and I...

180
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,037
Will you get off me?

181
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,499
Well...

182
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,668
I'm taking her.

183
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,463
You should pack up
and get out of this place too. Hurry!

184
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,006
Let's go, Mun-yeong.

185
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,217
Did you just hit me?

186
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,719
-Kick him out at once.
-Hey.

187
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,013
Why are you acting all weak?

188
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,140
Dragging her against her will
is considered violence.

189
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,058
What?

190
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,601
You used it first,
so I can use it too, right?

191
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,440
Hey, that hurts!

192
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,906
Hey, wait!

193
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:50,866
Mun-yeong.

194
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,370
Hey, that guy doesn't know much about you!

195
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,915
I'm the only one who can
protect and look after you.

196
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:58,832
Mun-yeong?

197
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,593
Damn it!

198
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,436
Keep the door locked
when you're here alone.

199
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,064
-If anyone can--
-Do you think someone will harm me?

200
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:25,567
Come on. Me?
It'll probably be the other way around.

201
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:33,951
Still, keep it locked.

202
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,578
You said scary things can happen

203
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,123
when you let your guard down.

204
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:43,627
Take this fever reducer.

205
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,672
If I took crap like this
every single time I need to cool down,

206
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,924
I'd already be a junkie.

207
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,135
This won't cool me down.

208
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,139
Then get some fresh air.

209
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,255
I like what you prescribed me.

210
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,674
-Where do you want to go?
-A motel.

211
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:35,971
What do you want to eat?

212
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,181
You.

213
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,439
Are you going to keep this up?

214
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:49,276
Okay, fine. I'll follow
my doctor's instructions today.

215
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,111
What will you feed me?

216
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,072
Thank you. Enjoy.

217
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:55,616
This looks good.

218
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:57,659
Sang-tae.

219
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,961
No, don't say that. You have to say
"come on" to call me over.

220
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,425
When someone says "later,"
what does it actually mean?

221
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:14,760
Sometime before you die.

222
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,513
What? Before you die?

223
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,639
Yes.

224
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:20,808
No way.

225
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:24,686
We've known each other for so long.
He'd never do that to me.

226
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,022
For how long? How much?
1,000 won? 2,000 won?

227
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,982
I met you and Gang-tae

228
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,984
when I was only 16.

229
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,111
At Jae-su's Fried Chicken.

230
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,488
That's right.
My parents had a fried chicken place,

231
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,615
and Gang-tae worked there part-time
and lived with us.

232
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:40,077
I'm a year older than him,
but he never treated me as such.

233
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,913
And he always gave you all the drumsticks.

234
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:45,207
I only eat drumsticks.

235
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,458
I envied you.

236
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,378
I wished I'd also had
a little brother like Gang-tae.

237
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:53,132
So one day, I said to him, "Think of me
as your brother, you little prick."

238
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,760
Then he said,
"I don't need another brother."

239
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,763
-I'm his real brother.
-That was when I realized this.

240
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:05,185
"He needs a friend, not another brother."

241
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,688
I need a friend too.

242
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,449
It's good.

243
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,660
I guess what I needed was food,
not medicine.

244
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:25,747
This is awakening my ferociousness.
I feel much better now.

245
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,585
-It's not cooked yet.
-It's okay.

246
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,044
I have a lot of internal heat.

247
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,216
I can't control myself around food.

248
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,343
I'm hungry no matter how much I eat.

249
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,013
Is it because I'm an empty can?

250
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,147
I'm sorry.

251
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,317
I was just

252
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:55,611
talking nonsense then.

253
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,197
-It's true though.
-No.

254
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:02,367
You're not an empty can.

255
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,704
Then what am I?

256
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,540
Well...

257
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:11,710
A thug?

258
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,547
Eat up. It'll burn.

259
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,677
As you may already know,

260
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,055
I only sold chicken after that.

261
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,724
Fried, steamed, sweet and sour,
drumsticks, and even chicken feet.

262
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,476
-Why do you think I did that?
-Chicken head.

263
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,605
That's the only part you didn't sell.
The chicken head.

264
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,190
That's right.

265
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,360
-The chicken head isn't sellable.
-That's right.

266
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:41,281
You know, I didn't want to sell chicken.
I was even sick of the smell.

267
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:44,159
But it was the only kind of business
I could open and close quickly.

268
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,495
Because I didn't know
when my friend had to move again,

269
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,205
I kept selling chicken.

270
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,332
But this time, it felt different.

271
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:53,293
I felt that he might settle down
in Seongjin City.

272
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,755
So I put together all the money I had
and even took out a loan

273
00:20:56,838 --> 00:21:00,092
to finally open a different kind
of business. No more chicken.

274
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:01,260
But he...

275
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,513
He left me.

276
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:05,973
Why?

277
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,976
Because he likes

278
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,479
that lunatic Ko Mun-yeong
more than me, his friend of 15 years.

279
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,148
-No, that's not why.
-That is why!

280
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,066
It was because of me.

281
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,236
Gang-tae followed me
because of my contract with her.

282
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,321
It's like a BOGO deal.

283
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,785
Don't trust Gang-tae too much.

284
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,412
You might end up like me.

285
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:29,871
Like you?

286
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,250
Like the dog that chased the chicken.

287
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:34,668
A dog?

288
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,426
A dog!

289
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:52,978
That was loud. I'm sorry. That was loud.

290
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,691
-Hello, Mr. Moon.
-Hello!

291
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,287
By the way, why aren't you eating?
You're just feeding me.

292
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:12,873
I'm not really hungry.

293
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,291
Have you ever slept with a woman?

294
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,005
-Never?
-Why are you suddenly talking nonsense?

295
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,923
You seem to have no desires whatsoever.

296
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:25,469
You don't want to eat, have,
or do anything.

297
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:26,428
You always look apathetic.

298
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,263
-I'm not apathetic.
-Then what?

299
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,478
I'm just suppressing myself.

300
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:35,937
Why?

301
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,859
You do everything you want to do,
but that's not the case for most people.

302
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,029
Don't suppress yourself.
It shouldn't be that hard.

303
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,247
Your safety pin...

304
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:56,416
Shall I pull it for you?

305
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,545
I'm curious

306
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:03,548
to see what will happen
if you don't suppress yourself.

307
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,263
Hey, Byeol.

308
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,725
Patient Park Ji-hwan
falls from his bed easily,

309
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,645
so make sure you help him if he needs
to go to the bathroom at night.

310
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:19,731
I've already told Mr. O Cha-yong
everything he needs to know.

311
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,900
Both of you should check on him
when doing your rounds.

312
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,235
Okay, got it.

313
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:26,113
And as for patient Kim Jeong-mi's
depression...

314
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,739
Just a second.

315
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,744
What's up? Sang-tae is here.

316
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:36,623
He's chatting with the employee
from Ko Mun-yeong's publishing company.

317
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:37,624
It's pissing me off.

318
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:43,880
Who is it?

319
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,715
It's nothing.

320
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:49,719
-Where were we?
-Patient Kim Jeong-mi.

321
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,640
That was a lengthy explanation.

322
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,851
Let me sum it up for you.

323
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:59,521
If Mr. Lee Sang-in's muse is
Ms. Ko Mun-yeong,

324
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,691
then as the art director,
I get inspiration from you.

325
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:05,735
You're my muse.
That was what I was trying to say.

326
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:08,488
I see.

327
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,368
That's why

328
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:17,247
I brought some illustrations
you can refer to

329
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,791
while working on Ms. Ko's next book--

330
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,422
-Where are you going?
-I'm leaving for the day.

331
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,633
It's rude to talk about irrelevant work

332
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,594
at someone else's workplace.
Complete nonsense.

333
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:35,265
Let's... Let's talk about it later.

334
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,142
"Later" means sometime before you die.

335
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:39,811
Jae-su, this is for you.

336
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:43,607
-Bye, Sang-tae.
-Bye!

337
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,572
What did he draw?

338
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,579
The dog that chased the chicken.

339
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:02,959
Why are we walking?

340
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,294
What?

341
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:07,464
It's nice to walk and enjoy the scenery.

342
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:11,009
It helps you clear your mind
and lifts your spirits.

343
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,763
Really? All I can think is that
my legs hurt and it's a waste of time.

344
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,098
-Then shall we--
-Will you carry me?

345
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:18,767
What?

346
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,271
I wonder if Sang-tae is on his way home.

347
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,233
I guess he's fine on his own.

348
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,277
No! Jeez.

349
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:35,700
So you should just focus on me.

350
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:38,703
Okay, give it back.

351
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,582
Come on. Give it back.

352
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,335
Stop it.

353
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:56,972
Are you

354
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,266
holding me in your arms now?

355
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:08,108
-Hey, Ju-ri.
-Hey.

356
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,195
Ko Mun-yeong?

357
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,864
My daring roommate
is in an awkward situation now,

358
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:16,992
so I'm answering his phone. What's up?

359
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:22,789
Well, he didn't come into work today.

360
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,421
He took the day off to hang out with me.

361
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:30,755
Bye.

362
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:51,318
You didn't go to work
because you were worried about me?

363
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:55,572
And you took me out on a date
to help me cool off?

364
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:58,533
Who said this was a date?

365
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:00,702
What was this, then?

366
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,705
Are you flirting with me?
Or are you feeling it out?

367
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,583
Are you just testing the waters?
Or are you playing me?

368
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:11,588
Fine.

369
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:13,882
Let's date.

370
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:19,763
"Get lost."

371
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,391
-What?
-"Get lost."

372
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,811
Do you know how many times
you've said that to me?

373
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:30,106
Even last night. And that day too.

374
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:32,525
So what?

375
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,778
But last night, it sounded like

376
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:37,739
you were begging me not to leave.

377
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,117
Last time, I ran away.

378
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:44,371
But today,

379
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,249
I thought I should stay with you.

380
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:54,672
That's all it meant.

381
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,978
Ko Mun-yeong, you heartless woman.

382
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:11,398
All my organs are rotting

383
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:14,442
because of the stress from
looking after you for the past ten years.

384
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:17,404
How could you gang up on me
with that caregiver you just met

385
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,697
and kick me out? Just how?

386
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:24,077
Fine, you two heartless jerks
can live happily ever after.

387
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:30,125
I'm going to find the kindest

388
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,252
and sweetest woman on earth and--

389
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:33,837
Shit!

390
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:37,340
You're so loud. Damn it!

391
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:50,019
Unrequited love is so hard. I give up!

392
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,657
I guess you've never seen a woman

393
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,368
who's heartbroken by unrequited love.

394
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:08,872
Hey, Jae-su.

395
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:18,298
Why

396
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,009
can't it be me?

397
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,387
Why that bitch?

398
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:28,349
I can

399
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:31,895
swear too.

400
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:34,397
And I can also

401
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:40,945
throw temper tantrums and smash things.

402
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,072
I can

403
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:47,410
stop acting nice all the time.

404
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,370
And I can

405
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,541
be a bitch too.

406
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:58,379
Gosh, no. Not everyone can be a bitch.

407
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:10,850
Who are you?

408
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:13,645
Why cut me off?

409
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:16,773
I'm not a weirdo.

410
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,275
I'm...

411
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:23,822
the CEO of SangSangESang Publishers.

412
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,740
My name is Lee Sang-in.

413
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,700
CEO LEE SANG-IN

414
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,472
So it's all your fault.

415
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:50,682
Don't cry.

416
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,309
Do you know me?

417
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:58,857
You should've talked Ko Mun-yeong
out of it.

418
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,860
Then she wouldn't have moved here,

419
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,071
and those two would've never met.

420
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,866
Then I wouldn't have ended up like this.

421
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:10,910
This is all on you.

422
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,747
CEO Lee Sang-in.

423
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,749
It's all your fault.

424
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,718
Hold on, this voice...

425
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:28,761
Are you...

426
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:30,555
Hello?

427
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:31,639
My tears.

428
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:35,435
Mr. Lee. I'm Nam Ju-ri,
a nurse at OK Psychiatric Hospital.

429
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,021
Nurse Nam Ju-ri?

430
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,451
Last time, I ran away.

431
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,954
But today,
I thought I should stay with you.

432
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,126
What is it?

433
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:01,753
Nothing.

434
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:13,431
I had a nightmare last night.

435
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,937
My nightmares are always about my mom.

436
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,815
And when I wake up from the dream,

437
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:26,653
I always feel like shit.

438
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,323
But today,

439
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:33,826
I don't feel so shitty.

440
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,050
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

441
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,969
But why? Just why?

442
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,553
Why are they getting rid of the class?

443
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,348
I liked her class because it was always
like a big smack in the head.

444
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,517
I knew they'd get rid of it.

445
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:59,435
I always questioned her state of mind,

446
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,895
and she had a bad attitude.

447
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,648
-Are you a school superintendent?
-I'm just a super old man, you punk!

448
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,316
Stop hitting me in the head, will you?

449
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:07,193
You said you like a big smack in the head.

450
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:11,698
I did all the homework.
They can't get rid of this class.

451
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:15,201
I was confident
that she'd compliment me this time.

452
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,454
Are you possessed by a spirit
who wants to brag about doing homework?

453
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:21,499
Why cry so early in the morning?
You're ruining my day.

454
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:24,293
Why must you say such mean things
to A-reum so early in the morning?

455
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:25,712
You two...

456
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,755
Are you seeing each other or something?

457
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,216
Let's go, A-reum. Just ignore her.

458
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:36,389
I think they'll cause trouble
sooner or later.

459
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,358
Did you eat?

460
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,737
I had a fried egg, cubed radish kimchi,
three sausages, and soybean paste stew.

461
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,364
What are you doing right now?

462
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,283
I'm just sitting down.

463
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,660
What about Ms. Ko?

464
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,162
She's just sitting down.

465
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,288
What?

466
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:19,265
-Sang-tae.
-Yes?

467
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,226
-Let's just have fun today.
-Okay.

468
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:34,739
Come in.

469
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:40,078
I heard you asked for me yesterday.

470
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,955
Yes, there's something I want to ask you.

471
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,795
Does Ms. Ko have a boyfriend?

472
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:55,009
Well, I'm not sure.

473
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:57,887
I have a son. I had him pretty late.

474
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:00,807
Anyway, I'd like to introduce him to her.

475
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,727
Don't worry. He takes after his mom,
so he looks nothing like me.

476
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,981
What do you say? Should I do it or not?

477
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,444
Why are you asking me?

478
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:14,779
Because you live with her.

479
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:31,921
Let's come separately next time.
People will get the wrong idea.

480
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:34,006
When are you done?
Let's go home together. I'll wait.

481
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,008
Does your car run on gasoline or diesel?

482
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:41,430
I've been psychoanalyzing people
for so long

483
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:46,018
that I can tell what their stories are
just by looking in their eyes.

484
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:47,603
Why didn't you come in yesterday?

485
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,690
I wasn't feeling well.

486
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,275
You mean, Ms. Ko wasn't feeling well?

487
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,444
Yes.

488
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:57,905
Ms. Sun Byeol said

489
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:01,951
Ms. Kang Eun-ja acted like she was her mom
and bugged her. Is that why?

490
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:06,747
It seemed like Ms. Ko

491
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:11,752
thought she was actually her mother
for a moment.

492
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,425
THE MURDER OF THE WITCH OF THE WEST
WRITTEN BY DO HUI-JAE

493
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,970
Ms. Ko's mother

494
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:23,181
is the writer, Do Hui-jae.

495
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,853
The day she finished the last book
of her fiction series,

496
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,480
she vanished without a trace.

497
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:36,569
Then she was registered as deceased
five years after she disappeared.

498
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,698
THE MURDER OF THE WITCH OF THE WEST

499
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,328
You're always one step late.

500
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,876
Some believed that she was still alive.

501
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,670
There were a lot of rumors back then.

502
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,508
Could she be alive?

503
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:03,512
Then she wouldn't have kept
her readers waiting for almost 20 years,

504
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,097
knowing how much they want

505
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:08,434
to find out what ends up happening
to the Witch of the West.

506
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:15,233
My nightmares are always about my mom.

507
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:20,321
It must've been a big shock to Ms. Ko.
And I'm sure she misses her a lot.

508
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:25,618
Maybe that's why she mistook
someone else for her mother.

509
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:28,537
But what if she doesn't miss her?

510
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:31,123
What if she fears her?

511
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:39,131
COUNSELLING NOTE
PATIENT NAME KO DAE-HWAN

512
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,676
HE GAVE SHORT, SIMPLE ANSWERS BUT DIDN'T
TRY TO AVOID ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS

513
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,190
My wife?

514
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:01,237
She was incredibly intelligent
and elegant.

515
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:05,574
She loved our daughter very much.

516
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,369
Maybe too much.

517
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,290
Every night, she sang

518
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:15,334
Oh My Darling, Clementine  as a lullaby.

519
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:19,380
I wonder

520
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:25,344
if she knew
the true meaning behind the song.

521
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:41,736
KO MUN-YEONG'S FAIRY TALE CLASS
PUT ON PAUSE TEMPORARILY

522
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,040
-Ms. Park.
-What's the matter?

523
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:56,167
Are you sad
that her class is put on pause?

524
00:38:58,377 --> 00:38:59,211
No.

525
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:04,842
I think the patients are sad about it.

526
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,927
They found the class
different and interesting.

527
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:09,388
It is interesting.

528
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,393
You should check out her books
when you have some time.

529
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,896
No, I wouldn't be able
to relate to those stories.

530
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,524
I like cruel and foolish love stories
or horror novels.

531
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,111
I'll take some water to the padded room.

532
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,614
All right. Thanks.
Take good care of the patient.

533
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:44,131
Would you like some water?

534
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:52,348
Well...

535
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,266
About your daughter.

536
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:57,937
You said you'd like me to meet her.

537
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,898
Next time she visits you, I will--

538
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,024
My daughter...

539
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,154
is dead.

540
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,242
Mom.

541
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:16,205
How are you going to meet a dead girl?

542
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,422
Even I can't meet her.

543
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:30,886
Dr. Kwon!

544
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,139
Darn it.

545
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:37,184
Dr. Kwon, Ms. Kang Eun-ja is showing
conversion symptoms.

546
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,145
What? Is she in the padded room?

547
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,438
-Yes.
-Let's go.

548
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:45,234
This shawl...

549
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,780
It's very expensive.

550
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,161
It's worth more than
hundreds of millions of won.

551
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,208
I had never received

552
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,546
something so expensive in my entire life.

553
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,800
We barely managed to afford a living.

554
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,721
But she spent her entire paycheck

555
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,557
to buy me

556
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:20,060
this shawl

557
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,146
for my birthday.

558
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,232
How much is this?

559
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:27,526
How many zeros are there?

560
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:31,655
Goodness! Go and get a refund right now!

561
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:35,367
I got so furious and angry.

562
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:40,831
So I slapped her really hard on her back.

563
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:46,086
Do you think somebody like me
deserves something this expensive?

564
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,922
I'm so sick

565
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:51,967
and tired of you being like this.

566
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,808
I don't remember much.

567
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:03,979
But I remember saying this.

568
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:07,608
I don't need
an immature daughter like you!

569
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:10,903
I ended up telling her that I don't need

570
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:15,908
a daughter like her.

571
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,388
If I had known
she was going to die like that,

572
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:39,557
I never would've

573
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,603
said something so harsh.

574
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:49,149
Never.

575
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,156
-Gang-tae.
-Yes?

576
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:59,660
You need to stay by your brother's side
until the day you die.

577
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:01,745
That's why

578
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:05,416
I gave birth to you.

579
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:18,804
Why in the world did I say that to her?

580
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:25,394
I'm such an idiot.

581
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:09,688
Why do you look so sad?

582
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:13,025
You're making it hard for me to get angry.

583
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:15,527
You should also lie down.

584
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:29,333
Jae-su.

585
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:30,918
Yes?

586
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:34,088
Do you think

587
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,050
my mom also feels sorry

588
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,845
for how she treated me?

589
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:46,934
Do you think

590
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:51,689
she regrets it?

591
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:55,984
Is that what you want?

592
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:01,407
Yes.

593
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:07,621
No.

594
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:21,427
Ma'am, why were you so mean to Gang-tae?

595
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:24,430
Sang-tae wasn't your only son!

596
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:26,014
I know he's sick, but still!

597
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:29,143
Why did you discriminate Gang-tae
and prevent him from growing up properly?

598
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:32,813
You're crazy.

599
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:39,194
You just wait 60 years.

600
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:42,489
Once I meet you up there, I'm going to--

601
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,074
What are you going to do?

602
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:46,660
My goodness.

603
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:50,706
All mothers are sinners.

604
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:56,545
But even so, cut your mother some slack.

605
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:02,801
Do you think it was easy for a woman
to raise kids without a husband back then?

606
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:04,428
My goodness.

607
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:09,016
I only have a daughter,
but even I wanted to run away at times.

608
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:13,770
But your mother
successfully raised two boys.

609
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:16,440
On top of that, Sang-tae is one of a kind.

610
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:27,159
You've been taking care of your brother,
so I'm sure you know

611
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:30,287
how hard it must've been for her.

612
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:36,335
Cheers to us. This is for you up there.

613
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:02,402
My goodness, you're unbelievable.

614
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:04,530
Do you feel better now?

615
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:09,952
-Gang-tae came by and left just now.
-Why? Was he alone? What did he say?

616
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:13,830
If you like him so much,

617
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:17,251
why did you come home
on some other guy's back last night?

618
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:20,087
Someone carried me home? Really?

619
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:23,799
You know what? It's better not to know.

620
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:26,260
Just don't bother remembering anything.
That'd be best.

621
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:35,811
CEO LEE SANG-IN

622
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:37,729
I'm the CEO of SangSangESang Publishers.

623
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:46,947
-Mr. Lee.
-Yes?

624
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:49,992
I want you to fix this!

625
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:58,542
I must've lost my mind.

626
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:16,393
Where are you? When are you coming?

627
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,062
Hurry up and come home. I'm bored.

628
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,023
Why are you ignoring me?
Are you kidding me?

629
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:25,861
WATE.

630
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:30,490
WIAT.

631
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:36,204
WAIT.

632
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:13,825
Why are you so late?

633
00:49:14,951 --> 00:49:17,371
-Why were you sleeping here?
-You told me to wait. Damn it.

634
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:20,916
Did you drink?

635
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:23,377
With whom?

636
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,045
That two-faced bitch?

637
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:27,673
No, not her.

638
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:30,592
I drank with Jo Jae-su,
a chicken farm owner's son,

639
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,928
and a live-in cook
who's over 60 years old.

640
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:35,555
Did you meet people from online?

641
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:36,973
"Meet people from online"?

642
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:40,435
You're drunk.

643
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:43,814
I was drunk,

644
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:48,068
but the cab driver told me
he doesn't come here at night

645
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:51,363
because this place is scary
and brings bad luck,

646
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:53,115
and he told me to get out of the cab.

647
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:56,827
So I walked all the way here,
and I'm almost sober now.

648
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:02,499
Then let's drink some more.

649
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:05,127
No, forget it. This is
just the right amount of tipsiness.

650
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:07,462
I want to drink.

651
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,297
No, you can't.

652
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:11,633
You never do things in moderation.

653
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:15,595
If both of us end up getting drunk,

654
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:19,266
it'll be bad.

655
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:21,476
Why?

656
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:23,603
Are you scared I might come onto you?

657
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,983
-Stop acting up.
-Did you just hit me?

658
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,068
You hurt me with a knife.

659
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:35,198
You have good comebacks when you're drunk.

660
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:44,833
I want to pull out your safety pin.

661
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:47,711
Close your eyes.

662
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:49,963
Why?

663
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:51,465
Just close your eyes.

664
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,342
You're so cliché.

665
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:05,520
Here. Open your eyes.

666
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:10,942
What is this piece of crap?

667
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:12,319
A nightmare catcher.

668
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:18,074
If you sleep with this in your hand,

669
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:21,703
it collects your nightmares in its basket

670
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,455
and eats it up overnight.

671
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,417
Then you'll be able to sleep comfortably.

672
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:30,879
How childish.

673
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,632
I brought it from home today.

674
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:37,844
-It used to be my brother's.
-What? It's used?

675
00:51:39,095 --> 00:51:41,389
I made it myself.

676
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:47,938
If it's handmade, I guess it's worth it.

677
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:51,316
This guy's name is Mang-tae.

678
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:57,239
Don't tell me you named it Mang-tae
because you're Gang-tae,

679
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:59,157
and your brother is Sang-tae.

680
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:04,162
The three of us

681
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:06,540
are brothers.

682
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:10,585
Unbelievable.

683
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,090
To be honest,

684
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:19,928
my brother also has nightmares
just like you.

685
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:24,516
He's been having nightmares

686
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:27,477
ever since our mom passed away.

687
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:38,280
My brother felt tormented,

688
00:52:40,156 --> 00:52:42,200
but there was nothing I could do.

689
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:47,372
All I could do

690
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,417
was make him this silly doll.

691
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:58,341
Well, it's kind of cute
now that I take a close look at it.

692
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:03,597
-Do you want it?
-Yes, I want it.

693
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:06,683
Okay.

694
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:08,935
Good night.

695
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:26,453
Mang-tae.

696
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:46,306
Sang-tae.

697
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,099
Are you sleeping?

698
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:51,269
Are you really sleeping?

699
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:58,985
Gosh, you reek of alcohol.
I'm... I'm so upset.

700
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:02,072
My gosh, you... You stink.
You reek of alcohol.

701
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:08,161
Sang-tae, let's have  jjamppong  someday

702
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:10,497
at that place we used to go with Mom.

703
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:13,249
-It's at the entrance of the market.
-Yes.

704
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:18,505
You used to love the  jjamppong  there.

705
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:22,592
No, you... You were the one who loved it.

706
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,680
No, you always--

707
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:29,891
"It has chili pepper and mussels inside.
The broth tastes amazing.

708
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:31,977
I want to have it every day, Mom."
You told her that.

709
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:35,313
That's why she bought us that  jjamppong

710
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,399
every time the market opened.

711
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:40,610
"It's spicy but tasty."

712
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:43,989
Sang-tae,  jjamppong  is spicy but tasty.

713
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:45,991
It makes me want to eat it again.

714
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:47,158
HARIMGAK

715
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:49,619
The  jjamppong  is here.

716
00:54:51,287 --> 00:54:52,330
-Thank you.
-Sure.

717
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:54,332
Here. Eat up.

718
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,252
What about you, Mom?

719
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:58,586
I'm not hungry.

720
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:00,880
Eat up.

721
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:03,258
It's... It's spicy.

722
00:55:03,341 --> 00:55:06,011
-Is it spicy? Drink some water.
-It's spicy.

723
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,056
It's spicy.

724
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,851
My gosh, it's pouring.

725
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:18,857
You'll catch a cold. Are you okay?

726
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:32,829
Gang-tae, what are you doing?

727
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:37,917
-Gang-tae, get over here. It's raining.
-Gang-tae, get over here.

728
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:38,835
Come on.

729
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,636
Look at you. You're all wet.

730
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:51,347
Let's go home and get you changed.

731
00:55:52,348 --> 00:55:53,433
Be careful.

732
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:57,145
Gang-tae, should we
eat  jjamppong  again tomorrow?

733
00:55:57,395 --> 00:55:58,229
"Jjamppong"?

734
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:03,485
It's hard to lose five kilograms.
But I tried so hard.

735
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:06,112
I didn't drink Coke or eat rice,
and I lost five kilograms.

736
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,364
I lost five kilograms. It was amazing.

737
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:18,666
We... We need to listen to our mom.

738
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,752
We need to listen to our mom.

739
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:23,630
We need to listen to our mom
in order to be a good person.

740
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:27,133
Our mom knows everything.

741
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:30,845
Our mom knows... She knows everything.

742
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:33,765
Don't catch a cold. Don't drink Coke.

743
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:05,046
My adorable son.

744
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:09,759
I'm so sorry for everything.

745
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:24,274
Sang-tae.

746
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:26,484
Yes?

747
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:35,994
I miss Mom.

748
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:38,746
Yes.

749
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:43,460
I want  jjamppong , too.

750
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:49,299
I want  jjamppong  every single day.

751
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:27,045
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

752
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:28,546
Everyone badmouths you

753
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:31,341
saying you made Ms. Kang Eun-ja collapse.

754
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:32,884
But I never badmouthed you.

755
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:35,929
To be honest, that woman isn't sane.

756
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:38,223
She always wears the shawl she got
from her late daughter

757
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:39,974
and pretends like she's rich.

758
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:42,477
-That darn geezer. Move.
-I really don't think--

759
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:44,604
Ms. Ko.

760
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:47,982
-She hit me again.
-Darn it.

761
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:52,320
Oh, gosh.

762
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:54,906
Emergency.

763
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:58,368
We have a situation. What should we do?

764
00:58:58,451 --> 00:58:59,869
-What is it?
-What's wrong?

765
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:03,081
Will you please be quiet?

766
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:04,499
Be silent.

767
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:07,418
Are you trying to agitate the patients?

768
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:09,796
Be careful when you use
the word "emergency."

769
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:13,132
Ms. Ko is here. I think she came
not knowing her class got canceled.

770
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:17,178
She had this look on her face
and went to find the director.

771
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:19,847
-Didn't you call her?
-Didn't you?

772
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:21,724
Why didn't you?

773
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:24,310
-What?
-You guys are close.

774
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:25,228
No, they're not!

775
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:28,606
Wait. Wait a minute.

776
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:33,069
Does that mean
no one called and told Ms. Ko

777
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:35,196
that her fairy tale class got canceled?

778
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:36,948
What's wrong with you?

779
00:59:37,031 --> 00:59:39,867
She found out through the notice board.
She must be furious right now.

780
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:41,119
I'll go find her.

781
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:45,415
I used to run marathons when I was young.

782
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:47,792
But one day, my knees got infected.

783
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:52,463
I should've gotten some rest,
but I just ran a marathon again.

784
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:57,760
In the end, my cartilage got ruined,
and I ended up with metal pins.

785
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:59,804
Now, it's hard for me
to even walk properly.

786
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:05,727
Don't make the same mistake I did
and try to run when you can't even walk.

787
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,569
When you're tired, get some rest.
When you're sad, go ahead and cry.

788
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:18,656
It's okay to take a break.

789
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,325
Then one day,

790
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:24,621
there will surely come a day
when you'll be able to run again.

791
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:28,291
I bet your daughter is cheering you on.

792
01:00:31,085 --> 01:00:34,213
That darn geezer. How dare he cancel
my class without telling me?

793
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:36,674
There he is.

794
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,637
Darn, did he take drugs or something?
Why is he so fast?

795
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:48,394
Ms. Ko!

796
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:57,028
Wait here for a second.

797
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:00,448
Let me take you back to your room.

798
01:01:03,868 --> 01:01:04,702
I'm sorry.

799
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,624
I'm guessing I put you
in a difficult position.

800
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:12,502
You didn't just put me
in a difficult position.

801
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:14,045
I got fired.

802
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:15,838
Hey.

803
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:17,715
How will you compensate for this?

804
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:29,644
This is expensive.

805
01:01:31,562 --> 01:01:34,315
-I want it.
-But that's...

806
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:35,483
Let me have this.

807
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:41,406
You told me you're sorry.
Then you should compensate for the damage.

808
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:43,449
That's what you call a sincere apology.

809
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:54,502
Give it back.

810
01:01:58,297 --> 01:01:59,590
Take it.

811
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:05,263
I've had it for more than enough.

812
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,484
Mr. Moon.

813
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:20,737
Yes?

814
01:02:21,779 --> 01:02:23,573
The burden is finally gone.

815
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:39,338
Isn't it hot?

816
01:02:39,964 --> 01:02:41,466
I bet your neck is sweating.

817
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:45,511
If you want to be fashionable,
you must be uncomfortable and stubborn.

818
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:50,933
My brother is immersed
in one of your books these days.

819
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:52,935
I know.

820
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:54,645
The Cheerful Dog.

821
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:03,112
"Once upon a time,

822
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:08,201
there lived a dog that was
very good at hiding his emotions.

823
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:11,871
The dog was tied beneath a shade tree.

824
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:14,373
He always wagged his tail and acted cute.

825
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:17,835
So he got the name, "The Cheerful Dog,"
because he was as cheerful as springtime.

826
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:22,381
The dog always had lots of fun
with the village kids during the day.

827
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:23,758
But every night,

828
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:28,971
he'd moan and whine
when no one was around.

829
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:34,143
That's because
he wanted to cut off the leash

830
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:38,523
and freely run around
out in the spring field.

831
01:03:39,023 --> 01:03:41,359
However, he couldn't.

832
01:03:41,442 --> 01:03:44,237
And that's why he cried every night.

833
01:03:44,695 --> 01:03:47,490
Every single night.

834
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:49,242
One day,

835
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:53,788
a voice inside him asked the Cheerful Dog.

836
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:59,544
'Hey, why don't you just cut off the leash
and run away?'

837
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:02,255
And this is what the Cheerful Dog said..."

838
01:04:03,464 --> 01:04:07,176
"I've been tied up for way too long.

839
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:10,972
So I forgot how to cut myself free."

840
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,653
You did great, Mun-yeong.

841
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:28,823
What did I do?

842
01:04:30,074 --> 01:04:31,868
You helped her cut herself free.

843
01:05:02,106 --> 01:05:03,149
You will

844
01:05:06,777 --> 01:05:09,405
end up like your mother.

845
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:14,660
You won't be able to escape.

846
01:05:17,371 --> 01:05:18,205
No.

847
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:21,083
I'm different.

848
01:06:35,449 --> 01:06:36,534
Your...

849
01:06:38,577 --> 01:06:40,162
-Your hair--
-I...

850
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:42,456
cut off my leash.

851
01:06:58,264 --> 01:07:01,517
PATIENT ROOM 201-208

852
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,174
It's all done.

853
01:09:22,616 --> 01:09:23,576
How do I look?

854
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:28,080
You look pretty.

855
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:01,947
SPECIAL THANKS TO BAE HAE-SUN
FOR MAKING A GUEST APPEARANCE

856
01:10:39,526 --> 01:10:40,444
I'm very pretty.

857
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,905
I'm just like your brother.

858
01:10:42,988 --> 01:10:44,782
Longer hair suits you better.

859
01:10:44,865 --> 01:10:46,951
Why did she cut it? Why?

860
01:10:47,034 --> 01:10:48,118
Chew on this.

861
01:10:48,702 --> 01:10:50,454
Why do you think she lied?

862
01:10:50,537 --> 01:10:53,165
It seems like something strange
is happening at our hospital.

863
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:55,251
That woman

864
01:10:56,293 --> 01:10:57,294
is dead.

865
01:10:58,045 --> 01:10:59,880
But she's here.

866
01:11:01,131 --> 01:11:02,716
Safety pin and bomb.

867
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:06,220
You're patient, and I'm volatile.

868
01:11:06,303 --> 01:11:08,055
Could you take a photo of us?

869
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:11,642
According to Mr. Lee, I sell one more book
every time I smile at a fan.

870
01:11:11,725 --> 01:11:13,352
An author only needs to write well.

871
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:15,062
She's not a celebrity.

872
01:11:15,145 --> 01:11:17,147
-Are you jealous?
-Jealous, my ass.

873
01:11:20,317 --> 01:11:21,277
"Offer"?

874
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:24,405
But if I give all my stuff to people
who need them,

875
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,033
what will I have left?

876
01:11:31,328 --> 01:11:33,956
