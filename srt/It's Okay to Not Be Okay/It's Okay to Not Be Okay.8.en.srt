1
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,337
Are you sure I can trust you?

2
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,381
I also cut my brother's hair for him.

3
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:31,883
I'm the only one who can touch it.

4
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:37,305
The sea should be here. Hello!

5
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,143
He asked you to
cut his hair like that, right?

6
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,061
No.

7
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,647
I came up with that hairstyle.

8
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,565
I don't want a mushroom haircut.

9
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:49,567
It's too late.

10
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,528
I have the scissors.

11
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,948
Stay still if you want this to go well.

12
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:15,218
It's all done.

13
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,528
How do I look?

14
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:20,950
You look pretty.

15
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,339
I no longer need to listen to my mom

16
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,715
now that I cut off my leash.

17
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,134
So you wanted to escape from

18
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:39,552
your mother?

19
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,138
Yes.

20
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:43,890
Now, I'm free.

21
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,268
Congratulations.

22
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:50,980
Don't congratulate me.

23
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,440
I want a compliment.

24
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,157
Good for you. I'm so proud of you.

25
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,205
Now, let's go have fun wherever.
Whether it's to a mountain or a field.

26
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,332
Like the Cheerful Dog?

27
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,876
Yes, like the Cheerful Dog.

28
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:27,976
CHAPTER 8
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST

29
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:31,104
It is a flower

30
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:34,232
Even if it blooms in the field
It is a flower

31
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,735
It is a flower

32
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,989
It is a flower

33
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,032
They're all flowers

34
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:54,794
What... What happened to your long hair?

35
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,129
I cut it.

36
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:59,173
-What do you think?
-Long hair suits you better.

37
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,218
What do you mean?
She looks better with short hair.

38
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,553
No.

39
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,014
She looked 100 to 1,000 times better
when her long, black hair

40
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,474
used to come down
all the way to her waist.

41
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,684
Why did she cut it?

42
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:12,103
-Why did you do that? Why?
-Sang-tae.

43
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,940
Let me cut your hair today as well.
It's really long.

44
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,608
You gave me a haircut on Wednesday.

45
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:18,901
I only gave you a trim.

46
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,987
Let's cut off a bit more today.
Now, eat up.

47
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,573
Okay. You looked better with long hair.

48
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,616
Why did you do that?
You shouldn't have cut it off.

49
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,038
Why did you get such an ugly haircut?

50
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:31,956
Why did you just kick me?

51
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,293
-Me?
-Yes, that's right. You.

52
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,420
You just kicked me three times.

53
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,213
These darn quail eggs.

54
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,012
Here.

55
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,481
I want a rolled omelet.

56
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:09,869
Here.

57
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,214
-Here.
-You should do it yourself.

58
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,466
You're not a baby.

59
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:27,220
Your brother is so slow-witted.

60
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,223
You mean he's too honest.

61
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,434
Are you taking your brother's side?

62
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,895
Of course. We're brothers.

63
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,273
Hey.

64
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:44,112
Come home as soon as you finish work.

65
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:45,738
Come and spend time with me.

66
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,830
From now on,
you're in charge of cutting my hair.

67
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:36,747
Okay?

68
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,125
Why not just go to a hair salon?

69
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,879
I'm just like your brother.

70
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,630
I don't like it
when other people touch me.

71
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,800
But you're an exception.
Only you can touch me.

72
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,059
Do I really look pretty?

73
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,317
Yes.

74
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,027
You look pretty.

75
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,037
I agree.

76
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,581
I also think I'm really pretty.

77
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,710
What was that laugh for?

78
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,464
Don't fight with Sang-tae.
Make sure you get along.

79
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:28,841
I'll see you.

80
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,349
Come home quickly.
If you're late, I'll kill you.

81
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,265
-Hello.
-Hello.

82
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:25,022
KO MUN-YEONG'S FAIRY TALE CLASS
PUT ON PAUSE TEMPORARILY

83
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:35,866
Gosh, you scared me.

84
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,452
Do I look that bad?

85
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,665
I look like a zombie.

86
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,209
Did something happen at night?

87
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,378
Do you have a concealer?

88
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,255
-What's that?
-Maybe a cushion?

89
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,465
-The cushions are in the lounge.
-No, a cushion compact.

90
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:54,468
Forget it.

91
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:59,056
Did something happen with a patient?
Who was it?

92
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:00,683
Mr. Ko Dae-hwan.

93
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,226
Why? What happened?

94
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,814
He had a seizure last night again.
It was a complete nightmare.

95
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:10,067
He came out to the hallway
with his eyes rolling upwards.

96
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,361
Then he started foaming at the mouth
and had spasms.

97
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,490
I didn't get to sleep a wink.

98
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:21,287
Gosh, why does this happen
every time I'm on night duty?

99
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:22,705
Why?

100
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,256
My goodness.

101
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,053
Do you think he'll be okay?

102
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,930
I'm worried he might have
another brain tumor.

103
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,974
He kept talking gibberish all night.

104
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,559
Don't worry too much.

105
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,562
I bet you didn't get any sleep last night.

106
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,898
I was actually thinking about
skipping meditation class

107
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,650
and get some good sleep instead.

108
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,234
You should do that. Here.

109
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:01,661
Get some sleep.

110
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:13,923
Mr. Moon.

111
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,801
Mr. Ko has drooled too much.

112
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:18,928
Can you help him get changed?

113
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:20,721
Sure.

114
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,646
That woman...

115
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,650
sang

116
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,902
a song.

117
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,947
What song?

118
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,698
"Oh My Darling, Clementine."

119
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:42,910
I'm sure

120
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:45,955
she's dead.

121
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,421
But that woman

122
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,716
is here.

123
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,512
Who are you

124
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:03,639
talking about?

125
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,937
She's dead.

126
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,649
But she's here.

127
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:24,368
WHAT IS THE TRUTH BEHIND WRITER
KO MUN-YEONG'S DISAPPEARANCE?

128
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,287
KO MUN-YEONG IS LOOKING AFTER
HER SICK FATHER

129
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,621
IS SHE PLANNING TO RETIRE?

130
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,002
She's pretending to be a kind daughter.

131
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,837
I bet she doesn't even care.

132
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,840
She needs to become a better person first.

133
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,342
A fairy tale writer who cusses
doesn't deserve to write.

134
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,636
I really regret having read her books.

135
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:46,724
I want to gather these insects
and spray pesticide on them.

136
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,101
Darn it.

137
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,729
I used to have tons of fans.
Where in the world are they?

138
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,115
Actually, my fan is right here.

139
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,660
Don't forget to ventilate the room
after you spray pesticide.

140
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:10,789
But if you want to kill insects properly,
electric fly swatters are the best.

141
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,585
Sang-tae, why do you like my fairy tales?

142
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,339
Because you wrote them.

143
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,636
So you like me, not my fairy tales.

144
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,096
-Why do you like me?
-Because you're pretty.

145
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,476
What do you like about me?

146
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,605
Your hair. Your long hair.

147
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,316
Your long, black hair
that came all the way to your waist.

148
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,235
It was so pretty. Gosh.

149
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,071
-You cut it off. You shouldn't have.
-End of meeting.

150
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,367
We never started a meeting.

151
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,661
How can you end a meeting
when we never even started one?

152
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,204
You give me a headache.

153
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,122
-Let's have a meeting later.
-"Later?"

154
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:53,666
Later... Later.

155
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,085
You mean sometime before you die?

156
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,129
No, I need to get a camping car.

157
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,507
I need to receive a camping car.

158
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,389
Did you get the information I asked for?

159
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:15,437
I know you told me
this is all part of work,

160
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,315
but I felt so uneasy
about doing a background search.

161
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,525
Why?

162
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,152
You're good at doing that.

163
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:26,574
If you hadn't done a background search
on that caregiver for Mun-yeong--

164
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,576
Her name is Nam Ju-ri.
She's currently single.

165
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,370
She met Moon Gang-tae
when they worked together

166
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:32,913
at the same hospital a year ago.

167
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:35,833
They haven't known each other long.

168
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,252
Her father died due to an illness
when she was little.

169
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,795
Oh, dear.

170
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,715
And her mother used to cook
for construction workers.

171
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,675
My goodness, she had a tough life.

172
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:48,095
Right now, she's working as a cook
at OK Psychiatric Hospital.

173
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,306
And the daughter and mother
are living together

174
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,391
at a two-story house
with a mortgage to pay off.

175
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,435
The Moon brothers live
in the rooftop house.

176
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:57,980
And their friend who runs a pizza place
lives in the basement.

177
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,066
And apparently, the owner of the house
gives them meals for free.

178
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,028
They're practically lodgers.

179
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,654
Mr. Lee.

180
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:07,740
Do you like that nurse?

181
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:13,662
Hey, why are you so quick-witted
when it comes to stuff like this?

182
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,039
Why can't you be like this with work?

183
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,212
Hey.

184
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,757
Be honest with me.

185
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,592
About what?

186
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,137
Between me and that caregiver...

187
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,014
Who do you think is better?

188
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,265
For a romantic relationship?

189
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,185
I'm taller and bigger than him.

190
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:39,063
And think about
my social position and maturity.

191
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,315
Aren't I much better than him?

192
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:45,152
But you lack the most important trait.

193
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:48,364
What's that?

194
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,826
This. Your face.

195
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,246
My gosh. You little!

196
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,396
How do I look?

197
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:22,690
You look pretty.

198
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,949
I must be crazy.

199
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,997
Hey, can I talk to Ms. Park Ok-ran?

200
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,624
Yes, right now.

201
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:26,795
Come in.

202
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,505
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

203
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,258
My goodness.

204
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,428
Hello, Ms. Park.

205
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,181
You can sit over here.

206
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:42,644
Stay.

207
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:43,562
Just stay.

208
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,901
My goodness, you look great these days.

209
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,903
I guess the medicine is working.

210
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,323
Why did you want to see me?

211
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,660
I wanted to ask you something.

212
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:03,624
By any chance,
did you happen to see Mr. Ko Dae-hwan

213
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,626
in the hallway last night

214
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,420
at around midnight?

215
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,465
I did

216
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,551
go to the bathroom at that hour.

217
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:16,804
But I didn't see him.

218
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:26,230
By any chance, did you sing a song
when you went to the bathroom?

219
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,023
A song?

220
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,442
What song?

221
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:35,781
Ever since he regained consciousness
he keeps saying the same thing.

222
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,575
What was it... You know...

223
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,493
Right!

224
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,704
"Oh My Darling, Clementine."

225
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,750
He keeps saying that he heard that song.

226
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:55,634
In a cavern, in a canyon,

227
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,720
Excavating for a mine

228
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:02,266
...sang a song.

229
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,435
"Oh My Darling, Clementine."

230
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,231
Lived a miner

231
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:13,318
forty-niner,

232
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,573
-I'm not a ghost.
-"A ghost"?

233
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,200
Yoo Seon-hae,
that woman who used to be a shaman,

234
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,743
keeps talking nonsense.

235
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,581
She keeps saying a ghost shows up at night

236
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,875
and sings at the end of the hallway.

237
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:34,381
But

238
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,050
I'm not a ghost.

239
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,054
Of course you're not a ghost.

240
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,099
So you didn't sing that song?

241
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,352
No, I didn't.

242
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,522
Okay then.

243
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,496
Why are you smiling?

244
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,415
It's just that

245
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,418
no one's really paid attention to me

246
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,880
even though I've been here
for a few months.

247
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,133
But now, people are paying attention.

248
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:22,763
How interesting.

249
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,687
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

250
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:42,199
You are lost and gone forever,

251
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:48,080
Dreadful sorry Clementine

252
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,082
It's that song.

253
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,460
Why do you think she lied?

254
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:57,923
I don't know.

255
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:00,676
But

256
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,679
why are you asking me?

257
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,766
Ms. Ko Mun-yeong
is Mr. Ko Dae-hwan's only guardian.

258
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:11,019
And right now, you're pretty much

259
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,230
Ms. Ko Mun-yeong's guardian.

260
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,275
So it's kind of your business as well.

261
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,069
I don't think it is.

262
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,200
Chew on this.

263
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:29,871
Chewing on something
helps you prevent dementia.

264
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:35,210
It seems like something strange
is happening at our hospital.

265
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:39,256
Let's keep this between you and me
for the time being.

266
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,427
And during that time,
I'd like you to keep a close eye

267
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:46,596
on Ms. Park Ok-ran.

268
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:52,644
You're teaming up with the most
powerful man in this hospital.

269
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,400
Are you just going to chew and ignore me?

270
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,116
What do you want?

271
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,999
KO MUN-YEONG'S FAIRY TALE CLASS
PUT ON PAUSE TEMPORARILY

272
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,641
-Where are you going?
-The Chinese restaurant and pizza place.

273
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,351
You're going to eat that much?

274
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,812
I'm having Chinese with Gang-tae,
and I work at the pizzeria.

275
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:39,024
"Gang-tae"? I want to go, too.

276
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:44,738
HARIMGAK

277
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:45,864
Here's your  jjamppong .

278
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:47,699
This is that  jjamppong .

279
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,286
It has mussels and chili pepper inside.

280
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:53,121
The broth tastes amazing.

281
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,921
Why would you come to a shabby place
like this to eat  jjamppong ?

282
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:02,672
Our mom used to bring us here often

283
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,883
because I loved the  jjamppong  here.

284
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,885
"I want to have it every day, Mom.

285
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:09,096
I want to eat it every day."

286
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,349
No wonder.

287
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:15,477
It seemed like a famous restaurant
with a long history.

288
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:18,897
Eat up.

289
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,083
Here. Eat up.

290
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,460
What about you, Mom?

291
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:41,878
I'm not hungry.

292
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,432
Is it good?

293
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:57,853
-Yes.
-Really?

294
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,274
It's spicy.

295
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,947
Holy shit! It's so damn spicy!

296
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:15,412
It's capsaicin.

297
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,164
Capsaicin can be very addictive.

298
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:20,125
It releases endorphins when you eat it
and helps you get rid of your stress.

299
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,128
But it hurts when you poop.
It hurts when you poop the next day.

300
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,796
Your butthole hurts so much.

301
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,048
It's... It's so spicy.

302
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:42,314
-So cold!
-Thank you.

303
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,024
-Thank you.
-I'll bring this back.

304
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:45,108
-Here.
-I love it.

305
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,569
Sang-tae, you're getting wet.

306
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,239
It's... It's raining. Wasn't it delicious?

307
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,492
It's sunny, but it's raining.

308
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:55,702
It's raining.

309
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:57,287
-It's pouring. I love it.
-Slow down.

310
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:01,041
Capsaicin is really addictive.
Don't you think so?

311
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,375
We had a big meal.

312
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,543
-We did, didn't we?
-Yes.

313
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,253
I wonder why it's raining.

314
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,297
-Slow down.
-It's pouring.

315
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,341
-Let's slow down.
-Gosh, we had a really big meal.

316
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:11,384
It's pouring over here as well.

317
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:12,552
Let me join.

318
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,056
Capsaicin is really addictive.

319
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:18,266
Ms. Ko finished everything
because it was so yummy.

320
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,435
It will hurt when you poop.

321
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:22,812
Has it ever happened before?
It hurts a lot.

322
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,585
Let's have coffee together.

323
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,671
Go by yourself.
My lunch break is almost over.

324
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:49,172
It will only take ten minutes.

325
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,649
Two iced Americano coffee, please.

326
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:08,566
Okay.

327
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:37,387
I want it.

328
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:58,408
Excuse me.

329
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,785
Are you Ms. Ko Mun-yeong?

330
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,582
My goodness, it's you.

331
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,668
I can't believe I'm meeting you here.
This is amazing.

332
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:11,046
-Do you know me?
-Of course.

333
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:13,465
I've been your fan for a long time.

334
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,550
Just a second.

335
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,013
Here. This is my business card.

336
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:36,696
-By any chance, is he your boyfriend?
-No, he's just someone I know.

337
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:40,617
That's good to hear.

338
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,951
Have a seat.

339
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,372
Well then,
I guess I'll join you for a moment.

340
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:55,507
Last summer, our company was
in charge of planning

341
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,176
your art book event.

342
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,928
But I bet you don't remember.

343
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:04,057
Back then, I saw you from a distance.

344
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,101
I can't believe I'm seeing you here.

345
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,519
That's what you call destiny.

346
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:09,062
"Destiny"?

347
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,064
I'm hoping that destiny

348
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:14,567
will allow us to keep in touch.

349
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,071
If you ever have time,

350
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:19,906
we should meet up for a meal.

351
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,783
Sure.

352
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:26,621
Then here. Can you write down
your phone number for me?

353
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:41,719
Dear Daniel, I hope you buy me beef.

354
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,764
Mun-yeong will be waiting for your call.

355
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:48,893
Excuse me.

356
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,603
Sir.

357
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,023
-Yes?
-I'm sorry.

358
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:56,526
But can you take a photo of us together?

359
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,778
Oh, sure.

360
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:00,196
Click on the camera icon.

361
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:07,620
One, two...

362
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,085
About your hand on her waist...

363
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,336
You want his hand on my waist?

364
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,466
Here. Take the photo.

365
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,104
You're very nice to your fans.

366
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,900
According to Mr. Lee, I sell one more book
every time I smile at a fan.

367
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,860
You should be focusing on writing,
not marketing.

368
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:41,821
And why would you give him your number

369
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:43,615
when you don't even know him that well?

370
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,117
I couldn't help it. I like handsome stuff.

371
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,327
"Handsome"?

372
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,996
What's wrong?

373
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:53,374
Go home. I need to get going now.

374
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,345
Are you

375
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,181
jealous?

376
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:10,141
Don't be ridiculous.

377
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,851
I'm late, thanks to you.

378
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:16,439
Handsome, my ass!

379
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,858
He's such a cheeseball.

380
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:34,582
How handsome.

381
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:40,672
Gosh, I'm hungry.

382
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,054
-What?
-What is it?

383
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:49,389
Do you know that man?

384
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,608
I don't want that.

385
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:04,112
No, please. No way.

386
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:08,741
You don't want that? So what?
It's my house.

387
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,994
I've been paying
half of the mortgage payments.

388
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:13,705
Don't you feel bad
for the situation he's in?

389
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,373
He doesn't know anyone in Seongjin City,

390
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,584
and he's broke
because his company went belly up.

391
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,259
Okay, but why do you have to help him?

392
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,760
Why do you care?

393
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:28,803
How can I not care?

394
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,306
He's the CEO of the publishing company
Sang-tae is signed with.

395
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,016
But we don't even have an empty room...

396
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:36,603
Mom.

397
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,356
Don't tell me you'll let him
move into the room on the roof.

398
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,069
Mom?

399
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,071
-Just split it, then.
-Split what?

400
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:50,074
You and Jae-su should
split your rooms in half.

401
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,077
Does she think my room is a chicken?

402
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,579
It's not like ordering
half and half chicken!

403
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:58,124
I have to share the room with the guy
from the publishing company?

404
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:00,001
I get that she wants more rent,

405
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,754
but she's abusing her power
as the landlady. Don't you agree?

406
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,718
Jeez, I heard he's moving in today.
I'm so upset.

407
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:12,889
Everyone around that woman,
Ko Mun-yeong, is such a pain in the butt!

408
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,976
Stop scratching. It'll bleed.

409
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,021
Sang-tae!

410
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,359
Are you mad at me?

411
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,277
I kept calling you,
but you didn't pick up.

412
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:29,072
I thought you were avoiding me
because you feel bad about slapping me--

413
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,535
Why does it have to be my place?

414
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:36,537
Because of you, I guess?

415
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:42,835
There's someone I like.

416
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:45,046
Yes, I know.

417
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,633
The unrequited love
you want to give up on.

418
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,053
But you know, Ju-ri...

419
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,556
Don't turn into a bitch.

420
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:58,810
Why can't it be me?

421
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,188
Why that bitch?

422
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,023
And I can

423
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,236
be a bitch too.

424
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,906
You're kind and sweet.

425
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,909
You should meet a guy
who will love you for who you are.

426
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,163
I'm not kind.

427
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:20,915
Well...

428
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:23,584
Most people who say that they're not kind

429
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,211
tend to be kind.

430
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,425
Gosh, whatever.

431
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,641
Both the nice girl and the bitch

432
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:41,185
are head over heels for the same guy.

433
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,445
Jeez, what? What's your problem?

434
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,238
You want me gone or what?

435
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:54,907
I heard you told her that
a copy of her book

436
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:57,243
will sell every time
she smiles at her fans.

437
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,704
An author only needs to write well.

438
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,205
She's not a celebrity.

439
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,958
Why must she be extra friendly
when it's not necessary?

440
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,711
Because of your third-rate sales tactics,

441
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:10,298
she's learned to call
just about anyone handsome

442
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,216
and make finger hearts all the time.

443
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,427
She lets a stranger
put his arm around her waist

444
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,512
and even goes out to eat
with a guy she doesn't know.

445
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:20,183
You forced her to smile so often

446
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,351
that she only raises
the corners of her mouth

447
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:24,687
and looks like the Joker when she smiles.

448
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,023
What the heck are you talking about now?

449
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:29,108
Do your job better!

450
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,028
Seriously.

451
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,870
What did I do so wrong?

452
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:05,019
A-reum.

453
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:07,563
A-reum?

454
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,484
Gosh, my feet fell asleep.

455
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,071
I'm so sorry.

456
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:17,907
That old man, Mr. Kan, kept pestering me
to play table tennis with him,

457
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,200
so I had to shake him off.

458
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,576
You must be exhausted.

459
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:26,124
How much longer do we have to meet up
in secret like this?

460
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:31,379
You know that patients are not allowed
to date one another.

461
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:35,383
There are eyes everywhere.
This linen room is the only safe place.

462
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,260
Those jerks.

463
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,139
Let's just try to make the most of it.

464
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,100
Why don't we just enjoy the thrill
until we're discharged?

465
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:49,021
I feel as though
we're in some tragic love story.

466
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:55,903
A-reum.

467
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,906
If you don't mind,

468
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,242
I want to kiss...

469
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,287
May I kiss you?

470
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,080
Oh, gosh.

471
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:25,224
Damn it. I'm sleepy.
Why do I have to change the sheets now?

472
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,226
I'm so annoyed.

473
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:33,941
She always works me like a dog
when I'm working overtime.

474
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,526
Park Haeng-ja, that old witch.

475
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,614
I'll do it later. Just get some rest.

476
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:40,823
Really?

477
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:43,201
Then can I nap here for just an hour?

478
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,453
But I can't help you
if Ms. Park finds out.

479
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:46,454
That's fine.

480
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,498
Oh, boy. I'm exhausted.

481
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,029
Be careful.

482
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,405
What the...

483
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:36,671
Just this one time. Please pretend you
didn't see anything just this once.

484
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:40,049
Gang-tae. Please, big brother.

485
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,177
From what I know, I'm younger than you.

486
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:48,599
Gang-tae, let us love. Please?

487
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:49,517
Get up.

488
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:53,271
You see, love is not a sin.

489
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,897
Patients are human too.

490
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,275
Right, it's not a sin.

491
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,151
But, it's against the rules.

492
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,489
I can't believe this.

493
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,076
Gosh, A-reum.

494
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,580
One of you

495
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,499
will probably be transferred.

496
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:18,921
Brother, please.

497
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:20,965
Do not tell your higher-ups.

498
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:23,175
Please, I beg you.

499
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:29,682
You should focus on your treatment

500
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:31,684
so that you can be discharged soon.

501
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:33,936
Once you leave here,

502
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,647
no one will try to break you two apart.

503
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,696
Damn it.

504
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:54,040
I'm home!

505
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,333
Hi, Sang-tae.

506
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,463
Gosh, I don't want to do this.

507
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,468
I'm bored.

508
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:18,356
Sang-tae.

509
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:21,484
Can't you knock? It's rude
to just barge in without knocking.

510
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,486
Hang out with me. Can you play poker?

511
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:26,113
-Oh, Mang-tae.
-No, poker.

512
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,448
Mang-tae is mine.

513
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,575
It's mine now. Gang-tae gave it to me.

514
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:30,993
No.

515
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:31,911
Mang-tae...

516
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:34,163
Gang-tae made it in May of 2007
and gave it to me.

517
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:37,124
He said Mang-tae would eat up
all my nightmares, so I--

518
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,794
I adopted Mang-tae in June of 2020,
so it's mine now.

519
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:43,506
No, that's not true.
I never gave him up for adoption, so how?

520
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,633
-Mang-tae is mine.
-No, it's mine.

521
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:46,592
No, Mang-tae is mine.

522
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:48,344
-No, Gang-tae gave it to me.
-Give it back.

523
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:49,637
-No, it's mine.
-No, it's mine.

524
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,971
-It's Sang-tae's.
-No, it's mine!

525
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,348
-No, it's mine!
-Give it back!

526
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:54,308
-It's mine.
-Please, give it back.

527
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,559
Mang-tae belongs to Sang-tae.

528
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,353
-No, it's mine.
-Mang-tae is mine!

529
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,979
-No! It's mine. Give it back!
-It's mine!

530
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,356
-Mang-tae is mine!
-It's mine!

531
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:01,524
It's mine...

532
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:55,494
Sang-tae?

533
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,623
-Mang-tae is mine!
-No, Mang-tae is mine!

534
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,167
-I said, it's mine!
-Mang-tae is mine!

535
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,460
-It's mine.
-It's mine!

536
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,336
-Mang-tae is mine.
-I told you that it's mine!

537
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,921
-No! It's mine!
-It's mine!

538
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,131
-It's mine.
-Mang-tae is mine!

539
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:09,091
-No, it's mine!
-No, it's not!

540
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:16,849
-Who does Mang-tae belong to?
-Who does Mang-tae belong to?

541
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,809
It's mine, right? You gave it to me.

542
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:19,894
We're three brothers.

543
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,645
Mang-tae, Gang-tae, and Sang-tae, right?

544
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:23,939
-Both of you.
-It's mine!

545
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,733
No, I told you that
Mang-tae is mine. Mine!

546
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:28,152
-No, it's mine!
-Mang-tae is mine.

547
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:29,904
-It's mine.
-Mang-tae is mine!

548
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,113
-Mang-tae is mine!
-Be quiet!

549
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,131
Both of you, give it back.

550
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,596
One.

551
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:57,181
Two.

552
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:00,935
Three.

553
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,311
Hey!

554
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,563
Go away! I hate you!

555
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:05,981
-I hate you.
-Hey!

556
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:09,109
I hate Ms. Ko Mun-yeong.

557
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:13,405
Ms. Ko Mun-yeong is vicious.
She's a real fighter.

558
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:15,282
Ko Mun-yeong...

559
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,325
You too. Give it back.

560
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:19,411
You gave it to me! You can't take it back!

561
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:22,289
I told you not to fight with Sang-tae.
Anyway, give it to me.

562
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:26,418
Give it back, now.

563
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:29,630
There!

564
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:48,649
You jerk! You petty asshole!

565
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:49,984
You petty bastard!

566
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,443
I can't believe that petty bastard!

567
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,160
Sang-tae, come out.

568
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,037
You should get changed.

569
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,586
If you don't want to come out,
just open the door.

570
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:20,556
You know that Mang-tae

571
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,435
can't catch the butterflies anyway.

572
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:27,980
Mang-tae can't catch the butterflies.

573
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:30,524
What did you say?

574
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,484
I can't really hear you.

575
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:38,616
He's of no use
if he can't catch the butterflies.

576
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:40,868
Exactly.

577
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:44,121
You shoved it into the drawer
and forgot about it,

578
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:46,290
so I gave it to Ms. Ko.

579
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,797
I'm sorry I didn't ask
for your permission first.

580
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,925
But when you don't need something,

581
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,970
it's nice to offer it
to someone who needs it.

582
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:02,348
"Offer"?

583
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,600
Yes, that's right.

584
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:06,352
But...

585
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:10,022
if I give all my stuff
to people who need them,

586
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:11,607
what about me?

587
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,527
What will I have left?

588
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:24,495
You will

589
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:26,830
always have me.

590
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:30,334
Forget Mang-tae. You have Gang-tae.

591
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,921
Ms. Ko is alone, so she needs Mang-tae.

592
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:36,548
Then will you let her have Mang-tae?

593
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:39,385
Yes, she can have him.
She can have Mang-tae, not Gang-tae.

594
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:45,015
She can have Mang-tae, not Gang-tae.

595
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:49,561
Yes.

596
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:53,732
She can have Mang-tae, not Gang-tae.

597
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:54,942
Yes, she can take him.

598
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:11,375
Hey.

599
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,046
I can't sleep because I'm fuming mad.

600
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,965
What did I do wrong?

601
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,134
Sang-tae said you could have him.

602
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:22,761
Mang-tae.

603
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:25,180
Mang-tae is all yours now.

604
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:30,811
Whatever. It was mine to begin with.

605
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:33,355
Try to stay calm
even when Sang-tae gets worked up.

606
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,732
-Don't give me orders.
-It's not an order.

607
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:40,362
I'm asking you for a favor.

608
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,913
But how can I suppress my anger
and stay calm?

609
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,419
Tell me. You're an expert at it.

610
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,715
I saw you do it
when I cut your hand with a knife.

611
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:04,303
Even when that man grabbed your brother
by the hair at the bookstore

612
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:08,140
and when your brother
beat the crap out of you on the floor.

613
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:11,351
You just kept it all inside
and let him beat you up.

614
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,856
How do you do that?

615
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:19,067
If I just suck it up,

616
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,572
nothing will happen.

617
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:27,117
If I let my emotions get the better of me

618
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:29,286
without thinking about the consequences,

619
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:34,333
Sang-tae and I wouldn't have
this kind of relationship.

620
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:37,794
Keeping it all inside and enduring it

621
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,548
is the only way

622
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,593
I can protect Sang-tae.

623
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:49,681
I think that's why we're meant to be.

624
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:56,563
You're patient,

625
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,190
and I'm volatile.

626
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,443
Like a bomb and its safety pin.

627
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:04,196
We go hand in hand.

628
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,157
We're meant to be together.

629
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,204
How many guys
do you think you're meant to be with?

630
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:13,830
What do you mean?

631
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,458
Why don't you go ask your "handsome" fan?

632
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:17,501
"Handsome"?

633
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:26,385
You mean, this pen?

634
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:30,305
What do you think?

635
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:32,724
Isn't it so handsome?

636
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:36,311
Just look at this shape. It's perfect.

637
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,357
But you know,

638
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,323
you're much more handsome

639
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,534
than this pen.

640
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,870
Gosh, what are you doing?

641
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:56,873
So don't be jealous.

642
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:01,587
What? I'm not jealous.

643
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:03,505
I'm sleepy.

644
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:06,592
Go upstairs and sleep.

645
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:09,094
I don't want to. Mang-tae is here.

646
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,014
Relax, will you?

647
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,731
By the way, did Director O call you?

648
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:22,899
About resuming your class.

649
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:25,068
He did.

650
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:26,486
I see.

651
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:29,823
They received many requests
from the patients.

652
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,284
I guess

653
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:34,828
they all liked your class.

654
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:31,820
My mustache!

655
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:35,365
Where did my mustache go?

656
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:37,617
Oh, that.

657
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,286
I shaved it off.

658
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:43,540
What?

659
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:45,208
Why?

660
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:47,210
Well...

661
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:48,545
Damn you!

662
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:53,133
How dare you touch my mustache?

663
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,510
You're partially responsible. Let go!

664
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:58,597
-You little...
-What?

665
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:03,852
Wait, hold on. No.

666
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,730
No. Please! No!

667
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:10,817
Ko Mun-yeong...

668
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:13,195
-You bitch.
-I can't focus because of him.

669
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:16,323
Seriously, what a pain in the butt!

670
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:16,800
You had gum stuck on it?

671
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:20,387
Yes, it was glued on it.

672
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:22,639
My goodness.

673
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:26,560
You look so handsome
without your mustache.

674
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:28,770
Jae-su, I'm glad you shaved it off.

675
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:34,442
Thank you so much, Jae-su.

676
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:36,278
My gosh.

677
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:38,363
Didn't he lash out at me
for shaving it off?

678
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:46,872
What are you doing, Seung-jae?

679
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,710
Good morning, Ju-ri.

680
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:54,462
Did I wake you up?

681
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:55,422
No.

682
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:57,883
Why are you cleaning out of the blue?

683
00:52:57,966 --> 00:53:01,720
Oh, I figured I should do something
to help out

684
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:03,722
while staying here with you.

685
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:06,266
I'll be in charge of cleaning the room.

686
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:10,604
Just pretend I'm not here.

687
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:12,397
Don't mind me.

688
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:20,906
Ju-ri.

689
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:22,949
Do you notice anything different?

690
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:25,160
You looked better with a mustache.
Why did you shave?

691
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:31,291
Here, have some meat.

692
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:36,630
Sang-tae can be a handful,

693
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:40,050
but he can draw very well,

694
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:41,760
so please take good care of him.

695
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:45,221
Then I'll make sure
there's always meat on the table.

696
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:48,183
My gosh. Don't you worry, ma'am.

697
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:51,561
I have to say, this is a feast.

698
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:53,271
I don't even know what I should eat first.

699
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:56,232
The soup is too salty.

700
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,327
Eat up.

701
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:13,375
I must say, you're very impressive.

702
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:16,878
You're still young,
yet you have your own publishing company.

703
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:20,382
I run my own pizzeria
despite my young age--

704
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:21,716
Ms. Kang.

705
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:26,429
I know I'm only paying
200,000 won a month to stay here,

706
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:29,766
but I'll get back on my feet again soon

707
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:33,436
and make sure I repay your kindness
a thousandfold.

708
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:37,023
Then finish your food quickly.
Let's put it down in writing.

709
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:40,276
My gosh.

710
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:52,539
What is it now? Why are you in a bad mood?

711
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:55,083
Why did you ask Mr. Lee
what his parents do?

712
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:57,043
He'll stay with us for a while.

713
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:59,129
I can't even ask him about his family?

714
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:02,132
It bothers me
that you seem so intrigued by him.

715
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:04,801
Because he's interested in you.

716
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:06,261
How did you know?

717
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:08,221
When you get to my age, you'll understand.

718
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:10,557
There are some things
that you just know when you're older.

719
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,268
If you know that,

720
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:15,895
don't lead him on.

721
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,065
He's hardworking and cheerful.

722
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:21,026
He seems like a responsible guy.
So why not?

723
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:24,362
Mom, you know why I'm being like this.

724
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:27,282
Yes, I know. That's why I'm saying this.

725
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:31,369
That guy won't even reciprocate
my dear daughter's feelings.

726
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:32,871
I, too, hate him for that.

727
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:35,957
I hate him,

728
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:38,334
but I also feel bad for him.

729
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:42,964
However, you matter a lot more to me.

730
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:47,343
You told me to keep on chasing after him
even if he rejects me.

731
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:49,679
I'm worried that
you're going to follow him

732
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:52,432
to the edge of a cliff
if I let you continue to chase after him.

733
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,235
Hello.

734
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:05,987
Oh, that's your live-in cook.

735
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:08,615
The three of you came together?

736
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:11,868
Yes, I'm here to work on the mural.
Gang-tae has his day shift,

737
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:13,703
and Ms. Ko has her class.

738
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:15,830
-Is that right?
-Yes.

739
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:17,582
You got a haircut.

740
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:19,167
It looks nice.

741
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:22,462
He gave me a haircut.

742
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:27,884
You cut her hair?

743
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:30,887
Why did you do that?
She looks prettier with long hair.

744
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:34,808
Come over when you have some time.

745
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,392
I'll make some food for you.

746
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,021
I don't think
your daughter likes the idea.

747
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:43,733
She takes after me,

748
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:45,026
so she can't hide her feelings.

749
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:49,614
Don't worry.
Just come over and have some food.

750
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:52,158
You two can fight again
if you have any energy left.

751
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,702
Even better if you girls can make up
after the fight.

752
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:57,914
We have to go.

753
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:09,300
Do you like that two-faced girl?

754
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:11,261
What?

755
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:14,681
-Why did you cut Ms. Ko's hair? Why?
-Sang-tae, that's...

756
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:16,432
Or do you have a crush
on your live-in cook?

757
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:18,393
Stop talking nonsense.

758
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:20,019
Then why did you unlink my arm?

759
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,604
Why should I link arms with you?

760
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:23,064
Because we go hand in hand.

761
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:24,858
Let go.

762
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:27,318
The bomb needs its safety pin.

763
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:31,156
Let me... Let me join.
I want to link arms too.

764
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,826
-Okay?
-Look ahead of you,

765
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:36,369
or you'll trip and fall. Look ahead.

766
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:37,537
-Okay?
-Look ahead of you.

767
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,581
Look ahead of you,
or you'll trip and fall.

768
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:50,717
Gosh, I thought you'd be mad at me
and refuse to teach.

769
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,469
I was so worried yesterday.

770
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:57,140
Well, I heard the patients
miss my class like crazy.

771
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:58,766
Did Mr. Moon say that?

772
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:03,480
I guess he was too embarrassed
to tell you that he threatened me.

773
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:06,566
He threatened you?

774
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:09,444
He said I'd better resume
the fairy tale class,

775
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:12,113
or he wouldn't do anything
I tell him to do.

776
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:14,908
He glared at me and gave me an ultimatum.

777
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:17,202
Why did he do that?

778
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:21,164
I guess he wants to see you
even when he's working.

779
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:26,878
There's something I want to ask you.

780
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,089
Do you,

781
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:35,303
by any chance,
know our patient, Ms. Park Ok-ran?

782
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:40,391
Park Ok-ran?

783
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:42,560
Oh, her.

784
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:45,522
-You know her?
-Yes.

785
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:50,777
She's in my class.

786
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:53,947
What about her?

787
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:56,824
I was just wondering
if she was enjoying the class.

788
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:03,498
If you feel dizzy
or have trouble falling asleep

789
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,333
after taking the medication,

790
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,043
-Open your mouth, please.
-let us know.

791
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:11,548
Roll your tongue like this.

792
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:28,439
Thanks so much, brother.

793
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:30,525
For not telling Ms. Park.

794
00:59:32,443 --> 00:59:33,903
I'm still undecided.

795
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:37,365
You see, A-reum and I

796
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:40,034
promised each other
that we'd wait until we get discharged.

797
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:42,412
We have to follow the rules, you know.

798
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:45,498
We'll focus on getting better so that

799
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,292
we can be discharged soon
and love each other

800
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:49,085
as much as we want
after we leave this place.

801
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:52,213
I'm glad to hear that.

802
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:55,842
Your determination is what matters.

803
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:59,804
But to be honest, it's hard.

804
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:03,474
Unlike you, I'm not that patient.

805
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:06,019
It'd be better if I never saw her.

806
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:08,813
I see her every day,
and it's really driving me crazy.

807
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:10,898
I tell myself to just never look at her.

808
01:00:11,232 --> 01:00:13,943
But I keep thinking about her
even when I close my eyes.

809
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:19,782
Then when I see her,

810
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:21,451
I want to touch her.

811
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:30,001
Whenever I see her smile with another guy,

812
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:31,419
I get so pissed off.

813
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:39,844
Beauty and the Beast  was written by

814
01:00:39,927 --> 01:00:42,972
Jeanne-Marie Le Prince de Beaumont,
a French author in the Middle Ages.

815
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:47,268
It was only when the story
was adapted into an animated film

816
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:49,771
-that the image of...
- My head keeps saying I shouldn't,

817
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:51,356
but I can't stop looking at her.

818
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:53,608
-The story is said to teach us
- And my heart

819
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:55,318
-to never judge anyone
- can only follow my eyes.

820
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:56,736
by their looks alone.

821
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:58,321
It's really driving me crazy.

822
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:13,795
But that's just what adults
want to tell children

823
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:16,089
to discipline them.

824
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:31,062
Beauty and the Beast  is a story
about Stockholm Syndrome.

825
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:35,316
The Beast lives alone
in the castle because of a curse.

826
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,902
He holds a lady named Belle hostage
in the castle

827
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:40,488
and grooms this victim of his.
That's what the story is about.

828
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:43,324
Isn't it about a kindhearted lady

829
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:45,201
being locked in a castle
instead of her father

830
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:47,078
and helping the Beast
remove the curse on him

831
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:49,664
because she falls in love with him?

832
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:55,670
The Beast is usually selfish
and harsh on Belle.

833
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:58,506
So doing something nice
once in a blue moon

834
01:01:58,589 --> 01:02:00,591
and gazing at her
with a faint smile on his face

835
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:04,512
was enough to move the naive lady, Belle.

836
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:08,099
"Yes.

837
01:02:09,183 --> 01:02:12,979
The Beast is lonely.
I should embrace him with my love.

838
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:16,607
Only I can change him."

839
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:20,027
But Belle was being delusional.

840
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:21,195
Correct.

841
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:24,323
No!

842
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:26,784
-A-reum!
- Beauty and the Beast

843
01:02:27,034 --> 01:02:29,579
isn't some crude story
about the Beast grooming his victim.

844
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:32,457
-Then what is it?
-The Beast

845
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:34,792
turns into a prince

846
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:38,629
because of the power of Belle's true love.

847
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:41,507
Belle's love

848
01:02:41,966 --> 01:02:44,510
calmed the Beast's violent nature.

849
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:46,929
That love

850
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:50,433
embraced his wounded soul.

851
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:54,562
The greatest thing anyone can do
as a human being...

852
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:58,316
It's...

853
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:00,777
pure love.

854
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,528
Hey, I'm about to puke.

855
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:05,907
The drugs must be wearing off.
Did you take your medication?

856
01:03:10,536 --> 01:03:11,621
That love

857
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:14,749
embraced his wounded soul.

858
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:23,299
Love?

859
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:31,599
It is a flower

860
01:03:31,682 --> 01:03:36,312
It is a flower

861
01:03:36,395 --> 01:03:41,359
It is a flower

862
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:43,444
Oh, my.

863
01:03:43,945 --> 01:03:45,696
This really is a work of art.

864
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,073
Hello!

865
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:48,241
Hello.

866
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,870
This mural totally
brightened up the space.

867
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:55,957
When did you learn to paint so well?

868
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:59,502
I was born with the talent.
It's a natural-born talent.

869
01:03:59,585 --> 01:04:01,087
I never had to learn it.

870
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:02,797
-Oh, you were born with it.
-Yes.

871
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:06,008
My gosh, I really envy those
who can draw or paint well.

872
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:07,343
Yes.

873
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:11,848
May I paint a little flower right here?

874
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:13,349
No! Don't touch it.

875
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:16,477
Don't touch my brush.
Don't touch my mural.

876
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:18,604
Oh, okay. I won't touch it.

877
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:21,065
-Okay.
-I won't touch any of this.

878
01:04:21,148 --> 01:04:22,733
It is a flower

879
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:25,069
Even if it blooms in the mountains

880
01:04:25,152 --> 01:04:26,821
- It is a flower
-What are you listening to?

881
01:04:26,904 --> 01:04:28,990
It is a flower

882
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:31,158
-"It's all Flowers"?
-Yes.

883
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:33,494
I love that song.

884
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:34,954
Even if it blooms in the mountains

885
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:36,831
- It is a flower
-It is a flower

886
01:04:36,914 --> 01:04:38,124
Even if it blooms in the field

887
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:39,542
- It is a flower
-It is a flower

888
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:40,751
-Even if it blooms in the field
-Even if it blooms in the field

889
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:42,003
- It is a flower
-It is a flower

890
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:43,671
-That song, right?
-Yes.

891
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:47,341
When you're done with this,

892
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:49,385
would you like to come with me
to see some flowers?

893
01:04:49,468 --> 01:04:50,303
Sure.

894
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:52,889
My gosh, this is incredible.

895
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:53,931
You're amazing.

896
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:54,849
Thank you.

897
01:05:15,536 --> 01:05:17,997
Will Ms. Lee A-reum be okay?

898
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,001
She agreed to meet him.

899
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:24,754
Mr. O is in there with her,
so let's see how it goes.

900
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:27,048
I heard he used to hit her.

901
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:30,092
Why visit her when they're divorced?
He has no shame.

902
01:05:30,843 --> 01:05:33,387
Anyway, Ms. Lee is too nice.

903
01:05:33,721 --> 01:05:35,222
Why would she even see him?

904
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:37,975
They went to middle school together.

905
01:05:39,143 --> 01:05:41,228
They've known each other
for more than half their lives

906
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:43,814
if we include the three years
they were married to one another.

907
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:46,317
I'm sure it's hard to just sever all ties.

908
01:05:47,568 --> 01:05:50,154
This is why grooming is scary.

909
01:05:51,405 --> 01:05:53,324
Ms. Ko was so right.

910
01:06:06,837 --> 01:06:08,506
A-reum! Wait, A-reum!

911
01:06:08,589 --> 01:06:09,590
A-reum.

912
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:10,675
Let go.

913
01:06:11,342 --> 01:06:12,760
Don't visit me ever again.

914
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:14,387
I'm sorry for everything.

915
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:15,304
Let's start over.

916
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:16,931
I promise I'll be good to you.

917
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:18,975
I won't be fooled again.

918
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:20,893
Things are already over between us,

919
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:22,937
and I'll start afresh
when I leave this place.

920
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:24,105
A-reum.

921
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:26,816
Think about the times
when we were happy together.

922
01:06:26,899 --> 01:06:28,985
If I... If I hit you again,

923
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:31,904
I'll cut my hand off. I really mean it.

924
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,531
There's someone I like.

925
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:35,866
What?

926
01:06:40,454 --> 01:06:43,958
What the hell are you talking about?

927
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:46,293
I'm going to live with him
when I get discharged,

928
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:48,462
so just move on and live your life.

929
01:06:48,587 --> 01:06:50,172
You're already seeing some bastard?

930
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:52,341
-You're hurting me. Let go!
-You piece of...

931
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:01,017
Oh, my.

932
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:03,269
I thought you were the trash can.

933
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:04,270
Ms. Ko!

934
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,734
I sure am at a psychiatric hospital.

935
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:11,318
It's full of crazy bitches.

936
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:13,112
Why don't you check yourself in too?

937
01:07:14,155 --> 01:07:14,989
You crazy bastard.

938
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:18,451
Goodness...

939
01:07:19,326 --> 01:07:21,120
Hey, get up.

940
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:23,748
I said, get up.
You're not going to get up?

941
01:07:34,675 --> 01:07:35,509
Mr. Moon!

942
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:38,012
-Just a moment.
-No, no...

943
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:45,019
Gang-tae! Stop.

944
01:07:45,102 --> 01:07:46,395
You know you shouldn't do this.

945
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:47,605
Stop.

946
01:07:49,273 --> 01:07:50,357
What are you doing?

947
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:52,359
Enough. Stop.

948
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:54,070
No! Don't, Mr. Moon.

949
01:07:56,113 --> 01:07:56,989
Please don't.

950
01:07:58,741 --> 01:07:59,784
Please...

951
01:08:02,703 --> 01:08:05,331
Don't hit him. No, no.
You shouldn't hit him.

952
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:06,707
You shouldn't hit him.

953
01:08:57,049 --> 01:08:57,925
Are you okay?

954
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:01,470
No.

955
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:05,224
It hurts.

956
01:09:47,474 --> 01:09:48,517
What are you going to do?

957
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:51,437
Well, technically it is self-defense...

958
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:52,646
No, it isn't...

959
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:56,609
-It's excessive use of force--
-Whatever the reason,

960
01:09:56,692 --> 01:10:00,237
a caregiver punched a visitor,
so he should be punished.

961
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:03,282
If A-reum hadn't stepped in,
it could have been much worse.

962
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:05,075
And it's not just about Mr. Moon

963
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:07,036
-but the honor of the hospital--
-You heard her, right?

964
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:09,330
Try to justify yourself.

965
01:10:10,789 --> 01:10:12,166
I'm sorry. My brother...

966
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:15,878
I'm sorry. My brother... I'm sorry, I...

967
01:10:15,961 --> 01:10:19,089
I'm the older brother
so I will give a good talking to him.

968
01:10:19,173 --> 01:10:20,966
You should've tolerated it.
Why did you do that?

969
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:23,844
Did you count to three
in your head or not?

970
01:10:23,928 --> 01:10:26,305
You should've counted to three.

971
01:10:27,264 --> 01:10:29,183
I will accept any punishment.
Whatever it may be.

972
01:10:29,683 --> 01:10:31,560
Well, firing you may be going overboard.

973
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:33,520
But reprimanding you won't be enough.

974
01:10:36,023 --> 01:10:37,608
I guess, I'll have to suspend you.

975
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,903
And you won't be paid
while you are suspended.

976
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:43,239
Yes.

977
01:10:43,822 --> 01:10:44,657
Go pack your things.

978
01:10:49,036 --> 01:10:50,621
Hey, are you on drugs? Or are you drunk?

979
01:10:50,704 --> 01:10:52,831
Why did you punch him?
He's definitely going to sue you.

980
01:10:53,999 --> 01:10:54,917
Why did you do that?

981
01:10:56,043 --> 01:10:58,087
You are good at keeping it
all inside and enduring it.

982
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:04,593
Bye.

983
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:12,726
Gang-tae.

984
01:11:17,022 --> 01:11:19,358
Are you really leaving? Just like that?

985
01:11:21,193 --> 01:11:22,611
Can't you say you're sorry

986
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:24,321
and that it was a mistake?

987
01:11:24,405 --> 01:11:25,406
It wasn't...

988
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:27,533
a mistake.

989
01:11:45,843 --> 01:11:46,677
Mr. Moon.

990
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:49,054
You were so cool.

991
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:50,222
You rock!

992
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,559
Oh no. It's all because of that jerk.

993
01:11:53,851 --> 01:11:56,395
Gang-tae, come back soon, okay?
We'll be waiting for you.

994
01:12:02,609 --> 01:12:03,444
Mr. Moon...

995
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:10,284
Why is he smiling?

996
01:12:10,951 --> 01:12:11,952
No, he isn't.

997
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:14,496
He got suspended.
He's probably close to crying.

998
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:18,375
No. I saw him smiling just now.

999
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:38,312
Okay, fine.
When it looks like you want to run away,

1000
01:12:38,395 --> 01:12:40,481
I'll run away with you
right there and then.

1001
01:12:41,398 --> 01:12:43,609
OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

1002
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:47,005
I...

1003
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:48,424
got suspended.

1004
01:13:51,135 --> 01:13:53,178
They're not going to
pay me during my suspension

1005
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:55,722
and I'm probably going to get sued.

1006
01:13:58,058 --> 01:13:59,977
Everything is so messed up.

1007
01:14:02,187 --> 01:14:03,439
You said before

1008
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:06,567
you'll run away with me

1009
01:14:07,734 --> 01:14:08,694
whenever I want.

1010
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:15,617
I want to

1011
01:14:16,493 --> 01:14:17,744
go on a trip with you.

1012
01:14:22,583 --> 01:14:23,459
Right now.

1013
01:14:29,673 --> 01:14:30,549
Let's go.

1014
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:17,429
SPECIAL THANKS TO CHOI DANIEL
FOR MAKING A GUEST APPEARANCE

1015
01:16:00,764 --> 01:16:03,058
I feel like you are taming me.

1016
01:16:03,141 --> 01:16:05,227
Ko Mun-yeong!

1017
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:07,604
I must be out of my mind.

1018
01:16:07,688 --> 01:16:10,065
Is this the deviation
you've been dreaming of?

1019
01:16:10,148 --> 01:16:11,650
I can't come here with Sang-tae.

1020
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:14,278
I keep doing things I wouldn't normally do

1021
01:16:14,361 --> 01:16:15,779
because of you.

1022
01:16:16,363 --> 01:16:17,447
Why didn't you pick up?

1023
01:16:19,157 --> 01:16:21,034
What if she isn't dead?

1024
01:16:21,952 --> 01:16:23,412
What if she just disappeared?

1025
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:25,831
Who do you like more?
Me or Ms. Ko Mun-yeong?

1026
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:28,041
I don't want you to spend your entire life

1027
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:29,626
taking care of your brother.

1028
01:16:32,629 --> 01:16:34,631
