(Episode 15)

3
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,880
I have the design of the crossbow.

4
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,860
Nice to finally meet you.

5
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:30,500
Who are you?

6
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:35,900
Baidi.

7
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:37,780
Zhulong.

8
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,660
I, Gao Tangbing,

9
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,810
lost.

10
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:50,900
You lost.

11
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,700
Is that it?

12
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,290
This isn't over.

13
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,540
You'll wish for a quick death!

14
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,720
Does this hurt?

15
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:11,970
Does it?

(Siwencao Intelligence in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

17
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,140
Clerk Feng!

18
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,300
Clerk Feng,

19
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,440
bad news!

20
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:53,490
What's wrong?

21
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,420
You said to keep you updated, so...

22
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,180
Get to the point.

23
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,100
Wei's Qingping Plan worked.

24
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:01,990
The design of the crossbow

25
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,230
was stolen from Military Technology last night.

26
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,900
How did they break in

27
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,750
amidst tight security?

28
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,500
Last night,

29
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,630
Commandant Qiao Jun

30
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,890
caught Xun Xu there

31
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,940
at Mount Dingjun

32
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,420
with a permit

33
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,060
you signed.

34
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,220
What?

35
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,540
Sun Ling is already on it.

36
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,240
Go there now yourself

37
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,430
and get Xun Xu back

38
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,460
from Military Technology

39
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,460
at all costs.

40
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,900
No one shall interrogate him except for us.

41
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:35,940
Got it. I'm going.

42
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:36,620
Hold on.

43
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,820
Guards there won't let him go easily.

44
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,940
I'll write them a note.

45
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,940
Why would he even be there?

46
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:45,820
Maybe

47
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,470
he is an accomplice.

48
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,340
Even so, that's our internal affair.

49
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,260
The Agency will deal with it.

50
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,060
Yes, sir.

51
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:56,940
Baidi?

52
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,180
Clerk,

53
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,780
I've got the design of the crossbow.

54
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,250
It's secure.

55
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:14,190
Yes or no?

56
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:14,370
(Military Technology Department at Mount Dingjun, the Shu State)
Yes or no?

57
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,740
(Military Technology Department at Mount Dingjun, the Shu State)

58
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,420
Say it!
(Military Technology Department at Mount Dingjun, the Shu State)

59
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,660
(Military Technology Department at Mount Dingjun, the Shu State)

60
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,540
Stop!
(Military Technology Department at Mount Dingjun, the Shu State)

61
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,620
I said stop!

62
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,450
Xun... Xun Xu, say something!

63
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,070
He must know something

64
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,820
but based on what we've seen in the Agency,

65
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,770
he won't cave in to torture.

66
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,440
Enough about your agency!

67
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,540
Mount Dingjun is maximum security!

68
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,300
Without Xun Xu's help from the inside,

69
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,510
they couldn't have grabbed the design!

70
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,540
He colluded with Wuxian Sect...

71
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,159
Speak!

72
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,300
And brought this upon himself!

73
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,820
We don't know the truth yet.

74
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,880
If you beat him to death,

75
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,900
we'll never know.

76
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:45,659
I...

77
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,670
The design is gone.

78
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,620
Generals Wei and Zhang will receive the news soon.

79
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,680
Back off!

80
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:54,930
One hour!

81
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,620
That's all I've got.

82
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,590
If he doesn't start talking,

83
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,900
they'll chop off my head.

84
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,620
Then someone else will have to

85
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,100
get the design back.

86
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,280
Qiao Jun,

87
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,970
I understand that,

88
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,220
but he's one of us.

89
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,100
You can't...

90
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,460
You understand nothing!

91
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,340
Stop pushing!

92
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,180
Stop it...

93
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:19,930
Report!

94
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:20,980
Don't move!

95
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:21,980
What's wrong?

96
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,460
Chief Yin of Siwencao Intelligence is outside.

97
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,370
See?

98
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,580
What did I say?

99
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,640
Clerk Feng

100
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,270
wouldn't turn his back to Xun Xu.

101
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,060
Has he confessed?

102
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,220
Say it!

103
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,380
Speak!

104
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:38,680
Not yet.

105
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,020
Whisk him away.

106
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,290
Let no one from the Agency in!

107
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,610
Yes, sir!

108
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,230
You...

109
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,100
But...

110
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:47,730
I...

111
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,460
Step back!

112
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,240
Answer it!

113
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,740
I understand

114
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:53,810
but General Li...

115
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,180
I'm taking orders from

116
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,180
Generals Wei and Zhang.

117
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,620
What now?

118
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,540
I said no!

119
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,140
It's Clerk Feng.

120
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:13,750
Clerk Feng,

121
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,060
I'm armored

122
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,020
and unable to bow.

123
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:16,740
I hope you don't mind.

124
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:17,940
I'm here to bring Xun Xu back.

125
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,020
But General Wei forbids...

126
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,220
Xun Xu is dying, Feng Ying!

127
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,550
Chen Gong, give it to him.

128
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,620
The design of the crossbow

129
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,100
has never been in Wei's hand.

130
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,840
What...

131
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,039
What's going on?

132
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,280
In brief,

133
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,370
we were infiltrated by a Wei spy, Zhulong.

134
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,860
To seize him,

135
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,549
Chief Xun of Internal Affairs

136
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,820
and this young man,

137
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,380
our spy in Wei,

138
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,179
worked from both sides.

139
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,170
We thwarted the Qingping Plan

140
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,480
and captured Zhulong.

141
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,740
He's caught?

142
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,200
Yes.

143
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,260
That's great!

144
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,280
Is it the original?

145
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,270
Absolutely.

146
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,820
The serial number matches. Thank heavens!

147
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,420
Can I see Chief Xun now?

148
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,300
Yes. Yes, of course!

149
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:57,900
Let's go!

150
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,420
Move! Move!

151
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,140
Open it! Open it!

152
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,220
Clerk Feng,

153
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,140
gentlemen, give us a minute.

154
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,340
Let Chief Xun freshen up before coming.

155
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,380
Look what you've done!

156
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,420
I knew

157
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,580
he didn't do it,

158
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,740
but you insisted on beating him up.

159
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,820
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

160
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,660
I was simply... following orders.

161
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,060
Be patient.

162
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,660
Is Chief Xun ready?

163
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,300
Uh... almost.

164
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,100
He'll be out soon.

165
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,500
Clerk Feng,

166
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,500
had Chief Xun told us the truth,

167
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,860
we wouldn't have to be rough.

168
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,060
Why didn't he?

169
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,930
Finishing the Qingping Plan was our only chance

170
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,900
to seize Zhulong.

171
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,790
Even if one word got out,

172
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,200
that'd ruin everything.

173
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:40,940
Commandant Qiao,

174
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,460
do you have any idea

175
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,890
of the price we had to pay?

176
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,180
Clerk Feng,

177
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,220
one moment, please.

178
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,340
He'll be right out.

179
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,420
Who are you?

180
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:19,630
Xun Xu!

181
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,680
Xun Xu.

182
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,270
Xun Xu.

183
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,300
Xun Xu.

184
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,620
Xun Xu!

185
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,160
Chen Gong...

186
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,820
Is it done?

187
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:38,050
It is.

188
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,790
We caught Zhulong.

189
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,370
Finally.

190
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,300
I thought

191
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,340
we wouldn't meet again...

192
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,370
Stretcher!

193
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:56,980
Stretcher!

194
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:57,980
Go, go, go!

195
00:10:58,980 --> 00:10:59,660
Xun Xu!

196
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,080
Xun Xu!

197
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,070
Hurry!

198
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,530
Where is it?

199
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:06,770
What was Xun Xu thinking?

200
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,810
He shouldn't have taken

201
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,100
such a risk alone.

202
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,040
Agreed.

203
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,420
Had he told Feng Ying about it,

204
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,060
we wouldn't have been in such a tough spot.

205
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,300
How could he?

206
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,300
Had it leaked,

207
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,850
would you have found out Zhulong was Gao Tangbing?

208
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,340
You're absolutely right, sir.

209
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,750
Xun Xu did an excellent job.

210
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,700
Wei's plan has been foiled,

211
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:31,740
and

212
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,460
Jieting's false intelligence case has been solved.

213
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,300
Back to Nanzheng.

214
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,930
The Agency owes Xun Xu a ton!

215
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,660
When Jieting's case broke out,

216
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:08,920
I was in Wei

217
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:13,500
and a prime suspect.

218
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,460
Under

219
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,420
that circumstance,

220
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,290
I had nothing to prove my innocence

221
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:21,780
unless

222
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:23,700
I caught Zhulong

223
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:25,370
and the truth

224
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,950
would come out.

225
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,780
So, Chief Xun of Internal Affairs and I

226
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,300
put together this operation

227
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,860
by using Wei's Qingping plan as a cover

228
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,380
to infiltrate into Wuxian Sect.

229
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,610
Once Zhulong shows up to pick up the design of the crossbow,

230
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,300
we'd catch him red-handed.

231
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,060
We believed

232
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,190
that was the only chance.

233
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,060
And the operation went

234
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,940
pretty much

235
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:58,540
as we expected.

236
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:00,740
Zhulong posed

237
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,300
a huge threat to us.

238
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,220
He hid in the Agency for years.

239
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,370
We must get rid of him,

240
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,700
or our intelligence

241
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,380
and even the top secrets

242
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,690
would all go to Wei.

243
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,140
Gentlemen,

244
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,220
we've caught a breakthrough.

245
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,600
This was found in

246
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,390
Gao Tangbing's place.

247
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,820
Baidi's code-cracking plates.

248
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,140
They're duplicates.

249
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,430
How did he obtain the mold?

250
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:44,210
He's still being grilled

251
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,180
but hasn't said anything.

252
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,630
Gao Tangbing stayed with us long enough

253
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,650
to know what we're capable of.

254
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,820
Make him talk one way or another!

255
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,540
He said...

256
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,410
He said he'd only confess to

257
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:58,860
Xun Xu.

258
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,050
How's Xun Xu?

259
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,190
Is he awake?

260
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:39,330
He is now,

261
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,930
but still too weak.

262
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,020
He must stay calm.

263
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,270
I... I understand.

264
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,700
I know.

265
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:52,990
Be careful.

266
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,540
Chief Xun.

267
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,620
Chief Xun.

268
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,280
Ziming.

269
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,700
Yes, sir.

270
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,680
Is Zhulong captured?

271
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,570
Yes!

272
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:09,340
Yes, he is!

273
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,170
He's in our custody.

274
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,660
Baidi is briefing the Agency now.

275
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,160
Don't worry, sir.

276
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:17,600
Water...

277
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,360
Here it is.

278
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,420
Have some.

279
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,180
Here's more.

280
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,450
Chen Gong,

281
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:49,980
thanks to

282
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,880
you and Xun Xu,

283
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,230
the Agency and our state remain safe.

284
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,220
I'll ask His Majesty

285
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,380
to reward you.

286
00:15:59,150 --> 00:15:59,870
Thanks.

287
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:01,960
I appreciate it.

288
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,770
To welcome you back,

289
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,170
we'll celebrate it first in the Agency

290
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,170
to wash away our bad luck

291
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,070
these days.

292
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,880
A celebration?

293
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,220
Can it wait

294
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,220
until I take care of two things?

295
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,800
What are they?

296
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:25,580
I want to make sure

297
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,540
Xun Xu is safe.

298
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,500
Of course.

299
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,290
And?

300
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,150
The other thing is

301
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,000
to bring my wife,

302
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,750
Di Yue's body home.

303
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:49,610
Let me know if you need anything.

304
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:52,630
Thank you, sir.

305
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:04,609
Feng Ying.

306
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:09,170
Look,

307
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,420
this is the permit

308
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:13,540
Xun Xu forged.

309
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,220
I gave it to him.

310
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:18,990
Burn it.

311
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:22,339
Do as I say.

312
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,190
How's...

313
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,420
How's Xun Xu?

314
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,620
He's awake.

315
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,160
This is Physician Hua, the great physician from Jiangdong,

316
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:36,910
Hua Tuo's only successor.

317
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:40,730
He's out of his coma,

318
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,260
but a full recovery is

319
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,320
a reach.

320
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,380
How so?

321
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,260
Such cruel torture

322
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,640
damaged his organs, which can be nourished,

323
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,400
but also nerves in his legs,

324
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,870
which can be a problem.

325
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,540
Is there a solution?

326
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,540
I'll do my best

327
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:01,650
and hope my prescription will work.

328
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,370
He's strong.

329
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,060
Although not too fast, he'll be able to walk again.

330
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,860
Thank you for saving his life.

331
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,920
There's a chance

332
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,500
that he'll be good as new.

333
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,820
I shall

334
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,660
take my leave.

335
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:21,940
Thank you, Physician Hua.

336
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:38,830
Chen Gong,

337
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,700
we did it!

338
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,880
Can you believe that?

339
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:46,860
Who'd know

340
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:48,980
it's Gao Tangbing?

341
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,620
Those people are

342
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,220
all wearing masks.

343
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,100
I've known him for years

344
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,860
and considered him

345
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:08,460
a close friend in the Agency other than you.

346
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,160
He hasn't said anything

347
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,170
and he won't

348
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,100
until he sees you.

349
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,980
Let him wait.

350
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,730
I need to sort things out first.

351
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,050
They're a mess.

352
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,100
What about you?

353
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,100
Did Clerk Feng

354
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,970
give you a promotion?

355
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,300
He hasn't brought that up

356
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:38,760
and only said to hold a celebration.

357
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,260
But I said no.

358
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,740
You what?

359
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,580
Why?

360
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,540
Two other things

361
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,490
should take precedence.

362
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,530
One is your health.

363
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,920
I'm fine.

364
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:54,900
Really.

365
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,780
I'll recover soon after some rest.

366
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,220
What's the other?

367
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,620
Physician Hua said you need to stay calm.

368
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:10,800
Come on.

369
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,890
Don't make me guess.

370
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:16,820
Tell me.

371
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,590
You can't be too sad now.

372
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,780
Is it Yue?

373
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,440
How... how was she exposed?

374
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,510
Gao Tangbing

375
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,150
saw you and Yue in that temple

376
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,370
and tipped Wuxian Sect off

377
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,540
with a coded message.

378
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,820
I... I shouldn't have seen her!

379
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:27,590
Xun Xu...

380
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,540
I knew it!

381
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,310
It was all my fault!

382
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,620
Xun Xu, don't beat yourself up.

383
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:35,280
It wasn't your fault.

384
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:39,490
It wasn't.

385
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:42,910
No.

386
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,430
I'll bring her home.

387
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,030
I'll go with you.

388
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:56,960
No.

389
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,070
You can't.

390
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,580
Take care of yourself first.

391
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,760
You'll be able to see her once I'm back.

392
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:05,980
Alright?

393
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:11,940
It wasn't your fault.

394
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,420
Really.

395
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:18,470
With Baidi's return,

396
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,200
(Li Yan's Camp in Nanzheng, the Shu State)
With Baidi's return,

397
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:19,590
(Li Yan's Camp in Nanzheng, the Shu State)

398
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,560
Jieting's false intelligence case is solved.
(Li Yan's Camp in Nanzheng, the Shu State)

399
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,590
(Li Yan's Camp in Nanzheng, the Shu State)

400
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,380
Baidi,
(Li Yan's Camp in Nanzheng, the Shu State)

401
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,360
or Chen Gong,

402
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,590
as you know,

403
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:28,900
he grew up

404
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,060
as an orphan.

405
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,640
He's a wild,

406
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,730
free spirit

407
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,780
who used to be a swordsman.

408
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,780
I think he's an all-round talent.

409
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:46,850
You first took him in

410
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,430
as your disciple, General.

411
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:53,550
When His Majesty needed new talents,

412
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,220
I meant to

413
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:57,500
recommend him to the court,

414
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,020
but he found politics tedious

415
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,800
and bid me farewell in a letter.

416
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:03,900
Well,

417
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,810
he did follow his heart

418
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,260
like those free-spirited sages

419
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,090
of the past.

420
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,880
Still,

421
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,220
after all that you did for him,

422
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,870
it was rude to say goodbye in a letter.

423
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,520
You don't understand.

424
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,590
Chen Gong is

425
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,940
more than my disciple.

426
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,580
I'm surprised

427
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,210
that he'd choose

428
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,260
to work for the Agency

429
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,740
as a spy in Wei.

430
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,810
No wonder

431
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:44,940
I heard nothing from him

432
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,300
over the years.

433
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,940
It makes sense, though.

434
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,480
Being a spy is challenging.

435
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,300
That's exactly what he likes.

436
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:54,700
Well,

437
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,410
if he can come back and help you...

438
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,760
And?

439
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,420
Together,

440
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,440
we'll be of greater help.

441
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:19,030
(Chengdu, the Shu State)

442
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:31,330
Yang Yi.

443
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:34,650
Prime Minister.

444
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:36,380
Greetings.

445
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,420
I'm here to check on you.

446
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,150
What are you reading?

447
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:45,820
I'm reviewing The Spring and Autumn Annals.

448
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:47,680
You can't focus, can you?

449
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,550
Prime Minister,

450
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,140
you know me the best.

451
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,910
It's killing me

452
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,500
that I'm idling the days away at home.

453
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,070
By the way,

454
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,680
Zhulong's case has been solved.

455
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,210
Baidi

456
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,610
didn't betray us.

457
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,590
He worked with Chief Xun of Internal Affairs

458
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,260
and captured Zhulong,

459
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,880
who turned out to be Gao Tangbing.

460
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:19,980
He switched Baidi's intelligence

461
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,220
about Jieting.

462
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,550
The evidence of which is solid.

463
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,340
Prime Minister,

464
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,340
there's more

465
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,320
to this case.

466
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:33,740
How so?

467
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,180
I've been battling the Intelligence Agency of Wei for years.

468
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,870
Those people are

469
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,830
full of schemes and hard to predict.

470
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,700
What we've seen isn't

471
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,630
the whole truth.

472
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:49,610
Can you prove it?

473
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:53,620
It's a hunch.

474
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:12,930
Prime Minister.

475
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:14,090
Prime Minister!

476
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,700
Let me back, please!

477
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:20,660
The Agency also means a lot to me!

478
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,080
Not now.

479
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,230
Keep reading your books.

480
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:36,350
(Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

481
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:45,210
Chief Xun,

482
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:47,690
have something to eat.

483
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:50,780
I'm not hungry.

484
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:52,930
Chief Xun.

485
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,930
You've read The Scripture on Great Peace from cover to cover.

486
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:01,530
Physician Hua said

487
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,980
you need to rest.

488
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,060
I've cracked the coded message

489
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,800
between Wuxian Sect and Zhulong

490
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,060
based on Yue's information.

491
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:15,300
What does it say?

492
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:19,700
The sequence of passwords Military Technology uses at night.

493
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:23,980
That further proves Gao Tangbing's identity.

494
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,090
Clerk Feng personally designed that sequence

495
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,700
and had Intelligence Analysis send it to the troops.

496
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:33,530
I can't wait to talk to Gao Tangbing.

497
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,300
Chief,

498
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:36,800
Physician Hua said

499
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,330
you must stay in bed for at least a week.

500
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:40,700
Fine.

501
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,110
I know.

502
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,670
We should

503
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,870
follow the example of the Battle of Gaixia

504
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,610
to clamor at one side but attack the other like Han Xin.

505
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:21,770
We divide the troops in two.

506
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:23,230
(Chen Gong's Father Chen Fu)
We divide the troops in two.

507
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:23,930
(Chen Gong's Father Chen Fu)

508
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:24,500
One,
(Chen Gong's Father Chen Fu)

509
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:24,860
(Chen Gong's Father Chen Fu)

510
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,300
led by General's stand-in,
(Chen Gong's Father Chen Fu)

511
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,060
led by General's stand-in,

512
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:28,000
fights their way out of the east gate to battle the enemies

513
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,980
while you sneak out from the north

514
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:33,140
with a small squad

515
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:34,390
to Chengdu for reinforcements.

516
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,060
That way,

517
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,190
we'll have

518
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,020
a 70 percent chance of winning.

519
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,000
Alright.

520
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,180
We'll follow Chen Fu's plan.

521
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:52,080
General, I'll be your stand-in

522
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,690
to battle the enemies outside.

523
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,790
Not you.

524
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:57,780
Commandant Guan,

525
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,590
you're skilled

526
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:00,860
and gallant.

527
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,080
General needs you to break out.

528
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,890
I'll dress up as you to battle them head-on.

529
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:10,740
Please give the order!

530
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,560
Chen Fu,

531
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:13,980
you...

532
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,070
General,

533
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,470
I'll beat the enemies back

534
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:20,110
and catch up with you.

535
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,580
Chen Fu,

536
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,870
I'll see you in Chengdu.

537
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,420
You must be there.

538
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,010
See you in Chengdu!

539
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,300
See you in Chengdu!

540
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,830
Charge, everyone!

541
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:45,380
Let's go!

542
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,380
Kill them all!

543
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,490
Charge!

544
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,140
Report!

545
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,380
Report!

546
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,210
General, they broke the gate.

547
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,190
Chen Fu was killed in action.

548
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,910
Call for reinforcements!

549
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,040
Yah!

550
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,280
Chen Gong

551
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,230
is back.

552
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,830
He'll be

553
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,660
working in the Agency.

554
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,680
I fear

555
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,480
Zhuge Liang will win him over.

556
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:28,050
I hate...

557
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,450
I hate to

558
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,140
treat him as an enemy.

559
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,500
General.

560
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:21,970
You're leaving for Chengdu tomorrow.

561
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,580
Better not stay up too late.

562
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:24,970
Chen Gong...

563
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,640
of the Agency.

564
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,210
Yes?

565
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:30,620
Sir?

566
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:36,880
You know,

567
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,180
Chen Gong

568
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,940
is Fu's only child.

569
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:46,070
Chen Fu?

570
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:49,750
This is

571
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,230
the first time I've heard of it.

572
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:57,280
Chen Fu was so loyal

573
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:00,190
that

574
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,880
he died to protect me.

575
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:05,740
It's been

576
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,130
weighing on me

577
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,650
ever since.

578
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:14,940
Does Chen Gong know?

579
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,040
He only knows

580
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,810
his father died for our state,

581
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:21,530
but...

582
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,250
not the details, I suppose.

583
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,140
Troops fought with me

584
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,590
back in Zizhong County

585
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,940
are all gone.

586
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,150
Sir,

587
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,620
I can talk to Chen Gong.

588
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:42,760
Don't.

589
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,060
If...

590
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,280
he still

591
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,960
cherishes our bond,

592
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,170
he'll come to us.

593
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:58,980
Feng Ying of the Agency is sophisticated.

594
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:01,970
Chen Gong should be one of us.

595
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,310
It's up to him.

596
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,550
If he comes to us,

597
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,350
that'd be great,

598
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,630
but

599
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,469
not the other way around,

600
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:20,130
understand?

601
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,560
To restore the Han Dynasty.

602
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:00,980
What does that mean?

603
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,070
To...

604
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:03,360
end all wars.

605
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,970
To bring peace

606
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:06,910
to people like us.

607
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,500
Well said!

608
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:53,740
She said...

609
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,220
she didn't let you down.

610
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,430
Yue gave me this sword.

611
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:05,270
Huang Yu

612
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:09,210
will have to answer to it.

613
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,240
Chen Gong!

614
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:11,910
Mister Chen!

615
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:15,820
Hurry!

616
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:16,860
The hand!

617
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,110
Here.

618
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:30,980
My finger

619
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:32,730
will keep Yue company down there.

620
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,850
I won't let her

621
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,250
die in vain.

622
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,180
Why are you doing this?

623
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,700
Ever since we married,

624
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,020
she barely had any easy days.

625
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,200
I knew

626
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,900
being a spy

627
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,880
would come at a cost,

628
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,990
but I never ever expected

629
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:12,860
that cost

630
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:14,910
would be you,

631
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:16,480
my beloved wife.

632
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,140
Have you talked to Gao Tangbing?

633
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:52,450
Not yet.

634
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,430
Gao Tangbing is a hard nut to crack.

635
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,670
I won't get anything from him

636
00:38:58,850 --> 00:38:59,890
if not fully prepared.

637
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:03,120
Do you have an angle?

638
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,680
He didn't do it alone.

639
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,550
What makes you say that?

640
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,020
Do you remember Gu Zheng?

641
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:15,170
Of course.

642
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,210
If Yin Ji were Zhulong,

643
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:19,050
I wouldn't have this question,

644
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:22,090
but it's Gao Tangbing of all.

645
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,830
Someone in Operations could've

646
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:27,780
used Gu Zheng,

647
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,440
but not those in Intelligence Analysis.

648
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,740
As a matter of fact,

649
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,750
Gao Tangbing couldn't have known him.

650
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:35,090
And Gu Zheng

651
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,690
certainly wouldn't take orders from Intelligence Analysis.

652
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:41,390
Are you saying

653
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:44,230
Yin Ji was Gao Tangbing's accomplice?

654
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:44,890
No.

655
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:48,740
Clerk Feng was.

656
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:51,670
That doesn't make sense.

657
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:57,600
Had he been a Wei spy,

658
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,940
Di Yue and I

659
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,560
would've been made it long ago.

660
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,040
Not him.

661
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,390
He's not a spy,

662
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:08,160
but something else.

663
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,860
Like what?

664
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:12,780
He didn't

665
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,570
strike me as suspicious

666
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:15,650
until

667
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:17,840
he went to

668
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:18,830
General Li.

669
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,060
Power struggle

670
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,610
and treason

671
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,620
are two separate things.

672
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,620
Feng Ying is wildly ambitious.

673
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,840
He'd do anything

674
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:31,310
to climb up the ladder.

675
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,010
I believe he had known who Zhulong was

676
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,030
but let him go

677
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:37,730
and used him

678
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,260
to his political benefit,

679
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,520
so much so that he could've

680
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:43,120
leaked some of our secrets to Wei.

681
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,920
You mean

682
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:46,770
Clerk Feng

683
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,300
isn't a Wei spy

684
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:51,380
but he used that spy

685
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,850
to trade with Wei?

686
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:56,170
Exactly.

687
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,120
He might be a flawed character,

688
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:00,490
but you still need evidence

689
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:02,050
to declare him guilty.

690
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,350
I have it.

691
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,260
What is it?

692
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:06,590
I checked what we found from Wuxian Sect

693
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:07,670
after the raid.

694
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:09,570
There was a file to appoint Huang Yu

695
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,050
General Who Pacifies the South.

696
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:12,380
Who drafted it?

697
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,590
It was Guo Huai.

698
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,140
And Emperor of Wei, Cao Rui,

699
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,440
signed off on it.

700
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,760
That matches.

701
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,490
I saw Guo Huai's writing

702
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,330
on Feng Ying's table last year.

703
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:33,060
What's up, Xun Xu?

704
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,000
Clerk Feng,

705
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,730
Yangping Pass asks for immediate assistance

706
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,150
to check a group of merchants out.

707
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:42,100
Troops are waiting at Internal Affairs.

708
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:45,020
What merchants?

709
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,100
They claim that we've given them franchise

710
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:49,260
to sell our salt and tea to the border.

711
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:56,790
I know that.

712
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,350
Verify it with Sun Ling.

713
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:08,630
Think about it.

714
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,460
How did your code-cracking plates

715
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:12,270
end up in Gao Tangbing's hand?

716
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:14,070
That'd be the simplest way.

717
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:15,700
The simplest, the safest.

718
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,680
Feng Ying is a veteran.

719
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:18,980
He's skilled at such craft.

720
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:20,880
Yes,

721
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:23,820
he's suspicious

722
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:25,760
based on

723
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:28,940
your speculation.

724
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,100
But

725
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:32,890
what's his motive?

726
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:38,620
To gain credit and power.

727
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,840
He allied himself with Wei under the table

728
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:43,090
and sacrificed our spies on the ground

729
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:44,770
to get rid of dissidents and rise to the top.

730
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:45,610
Xun Xu!

731
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:54,040
Without corroborating evidence,

732
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,020
keep this conversation between us.

733
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,800
Do not tell anyone else.

734
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:06,210
I trust Ziming.

735
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,760
I didn't mean him.

736
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:16,860
(The 24 Strategies of War, The Wind Blows from Longxi)
(Intelligence Agency in Longxi)

737
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,040
(The Fifteenth Strategy Clamor in the East, Attack in the West)

738
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:23,110
Fantastic!

739
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:26,300
Finally,

740
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:27,780
Zhulong has been caught!

741
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,460
Gao Tangbing,

742
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,520
you threw me in jail once,

743
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:32,900
and now, it's your turn.

744
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,450
Enjoy your meals

745
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:36,750
in prison.

746
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:37,710
Still,

747
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,060
Sect Leader,

748
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:39,700
Huang Yu

749
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:42,170
was brilliant

750
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,740
that he created distraction

751
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,720
to steal the design of the crossbow.

752
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,750
That fire in the warehouse in Military Technology

753
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:49,890
drew away guards of the head office

754
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,720
so that they could get the design out.

755
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:52,620
Well,

756
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:53,840
those guards left

757
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:55,330
and the design was secured,

758
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,540
but someone was even smarter than you.

759
00:43:57,870 --> 00:43:59,830
Chen Gong and Xun Xu found a seam

760
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:02,290
in your seamless plan

761
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,510
to get hold of the design.

762
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:04,580
Xun Xu

763
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,630
sneaked into the head office

764
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:09,430
to help Chen Gong escape

765
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:11,190
who broke out of

766
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,590
the Shu Army's encirclement,

767
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:15,660
came back with the design and cleared his name.

768
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,230
But Xun Xu wasn't as lucky.

769
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:18,390
To cover for him,

770
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:20,320
he didn't say a word

771
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:22,920
no matter how hard

772
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:25,140
they tortured him all night

773
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:27,180
and almost died.

774
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:28,930
I feel bad for him.

775
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:29,820
Really.

776
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:31,100
Luckily,

777
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,380
they managed to

778
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,980
seize Zhulong

779
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:38,500
and reunited eventually.

780
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,060
Poor Xun Xu!

781
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,110
The death of his cousin, Di Yue,

782
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:43,940
hit him hard again

783
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:45,760
when he barely survived the torture.

784
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:47,620
How cruel!

785
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:50,380
Now that Zhulong has been seized,

786
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:53,060
what's Chen Gong's next step?

787
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:54,830
The arrest of Zhulong

788
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:57,480
doesn't answer all Xun Xu's questions.

789
00:44:57,850 --> 00:44:58,800
On the other side,

790
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:02,190
Li Yan has learned about Chen Gong's return

791
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,890
and he's waiting for him to come.

792
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:07,450
A storm is befalling on the Agency.

793
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,700
How will Chen Gong and Xun Xu

794
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:11,440
cope with that?
