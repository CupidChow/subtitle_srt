(The Wind Blows from Longxi)

2
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,800
(The Ninth Strategy, Advancing Secretly by an Unknown Path)

3
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,710
Chief Xun.

4
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,000
I checked the patrol schedule of Siwencao Intelligence.

5
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,680
It doesn't add up.

6
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,240
It's strange,

7
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,150
isn't it?

8
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,510
Yes.

9
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,860
The chain of evidence is rigorous.

10
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,840
It's basically flawless,

11
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,530
just like it was arranged in advance.

12
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,870
Who do you think it could be?

13
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,250
Could it be

14
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,930
Zhulong?

15
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,860
Baidi's code-cracking plates

16
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,380
mean nothing to Zhulong now.

17
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:01,220
There's no way he would take such a risk.

18
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,250
It's got to be someone in the Agency.

19
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,380
I'm afraid stealing the plates

20
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,950
is just a cover.

21
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,210
He is up to something else.

22
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,260
If that's the case,

23
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,130
it would be horrendous.

24
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,150
Although I've signed

25
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,730
the investigation on Clerk Feng,

26
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,400
I don't think he is the killer.

27
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,850
No matter who is behind this,

28
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:28,760
we have to find the real killer.

29
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,020
This is the top priority!

30
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,240
Chief Xun!

31
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,060
Chief Xun.

32
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,530
Liao Hui...

33
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,090
Is dead.

34
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,190
He got murdered.

35
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,340
He died for me?

36
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,620
It has nothing to do with you.

37
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:49,120
If my father-in-law had not been ill

38
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,180
and I had not asked for leave and gone back to my hometown,

39
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,260
I should have been the one who died.

40
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,500
What's the matter?

41
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:26,530
Chief Sun.

42
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,940
General Hu ordered us

43
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,090
to have you arrested.

44
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,820
Huh?

45
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,380
Take him away.

46
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,210
Wait!

47
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,760
Siwencao Intelligence

48
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,060
messed it up this time.

49
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:49,790
Is Feng Ying

50
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,710
really involved with Wei spies?

51
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,040
Yang Yi

52
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,630
will die without a grave.

53
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,430
But the case hasn't been solved yet.

54
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,290
There is no conclusive evidence.

55
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:59,830
Wenjin.

56
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,400
That's why

57
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,920
I'm going to tell you something.

58
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,120
Even if this case comes to light

59
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,670
and it turns out it has nothing to do with Clerk Feng,

60
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,650
it will still be too late!

61
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,400
Well, in your opinion,

62
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,570
where is the way out

63
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,500
for us old staff in Siwencao Intelligence?

64
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,530
Considering where we are now,

65
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:32,880
I'm afraid

66
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,250
we have to think about...

67
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:37,600
You mean...

68
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,380
Abandon Clerk Feng

69
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,180
and turn to Clerk Li?

70
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:43,870
What do you think?

71
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,790
Clerk Feng has been good to us.

72
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:49,650
I don't think

73
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:52,240
that's the right thing to do.

74
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,060
Tangbing.

75
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,400
Wise men suit their actions to time.

76
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,540
My brother.

77
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,590
You've seen Liao Hui?

78
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,200
It's terrible.

79
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,580
You've handled a lot of these cases.

80
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,650
Check this out.

81
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,040
Liao Hui was lying here.

82
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,909
He was stabbed right in the heart.

83
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,170
He was killed instantly.

84
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,290
Did you find the weapon?

85
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:38,450
It was in the corner.

86
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,120
The killer didn't take it.

87
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,340
But it was treated.

88
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:45,450
There's no trace on it.

89
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,510
It was a frontal attack.

90
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,450
Liao Hui is skillful in martial arts.

91
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,990
How did he get fatally stabbed?

92
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,409
There is one possibility.

93
00:06:58,659 --> 00:06:59,450
They're acquainted?

94
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,670
Yes.

95
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,230
That's why Liao Hui was caught off guard.

96
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,660
There was no sign of a struggle.

97
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,230
Is there any other clue?

98
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,780
General Hu Zhong's men

99
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,400
destroyed the whole scene.

100
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,820
Even if there was a clue,

101
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,420
we wouldn't find it.

102
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:36,650
Say it.

103
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,940
Did you help Feng Ying

104
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,790
steal Baidi's code-cracking plates?

105
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,400
You have wronged me!

106
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,820
They had been kept in the storeroom.

107
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,970
I didn't know anything!

108
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,820
I protest!

109
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,090
I protest!

110
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,000
You protest?

111
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,420
You'll be sorry for that.

112
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:04,770
No... no...

113
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,500
As long as you confess that Feng Ying stole it,

114
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,680
you can leave.

115
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,410
You are trying to frame him.

116
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,350
There is no way

117
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,930
that Clerk Feng stole the plates.

118
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,490
You're stubborn, aren't you?

119
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,710
It rained heavily yesterday,

120
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,540
so

121
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,620
the Agency was closed early.

122
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:32,020
I think the gate was locked two hours earlier.

123
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:33,360
After the gate was locked,

124
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,340
only Clerk Feng got in and out?

125
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,130
Yeah, that's for sure.

126
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,539
Because every entry or exit

127
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,200
must be registered

128
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,620
after the gate is closed.

129
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,780
Is it possible

130
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,050
that someone got in over the wall?

131
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,010
No way.

132
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,390
Although it rained heavily yesterday,

133
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,570
we were still on patrol

134
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,220
as usual.

135
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:53,780
What's more,

136
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:54,570
we also

137
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,320
put extra men on alert on the tower.

138
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,230
I heard

139
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,510
from the coroner

140
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,200
that there was no sign

141
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,990
of a break-in at the scene.

142
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,530
Do you also think Clerk Feng

143
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,180
is the only suspect?

144
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,720
No, no, I didn't say that.

145
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,020
I didn't say that.

146
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,280
Don't be nervous.

147
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,370
Do you think

148
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:17,650
there could be any other possibilities?

149
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,300
Well...

150
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,390
That's putting me on the spot.

151
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,830
Clerk Li!

152
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,470
Thank you so much for yesterday.

153
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,990
For what?

154
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,740
Don't you know it?

155
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,470
Yesterday the Dang Brook

156
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,650
outside of the West Gate flooded.

157
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,130
There was even a mudslide.

158
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,560
Glad that you're fine.

159
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:45,810
Commandant Li.

160
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:46,910
Chief Xun.

161
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,160
Was there a mudslide

162
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,190
at the Dang Brook outside of the West Gate?

163
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,680
Yeah.

164
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,090
All the bridle roads leading to Yue City have been washed away.

165
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,730
It's blocked for a dozen miles.

166
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,290
If it hadn't been for the early break yesterday,

167
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,740
our post-horses heading for Yue City

168
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,860
would all have run into it.

169
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,040
Is the road clear now?

170
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,860
How is it possible?

171
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,400
It will take at least ten days

172
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,760
to clear the bridle roads.

173
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,430
How do we exchange information now?

174
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,280
We have to make a detour and go through the Qingshi Valley.

175
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,780
It will take about three more days.

176
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,410
The weather does give us a hard time.

177
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,430
There is nothing else. You can go.

178
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,660
Chief Xun.

179
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,570
I need you to make a copy

180
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,150
of the record of entry and exit

181
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,160
in the last two days.

182
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,020
Hold on a minute.

183
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:48,550
(Wuxian Sect, Border of the Shu State)

184
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,270
Well.
(Wuxian Sect, Border of the Shu State)

185
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:49,740
(Wuxian Sect, Border of the Shu State)

186
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,460
Say it with me.
(Wuxian Sect, Border of the Shu State)

187
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,140
(Wuxian Sect, Border of the Shu State)

188
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:53,490
Sect Leader
(Wuxian Sect, Border of the Shu State)

189
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:54,160
Sect Leader

190
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,150
ordered me to show you

191
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,220
around Wuxian Sect.

192
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:58,900
These are the visitors to our sect.

193
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:02,610
The doctrine of Wuxian Sect

194
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,330
is profound indeed.

195
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,510
Last night's dinner was treacherous.

196
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,760
Do you know it?

197
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,020
I know.

198
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,540
Huang Yu was testing me.

199
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,720
Huang Yu spent a lot on you.

200
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,060
The two elders were kept in the dark

201
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,300
till they were killed.

202
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,360
But it was full of loopholes indeed.

203
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,540
He had to kill them.

204
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,150
Fortunately, I saw

205
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,540
the acorus calamus you gave me.

206
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,080
I'm glad you remember it.

207
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,870
Of course, I remember it.

208
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,260
That was the first lesson you taught me.

209
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,010
The Compass.

210
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,120
As spies like us,

211
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,100
we pay a lot of attention to details.

212
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,430
Any ordinary object

213
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,740
can convey messages.

214
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,050
Really?

215
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,400
Bring me a stalk of grass.

216
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,590
Here.

217
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,500
It's too ugly.

218
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:52,690
How about this one?

219
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,230
Great.

220
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:55,890
I've decided

221
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,820
to teach you

222
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,980
one of my secret tricks.

223
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,510
The Compass.

224
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,230
This grass.

225
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,730
North points up, and south points down. West points left, and east points right.

226
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,380
What's special about it?

227
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,550
The longest one points north.

228
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:14,700
Smart.

229
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,210
North points up, and south points down. West points left, and east points right.

230
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,890
The one facing west is the shortest.

231
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,730
It can pass messages.

232
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,620
You can make an agreement with your contacts,

233
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:25,930
such as,

234
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,020
breaking it

235
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:28,790
means danger.

236
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,130
Or,

237
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,080
breaking it and placing it towards the east

238
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:35,960
means safety.

239
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:37,900
Isn't it great?

240
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,090
You're not fooling me, are you?

241
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,490
How come I never heard my brother talk about the secret code?

242
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,570
It's my own secret code.

243
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,740
If everyone knows it,

244
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,140
it won't be a secret anymore.

245
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,480
North points up, and south points down.

246
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,460
I see.

247
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,300
Use the simplest tools

248
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,640
to pass the secret messages.

249
00:12:59,180 --> 00:12:59,970
In this way,

250
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,870
the enemy won't get suspicious.

251
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,040
Why are you so smart?

252
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,090
It's because you are too stupid.

253
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,980
No, it's because you're too smart.

254
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,420
I took a gamble

255
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,630
when I went to see them.

256
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:17,410
In fact,

257
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,020
Huang Yu placed his men inside and outside the cave that day.

258
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,100
If you had run away,

259
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,800
you'd be dead by now.

260
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,980
Why is Huang Yu so wary of me?

261
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,170
He got some information.

262
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,610
Who gave him the information?

263
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:34,560
I don't know.

264
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,230
Fortunately, you assumed the identity of Mi Chong.

265
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,770
Otherwise...

266
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,780
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

267
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,070
Huang Yu is extremely suspicious.

268
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,190
He is worried about being set up.

269
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,450
That's why he set a trap to screen you.

270
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:50,590
I know.

271
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,990
You're here this time

272
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,390
to implement Wei's Qingping Plan

273
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,470
and steal the crossbows for Guo Huai?

274
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,780
I have other goals.

275
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,530
I'll fill you in on the details later.

276
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,200
There's also the grain depot

277
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,260
and the weapon workshop.

278
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,190
Which place would you like to visit first?

279
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:12,960
Saint Lady.

280
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,700
I'd like to see the weapon workshop.

281
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,560
Please.

282
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:22,130
This way, please.

283
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,080
How many people are there in Wuxian Sect?

284
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,070
More than ten thousand.

285
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,520
So many people?

286
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,250
It's the actual amount.

287
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,010
Two years ago, the Prime Minister made an expedition to the South.

288
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,680
Wuxian Sect took advantage of the situation and grew strong.

289
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,830
Apart from the soldiers stationed at the sub-sects,

290
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,800
there are other members mixed in other walks of life.

291
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,410
Huangsha and Xixiang

292
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,280
have almost become the strongholds of Wuxian Sect in these years.

293
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,470
Our men were ready on the periphery,

294
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,830
waiting for him to come out.

295
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,620
But he turned back in the midway.

296
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,580
I just feel sorry for Elder Li and Elder Chen.

297
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,250
What is fake can't be real.

298
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,280
Give more care to the two elders' families.

299
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:18,120
Elder Li and Elder Chen

300
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,000
sacrificed themselves for you, Leader.

301
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,630
They died for a good cause.

302
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:23,900
Was there anything weird about Mi Chong

303
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,530
during the whole process?

304
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:26,900
I had been keeping an eye on him.

305
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,210
The man is ruthless and calm.

306
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:30,380
His moves were wide and open.

307
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,440
They're the martial arts from the Jizhou area.

308
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,320
There is no problem

309
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:35,760
with his identity and background.

310
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,020
But his turning back in the midway

311
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,310
is suspicious indeed.

312
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,100
We need to keep our guard up.

313
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,380
Qingping Plan is about to start.

314
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,710
Have we got the inside information

315
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,560
from the head office of the Military Technology Department?

316
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,610
I guess it'll take two more days.

317
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,500
Qingping plan.

318
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,430
With Zhulong's help in this,

319
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,830
it will succeed for sure.

320
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,120
Even so, we can't be careless,

321
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,790
especially when it comes to Zhulong.

322
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:09,860
Understood.

323
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,380
I know it.

324
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,350
Since I came back from Tianshui,

325
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:21,940
you had been waiting

326
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:24,950
to drink with me.

327
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,390
I'm so sorry.

328
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,420
I just don't get it.

329
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,190
He is dead now.

330
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,130
Why can't the Agency

331
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,340
get a decent place for him?

332
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,400
Liao Hui was an orphan.

333
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,990
He barely had a few good days in his life.

334
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,590
He died at the hands of a villain in the end.

335
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,060
A villain?

336
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,020
Who are you talking about?

337
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,599
Ma Sheng lied.

338
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,930
The bridle roads to Yue City were washed away by rain

339
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:15,440
and blocked for ten miles.

340
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,829
The roads are impassable.

341
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,800
One has to make a detour and go through Qingshi Valley

342
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:21,230
to go back from Yue City to Nanzheng,

343
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,910
and it will take at least three days.

344
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,020
Are you sure about it, Chief Xun?

345
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:30,420
Well, there's not much evidence.

346
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,860
We only need one suspicious thing,

347
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,300
and the evidence will emerge on its own.

348
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,820
Hold him steady first after we get there.

349
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,250
Don't send him over the edge.

350
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,490
Alright.

351
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,510
Hurry up and eat.

352
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,120
He is dead.

353
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,590
Suicide?

354
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,860
That's too much of a coincidence.

355
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,550
Liao Hui just died,

356
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,240
and now Ma Sheng is also dead.

357
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,790
He was murdered.

358
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,280
It was an investigation into Zhulong, the Wei spy,

359
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:15,840
unexpectedly,

360
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,870
it turned into a power struggle.

361
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,740
Here is Huang Yu's blind spot.

362
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,230
How did you come to Wuxian Sect?

363
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,720
This is not an assignment from the Agency.

364
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,120
What do you mean?

365
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:48,850
I came here

366
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,030
on my own

367
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,280
without telling the Agency.

368
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,260
What happened?

369
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,850
A spy under the codename Zhulong

370
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,370
infiltrated Siwencao Intelligence.

371
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:03,850
I'm here

372
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:04,760
to investigate him.

373
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,660
I also overheard Huang Yu

374
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,080
mention this person recently.

375
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,110
It was he who sent a message to Huang Yu

376
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,750
that Chen Gong is Baidi.

377
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,720
He was fast.

378
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:19,540
Earlier,

379
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,150
the Jieting's false intelligence case

380
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,540
was set up by Zhulong to frame me.

381
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,150
That's why I became a traitor to the Agency.

382
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:30,860
Why didn't you explain to Clerk Feng?

383
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,910
Zhulong swapped my information.

384
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,360
I can't prove myself.

385
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,520
What's more,

386
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,700
Feng Ying asked your brother

387
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,020
to come to Tianshui and kill me.

388
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,980
You communicated with the Agency

389
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,010
through encrypted letters.

390
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,560
How could Zhulong fake your information?

391
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:54,870
That means

392
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,340
Zhulong has mastered the secret of the plates.

393
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,710
In that case,

394
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,710
my brother's investigation

395
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:04,930
will involve Clerk Feng.

396
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:07,170
Although he's in a different situation,

397
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,330
he is in as much danger

398
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,580
as I am.

399
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,360
You

400
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,680
and my brother acted on your own this time?

401
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,290
We don't have the support of the Agency,

402
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,980
and we can't let anyone else know it.

403
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,600
Your identity is mysterious.

404
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,250
How could anyone else know it?

405
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,620
I think the Jieting case has been settled,

406
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,140
so my identity

407
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:37,840
is revealed.

408
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,700
What are you going to do next?

409
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,230
Catch Zhulong,

410
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,930
then everything will come to light.

411
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,060
Zhulong is very mysterious.

412
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,280
I've been here for more than two years,

413
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:00,980
and I still

414
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:02,650
know nothing about him.

415
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,610
I'm going to make use of the Qingping Pan.

416
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,740
Because Zhulong will help Wuxian Sect

417
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:10,960
steal the secrets of the crossbows.

418
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,100
He will show up in person.

419
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:16,880
How did Zhulong and Huang Yu

420
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:18,860
come into contact?

421
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,420
Based on what I know about Huang Yu,

422
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,450
I don't think they would meet.

423
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,970
The hemp paper and the bamboo tubes used to carry messages

424
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,300
were probably burned after being read.

425
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,070
I wish I could see

426
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:36,400
the encrypted letters Zhulong wrote to Huang Yu.

427
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,750
I'll try to keep an eye on it.

428
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,560
Yue.

429
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:47,960
Be careful.

430
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,230
Um.

431
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,660
Be careful at all times.

432
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:17,380
You told me that.

433
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:36,610
Yue.

434
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:39,950
Over these years...

435
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,130
Things have changed a lot.

436
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:48,540
It has been hard for you.

437
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,550
When I think about restoring the Han Dynasty,

438
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:57,900
think about you,

439
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,820
and think about the day of our reunion,

440
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:04,330
it's not that hard.

441
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,430
Chen Gong.

442
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,790
You must succeed.

443
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:47,560
Yes.

444
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:08,920
General.

445
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:09,360
(General Li Yan’s Mansion)

446
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,960
There is a major development in the Siwencao Intelligence case
(General Li Yan’s Mansion)

447
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,220
(General Li Yan’s Mansion)

448
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:11,590
which must be presented to you immediately
(General Li Yan’s Mansion)

449
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,510
which must be presented to you immediately

450
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,300
and be at your discretion.

451
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:14,470
Let's talk in the study.

452
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,180
Sure.

453
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,540
It's Li Miao's idea.

454
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,180
I don't think it's a good one,

455
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,550
but Li Miao does have a point.

456
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:24,540
What did he say?

457
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:27,200
After Prime Minister Zhuge's more than 20 years of management,

458
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,900
the court is full of his cronies.

459
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,330
There is no room for error in this impeachment.

460
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:35,370
If there is actual evidence to prove that Siwencao Intelligence is in collusion with the enemy,

461
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,280
Yang Yi won't get away with it for sure,

462
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,880
and the Prime Minister is also hard to absolve himself from blame.

463
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,200
This decisive battle

464
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,100
rests on this moment.

465
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,950
That's the whole case Li Miao sorted out.

466
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:49,220
If we do it,

467
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:51,920
there will be future trouble.

468
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:53,260
We're running out of time.

469
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,690
Li Miao is worried that the Zhulong case will be a quagmire.

470
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,580
Even if we take a year or more

471
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,690
to investigate this case, it still might not lead us anywhere.

472
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,910
Is Xun Xu reliable?

473
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,810
Li Miao said he has a way

474
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,730
to keep him under control.

475
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:06,710
If we have this thing

476
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,750
acknowledged,

477
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,020
Yang Yi will fail for sure.

478
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:11,550
But what if

479
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:12,890
Yang Yi has a backup plan?

480
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:14,330
When that happens,

481
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:16,790
we're the ones to fall.

482
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,590
General.

483
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,990
I think Li Miao's plan

484
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:19,990
is thorough.

485
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,910
What is fake is fake.

486
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:22,950
Right?

487
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,150
This thing

488
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,140
can't be used.

489
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,820
Well,

490
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,740
I will hurry back to Nanzheng

491
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,550
and ask Li Miao

492
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,030
to stop the operation.

493
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,110
No, no, wait, wait.

494
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,280
Take things as they come.

495
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,460
Just wait and see what happens.

496
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:50,420
Remember,

497
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,760
this thing

498
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,220
has nothing to do with us.

499
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:09,510
(Siwencao Intelligence’s Detention Room, Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

500
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,500
Xun Xu.

501
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:32,370
I'm here to investigate Zhulong.

502
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,300
Sit down.

503
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,920
I remember you told me

504
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,800
you never doubted me.

505
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:56,990
I still think so.

506
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:02,620
Clerk Feng.

507
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,170
The evidence is against you.

508
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,410
The evidence.

509
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,010
I knew it was a trap

510
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:14,890
from the moment I took the case.

511
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,520
What are you

512
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,630
here for?

513
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:28,850
On the day of the crime,

514
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,790
you were the only one

515
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,980
who entered and left the Agency.

516
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,560
I couldn't figure out

517
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,920
how the killer sneaked into the Agency.

518
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:40,060
Li Miao showed me the inquisition paper.

519
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,390
The officials of the Nanzheng County Government

520
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,990
ruled out other suspects based on that

521
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,380
and believed I'm the only one

522
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,070
who had the chance to commit the crime.

523
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,960
It was the case,

524
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,480
but things have changed.

525
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,900
The day before it happened,

526
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,460
Ma Sheng asked for leave

527
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,210
because his father-in-law who lived in Yue City

528
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,130
was critically ill.

529
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,250
Thank you for your understanding, Chief Xun.

530
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:15,320
Go ahead.

531
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:18,790
When the murder happened,

532
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,200
he was not in Nanzheng,

533
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:20,820
therefore,

534
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,950
they ruled him out as a suspect.

535
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:27,050
But the truth is Ma Sheng didn't go back to Yue City,

536
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,240
which is highly suspicious.

537
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,350
Stop unloading!

538
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,910
The goods got wet!

539
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,870
Fortunately, I found the last words written by Ma Sheng

540
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,600
and they revealed the truth.

541
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,350
Actually,

542
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:44,000
all of this is a conspiracy by Clerk Li.

543
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:46,570
First, he induced me

544
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:48,640
to investigate Baidi's code-cracking plates.

545
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,370
then he took out the plates from the storage room

546
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,800
and gave them to the Internal Affairs Department,

547
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,540
and then he asked Ma Sheng

548
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,790
to hide in the Agency.

549
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,430
Why are you back?

550
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,980
It's raining too hard outside.

551
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:19,370
I couldn't go back.

552
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:21,010
I'm drenched,

553
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:22,660
so I'm back to change my clothes.

554
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:24,620
What are you reading?

555
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,320
The Spring and Autumn Annals.

556
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,150
The Spring and Autumn Annals.

557
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,040
The next day,

558
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:52,260
he left the Agency with the cart.

559
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,640
That's why there's no record of him

560
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:57,740
and no signs of an intruder.

561
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,840
He went through all this to set a trap.

562
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,040
He is indeed blinded by lust for gain.

563
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,150
Yeah.

564
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,190
Unexpectedly,

565
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,700
fate is not in his favor.

566
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:13,840
There was no way for Ma Sheng

567
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:15,780
to go back to Nanzheng at that time.

568
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,900
I knew

569
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,340
this case won't be a problem for you.

570
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,450
I just didn't expect you to solve it so soon.

571
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,750
It's kind of a coincidence.

572
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:42,420
If the bridle roads to Yue City hadn't been washed away by the mudslide,

573
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:43,810
it would have taken me more time

574
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,580
to find out the truth.

575
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,020
Miao Li is ruthless indeed,

576
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,650
and he is fast.

577
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:57,050
Ma Sheng knew he was deeply involved in this,

578
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,080
so

579
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:00,380
he wrote it down in case something went wrong.

580
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,340
Unfortunately,

581
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:05,980
he was put to death

582
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,010
before he had a chance to threaten the mastermind.

583
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,270
You came to me knowing I'm in such a situation.

584
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,130
I guess you need something from me.

585
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,560
Baidi didn't defect.

586
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,060
Jieting's intelligence sent out by him

587
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,980
was replaced by Zhulong.

588
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,470
Clerk.

589
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,150
You have to work with me

590
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:43,850
to get to the bottom of the Zhulong case

591
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:45,170
and exonerate Baidi.

592
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,650
Of course, I'll agree with you on this.

593
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,310
I'll also cooperate fully with you.

594
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:57,650
However,

595
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:00,300
I also have one condition.

596
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:02,670
Please go ahead.

597
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:07,980
You have to report to me

598
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:10,520
every clue you find about Zhulong.

599
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,380
Sure.

600
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,280
What are you going to do

601
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,180
with the West Bureau?

602
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,980
They killed Liao Hui

603
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,980
and framed their political opponents.

604
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,590
They violated the iron law of Siwencao Intelligence.

605
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:40,400
Of course,

606
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,430
this is inexcusable.

607
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,020
It's just...

608
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,840
I'll get you out of here.

609
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,100
We'll go straight to Chengdu

610
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:49,450
to see the Prime Minister

611
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:50,570
and explain everything to him.

612
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:51,420
No.

613
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:52,990
We can't take the risk.

614
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,340
It's a long-shot gamble for Li Miao

615
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,600
to set up this trap.

616
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,390
If there is an ambush somewhere obscure in the valley waiting for us,

617
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,920
you and I may not be able to make it to Chengdu.

618
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:05,340
When that happens,

619
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,920
he will throw some fake charges on us,

620
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,440
and we will

621
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,500
die without a grave.

622
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:13,710
What do you think we should do?

623
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,389
We should act separately.

624
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:33,760
(Canyon in Wuxian Sect's domain, Border of the Shu State)

625
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,370
It's a surprise to me that you restored the Bamboo Kites
(Canyon in Wuxian Sect's domain, Border of the Shu State)

626
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,280
after Chen Gong died.

627
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:40,850
Thank you, my brother.

628
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,630
Governor Guo was worried that something might go wrong on the road,

629
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,949
so he asked me to learn from Chen Gong

630
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:47,520
how to restore the Bamboo Kites before I set off.

631
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,850
Governor Guo is far-sighted indeed.

632
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,110
If he hadn't asked you to learn it,

633
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:52,139
Qingping Plan would have

634
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,780
fallen apart again.

635
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:56,650
I can restore the Bamboo Kites,

636
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,150
but I never

637
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,480
used it in person.

638
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:00,860
Um.

639
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,340
Based on the current situation,

640
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:04,550
we have to take the risk to try it.

641
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,800
We'd better

642
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,610
go take a look at the site.

643
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,090
The head office of the Military Technology Department of the Shu Army

644
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,470
is on the south side of Mount Dingjun,

645
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:15,500
and it's heavily fortified.

646
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,520
I don't think it will be easy

647
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,530
to do field testing.

648
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,240
On the west side of Mount Micang,

649
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,920
there is an area similar to the terrain of the head office.

650
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,660
If you only want to test the Bamboo Kites,

651
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,330
you might as well do it on Mount Micang.

652
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:32,130
That would be great.

653
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,250
You're considerate indeed.

654
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,260
The Qingping Plan is about to be carried out.

655
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,500
We can't afford any mistakes.

656
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,160
But I'm worried.

657
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,310
If the head office

658
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,710
is heavily guarded,

659
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,070
I guess it will be hard for us to move a step

660
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,930
once we get inside.

661
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,730
Don't worry about that.

662
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,160
We've got the detailed layout

663
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,580
of the head office's internal structure,

664
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:55,130
and we've planned out the routes and the time.

665
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:57,280
That's great.

666
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:07,200
The cliff of Tianlong Valley is about a hundred feet high,

667
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,760
if the Bamboo Kites...

668
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,220
Now that I'm here,

669
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,360
I'll do it in person.

670
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,840
I won't let our brothers in the sect take that risk.

671
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,230
You are my good brother.

672
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:23,690
That's what I should do.

673
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:36,530
Greetings to Saint Lady.

674
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,820
The leader's cloak has been mended.

675
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,380
I'm here to bring it to him.

676
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,900
Thank you, Saint Lady.

677
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:40,760
(Siwencao Intelligence, Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

678
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,310
What's going on?
(Siwencao Intelligence, Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

679
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:45,770
(Siwencao Intelligence, Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

680
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,350
Useless!

681
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,160
He was there at noon when we brought lunch to him.

682
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:00,070
There was nothing wrong.

683
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:01,130
Later, when we changed shifts,

684
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,070
we found the guard lying at the door

685
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:04,080
unconscious.

686
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,480
Get someone from the Internal Affairs Department here!

687
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,140
Get Xun Xu here!

688
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,080
It has been less than two hours

689
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,850
since the shift change.

690
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,710
I don't believe he can fly.

691
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:23,380
At around 7 to 9 in the morning,

692
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,650
Chief Xun of Internal Affairs came to interrogate him.

693
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,830
Do you want to ask Chief Xun about it?

694
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,490
Chief Xun...

695
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,980
Clerk Feng escaped?

696
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,220
Well,

697
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,650
how is that possible?

698
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,010
You interrogated him this morning.

699
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:50,780
How did he react?

700
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,600
He was still unwilling to cooperate.

701
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,260
I didn't get anything useful out of him.

702
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,310
According to the regulations,

703
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,480
it requires the presence of more than two officers to interrogate Feng Ying.

704
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:04,400
Why

705
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,180
did you interrogate him on your own?

706
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:09,100
I came to you this morning, but you weren't there.

707
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,320
The others weren't in the Agency, either.

708
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:12,800
There was one detail of the case

709
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:14,720
I had to check with him right away.

710
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,660
I didn't think too much about it.

711
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,150
It was my fault

712
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:20,760
for violating the regulations.

713
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:22,330
What detail were you checking with him?

714
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:25,940
On the day of the crime,

715
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,470
Clerk Feng returned to the Agency in the heavy rain.

716
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,110
I had to know why.

717
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,170
That's it?

718
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:32,060
Yeah.

719
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,560
There was no need to be in such a rush.

720
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,360
Indeed.

721
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,050
The case reached a stalemate.

722
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,910
I was

723
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,220
too anxious,

724
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,300
and I didn't think it through.

725
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:46,530
Xun Xu.

726
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,260
Do you

727
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,020
have a different view

728
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,720
of this case?

729
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:56,850
I don't have

730
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,540
any well-grounded views,

731
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,670
but there are too many things to doubt about this case.

732
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,770
You don't believe

733
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,160
Feng Ying is the one who committed the crime,

734
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:06,880
do you?

735
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:10,090
The Internal Affairs Department's Ma Sheng suddenly died.

736
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:11,620
There is evidence

737
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,460
that he didn't go to Yue City

738
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:14,210
to visit his family on the day of the murder.

739
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,540
Ma Sheng?

740
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:18,910
What does Ma Sheng have anything to do

741
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:20,400
with the stolen plates?

742
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,940
It's not clear yet.

743
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,540
Further investigation is needed.

744
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:26,750
Xun Xu.

745
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:30,690
Nanzheng County Government has a clear conclusion on this case.

746
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,150
We should respect their opinions.

747
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,030
Yes.

748
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,090
Don't worry, Clerk.

749
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:38,850
From now on,

750
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:41,180
I'll be more cautious.

751
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:49,080
The whole Nanzheng is on lockdown.

752
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:51,970
Li Miao informed Nanzheng County Government.

753
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,540
Garrisons have also been dispatched

754
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,960
to search the city.

755
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,390
I must leave the town today.

756
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:03,900
Otherwise, it will be too late.

757
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:05,720
Don't worry.

758
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:08,070
Chief Xun and Chief Gao are discussing this now.

759
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,030
They will come up with a good plan.

760
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,770
We are close.

761
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,380
You can tell me

762
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,080
anything on your mind.

763
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,350
Of course.

764
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:22,650
I'm always grateful for your cultivation.

765
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:24,290
I'll never be disloyal.

766
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,010
What do you think?

767
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:48,940
In my opinion,

768
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:50,840
Xun Xu

769
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:52,990
is not going to give up looking into Ma Sheng.

770
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:57,810
Send people to keep a close eye on him.

771
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,090
If there is anything wrong,

772
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:04,750
get rid of him first and report afterwards.

773
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,240
I've made orders.

774
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,530
Where could

775
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:13,690
Feng Ying be hiding?

776
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,770
He didn't have much time.

777
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,560
I guess

778
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,700
he is still in town.

779
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:24,800
The whole town is on lockdown now.

780
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,190
He won't get anywhere.

781
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,040
There is nothing left

782
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,340
at Ma Sheng's place, right?

783
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,560
I took action

784
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:34,670
before he realized it.

785
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,450
What can be left?

786
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:37,980
What's more,

787
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,430
all the evidence has been destroyed.

788
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,370
Even if he comes back alive and confesses,

789
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:43,840
he has nothing to prove it.

790
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,180
Feng Ying's case

791
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,130
won't be overturned.

792
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:51,480
Clerk.

793
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:52,700
Don't worry.

794
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,240
Feng Ying escaped from prison.

795
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,630
We can't keep a lid on this now.

796
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:06,220
Report it to General Li Yan in Chengdu.

797
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,440
Yes.

798
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:13,310
(The 24 Strategies of War, The Wind Blows from Longxi)
(Intelligence Agency in Longxi)

799
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,350
(The Ninth Strategy, Advancing Secretly by an Unknown Path)

800
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,520
Don't ask me why I look so worried.

801
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,100
My brother-in-law, Feng Ying, and I

802
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:25,730
were put in jail.

803
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:26,980
I protest!

804
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,380
I'm so wronged.

805
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:30,170
What's the use of putting me in jail?

806
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,840
I don't know anything.

807
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:34,260
Fortunately, Xun Xu didn't act like a fool.

808
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:36,090
On the surface,

809
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,810
he was attracting others' attention,

810
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,960
underneath, he was investigating the case,

811
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,080
and he found out the mastermind is Li Miao.

812
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,460
Actually,

813
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:46,430
all of this is a conspiracy by Clerk Li.

814
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:49,270
He came up with a plan to help my brother-in-law escape,

815
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,990
but there were conditions.

816
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,820
He wanted to exonerate Baidi

817
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,690
and insisted on looking into the Zhulong case.

818
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,480
He even asked my brother-in-law to cooperate with him.

819
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,970
Well done, Xun Xu.

820
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:59,180
But

821
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:01,960
what were you whispering?

822
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:02,870
Play along.

823
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,560
What do you mean by “play along”?

824
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,800
Don't forget to get me out of here.

825
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:08,270
In the last episode,

826
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:10,680
Chen Gong survived the treacherous dinner party

827
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,230
Wuxian Sect's Leader, Huang Yu held for him.

828
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:14,500
But Huang Yu is still wary of Chen Gong.

829
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:16,550
He is very suspicious.

830
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:19,020
Chen Gong has to be smart to tackle problems.

831
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:20,290
Besides,

832
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:22,180
Wuxian Sect's Qingping Plan

833
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:23,690
to help the Wei State

834
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:25,280
steal the crossbow design is about to be carried out.

835
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,760
There is no room for error.

836
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,550
Whether Chen Gong's flying tools, the Bamboo Kites,

837
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:32,290
will take off successfully,

838
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:35,990
whether Clerk Feng can successfully escape from prison and get out of the city,

839
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:37,170
please look forward

840
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:39,280
to my next secret report.
