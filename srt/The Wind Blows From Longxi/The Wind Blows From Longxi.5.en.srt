You two will set off to Shu tomorrow morning.

00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:56,980
Aye.

10
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,600
You can stay in my mansion tonight.

11
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,500
I'll treat you two a nice dinner for your departure.

12
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:03,980
Alright.

13
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:04,850
Do you want some?

14
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,760
No.

(Tianshui, the Wei State)
(Governor's Office)

18
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,660

These are the entry and exit permits

20
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,140

21
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,420

Wei as in the Wei River.

24
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,790
You can disguise yourself

25
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,490
as a businessman who commutes between Shu and Wei.

26

Mi Heng.

27
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,750
You'll be

28
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,230
Chen Wei's attendant.

29
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:00,530
Aye.

30
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,250
If it hadn't been for Zhulong's new intelligence,

31
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,870
we wouldn't have known

32
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,900
that the Shu army has

33
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,040
such powerful weapon.

34
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,200
So,

35
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,450
the Commander is determined this time

36
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:13,810
to get the crossbow designs

37
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,590
from the Shu State

38
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,870
by all means.

39
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:19,860
Chen Gong,

40
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:21,490
Mi Chong,

41
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,400
you two

42
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,460
have always been my most trusted people.

43
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,260
Here.

44
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,500
I hope

45
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,310
you can work together as a team

46
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,720
and accomplish the mission.

47
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:43,680

Report.

50
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,120
Liang Jian of the Intelligence Agency is here to see Chancellor Mi.

51
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,860
Does Liang Jian know that you are alive?

52
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,340
He's the only one in the agency that knows.

53
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:02,410
Then,

54
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:03,660
let him in.

55
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,360
Aye.

56
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,100
Greetings, Governor.

57
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,260
What's up?

58
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,600
The other day when we went on the mountain

59
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,340
going after the Shu spies,

60
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,450
we caught one alive. His name is Guan.

61
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,430
He confessed

62
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,570
that he once met Baidi.

63
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:34,940
Where is he?

64
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,200
I've brought him in the yard.

65
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,840
But… it's…

66
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,860
it's getting late already.

67
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,550
You guys need to leave early tomorrow morning.

68
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,960
Chen Gong, then…

69
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,159
shall we let him in?

70
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,890
Forget it. It's too late.

71
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,050
Not tonight.

72
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,450
Since they've brought him here,

73
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,940
we may as well let him in.

74
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,600
Alright,

75
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,220
then bring him in.

76
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:13,620
Aye.

77
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,190
Now,

78
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:16,910
let's eat

79
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,220
and drink.

80
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,740
Governor,

81
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,280
he just confessed

82
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,070
that Baidi

83
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,650
is someone who works for you.

84
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,260
Works for me?

85
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,110
Then it'd be one of these two.

86
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,130
Take a look at them.

87
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,160
My eyes are hurt.

88
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:02,680
I can't see clearly.

89
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,420
Get him closer then. Start from this side.

90
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,220
Closer.

91
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,900
Is it him?

92
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,340
I've never met him before.

93
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,190
Alright.

94
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,330
Now the other side.

95
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:32,850
Take a look.

96
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,780
Is it me?

97
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,210
You are looking for death!

98
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,550
Governor.

99
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,540
How dare you?

100
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,230
Wrong choice!

101
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,300
Don't kill him.

102
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,000
Don't just stand there.

103
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,670
Clean it up.

104
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:14,890
Mi Chong,

105
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,250
Liang Jian

106
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,740
is so reckless and abrupt.

107
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,110
Useless.

108
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,630
Last night was ill-prepared.

109
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,580
But now I can finally be relieved.

110
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,150
I didn't expect that he'd make false countercharges.

111
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,130
I was too careless.

112
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,620
I think that Shu solider

113
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,490
went for the kill to begin with.

114
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,700
You were being careless.

115
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,020
You are right, Governor.

116
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,550
Qingping Plan

117
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,900
is our priority.

118
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,170
You can investigate Chen Gong,

119
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,220
but you need to find solid evidence.

120
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:07,090
Otherwise, how am I supposed to explain to my uncle,

121
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:07,540
right?

122
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,350
I understand.

123
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,370
Thank you, Governor.

124
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,060
Chen Gong, you are dressed

125
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,430
just like a businessman.

126
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:20,590
By the way,

127
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:23,200
you have a Jizhou accent, which is rare in the Hanzhong region.

128
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,320
Don't talk too much.

129
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,110
I'll take care of the communication.

130
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,150
Don't worry.

131
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,020
I've said

132
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,060
all I wanted to say last night.

When you get the crossbow designs,

134
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,970
Chen Gong, I need you to come back to Tianshui,

135
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,300
and Mi Chong,

136
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,420
you will stay in Hanzhong

137
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,300
to assemble the members of the Wuxian Sect.

138
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,550
Aye.

139
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:43,970
Go ahead.

140
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:55,940
Take good care.

(Chief Clerk of Siwencao, the Shu State)

149

During the Prime Minster's Northern Expedition,

150
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,050
he conquered three counties.

151
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,730
But Yang Yi was too ambitious

152
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,340
and overanxious for success.

153
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,890
He ordered the local spies to work in the open.

154
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,030
After we lost the battle,

155
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,790
a large body of spies were exposed and killed.

156
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,740
As a result, our intelligence network in Longxi

157
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,650
was nearly destroyed.

158
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,400
And it's all because

159
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,610
of Yang Yi's neglect of duty.

00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:31,860
Please follow me.

175
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,680
And you are…

176
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,960
I'm Sun Ling,

177
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,050
with the scribe room.

178
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:37,860
Chief Sun.

179
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,140
Yes, I am.

180
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:39,730
Alright.

181
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,190
Clerk Li, I picked and prepared

182
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,920
the room for you in person.

183
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,590
It's facing south.

184
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,440
There's a wing-room over there.

185
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,870
I put a bed in there.

186
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,740
You can take a nap at any time

187
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,520
if you are tired.

188
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,250
Thank you, Chief Sun.

189
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,360
This is only my job.

190
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,430
You… You are so welcome.

191
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,980
Sitting on the other side is my brother-in-law…

192
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,520
I mean Clerk Feng's room.

193
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,200
Clerk Feng is your brother-in-law?

194
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,490
My sister passed away two years ago.

195
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,770
He used to be my brother-in-law.

196
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,430
Over there

197
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,120
is the Operations Department,

198
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,550
further down is the Intelligence Analysis Department.

199
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,480
Gao Tangbing.

200
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,030
Through the door and on the left

201
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,280
is the Internal Affairs Department.

202
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,650
My scribe room is right next to you.

203
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,460
Feel free to ask me if you need anything.

204
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,590
Let me know when Clerk Feng is here.

205
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,080
I'll pay him a visit.

206
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:55,850
Got it.

207
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,380
I… got it.

208
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,910
Chancellor Mi,

209
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,880
I think we should change the way we address each other.

210
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,030
You are my master. It's up to you.

211
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,560
Since you are my attendant,

212
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,100
I'll call you Hengzi, alright?

213
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,800
Sure. You decide.

214
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,850
The world is even smaller for enemies.

215
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,110
We never get along,

216
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,850
yet we are paired up to go on a mission together.

217
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,470
We both have our own duties.

218
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,010
I wouldn't call us enemies.

219
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,280
There's no fun if you are not around.

220
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,350
I just don't get it.

221
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,730
Why do you always

222
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,190
suspect me?

223
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,680
If that's how you feel,

224
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,420
then you should know why.

225
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:51,940
I just didn't approve the budget

226
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,550
of the Intelligence Agency you proposed last year.

227
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,300
Is that why you give me a hard time?

228
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,060
Recorder Chen, you misunderstand.

229
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:58,580
I never care

230
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,560
about money.

231
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,270
Mi Heng.

232
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,580
Don't call me by my real name.

233
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,820
That's right.

234
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,020
Looks like you are more experienced than I am, master.

235
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,250
It's my first time working in the field.

236
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,190
I'm nervous.

237
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,390
I need to be more careful.

238
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:14,740
Congratulations.

239
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,580
Being careful is the golden rule for a spy.

240
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,020
You are good at it, master.

241
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,420
Hengzi, I can't believe that you'd compliment me.

242
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,100
This is your entry and exit permit.

243
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,640
Tell the guards that the Governor

244
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,780
asked you to go to Wudu

245
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,240
to buy salt from Shu.

246
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,020
What's wrong?

247
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,100
Have you thought about

248
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,880
how to take Mi Chong's place?

249
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,110
Guo Gang has arranged a route for me and Mi Chong

250
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,540
to enter the Shu State.

251
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,360
After across the Wei River,

252
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,810
we'll go east from Wudu,

253
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,340
and then go around the Sanguan Pass heading down south

254
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,990
to go to Wuxing by taking waterway.

255
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,780
Then we'll head east

256
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,550
across the Yangping Pass

257
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,850
and enter Daba Mountain from there.

258
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,770
Is taking a boat necessary

259
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,150
from Sanguan Pass to Wuxing?

260
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,390
It's more convenient to take a boat.

261
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:07,140
Besides, we can take the two Bamboo Kites with us.

262
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,950
Mi Chong doesn't swim.

263
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:19,000
He's from Jizhou. He doesn't know how to swim.

264
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,700
It's dangerous traveling from Han River to Qinglong Shoal.

265
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,800
If the boat tracker's rope breaks,

266
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,030
the boat would definitely hit the rocks.

267
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,220
If one falls in the water, he'll die for sure.

268
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,100
Even a good swimmer

269
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,060
may not be able to survive.

270
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,820
How can you make sure that you'll be safe?

271
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,190
Yeah, it's very dangerous.

272
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,620
Luckily, I've prepared

273
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,410
an inflatable sheepskin vest.

274
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,500
Qinglong Shoal is under the watch of the Wei army.

275
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:51,440
After I get out of the water, I'll pretend to be Mi Chong

276
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,480
and ask them for help.

277
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:53,780
That way,

278
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,480
Guo Gang would believe

279
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,050
that Chen Gong has died in the Han River.

280
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,420
Even if Zhulong

281
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,980
finds out about my identity,

282
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,460
he wouldn't guess

283
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,860
that I've taken Mi Chong's place.

284
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:05,990
How's that?

285
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,090
Good idea.

286
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:10,810
Then I'll go back to Siwencao and start the internal investigation.

287
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,420
We'll collaborate with each other, and I'll cover for you.

288
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,470
Thank you, Xun Xu.

289
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:16,900
Don't mention it.

290
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:17,790
Let's drink.

291
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:30,780
Hengzi.

292
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:31,840
It's the wrong way.

293
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:32,510
No, it's not.

294
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,030
The… The path on the right leads to Sanguan Pass.

295
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,610
I changed my mind.

296
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,870
Instead of the Han River,

297
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:43,060
we'll take the landway to the Shu State. It'll be safer.

298
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:44,610
We can't do that.

299
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,470
The Governor has prepared a boat for us.

300
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,060
And we've got a carriage of Bamboo Kites here.

301
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,130
What should we do

302
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,440
if we run into the Shu army?

303
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,740
We'll abandon this carriage as soon as we cross the border.

304
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,970
Hide it somewhere safe

305
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:59,820
and let Huang Yu of the Wuxian Sect to fetch it for us.

306
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,500
No trouble at all.

307
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,510
If the Governor finds out

308
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,609
that we didn't stick to the plan, he'll be worried.

309
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,230
It's normal

310
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,790
for a spy to change plans as needed.

311
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,700
The Governor won't have a say here.

312
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,730
What? Master, have you arranged something

313
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:17,700
on that route?

314
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,349
Don't you think it's more comfortable taking a boat?

315
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,730
And we can get there two days earlier.

316
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,150
It is comfortable.

317
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,339
But I don't know how to swim.

318
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,340
If the boat capsizes,

319
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,270
neither God

320
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,730
nor you can save me.

321
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,780
Turns out you are afraid of death.

322
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:37,820
Of course I am.

323
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,410
We need to be cautious

324
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,550
when doing what we do.

325
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,220
Master, you need to learn from me

326
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,900
and be more careful.

327
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:56,020
(Checkpoint on Wei-Shu border)

328
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:34,970
Who is it?

329
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,240
Kill him!

330
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,390
Miss,

331
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,540
are you alright?

332
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,250
Clerk Feng.

333
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,380
Sorry for disturbing you.

334
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,580
Li Miao.

335
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,650
What a surprise!

336
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:04,030
It should be me paying you a visit.

337
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,640
I'm flattered.

338
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,450
Now that I'll work under your leadership,

339
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,680
hope I can have your support in the future.

340
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,050
Please.

341
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:13,890
Thanks.

342
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,740
Clerk Feng,

343
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,380
you are

344
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,460
so diligent.

345
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,500
It's no big deal.

346
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,180
I'm just doing

347
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,860
my routine work.

348
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,700
Li Miao, since you are here,

349
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,130
I'll finally have someone to share the burden with me.

350
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,020
It's my pleasure.

351
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,050
I'm ready to serve

352
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,500
and I'll do my best.

353
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,570
Great.

354
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,620
That's what I like to hear.

355
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,060
Alright.

356
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,170
Siwencao

357
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,710
has two functions.

358
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,270
One is to conduct external intelligence operations,

359
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,340
mostly in the Wei State

360
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,700
and the Wu State.

361
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,920
We'd send spies for covert actions

362
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,060
and military intelligence collection.

363
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,100
It comprises the Operations Department and the Intelligence Analysis Department,

364
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,700
which are considered eyes and ears

365
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,460
of our Shu State.

366
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,320
I've

367
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:18,060
heard about that.

368
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,210
These two departments

369
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,740
have made a lot of achievements and contributions.

370
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:24,930
The other function is to deal

371
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,640
with internal affairs

372
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,670
such as counterintelligence,

373
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,660
protecting our intelligence program, and preventing spying,

374
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,800
which are managed by the Internal Affairs Department and the scribe room.

375
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,620
Clerk Feng,

376
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,860
the external intelligence operations

377
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,150
are the key function of Siwencao.

378
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,340
Since

379
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,620
I'm new here,

380
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,150
I'm afraid I'm still unqualified for such a position.

381
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,220
Then I'll let you

382
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,660
take care of the internal affairs.

383
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,590
Sure.

384
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,260
I saw Li Miao

385
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,760
get in Clerk Feng's room just now.

386
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,240
Li Miao replaced Yao You.

387
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,340
I guess

388
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,200
they need to decide their responsibilities.

389
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:19,420
(Gao Bingtang)
(In charge of intelligence analysis)
(Chief of Intelligence Analysis Department, Siwencao, the Shu State)

390
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,060
I wonder what kind of person he is.
(Gao Bingtang)
(In charge of intelligence analysis)
(Chief of Intelligence Analysis Department, Siwencao, the Shu State)

391
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,080
(Gao Bingtang)
(In charge of intelligence analysis)
(Chief of Intelligence Analysis Department, Siwencao, the Shu State)

392
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,380
We'll need to report to him.
(Gao Bingtang)
(In charge of intelligence analysis)
(Chief of Intelligence Analysis Department, Siwencao, the Shu State)

393
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,310
(Gao Bingtang)
(In charge of intelligence analysis)
(Chief of Intelligence Analysis Department, Siwencao, the Shu State)

394
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,320
Hope he's not high maintenance.

395
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:25,790
(Yin Ji)
(In charge of intelligence collection)
(Chief of Operations Department, Siwencao, the Shu State)

396
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:26,790
Who cares?
(Yin Ji)
(In charge of intelligence collection)
(Chief of Operations Department, Siwencao, the Shu State)

397
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,580
(Yin Ji)
(In charge of intelligence collection)
(Chief of Operations Department, Siwencao, the Shu State)

398
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,680
He's in no position to judge us.
(Yin Ji)
(In charge of intelligence collection)
(Chief of Operations Department, Siwencao, the Shu State)

399
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,220
He's in no position to judge us.

400
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,660
What do you mean?

401
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:32,730
Think about it.

402
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,700
He's a layman, and he's new here.

403
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,500
I'm in charge of the Operations Department,

404
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,300
and you are in charge of the Intelligence Analysis Department.

405
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,140
How is he supposed to lead us?

406
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:39,580
He won't be able to.

407
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:40,980
He'll only be assigned

408
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,460
to manage internal affairs.

409
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:45,270
Ji, now I know why you can lead the Operations.

410
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,580
You are quite insightful.

411
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:49,250
But even so,

412
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,780
something's still not right.

413
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:52,450
Not right?

414
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:53,810
How so?

415
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,950
The internal affairs

416
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,470
are even harder to manage.

417
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,130
You mean

418
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,620
the Wuxian Sect?

419
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,520
That's why you are the Chief of the Intelligence Analysis Department.

420
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:07,530
Bingtang, you are so shrewd.

421
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,140
Ji, stop making fun of me.

422
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,300
I was just guessing.

423
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,010
I'm still not sure what you are getting at.

424
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,550
The Wuxian Sect

425
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,620
was established by the remnants of Zhang Lu.

426
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,400
They gather on the mountain,

427
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,100
and the imperial court is still torn between suppression and offering amnesty.

428
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:23,340
In the meanwhile, they've been expending these years.

429
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,060
Makes sense.

430
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:27,720
The government is not yet strong enough to wipe it out,

431
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,140
and neither does it

432
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,570
have a way of enlisting them.

433
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:32,730
My source told me

434
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:36,220
that Wuxian Sect is intended to collude with the Wei State.

435
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,620
It'll definitely pose a threat to us in the future.

436
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:40,370
That's why I think it's even harder to manage the internal affairs.

437
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,000
What are you looking at?

438
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,180
Is it something for you to hear?

439
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:07,850
Zhulong.

440
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,350
The code-cracking plates.

441
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,680
The Jieting's intelligence.

442
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:27,120
The code-cracking plates.

443
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:35,400
My name is Liu Ying.

444
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,010
Thank you for stepping up

445
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,480
and saving my life, hero.

446
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,510
It's not a big deal.

447
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,910
My name is Xun Xu.

448
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:46,720
“Hero” is overstating it.

449
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,820
I'll always remember

450
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,460
that you are my savior.

451
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,470
Please rise.

452
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,210
Please.

453
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,540
Miss Liu, where are you from?

454
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,430
I'm from Wudu, and I was

455
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,280
a musician in the Yuming Music Workshop.

456
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:31,110
The Wei army attacked Wudu.

457
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,050
Before they broke through the gate,

458
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,460
the other girls of the workshop and I

459
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,440
pretended to be refugees

460
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:37,850
and escaped from the city.

461
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,490
To hide from the Wei army,

462
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,420
I've been traveling in the mountain for over a month.

463
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,940
But we came across the bandits,

464
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:49,610
and the other girls were all killed.

465
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,350
Had it not been for your help,

466
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,110
I would've lost my life, too.

467
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,030
I passed by Wudu on my way here.

468
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:03,790
It has been invaded by the Wei army.

469
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,800
I'm afraid the Shu army

470
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,100
has abandoned the city by now.

471
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,750
Then I'm homeless now.

472
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,860
Miss Liu,

473
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,580
do you still have any family?

474
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:28,340
I learned instrument when I was little.

475
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,890
I still have a master,

476
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,620
who lives in Nanzheng, the Hanzhong region.

477
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,280
What's your master's name?

478
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,440
Zi Suiyan.

479
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,790
Mr. Xun, do you know my master?

480
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:45,460
Zi Suiyan is well-versed in both zither and flute.

481
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,560
She's quite famous in Nanzheng.

482
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,490
I'd like to ask you for a favor.

483
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,520
Miss Liu, what can I do for you?

484
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:59,090
I wonder if I can go to Nanzheng together with you

485
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:00,970
so that I can find my master.

486
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,560
Is that convenient for you?

487
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,440
Of course.

488
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:11,920
Please.

489
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,260
We are in the territory of Liuba now.

490
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:32,100
In two days, we'll get to Mian County.

491
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:34,820
The mountain road up front

492
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,130
is quite steep.

493
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:38,110
How can the carriage go… go over the mountain?

494
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:42,380
Good question. How?

495
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,430
Master, please keep digging.

496
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,040
Where are you going?

497
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:48,860
I need to pee.

498
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:52,890
Lazy.

499
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,250
Hengzi, why did you take the harness off the horses?

500
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,580
Master, you said

501
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:11,290
that the mountain road was steep

502
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,480
and hard for the carriage to go over.

503
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,900
Then let's ride the horses instead of the carriage.

504
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,800
But…

505
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,660
But… But these are carriage horses.

506
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:22,050
They are not even equipped with saddles. How are we supposed to ride them?

507
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:24,510
Then… Then let's buy two sets of saddles

508
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:26,080
when we get to the town.

509
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,260
You are a rich businessman,

510
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:28,610
remember?

511
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:03,540
Shopkeeper,

512
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:06,210
please give the best feed to the horses.

513
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:07,610
And please help us get two sets of saddles.

514
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:09,350
I'll pay you tomorrow before we leave.

515
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,170
Liuzi.

516
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,040
Hear that? Get it done.

517
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:12,710
No problem.

518
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,190
We want two high-end rooms.

519
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,760
It's war time.

520
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,270
What high-end, low-end?

521
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,700
The room next door is the only one available.

522
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,100
Take it

523
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:22,410
or leave it.

524
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:24,420
Only one…

525
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:42,230
One more day,

526
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,090
we'll get to Yangping Pass.

527
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,970
Have you contacted Huang Yu?

528
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:53,590
I have.

529
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,520
No worries, Master.

530
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:31,880
Liuzi.

531
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,160
The saddle is quite nice.

532
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:35,940
Sir.

533
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,890
Could you help me deliver a letter?

534
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,240
Sure. Where to?

535
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,860
It's quite far,

536
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,120
and it's very dangerous out there.

537
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,400
I won't let you do it for nothing.

538
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,710
I'll give you the letter later.

539
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:52,360
Sir, with this much money, I'm even willing to give away my life,

540
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:53,390
let alone deliver a letter.

541
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:55,250
Do not tell my attendant about this.

542
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,700
Keep it from him.

543
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:57,840
Listen…

544
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:58,820
Master, you got up early.

545
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:02,970
What are you talking about?

546
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,100
He…

547
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:06,190
asked for the money for the saddles.

548
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,540
How much did you pay him?

549
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,400
I paid him for my saddle.

550
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,530
Give me a sec, Master.

551
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:13,740
Where… Where are you going?

552
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,090
I haven't paid for mine yet.

553
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,570
How stingy you are.

554
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:18,890
Liuzi.

555
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,340
Sir.

556
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,410
Have you fed the horses?

557
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,120
Yes.

558
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:24,780
What were you talking about?

559
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,280
What did my master say to you?

560
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:26,930
Well…

561
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:29,920
He doesn't allow me to tell you.

562
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,060
How many times did you feed them?

563
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,290
Twice.

564
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,520
Hengzi, hurry up.

565
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,260
Coming.

566
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,060
-What?
-He asked me to deliver a letter for him.

567
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:38,700
Where to?

568
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,670
The Jinyuyao Brothel in Tianshui.

569
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:43,250
Shame on him.

570
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,460
Where's the letter?

571
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:45,790
He hasn't given it to me yet.

572
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,330
Thank you.

573
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,020
Master, it's about time.

574
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:53,910
Yeah, Hengzi.

575
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,660
It's time to hit the road.

576
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,880
I'll wait for you outside.

577
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:02,540
Alright.

578
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:33,880
(Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

579
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,990
(Nanzheng County)

580
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:35,990
Go.
(Nanzheng County)

581
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:38,200
(Nanzheng County)

582
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:40,200
Wait for me here.

583
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:41,840
Go.

584
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:45,620
Keep it quiet.

585
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,280
I was on a mission, just came back. Please let me pass.

586
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,070
Understood.

587
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:49,980
Let him go.

588
00:33:59,190 --> 00:33:59,790
Go.

589
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,630
As far as I've noted,

590
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:11,070
you are not a businessman.

591
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:14,139
I wonder if you can tell me who you really are.

592
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:16,540
Miss Liu, you are right.

593
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,020
But,

594
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,760
for certain reasons,

595
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:20,830
I can't tell you who I am.

596
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:23,719
Hope you can forgive me.

597
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,719
I can tell that you are no ordinary man,

598
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:30,940
it's just that I have no way

599
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,590
to repay you for saving my life.

600
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:37,570
This bamboo flute

601
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,290
has been with me for all my life so far.

602
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:42,420
Please take it as a gift

603
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,270
to remember me by.

604
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:54,250
Miss Liu, this gift is too valuable.

605
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,590
I… I…

606
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,460
I'm really flattered.

607
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:21,870
Then let me

608
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,680
take you to Ziyan House to find your master later.

609
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,750
You don't have to.

610
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:27,830
You've taken

611
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,730
such a good care of me on our way here.

612
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,280
I'd like to repay the favor some time.

613
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,180
Right.

614
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,730
Ziyan House is on a busy street,

615
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,160
and it's not far from here.

616
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,060
Then I'll bid farewell to you.

617
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:47,430
Hope I can see you again.

618
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:50,720
Mr. Xun,

619
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,180
please drink up the wine.

620
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:11,630
Chief Xun.

621
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:16,930
(Nanzheng County, the Shu State)
(Siwencao Intelligence)

622
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,300
(Siwencao Intelligence)
Chief Xun.

623
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:11,630
(Siwencao Intelligence)

624
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:22,860
Chief Xun.

625
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:32,390
Xun Xu is back.

626
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:34,640
It's Xun Xu.

627
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:37,360
Xun Xu!

628
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:38,500
Tangbing.

629
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,680
You are finally back!

630
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,070
I thought you…

631
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,870
You still owe me a dinner.

632
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,420
It'd be a big loss to me

633
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:48,350
if I died on a mission.

634
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,680
You silly man.

635
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:51,890
I'm so glad you are back.

636
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,140
I really am.

637
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,270
Come on, go to my place.

638
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,560
Why?

639
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:57,630
I have a lot to say to you.

640
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:58,800
I need to talk to Clerk Feng first.

641
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,000
Later. Let's go.

642
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:04,840
Why are you being sneaky?

643
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,680
During the two months you were away,

644
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,180
our Siwencao

645
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,780
has undergone a big change.

646
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:12,260
What happened?

647
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,380
Something huge happened.

648
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,660
Clerk Yao was dismissed

649
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,100
and demoted to a civilian.

650
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:20,100
A guy named Li Miao replaced him.

651
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,090
And he's in charge of your department.

652
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:24,610
Li Miao?

653
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,000
A former counsellor to the Prime Minister.

654
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:30,140
What about Clerk Feng then?

655
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,550
Nothing happened to Clerk Feng,

656
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:33,740
except that his salary is cut a little.

657
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:34,760
Why?

658
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,090
It's all because of the mission you were dispatched to do.

659
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,210
My salary is also cut because of that.

660
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,770
Yang Yi

661
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:45,630
is no longer in charge of Siwencao.

662
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,950
General Li Yan replaced his position.

663
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,500
General Li Yan is in Nanzheng?

664
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:51,410
Yes.

665
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,420
Nanzheng is the heart of the Hanzhong region,

666
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:01,500
as well as the stronghold of the Northern Expedition.

667
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,420
It's His Majesty's order.

668
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,110
Who knows why?

669
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:11,560
You just came back.

670
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,350
Be careful with

671
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,600
what you say and do.

672
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:23,750
How was the mission? Did you make it?

673
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,470
I wouldn't dare come back if I failed.

674
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,980
That's why you are the right-hand man!

675
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,190
Chief Xun,

676
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:33,560
Clerk Feng wants to see you.

677
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,060
Then I'm leaving.

678
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:37,780
Alright.

679
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:52,020
Tell me what happened.

680
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,440
After I arrived in Wudu,

681
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,800
Chief Gao briefed me the situation,

682
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,170
then I led 13 well-trained field agents

683
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,060
to sneak in Tianshui.

684
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,070
I let them

685
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:06,810
hide in Xiaolong Mountain,

686
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:08,500
and I entered the town alone

687
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:10,780
to meet Baidi as planned.

688
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:15,020
Has Baidi gone rogue?

689
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,260
I'm not sure.

690
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,870
You didn't

691
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,140
ask me to test his loyalty before I left.

692
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:25,800
Hmm.

693
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,430
Go on.

694
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,990
Baidi was highly alert,

695
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,110
so I couldn't

696
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,620
find a chance to take him out.

697
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,340
When he met you,

698
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,910
did he look suspicious?

699
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:42,910
No.

700
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:45,490
But,

701
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:46,640
maybe I didn't notice

702
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:48,990
if he did.

703
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:52,150
How do you assess

704
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,650
the damage?

705
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:56,630
Baidi

706
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:59,240
confessed how he stole the Jieting Intelligence

707
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,500
and how he sent it out.

708
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,540
He didn't talk about anything else.

709
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,510
Is there any problem with the process?

710
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,190
It doesn't seem like there is any.

711
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,390
And I met his agent, Gu Zheng, too.

712
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:18,980
How did

713
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:21,290
Gu Zheng die?

714
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:25,940
What?

715
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:27,580
Something's wrong?

716
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,330
Gu Zheng died not long after he met me.

717
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,060
And that's why

718
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,720
I decided to kill Baidi.

719
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,700
Baidi had something to do

720
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,600
with Gu Zheng's death?

721
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,350
Based on the timeline,

722
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,450
it was highly possible that he did.

723
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,280
Maybe

724
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:51,940
he feared that Gu Zheng would tell

725
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,110
a different story when he met me.

726
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:01,900
How did you kill Baidi?

727
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:04,760
In the middle of last month,

728
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,460
Baidi and Mi Chong, Chancellor of the Intelligence Agency of Wei,

729
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,390
went to Xiaolong Mountain together to check their defense line.

730
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:11,790
On their way back to the town,

731
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:14,480
they passed by Jitou Mountain, where was quite rugged,

732
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,340
so we ambushed there

733
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,360
and shot arrows to startle the horses.

734
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:21,350
Their carriage fell down the cliff

735
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,630
as a result,

736
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,900
and Baidi died at the scene.

737
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,860
Weren't you hesitant

738
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:42,700
about killing your brother-in-law?

739
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,480
I was.

740
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,670
But when I saw Gu Zheng's families were put in jail,

741
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:00,290
I then made up my mind.

742
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,200
When we were in action,

743
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,020
the Wei army found out about us

744
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:07,220
and deployed a thousand soldiers to search the mountain.

745
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,370
To cover for me,

746
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,020
Captain Jin

747
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,720
and all the men on his team

748
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,540
fought to the death.

749
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:45,910
Thank you, Clerk Feng.

750
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:51,320
Our agency has made

751
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:53,070
some changes in personnel.

752
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:56,210
You can go and pay Clerk Li a visit later.

753
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,570
Aye.

754
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:01,000
Come on, relax.

755
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:11,520
(Intelligence Agency in Longxi)
(The 24 Strategies of War, The Wind Blows from Longxi)

756
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:14,520
(Make the Host and the Guest Exchange Places)
(The Fifth Strategy)

757
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:15,510
Right now,

758
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,060
the merchant duo, Chen Gong and Mi Chong

759
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:21,220
are leaving for Shuzhong.

760
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:22,950
Well,

761
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,540
the two used to

762
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:25,980
be foes.

763
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:26,700
Chen Wei's attendant.

764
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,740
And now, they're master and attendant.

765
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:29,870
Aye.

766
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:31,540
Brilliant.

767
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,470
Before they leave,

768
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,710
Guo Gang had a private talk

769
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:36,330
with Mi Chong particularly,

770
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,660
afraid that he'd harm Chen Gong.

771
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,160
He really cares about Chen Gong.

772
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:42,660
This field mission

773
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:45,230
also gives Chen Gong a chance to replace Mi Chong.

774
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,390
Mi Chong doesn't swim.

775
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:47,580
This is part of the plan he and Xun Xu crafted

776
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:50,790
to root out Zhulong in secret.

777
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:51,580
However,

778
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:54,670
Mi Chong won't make Chen Gong succeed easily.

779
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,540
Back in Shu State,

780
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:59,060
Siwencao has undergone a tremendous change.

781
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:01,620
In the last episode, General Li Yan reshuffled

782
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:03,350
once he took office.

783
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,750
Only the Chief Clerk was vacant.

784
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:06,760
The man to fill in

785
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:08,500
is Li Miao, an outsider.

786
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:10,650
He's going to assist my brother-in-law, Feng Ying.

787
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:12,090
Does Li Yan really intend

788
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:13,940
to usurp the former administration of Siwencao?

789
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:14,700
Does he?

790
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:16,420
In the last two episodes,

791
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,140
Xun Xu made an ingenious escape

792
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:19,340
right under Mi Chong's nose

793
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,580
and left Tianshui in the Wei's control safe and sound.

794
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:22,940
On his way back to the Shu State,

795
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:23,860
he saved a girl

796
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,090
from a bunch of bandits.

797
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:27,070
Miss, are you alright?

798
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:29,710
He learned that the girl's name was Liu Ying,

799
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:32,090
a homeless musician.

800
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,020
Xun Xu escorted Miss Liu

801
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:36,370
to the Shu State to seek asylum from her master.

802
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:37,560
Before they bid farewell,

803
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:40,310
Liu Ying gave her bamboo flute to Xun Xu

804
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,180
to express her gratitude.

805
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,040
Alas,

806
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:45,220
why have I never

807
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:46,980
had such a heroic and romantic encounter?

808
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:49,020
Can Chen Gong, codenamed Baidi,

809
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:51,340
implement his plan

810
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,120
before he and Mi Chong reach Wuxian Sect?

811
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:53,870
How will Xun Xu

812
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:55,480
report to Siwencao Intelligence

813
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:57,780
on Baidi's betrayal?

814
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,190
I'll give you the answers next time.
