He's waiting for you in Yangxin Chamber.

10
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:47,780
I never expected to see

11
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,580
such a beautiful house in Nanzheng County.

12
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:52,259
Do you like it?

13
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,729
Yes, of course.

14
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,490
If you like it,

15
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,460
you can also move in.

16
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,400
Are you sure?

17
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,000
Sure.

18
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,300
Why would I lie to you?

19
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,620
Thank you, Clerk Feng.

20
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,830
I'm quite happy.

21
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,360
Are you insane?

22
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,720
You'll get me killed, you know?

23
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,050
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,530
Be serious.

25
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:18,740
I just don't know

26
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,140
what else I can do to thank you, Clerk Feng.

27
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,930
Please don't blame me.

28
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,860
If you can sometimes tell me

29
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,300
what you see and hear,

30
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,990
you'll be expressing your gratitude.

31
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,220
Don't worry.

32
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,780
I'm grateful to you.

33
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,200
I'll always be loyal to you, Clerk Feng.

34
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,140
Unless you want to be killed,

35
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,870
keep such thoughts in your mind

36
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,200
and never bring them up again.

37
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,430
I'll keep it in mind.

38
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,130
Bravo!

39
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,170
General, you played the song

40
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,220
as well as the God of Zither.

41
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,130
It sounded so beautiful

42
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,660
and no one could play better than you.

43
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,430
Miss Liu.

44
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:55,390
Miss Liu, you're my soul mate.

45
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,190
Don't bother to kneel.

46
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:57,910
You may rise.

47
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,130
Come on. Get up.

48
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,140
Thank you, General.

49
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,100
Come over. Come.

50
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:03,980
Feng Ying, you may rise, too.

51
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,340
Feng Ying,

52
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,680
let's drink tonight.

53
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,390
I have something to tell you.

54
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,500
Come over. Come.

55
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,300
I'll be waiting in the wing room.

56
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,860
Fieldwork spies got back some delicacies.

57
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,610
The cook doesn't know how to cook them.

58
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,250
I'll go check it out in case they're wasted.

59
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,700
Off you go.

60
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,920
Come on, Miss Liu. This way.

61
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,860
Come in, please.

62
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,780
Be seated.

63
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,570
I don't dare to sit here.

64
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,000
Why?

65
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,180
Just be seated. Come on.

66
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,820
Thank you, General.

67
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,530
Miss Liu, what do you think of this zither?

68
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:58,860
Miss Liu,

69
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,100
if you like it,

70
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,030
why not have a try?

71
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,080
General, this is your treasure.

72
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,970
I don't dare to use it.

73
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,220
So what?

74
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,870
You can use everything

75
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,940
in this villa as you wish.

76
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,340
Last time,

77
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,240
when I heard you play the song,

78
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,490
I had strong feelings.

79
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,040
So,

80
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,810
I wrote a poem

81
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,780
for you.

82
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,200
If you can make it a song,

83
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,940
it'll be popular all over the country.

84
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,300
Green, green,

85
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,159
the grass by the river.

86
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,900
And in thought,

87
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,460
I follow it far, far away.

88
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,410
By hands,

89
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,970
the zither is played.

90
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,320
I miss you

91
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,180
every night.

92
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,780
How many soul mates can we have?

93
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,490
I live

94
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,170
a wandering life.

95
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,920
Luckily, I meet my soul mate.

96
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,790
I become

97
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,580
spirited again.

98
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,150
What a nice poem!

99
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,780
General, with civil and martial virtues,

100
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,500
you're indeed the pillar of our state.

101
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,980
The soul mate in this poem

102
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,450
turns out to be you, Miss Liu.

103
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,390
Miss Liu,

104
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,840
what are you doing?

105
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,330
My parents died when I was little.

106
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,460
I've been living a wandering life.

107
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,590
Luckily, I met you, General.

108
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,400
Hope you'll care about me.

109
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,430
Miss Liu,

110
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,390
I will be with you

111
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,250
till the end

112
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,010
of the line.

113
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,580
Thank you, General.

114
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:39,980
(Xun Xu's House in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

115
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,840
Zhulong's Case

116
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,880
has reverberated throughout the state.

117
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,380
The court is also concerned about it.

118
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:53,850
Yeah.

119
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,250
Gao Tangbing

120
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,100
wouldn't work alone.

121
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:01,860
Clerk Feng's oversight of his supervisory duty was pardoned.

122
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,280
Looks like the court doesn't want too many people to be involved.

123
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,900
This isn't our concern.

124
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,170
As far as I see,

125
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,640
this case must be completely revealed.

126
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,420
Otherwise, I wouldn't live up

127
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,730
to my job in the Internal Affairs Department.

128
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,130
But Xun Xu,

129
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,510
I'm worried

130
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,260
when the case is revealed

131
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,540
you can't imagine

132
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,730
how much pressure you're going to bear.

133
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,390
I think after you became the Chief Clerk,

134
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,140
you started to care about your post.

135
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,850
We're buddies.

136
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:43,690
I'm caring about it for your sake.

137
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:44,980
Think about it.

138
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,430
Gao Tangbing

139
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,210
worked in the Intelligence Analysis Department for seven or eight years.

140
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,650
He knew

141
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,760
a big bunch of people.

142
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,500
I believe the superiors

143
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,140
don't want you to expose the case too much.

144
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:58,940
I'm no longer young.

145
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,180
All I want is to follow my conscience.

146
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,170
How old are you?

147
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,300
No longer young?

148
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,340
I've got a kind of feeling.

149
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,720
If I can find out the truth of Zhulong's Case,

150
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,140
my life will be worthwhile.

151
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,540
What's wrong with you?

152
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,080
Why do you keep saying that?

153
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,460
You still have a long way to go.

154
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,140
Clerk Chen, Chief Xun,

155
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,950
something happened.

156
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,910
What happened?

157
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,190
Gao Tangbing killed himself.

158
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,270
Cheers, General.

159
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,360
I sent Miss Liu

160
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,700
to pack her things.

161
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,240
In a couple of days,

162
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,750
let her move in.

163
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,340
Ziyan House lies in a disreputable place.

164
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,820
Miss Liu shouldn't always live there.

165
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,940
Feng Ying,

166
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,020
these are only trifles.

167
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,500
I'll have you take care of them.

168
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,140
Rest assured.

169
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,040
I will have everything arranged perfectly.

170
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,420
Only in this way can I feel relieved.

171
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,120
Feng Ying,

172
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,810
I only did a little favor

173
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,470
to help you out of trouble.

174
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,290
General, you think it's a little favor.

175
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:26,970
But in my heart,

176
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,020
you saved my life.

177
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,830
I'm a clumsy man.

178
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,870
But I never hesitate about repaying you.

179
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,460
Get up. Get up.

180
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:39,060
I have a selfish motive

181
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,330
to keep you in Siwencao Intelligence.

182
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,100
I'm all ears, General.

183
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,260
Come over.

184
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,340
At the morning court in Chengdu,

185
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,100
Zhuge Liang and I

186
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,660
got incompatible.

187
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,250
We will break with each other sooner or later.

188
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,050
Rest assured, General.

189
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,280
Now that I'm on your side,

190
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,400
I owe my life to you.

191
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,620
No matter how dangerous my mission is,

192
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,760
I will not decline it.

193
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,500
His Majesty gave me a secret edict.

194
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,520
Now that you have it,

195
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,700
what are you scared of?

196
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,340
I have a secret edict.

197
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,740
But Zhuge Liang has great power in the court

198
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,500
and he can't be underestimated.

199
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:33,060
That's right.

200
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,740
Speaking of that,

201
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,100
except for local clans,

202
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,650
most civil and military officials

203
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,950
were instructed by the Prime Minister.

204
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,080
So,

205
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,210
we mustn't leave any trace!

206
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,510
We have to prove his crime of deceiving His Majesty

207
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,970
and let no one realize that it's our trap.

208
00:11:58,930 --> 00:11:59,760
Got it, General.

209
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,540
When I have a detailed plan,

210
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,140
I'll let you know.

211
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,880
Feng Ying,

212
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,940
I count on you

213
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:15,300
for the fate of our state.

214
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,190
I won't let you down, General.

215
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,060
After dinner last night,

216
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,190
no one came.

217
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,940
They didn't find out that Gao Tangbing died

218
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,450
until they patrolled at eleven.

219
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,420
Impossible.

220
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,250
This is impossible.

221
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,130
A wood chip from the table leg killed him.

222
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,060
The wood chip

223
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,660
penetrated his neck.

224
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,700
According to the preliminary judgment,

225
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,050
he killed himself.

226
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,790
Xun Xu,

227
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,680
don't lose heart.

228
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,280
Actually,

229
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,740
it may be a good thing.

230
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,660
I'm serious.

231
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,770
This is a great thing.

232
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,080
When Xun Xu keeps investigating the case,

233
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,100
everybody is gossiping fiercely.

234
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,630
About what?

235
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,330
They say Xun Xu wants

236
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,550
to investigate all seniors like us

237
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:11,760
for his own self-interest.

238
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,200
To catch Zhulong,

239
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,270
Chief Xun paid a big price.

240
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,120
Stop gossiping about him.

241
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:25,840
Yes.

242
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,540
You're right, Clerk Feng.

243
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,480
So,

244
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,140
I stopped them

245
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,020
from gossiping immediately.

246
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:31,740
I told them

247
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,490
that they should give priority to

248
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,140
the work of the Internal Affairs Department.

249
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,340
Feng Ying,

250
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,590
they have a reason to gossip.

251
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,020
Xun Xu keeps picking on Gao Tangbing.

252
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,490
He must be up to something.

253
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,410
Xun Xu is

254
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,380
paralyzed from the waist down

255
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,740
so that he's like a changed man.

256
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,830
Feng Ying, he hates you.

257
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,980
Don't talk nonsense!

258
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,060
It's not nonsense. It's the truth.

259
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,730
Stop.

260
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,860
Don't talk nonsense when you're at work.

261
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,830
I'll have a word with Xun Xu.

262
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,060
Aye.

263
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,330
Gao Tangbing is dead.

264
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:15,900
Zhulong's Case can finally be closed.

265
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:18,560
Chen Gong,

266
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,460
a lot of people are involved in this case.

267
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,420
It's not that simple.

268
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,820
I'm certainly aware of that.

269
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,040
But closing the case as a suicide

270
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,740
will be advantageous to you.

271
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,220
Do as I tell you.

272
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,060
Gao Tangbing wouldn't kill himself.

273
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,880
We had him checked several times.

274
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,690
The angle, strength of the wood chip,

275
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,060
and even the spraying direction of blood all coincided.

276
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,860
He killed himself, I guess.

277
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:08,000
I know him very well.

278
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,250
He isn't that kind of man who would kill himself.

279
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,000
The wood chip was taken from the table leg.

280
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,470
But his hand was clean.

281
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,820
It wasn't even scratched.

282
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,260
So, it wasn't him

283
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,980
who took the wood chip off the table leg.

284
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,680
If so,

285
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,230
the murderer must have made a noise.

286
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,290
Why did Gao Tangbing do nothing to save himself?

287
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,760
It doesn't make any sense, either.

288
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:31,630
The sleeping powder...

289
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:37,450
Chief Xun.

290
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:38,570
What's up?

291
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,150
Clerk Feng asked to see you.

292
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:52,580
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

293
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,740
Here comes General Guo!
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

294
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,500
Here comes General Guo!

295
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:10,720
(Guo Huai, General of Prestige)

296
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,180
Uncle, there you are.

297
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,660
Something big will happen in West Shu.

298
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:42,690
I must come personally.

299
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,540
Let me introduce a friend to you.

300
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:51,380
I'm Huang Yu, the leader of Wuxian Sect.

301
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,240
Greetings, Governor Guo.

302
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,560
Leader Huang,

303
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:55,630
I've heard a lot about you.

304
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,580
All right. Let's get in first.

305
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,450
Has Chen Gong

306
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,570
risen to power over Siwencao Intelligence?

307
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,930
Until one last move.

308
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,040
Leader Huang,

309
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,200
tell Governor Guo

310
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,550
what happened to your sect.

311
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,130
Our sect prevailed in the Hanzhong region for over thirty years.

312
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,500
But it was overthrown overnight.

313
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,150
Even though I was ashamed,

314
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,140
I came alone for shelter,

315
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,980
because I heard that all talents were welcome to the Wei State

316
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,740
and I could be protected here.

317
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,020
My point is

318
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,220
that Chen Gong

319
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,580
works for us.

320
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,430
If Chen Gong hadn't disguised himself as Mi Chong

321
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,210
and used a lot of schemes,

322
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,460
my sect wouldn't

323
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,420
have been destroyed like this.

324
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,100
Inspector Guo Huai,

325
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,140
I'm not saying this for selfish motives.

326
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,700
But Chen Gong is born

327
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,340
to be a sinful man.

328
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,470
He's in no way dependable.

329
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,140
All right.

330
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,260
I know you have lost a lot.

331
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:57,570
I've reported it to the court.

332
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:01,060
Don't worry. You'll get a high reward.

333
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,630
Thank you.

334
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:07,090
Inspector Guo, Governor Guo,

335
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:08,810
thank you for your patronage.

336
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,910
Then let go

337
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,920
of Chen Gong.

338
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,930
He did everything under my command.

339
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,240
His Majesty asked me to console you.

340
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,860
Wuxian Sect

341
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,310
has made a great contribution.

342
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,560
When our state unifies the whole country,

343
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,650
Wuxian Sect may even be

344
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:29,620
the state religion,

345
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,700
considering your credits.

346
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,900
His Majesty reigns over the state.

347
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:39,970
He will unify the country.

348
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,040
I will

349
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,040
follow his order.

350
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,600
Be seated.

351
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,400
After you return to the Hanzhong region,

352
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,840
you have to cooperate with Chen Gong.

353
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,150
I know

354
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:01,200
you hate him.

355
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:04,300
But overall interests come first.

356
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,280
Our state will annex the other two states and unify the country.

357
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,010
This is a magnificent thing.

358
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,710
Sacrifices in any form

359
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,830
will be necessary.

360
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,780
You saved my life.

361
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,640
I'll keep in mind

362
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,010
whatever you tell me.

363
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,440
Good.

364
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:30,720
General Li Yan isn't in.

365
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,640
(Li Yan's Villa in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)
General Li Yan isn't in.

366
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:31,960
(Li Yan's Villa in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

367
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,870
Please wait for him in his study.
(Li Yan's Villa in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

368
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:34,340
(Li Yan's Villa in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

369
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,020
This way, please.

370
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,260
Miss Liu.

371
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,420
Long time no see,

372
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,340
Clerk Chen.

373
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:17,930
Leave it to me.

374
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,860
No one else is around.

375
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,210
We can talk about business.

376
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,230
Gao Tangbing is dead.

377
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,070
You're completely safe.

378
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:40,520
Unfortunately,

379
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,300
Xun Xu

380
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,570
will stick to the case.

381
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,360
What do I need to do?

382
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:50,770
Just wait and see.

383
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,100
How's everything going with you?

384
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,500
General Li Yan has a crush on me.

385
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,800
He even wrote a poem for me.

386
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,500
Green, green, the grass by the river.

387
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,950
And in thought, I follow it far, far away.

388
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,460
By hands, the zither is played.

389
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:10,310
I miss you every night.

390
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:11,840
This is his handwriting.

391
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,160
How romantic!

392
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:17,820
I'll keep it.

393
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:21,170
We can use it to control and threaten him.

394
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,420
What happened to Gao Tangbing?

395
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,490
Chen Gong asked me to close the case as a suicide.

396
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,570
So,

397
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,150
it wasn't a suicide?

398
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,250
It wasn't, as I judged personally.

399
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,120
Any evidence?

400
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,060
It was by my intuition.

401
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:53,490
No solid evidence?

402
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,410
Not yet.

403
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,930
I just feel something's wrong.

404
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,220
Clerk Feng,

405
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,140
is there anything wrong?

406
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,160
I'm afraid Chen Gong made the right decision.

407
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,560
The fight for power

408
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,530
has never stopped.

409
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,720
Prime Minister Zhuge will start the second Northern Expedition.

410
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,080
Our agency must be stable.

411
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:24,850
This is the big picture.

412
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,880
But cases are cases.

413
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,640
If a case is laid aside,

414
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,730
I'm afraid it'll lead to big trouble.

415
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,690
Slight negligence

416
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,370
may lead to great disaster.

417
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,980
Do you think I'm not aware of that?

418
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,820
Gao Tangbing is a typical example.

419
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:51,250
But have you

420
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:52,250
thought about it?

421
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,360
Gao Tangbing

422
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,260
worked in Siwencao Intelligence

423
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,400
for a longer time than you.

424
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,250
More than 80 percent of our men

425
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,540
got along well with him.

426
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,130
And nearly all of them

427
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,910
didn't know that he was a traitor

428
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:13,320
just like you.

429
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,190
Because of Zhulong's Case,

430
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,360
so many people have been jittery.

431
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,150
Under such circumstances,

432
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,170
our intelligence work against the Wei State can't be done.

433
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,020
Even the basic collecting work

434
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,210
has been held up.

435
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:38,150
The Prime Minister submitted a military pledge for the Northern Expedition.

436
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,230
Once he fails again,

437
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,770
there'll be consequences.

438
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:52,250
I know what a man you are.

439
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:55,860
It's impossible

440
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,680
to have you stop now.

441
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:01,840
I'm grateful

442
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,440
that you can understand me.

443
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,720
Fine.

444
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,150
You can do what you want.

445
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,750
But I have a request.

446
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,350
Don't say that.

447
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,430
Feel free to tell me to do anything.

448
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:25,640
As for Gao Tangbing's death,

449
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,090
close the case as a suicide,

450
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:29,990
just like Chen Gong suggested.

451
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,450
To reassure everyone in our agency,

452
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:33,820
your investigation

453
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,050
must be carried out in secret

454
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,930
instead of disturbing our daily work.

455
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,490
But Clerk Feng, how can I...

456
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:41,490
This is the bottom line.

457
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:43,940
At a critical moment,

458
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,130
no case

459
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,580
shall bring trouble to our work.

460
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,590
Within these days,

461
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,100
we must overthrow Feng Ying.

462
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,710
Gao Tangbing's death

463
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,490
isn't big enough to convict Feng Ying, right?

464
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,920
So, we must set a trap for him.

465
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:14,040
I've been waiting for this day for three years.

466
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,620
We mustn't let him be on guard.

467
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:18,770
Miss Liu,

468
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,010
did Inspector Guo

469
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,750
tell you Feng Ying's emergency contact channel?

470
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,100
Mount Chiyan

471
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:30,340
at Qingshi Valley.

472
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:31,280
Okay.

473
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,440
General Li Yan is back.

474
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,680
Clerk Chen, please wait a minute.

475
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,330
I'll take my leave.

476
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,250
Sun Ling.

477
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,110
Feng Ying,

478
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,520
Chief Yang came.

479
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,260
Where is he?

480
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,600
In your study.

481
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,340
Keep watch at the door.

482
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,400
Got it, Feng Ying.

483
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,090
Chief Yang.

484
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:22,660
Feng Ying, there you are.

485
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:24,840
I knew you would come.

486
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,570
The Prime Minister no longer grounds me.

487
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,160
The second Northern Expedition

488
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,390
will start momentarily.

489
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,000
I know.

490
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,040
Later,

491
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,250
I'll go report something

492
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,090
to General Li Yan.

493
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:38,470
I won't hold you up.

494
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,940
I'm going back to Chengdu this noon.

495
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,340
In such a hurry?

496
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,240
I made a special trip to you.

497
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:46,920
Feng Ying,

498
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,300
we've been preparing this trap for years

499
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,990
and it's time to put an end to it.

500
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:58,280
Oh, Chen Gong.

501
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:01,650
You've already come?

502
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,050
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

503
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,630
You may rise, come on.

504
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,770
Be seated.

505
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,990
Come on. Be seated.

506
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,400
Sir,

507
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,790
I just heard Miss Liu Ying

508
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,970
play a song.

509
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:23,930
That was beautiful.

510
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,580
Good for you.

511
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:28,250
What a surprise!

512
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,670
A swordsman like you

513
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,660
can also understand the meaning in the music.

514
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,840
You flatter me.

515
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,880
Sir, I wonder

516
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:38,980
what you want me for.

517
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:40,650
Music is

518
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:43,040
just like the human minds

519
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:44,850
people in Siwencao Intelligence like to think about.

520
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,120
The more you think about it,

521
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,300
the more complicated

522
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,780
you find it.

523
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,830
You have such good taste

524
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:54,320
that others can't compare.

525
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:56,240
Don't leave this noon.

526
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,690
Stay for lunch.

527
00:28:58,970 --> 00:28:59,860
Feng Ying will come, too.

528
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,290
I have something to tell you.

529
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,060
After Jieting's false intelligence case,

530
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:05,550
(Feng Ying's House in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)
After Jieting's false intelligence case,

531
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,580
(Feng Ying's House in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

532
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,260
Guo Huai activated Qingping Plan.
(Feng Ying's House in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

533
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,240
(Feng Ying's House in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

534
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,600
Something like stealing the crossbows is mere camouflage.

535
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:16,470
The plan aims to control our senior commanders,

536
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,130
especially General Li Yan.

537
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,290
We make use of their plan

538
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,680
and let them complete their plans.

539
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,400
Even I become

540
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,260
Li Yan's henchman.

541
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:31,110
When you sold me out,

542
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,660
I realized

543
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:35,360
that everything was going as you scheduled.

544
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,680
But I'm hesitating, too.

545
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,610
The Prime Minister is ignorant of our plan.

546
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:49,990
The interlocked stratagems

547
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,810
will get a lot of people involved.

548
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,470
This plan is very extreme

549
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,180
and must be kept secret.

550
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,940
Once it's exposed,

551
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:01,350
Li Yan will not let us get away.

552
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,780
I'm afraid we will die an ignominious death.

553
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,110
The Prime Minister

554
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:10,400
will also be implicated.

555
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,180
And everyone in Siwencao Intelligence...

556
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,390
We will fail to explain to them.

557
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,360
I get your point.

558
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:25,130
But now, we have to take the risk.

559
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,490
This is our only chance

560
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,800
to overthrow Li Yan.

561
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,010
Now that he has taken action,

562
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,160
we must put him in jail.

563
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,460
This is a serious matter.

564
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,680
We have to be determined.

565
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,560
All right, then.

566
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:51,190
Li Yan invited me to lunch.

567
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,390
I will propose a plan.

568
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,590
You must set the trap perfectly.

569
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,750
That's for sure.

570
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,240
If Li Yan dares to activate this plan,

571
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,680
he will be

572
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:07,400
on his way to death.

573
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,600
I'm always reassured about you.

574
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,020
But in this way,

575
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,610
I'm afraid

576
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,350
you can't get away.

577
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:22,720
Even if I die,

578
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,670
the Shu State will last.

579
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:26,620
I'll have no regrets.

580
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,080
Is there anything else

581
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,370
I can help you with?

582
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,080
Yes.

583
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,260
There're two problems in Siwencao Intelligence

584
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,540
that I can hardly handle.

585
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:50,260
Chen Gong?

586
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:51,050
Right.

587
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,770
Chen Gong hates you

588
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,330
for his father's death ten years ago.

589
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:57,770
I can explain it to him

590
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:59,130
when possible.

591
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:02,710
What is the other problem?

592
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:04,500
Xun Xu.

593
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,270
He's sticking to the case,

594
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,260
much faster than my schedule.

595
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,670
He doesn't let go of Gao Tangbing's death.

596
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,660
Soon, he'll track down on me.

597
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:18,530
I'm afraid I can't hold onto the last minute.

598
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:22,800
Stop the investigation?

599
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,340
Precisely,

600
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,820
I must close the case as a suicide

601
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,440
and investigate it secretly.

602
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,130
Everybody in the Agency is experienced.

603
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:35,170
We'll easily be exposed even if we investigate secretly.

604
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,230
How can we carry on?

605
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:39,890
Tell me again

606
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,550
about what happened

607
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:42,490
when Gao Tangbing died.

608
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:44,740
Last night,

609
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,680
I was on duty.

610
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,250
Come on. Time for the roll call.

611
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,420
When we changed shifts at eleven,

612
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,180
according to the rules,

613
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:54,470
two persons were patrolling.

614
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,040
Time for the roll call.

615
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,290
Chief Gao.

616
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,700
Chief Gao, time for the roll call.

617
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,090
Chief Gao?

618
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,260
Chief Gao.

619
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,270
Chief Gao?

620
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,440
Oh, no.

621
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:41,320
When I reached the cell,

622
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,860
Gao Tangbing died a long time ago.

623
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:46,530
When was dinner sent to him?

624
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,580
It was recorded.

625
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:48,990
At a quarter past five.

626
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,340
He was alive at that time.

627
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,170
Did you ask the deliveryman?

628
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:53,480
Yes.

629
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,710
He said

630
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:57,040
Chief Gao looked a little bit dispirited

631
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,300
and nothing else was unusual.

632
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:05,030
So,

633
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:08,040
whether he killed himself or was killed,

634
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:10,600
it happened between a quarter past five

635
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:11,670
to eleven.

636
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:12,739
Right.

637
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:14,580
Within the five hours.

638
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:15,969
During that period,

639
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,290
no one went in or out of his jail.

640
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,199
Gao Tangbing is a felon.

641
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:23,889
The last door of his jail can't be opened

642
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,940
without two keys.

643
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,989
It was immensely difficult

644
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,929
to sneak into his jail without leaving a trace.

645
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:36,489
Feng Ying,

646
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,139
I'll count on you.

647
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,600
Don't worry, Yang Yi.

648
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:42,460
Farewell.

649
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,940
It's okay. Get to your business.

650
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:56,690
Umm...

651
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:57,550
Feng Ying...

652
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:58,980
What? Stop prevaricating.

653
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,080
I'm afraid Chief Yang's visit

654
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,820
will be disadvantageous to you.

655
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,260
Don't tell anyone

656
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,440
that Chief Yang visited me.

657
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,350
You shall forget it, too.

658
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:15,400
But I'm worried about you.

659
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,910
Think about it.

660
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:19,170
Shortly after you sold him out,

661
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,910
he came to visit you.

662
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,210
He must be up to something.

663
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,120
You don't know

664
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,550
about politics.

665
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,210
Don't try to interfere.

666
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,110
General Li Yan is irreconcilable with Yang Yi.

667
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:35,010
You must be very careful.

668
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:41,470
Mm.

669
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,080
I understand.

670
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,000
Greetings, General.

671
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,680
Clerk Chen.

672
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:00,580
Clerk Feng.

673
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,450
Be seated.

674
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:09,830
Feng Ying,

675
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:11,900
you're late.

676
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,720
There was some urgent work to handle

677
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:16,540
and I was held up.

678
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:18,860
The Northern Expedition is starting soon.

679
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:21,110
I've got a secret edict.

680
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:24,920
I told Feng Ying about the key points.

681
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:27,080
Feng Ying,

682
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:28,680
have you got an idea?

683
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:29,860
Tell us about it.

684
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,870
Chen Gong is the son of my friend.

685
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,290
He's an insider.

686
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:43,590
I know.

687
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,250
I don't mean that.

688
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,510
This room is heavily guarded.

689
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:49,790
It's absolutely safe.

690
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:51,110
Don't worry, Clerk Feng.

691
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:53,360
Mm.

692
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,920
General, you told me

693
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:01,960
that we needed

694
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,930
to complete two missions.

695
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,420
First,

696
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:06,880
the second Northern Expedition

697
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,510
would waste our national strength

698
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,100
and bring harm to our state.

699
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:13,730
His Majesty wants to make the Prime Minister fail secretly.

700
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:14,970
Second,

701
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,040
General shouldn't

702
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,920
get involved in this action.

703
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,890
Otherwise, once we fail,

704
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,270
we will

705
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,920
shoot ourselves in the foot.

706
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:28,430
Feng Ying,

707
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,730
good points.

708
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:34,740
It's quite a difficult mission.

709
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,440
Clerk Feng,

710
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,610
do you have any good ideas?

711
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,630
Now that it's a mission for me,

712
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,640
I have to try it, however difficult it is.

713
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,880
Feng Ying, are you saying

714
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,860
that you've already got a good idea?

715
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:49,330
I have

716
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,060
interlocked stratagems.

717
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:53,400
Three steps are needed.

718
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,880
Let's drink

719
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:03,210
before Feng Ying explains it.

720
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,560
There are three steps.

721
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:17,030
But the point is simple.

722
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,070
Making use of someone else.

723
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:23,380
I'm all ears.

724
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:26,580
For the Northern Expedition,

725
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:29,620
the Prime Minister will imitate Han Xin's trick

726
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,040
to carry on a secret affair.

727
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:36,010
Wei Yan and his army will fake an attack on Longxi through Mount Qi.

728
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,730
The Prime Minister himself

729
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,910
will attack Chencang County unexpectedly

730
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,730
with the main force.

731
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,210
With Chencang County as the transfer center for army provisions,

732
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,700
they'll approach Chang'an.

733
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,360
So, the first step,

734
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,580
we can disclose this secret

735
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,400
to the Wei Army

736
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:59,540
so that they will wipe out Wei Yan's army.

737
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,520
Even if

738
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,060
Wei Yan's vanguard

739
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,290
can be all killed,

740
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:11,670
it may not harm

741
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,690
the Northern Expedition.

742
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,380
This is only the first step.

743
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,940
It aims

744
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:20,100
to hold up the Prime Minister

745
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:21,320
so that

746
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,050
he can't conquer Chencang County

747
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:25,000
and it will gain time

748
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,300
for our second step.

749
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:33,800
Sir,

750
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,510
there are two difficulties

751
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:39,380
to carry out this plan.

752
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:41,440
Be specific.

753
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:42,620
First,

754
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,670
the Prime Minister's plan

755
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,200
to attack Chencang County secretly

756
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,920
must be a top secret.

757
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:52,060
The transmission of intel is complicated.

758
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,590
What if...

759
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,590
I mean what if the intel is intercepted by our spies?

760
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,610
Once they investigate it,

761
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,430
they will soon track down us.

762
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,350
Sir,

763
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:03,820
then you'll be accused

764
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:05,250
of treason.

765
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:07,920
Second,

766
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,040
the intelligence systems of Shu and Wei

767
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:12,100
can be very complicated.

768
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,190
Some intel is real while some is false.

769
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:14,760
Clerk Feng,

770
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:17,370
how can you guarantee

771
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:19,680
that senior management of Wei

772
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,230
will believe the intel

773
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,210
we tell them?

774
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:33,840
This isn't a problem.

775
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:37,090
I have

776
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:39,650
an intelligence channel

777
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,650
to contact Guo Huai directly.

778
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:42,480
He will believe it.

779
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:44,150
I never expected you

780
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,670
to have such a high-level intelligence channel.

781
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:50,620
Feng Ying,

782
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:54,340
you're awesome!

783
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,020
General,

784
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,130
to restore the Han Dynasty,

785
00:40:58,570 --> 00:40:59,500
our agency

786
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:01,630
has to adopt some extreme measures.

787
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,080
Sir,

788
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:09,700
if Clerk Feng can send this intel

789
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,770
to Guo Huai

790
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,670
straightforwardly,

791
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:12,710
this plan

792
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,370
will be feasible.

793
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:17,260
Second,

794
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,450
we have to count on you, General.

795
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,920
The late emperor ordered you to garrison Jiangzhou for a long time

796
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,030
against the Wu Army.

797
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:30,020
So, Clerk Feng, it's the Wu Army

798
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:30,930
that you want to make use of.

799
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,440
Chen Gong, you're an insider.

800
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,730
You got to understand me so quickly.

801
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,960
In the second step,

802
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:43,410
General, ask your henchmen

803
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:44,660
to disguise themselves as the Wu soldiers,

804
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,570
attack our checkpoints,

805
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,560
and cut off the trade route between Wu and Shu.

806
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,880
Then, let them spread rumors

807
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,640
that the Wu Army will invade us

808
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:55,030
and fake a huge crisis

809
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:57,290
that we have to fight two states at the same time.

810
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,750
However,

811
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:01,260
the Wu State

812
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,360
agreed to fight against the Wei Army

813
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:05,060
together with our prime minister.

814
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:06,750
Emperor Sun Quan of Wu

815
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,110
will go to Wancheng County

816
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,810
with his army.

817
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,390
How will he come to invade us?

818
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:15,350
In war, there's always too much deception.

819
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:23,120
Clerk Feng, are you saying

820
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:24,660
that

821
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,320
the invasion of Wu

822
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,810
doesn't need to be real?

823
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:30,700
When the news gets to Chengdu

824
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:33,160
and the Prime Minister isn't there,

825
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:35,760
His Majesty will order General Li

826
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,000
to negotiate with the Wu Army

827
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:39,630
for final decision.

828
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,030
That's right.

829
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:42,970
His Majesty will do that.

830
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,120
In this way,

831
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,420
I can withdraw

832
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:51,280
the army provisions

833
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,710
in the name of preparing to fight against Wu

834
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:54,570
and have them sent to the frontline against Wu.

835
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:56,210
This is drastic.

836
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,930
But this is treason!

837
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:03,040
It's wise of you, General.

838
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:12,530
(Intelligence Agency in Longxi)
(The 24 Strategies of War, The Wind Blows from Longxi)

839
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,800
(The Eighteenth Strategy Interlocked Stratagems)

840
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:21,420
So,

841
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:23,720
my brother-in-law Feng Ying

842
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,440
always knows the real Qingping Plan.

843
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,020
He just cooperated with Yang Yi

844
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,100
and set a trap for Li Yan by the way.

845
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:34,130
He will overthrow Li Yan with three-step interlocked stratagems.

846
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,040
Most ruthlessly,

847
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:36,820
in the first step,

848
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:39,560
Feng Ying gets himself involved.

849
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,350
I guess it's because

850
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:42,980
he still appears to work for Li Yan.

851
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:44,440
He can't make Li Yan trust him

852
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:46,260
unless he sacrifices first.

853
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:48,000
Next,

854
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:52,180
Li Yan will fake the truth that the Wu Army will invade us.

855
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:56,000
Then the third step can be carried out logically.

856
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:00,060
Li Yan will withdraw the army provisions from the frontline against Wei

857
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:01,390
to the frontline against Wu.

858
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,980
This plan sounds perfect!

859
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:08,740
Feng Ying proposed this plan after giving Li Yan a house.

860
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:11,970
Chen Gong agreed with the plan as the son of Li Yan's old friend.

861
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,040
Li Yan would easily be interested.

862
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,920
I wonder if Feng Ying's interlocked stratagems

863
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,000
could finally work.

864
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,410
How will Li Yan end up?

865
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,850
And how will Feng Ying end up?

866
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:27,520
Xun Xu secretly investigates Gao Tangbing's case.

867
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,500
Will his investigation go smoothly?

868
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,840
I'm indeed worried.

869
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,330
I'll say no more.

870
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:35,100
Let me go get more information.

871
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,330
Wait for me.
