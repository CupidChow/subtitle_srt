(Wei's Central Camp in Tianshui, the Wei State)

4
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,229
General,

5
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,750
a secret messenger sent by Leader Huang Yu has arrived.

6
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,420
Get him in.

7
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:51,950
Yes, sir.

8
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,340
Greetings, Inspector Guo, Governor Guo.

9
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,250
No need of civility.

10
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,540
Any messages from Leader Huang?

11
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,400
He asked you to rest assured

12
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,170
and said everything is under your control.

13
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:06,650
Good.

14
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:07,730
You must be exhausted.

15
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,729
Go get some rest.

16
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:10,770
Thank you, sir.

17
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:24,970
Chen Gong

18
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,990
didn't let me down.

19
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,130
Marvelous.

20
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,810
Under the disguise as the invasion of the Wu Army,

21
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,400
Li Yan had the army provisions sent to Jiangzhou.

22
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,900
Then Zhuge Liang will only receive the first batch of army provisions.

23
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,200
They are enough

24
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,920
for his army for just one month.

25
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:45,680
His backup will be cut.

26
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,570
Zhulong is

27
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,010
doing a good job.

28
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,160
When Huang Yu takes action in the north of Sanguan Pass,

29
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,550
Zhuge Liang may not even receive

30
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,780
this batch of army provisions.

31
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,400
Now, Chen Gong holds immense power

32
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,640
in Siwencao Intelligence.

33
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,690
Li Yan succumbs to us, too.

34
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,680
Qingping Plan is

35
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,610
going more smoothly than we imagined.

36
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,140
Even so, we still mustn't be careless.

37
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,050
Got it.

38
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,100
Come.

39
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,140
Send a report to Hao Zhao immediately,

40
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,100
ask him to defend Chencang County for a month.

41
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,620
Within a month,

42
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,720
if he loses the county,

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,040
he'll die.

44
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,440
If he holds it for over a month,

45
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,860
I'll undertake all the responsibility.

46
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:30,480
Yes, sir.

47
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,290
(Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

48
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,760

(Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

49
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,220
(Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

50
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,880
I was thinking of everything about Chen Gong.

51
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,290
It's really weird.

52
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,210
Chief Xun,

53
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,290
Huang Yu was detected at the checkpoint of Xixiang.

54
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:48,610
Are you sure?

55
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,520
Yes.

56
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,940
The commandant at the checkpoint saw Huang Yu.

57
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,600
Huang Yu attacks the checkpoint of Xixiang at this time.

58
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:55,810
What is he up to?

59
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,170
After he destroyed the checkpoint,

60
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,870
he led his men to Xixiang.

61
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,730
Did you report it to Clerk Chen?

62
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,490
After Clerk Chen was informed,

63
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,400
he headed for Xixiang immediately.

64
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,890
Alright. I got it.

65
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:10,860
Go.

66
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:33,080
(Within the checkpoint of Xixiang, the Shu State)

67
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,280
Clerk Chen, at last.
(Within the checkpoint of Xixiang, the Shu State)

68
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,830
Clerk Chen, at last.

69
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,730
I thought you wouldn't come.

70
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:38,720
What?

71
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:40,760
General Guo Huai

72
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,010
still doesn't trust me?

73
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:46,770
Shoot Xun Xu

74
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,210
with this poisonous arrow

75
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,330
and he will not live.

76
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:54,990
No problem.

77
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:56,770
I'll make my bones.

78
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,170
Don't worry, Clerk Chen.

79
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,590
When Xun Xu is killed here,

80
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,850
you can shift the blame on my sect.

81
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,250
There he is.

82
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,030
Clerk Chen, it's your showtime.

83
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,940
Clerk Chen is your sworn brother.

84
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,640
And he loves Di Yue.

85
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:43,409
His feelings are true.

86
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:44,490
What makes you think he's fishy?

87
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:47,800
I don't know.

88
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:49,930
I just feel

89
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,960
that I can hardly understand Chen Gong.

90
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,050
Under such circumstances,

91
00:05:58,930 --> 00:05:59,800
don't give it another thought.

92
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,560
Make your decision.

93
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,330
Enemy attack!

94
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:15,490
Chief Xun!

95
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,610
Chief Xun!

96
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,130
Good shot, Chen Gong.

97
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,090
Kill!

98
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,620
All of them!

99
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:34,450
Kill!

100
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:36,850
Go! Hurry!

101
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,640
Hurry!

102
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,090
Gee!

103
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:49,409
Gee!

104
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:53,080
Gee!

105
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:35,130
Chief Xun.

106
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,410
It's time that I sacrifice for our state.

107
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,090
I'm not able to bury you properly.

108
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,200
Chief Xun,

109
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,090
I'll hide you here

110
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,730
to avoid humiliation by the enemy.

111
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,900
(Siwencao Intelligence in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

112
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,340
We kept searching the place
(Siwencao Intelligence in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

113
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:16,370
(Siwencao Intelligence in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

114
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:17,890
that Pei Xu indicated,
(Siwencao Intelligence in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

115
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,480
but we didn't find Xun Xu.

116
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:27,610
Clerk Chen.

117
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:31,840
Did Pei Xu say

118
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,050
why Xun Xu went to the suburb of Xixiang?

119
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,600
He said they were informed

120
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,400
that Huang Yu was detected

121
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:39,890
in the suburb of Xixiang.

122
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:43,410
Then Xun Xu thought Huang Yu's sudden appearance

123
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,530
may have something to do with Gao Tangbing's death

124
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,360
and Clerk Feng's arrest.

125
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,850
So, he hurried there

126
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,680
to investigate.

127
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,680
I was informed of that, too.

128
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,130
Then I went there before Xun Xu.

129
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:57,780
During the Northern Expedition,

130
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,900
we've got a lot of work to do.

131
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,340
But the Internal Affairs Department wasn't asked to investigate the case.

132
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:05,560
Why did Xun Xu

133
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,460
go there

134
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,450
without reporting it first?

135
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,800
I asked Pei Xu about it.

136
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,330
He said he wasn't sure.

137
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,480
After all, he couldn't ask too much

138
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,970
about Xun Xu's thoughts.

139
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:20,890
How is Pei Xu now?

140
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,060
He's badly wounded.

141
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:22,930
But,

142
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,370
he will survive.

143
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,540
A lot of accidents have happened lately.

144
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,360
Chief Yin,

145
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,690
what do you think?

146
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,440
It doesn't matter

147
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:39,810
what I think.

148
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,590
Now, I'm quite exhausted.

149
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,320
Chief Yin,

150
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,250
please speak without reserve.

151
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,680
It's said

152
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,900
that Clerk Feng is a Wei spy.

153
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,820
But I don't believe it.

154
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,480
Is there any evidence?

155
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:02,920
Siwencao Intelligence

156
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,120
was founded by Clerk Feng.

157
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,090
Never would he

158
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,210
do anything to hurt our agency.

159
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,770
What about Xun Xu?

160
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,250
Xun Xu went to the suburb of Xixiang without a reason.

161
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,230
What do you

162
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,610
think of that?

163
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,250
As far as I see,

164
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,020
Xun Xu hurried to Xixiang not only

165
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:27,580
because Huang Yu appeared there.

166
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,610
There must be another reason.

167
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,090
Chief Yin, sounds like you know Xun Xu very well.

168
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,210
Although we may not agree on some things

169
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,050
that Xun Xu usually does.

170
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:42,890
But I think

171
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,130
his talent and wisdom

172
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,370
are fine.

173
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,430
By the way,

174
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,330
when I talked to Pei Xu,

175
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,250
I felt that he was keeping something

176
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,050
from me.

177
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,230
Alright.

178
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:02,850
I got it.

179
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,010
Thank you, Chief Yin.

180
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,130
Let's call it a day.

181
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,240
If you want anything, let me know.

182
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,280
Thank you.

183
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,200
(Li Yan's Mansion in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

184
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,810
Have I made myself clear?
(Li Yan's Mansion in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

185
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:21,900
Yes.

186
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:22,850
Leave.

187
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,720
Yes, sir.

188
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,690
The Prime Minister fails to take Chencang County after a long while.

189
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,610
His troops are struck along Chencang Road.

190
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,970
General, I'm afraid before you take action,

191
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:43,890
he may order a retreat

192
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,030
within ten days.

193
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,480
You're underestimating him.

194
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,770
Prime Minister Zhuge

195
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,890
has never easily given in

196
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,570
since he followed the late emperor

197
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,410
in Nanyang.

198
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,280
The Wei Army has famous generals

199
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,560
including Sima Yi, Cao Zhen, and Guo Huai.

200
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,010
It's by no means easy for the Prime Minister

201
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,290
to conquer Chang'an.

202
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,070
Zhuge Liang

203
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:16,250
doesn't want to conquer Chang'an.

204
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,360
As long as

205
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,800
he takes down Tianshui

206
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,250
or Shanggui in Longxi,

207
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,850
the morale of his troops will be greatly boosted.

208
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,610
Once the news of victory is sent back to Chengdu,

209
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,280
some officials will offer advice to His Majesty.

210
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,690
His Majesty is never decisive.

211
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,330
Then will he still trust me

212
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,130
like he did before?

213
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,490
Unfortunately,

214
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,010
His Majesty has no ambition to conquer the whole country.

215
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,970
He isn't as ambitious as his father at all.

216
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,050
How dare you!

217
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,480
However,

218
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,930
every coin has two sides.

219
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,020
What you just said

220
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,360
can also be a way of self-protection.

221
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,060
We mustn't pin our hopes

222
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,670
on uncertain factors.

223
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,010
Opportunities are transient.

224
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:13,360
We mustn't miss them.

225
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,250
General,

226
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:17,290
Clerk Chen of Siwencao Intelligence asked to see you.

227
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,320
Bring him to the courtyard.

228
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:18,980
Yes, sir.

229
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,250
Hu Zhong,

230
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:24,960
there can be no delay.

231
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,570
Return to Mount Dingjun

232
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,010
and wait for my orders.

233
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,080
Yes, General.

234
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:31,370
Off you go.

235
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:34,890
Take care, General.

236
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,110
Master.

237
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,100
How's everything going in Siwencao Intelligence?

238
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:46,610
Everything is ready.

239
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,570
A communication channel has been built with the Wei Army.

240
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,170
Guo Huai will send a disguised elite army

241
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,770
to await orders outside Sanguan Pass.

242
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,350
Good job. In such a short time,

243
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,270
you have taken the place of Feng Ying.

244
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,220
It was really a hard job.

245
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,530
Your decision concerns the fate of our state.

246
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:02,900
I don't dare to be negligent.

247
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,320
Feng Ying was arrested,

248
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,400
which disappointed me a lot.

249
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,800
I didn't expect him

250
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,620
to easily fail like that

251
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,170
with his lifelong experience in spy games.

252
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,220
The Internal Affairs Department

253
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,450
was investigating the case secretly.

254
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,730
Even I wasn't aware of that.

255
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,110
Xun Xu is a talent.

256
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,840
Unfortunately, he didn't work for me.

257
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:33,930
He died.

258
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,840
You killed him, right?

259
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:42,490
Master,

260
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,820
Xun Xu was sticking to Zhulong's Case.

261
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,690
Gao Tangbing's death made him suspicious.

262
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:51,820
We didn't have the right to arrest Clerk Feng, either.

263
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,490
I was worried that if he continued the investigation,

264
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,970
he would ruin your big plan.

265
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:56,610
So...

266
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,330
So, I had no choice,

267
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,500
but to kill him.

268
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:04,790
Xun Xu

269
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,220
was like a brother to you.

270
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,130
It must have been hard for you to make such a decision

271
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,050
for me.

272
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:20,520
Chen Gong,

273
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,810
if you want to make a big difference,

274
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,250
you have to do something extraordinary.

275
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,010
In a man's life,

276
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,080
the biggest problems are love

277
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,340
and loyalty.

278
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,210
If he can't overcome them,

279
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,500
he will not succeed.

280
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,070
I'll keep it in mind.

281
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,390
I asked Hu Zhong

282
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,770
to return to Mount Dingjun.

283
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:58,080
How is the preparation going in Sanguan Pass?

284
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,410
I need ten days.

285
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,940
Alright. In ten days,

286
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:03,690
I'll ask Ma Dai and Hu Zhong

287
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,920
to deliver the first batch of army provisions to Prime Minister.

288
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:07,920
Rest assured, Master.

289
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,130
This batch of army provisions

290
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:12,130
will not reach Prime Minister.

291
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:12,859
Good.

292
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,540
Once we take action in Jiangzhou,

293
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,430
it'll be a case of kill or cure.

294
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,839
There can be no turning back.

295
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,920
Once the invasion of the Wu Army gets about,

296
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,500
Prime Minister Zhuge will be confronting the troops of two states.

297
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:23,700
He can't handle two battlefields.

298
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,900
By then, you can make a public appeal

299
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,010
and clear up the mess of the two states.

300
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:29,490
Even if Prime Minister

301
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,930
has many adherents in court,

302
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,850
they can't conceal your magnificent contributions.

303
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,320
This is the plan.

304
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,810
But it depends on how you carry it out.

305
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:44,760
Master,

306
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,990
I'll do my best,

307
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:48,530
regardless of my life.

308
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:53,830
Good.

309
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,350
Who are you?

310
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,760
Why do you keep me here?

311
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:29,770
Who are you?

312
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,760
Why do you keep me here?

313
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,740
Come back!

314
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:42,290
How is Xun Xu?

315
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,410
He's energetic.

316
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,870
And he's recovering very well.

317
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,330
Put this in his water every day.

318
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,090
I'm doing it.

319
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,250
According to the physician's prescription,

320
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,030
his wound will recover soon.

321
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,580
Don't

322
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,050
let anyone else know it.

323
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,370
When our big plan is over,

324
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,930
I may not get away unscathed.

325
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,370
Xun Xu has to live behind a fake identity.

326
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:18,130
I will

327
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:20,730
count on you.

328
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,790
I guess there's some room to maneuver.

329
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,300
Let's talk it over

330
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,050
and see if there's another option.

331
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,330
The country is big.

332
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:34,890
But where can he go?

333
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,480
Xun Xu is too stubborn.

334
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,620
Once he comes out,

335
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,430
he won't stop

336
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,170
until he scrutinizes the case.

337
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,150
Just do your best.

338
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:46,850
Take good care of him.

339
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,270
Chief Yang has been trying so hard

340
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,100
to defend Prime Minister.

341
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,760
Once Xun Xu comes out,

342
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:05,210
he will keep investigating the case.

343
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,130
When the truth is known to all,

344
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,840
no one can get away.

345
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,980
Under such circumstances,

346
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:12,840
there isn't a perfect solution.

347
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:15,240
Why don't we

348
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,290
let Xun Xu die

349
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,070
to avoid future troubles?

350
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:22,130
Lin Liang.

351
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,490
I'm exhausted

352
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,610
not only for my wife.

353
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:35,970
By now,

354
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:39,810
I suddenly can't judge

355
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,650
who is right.

356
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,220
Guo Huai, Feng Ying,

357
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,540
Li Yan, and Yang Yi

358
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,820
all appeared in my mind.

359
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:51,930
They said something to me

360
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,060
and gave me missions.

361
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,850
Suddenly, I couldn't connect such things.

362
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:03,430
I'm confused.

363
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,480
I'm tired, too.

364
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,460
But there's one thing

365
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,520
that I'm absolutely clear about.

366
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:19,060
Xun Xu must live.

367
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,550
I don't care whether he is right

368
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,090
or wrong.

369
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:29,970
He must

370
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,650
survive.

371
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:37,850
He's different from other people.

372
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:40,290
In this world, there are few men

373
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,800
like him.

374
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:49,800
You must protect him

375
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,510
with your life

376
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:53,600
as you do to me.

377
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:32,310
Hurry!

378
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:32,830
(Chencang Road)
Hurry!

379
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,760
(Chencang Road)

380
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,090
Hurry!
(Chencang Road)

381
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:37,200
Be quick!
(Chencang Road)

382
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:37,220
(Chencang Road)

383
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:37,720
Quickly! Quickly!
(Chencang Road)

384
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,430
Quickly! Quickly!

385
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,090
Hurry!

386
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,190
Hurry up!

387
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:41,720
Hurry! Fall back!

388
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,210
Fall back!

389
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,010
General Wang!

390
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,090
General Wang, stop!

391
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:52,930
The road ahead of us is quite narrow.

392
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,410
We must watch out for the ambush of the Shu Army.

393
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:54,620
(Wang Shuang, General of Prowess of Wei)
We must watch out for the ambush of the Shu Army.

394
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:54,920
(Wang Shuang, General of Prowess of Wei)

395
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,110
They were defeated more than ten times.
(Wang Shuang, General of Prowess of Wei)

396
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:56,130
(Wang Shuang, General of Prowess of Wei)

397
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,090
They have no way out now.
(Wang Shuang, General of Prowess of Wei)

398
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,960
What are we waiting for?

399
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:00,850
Zhuge Liang is good at stratagems.

400
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,210
If their defeats are simply a trick,

401
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,000
won't you be charging toward their trap?

402
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:09,930
Prime Minister,

403
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:11,490
the exit of the canyon is clogged.

404
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,560
General Liao Hua has returned.

405
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,190
Turn around.

406
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:31,490
Fall back!

407
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,780
Report!

408
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:35,890
General,

409
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,680
the exit of the canyon is clogged by huge logs.

410
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,670
Horses can't pass.

411
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:40,690
We're trapped.

412
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,040
Everybody, get off the horse and walk over the mountain.

413
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:49,960
Prime Minister,

414
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,050
the time has come to act.

415
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:01,330
Go, General Wang Ping.

416
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,830
Shoot!

417
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:11,180
Oh, no!

418
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:03,280
Deng Zhi, it's time to charge.

419
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,000
All right.

420
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:11,810
Let's fight down the mountain!

421
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:25,620
(Li Yan's Mansion in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

422
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,190
A battlefield report from Chencang County.

423
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:29,890
Read it.

424
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:33,650
Governor Hao Zhao of Wei defended Chencang to the last.

425
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,370
General Wang Shuang arrived with help.

426
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,420
Our army was then caught in a dilemma.

427
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,970
For the reason of no army provisions, the Prime Minister

428
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,810
feigned several defeats and lured the enemy troops to his trap where he annihilated them.

429
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:44,360
General Wang Shuang was beheaded.

430
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,140
His head has been delivered to Chengdu.

431
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,430
Upon the arrival of the report,

432
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,310
our army will march to Mount Qi

433
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:52,050
and fight Guo Huai's main forces of Wei,

434
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,630
to conquer Tianshui and Shanggui

435
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:55,500
within a month.

436
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:56,320
Enough!

437
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,490
Send someone

438
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,840
to Jiangzhou immediately.

439
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,370
Start the second step.

440
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:15,860
Yes, sir.

441
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,050
Your Majesty,

442
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:36,920
I've received a secret report

443
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,710
that Emperor Sun Quan of Wu appeared to ally with Prime Minister Zhuge,

444
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:42,940
but has actually reached Zigui County.

445
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,950
He secretly asked Lu Xun to conquer Xichuan

446
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,250
in the name of attacking the Wei Army.

447
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,580
Two armies are heading for Jiangxia

448
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:51,250
and Yidu separately.

449
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:55,410
They want to invade our state along the river

450
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,210
when we're having the Northern Expedition against Wei.

451
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:09,740
Our crack troops are along Chencang Road and Mount Qi.

452
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,150
Wang Shuang was killed.

453
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,600
But it brought no harm to the Wei Army.

454
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:15,140
Chencang County isn't conquered yet.

455
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,950
No success has been achieved.

456
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,550
When being attacked from both sides,

457
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:22,260
our state is rather precarious.

458
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,700
Due to your secret edict,

459
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,650
I've been diligent in my work

460
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,050
day and night,

461
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:40,100
to repay you for your patronage and trust.

462
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,870
The Wu Army broke the alliance and invaded us

463
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:46,420
all because Prime Minister insisted on the Northern Expedition,

464
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,290
regardless of the blood feud of the late emperor.

465
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,030
I will ignore the difficulties,

466
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,040
take the risks,

467
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,980
and play it by ear.

468
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,140
As indicated in the secret edict,

469
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,000
I will have army provisions

470
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,790
sent to Yidu immediately.

471
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,290
Right away,

472
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:43,810
hurry to Chengdu personally

473
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:45,610
and meet

474
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:47,970
Chief Eunuch Huang Hao.

475
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,330
Ask him

476
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,490
to give this letter to His Majesty.

477
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,580
This is a very serious matter.

478
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:58,880
Don't let anything go wrong.

479
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,240
Yes, sir.

480
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:18,830
(Cavalry General's Mansion)

481
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,540
Wang Shuang's head

482
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:29,680
was sealed with lime

483
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,350
and specially delivered to Chengdu.

484
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,510
When His Majesty receives the report,

485
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:36,610
he will have fewer misgivings, I guess.

486
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,010
Our troops are heading for Longxi,

487
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,520
but I worry about the Hanzhong Region.

488
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,240
Li Yan doesn't get along with you, Prime Minister.

489
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,870
But I think he'll consider the overall situation.

490
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:51,290
When Chief Yang is mediating,

491
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,150
there won't be big problems.

492
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,680
In war, logistics matters most.

493
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:01,850
Without army provisions,

494
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:03,180
our troops

495
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,000
will be dead.

496
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,120
Under your command, General Wei Yan

497
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:09,639
has gone to guarantee the food transportation.

498
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,889
Rest assured, Prime Minister.

499
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:15,030
Wei Yan is brave.

500
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,370
But he isn't

501
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,480
thoughtful enough.

502
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:25,730
I'll go help him.

503
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,449
Deng Zhi, with your help, I'll be relieved.

504
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,239
General Li Yan has everything arranged.

505
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:50,480
The remaining army provisions

506
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:52,420
are ready to be delivered to Jiangzhou.

507
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,940
Upon receiving General Li Yan's token,

508
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,360
I'll have the army provisions sent.

509
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,100
I'm setting off.

510
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,300
Take care.

511
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:08,700
Everybody, hurry up!

512
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,670
(Upper reaches of the Mian River, the Shu State)
Everybody, hurry up!

513

(Upper reaches of the Mian River, the Shu State)

514
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:11,990
Hurry up.
(Upper reaches of the Mian River, the Shu State)

515
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:13,360
(Upper reaches of the Mian River, the Shu State)

516
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:13,890
Be quick, all of you!
(Upper reaches of the Mian River, the Shu State)

517
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:14,550
Be quick, all of you!

518
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,100
Here. Come on.

519
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,440
Hurry!

520
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:20,340
Hurry. Hurry.

521
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,120
Tell Chen Gong

522
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,990
that everything is ready.

523
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,850
Once the army provisions are transported through lower reaches,

524
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,420
ask him to send a signal immediately

525
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:51,930
and we will destroy the dam for floods.

526
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,240
If he fails,

527
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,660
I will kill him.

528
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,700
Everybody, hurry up!

529
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,050
Hurry! Hurry!

530
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:41,890
Lin Liang?

531
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:46,570
Why did Chen Gong lock me up here?

532
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:48,210
I only deliver meals to you.

533
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:50,010
I don't know anything else.

534
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,840
If you struggle,

535
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,960
you'll die today.

536
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,280
Chen Gong did everything to save you.

537
00:36:59,160 --> 00:36:59,960
Don't be silly.

538
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:04,010
Xun Xu.

539
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:05,530
Xun Xu,

540
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,100
Chen Gong is your true friend.

541
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:09,820
Ask yourself.

542
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:11,170
Will he hurt you?

543
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,160
Go tell Chen Gong.

544
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:30,130
No matter what he wants to do,

545
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:33,360
he should come and tell me personally.

546
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:36,720
I'll be waiting here for him!

547
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,030
He isn't in Nanzheng County now.

548
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:41,240
You have to wait for a few more days.

549
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,790
Where has he gone?

550
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,280
Under General Li Yan's command to coordinate army provisions,

551
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:47,880
he has gone to Mount Dingjun.

552
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,290
Xun Xu,

553
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,390
there's medication in the water

554
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,610
you're offered.

555
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,060
It heals your wound.

556
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,660
Don't forget to drink it.

557
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:06,390
Tell him

558
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,600
to come and see me personally!

559
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,230
(Li Yan's Villa in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

560
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,380

(Li Yan's Villa in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

562
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,220
I left my bamboo flute in the study.

563
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:47,310
I'm going to get it.

564
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,810
General Li commanded

565
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,240
that no one could enter his study,

566
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:51,830
but him.

567
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,250
I'll come out after getting the bamboo flute.

568
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,250
It will only take a few minutes.

569
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,440
Sorry, Miss Liu,

570
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,370
but I have to follow General's order.

571
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:02,050
Don't put me on the spot.

572
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:03,280
Leave, please.

573
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,050
All right, then.

574
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:18,610
Miss Liu,

575
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,530
I've brought you some hot water.

576
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,850
Look.

577
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,030
How do I look in this?

578
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,730
Cheers, Generals.

579
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:02,210
Cheers.

(Sanguan Pass, the Shu State)

When the army provisions are handed over to General Wei Yan,

583
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:11,950
I can finally let out a sigh of relief.

584
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:16,800
Our vanguards have conquered Wudu and Yinping.

585
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,970

Hu Zhong, why do you still worry?
(Wei Yan, General to Suppress the North of Shu)

590
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,890
General Wei Yan, you're famous for your prestige.

591
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:28,020
No enemies dare to fight you.

592
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,850
But I'm not experienced in wars.

593
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:31,170
I can't help feeling scared.

594
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:35,990
Come on.

595
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,350
You've worked for General Li Yan for so long

596
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:39,930
that you talk like him.

597
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:41,600
You say something but mean something else.

598
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:43,960
I don't dare.

599
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,570
General Wei Yan, don't be kidding.

600
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:47,580
This time,

601
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,160
the plank road in the west was destroyed in mud-rock flows

602
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,560
and couldn't be repaired in a short time.

603
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:53,960
The war situation in the east is unstable, too.

604
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:55,690
Sorry for the trouble, General Wei Yan.

605
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,010
I'd like to make a toast

606

608
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:04,170
drinking too much causes trouble.

When Xu Chu escorted the army provisions,

610
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,230
he was drunk and defeated by Zhang Fei

611
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,950
so that the food transport was cut off.

612
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,520
General, you must be careful.

613
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:14,570
It's just a couple of cups of wine.

614

00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,930
Alright. I shan't waste any time.

622
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,290
I'll take my leave.

623

It's heavily raining now.

The scheme against Qingping Plan

has been ongoing.

To win the trust of the Wei Army,

Chen Gong told them Li Yan's plan

to cut off the army provisions for the Northern Expedition.

Taking this opportunity,

642
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:35,260
Guo Huai ordered Huang Yu to rob the army provisions

643
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:36,940
and defend Chencang County for a month.

644
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:38,410
He ordered

645
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,210
that Chencang shouldn't

646
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:40,630
be conquered

However, Prime Minister is

649
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:45,590
quite resourceful.

650
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:48,340
He did something very unexpected.

651
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:50,040
He ordered his troops to attack Chencang

652
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:51,520
so that the Wei Army

653

would be caught by surprise.

654
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:55,990
Chencang fell and the Wei Army suffered heavy casualties.

Li Yan thought

656
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:00,850
his deception of army provisions

657
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:02,580
could hold back Prime Minister Zhuge.

You didn't expect it, did you?

659
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:06,830
It's just a false image.

that Huang Yu of Wuxian Sect

suddenly appeared in the Shu State,

666
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,080
he felt suspicious.

667
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:21,730
But he still went there to check it out.

On his way,

669
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:25,690
