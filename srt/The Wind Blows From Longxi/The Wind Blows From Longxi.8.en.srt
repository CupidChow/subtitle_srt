1
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:34,990
(The Wind Blows from Longxi)

2
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,960
(The Eighth Strategy Disturb the Water to Catch the Fish)

3
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:44,710
(Canyon in Wuxian Sect's domain, Border of the Shu State)

4
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,650
Mister Mi,

5
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,610
why aren't you resting in your cave?

6
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,640
I rested in my cave the whole night.

7
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,079
I came here for some fresh air.

8
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,260
This place is

9
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,829
known as Immortal Valley.

10
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:26,960
In those years

11
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,600
when Emperor Wu started a war against Shu,

12
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,260
Zhang Lu's younger brother Zhang Wei

13
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,030
pitched their tents here.

14
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,660
Then why is this valley laid waste?

15
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,090
Before,

16
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,520
an army was stationed here.

17
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:41,210
An old immortal came for geomancy.

18
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,060
He said the valley was concave in the center

19
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,630
and convex out there,

20
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,660
looking like a trap.

21
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:49,430
The Emperor of Shu believed in superstition and had the army withdrawn.

22
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,030
Our sect then occupied this place.

23
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,190
Why do I think

24
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:55,970
this valley gives a feeling of reviving?

25
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:56,450
Look.

26
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,510
The shape looks like a tiger and dragon.

27
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,320
Not bad.

28
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,350
Mister Mi, you sound

29
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,180
quite like Leader Huang.

30
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,730
Great minds like you think alike.

31
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,080
I'm afraid it's going to rain.

32
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:15,650
The rain

33
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,550
will be heavy.

34
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,620
Mister Mi,

35
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,630
shall we go back?

36
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,350
I'd like to stay for a little bit longer.

37
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,140
But it's going to rain.

38
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:29,970
Let's get back first.

39
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:32,650
Alright.

40
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,770
No one requested to read

41
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,620
the original of Jieting's false intelligence case.

42
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,920
If I request to read it,

43
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,150
I'm afraid Clerk Feng will be annoyed.

44
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,130
Alright. I'll think of a solution.

45
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,040
Good.

46
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,740
Clerk Feng asked me to go to Yangping Pass today

47
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,900
to verify the dead Wei spy.

48
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,740
It's a long-term mission to investigate Zhulong.

49
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,910
You don't need to hurry.

50
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:21,769
Xun Xu,

51
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,590
I'm giving you the code-cracking plates.

52
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,690
Keep them in the Internal Affairs Department.

53
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,050
Aye.

54
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,540
Do keep them carefully.

55
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,370
I signed for them.

56
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,909
Don't worry, Clerk Li.

57
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,190
I'll have someone take care of them.

58
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,920
Pei Xu.

59
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,300
Chief Xun.

60
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,480
Get packed

61
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,700
and go to Yangping Pass with me.

62
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,350
Then we need to take the ponchos.

63
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:42,810
Looks like it's going to rain heavily.

64
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,550
Fine.

65
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,030
Where's Ma Sheng?

66
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,360
His father-in-law is badly sick.

67
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,750
He's going to ask for a leave.

68
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,510
Well, I have to leave this to you.

69
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,560
This is important evidence.

70
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,760
Tonight, keep watch over it.

71
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,070
Don't let anything go wrong.

72
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:58,830
Aye.

73
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,980
It's heavy.

74
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,050
What's in it?

75
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,670
We don't look, ask, or know anything.

76
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,200
Three rules of the Internal Affairs Department.

77
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:06,830
Keep them in mind.

78
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,810
Whatever it is,

79
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,100
I'll guard it like guarding my own life.

80
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:14,810
Chief Xun.

81
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,300
Chief Xun,

82
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,010
I'm sorry.

83
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,680
It's all right.

84
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,890
Liao Hui told me about your problem.

85
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,990
Come back early.

86
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,870
We're short of men lately.

87
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,250
Thank you, Chief Xun.

88
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,350
Off you go.

89
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,740
I buried the two Bamboo Kites

90
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:40,180
on my way to the Shu State.

91
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,890
Have someone dig them out early.

92
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,130
Yes.

93
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,159
I'll tell you where they're buried.

94
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,840
Sure.

95
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,040
Don't worry. Mister Mi. It'll be done soon.

96
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:46,830
Thank you.

97
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,659
Elders,

98
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,200
keep watch carefully

99
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,300
and leave nothing to chance.

100
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,130
Aye.

101
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,659
Leader Huang, what are you doing?

102
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,140
There you are.

103
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,060
Today, I was informed that

104
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:58,240
(Huang Yu, the Leader of Wuxian Sect)
Today, I was informed that

105
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,530
(Huang Yu, the Leader of Wuxian Sect)

106
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,500
the man who traveled with you
(Huang Yu, the Leader of Wuxian Sect)

107
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,770
turned out to be Baidi, a Shu spy.

108
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,680
Recorder Chen?

109
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,060
Are you aware of that?

110
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,920
Luckily, he's dead.

111
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:23,590
One more thing.

112
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,130
Governor Guo

113
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,640
sent two messengers

114
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,410
to bring us a secret order.

115
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:29,980
They're arriving tonight.

116
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,030
Tonight?

117
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,440
Mm.

118
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,450
By then, I'll treat them to a feast.

119
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,540
You can also catch up on them.

120
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,040
Isn't that great?

121
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,470
Mm.

122
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,020
I'll keep them company.

123
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,650
Recorder Chen.

124
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,180
A lot more subordinates?

125
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,310
Messengers are coming from Tianshui.

126
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,470
It's a very important thing.

127
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,230
Leader Huang especially asked us

128
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,260
to have more men patrol around

129
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,110
in case Shu spies infiltrate us.

130
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,720
Good plan.

131
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,060
Mister Mi,

132
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,840
don't be late for tonight's feast.

133
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,100
Thank you for reminding me.

134
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,110
Rest assured.

135
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,490
Keep a close eye on him.

136
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,790
If he wants to run away,

137
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:24,830
kill him.

138
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:25,620
Aye.

139
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,890
(Yangping Pass, Border of the Shu State)

140
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,730
Pei Xu, hurry.

141
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,420
General Xu.

142
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,960
At last, you've come.

143
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,520
Examine the dead body quickly.

144
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:48,550
It's already stinking.

145
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,250
We were so busy with work

146
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,150
that we came one day late.

147
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,230
Come with me.

148
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,880
I won't get in with you.

149
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,820
The writing brush and ink are on the table against the wall.

150
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,380
Thanks.

151
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,480
Baidi is quite impressive.

152
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,159
The dead man is nearly 180 cm.

153
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:41,909
His face is tanned.

154
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,380
His hands are fair-skinned without scars.

155
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,100
He's likely

156
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,060
to be a rich merchant

157
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,020
or an official.

158
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,870
Governor Guo sent two messengers

159
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,500
to bring us a secret order.

160
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:00,690
They're arriving tonight.

161
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,310
Mister Mi,

162
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,660
Leader Huang ordered

163
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,080
that no one should go out.

164
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,990
I'm... I'm going to the toilet.

165
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,140
Go get the commode and toilet paper for him.

166
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:32,780
Aye.

167
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:36,980
Be quick.

168
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,960
A tattoo on the inner side of his right arm.

169
00:09:59,070 --> 00:09:59,980
It's honeysuckle.

170
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,710
Honeysuckle is

171
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,410
the insignia of the Chen Clan

172
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,150
in Changsha, the Wu State.

173
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,940
Where are his belongings?

174
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:09,820
We need to check them.

175
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,090
They're in the room next door.

176
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,580
Come out if you're done.

177
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,690
I'll take you there.

178
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,880
What?

179
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,700
Did he do anything strange?

180
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,120
He came out once,

181
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:25,530
asking to go to the toilet.

182
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:28,600
He was too anxious to stay.

183
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,220
Our men are around his cave

184
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,980
and the periphery is more heavily guarded.

185
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,300
There's no way he can escape.

186
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,730
But...

187
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:37,990
Go on.

188
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,400
Today, Mister Mi

189
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,180
looked very calm.

190
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,180
He's a chancellor, anyway.

191
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,400
He can at least remain calm.

192
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:49,860
After seven in the evening,

193
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,610
withdraw all the guards

194
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,650
out of his cave.

195
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,140
Then won't we be giving him a chance to escape?

196
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,070
I just want to see

197
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,240
whether he's with us

198
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,650
or against us.

199
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,820
Don't let anything go wrong

200
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,090
with the two messengers.

201
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,220
Or I shall hold you solely responsible.

202
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,010
Aye.

203
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,340
It's a copy of the autopsy report.

204
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,970
General Xu, please give it to General Ma Dai.

205
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,410
Chief Xun, I need your fingerprint on it.

206
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:34,100
Sure.

207
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,400
Without your fingerprint,

208
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:45,340
we don't dare to bury the body even if it stinks.

209
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,340
Sorry to keep you waiting, General Xu.

210
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,440
It's raining so heavily.

211
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,980
Why not stay for tonight and leave tomorrow?

212
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:52,400
No, thanks.

213
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,140
Clerks are waiting for my report.

214
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,640
You're fine with the rain,

215
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,390
but your horses are not.

216
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,270
Chief Xun, General Xu is right.

217
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:01,980
On such cold days,

218
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,620
it'll be big trouble if the horses get sick.

219
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,180
Alright, then.

220
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,470
Thank you for accommodating us, General Xu.

221
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,230
No problem.

222
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,910
(Siwencao Intelligence, Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

223
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,140
Stop unloading the goods.

224
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,490
Or they'd be soaked in the rain.

225
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,180
Wait until the rain stops.

226
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,340
Move them to the warehouse first.

227
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,210
Go.

228
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,030
Come on.

229
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:35,600
Be careful.

230
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,270
Watch your steps.

231
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,490
Right. Put the box over there.

232
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,020
Put it in the corner. Right.

233
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,310
It looks ugly there.

234
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:44,610
Right.

235
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,550
There.

236
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,580
Come on, the screen.

237
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,500
At my command,

238
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,920
a little bit to this side.

239
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,110
Only a little bit.

240
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:50,880
A little bit more to this side.

241
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,400
Block the window to some extent.

242
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,770
Clerk Li's room has a western exposure to sunlight.

243
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,590
It's so considerate of you, Chief Sun.

244
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,560
What are our jobs?

245
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,420
When our superiors want something, we must do it very well.

246
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,850
For what they don't expect yet,

247
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,010
we should do better.

248
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,910
Who are the two men?

249
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,590
Judging from their belongings,

250
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:22,110
those two Wei spies traveled to our state through Xiegu Valley by land.

251
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,970
The token is from Wuxian Sect.

252
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,300
Wuxian Sect?

253
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:26,900
Right.

254
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:27,740
Are you sure?

255
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,440
Yes.

256
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:29,610
Obviously,

257
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,230
they had help from Wuxian Sect.

258
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,100
The dead man is Chen Wei.

259
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,550
I guess it's his alias.

260
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,330
But he's indeed from the Chen Clan in Changsha.

261
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,410
I'm not sure about the identity

262
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:44,610
of the other Wei spy who ran away.

263
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,490
When he comes out, take him down immediately.

264
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,110
Yes.

265
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,170
Chancellor Mi?

266
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:03,900
At last, you've come.

267
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,760
Sorry, Leader Huang,

268
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,960
I'm late.

269
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,520
Be seated, please.

270
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:20,990
Leader Huang,

271
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,480
who's this?

272
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,150
Commandant Han,

273
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,370
this is Chancellor Mi from Tianshui.

274
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,080
Don't you know him?

275
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,140
Leader Huang,

276
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,020
he isn't Chancellor Mi.

277
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:53,290
Chancellor Mi,

278
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,020
what is Commandant Han

279
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:57,930
talking about?

280
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,580
Who are

281
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,050
these two men?

282
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,160
Didn't you say two guests

283
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,589
would come from Tianshui?

284
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,829
When I was in Tianshui,

285
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,089
I never saw these two men.

286
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm Commandant Han of the Intelligence Agency from Chang'an.

287
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,750
Under the command of Regional Inspector Guo Huai,

288
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,099
I went to Tianshui to meet Governor Guo Gang.

289
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:27,480
Guo Gang asked me to bring the secret letter here

290
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:30,900
just because I knew Chancellor Mi.

291
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,670
So,

292
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,140
I won't

293
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:36,880
let Leader Huang

294
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,140
get tricked by a Shu spy.

295
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,060
Commandant Han,

296
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,250
if this man isn't Mi Chong,

297
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,420
who can he be?

298
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,420
Can you be Baidi, the Shu spy?

299
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,540
You killed Mi Chong,

300
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,900
replaced him,

301
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,520
and sneaked into Wuxian Sect

302
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,300
in his name, right?

303
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,530
Chancellor Mi,

304
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,480
is it true?

305
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,910
The stars are few, and the moon is bright.

306
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,110
The raven southward wings its flight.

307
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,300
What?

308
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,470
The stars are few, and the moon is bright.

309
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,260
The raven southward wings its flight.

310
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,740
The stars are few, and the moon is bright.

311
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,440
The raven southward wings its flight.

312
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,050
A secret code?

313
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,300
Isn't it the rule

314
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,730
for the fieldwork of chancellors?

315
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,510
I came from Tianshui.

316
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,860
Governor Guo Gang had a secret code with me.

317
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,590
If Governor Guo sent you here,

318
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:54,250
he must have told you about the code.

319
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,950
What is the following part of the code?

320
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:56,980
Say it.

321
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:00,980
Say it.

322
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:04,330
Shu spy,

323
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,290
you're tricking us.

324
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,040
The code is fake!

325
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:09,450
You...

326
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:14,890
Do you dare to go back to Tianshui with me

327
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,650
and confront Governor Guo?

328
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,600
Do you?

329
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,830
What about you?

330
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,160
Do you dare?

331
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,190
Leader Huang,

332
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,910
I hear members of the Chen Clan in Changsha

333
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,500
have the tattoo of honeysuckle on their bodies.

334
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,340
Now that we have a dispute,

335
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,900
why don't you ask Mister Mi to vindicate himself?

336
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,380
Leader Huang.

337
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,020
Vindicate yourself.

338
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:51,660
Do it, please.

339
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:36,940
Chancellor Mi,

340
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:38,890
sorry for the offence.

341
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,380
Didn't you say you came from Chang'an?

342
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:50,020
Why do you use the swordsmanship of Yizhou?

343
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,260
So,

344
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,600
you're the Shu spy.

345
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,700
Leader Huang,

346
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,590
help!

347
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,190
Shu spies!

348
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,920
How dare you try to deceive me!

349
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,750
Chancellor Mi, it's wise of you.

350
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,460
Or I would have been tricked by them.

351
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,030
Sorry.

352
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,190
Never mind, Leader Huang.

353
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:57,980
I came here just to find out spies.

354
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,230
It's my obligation.

355
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,990
You make sense, Chancellor Mi.

356
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,420
Qin Ze,

357
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,360
take Chancellor Mi

358
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,080
to have a good rest.

359
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:08,910
Aye.

360
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,060
(Li Yan's Camp, Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

361
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:13,990
General Li Yan impeached the Prime Minister with other officials.
(Li Yan's Camp, Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

362
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:16,220
General Li Yan impeached the Prime Minister with other officials.

363
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,750
He was quite determined.

364
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:22,830
It's a make-or-break move.

365
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,590
Even if Zhuge Liang isn't overthrown,

366
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,490
he would at least lose some helpers.

367
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,540
To be honest,

368
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,610
General Li Yan is not happy about you.

369
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,500
I know. I know.

370
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,680
I've worked in Siwencao Intelligence for two months,

371
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,610
but haven't got anything on Yang Yi.

372
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:43,430
Li Miao,

373
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,860
there are only three days to go

374
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,060
before the next meeting.

375
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,280
Fine.

376
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,350
Within three days,

377
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,460
I'll have some useful intelligence sent to Chengdu.

378
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,480
What Xun Xu said

379
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,110
was only his suspicion.

380
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,290
It's not very helpful, is it?

381
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:09,340
Xun Xu's report is just a pretext.

382
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,950
I've already arranged for Yin Ji

383
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:16,320
to frame Feng Ying up.

384
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,270
Is it appropriate?

385
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,160
As long as we can succeed, it doesn't matter how.

386
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:33,310
You mustn't let anyone else know it.

387
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:36,010
I know what to do.

388
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,360
Chen Gong,

389
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,400
hang on.

390
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,740
Summarize the travel records of other departments

391
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,140
and send them to Siwencao Intelligence.

392
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,770
Clerk Feng, you checked them personally.

393
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:52,850
Do we still need to summarize them?

394
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:54,640
You didn't need to before.

395
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,310
But now, there's a rule.

396
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,380
I'll file the records

397
00:24:58,690 --> 00:24:59,410
and send them by the end of this month.

398
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,550
Clerk Feng.

399
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:04,820
Chief Yin?

400
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:06,760
What's up?

401
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,830
Nothing.

402
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:08,940
I was just passing by

403
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,170
when I saw you here.

404
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,060
An urgent report came from Chengdu.

405
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:14,450
I left it on your desk.

406
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:24,080
Didn't you give it to Clerk Li?

407
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,350
Theoretically, the report from Chengdu

408
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:28,030
should be reviewed by you first.

409
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,710
Have to go.

410
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,020
Back to my office.

411
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,100
See you, Clerk Feng.

412
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,250
Clerk Feng, why are you back?

413
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:57,590
Black bear back to the lair.

414
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,590
Open the door!

415
00:25:59,140 --> 00:25:59,790
Open the door!

416
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,610
What happened?

417
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:01,720
Why was the door locked so early today?

418
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,620
It's raining heavily.

419
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,210
In case of floodwaters,

420
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,280
Clerk Li asked everyone to leave two hours early.

421
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,670
Where's the urgent report Chief Yin left for me?

422
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,290
Here, Clerk Feng.

423
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:31,880
You're allowed to go off work early.

424
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,140
Does anyone still stay?

425
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,760
Yes, some of the Internal Affairs Department.

426
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,080
You may leave, too.

427
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:37,830
I'll go have a look.

428
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:03,780
Clerk Feng.

429
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,310
Everybody else has gone home. Why are you still here?

430
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,330
Some evidence is kept in the locker.

431
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,070
Chief Xun asked me to stay on duty.

432
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,480
Alright. Do your work.

433
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,360
Aye.

434
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,630
Mister Mi, sorry that we startled you.

435
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:08,590
Our sect has more than 4,000 members.

436
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,300
There are 257 Elders below me.

437
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,440
From this day on,

438
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,440
we'll all listen to you.

439
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:17,370
You flatter me.

440
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,500
I'm a mere chancellor.

441
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,590
But you're General Who Pacifies the South titled by His Majesty.

442
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,340
I don't deserve your salute.

443
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,120
Don't be modest.

444
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,700
You saved me from Shu spies.

445
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:31,090
We shouldn't judge by titles.

446
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,900
If you don't mind,

447
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,740
I want to be your sworn brother.

448
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,080
What do you think?

449
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:41,930
I'd love to.

450
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,780
Now we're brothers.

451
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:49,770
Isn't it God's will

452
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,310
that I can have a helper like you?

453
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,710
This is the Saint Lady.

454
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,870
I haven't married her yet.

455
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,720
But you can already treat her as my wife.

456
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,270
Greetings...

457
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,140
Greetings, my lady.

458
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,020
Nice to meet you, Mister Mi.

459
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,260
I haven't prepared a present.

460
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,520
As the saying goes,

461
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,310
a hero deserves a treasured sword.

462
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,660
This sword is extremely sharp.

463
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,330
It's kind of a treasure.

464
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,340
Take it as a present for our first meeting.

465
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:41,420
What a good sword!

466
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:44,860
Thank you, my lady.

467
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,920
Some other day, I'll have her

468
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,920
show you how powerful our sect is.

469
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,750
Great.

470
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:54,130
Saint Lady,

471
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,620
we have something important to talk about.

472
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,060
You may leave us.

473
00:29:58,730 --> 00:29:59,450
Aye.

474
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:11,950
Chen Gong,

475
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,540
do you have any other important mission

476
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,300
when you're in the Hanzhong region?

477
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,370
Yes, of course.

478
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:21,710
Qingping Plan.

479
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,100
I'm all ears.

480
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,940
To review the original of Jieting's false intelligence case,

481
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:32,620
we need Clerk Feng's signature.

482
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,650
It's not easy to get that.

483
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,030
Baidi's original file is kept in the Document Chamber.

484
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:40,950
-Wei Liang in the Document Chamber is my friend.
-No.

485
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,100
We mustn't let anyone else know.

486
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:44,620
We have to do it secretly.

487
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,420
Got it.

488
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:53,110
(Siwencao Intelligence, Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

489
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,150
What's going on here?

490
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:00,600
So many guards.

491
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:03,620
Something must have happened.

492
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:17,170
Stop!

493
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,230
Who are you? Where are you going?

494
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,020
I'm Xun Xu of the Internal Affairs Department.

495
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,600
What happened?

496
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:25,890
Chief Xun.

497
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:29,120
General Hu Zhong?

498
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,430
Come over.

499
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:31,830
Go, please.

500
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:45,910
What are you dawdling for?

501
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,060
Quickly.

502
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,220
Take the evidence out.

503
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:03,860
Where's Liao Hui?

504
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,580
Chief Xun, where were you last night?

505
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,630
Yesterday, Pei Xu and I

506
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,670
went to Yangping Pass under the command of Clerk Feng

507
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:13,900
to verify the dead Wei spy.

508
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,350
It was raining so heavily

509
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:18,060
that General Xu of Yangping Pass

510
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:19,700
allowed us to live there last night.

511
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:20,360
We just came back.

512
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:26,170
What happened to Liao Hui?

513
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,750
Yesterday evening, due to the heavy rain,

514
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,380
staff members of Siwencao Intelligence went off work two hours early.

515
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:33,890
According to the preliminary inspection,

516
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,010
a big theft happened here.

517
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:41,150
Both the Intelligence Analysis and the Operations lost something.

518
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,350
Liao Hui was on duty at that time

519
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,850
and he was murdered.

520
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,710
Liao Hui is dead?

521
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,470
Yes. He's dead.

522
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:10,720
He was stabbed in the chest.

523
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,540
Leave us.

524
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,900
Chief Gao Tangbing was the first

525
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,970
to discover Liao Hui's dead body.

526
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,750
At around a quarter past nine.

527
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,800
Many staff members had arrived then,

528
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,480
including Clerk Li and Clerk Feng.

529
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:52,910
Chief Gao found something missing in his room.

530
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,940
He then reported it to Clerk Feng.

531
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,500
Unexpectedly,

532
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,690
other departments also lost things.

533
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,680
But no such report from the Internal Affairs Department.

534
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,610
Clerk Feng then asked Chief Gao to check it out.

535
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,370
After discussion, Clerk Li and Clerk Feng

536
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,590
had the case reported to General Li Yan's Camp immediately.

537
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,560
Those were not our coroners, right?

538
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,969
Upon receiving the report,

539
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,480
I had a letter sent to Chengdu

540
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,139
and took General Li Yan's squad here

541
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:31,900
with coroners of the Nanzheng County Government.

542
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:36,210
We just had the preliminary inspection of the crime scene.

543
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,310
You just told me

544
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,179
that Liao Hui died during the struggle.

545
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,670
But there are no signs of a struggle on his body.

546
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:54,610
Does it matter?

547
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,180
You should have asked something else.

548
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:58,640
I know.

549
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,060
Baidi's code-cracking plates

550
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:02,820
kept in our department were stolen.

551
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:04,170
Exactly.

552
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:08,040
Xun Xu is the Chief of the Internal Affairs Department.

553
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:10,180
He's good at solving cases.

554
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:14,590
General Hu Zhong, why bother

555
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,670
having local officers investigate the case?

556
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:17,530
Someone in Siwencao Intelligence may have colluded with the murderer.

557
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:18,860
I can't be too careful!

558
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,780
Xun Xu stayed over at Yangping Pass, right?

559
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,320
He's in no way the murderer.

560
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:28,010
He should preside over the investigation.

561
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,480
Chief Xun, you just checked the crime scene.

562
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:34,710
I guess you have got some clues, right?

563
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,880
This is a case involving Wei spies.

564
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,550
And it's directly related to Baidi's case.

565
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:46,850
What makes you think so?

566
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,910
Pei Xu

567
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,200
summarized the lost items

568
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,280
of all departments.

569
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:58,940
Chief Yin of the Operations Department

570
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,510
lost a valuable paperweight

571
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,420
that was made in the Pre-Qin period.

572
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,740
The other lost items are insignificant.

573
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:06,170
So,

574
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,130
what the burglar really wanted

575
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,470
were Baidi's code-cracking plates

576
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,610
kept in the Internal Affairs Department.

577
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:15,750
He has a point.

578
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,970
Why are they kept in the Internal Affairs Department?

579
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,510
About that,

580
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:23,980
I know the reason.

581
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:34,340
I'm Chief Sun Ling of the scribe room.

582
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:35,960
I have some business to report to Clerk Feng.

583
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:36,980
Chief Sun,

584
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,410
under the command of General Hu Zhong,

585
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,620
no one in Siwencao Intelligence shall wander around

586
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,480
before the investigation is over.

587
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,790
Why isn't it over yet?

588
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:48,850
Haven't they already stopped?

589
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:57,550
I guess the investigation will take a while.

590
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:58,780
Have a rest.

591
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,730
What?

592
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:09,920
General Hu Zhong doesn't allow you to speak?

593
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,360
Is the investigation finally over?

594
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,080
Looks like

595
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:20,770
the coroners of Nanzheng County Government

596
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:21,600
didn't work very efficiently.

597
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,060
Feng Ying, you're under arrest.

598
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:25,470
What?

599
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,140
What crime have I done?

600
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,870
The report was sent to Chengdu.

601
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,230
General Li Yan will return to Nanzheng County soon.

602
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:36,940
You'd better ask him.

603
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,300
Don't be ridiculous.

604
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:42,140
Hu Zhong, you're General Li Yan's henchman.

605
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:44,120
But we aren't subordinate to each other.

606
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:45,910
Why do you think you can arrest me?

607
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:47,590
Get him.

608
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,100
Feng Ying,

609
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:57,820
are you going to revolt?

610
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,740
You colluded with Wei spies and murdered a man.

611
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:08,970
There's irrefutable evidence!

612
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:10,030
Arrest him!

613
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:13,970
General Hu Zhong,

614
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,960
don't you want my testimony?

615
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:19,970
Maybe later.

616
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,310
Isn't it

617
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,530
such a hasty decision?

618
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:32,800
At the time of emergency,

619
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:34,600
we have to make a prompt decision.

620
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,470
Yesterday,

621
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,680
staff members went off two hours early.

622
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,200
Only a few of them stayed.

623
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,820
Feng Ying's attendant

624
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,200
confessed

625
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:50,670
that when the murder was committed,

626
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:52,760
Feng Ying returned

627
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,660
and talked to Liao Hui

628
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,400
in the Internal Affairs Department.

629
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,300
Other people

630
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,560
have witnesses

631
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,560
to prove their alibis.

632
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:05,870
As recorded in the investigation sheet,

633
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:10,670
no stranger sneaked into Siwencao Intelligence,

634
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,130
right?

635
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:14,630
Right.

636
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:19,390
Feng Ying is the only suspect.

637
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:20,980
It's the first reason.

638
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:21,850
Second,

639
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:24,000
you told me

640
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,140
you suspected that Feng Ying and Sun Ling

641
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,200
had something to do with Jieting's false intelligence case.

642
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:30,600
Then Feng Ying had the motive

643
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,890
to steal Baidi's code-cracking plates.

644
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:34,660
So,

645
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:37,040
Feng Ying is highly suspicious.

646
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,150
Don't you agree?

647
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,230
Here.

648
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,590
It's the investigation sheet

649
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,170
and the interrogation of Feng Ying.

650
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:49,850
Sign it.

651
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:51,990
It must be delivered to Chengdu immediately.

652
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,300
This is also why

653
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:57,220
Clerk Feng may not be the murderer.

654
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:58,570
What?

655
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,490
In Siwencao Intelligence,

656
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,170
we do different jobs.

657
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:04,850
But in nature,

658
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:07,620
we all use every possible way

659
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:09,770
to kill the enemy and obtain intelligence.

660
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,910
Clerk Feng is one of the founders of Siwencao Intelligence.

661
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,500
He's proficient in getting intelligence.

662
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:17,510
He wouldn't make such a stupid mistake!

663
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:20,790
Xun Xu,

664
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:24,450
maybe Feng Ying just made use of this.

665
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,430
He predicted

666
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,360
that you would think like this.

667
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:28,470
In this way,

668
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:30,690
you fell into his trap.

669
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,410
Your speculation

670
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:38,880
may be true.

671
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,740
But it was rather risky.

672
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,100
You said that before.

673
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,310
Playing tricks

674
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:47,730
on the original or translation of intelligence

675
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,880
would be too risky and unprofessional.

676
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,560
But facts prove

677
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:54,210
that Wei spies achieve unexpected success

678
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,910
with unprofessional methods.

679
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:57,900
The loss of Baidi's code-cracking plates

680
00:40:57,930 --> 00:40:59,060
just proves

681
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:01,280
that we may have guessed correctly

682
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:03,240
so that Feng Ying

683
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:04,950
made a reckless move

684
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:07,340
in desperation.

685
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:11,960
But I still think

686
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,390
this is a little bit unconvincing.

687
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,360
Xun Xu,

688
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:22,330
what you just said is

689
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,980
only your speculation,

690
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:27,380
right?

691
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:30,990
What's recorded in the investigation sheet

692
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:32,860
is the truth,

693
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:34,260
right?

694
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,820
Now that it's true,

695
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,790
sign the sheet.

696
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:49,020
If you still have some confusion

697
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:51,640
and want to continue the investigation,

698
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:53,580
no problem.

699
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,110
Sign the sheet and have it delivered to Chengdu.

700
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:58,650
Then you can continue the investigation.

701
00:41:58,940 --> 00:41:59,830
I support you.

702
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,750
These things aren't inconsistent.

703
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:04,340
You must understand.

704
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:08,260
Even though General Li Yan is in Chengdu,

705
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,020
he's still seriously concerned about this case.

706
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,630
We have to report the progress of the investigation

707
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:18,170
without delay.

708
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:45,780
There we go.

709
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,760
You shouldn't investigate a case

710
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:51,030
upon personal feelings.

711
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,910
Everything must be based on facts.

712
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:14,160
(The 24 Strategies of War, The Wind Blows from Longxi)
(Intelligence Agency in Longxi)

713
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,280
(The Eighth Strategy Disturb the Water to Catch the Fish)

714
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:20,060
Bad news!

715
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:20,800
You know what?

716
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,470
There's a theft and murder

717
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:24,050
within Siwencao Intelligence.

718
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,160
Baidi's code-cracking plates

719
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:28,340
kept in the Internal Affairs Department were stolen.

720
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,650
And the thief

721
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:31,810
killed Xun Xu's subordinate.

722
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,380
Meanwhile,

723
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:36,930
the new Chief Clerk, Li Miao

724
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:39,900
colluded with General Hu Zhong

725
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,000
to plant it on my brother-in-law, Feng Ying.

726
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:43,720
While Siwencao is in turmoil,

727
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,900
Wuxian Sect received new intelligence

728
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,160
from Zhulong,

729
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:49,710
stating that Chen Gong is the Shu spy, Baidi.

730
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:52,030
Huang Yu is a suspicious man.

731
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,310
And this message arouses his suspicion

732
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,780
on the man he claimed to be Chancellor Mi,

733
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,810
so he set up a dinner party to test him,

734
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,340
hoping to find loopholes in him.

735
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,400
This is a dead end.

736
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:07,340
Chen Gong decided to run away

737
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:10,470
until he found something weird in Wuxian Sect.

738
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:13,290
So he returned to the dinner party.

739
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,790
Facing the two

740
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,630
Wei envoys' questioning,

741
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:18,800
Chen Gong was at a disadvantage.

742
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:19,810
Fortunately,

743
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,400
Di Yue's hint

744
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,350
helped him turn the table.

745
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:25,720
The couple cooperated tactfully.

746
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,310
Chen Gong disturbed the water

747
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:29,640
and made up a code.

748
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:31,860
Allaying suspicion on himself,

749
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:33,460
Chen Gong continued to stay undercover.

750
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:35,510
Can the Chen couple

751
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:37,180
keep staying undercover?

752
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:40,050
What kind of interrogation is awaiting Feng Ying,

753
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,950
the prime suspect of the theft?

754
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,650
To know the answers,

755
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,830
keep watching tomorrow.

756
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:47,280
And remember,

757
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:48,470
I'm Sun Ling.
