00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,620
How dare you kill him?
(Adjutant to the Prime Minister, the Shu State)
(Li Miao)

144
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,159
This

145
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,650
is the Prime Minister's order.

146
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,290
Prime Minister.

147
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,420
Prime Minister.

148
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:58,780
I beg you

149
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,260
to forgive Ma Su!

150
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,830
Back Then, Sun Bin could gain victory

151
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,980
because he adhered to strict military rules.

152
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,930
Now that we are facing strong rivals,

153
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:11,900
and the war has just started,

154
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,860
how could we abolish the rules?

155
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,020
The war has not come to an end yet.

156
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,740
It'll be a great loss to our Shu

157
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,420
if we kill a loyal and talented general!

158
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,780
The Qin State pardoned Meng Ming,

159
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,610
and then annexed more than 20 countries of Xirong.

160
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,720
Stop talking nonsense!

161
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,460
Jieting is a crucial fortress to us.

162
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,980
Ma Su took the military order

163
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,260
and swore on the lives of his whole family

164
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,550
to guard Jieting.

165
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:36,980
And what happened now?

166
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,810
Now

167
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,780
we suffered a terrible defeat

168
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,500
and lost our lands.

169
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,450
How can I uphold authority if I don't kill him?

170
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,190
Prime Minister, as per your order,

171
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,030
Ma Su has been executed.

172
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,030
Give pension to Ma Su's family,

173
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:24,830
and provide them

174
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:26,870
with grain monthly.

175
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:28,810
Aye.

176
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,630
Generals,

177
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:41,730
as long as we can

178
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,540
defeat Zhang He,

179
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,660
Chang'an will be conquered.

180
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,620
And our Northern Expedition

181
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,300
will be successful.

182
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,860
Aye.

183
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,970
Ma Su didn't fulfill his mission.

184
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,260
(Chief of Staff to the Prime Minister, the Shu State)
(Yang Yi)

185
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:55,800
(Yang Yi)
Ma Su didn't fulfill his mission.

186
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:54,970
(Yang Yi)

187
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,620
He brought it on himself.
(Chief of Staff to the Prime Minister, the Shu State)
(Yang Yi)

188
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,420
(Chief of Staff to the Prime Minister, the Shu State)
(Yang Yi)

189
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,740
Prime Minister, why do you feel sorry for him?
(Chief of Staff to the Prime Minister, the Shu State)
(Yang Yi)

190
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,780
I'm not feeling sorry for him.

191
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,750
I just didn't expect that the Northern Expedition

192
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,380
would end up in failure.

193
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,210
Prime Minister,

194
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,340
though Ma Su should be held accountable

195
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,780
for losing the battle of Jieting,

196
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,030
Baidi's intelligence

197
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,420
was also false.

198
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,740
What I'm saying is

199
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,460
that there must be a Wei's spy

200
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,510
who has infiltrated into our key department.

201
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,090
We've got a mole

202
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,100
in our Siwencao Intelligence.

203
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,500
Investigate it.

204
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:04,870
Aye.

205
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,300
(Days later)
(Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

206
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:13,940
(Siwencao, the Intelligence Agency of Shu)

207
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:20,710
(Section Clerk of Siwencao, the Shu State)
(Feng Ying)

208
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,100
Are you sure about that?

209
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,810
The intelligence was written in codes.

210
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,650
The probability of being swapped is very small.

211
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,630
You mean

212
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,260
Baidi has something to do with it?

213
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,230
Or he might be set up by the Wei army.

214
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,020
Wei State

215
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,270
established their own Intelligence

216
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,500
which is just like our Siwencao Intelligence.

217
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,480
It's not subjected to the local governments.

218
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,050
It only reports to the Department of Imperial Secretariats headquartered in Yecheng.

219
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,670
Their job is

220
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,450
to plant moles in our state

221
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,310
and make false intelligence

222
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,980
to throw us off and mislead us.

223
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,310
My informant even told me

224
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,310
that a Wei spy has infiltrated into your Siwencao Intelligence.

225
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,500
We've carried out an internal investigation.

226
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,320
That's not good enough.

227
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,900
What happened exactly?

228
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,360
And which part went wrong?

229
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:10,950
Even the Prime Minister

230
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,700
asked about it.

231
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,060
Siwencao Intelligence dispatched another spy

232
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,450
to Tianshui

233
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,140
to ask Baidi about this matter.

234
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,530
There's no feedback yet.

235
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,560
I don't care about how you do it.

236
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,260
I only want results.

237
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,380
Chief Yang,

238
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,310
this matter

239
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,390
is a little complicated.

240
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,340
That's your problem, not mine.

241
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:33,930
Feng Ying,

242
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,100
you've got to find out what happened

243
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,440
to the intelligence regarding Jieting as soon as possible.

244
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,820
It's our priority.

245
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,740
The Prime Minister is under extreme pressure

246
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,070
due to the failure of the Northern Expedition.

247
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,100
And the two factions of Northern Expedition and south war hawks are in dispute.

248
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,180
Li Yan insists on invading Wu State in the south

249
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,300
to avenge the late King for being defeated by Lu Xun in Yiling.

250
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:57,840
I've also

251
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,060
heard about it.

252
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,960
General Li Yan is backed

253
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,310
by the two major clans in Jingzhou and Yizhou.

254
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,100
They all have their own selfish motives,

255
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,510
and they never take the Prime Minister's plan seriously.

256
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,620
I'll go back to Chengdu tomorrow with the Prime Minister.

257
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,820
Someone has to take responsibility

258
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,220
for the failure of the Northern Expedition.

259
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,140
The chaos in the Imperial Court

260
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,980
is inevitable.

261
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,020
I'm aware of that.

262
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,100
If Baidi has any update,

263
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,920
let me know immediately.

264
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,130
No need to walk me out.

265
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:35,260
(Tianshui)
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

266
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:40,510
(A Wei spy lurking in the Shu State)
(Lin Liang)

267
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:41,540
Sir,

268
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:42,740
how much

269
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,020
is this horse?

270
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,580
Niu's Tavern.

271
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,260
(Jinyuyao Brothel)
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

272
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,150
This time
(Jinyuyao Brothel)
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

273
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,850
(Jinyuyao Brothel)
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

274
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,150
we got lucky

275
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,800
to defeat the Shu army.

276
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,580
Governor, it was all because

277
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,060
Commander Guo Huai

278
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,220
and you

279
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,690
lured away the main force of the Shu army,

280
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,380
and put

281
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,320
Zhuge Liang's troops

282
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,620
in an impossible position.

283
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,020
I've told you many times.

284
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,870
Don't always call me Governor.

285
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,820
Just call me

286
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,820
Guo Gang when we are alone.

287
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,230
Say,

288
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,340
smart and cunning as Zhuge Liang is,

289
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,290
how could he walk into our trap?

290
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,460
No man is wise

291
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,830
at all times.

292
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:37,830
Not really.

293
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,420
Because

294
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:42,730
we have Zhulong.

295
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,060
Zhulong?

296
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,180
Zhang He's plan

297
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,310
of action has

298
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,640
been blabbed

299
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,540
ten days before he set off.

300
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:56,570
Who ratted on him?

301
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,350
A Shu spy,

302
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,620
Baidi.

303
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:07,660
Guo Gang.

304
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,060
Baidi...

305
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,780
Baidi is just a legend.

306
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,550
He's not.

307
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,910
It was Baidi

308
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,180
who stole

309
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,140
Zhang He's intelligence

310
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,860
regarding ambushing Shu army in Jieting.

311
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,110
And he sent the message to Shu army's battalion in Mount Qi overnight.

312
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,820
Since the Shu army got the message,

313
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,900
why didn't they prepare for it?

314
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,460
Because Zhulong swapped the message.

315
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,260
Zhulong is indeed

316
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,840
impressive, isn't he?

317
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,950
Zhulong used to

318
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,910
be the Commander's informant.

319
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,150
I have just taken it over recently.

320
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:43,920
I didn't expect

321
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,560
that he'd present me such a big gift.

322
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,180
Now I understand

323
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,870
why you are telling me

324
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,300
this confidential matter.

325
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,790
You want me to prepare reward money.

326
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:54,700
I need to think about it.

327
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:56,610
You insignificant Recorder.

328
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,630
Don't be so stingy,

329
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,630
alright?

330
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,020
Although we turned the table this time,

331
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,460
Baidi

332
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,470
is still our biggest concern.

333
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:12,900
They have Baidi,

334
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,190
but we have Zhulong.

335
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:14,990
What are you afraid of?

336
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,540
Zhulong sent us a message

337
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,980
that Siwencao Intelligence

338
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,380
has sent another spy,

339
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,020
who has arrived in Tianshui.

340
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:21,750
He came here

341
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,060
to ask Baidi

342
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,370
about the Jieting incident.

343
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:28,830
Then we need to be careful.

344
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,900
What if they find out about Zhulong?

345
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,180
Excuse me, where is Niu's Tavern?

346
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,490
Niu's Tavern

347
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,580
is right up front.

348
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,000
Zhulong is a deep undercover.

349
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,540
Nobody else but

350
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,550
the Commander and I

351
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,020
know who he really is.

352
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:52,140
It could be a perfect opportunity.

353
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,300
Opportunity of what?

354
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,880
Of catching Baidi.

355
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:15,620
Report.

356
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,190
The Shu spy went to the west.

357
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,050
To the direction of Yunxu Street.

358
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:22,100
(The Intelligence Agency of Wei)
(Chancellor of the Tianshui Military Intelligence Agency)
(Mi Chong)

359
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:18,540
(Mi Chong)
To the direction of Yunxu Street.

360
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:18,050
(Mi Chong)

361
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,130
Follow him,
(The Intelligence Agency of Wei)
(Chancellor of the Tianshui Military Intelligence Agency)
(Mi Chong)

362
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,190
and see to whom he talks.

363
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,030
Aye.

364
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,460
Go around him from ahead.

365
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:32,670
Keep a distance.

366
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:33,820
Aye.

367
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,170
Do you smell it?

368
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:41,570
It smells like meat.

369
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,220
Two hours, Chen Gong.

370
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,620
Give me two hours

371
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,670
and I'll put on a good show for you.

372
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,380
(Niu's Tavern)

373
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,290
(Liang Jian, Military Intelligence Agency of Wei in Tianshui)

374
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:03,850
Please.
(Liang Jian, Military Intelligence Agency of Wei in Tianshui)

375
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:11,839
Sir,

376
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,880
how many tables do you want to reserve?

377
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:15,670
Seven.

378
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,619
Raise the flower baskets

379
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,380
with two tones.

380
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:23,940
Eh?

381
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,700
Why did they stop? Why are they leaving?

382
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:28,860
Yunxu House just hired

383
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,980
two beauties from Dantu.

384
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,470
They are quite charming.

385
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:32,460
I'll introduce them to you.

386
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,340
But the Commander stressed many times

387
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,990
that we are not allowed

388
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,030
to bring prostitutes to the camp.

389
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,390
The Commander is your uncle.

390
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,620
Besides, if you catch Baidi

391
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,580
and make

392
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,940
a great contribution to our Wei,

393
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,940
there's nothing wrong

394
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,740
to celebrate it a little in advance.

395
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,100
Just this one time.

396
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,110
We won't do it again.

397
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:51,790
One time only.

398
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:52,750
We won't do it again.

399
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:54,100
Two-toned flower baskets.

400
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,450
(Jinyuyao)

401
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,310
Sir.

402
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:24,500
Where's the bathroom?

403
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:26,010
Out the door and turn to the east.

404
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,520
I'll be right back.

405
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:33,850
Check.

406
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,160
Here.

407
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:01,960
Sir,

408
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,110
please make way.

409
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:04,690
You need to come with us.

410
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:19,710
It's time.

411
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,910
Hey.

412
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,550
Go out at night holding a candle.

413
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,890
You should trust the veterans' words.

414
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,190
The show I'm going to let you see

415
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,380
is much more exciting than this.

416
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,340
Hurry. Hurry.

417
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:31,590
(Chengdu, the Shu State)

418
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,230
I'm just a mediocrity,

419
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,170
and yet I'm trusted with a high position

420
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,160
and the military power.

421
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,440
I'm the Commander of all troops,

422
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,820
but I failed in abiding by the rules.

423
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,230
And because of my indecisiveness,

424
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,060
(The King of Shu)
(Liu Chan)

425
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:47,990
Ma Su
(The King of Shu)
(Liu Chan)

426
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,540
(The King of Shu)
(Liu Chan)

427
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,010
disobeyed the military order and caused the failure of the battle.
(The King of Shu)
(Liu Chan)

428
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,260
disobeyed the military order and caused the failure of the battle.

429
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,640
I also failed in warning him in time.

430
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,200
It was all my fault

431
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,790
that I used the wrong person.

432
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:56,620
(General who assists Shu, the Shu State)
(Li Yan)

433
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,450
I
(General who assists Shu, the Shu State)
(Li Yan)

434
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:58,380
(General who assists Shu, the Shu State)
(Li Yan)

435
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:58,750
didn't pick the general wisely
(General who assists Shu, the Shu State)
(Li Yan)

436
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,540
didn't pick the general wisely

437
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,050
and I didn't plan well.

438
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,690
In the Spring and Autumn Annal it reads, "The Commander should be responsible for the failure of a battle."

439
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,290
And that's exactly the responsibility I should take.

440
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,230
I'm willing

441
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,390
to be demoted down three ranks

442
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,610
to make up for my mistake.

443
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,380
I feel

444
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:20,830
really sorry and guilty.

445
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,470
I deserve to be punished.

446
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,890
Please rise.

447
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,230
Thank you, Your Majesty.

448
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,380
Thank you, Your Majesty.

449
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,340
When it comes to battles, you can't win them all.

450
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,220
You don't have to blame yourself, Prime Minister.

451
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,540
He lost the battle.

452
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,030
He should be demoted.

453
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,540
It's only fair.

454
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,780
General, I think you are wrong.

455
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:52,300
I heard the Prime Minister invaded four counties

456
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,280
and conquered them all. That was quite impressive.

457
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,680
But then he lost them all.

458
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:59,640
How's that different from never conquering them?

459
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:04,190
It's said a country must be governed by the rule of laws.

460
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,510
If the laws are neglected,

461
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,420
the reign won't be convincing.

462
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,550
General Li is right.

463
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:18,900
The Chief Commander must be held accountable

464
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:21,110
for the failure of the Northern Expedition.

465
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,630
I should be

466
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:26,000
severely punished so the army can take this as a lesson.

467
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,220
The Prime Minister took his credit for granted,

468
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,770
and didn't care about our late King's grudge against Wu at all.

469
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,470
He recklessly

470
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,540
led an army of 100,000 soldiers to attack Wei.

471
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,890
I can't believe His Majesty took Li Yan's advice

472
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:05,090
and demoted you down to General of the Right and Acting Prime Minister.

473
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,770
I went to His Majesty

474
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,820
and asked him to demote me.

475
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,150
The punishment seems fair to me.

476
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,070
I'm afraid that Li Yan is up to something.

477
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,480
He wants to seize the military power.

478
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,940
His Majesty says in the edict

479
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,100
that I'll still be the one who commands the army.

480
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,240
Prime Minister,

481
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,840
you need to watch out for Li Yan.

482
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,260
Our state is in crisis, and there are too many uncertainties.

483
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,210
You need to look at the bigger picture.

484
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,230
Make nice for the sake of our state.

485
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,340
Remaining in peace will benefit both.

486
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:46,820
By the way,

487
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,620
how is the internal investigation

488
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:51,220
you mentioned last time going?

489
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:56,340
We are still working on it.

490
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,750
(Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

491
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:34,520
(Deputy Chief of the Internal Affairs Department of Siwencao, the Shu State)
(Xun Xu)

492
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,640
Have you thought it over?
(Deputy Chief of the Internal Affairs Department of Siwencao, the Shu State)
(Xun Xu)

493
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:40,550
(Deputy Chief of the Internal Affairs Department of Siwencao, the Shu State)
(Xun Xu)

494
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,570
I was telling the truth.

495
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,650
Say it again.

496
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:48,500
When Chen Gong was young,

497
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:53,320
he was fond of the art of divination.

498
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:57,300
He used to be a student of Li Yan, General who assists Shu.

499
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:00,190
You referred him to Siwencao Intelligence, didn't you?

500
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:01,700
Yes.

501
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:04,670
Chen Gong and I

502
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,340
are sworn brothers.

503
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,460
What else?

504
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,000
His wife Di Yue

505
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,860
is my cousin,

506
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,960
as well as an undercover agent I put in the field.

507
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:23,730
I planted her in Wuxian Sect

508
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,110
to take charge of the Internal Affairs Department,

509
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,640
collecting information

510
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,220
of different schools and sects.

511
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:34,420
Anyone else in the department knows about this?

512
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,100
She only reports to me.

513
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,390
No one else knows about this.

514
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,220
Go on.

515
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,420
That's...

516
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,920
That's all I know.

517
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,060
Help him remember.

518
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:17,890
I was the one who referred you to Siwencao Intelligence.

519
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,400
Who would've thought that you'd become my brother-in-law?

520
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,310
Hmm.

521
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,740
I do feel regret.

522
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,410
Why?

523
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:30,840
Once you become a spy, you'll be a spy forever.

524
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,550
You two spend very little time together.

525
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:35,710
It's not too hard for Yue.

526
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,110
Brother, what are you talking about?

527
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,940
Since Chen Gong married me,

528
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,420
he'll have to follow our way of life, right?

529
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,180
Hmm.

530
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:45,860
That's right.

531
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,190
Our Xun family and the Di family

532
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,900
have served the Zhuge family originated in Langya for over 100 years.

533
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,680
We've been doing undercover work for generations.

534
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,460
It's our mission.

535
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,880
If our families hadn't risked their lives to dig out information,

536
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:57,990
Prime Minister Zhuge

537
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,380
wouldn't have gained insight into world affairs

538
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,470
without leaving Longzhong.

539
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,580
Mind your words.

540
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,550
How dare you disrespect Prime Minister Zhuge?

541
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,500
I'm just stating the truth.

542
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,620
And now you and I are the only ones left.

543
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,940
You're taking care of me while working as a spy.

544
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,340
Don't forget me.

545
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,630
You still have me.

546
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,470
That's what I like to hear.

547
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,380
Please save those words to yourselves, okay?

548
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,120
Alright, let's drop it.

549
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:27,440
To the future of restoring the Han Dynasty.

550
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,430
What kind of future is it?

551
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,920
A future with no wars.

552
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,590
A future where people like us

553
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,380
can live a happy life.

554
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:42,140
Well said.

555
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,520
You still think

556
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,540
that Chen Gong hasn't turned on us?

557
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:12,270
Chen Gong would never turn on us.

558
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,320
Why are you so sure about him?

559
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,220
Because I have faith in him.

560
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,010
You are stubborn and inflexible.

561
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,410
But will you still be this unyielding

562
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,380
when bearing a heavy task?

563
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,600
What do you mean?

564
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:00,170
Siwencao has a mission for you.

565
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:04,210
Can you promise to serve with absolute loyalty?

566
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,870
I promise.

567
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,320
(Li Yan's Mansion)
(Chengdu, the Shu State)

568
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,550
General, you came back so late.

569
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,100
I met a few people.

570
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,220
They are all from

571
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,660
the wealthy clans in Yizhou.

572
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:38,770
They are not happy

573
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,930
about Zhuge Liang's despotism.

574
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,040
(Adjutant to the Military Commissioner, the Shu State)
(Hu Zhong)

575
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,230
About four hours ago,
(Adjutant to the Military Commissioner, the Shu State)
(Hu Zhong)

576
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:44,900
(Adjutant to the Military Commissioner, the Shu State)
(Hu Zhong)

577
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,760
Chief Yang Yi of the Prime Minister's Mansion visited.
(Adjutant to the Military Commissioner, the Shu State)
(Hu Zhong)

578
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,900
Chief Yang Yi of the Prime Minister's Mansion visited.

579
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:48,790
He said

580
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,140
that Prime Minister Zhuge

581
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,190
reported to His Majesty

582
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,020
and proposed that you be promoted

583
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,340
as Cavalry General,

584
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:57,790
and that eldest Young Master Li Feng replace you

585
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,220
to take charge of the defense of Jiangzhou.

586
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,620
What's that about?

587
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,180
Do I need that?

588
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,710
Yang Yi said

589
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,040
Prime Minister Zhuge had a short message,

590
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,490
"Make nice for the sake of our state.

591
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:14,830
Remaining in peace will benefit both."

592
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,580
I don't trust him.

593
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,170
You mentioned earlier

594
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,060
that a Wei spy infiltrated

595
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,860
into Siwencao Intelligence.

596
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,220
Has it been confirmed?

597
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,110
Siwencao was founded by Yang Yi.

598
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,980
It's hard to get inside information.

599
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,540
I don't believe

600
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,540
that there's nothing we can do.

601
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:40,980
Find a way

602
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,360
and dig deeper.

603
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:43,360
Aye.

604
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:51,510
So you've never

605
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:53,900
contacted Chen Gong again?

606
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,220
No.

607
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,220
Do you know where he is?

608
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:04,360
As the Deputy Chief of the Internal Affairs Department,

609
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,480
I'm well aware of the rules,

610
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,470
so I never asked.

611
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:10,590
Hmm.

612
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,900
I have some

613
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:16,610
information for you.

614
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,510
You may already know

615
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,420
that after Chen Gong left Nanzheng County,

616
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:26,620
he was dispatched to Wei

617
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:28,530
to serve

618
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,910
Guo Huai, the Vice Commander of the Wei Army.

619
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,220
He then was promoted to Commandant for his military exploit,

620
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,180
and was appointed as

621
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:37,710
the Recorder of Tianshui after that

622
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,900
to take care of the military supplies in the west of Wei.

623
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,820
He's actually

624
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:46,990
one of us.

625
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,300
His code name is Baidi.

626
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,630
Chen Gong is Baidi?

627
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,020
It's highly confidential.

628
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,010
We've been tailing the Shu spy

629
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:02,900
(The Military Intelligence Agency of Wei)
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

630
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:02,860
(Tianshui, the Wei State)
We've been tailing the Shu spy

631
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:01,010
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

632
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:03,950
as soon as he entered Tianshui.
(The Military Intelligence Agency of Wei)
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

633
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,060
as soon as he entered Tianshui.

634
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,840
He didn't know that he was being followed.

635
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,400
So

636
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:10,170
Zhulong's intelligence seems to be accurate.

637
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,140
We followed him all the way to Niu's Tavern.

638
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,540
We believed

639
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,850
that he'd meet

640
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,740
Baidi there.

641
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,760
But an accident happened unexpectedly.

642
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:23,620
Tell me, what happened?

643
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,390
-At that time... he
-I was there at that time.

644
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,510
The Shu spy suddenly attacked us.

645
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:28,710
We suspect

646
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,950
that someone tipped him off.

647
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:30,680
Yes.

648
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:31,900
Was I asking you?

649
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:35,550
Governor,

650
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,910
since the suspect

651
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:39,800
showed up,

652
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,420
which means

653
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,670
we have a lead now.

654
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,460
Have a lead...

655
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,400
I heard you.

656
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,700
I was going to put on a good show for you,

657
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,620
but they screwed up.

658
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,040
I owe you one then.

659
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,240
I think

660
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,320
Chancellor Mi was right.

661
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,120
If Baidi is in Tianshui,

662
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,740
he'll be caught sooner or later.

663
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:10,920
Be patient.

664
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,270
Hopefully.

665
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:14,560
By the way,

666
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,220
I had a good time today.

667
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,070
But the military affairs

668
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,260
have been keeping me busy lately.

669
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:21,280
When I'm free, please take me there again.

670
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,300
-You bet.
-Don't you go there alone.

671
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:24,410
I won't.

672
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:25,930
Alright, I'll take my leave then.

673
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:26,930
Don't worry. You take it.

674
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,210
The rain will stop soon.

675
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,090
I don't need it.

676
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,490
For all these years,

677
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,550
Chen Gong has been lurking in Wei

678
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,320
and sent back a lot

679
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,680
of valuable intelligence.

680
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:45,690
Prime Minister

681
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,820
personally led the troops to invade Wei

682
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,330
and got off to a good start.

683
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,300
Only Guangwei County and Longxi County

684
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,440
held out.

685
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,020
Wei's situation

686
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,560
was critical.

687
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,420
Zhang He was thus ordered

688
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,100
to lead an army of 100,000 soldiers

689
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,070
to

690
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,150
across Mount Long

691
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,380
from the Guanzhong region.

692
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,510
The question was

693
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,460
which road Zhang He

694
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,310
would take

695
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,670
to confront us.

696
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,580
It was of absolute confidentiality to the Wei army.

697
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:16,420
Just when the Prime Minister

698
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,870
couldn't decide what to do,

699
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:20,850
he received Baidi's intelligence.

700
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:22,530
Unfortunately,

701
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,790
it was misinformation.

702
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:29,310
As a result,

703
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:30,940
we lost Jieting Fortress,

704
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:33,100
and the Prime Minister Zhuge's

705
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:34,290
Northern Expedition plan

706
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:36,409
fell apart because of it.

707
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,620
So,

708
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,480
now you can be relieved, right?

709
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:41,800
No.

710
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,790
It only proves that he wasn't there,

711
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:50,190
but it doesn't mean that he has nothing to do with Baidi.

712
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,650
You asked me to lure him away,

713
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:58,250
I did it.

714
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,050
You asked me to make an example of him,

715
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:02,710
I did it, too.

716
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,680
With nothing to hide

717
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,260
and out in the open.

718
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,020
Why do you still suspect him?

719
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,280
Our military secret was stolen by a Shu spy.

720
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,470
Governor,

721
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,770
this is a major case.

722
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,740
Even so, we can't make groundless accusation.

723
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:21,720
Our Military Intelligence Agency has eliminated

724
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,600
all relevant higher-ups from investigation except Chen Gong.

725
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,920
Chen Gong is just a Recorder in Tianshui.

726
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,410
How could he know the military secret?

727
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,760
The Recorder is in charge of army provisions.

728
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,920
He can easily

729
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:35,070
tell our army's movements

730
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,100
from where the provisions go.

731
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,210
Isn't that a top secret?

732
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,180
This is groundless accusation.

733
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:42,390
There's another possibility.

734
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,000
Chen Gong's cover was blown,

735
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:48,060
and we were set up by the intelligence agency of Wei.

736
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,180
Don't be naive.

737
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,670
Chen Gong betrayed us.

738
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,180
One month ago,

739
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,110
I sent a spy to go to Tianshui

740
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,940
to investigate the Jieting's false intelligence case.

741
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,460
The Wei army

742
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,220
found out about him

743
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,140
and stabbed him to death in a tavern.

744
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,540
Only I

745
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,400
and Chen Gong

746
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,620
knew his arrival in Tianshui.

747
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:17,340
Ten days before our army set off,

748
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:19,590
the Commander's camp suddenly caught on fire.

749
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,520
And that was how the secret was stolen.

750
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,960
Because Chen Gong was right there.

751
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,710
You are out of your mind!

752
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:31,090
The Commander fell ill,

753
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,290
and I asked Chen Gong to bring him medicine regularly

754
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,340
to show my filial piety.

755
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,180
I sent him.

756
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,260
Are you also

757
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:44,530
suspecting me?

758
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:47,540
I dare not.

759
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,740
I think you do!

760
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,420
After the Commander's camp caught on fire,

761
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,020
all the people there stayed in for investigation.

762
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,820
Chen Gong wasn't set free until seven days later.

763
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:00,980
By then, Baidi

764
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,770
has long delivered the intelligence to Mount Qi.

765
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,530
If Chen Gong was Baidi,

766
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,920
how could he manage to deliver the message?

767
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:10,170
By flying?

768
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,940
Take off my armor!

769
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,580
Go away! Leave!

770
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,170
I want you to go to Tianshui.

771
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:31,550
You want me to go?

772
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,630
Yes, you.

773
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:33,780
Clerk Feng,

774
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,700
I've never worked in the field before.

775
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,220
And now it's your opportunity.

776
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,080
After you come back,

777
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,700
I'll make you the Chief

778
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,260
of Internal Affairs Department.

779
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,100
The interrogation earlier

780
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:48,550
was a test.

781
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,500
You are one who'll do whatever it takes

782
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,680
to finish your job as long as you make up your mind.

783
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:58,830
You value brotherhood.

784
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:00,680
But you also need to know

785
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,960
when it comes

786
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,180
to the interests of our state,

787
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:05,860
you should put

788
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,500
your brotherhood aside.

789
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,150
Don't argue with him

790
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,980
when you see him.

791
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:15,490
Try to find out

792
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,800
how much information he's leaked.

793
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,850
After he told you,

794
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,420
kill him right away.

795
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,590
Poison him first,

796
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:27,790
and then cut his throat.

797
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,060
Stop hesitating

798
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,460
and get ready to go.

799
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,360
And

800
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,100
there's also poison in the tea

801
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:45,660
you just drank.

802
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,160
You...

803
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,230
Come back in three months for the antidote.

804
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:56,100
Is this necessary?

805
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,660
It's the rule.

806
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,060
I have to do it.

807
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:14,300
(Chen Gong's Residence)
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

808
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,300
Sir, you are back.

809
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,470
Let's talk inside.

810
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,780
Did the people

811
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:35,820
from the agency see you?

812
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,340
Everything happened so fast today.

813
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,260
I didn't have time to confirm.

814
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:44,010
But more or less I might

815
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,540
leave some trace when warning the spy.

816
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,960
Fortunately, very few people know you.

817
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:50,790
Even if you were exposed,

818
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,510
they wouldn't be able to find out who you are.

819
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:54,710
It should be fine.

820
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,310
Then I'd better

821
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,060
stay in for a few days.

822
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:58,980
Hmm.

823
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,200
Have they started to suspect you?

824
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,850
Guo Gang still trusts me.

825
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,020
Gu Zheng wants to meet you.

826
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:21,550
I can't.

827
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,430
Send him a warning

828
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,020
and let him stay low.

829
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:28,100
Alright.

830
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,420
The situation is getting dire.

831
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:34,060
The Intelligence Agency

832
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,020
wouldn't stop investigating Baidi.

833
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:43,010
Sir, is there anything else bothering you?

834
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,260
In today's case analysis meeting,

835
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:49,470
Mi Chong said

836
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:53,280
the intelligence of another Shu spy being sent

837
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:57,070
was provided by an undercover agent named Zhulong.

838
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:58,270
Zhulong?

839
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:03,770
Guo Gang told me in person today

840
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,490
that our army lost the battle in Jieting

841
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,230
because the intelligence I sent

842
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,270
was swapped.

843
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,290
I bet it was Zhulong

844
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:16,710
who did it.

845
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,620
What?

846
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:20,850
How could that be possible?

847
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,380
Siwencao would never believe

848
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,340
that the intelligence was swapped.

849
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,140
It's most likely

850
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,420
that they'd think

851
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,020
I sent false intelligence to begin with.

852
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:34,430
That's why they sent

853
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,310
another spy

854
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,780
to investigate me, the suspect.

855
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,470
But the other spy is dead.

856
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,300
They'll suspect you even more now.

857
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,080
The Military Intelligence Agency of Wei

858
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,500
has been investigating Baidi,

859
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,900
and Siwencao

860
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:58,950
has mistaken me for a traitor.

861
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,920
If they both are coming for you, then you...

862
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,690
But given that you are so devoted to our Shu,

863
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,380
you can always explain it

864
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:12,690
if there's a misunderstanding.

865
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,520
My biggest concern for now

866
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:18,210
is that a Wei spy

867
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,540
has infiltrated into the heart of Siwencao Intelligence.

868
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,480
My reporting line is not safe anymore.

869
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:27,890
We have to figure out a way as soon

870
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,610
as possible

871
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:34,430
to let Siwencao know the existence of Zhulong.

872
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,050
But...

873
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:47,500
how?

874
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,350
how?

875
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,420
Something big has happened.

876
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:17,090
I don't think you know about it.

877
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:18,620
Come with me.

878
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:22,030
(The 24 Strategies of War, The Wind Blows from Longxi)
(Intelligence Agency in Longxi)

879
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:24,310
(The First Strategy)
(Replace the Beams with Rotten Timbers)

880
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:29,060
The wind has risen in the Shu State.

881
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:30,670
The battle of Jieting was lost

882
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:31,690
Ma Su was beheaded.

883
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:32,920
All this was triggered by

884
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:33,750
the replacement of

885
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:36,410
intelligence on the Battle of Jieting.

886
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:39,310
According to Chen Gong,

887
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,310
a spy with the code name Zhulong

888
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:43,540
has infiltrated into the Shu State.

889
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,980
Zhulong replaced the message

890
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:47,620
and achieved a double effect.

891
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:50,900
Jieting's false intelligence case led the failure of the Northern Expedition.

892
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:53,620
Prime Minister Zhuge, the pillar of Shu,

893
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:55,350
was also punished because of this.

894
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:57,630
The situation in Shu is in chaos.

895
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,760
Shu's intelligence agency, Siwencao,

896
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:03,030
also sensed the signs of a huge change.

897
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:06,820
Clerk Feng, in order to find out whether Baidi

898
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,870
had betrayed them, tested Xun Xu with torture

899
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:11,660
and made him confess his relationship with Chen Gong.

900
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:13,820
Chen Gong and I

901
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,500
are sworn brothers.

902
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,580
Xun Xu passed the test

903
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:21,170
and showed his loyalty and determination to find out the truth.

904
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,550
Clerk Feng sent him to the field to kill Baidi.

905
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,800
Who is Clerk Feng?

906
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,200
His name is Feng Ying.

907
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:33,580
He is the boss in charge of intelligence work,

908
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,200
and he is also my brother-in-law.

909
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:37,660
Is this something I can say?

910
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:40,060
I think I can.

911
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:41,660
But, my dear Feng Ying,

912
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,460
Xun Xu and Baidi

913
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:45,500
are like brothers.

914
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,780
We can't turn two brothers

915
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:48,300
against each other.

916
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,280
This time,

917
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:50,790
will Baidi find out

918
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:52,970
the secret behind

919
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,280
the false intelligence case?

920
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,860
Will Xun Xu

921
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:58,330
kill his good friend Baidi?

922
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,350
Everyone,

923
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:05,230
please wait for my next exclusive information.
