3
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,330
Xun Xu, if you think I'm a Wei spy,

4
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,670
arrest me.

5
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,060
I'm exhausted, too.

6
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,060
I want to stop for a breath.

7
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,970
Everybody has to do something not out of his free will.

8
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,440
There are few people

9
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:22,780
like you and me.

10
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,750
Miss Liu, do you remember

11
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,610
that you gave me a bamboo flute?

12
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:33,940
I promised you

13
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,740
that I would always bring it with me.

14
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,290
It's my treasure.

15
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,270
But I've never given you anything in return.

16
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,010
With this token,

17
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,610
you can leave the town at any time.

18
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,740
I only beg you

19
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,640
to leave this dangerous place.

20
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,540
I hope

21
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:27,500
you will take care.

22
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:09,440
Chief Xun.

23
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,600
Chief Xun,

24
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:14,930
Lin Liang is very near.

25
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,100
Shall I ask him to follow her?

26
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:16,890
There's no need.

27
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,380
Shall I follow her personally?

28
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,399
I said, there's no need.

29
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,350
Don't

30
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,600
tell Chen Gong about it.

31
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,440
Fine.

32
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,400
Clerk Feng, I'm honored

33
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,150
by your gracious presence.

34
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,750
You invited me and I would come.

35
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,220
This is the new tea

36
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:46,850
of this year.

37
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,880
Please have a taste.

38
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,170
Good.

39
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:54,690
Nice tea.

40
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,340
When I was young,

41
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,220
I was quite busy

42
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,940
and all I cared about was

43
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,960
making contributions.

44
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,040
When I'm in my forties,

45
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,420
I get to understand

46
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,200
how great it is to be idle.

47
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:11,530
Clerk Feng,

48
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,830
you laid a strong foundation for Siwencao Intelligence.

49
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:17,820
There is no question

50
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,740
about your distinguished services.

51
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:21,900
Chen Gong,

52
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:22,980
you flatter me.

53
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,740
I don't.

54
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,170
Others may not be aware.

55
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,530
But I know it very well.

56
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,020
When Siwencao Intelligence

57
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,810
was first founded,

58
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,380
there were great hardships.

59
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,550
It was indeed you

60
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:41,180
who

61
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,970
spared no pains

62
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,820
to have created an unprecedented era

63
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:45,659
for battles

64
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,510
between agencies and spies.

65
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,540
Marvelous.

66
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,060
Keep this

67
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,330
between us

68
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,330
just for fun.

69
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,180
Don't say this in front of strangers.

70
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,060
When I was in Tianshui,

71
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,340
I gradually

72
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,040
gained trust from the Wei Army

73
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,990
so that I had access to the Document Chamber.

74
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,020
I checked

75
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,700
some documents.

76
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,990
It's clearly recorded

77
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,010
that you foretold things accurately in the past dozen of years

78
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,180
and gained the upper hand

79
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:19,370
in intelligence fights so many times

80
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,060
that the Wei Army failed to defend themselves.

81
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,700
So,

82
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,340
every time Guo Gang and Guo Huai speak of you,

83
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,060
they keep praising you

84
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,500
with a sense of awe for you.

85
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,060
They do?

86
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,210
What do they say about me?

87
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,700
They say you're extremely cunning

88
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,620
and vicious.

89
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,740
I don't deserve

90
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,100
such a serious comment.

91
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,540
The more vicious you are to Wei,

92
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,570
the more loyal you are to our state.

93
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,060
Clerk Feng,

94
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,570
when your enemies think so highly of you,

95
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,940
don't you feel proud?

96
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,590
Chen Gong, I think

97
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,140
you're suggesting something else.

98
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,850
I do have some confusion

99
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,850
that I want you

100
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,820
to enlighten me.

101
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:20,300
You flatter me.

102
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,660
The confusion you have

103
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,470
must be very serious.

104
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,230
I'm not sure

105
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,350
if I can help you out.

106
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,250
You can.

107
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,730
Because it was you

108
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,140
who did that thing.

109
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,659
Even if it happened a long time ago,

110
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:40,740
I don't think you would forget it.

111
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,140
Tell me about it, then.

112
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,500
In 218 A.D.,

113
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,740
General Li Yan garrisoned Zizhong County.

114
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:05,690
Instigated by Wei, Ma Qin and Gao Sheng rebelled.

115
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,560
They attacked Zizhong County with an army of tens of thousands of soldiers.

116
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,940
Unfortunately,

117
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,000
the number of enemies was gigantic,

118
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,020
but they couldn’t use tactics.

119
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,700
With fewer soldiers,

120
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,690
General Li Yan still gained the upper hand.

121
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,580
I remember this.

122
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,460
But it happened ten years ago.

123
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,220
I don't remember too much

124
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,540
about the details.

125
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,530
I don't need the details.

126
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,500
Just tell me

127
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:34,669
the rough outline.

128
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:37,640
Chen Gong,

129
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:39,820
what confuses you?

130
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,100
The rebel soldiers

131
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,700
failed many times.

132
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,460
But suddenly, as if God helped them,

133
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,820
they were thoroughly familiar

134
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,860
with the condition of our army.

135
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,100
First, they cut off the food route to Zizhong County.

136
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,110
Then,

137
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,250
a large army broke in.

138
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,610
I don't want to sit and do nothing.

139
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,330
I'd like to pioneer

140
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:06,660
and fight a way out

141
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,220
for you, General.

142
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,530
Once Zizhong County fell,

143
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,140
the rebel army would approach Chengdu.

144
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,460
As I remember,

145
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,510
to conquer the Hanzhong region,

146
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,180
the armies were kept within Yangping Pass

147
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,230
by the late emperor.

148
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,780
So, they couldn't go to Zizhong County for help.

149
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,060
General Li Yan was so unprepared

150
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,410
that he had no choice,

151
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,290
but to abandon the county and flee.

152
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,690
At that time, you were in Chengdu,

153
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,660
handling the military movements.

154
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,810
I guess

155
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,570
you know something.

156
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,540
Indeed.

157
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:50,940
I know something.

158
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,420
Then why?

159
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,420
Why?

160
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,220
Chen Gong,

161
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:06,920
I know what you mean

162
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,300
by asking this question.

163
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,420
When Chief Yang and I sent you to Wei,

164
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,380
I knew this day would come.

165
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,540
You did?

166
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,660
Your father Chen Fu

167
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,420
died in the battle of Zizhong County.

168
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,180
You're asking me

169
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,970
for justice.

170
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:33,940
If you say so,

171
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,330
Clerk Feng,

172
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,210
are you admitting the injustice you did?

173
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,660
I...

174
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,020
How shall I put it?

175
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,980
We can't

176
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,340
predict something when it begins.

177
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,060
Just like Di Yue.

178
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,900
When you first infiltrated Wuxian Sect,

179
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,090
you didn't know Di Yue would die.

180
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,730
All you knew was to complete your mission.

181
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,130
Am I right?

182
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,390
At that time,

183
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,300
letting the rebel army besiege Zizhong County

184
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,790
was a necessary step in our strategy.

185
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,540
What are you talking about?

186
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,860
The late emperor with his generals was confronting Xiahou Yuan

187
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,210
across the river at Yangping Pass.

188
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,420
Xiahou Yuan was

189
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,100
a genius general.

190
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,610
He had his place heavily guarded

191
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,080
and we failed

192
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,340
to infiltrate his army.

193
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,060
Just at that time,

194
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,420
instigated by Guo Huai,

195
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,180
Ma Qin and Gao Sheng rebelled.

196
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,530
Yang Yi

197
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,000
sent a very urgent secret edict

198
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,910
from the late emperor.

199
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:05,740
I was asked

200
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,420
to secretly offer the military condition

201
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,950
of Zizhong County to the Wei Army.

202
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:23,730
After Ma Qin and Gao Sheng

203
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,770
rebelled in Zizhong County,

204
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,360
the Wei Army on Mount Dingjun

205
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,250
misjudged as we expected

206
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,680
and attacked us rashly.

207
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,820
They fell into the Prime Minister's trap.

208
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,190
Xiahou Yuan

209
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,690
was killed in the battle by our army.

210
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,120
Then,

211
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,360
our army conquered the Hanzhong region.

212
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:20,770
I don't believe it.

213
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,530
I just don't.

214
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,260
I don't care

215
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:29,680
if you believe it or not.

216
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,150
This is just the truth.

217
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,420
Spy games are

218
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,540
full of deceptions.

219
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,540
Your father Chen Fu died in the war.

220
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,730
It was also unexpected.

221
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,830
I took the order from the late emperor.

222
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,940
I didn't fake anything.

223
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,940
I can swear to God.

224
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,830
(Ziyan House in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

225
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:14,050
(Ma Dai, General Who Pacifies the North of Shu)

226
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,290
General Ma Dai.

227
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,640
Hu Zhong,

228
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:48,820
why can't I see

229
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,340
too many people here today?

230
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,720
General Li Yan is holding a private dinner.

231
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,440
Anyone irrelevant must stay away.

232
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,450
Why didn't you tell me

233
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,580
when we were back in the Agency?

234
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,500
It was a last-minute decision of General Li Yan.

235
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,100
I only found out about this now.

236
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,140
I hear there was a military emergency?

237
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:10,970
After receiving the edict from His Majesty,

238
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,820
General couldn't fall asleep.

239
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,940
He keeps thinking it over

240
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,570
in case he misses something

241
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,380
and let down

242
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:18,830
His Majesty.

243
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,260
The defense of Mount Dingjun is virtually impregnable.

244
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,910
General Li Yan can rest assured.

245
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,620
General Ma Dai,

246
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,380
your sword, please.

247
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:39,840
Come in, please.

248
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,540
Greetings, General.

249
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,460
General Ma Dai,

250
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,460
my friend.

251
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,060
Don't stand on ceremony.

252
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,380
Be seated.

253
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,970
Prime Minister starts the second Northern Expedition with 200 thousand soldiers.

254
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,140
Ma Dai,

255
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:07,810
you must be stressed out.

256
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:10,060
General,

257
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,040
the local granary is always equipped

258
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,490
by the standard.

259
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,170
Excluding the wheat after this autumn,

260
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,190
the grain reserve is sufficient for one year.

261
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,010
Under the command of His Majesty,

262
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,040
I have to coordinate the logistics.

263
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,100
Ma Dai,

264
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,630
hope you'll help me with it.

265
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,940
This is my duty.

266
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,940
I'm at your command, General.

267
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,300
Cheers, General.

268
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,480
Hu Zhong is my henchman.

269
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,240
He's worked for me for over a decade.

270
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,260
This time, I want to transfer him

271
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,540
and let him

272
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:51,950
be your assistant

273
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,310
for more experience.

274
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,100
What do you think?

275
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:57,420
Good idea.

276
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,070
If Hu Zhong stays

277
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,340
on Mount Dingjun,

278
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,020
he'll be a great helper.

279
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,060
Thank you for your patronage, General Ma Dai.

280
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,420
You're welcome, Hu Zhong.

281
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,700
General Ma,

282
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,490
what's your opinion about the dispute between the Northern

283
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:14,700
and Southern Expeditions?

284
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,020
General,

285
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,619
I'm a soldier.

286
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,500
A soldier

287
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,420
is bound to take orders.

288
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:27,869
Absolutely right.

289
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,020
But today,

290
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:33,940
we're having a private dinner.

291
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:36,800
You can

292
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,310
make your points.

293
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,650
Umm...

294
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,260
Jieting's failure happened

295
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,960
not a long time ago.

296
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,740
Again,

297
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:54,330
the Prime Minister overrode all objections

298
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,660
and stuck to his own plan.

299
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,090
He will fight the Wei Army

300
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,060
with all the soldiers we have.

301
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,390
If he fails,

302
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,900
we will suffer heavy casualties

303
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,500
and the national strength will be wasted.

304
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,050
Even though

305
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,590
he can win

306
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,490
by good luck,

307
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,790
the war will last for a long time

308
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,820
with a sheer waste of energy and money.

309
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,500
At present,

310
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,980
with existing human and material resources,

311
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,300
it's already hard to defend the properties

312
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,700
of the late emperor.

313
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,280
When the Prime Minister

314
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,300
remains warlike,

315
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,100
it is never

316
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,070
a good thing for our state.

317
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,220
General Li Yan,

318
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,740
the Northern and Southern Expeditions

319
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,050
both sound reasonable.

320
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,060
As a mere soldier,

321
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,980
all I can do is to strain every nerve

322
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,260
to repay His Majesty

323
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,080
for his patronage.

324
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,410
As for

325
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,620
the result of the war,

326
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,660
it is

327
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,140
out of my consideration.

328
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:15,680
Chen Gong,

329
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,900
the tea tastes great.

330
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,250
I just got to enjoy it.

331
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:22,650
You colluded

332
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,100
with Guo Huai,

333
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,540
sold the secret of Siwencao Intelligence,

334
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,940
and sacrificed fieldwork spies.

335
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:29,740
Were you also ordered to do that?

336
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,510
Yes, of course.

337
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,260
Am I a man

338
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,730
who betrays his state

339
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,300
for small profits?

340
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:47,730
Chief Yang will arrive in Nanzheng County with the army.

341
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,360
If you don't believe me,

342
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,130
seek confirmation from him.

343
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:52,910
I will.

344
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,050
Clerk Feng,

345
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,030
even if it's true,

346
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,320
should my father

347
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:01,910
and countless fieldwork spies

348
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:04,430
just get killed

349
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,380
for the national cause?

350
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,800
Should they?

351
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,290
No one deserves to be killed.

352
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,620
But between state interests

353
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,850
and personal lives,

354
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,250
I pick the former.

355
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:25,630
I firmly

356
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,390
believe this.

357
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,990
Chen Gong,

358
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,890
we've paid a huge price for this.

359
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,860
We must in no way waste the efforts already made.

360
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:45,710
Chen Gong,

361
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,180
please don't be my enemy

362
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,720
for what happened before.

363
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,360
Don't overthink, Clerk Feng.

364
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,920
I also care

365
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,690
about the national cause.

366
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,370
Gao Tangbing's suicide...

367
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,600
I arranged it.

368
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,030
Don't bother to ask anymore.

369
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,400
Remember,

370
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,580
you have nothing to do with this case.

371
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,780
Xun Xu is investigating you.

372
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,680
It doesn't matter.

373
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:48,840
Chen Gong,

374
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,220
go visit Chief Yang

375
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,060
and try to get a General's Token

376
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,560
of the Prime Minister's Mansion.

377
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,060
When drinking,

378
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,850
let's not talk about politics.

379
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,330
General Ma Dai,

380
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,860
you are conscientious and loyal.

381
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,460
You're indeed a model for soldiers.

382
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,490
Thank you, Hu Zhong.

383
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,410
The late emperor

384
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,420
entrusted His Majesty to me.

385
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,650
Before the late emperor

386
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,410
passed away

387
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:31,380
in Baidi City,

388
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,420
he summoned me secretly.

389
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,940
He urged

390
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,050
that if the Prime Minister wanted to betray His Majesty,

391
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,940
we should be prepared.

392
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,640
Your elder brother Ma Chao

393
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,420
used to be my close friend

394
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,980
before he died.

395
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,200
On this matter,

396
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,190
we had a few discussions.

397
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,940
He also agreed

398
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,500
with the late emperor.

399
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:05,870
General Li Yan,

400
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,940
I'm too humble

401
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,860
to talk

402
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,430
about politics.

403
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,800
You don't believe me?

404
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,570
General,

405
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,360
my brother has been dead for six years.

406
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,420
And I've never heard

407
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:21,950
about this.

408
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:24,490
Please forgive me.

409
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:28,980
Very well.

410
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:30,820
Off you go.

411
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:35,760
General Hu Zhong,

412
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,250
my sword, please.

413
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,160
General,

414
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,020
do you not want me

415
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,590
to leave this room?

416
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,190
It depends on

417
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,220
whether you'll change your mind.

418
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:16,940
General Li Yan,

419
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,460
I've made up my mind.

420
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,500
As for the fight for power,

421
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:23,410
you'd better

422
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,230
think more about it.

423
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:29,210
Wait, General.

424
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:33,020
Ma Dai, if General Li Yan has a secret edict,

425
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,420
will you still stick to your decision?

426
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:36,520
A secret edict?

427
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:38,780
General,

428
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,990
General Ma Dai is very upright.

429
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,650
We couldn't persuade him without the secret edict from His Majesty.

430
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:11,130
General Ma Dai, read the edict, please.

431
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,650
General Li Yan,

432
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,360
I was speaking

433
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,860
too rudely.

434
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,290
General,

435
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,990
please forgive me.

436
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,900
General Ma Dai,

437
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,550
will you fight the rebel army by the edict?

438
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,110
Now that you have the edict,

439
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,320
I will do anything I can

440
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,830
and shrink from no sacrifice.

441
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:55,860
Give him the affidavit.

442
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:16,300
Oh, I understand.

443
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,950
With the help of so many generals,

444
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:21,060
you'll enjoy popular confidence.

445
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,960
You don't need to worry about anything.

446
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,090
Let General Ma Dai

447
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,850
make his cross on it.

448
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,510
I...

449
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,300
I will.

450
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,540
Come on.

451
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:53,190
Let's make a toast

452
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,740
to General Ma Dai's joining us.

453
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:58,680
Thank you, General.

454
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:21,670
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

455
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,380
Inspector Guo, Governor Guo,

456
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,180
Zhuge Liang left Chengdu and entered the Hanzhong region

457
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:31,910
with the main force.

458
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,810
Wei Yan and his army are the vanguards.

459
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,300
They ride along Qinling Mountains,

460
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:36,400
towards

461
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,880
Wudu

462
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,060
and Yinping.

463
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:42,580
They're fast.

464
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:44,850
Scouts have found out

465
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:46,970
that a secret army is moving stealthily

466
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:50,450
towards Jianwei in the south of Mount Qi.

467
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,300
How many soldiers?

468
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,190
We're not sure yet.

469
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,830
About 30,000 soldiers.

470
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,650
What job are you doing?

471
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,390
Which one is exactly the main force of the Shu Army?

472
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,980
I'll go check it out.

473
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:01,560
Go.

474
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,220
Aye.

475
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:07,140
The Shu Army is attacking us

476
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,530
in a weird way.

477
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,860
I'll temporarily give up Wudu and Yinping

478
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,180
and return to Mount Qi Base Camp.

479
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,260
We shall strictly defend Shanggui

480
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,340
and Tianshui.

481
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,620
If we lose two towns before a war,

482
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,720
I'm afraid we can hardly explain.

483
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:22,540
When the Wu and Shu armies invade at the same time,

484
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,740
our army isn’t strong enough to defend separately.

485
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,630
Concentrated forces will do better in counterattack.

486
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,000
Generals, at my command.

487
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,120
-Here.
-Here.

488
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:34,070
Strike all camps in Tianshui within three days.

489
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,130
Embattle along the Weishui River

490
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,700
and launch a frontal attack on the Shu Army.

491
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:37,840
Aye.

492
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,060
Chief Xun,

493
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:45,990
you're getting much better.

494
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:48,650
I'm still disabled.

495
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,910
Be contented, Chief Xun.

496
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,500
According to the physician,

497
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,720
only one out of ten men who are as badly wounded as you

498
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,740
could stand up again.

499
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,100
How do you feel today?

500
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,230
Clerk Chen.

501
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,220
I feel much better.

502
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,140
I can walk a few steps without the cane.

503
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:07,660
Good.

504
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:10,910
Be seated.

505
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,020
Be careful.

506
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,980
Slow. Slow.

507
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,290
All right.

508
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,340
You saw Miss Liu Ying today.

509
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,490
How did you feel?

510
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,860
We took the move.

511
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,060
Let's wait and see.

512
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,020
Lin Liang is keeping an eye on her.

513
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,210
He'll report to us if anything happens.

514
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,720
What about Feng Ying?

515
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:42,460
We have him spied on, too.

516
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,190
Nothing seems to be unusual.

517
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:46,220
However,

518
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,410
at noon yesterday,

519
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,490
someone drew a little circle on his door

520
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:52,030
with carbon dust.

521
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,320
Circle?

522
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,160
Yes, a very small circle.

523
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,040
If he hadn't wiped it off deliberately,

524
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:01,350
I wouldn't have noticed it.

525
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:02,700
Chen Gong,

526
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,230
this is a usual contact way of spies.

527
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:08,330
Do you still think he's clear?

528
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,730
I find something fishy today.

529
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,000
What is it?

530
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,520
He asked Sun Ling to arrange a trip

531
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:18,310
to Mount Chiyan of Qingshi Valley.

532
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:19,920
Qingshi Valley?

533
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:21,900
Why does he want to go there?

534
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:24,900
To have divination from a Taoist.

535
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,430
When will he go?

536
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,990
Early tomorrow morning.

537
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,290
I guess he won't arrive there

538
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,650
until nine o'clock.

539
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,810
The Prime Minister's army will be arriving tomorrow.

540
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:36,290
Everyone is busy with work.

541
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:38,820
Why does he want divination at this time?

542
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:40,630
According to him,

543
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,360
a lot of things have happened lately

544
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,190
and he wants to divine

545
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,600
if anything has gone wrong.

546
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:45,380
Nonsense!

547
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,750
If Feng Ying does anything fishy,

548
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,770
take drastic action.

549
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,500
Unfortunately,

550
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,180
I'm a mere chief of the Internal Affairs Department.

551
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,720
I don't think I can take him down.

552
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:01,880
Anyway,

553
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,210
we can't count on General Li Yan.

554
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:09,150
Feng Ying is already

555
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,210
his henchman.

556
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:14,100
What do we do, then?

557
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,690
Xun Xu, you mentioned it before.

558
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,610
So, I visited

559
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:24,170
Chief Yang

560
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,350
and got this.

561
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,550
General's Token of the Prime Minister’s Mansion.

562
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,890
This is great.

563
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:40,240
(Xixiang, the Shu State)

564
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,140
Welcome, Leader Huang.

565
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,520
Welcome, Leader Huang.

566
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:05,900
Thank you, everybody.

567
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,480
This time I'm back

568
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:11,410
because Zhuge Liang is fighting against Wei with his main forces.

569
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,260
It's the time

570
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:15,700
to revive our sect.

571
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:16,940
Leader, issue an order.

572
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,740
To revive our sect,

573
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,410
I'm willing to take any risk

574
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,350
and shrink from no sacrifice!

575
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,960
We'll shrink from no sacrifice!

576
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,760
We've been waiting for a long while.

577
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,500
This is the day we're expecting!

578
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:34,760
Good.

579
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:38,010
Our sect is

580
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,520
the vanguard of the Wei Army

581
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,750
to destroy Shu and Wu.

582
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:45,860
Guo Huai sent me to the Hanzhong region

583
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:47,790
for two missions.

584
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,400
Tell me.

585
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,890
How many members

586
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,120
can we still gather from different towns?

587
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,640
Two or three thousand.

588
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,990
They're at your command.

589
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,430
Take two elders from the sub-bases

590
00:32:58,980 --> 00:32:59,890
to gather our members

591
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,860
and sneak to the north of Sanguan Pass.

592
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,980
Get ready to cut off the food route of the Shu Army.

593
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,000
Aye.

594
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:07,810
Elder Cao.

595
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:08,540
Here.

596
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,880
Go with Guan Qi

597
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,780
to attack the pass outside Xixiang Town.

598
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,540
Outside Xixiang Town?

599
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,820
Isn't that the frontline battlefield?

600
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,500
It's just camouflage,

601
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:27,540
for Xun Xu of Siwencao Intelligence.

602
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,440
Aye.

603
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,739
Feng Ying.

604
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,840
I haven't

605
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,160
fought the enemies ever since.

606
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,340
You used to protect me all the time.

607
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,080
Feng Ying,

608
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:38,870
I've confirmed everything for tomorrow.

609
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:41,210
Taoist Qingyun isn't out for traveling.

610
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:44,580
Good, then.

611
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:45,770
Tomorrow,

612
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:46,820
we'll go there early in the morning.

613
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,820
The Prime Minister has left Chengdu.

614
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,030
He'll be arriving in Nanzheng County at three in the afternoon.

615
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:55,010
If you go to Mount Qingyun,

616
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:57,340
I don't think you can return in time.

617
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:59,040
Don't bother about this.

618
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,100
Just do what I told you.

619
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,110
Fine.

620
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,930
Go to bed early,

621
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:04,640
Feng Ying.

622
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:10,580
Wait, Sun Ling.

623
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:11,960
Mm?

624
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,450
Go to bed early, too.

625
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:24,270
Mm.

626
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:43,140
(Qingyun Hall in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

627
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:29,220
We asked to meet Taoist Qingyun the day before yesterday.

628
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,180
Please inform him.

629
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:32,550
He's been waiting for you.

630
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,230
Come in, please.

631
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:38,520
This is the fee for the divination.

632
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:40,900
This way, please.

633
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:48,470
Chief Xun,

634
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,120
everything is ready in there.

635
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,590
Shall we arrest him now?

636
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,140
There's no hurry.

637
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:54,940
Let's wait until he comes out.

638
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:02,860
Chief Xun,

639
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:04,740
look.

640
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,670
Have someone follow him. Hurry.

641
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:13,660
Go.

642
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,170
Aye.

643
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,750
Keep a close eye on him.

644
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:26,940
So, you're an official.

645
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,290
I'm not wearing a uniform.

646
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,390
How do you know that?

647
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:35,370
The environment tempers people.

648
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:38,280
After being an official for more than twenty years,

649
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,580
you have official airs.

650
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:42,850
Don't you realize that?

651
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,180
Oh, I see.

652
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,140
I was being ignorant.

653
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:54,570
May I ask

654
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,420
what the divination is?

655
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:04,590
Does anything make you hesitate?

656
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:09,840
If you don't mind,

657
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,330
I'll get to the point.

658
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,650
I don't mind.

659
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,190
I'm all ears.

660
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,460
Within three days,

661
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,880
you will be in prison.

662
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:25,680
Nonsense!

663
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,610
Do you know who he is?

664
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,020
Don't be rude.

665
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:33,810
You sound optimistic.

666
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,340
You must be fearless of death.

667
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,830
Though a man's life is destined,

668
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:44,150
I still wonder

669
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:45,910
if I can get out of trouble.

670
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:49,130
As an old saying goes,

671
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:52,540
a man has to sacrifice something to get what he wants.

672
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:58,940
In this case,

673
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,920
nothing can help me out.

674
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:15,280
Nonsense!

675
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:16,860
What a bad Taoist he is!

676
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,580
This is my fate.

677
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,600
Why bother cursing him?

678
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,210
He's ridiculous.

679
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,690
He spoilt your mood.

680
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:27,890
I'll have some guards

681
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,670
break down his house.

682
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,430
He talked nonsense and made trouble.

683
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:33,570
That is unforgivable!

684
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,670
Don't monkey around.

685
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,790
We had wanted a good omen.

686
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,050
Unexpectedly, we got something disgusting.

687
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,300
-What the heck!
-Stop!

688
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:49,200
This is Clerk Feng Ying of Siwencao Intelligence.

689
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,160
Who are you?

690
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,300
Xun Xu?

691
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,170
What are you doing?

692
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,520
Clerk Feng,

693
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:05,360
you colluded with the Wei Army

694
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,070
and divulged our military secrets.

695
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:08,870
You're under arrest.

696
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,610
(Intelligence Agency in Longxi)
(The 24 Strategies of War, The Wind Blows from Longxi)

697
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:17,010
(The Twentieth Strategy Rescue the Main Force by Sacrificing the Other)

698
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:19,790
Something big happened.

699
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,410
Miss Liu Ying is involved

700
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:24,220
in the intelligence fight, too.

701
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:25,850
But Xun Xu

702
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:27,040
didn't want to blow her cover.

703
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,040
He even gave her a token,

704
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,210
asking her to leave this dangerous place.

705
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,060
Chen Gong

706
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,820
finally laid his cards to Feng Ying.

707
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:37,180
In 218 A.D.,

708
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:38,700
to defeat the Wei Army,

709
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,660
Prime Minister Zhuge

710
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:41,980
used the military information of Zizhong County

711
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:42,980
to divert their attention

712
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,860
from the battlefield at Yangping Pass

713
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,460
and misled them.

714
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:47,980
Finally,

715
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:49,180
our army won.

716
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:50,500
I'm bound to say

717
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:52,170
that Prime Minister Zhuge used a brilliant trick

718
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,320
to rescue the main force

719
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:54,490
by sacrificing the other.

720
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:56,780
Actually, Feng Ying didn't

721
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,540
frame Chen Gong's father on purpose.

722
00:43:58,540 --> 00:43:59,730
Should my father

723
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:01,380
just die like this?

724
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:04,260
Feng Ying just had to complete his mission

725
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,570
for the interests of Shu.

726
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:08,380
No one deserves to be killed.

727
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:09,870
But between state interests

728
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:11,690
and personal lives,

729
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:12,750
I pick the former.

730
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,850
So, some people died accidentally.

731
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:16,780
They explained to each other clearly.

732
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,090
On the other hand,

733
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,420
Li Yan also did something.

734
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,980
He used the edict of the late emperor...

735
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:22,810
General Ma Dai, read the edict, please.

736
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:25,030
to threaten General Ma Dai for allegiance,

737
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:26,900
trying to draw more generals over

738
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:28,530
and deal with Prime Minister Zhuge.

739
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:29,970
I hate to say it,

740
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,740
but the late emperor's secret edict

741
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:33,050
can be used as a panacea.

742
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,020
Xun Xu is still

743
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:36,020
picking on Feng Ying.

744
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:38,060
He suspects Feng Ying is a Wei spy.

745
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:40,100
With the Prime Minister Zhuge's Token,

746
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:41,580
he wants to arrest Feng Ying.

747
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,900
Do you still think he's clear?

748
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:45,300
Chen Gong has returned.

749
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,470
We can then make concerted efforts

750
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,790
to fight against the Wei Army, right?

751
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,190
What is Feng Ying going to do?

752
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:52,060
Everybody,

753
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,120
so much for today's share.

754
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:56,460
I will go and get

755
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:57,470
some new information.
