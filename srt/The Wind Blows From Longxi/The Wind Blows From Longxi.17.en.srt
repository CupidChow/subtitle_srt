A wrong move

11
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,630
can also turn failure into victory.

Is it time for business?

19
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,600
Alright.

20
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,760
What do you want to know?

21
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,759
Is the arrest of Gao Tangbing

22
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,680
also part of your plan?

23
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,880
Chief of Intelligence Analysis

24
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,560
was the highest

25
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,040
he could go

26
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,790
in the administration of Shu.

27
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,150
But as long as he was there,

28
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:20,870
he'd pose

29
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,550
a grave threat

30
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,400
to the security of the state.

31
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:25,670
That's right.

32
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,520
Hadn't he

33
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,000
intercepted the intelligence,

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,240
the Battle of Jieting

35
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,320
could've ended otherwise.

36
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,860
What a shame

37
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,829
that he got exposed!

38
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,280
Guo Gang,

39
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,430
remember,

40
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,600
it's a trade-off.

Whoever caught Gao Tangbing

42
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,800
would be able

to rise

You knew that already

48
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,500
but you wished

49
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,560
he weren't.

(Ziyan House)

52
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,160
It astonishes me

53
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,390
that you're the real Zhulong.

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,790
It cost General Guo Huai Wuxian Sect

55
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,750
and Gao Tangbing

56
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,520
to get us

57
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,040
where we are now.

58
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,450
By planting you around General Li Yan,

59
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,110
you alone are worth 50,000 crack troops.

60
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,240
And you?

61
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,040
You're worth double, Clerk Chen.

62
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,640
I'm still one step away from success.

63
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,640
This huge loophole in Siwencao Intelligence

64
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,640
will cost Feng Ying his post.

65

Before taking complete control over it,

66
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,240
anything can happen.

67
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,640
We can do a lot more than you think.

68
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,360
Us together,

69
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,040
it equals 100,000 troops of Wei in Hanzhong.

70
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,160
We'll overthrow Shu's illegitimate reign in no time.

71
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,000
But

72
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,840
there's too big a price to pay.

73
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,760
It's nothing

74
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,560
compared with the greater good

75
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,000
and it's necessary.

76
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,680
What about Di Yue?

77
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,840
Is her death necessary?

78
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,790
Miss Liu,

79
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,880
now that you're with General Li Yan,

80
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,030
if you die,

81
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,200
that'll ruin my entire plan.

82
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,280
That's why I'm keeping you alive.

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,040
But from now on,

84
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,650
do not

85
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,560
bring up her name ever again.

86
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,440
I crossed the line.

87
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:08,640
My apologies.

88
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,840
Still, sir,

89
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,320
spies like us

90
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,150
can't have any soft spots.

91
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,760
If one gets caught,

92
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,320
that'll cost everyone else on the line.

93
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,670
You know that

94
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,880
better than anyone.

95
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,240
We're in the same boat.

96
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,920
We must

97
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,720
trust each other.

98
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,400
I'm starving.

99
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,120
Is there anything to eat?

100
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,790
I'll be right back with it.

101
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:50,650
Impossible!

102
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,280
Why would Chen Gong, a Shu spy,

103
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:56,720
defect to us?

104
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,640
People change sides all the time.

105
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,150
Everything is possible.

106
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,520
Three years ago,

107
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,350
he came to our state for intelligence

108
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,960
and then

109
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,790
I promoted him to Captain of Guards,

110
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,400
knowing

111
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,760
who he was really working for.

112
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,950
Later, when he tried to steal information,

113
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,910
I caught him in the act.

114
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,560
Even so,

115
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,880
I still don't believe it.

116
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,680
I don't believe

117
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,540
Chen Gong would give up his mission.

118
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,920
Listen,

119
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,740
I had you return to Chang'an to read at home

120
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,720
not to punish you,

121
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,550
but to show you

122
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,200
that in this world

123
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,650
humans

124
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,310
are the most complicated,

125
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,560
but also

126
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,800
the most powerful.

127
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,240
Slowly.

128
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,190
(Xun Xu's Residence in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

129
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,110
Be careful.

130
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,280
Chief, you've had a long day.

131
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,440
Get some rest.

132
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,310
Alright?

133
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:29,740
I got you.

134
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:04,790
Chief!

135
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,950
I'm fine. I got this.

136
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,100
Hands off.

137
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,200
Physician Hua said

138
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,520
the nerves in your legs are too damaged

139
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,880
to bear any pressure.

140
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,560
Chief!

141
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,550
Did you hit your head?

142
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,080
It's fine.

143
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,390
Don't worry.

144
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,510
Make some tea. Let me rest for a while.

145
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,070
Go. Go ahead.

146
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:31,970
Fine.

147
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,830
Li Yan

148
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,910
agreed to let Yang Yi back

149
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,010
to keep Feng Ying.

150
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,880
What are you going to do?

151
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,480
We must get rid of him

152
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,600
for the sake of the Qingping Plan.

153
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,320
I know.

154
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,390
Extreme measures will be taken if necessary.

155
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,600
Be on standby.

156
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,120
I'm ready to serve anytime.

157
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,920
Taking over Siwencao Intelligence

158
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,110
is a top priority.

159
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,340
Await my order.

160
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,850
You're my guest.

161
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,030
Good day, Clerk Chen.

162
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,480
Uncle,

163
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,150
how did you win Chen Gong over?

164
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,590
He's not exactly a traitor.

165
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,720
In fact,

166
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,560
he loathes those who are.

167
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,470
Yes, he does.

168
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,570
That's why

169
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,480
I never suspected him back in Tianshui.

170
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,120
However, his strongest

171
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,390
and toughest spot

172
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,070
can also be his weakest.

173
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,730
I showed him the deals

174
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,580
Feng Ying and I made.

175
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,240
Is he

176
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,030
also our spy?

177
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,960
He's not.

178
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,600
He's just a businessman.

179
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,160
We traded information a few times.

180
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,840
Information like intelligence?

181
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,670
Not the top secrets.

182
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,680
Such exchanges

183
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,000
benefited both our careers.

184
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,190
Did he sell out

185
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,950
Shu spies on the ground to you?

186
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,160
What do you think?

187
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,360
In his eyes,

188
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,720
they're no different from

189
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,400
pigs or dogs.

190
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,360
Guo Gang,

191
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:05,620
keep this in mind.

192
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,320
There's no right or wrong

193
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,710
in this dog-eat-dog world.

194
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,160
Chen Gong

195
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:25,770
would never

196
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,870
accept that.

197
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,560
Take a walk and see from another angle.

198
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,600
You'll

199
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,720
get to know the spy game.

200
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,000
There's always blood in it.

201
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,760
Ten years ago,

202
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,160
Feng Ying and I

203
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,080
made a special deal.

204
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,520
That long ago?

205
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,840
If you

206
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,720
keep doing one thing long enough,

207
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,960
it'll turn out to be something.

208
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,470
We don't play for the short term.

209
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,730
We play for the long run.

210
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,610
Sit with me.

211
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,280
Thanks.

212
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,790
Back then, General Xiahou Yuan was in Hanzhong

213
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,150
against West Shu.

214
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,270
Liu Bei and his 100,000 strong troops suddenly invaded

215
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,600
and camped right outside our pass.

216
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,880
At that critical moment,

217
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,320
I had to talk Ma Qin and Gao Sheng of West Shu

218
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,360
into defecting and attacking Zizhong County

219
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,560
to blow up the center

220
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,280
and lift General Xiahou out of the encirclement.

221
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,280
Like the strategy, besiege Wei to rescue Zhao.

222
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,190
I remember seeing this in the file

223
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,720
that Zizhong County

224
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,640
was guarded by Li Yan then.

225
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,920
Real secrets

226
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,880
are never in the file.

227
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,360
The one who gave me information about Zizhong

228
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,240
was Feng Ying.

229
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,630
Him?

230
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:17,030
What did he get in return?

231
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,670
It was a fair trade, but that's not the point.

232
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,840
The point is

233
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,640
with such information,

234
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,640
Ma Qin and Gao Sheng were unstoppable.

235
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,000
They almost wiped out Li Yan's troops.

236
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,800
Under that circumstance,

237
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:36,560
his Provision Officer, Chen Fu,

238
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,830
dressed up as Li Yan to battle with Ma Qin

239
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,510
and died on the battlefield.

240
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,270
And Chen Fu

241
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,800
was Chen Gong's father.

242
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,470
What?

243
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,430
Does that mean Chen Gong's father was killed

244
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,560
because of Feng Ying?

245
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:12,810
There are other cases

246
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,160
that Feng Ying traded with us

247
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,640
for personal gains.

248
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,310
What was the cost?

249
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,160
Spies on the ground like you.

250
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,630
Take a look

251
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,960
and see

252
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,000
if that matches what you learned

253
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,650
about Siwencao Intelligence.

254
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,200
This tea is from Wuyang of Meishan.

255
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,700
Have a sip.

256
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,680
Feng Ying

257
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,200
gave it to me last year

258
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,180
for our successful cooperation.

259
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,280
Mister Wang in Jianwei...

260
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,820
Feng Ying sold him out, too?

261
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,400
Who else would?

262
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,470
Mister Wang was wealthy.

263
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,830
Three generations of his family served Wei.

264
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,790
Without Feng Ying's information,

265
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,260
I wouldn't have believed

266
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,520
he was a spy of West Shu.

267
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,450
Why slaughter the entire clan?

268
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:27,910
No one can know about

269
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,390
the deals we made.

270
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,010
A massacre

271
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,300
would look like a revengeful murder.

272
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,880
That animal!

273
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,610
Feng Ying must pay

274
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,030
for your father's death.

275
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:46,190
He's wicked to the extreme

276
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,240
that sometimes,

277
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,880
I'd find it too much.

278
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,320
I swear

279
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,830
I'll kill him!

280
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,670
You'll get your revenge.

281
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:01,800
Be patient.

282
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,120
He killed your father

283
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,480
and he must die.

284
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,680
Die to our advantage.

285
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,600
What do you need me to do, General?

286
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,240
Nothing.

287
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,640
Nothing?

288
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,640
No,

289
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,110
in the next two or three years.

290
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,240
Just do what Siwencao Intelligence

291
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,830
tells you to

292
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,160
and keep taking orders

293
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,720
from Feng Ying.

294
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,190
This conversation

295
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,240
stays between us.

296
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,460
Or pretend it never happened.

297
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,240
I'm ordered

298
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,120
to gather your military intelligence.

299
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,480
Go on then.

300
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,440
I...

301
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,450
won't spy on you

302
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:01,950
or be able to

303
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,319
help you in any way, either.

304
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,310
You'll be on your own.

305
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:10,839
Trust me.

306
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,270
This isn't a trap.

307
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,490
But why?

308
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,240
It's the only way

309
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,760
to fool Feng Ying.

310
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:26,500
Work hard

311
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,300
and make him happy

312
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,030
so that you can get close enough

313
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,750
to kill him.

314
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,280
I have a hunch.

315
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,510
You will

316
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:44,430
change the spy game completely.

317
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,190
And my job is

318
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,950
to help you do so.

319
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,920
I see.

320
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,280
I'm in this for the long haul.

321
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,230
I have faith in you.

322
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,660
Aren't you going to eat this?

323
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,050
I had no idea

324
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,720
Chen Gong

325
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,880
would become the best of the best.

326
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,200
I was right about him.

327
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,280
But had Zhuge Liang learned

328
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,270
that Zhang He's force would raid Jieting at night,

329
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,870
-that...
-With Gao Tangbing

330
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,280
in Siwencao Intelligence,

331
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,360
we'd intercept messages

332
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,920
Chen Gong sent back immediately.

333
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,290
I am

334
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,320
in awe of you, Uncle.

335
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,120
But, next time,

336
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,920
keep me in the loop, please.

337
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,290
I felt terrible.

338
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,500
Well,

339
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,110
I would if I could.

340
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:59,960
When the false intelligence shook West Shu,

341
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,420
I sent the second order to Chen Gong

342
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,660
to let him go back.

343
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,110
So that was

344
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,540
when the Qingping Plan

345
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,280
actually started.

346
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,120
Exactly.

347
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,910
Now,

348
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,660
you're in the loop.

349
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:13,630
(Siwencao Intelligence in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

350
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,680
Clerk.

351
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,550
The court

352
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,840
was in a heated debate earlier.

353
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,550
His Majesty allowed it

354
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,990
when Prime Minister submitted the Northern Expedition Memorial.

355
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,960
It won't be that easy.

356
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,710
But that's not our concern.

357
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,830
Was Zhulong's case on the agenda?

358
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:54,440
Yes.

359
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,760
Was it bad?

360
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,480
Quite the opposite!

361
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,790
General Li vouched for you

362
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,920
and you're pardoned.

363
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:09,420
His Majesty's edict

364
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,710
will arrive soon.

365
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:12,960
Is that reliable?

366
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,720
Absolutely.

367
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,840
It's from our source in the Palace.

368
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,500
What did Prime Minister say about that?

369
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,860
He wanted Yang Yi reinstated as an exchange.

370
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:29,880
General Li said yes?

371
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,020
He did.

372
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,200
But...

373
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,320
there's a small catch.

374
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,360
You'll regain your post

375
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,000
but lose one year of pay.

376
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:01,720
I thought I'd end up as Ma Su.

377
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,830
This is

378
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,280
much better than I expected.

379
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:07,760
Yes.

380
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:08,630
That's right.

381
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,680
Has Xun Xu found anything from Gao Tangbing?

382
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,180
Not sure yet.

383
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,150
Right now, Xun Xu is in charge of the case.

384
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,180
Our department can't cross the line.

385
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,190
Now that I'm caught in a tough situation,

386
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,840
you need

387
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:36,970
to follow the case through.

388
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:40,810
Sir, are you saying...

389
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,190
Gao Tangbing was in Intelligence Analysis for years.

390
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:46,200
He could

391
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,390
drag someone else down

392
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,060
such as you, Chief Yin.

393
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,920
You two

394
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,590
were quite close, weren't you?

395
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,560
Thanks for reminding me.

396
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:00,670
I see your point.

397
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,190
I sent Chen Gong to the field

398
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,640
to keep him away from internal affairs

399
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,750
when Xun Xu is already on them.

400
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,560
The Agency

401
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,280
can't fall apart from the inside.

402
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,160
Yes, of course.

403
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:32,550
(The Royal Palace in Chengdu, the Shu State)

404
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,670
What did His Majesty say?

405
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,470
Prime Minister shall take charge of

406
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,310
military affairs

407
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:50,850
and do what he sees fit.

408
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:51,800
What?

409
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,990
Did His Majesty forget what he said?

410
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:56,940
Of course not.

411
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,570
He asked to see me in private

412
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,150
and give me other orders.

413
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,270
Make a detour

414
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,910
and then go to the north gate of the Palace.

415
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:10,590
Yes, sir.

416
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,980
(Side Hall in the Palace in Chengdu, the Shu State)

417
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,960
Is His Majesty done?

418
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:47,910
How dare you!

419
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,040
I apologize.

420
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,560
Taoist Master is still performing the ritual

421
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,510
while His Majesty is burning incense,

422
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:55,760
awaiting Supreme Lord.

423
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,400
He won't be able to see you soon.

424
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,080
What does

425
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,530
Taoist Master's divination show?

426
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,920
Supreme Lord's final will is yet to know.

427
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,180
Basically,

428
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:13,240
it favors inaction than action.

429
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,640
Zhuge Liang disregards others' opinions

430
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:22,070
and disrespects His Majesty with that Memorial.

431
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:25,750
We must do something about him,

432
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,230
or there will be dire consequences!

433
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,850
Prime Minister is too meritorious

434
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,050
to be criticized by others.

435
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,170
His Majesty's edict is as thus.

436
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:37,770
I...

437
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,260
It's a secret.

438
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,840
He's giving you the jade belt on his father

439
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,920
when he passed away in Yong'an Palace.

440
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,320
Please follow his will to carry on his legacy

441
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,380
and spare no "ginger and vinegar"

442
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,840
to assist his son

443
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,230
in restoring Han.

444
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,520
Yes, I understand.

445
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,520
Thank you.

446
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,030
You may leave.

447
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,350
He's giving you the jade belt on his father

448
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,630
when he passed away in Yong'an Palace.

449
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,960
Please follow his will to carry on his legacy

450
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:01,150
and spare no "ginger and vinegar"

451
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,570
to assist his son

452
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,820
in restoring Han.

453
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:09,860
Servant!

454
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:10,720
Yes, sir.

455
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:15,050
I need ginger juice and vinegar.

456
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:15,980
Yes, sir.

457
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,510
Those are my two conditions.

458
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,680
Either you accept them,

459
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,920
or we're done here.

460
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,390
Tangbing,

461
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,040
just look around.

462
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:30,720
Working with me

463
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,800
is your best option.

464
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:38,080
I worked in the Agency

465
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,990
much longer than you, Xun Xu.

466
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,020
I know what will happen.

467
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:47,710
Fine.

468
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,720
Let's skip the part about Gu Zheng.

469
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,470
I know

470
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,760
that's your trump card.

471
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,300
Is that some sort of trick?

472
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:07,590
Not exactly.

473
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,030
Compared with you,

474
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,150
I'm raw.

475
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,400
You can see through me easily.

476
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,480
Still,

477
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,630
you need to give me something

478
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:20,990
to report back.

479
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,050
You want to talk?

480
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,080
Sure,

481
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:32,760
except for

482
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,360
the core issue.

483
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,680
Back then, you were working with Wuxian Sect

484
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,040
to steal the design of the crossbow.

485
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,160
Correct.

486
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,670
I have one question.

487
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:48,360
By the time they grabbed the design,

488
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:51,720
our troops had sealed off 25 kilometers

489
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,240
around Mount Dingjun for searching.

490
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,570
Even if you had the design,

491
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,080
you couldn't have got it out of Shu.

492
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,340
I can answer that.

493
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:04,440
According to the rules,

494
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,560
Intelligence Analysis conducts routine checks

495
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,320
on the grain reserves in Hanzhong.

496
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,160
At that time, more grains

497
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,230
were about to go to Wudu

498
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,200
escorted by

499
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,800
Commandant Cheng Fan.

500
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,880
So

501
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,280
you would pick up the design Wuxian Sect put

502
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,400
at Gujian Xikou

503
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,550
and bury it

504
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,120
into the grains to Wudu.

505
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,070
That's right.

506
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,560
Despite the lockdown,

507
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,710
your troops wouldn't search

508
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,040
every single cart,

509
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,000
nor would they know

510
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,260
the design would be in the grains.

511
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,080
Did Commandant Cheng know?

512
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:41,770
Of course not.

513
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,780
I exploited our friendship.

514
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,190
General, it's showing!

515
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:15,410
This is a top secret

516
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,310
that concerns His Majesty's safety.

517
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,640
Guard the door.

518
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,020
Yes, sir.

519
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:32,470
Since I ascended the throne,

520
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,440
I've promoted Zhuge Liang to Marquis of Wu

521
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,650
and Commander-in-chief of Yizhou.

522
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,290
I've respected him as my father

523
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:40,420
and given him full powers in court.

524
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:42,030
Even so, peace and security

525
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,300
have yet to reach.

526
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,430
It keeps me up almost every night.

527
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:47,590
Yet he's growing brazenly contemptuous

528
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:50,180
and keeping national affairs from me.

529
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,080
Empress Dowager wishes

530
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,680
to bring him to trial before Father's tablet.

531
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,400
Also,

532
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,910
he forced me

533
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,880
to crown Zhang Fei's daughter empress.

534
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:01,330
Even Emperor Xian under Cao Cao's control

535
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,280
had never been so insulted.

536
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:05,390
Father once told Zhuge Liang,

537
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,760
"You're ten times more capable than Cao Pi.

538
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:09,490
You can assist Liu Shan

539
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,790
if he's worth it.

540
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,310
If he's not,

541
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:13,800
you should replace him."

542
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,630
Father only said so because he started

543
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:17,300
to question Zhuge Liang's loyalty.

544
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:21,050
Zhuge Liang,

545
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,470
how dare you!

546
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:28,340
How dare you!

547
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:41,190
Xun Xu,

548
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,000
I've told you as much as I can.

549
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,640
The Agency will record it

550
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:48,900
as your merit.

551
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:54,840
Sure.

552
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:58,000
All thanks to your cooperation.

553
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,830
But without immunity,

554
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:03,310
I won't let out the key information.

555
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,210
Xun Xu!

556
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,719
Xun Xu!

557
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:16,159
Xun Xu,

558
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,199
I'm not asking for too much.

559
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,389
Just tell everything to Prime Minister

560
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,110
and he'll ask His Majesty

561
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:25,310
to pardon me.

562
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,219
You're that confident, huh?

563
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:28,949
Of course.

564
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:32,110
What I know will shake Chengdu!

565
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,679
Tangbing,

566
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,920
I assure you

567
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,480
that I won't

568
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:42,520
help with your immunity.

569
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:48,790
Why?

570
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:50,449
Di Yue died because of you!

571
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:53,170
If I let you go,

572
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:55,750
I'll be betraying Chen Gong

573
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:59,210
and letting my cousin die in vain!

574
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,400
Xun Xu,

575
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,500
you're always sensible.

576
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:03,830
You know,

577
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,280
the dead are dead.

578
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,430
The rest of us have to go on.

579
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,790
Of course I know!

580
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,800
That's why I can't let you go!

581
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,390
All traitors

582
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,730
must die!

583
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:26,990
Xun Xu.

584
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:29,630
Xun Xu!

585
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:37,060
You have one more day to think it over.

586
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,060
No deal,

587
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,220
no immunity.

588
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:46,560
It's up to you.

589
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,070
If you still won't talk,

590
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:58,190
I'll make your life a living hell!

591
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:21,130
Now that Chen Gong is back,

592
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,090
as your disciple

593
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,150
and old acquaintance's son,

594
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,270
he's loyal

595
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,760
and experienced enough in intelligence

596
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:31,200
to take charge of the Agency.

597
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,280
Why would you rather keep Feng Ying?

598
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,310
It takes two

599
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,590
to balance.

600
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:43,150
Do you still have doubts about him, sir?

601
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:45,290
Hu Zhong,

602
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,560
you're too naive.

603
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,950
With all due respect,

604
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,610
letting Yang Yi back

605
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,340
to keep Feng Ying

606
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,180
is not worth it.

607
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:56,730
You're wrong.

608
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,240
With Yang Yi's return,

609
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,880
Zhuge Liang will have one more man

610
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:04,270
to run his errands.

611
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,040
But Yang Yi can't do much.

612
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,540
Even if he's full of talents,

613
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,960
he'll have nowhere

614
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,190
to use them.

615
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,760
I guess so.

616
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:15,940
Listen,

617
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,390
the Agency matters the most right now.

618
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,920
No error is allowed.

619
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:24,010
Can we really trust Feng Ying?

620
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:27,960
That's the tricky part.

621
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:32,220
Management is like the game of Go

622
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:34,270
where balance is the key.

623
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,490
I'm confused.

624
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,880
In layman's terms,

625
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,960
two are

626
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:45,030
safer than one.

627
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,690
And Chen Gong...

628
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:47,780
He's different.

629
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:50,100
As loyal as he is,

630
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:55,050
he doesn't have Feng Ying's connection

631
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:59,450
made over the past ten years in the Agency

632
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,570
and even in the Palace in Chengdu.

633
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,280
General,

634
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,780
Feng Ying of the Agency is in the way.

635
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,240
Feng Ying?

636
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,780
Let's go.

637
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,370
Yes, sir.

638
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,320
I, Feng Ying, thank you a ton, General!

639
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:26,720
Hearing that you saved my life

640
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,700
and you're on your way back,

641
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,830
I'm here waiting

642
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:31,300
to express my gratitude!

643
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:33,890
Mister Feng,

644
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,840
this is unnecessary.

645
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,600
Please rise.

646
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,400
Get up, please.

647
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:42,720
Come on. Get up now.

648
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:46,550
General.

649
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:48,400
You're one of us.

650
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,350
Enough of the thanks,

651
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,110
or I'll be mad.

652
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,760
There's one more thing

653
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,750
to report to you at my humble abode.

654
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:05,550
Get in the carriage.

655
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,490
-Please.
-After you.

656
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:12,620
This way, please.

657
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:15,990
Feng Ying,

658
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,340
I toured around the world

659
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,760
many years back,

660
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:24,840
including Jian'an and Linchuan in the Wu State.

661
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,990
The view here

662
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,910
makes me realize

663
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:32,360
how different

664
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,910
Wu is

665
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,100
from Shu and Wei.

666
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:39,410
Our land is steep,

667
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,930
and Wei's, spacious.

668
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:42,390
As unique as the landscapes are,

669
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,980
years of battle

670
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,750
between the two states

671
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:48,190
have stained all the land.

672
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,940
But here in the south,

673
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,720
it's most comfortable to live.

674
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:55,830
You're good at enjoying yourself.

675
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,960
But this mansion

676
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,050
might be too extravagant

677
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:03,490
even for your rank.

678
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,490
Isn't it too much?

679
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,960
Aren't you afraid of your reputation?

680
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,600
Sir,

681
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:14,320
it's actually not mine.

682
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,430
Whose is it?

683
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:17,530
Check it out.

684
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:18,460
Sir,

685
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:22,470
I had Sun Ling prepare this place for you.

686
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,920
In your spare time,

687
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:28,900
you can come here and relax

688
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,870
without being disturbed.

689
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,670
Feng Ying,

690
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:37,070
this is against the rules.

691
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,190
Can I come?

692
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,260
Yes, of course!

693
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:46,530
No problem, sir.

694
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,780
This isn't a bribe.

695
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,040
There's no law against it.

696
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,840
I'm lending this place to you to rest.

697
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:59,350
It might be too humble

698
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,310
to your taste.

699
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,710
Is it humble?

700
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:07,600
I can deal with that.

701
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,070
People come and go

702
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,000
in the camp in Nanzheng.

703
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,720
That place is never quiet.

704
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,130
The land here within the 2.5-kilometer radius

705
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,240
all belongs to the Agency.

706
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,390
It's private and safe.

707
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:28,520
Clerk Feng is lending this place to us.

708
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,280
It'll be rude not to take it.

709
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:32,690
Yes, sir.

710
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,320
The maids and the chefs

711
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,180
are ready to serve you.

712
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,830
Let's go inside.

713
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:40,650
Sure.

714
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:47,350
You look a lot better

715
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:48,270
than before.

716
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:49,940
Look.

717
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,200
I'm fine.

718
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,200
Chen Gong,

719
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,320
take this one.

720
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:56,990
Are you sure?

721
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:57,760
I can do it.

722
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:58,340
Alright.

723
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,680
I can finally feel

724
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,080
my broken leg.

725
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,200
It's still weak, though.

726
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,280
Physician Hua has got Hua Tuo's skills.

727
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:20,230
He's a magician!

728
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,760
Xun Xu,

729
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:24,520
I paid Gao Tangbing a visit

730
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,360
with Chief Yin at noon

731
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,880
when you were away.

732
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,470
I pressured

733
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,550
that old fox quite hard.

734
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,480
That explains

735
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,750
why he's volatile.

736
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,680
He knows the drill all too well

737
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,230
after all these years.

738
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,120
Without enough pressure,

739
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,320
he won't bend.

740
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,460
Even so, he's hoping for

741
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:54,980
immunity

742
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:56,760
and forever safety.

743
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,970
In his dreams!

744
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,710
Xun Xu,

745
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:03,890
personal grudge

746
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:05,530
has nothing to do with this case.

747
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:06,340
You need to stay calm.

748
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,200
Why not

749
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:10,620
let me interrogate him instead?

750
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,010
(The 24 Strategies of War, The Wind Blows from Longxi)
(Intelligence Agency in Longxi)

751
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:21,110
(The Seventeenth Strategy Sowing Discord)

752
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:24,430
Oh, my!

753
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:26,040
It astonishes me

754
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:28,100
that you're the real Zhulong.

755
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,960
Just when I was wondering

756
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,310
why Liu Ying and Chen Gong were together,

757
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,850
Guo Huai told Guo Gang

758
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,320
about the new Zhulong.

759
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:38,330
Turns out,

760
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,230
Chen Gong is the one.

761
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,940
Now, I get it.

762
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:43,920
Actually,

763
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,350
they spent so much time and effort

764
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:46,520
on the Qingping Plan

765
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:49,300
not to steal the design of the crossbow,

766
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:52,550
but to destroy Shu's intelligence agency

767
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,350
and infiltrate into the top level.

768
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:56,960
To make it work,

769
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,760
Guo Huai is sowing discord between them.

770
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,800
Three years ago,

771
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,360
he came to our state for intelligence.

772
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,360
I knew who he was really working for.

773
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:06,780
Guo Huai had discovered

774
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,620
Chen Gong was a Shu spy

775
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:09,680
and told him

776
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,600
about his secret trade

777
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,760
with Feng Ying.

778
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,470
That animal!

779
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:14,720
That trade

780
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,520
indirectly led to the tragic death of

781
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,590
Chen Gong's father.

782
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:20,020
Guo Huai

783
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,720
turned Chen Gong against Feng Ying

784
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:23,800
and made him

785
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,280
the new Zhulong.

786
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,270
I thought now that Gao Tangbing's gone,

787
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,710
we could finally enjoy peace.

788
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,880
Unexpectedly,

789
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:32,280
here comes a new one.

790
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:35,700
Xun Xu's interrogation hasn't made much progress

791
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,200
when Gao Tangbing refuses to cooperate.

792
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:39,040
That rat

793
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,100
hasn't said anything.

794
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:42,720
Without immunity, I won't let out the key information.

795
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,760
Immunity?

796
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,150
No way!

797
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,670
So what's Chen Gong's plan?

798
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:50,650
Is he a Wei spy now?

799
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:52,290
Will the Agency find out

800
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,410
he's become a double agent?

801
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:57,470
Wait for my follow-up.
