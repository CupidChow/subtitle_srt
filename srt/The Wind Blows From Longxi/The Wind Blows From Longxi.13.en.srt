(Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

4
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,580
Tangbing,

5
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,020
be honest with me.

6
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,420
If I

7
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,180
tell Clerk Feng

8
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,930
everything,

9
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,860
will he let me go?

10
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,340
He'll find out the truth

11
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,780
sooner or later.

12
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,340
Besides,

13
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,540
do you have another option?

14
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,350
Trust me.

15
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,300
Better sooner than later.

16
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,210
Feng Ying,

17
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,180
have something to eat.

18
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,180
You're still injured.

19
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,750
A flesh wound

20
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,060
still takes time to heal.

21
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,700
They really need

22
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,940
to clean the house in the Agency.

23
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,940
He who aims high

24
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,880
needs a broad mind.

25
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,380
Take General Li as an example.

26
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,320
He bore me no grudge for my refusal at first,

27
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,060
took me in and treated me well, didn't he?

28
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,100
A big fish like you

29
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,360
is too deep to understand.

30
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,290
Then don't speculate.

31
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,750
Focus on your work instead.

32
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,050
Now, I get it.

33
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,020
Yin Ji and Xun Xu

34
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,220
are definitely wicked.

35
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,760
It seems that Xun Xu helped you out,

36
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,020
but he was the one who set you up.

37
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,640
I bet he's plotting something.

38
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,530
You have to be careful!

39
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,810
Don't fall into his trap again!

40
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,270
What did I just say?

41
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,560
You're speculating again.

42
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,230
Who'd come this late?

43
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,370
Let me check.

44
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:08,810
Guess who?

45
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,220
It's Yin Ji.

46
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,530
I didn't open the door.

47
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,340
That snake

48
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,380
should be dead!

49
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,959
He's here to confess.

50
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,760
Let him in.

51
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,940
Come on. Don't stop!

52
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:47,680
Yue!

53
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:48,860
Yue, it's me!

54
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:49,920
I got you.

55
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,140
Come on. Get up.

56
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,740
I'm here to get you out.

57
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,690
Let's go.

58
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,100
Are you insane?

59
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,210
Yue,

60
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,880
let's get out of here first, alright?

61
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,190
Listen,

62
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,010
if you leave,

63
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,120
all your effort will be in vain.

64
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,280
You won't be able to

65
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,170
seize Zhulong.

66
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,170
And both you and Xun Xu

67
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,210
will be branded as traitors

68
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,500
and hunted for life by the Agency.

69
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,160
I don't care.

70
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,900
I can't let you suffer.

71
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,670
Let's go, Yue.

72
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,000
Yue...

73
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,270
Chen Gong,

74
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,140
you know what Huang Yu is capable of.

75
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,790
This elixir can't be removed.

76
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,220
I'll die anyway,

77
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,490
but...

78
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,240
I hate to die

79
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,730
in a horrible manner.

80
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,510
Yue,

81
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,560
I'll find the antidote.

82
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,660
Let's go.

83
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,500
Once we're out,

84
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,700
you'll be cured.

85
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,020
Chen Gong,

86
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:09,830
that...

87
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,610
that doesn't sound like you.

88
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,860
Think about it.

89
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,820
Would you rather

90
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,310
rot in here with me,

91
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,820
or

92
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,610
carry on?

93
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,750
Pull yourself together,

94
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,540
or Huang Yu will get suspicious.

95
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:36,670
This is

96
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,200
the last thing

97
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,540
I can do for you.

98
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,850
Yue.

99
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,950
Anything else?

100
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:26,740
No.

101
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,780
That's it.

102
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,540
Really?

103
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,060
I don't think so.

104
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:37,270
Chief Yin,

105
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,780
you wouldn't cave in

106
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,020
to Li Miao's bluff.

107
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:43,950
I'm so sorry, sir.

108
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,150
He got hold of evidence against me...

109
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,300
that I used our intelligence for smuggling

110
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,780
and threatened to charge me with treason.

111
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,659
I was coerced by him.

112
00:07:59,140 --> 00:07:59,860
Take a look.

113
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,900
I have the same evidence.

114
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,330
I'm guilty, sir.

115
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:06,890
Please be lenient with me.

116
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,260
I had received reports of your offense long ago,

117
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:12,660
but I never used them

118
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,260
as leverage to blackmail you, correct?

119
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,940
Please

120
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,780
spare me, sir.

121
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,700
I'll be your slave

122
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,300
for the rest of my life.

123
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,710
You should be killed.

124
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:45,620
You know why?

125
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,480
I betrayed you.

126
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,430
That's unforgivable.

127
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,090
You aren't too dumb.

128
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,430
And act like a chief, will you?

129
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,240
Stop being so spineless.

130
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,400
Huang Yu and Zhulong

131
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,700
use The Scripture on Great Peace

132
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,820
to send each other messages,

133
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,170
but I'm not sure

134
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,700
which volume it is.

135
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,740
The message says,

136
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,810
"The high-ups of the Sect

137
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,030
involve a spy of Shu,

138
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,820
a woman."

139
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,000
The code is...

140
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,460
Nine...

141
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,240
Nine.

142
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:09,620
Two, seven...

143
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,570
Two... two, seven.

144
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,770
One, five...

145
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,510
One, five.

146
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:16,290
Six...

147
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,090
Six.

148
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:18,300
Yue.

149
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,410
Give me one more day.

150
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,990
I'll get the design and come back for you.

151
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,990
Let me finish.

152
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,740
One, five...

153
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:32,450
One, five.

154
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,790
Four...

155
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,580
Four.

156
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:39,820
Nine...

157
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:40,480
Nine.

158
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:43,420
Three...

159
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,580
Three.

160
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,430
One, three...

161
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,430
One, three.

162
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:51,750
One, six...

163
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:52,610
One, six.

164
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,100
Got it?

165
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,580
Yes, I have.

166
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,340
Chen Gong,

167
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,350
I remember you...

168
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,740
you once told me

169
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,830
that Xun Xu

170
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,240
had given you

171
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,280
a dagger with deadly poison.

172
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:24,780
Do you have it with you?

173
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:26,940
Yue,

174
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,180
no.

175
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:32,940
Please don't.

176
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,590
I'm running out of time.

177
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,720
Give it to me.

178
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,820
Don't cry,

179
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,060
or it'll give you away before Huang Yu.

180
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,420
I'm going to

181
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,550
cut my tongue with the dagger.

182
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,230
The poison on it will kill me soon

183
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,880
but the Sect will think

184
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,230
I died of their poison,

185
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,140
and Huang Yu will take his eyes off you.

186
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,180
Chen Gong,

187
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,720
bring Zhulong to justice

188
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,080
so that my death will be worth it.

189
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,520
I'm glad that I can see you again

190
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,730
and die in your arms.

191
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,460
I have no regrets.

192
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,570
Tell Xun Xu,

193
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,100
I...

194
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,780
I didn't...

195
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:46,790
let him...

196
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:49,910
down...

197
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,880
I truly am sorry, sir.

198
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,740
Please

199
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,260
give me a second chance.

200
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,090
Your felony

201
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,810
will be documented.

202
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,020
Whether that document will be used or not

203
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,600
depends on your action.

204
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,380
I swear, from now on,

205
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,800
I'll be loyal to you or I'll be doomed!

206
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,050
As the old saying goes,

207
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,300
action speaks louder than words.

208
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:05,410
Save your vows.

209
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,180
Yes, sir.

210
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,040
I'll prove to you with my action.

211
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:13,930
Go home now.

212
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,530
Run your department as usual.

213
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,540
Hunt Zhulong down

214
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,830
but keep it quiet.

215
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,710
Yes, sir.

216
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,500
Chief Gao told you

217
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,770
to come to me, didn't he?

218
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,270
Uh, sir,

219
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,040
what do you mean?

220
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,010
Tell him

221
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,090
not to play such tricks

222
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,380
on me again.

223
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,770
I will.

224
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:45,960
Good night, sir.

225
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,050
How did it go?

226
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,550
Clerk Feng is good.

227
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,740
That man knows everything.

228
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:06,100
Alright,

229
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,520
since he's agreed to let it slide,

230
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,490
you can stop worrying.

231
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,420
He brought you up, too.

232
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,200
What did he say?

233
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,160
He warned us

234
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,320
not to play tricks on him again.

235
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,880
I knew he'd see right through it.

236
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,840
That's a basic skill

237
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,490
to rise to his level.

238
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,210
Tangbing,

239
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,060
you saved my life!

240
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,600
I can't thank you enough for it!

241
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,740
Come on. Stop it.

242
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,260
We're friends, aren't we?

243
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,660
Don't mention it again.

244
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,500
Come on.

245
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:39,890
Let's go.

246
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,180
Feng Ying,

247
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,190
take a foot bath

248
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:50,840
after a long day.

249
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:51,750
Thanks,

250
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,370
but this is too much.

251
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:54,890
I can do it myself.

252
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,650
You know

253
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,280
what I learned

254
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,490
after all that happened?

255
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,329
No one is trustworthy

256
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,050
except for you.

257
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,640
But why did you let Yin Ji go?

258
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,810
I don't get it.

259
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,240
Well,

260
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:26,490
you only see

261
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,850
the bright side of being an official.

262
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,490
They've got power

263
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:31,890
and money,

264
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,120
but you don't know

265
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,240
the pain

266
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,940
they have to endure.

267
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,010
Yin Ji

268
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:45,370
turned to Li Miao

269
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,840
and stabbed me in the back.

270
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,890
It hurts terribly.

271
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,440
But the Agency is too important to us

272
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:57,810
to fall apart.

273
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:01,240
Yin Ji is a rat

274
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:02,450
but he can get things done.

275
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:04,890
We still need him

276
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,290
in Operations.

277
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,090
What if

278
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,930
he betrays you again and...?

279
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,210
He won't.

280
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,250
He's smart enough

281
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:20,810
not to make the same mistake.

282
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,270
Now that he's learned his lesson,

283
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:24,130
he can be of more help.

284
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,410
You need to know that

285
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:33,090
to go further in politics.

286
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:44,410
Cheers! Let's drink!

287
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:45,450
Where's Chancellor Mi?

288
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,210
In his room the whole time.

289
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:53,810
Mister Mi!

290
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,640
Mister Mi!

291
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,220
Hey,

292
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,750
what are you doing?

293
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,400
I must've dozed off

294
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,170
while reading.

295
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,120
How long has it been?

296
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,280
Less than

297
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,680
two hours.

298
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,610
So,

299
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,200
which book

300
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,010
enchanted you?

301
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,290
Xiang'er's Commentary.

302
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:37,440
Xiang'er's Commentary on Laozi is

303
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,770
the fundamental doctrine of our sect.

304
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,000
Good choice.

305
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,450
It's nine already.

306
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,570
Let's go to her cell

307
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:59,910
and see the magic of the elixir.

308
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:01,200
Sure.

309
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,240
What happened?

310
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,320
She's dead for over one hour.

311
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:37,810
I guess

312
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,040
she took an overdose

313
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,370
and collapsed.

314
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,450
What... what a shame!

315
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,000
She didn't get to tell us anything useful.

316
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,040
Good for you!

317
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,960
Good for you!

318
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,090
Xun Xu,

319
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,140
I want to go home.

320
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:56,210
Chief Gao,

321
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,400
Clerk Feng asks to see you.

322
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,310
Do you need me, sir?

323
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,450
What's your schedule today?

324
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:08,330
Check the barns at Mount Dingjun this afternoon.

325
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,320
I'll come back in three days.

326
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,050
I thought Yin Ji would go.

327
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,280
He's a bit down lately,

328
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,210
so I'm filling in for him.

329
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:22,720
We can set it up at noon then.

330
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,560
What is it, sir?

331
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,890
I told you about it

332
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:29,570
in Ziyan House.

333
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,850
Do you mean

334
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,050
Miss Liu?

335
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,330
Yes.

336
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:38,890
I need to talk to her face to face

337
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,240
before introducing her

338
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,040
to General Li.

339
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:41,570
I see.

340
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,330
We can talk over lunch.

341
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,880
I can't be seen in a brothel

342
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:49,370
during office hours.

343
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:50,320
Sir,

344
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,680
we can take my carriage in plain clothes.

345
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,760
No one will notice us.

346
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,480
Sounds good.

347
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:58,610
Thanks.

348
00:22:58,810 --> 00:22:59,650
Sure.

349
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:02,570
Xun Xu.

350
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:05,330
Clerk Feng.

351
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:06,690
Chief Gao.

352
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,890
Here's the case file of Temple of God of Mountains on fire.

353
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:11,640
Put it here.

354
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,210
I'll take a look and talk to you later.

355
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,120
Go back to work.

356
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:19,160
Yes.

357
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:20,560
Good day, sir.

358
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:26,580
Set it up and keep it low-key.

359
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:27,720
Consider it done.

360
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:28,690
Good.

361
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,130
Miss Liu!

362
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:38,810
Miss Liu!

363
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:40,400
Miss Liu!

364
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,320
It's been a while, Mister Xun.

365
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,680
We saw each other briefly

366
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,520
about six months ago, right?

367
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:04,330
What can I do for you?

368
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:09,530
I'm here

369
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,210
to get back that flute.

370
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:15,970
I gave it to you

371
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,920
with great respect

372
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:20,960
but you showed me none and had it returned. Why?

373
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:22,640
Even if you didn't want it,

374
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,890
you could've returned it yourself.

375
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,520
Why did you send someone else?

376
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:29,690
Just because my flute isn't a rare treasure

377
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,410
doesn't mean it should be tossed around

378
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:32,570
like trash, right?

379
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,140
No, no. I...

380
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:36,050
I've never thought it that way.

381
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,330
You've returned it

382
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,730
and now, you want it back.

383
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,920
If you were me,

384
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,890
wouldn't you be annoyed?

385
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,200
I made

386
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,810
a bad decision

387
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,090
and offended you,

388
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:57,650
but I swear it wasn't

389
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:59,290
that I didn't want your flute.

390
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,720
It means a lot more to me

391
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:05,090
than you think.

392
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:06,570
That's why

393
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,080
I came here to get it.

394
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,010
Please forgive me,

395
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,130
Miss Liu.

396
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,770
Did you stop my carriage

397
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,110
for the flute

398
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,970
or me?

399
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,440
I...

400
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:38,640
I was joking.

401
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,960
Don't take it seriously.

402
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,760
I promise

403
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:11,570
that I'll cherish it

404
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:14,000
and bring it with me at all times.

405
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:29,810
(Ziyan House)

406
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,340
Greetings, Chief Gao.

407
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,440
Is Miss Liu in?

408
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,610
She's out to see someone.

409
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:42,330
It won't take long.

410
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:44,490
She'll be back soon, sir.

411
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,210
Shall I set it up at the Jinsha Pavilion?

412
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:47,720
Good enough for privacy.

413
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:50,330
A respected guest asks Miss Liu by name.

414
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:51,650
We don't want to be disturbed.

415
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,730
Of course.

416
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,810
Mister Xun,

417
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:11,800
I knew you're of great ambition

418
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,050
when you had me

419
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,770
sneak Clerk Feng out of town.

420
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,410
I'll never forget

421
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:18,920
how you put yourself in peril

422
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:20,960
for me that day.

423
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:23,760
The ancients said

424
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:26,810
to always be grateful for others' help,

425
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,040
not to mention

426
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:31,720
lifesaving.

427
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,400
As humble as I am,

428
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,330
I have morals.

429
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:40,050
I'm happy to return the favor

430
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,920
if you need.

431
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,240
Well,

432
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:50,830
I do need one.

433
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,040
I expected so.

434
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:56,570
What do you need me to do?

435
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,900
I heard

436
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,090
Clerk Feng would come to see you.

437
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,290
I need

438
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,250
something from him,

439
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,550
the seal he carries around.

440
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:17,330
That's it?

441
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,730
So you'll do it?

442
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:22,410
Go to the side door

443
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:24,170
outside Ziyan House at 12.

444
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:25,640
Ying'er will let you in.

445
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:27,170
Ying'er?

446
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,610
My maid assigned by Ziyan House.

447
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:32,200
Noted.

448
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:33,730
I should go.

449
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,730
I can't be out for too long

450
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:35,850
or Madam Wang will be mad.

451
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,080
Aren't you

452
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,930
going to ask me why?

453
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,090
Mister Xun,

454
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,290
I'll do anything for you.

455
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,530
No questions asked.

456
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:52,960
No strings attached.

457
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,320
Greetings...

458
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,090
Greetings, ma'am.

459
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,230
They say

460
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,610
great heroes wield sharp swords.

461
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:46,670
Take this.

462
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,930
It's a pleasure to meet you.

463
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,920
One year at most.

464
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:57,530
It'll only be three months.

465
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:58,800
We'll meet again soon.

466
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:01,410
If you and Xun Xu can be spies,

467
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:02,410
why can't I?

468
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,650
Besides,

469
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:05,490
we can probably see each other

470
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,040
at work.

471
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,090
Knowing that Han will be restored,

472
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:15,420
you're there for me

473
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,570
and we'll meet again soon,

474
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,930
I feel less pain.

475
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,850
Mister Mi, it's about time.

476
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,170
Leader is waiting.

477
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:42,970
Got it.

478
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:44,210
I'm coming.

479
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,490
Don't cry.

480
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:57,850
I'm glad that I can see you again

481
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:02,410
and die in your arms.

482
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,050
I have no regrets.

483
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:29,050
Mister Mi,

484
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:30,970
these 18 warriors

485
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:32,370
are the best of the best

486
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:33,880
in our sect.

487
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,760
They'll slip into

488
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,330
the head office with you.

489
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,810
Meanwhile, the main force and I

490
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,270
will wait for you

491
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,130
under the cliff.

492
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:48,400
Great.

493
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:50,650
Let's go.

494
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,130
Watch Mister Mi closely tomorrow night.

495
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:57,770
Make sure he jumps off from the designated location.

496
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,640
Why?

497
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,010
I have a bad feeling

498
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:03,770
about that woman's sudden death.

499
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,090
Mister Mi...

500
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:06,770
Aren't you being paranoid?

501
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,290
We can never be too careful.

502
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,610
If he does anything strange,

503
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,330
finish him immediately.

504
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,650
But I'm strange to the Bamboo Kite.

505
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,230
Once we arrive at the new camp,

506
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,880
ask him how to use it

507
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:24,450
but be subtle.

508
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,050
You'll be between life and death

509
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,850
in the Military Technology Department.

510
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:31,680
Bring back the design

511
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,440
at all costs.

512
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:37,930
Yes, sir.

513
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,320
I'll watch his every move.

514
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:50,290
Clerk.

515
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,460
Greetings, Clerk Feng,

516
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:55,490
Chief Gao.

517
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,530
Please, Miss Liu.

518
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,240
I'm too humble

519
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:06,270
to sit with you, sir.

520
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:07,810
Miss Liu,

521
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:10,270
our status aside,

522
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,840
you did me a huge favor.

523
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,770
I'd like to thank you

524
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:18,160
with this drink.

525
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:22,600
That's very kind of you.

526
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:24,920
It'd be rude not to comply.

527
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,770
It's better to be seated

528
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,000
without the veil.

529
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,680
As you wish.

530
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,250
Last time, I only

531
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:56,090
caught a glimpse of you.

532
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:57,840
Now, I see

533
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:00,640
how gorgeous, delicate

534
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,170
and fair you are.

535
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:05,160
I'm not, sir.

536
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:14,489
Miss Liu, drink with Clerk Feng

537
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:15,760
as long as he likes.

538
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:18,739
Aren't you having lunch with us, Chief Gao?

539
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:20,280
I can't.

540
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,080
I'm going to Mount Dingjun for inspection.

541
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,980
Give General Ma Dai my regards when you see him.

542
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:26,929
I will.

543
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,889
Chief Xun?

544
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,280
I am.

545
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:00,570
I'm Ying'er.

546
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,010
Miss Liu sent me here.

547
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,160
Please follow me.

548
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:34,760
Chief Xun,

549
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,440
Miss Liu said you can wait here.

550
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,090
Thank you.

551
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:07,690
You surely can drink, Miss Liu.

552
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:10,920
Miss Liu,

553
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,810
let's play a game.

554
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,290
How about a puzzle?

555
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,050
Like a riddle?

556
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,490
You do have class, Clerk Feng.

557
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,530
Let's hear it.

558
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,240
She writes like no one.

559
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:35,220
He fights like no man.

560
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,170
What's the answer about?

561
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:41,030
Two Han sages.

562
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:47,450
A man and a woman.

563
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,700
One writes and the other fights.

564
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:52,970
That riddle is

565
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:54,160
a stroke of genius.

566
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,450
Are they Zhuo Wenjun (famous poetess)

567
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,090
and Zhou Yafu (renowned general)?

568
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:02,930
Yes! Correct!

569
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:04,690
Well done!

570
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,920
You're too smart!

571
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:14,010
Miss Liu,

572
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,610
I lost again.

573
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:20,640
One more cup for me.

574
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,890
I'll drink with you.

575
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:34,930
Miss Liu,

576
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,500
frankly speaking,

577
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:43,090
given your talent, looks and mind,

578
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,800
you deserve a much better place.

579
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,970
I'm of humble birth.

580
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,770
Without my looks,

581
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:56,570
I wouldn't be able to support myself.

582
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:59,040
I'm satisfied with what I have now.

583
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:02,330
You don't know how rare you are, Miss Liu.

584
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:05,890
Legend has it that Zhao Feiyan and Wang Zhaojun

585
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,610
are the fairest,

586
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,620
but in reality,

587
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,450
only you

588
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:22,440
deserve such a title.

589
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:28,280
That's very nice of you to say.

590
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:30,070
I'm extremely flattered.

591
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,680
It'd be my honor

592
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:41,320
to serve you.

593
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,650
Unless you think

594
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:56,850
I'm lowly.

595
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,090
Of course not!

596
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,530
All men would be

597
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:02,490
too obsessed with you

598
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,000
to think anything

599
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,950
the moment they saw you.

600
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,570
If so, why are you turning me down?

601
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:16,650
Miss Liu,

602
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,650
you don't know how this works.

603
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,400
You're one of a kind.

604
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:27,250
What do men need

605
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:29,840
in order to be with you?

606
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:32,650
Power.

607
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,000
Without it,

608
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:39,170
I'd never be able to see you,

609
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,250
let alone

610
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,160
sit and drink with you, right?

611
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:48,450
All I'm hearing is

612
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,080
I'm not good enough for you.

613
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:54,850
Oh, you little fox!

614
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:17,960
Don't get me wrong.

615
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,560
We can enjoy the hot spring together

616
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:20,930
in the yard.

617
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:22,810
No need to panic.

618
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:37,840
When you put it like that,

619
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:40,730
I'm intrigued.

620
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,450
Let's see

621
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,080
what's so special outside.

622
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,530
What a misty wonderland!

623
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,330
The name, "Ziyan" (purple vapor), does it justice.

624
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,200
Is this the one?

625
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,730
Yes! Exactly!

626
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:09,450
You've never looked this happy

627
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,810
in front of Miss Liu.

628
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,610
Please wait a minute outside.

629
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:18,690
Yes, sir.

00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:56,210
Thank you, Miss Ying'er,

632
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:58,810
and please convey my thanks to Miss Liu.

633
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:01,010
You're welcome.

Guys,

637
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:23,800
this is a day of tears!

638
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:25,810
Di Yue

639
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:28,090
finally saw Chen Gong

640
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,640
but that was right before she died in his arms.

641
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:34,570
She told him everything she knew

642
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,450
and not to expose himself at the last minute.

643
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:40,160
Maybe Feng Ying is right.

644
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:40,950
Death is

645
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:43,240
what spies can hope for the best.

646
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,480
Speaking of him,

647
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:48,490
Liu Ying is using obviously

650
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:56,370
Don't get me wrong.

651

We can enjoy the hot spring together

652
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:00,490
in the yard.

653

Little did you know,

654
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:05,430
your seal would be taken.

655
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:06,890
Hey, man,

656
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:08,390
honestly,

657
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,240
I envy you

658
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,810
having such a beauty around,

659
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:14,640
but you've never cared about women.

660
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,500
What's wrong with you today?

661
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:17,040
Why?

662
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:18,700
Or are you up to something?

663
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:19,650
Anyway,

664
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:20,930
thanks to Miss Liu,

665
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:23,700
Xun Xu was able to forge a permit

666
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:26,260
to enter the head office of Military Technology.

667
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:26,880
So,

668
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:29,420
now that Xun Xu has gained the access

669
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:30,930
to that place,

670
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:34,200
will he be able to help Chen Gong out?

671
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,960

672
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:38,290
threaten Chen Gong's cover again?

673
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:39,950
Find out with Sun Ling.

674
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:43,000
See you tomorrow.
