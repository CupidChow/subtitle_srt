(The Seventh Strategy Deceive the Heavens to Cross the Ocean)

3
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:42,650
Clerk Li,

4
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,530
hope you won't mind.

5
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,530
The room is a little shabby.

6
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:47,850
Here's some great tea. Try some.

7
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,600
Don't bother.

8
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,080
I don't drink tea.

9
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,009
Today, I came here privately

10
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,430
because I want to speak my mind

11
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,420
to you, Chief Yin.

12
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,780
Chief Yin, I've been working in Siwencao for over a month now,

13
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,540
but

14
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,340
I haven't accomplished anything yet.

15
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,090
General Li

16
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,360
didn't dispatch me to Siwencao

17
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,980
so that I can idle away.

18
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:15,660
Chief Yin,

19
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,900
do you know what General Li's intention is?

20
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,420
I'm slow-witted.

21
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,090
Clerk Li, please enlighten me.

22
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,820
Our nation's power

23
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:30,370
remains weak.

24
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,140
And the wars are still ongoing.

25
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,380
Yet the Prime Minister

26
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,420
insists on conquering Wei

27
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,770
at a high cost that weakens our state.

28
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,860
I've always been an order taker,

29
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,170
never a leader.

30
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,540
I'm very insensitive about the state affairs.

31
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,470
The court officials all keep silent for fear

32
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,250
of the Prime Minister's power.

33
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,320
General Li Yan is the only one who dares to step forward

34
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,270
and speak the truth fearlessly.

35
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,390
Taking over Siwencao is only the first step

36
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,780
of General Li Yan's big plan.

37
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,700
Clerk Li,

38
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,810
what you are talking about is a matter of grave importance.

39
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,020
With my low position,

40
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,820
I think you…

41
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,460
But Feng Ying

42
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,660
has absolute control over Siwencao.

43
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,140
Without some solid proof,

44
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,340
how could we possibly take down Yang Yi

45
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,579
for good?

46
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,810
I know you are Feng Ying's confidant.

47
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,030
If we can join hands,

48
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,180
there's nothing we can't accomplish.

49
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,300
Clerk Li, you overestimated me.

50
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,860
I'm just an insignificant Chief.

51
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,700
But the things you've done were not insignificant at all.

52
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,140
Over the years, you faked instructions

53
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,180
and used the intelligence network of the Operations Department

54
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,610
to smuggle things to the Wu and Wei States.

55
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,420
For your own interest.

56
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,380
Every deal you made

57
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,860
is clearly recorded here.

58
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,490
See for yourself.

59
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,870
And regarding the Jieting's false intelligence case,

60
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,650
someone also used Gu Zheng's intelligence network

61
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,970
to deliver our top military secrets to the Wei State.

62
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,940
What are the odds?

63
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,820
I deserve to die.

64
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,220
I do.

65
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,060
It's true that I got greedy for money,

66
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,540
but I swear that I'm not a traitor!

67
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,460
Is this how you're planning to defend yourself in front of General Li Yan?

68
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,260
Chief Yin, you don't have

69
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,210
the guts to do it, do you?

70
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,460
Let me offer you a way out.

71
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:21,460
You want to combine the Jieting case

72
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,730
and the Zhulong case.

73
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,060
You still have doubts about Baidi's treachery?

74
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,180
Yes.

75
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,580
There's another possible explanation

76
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,180
for Jieting's false intelligence case.

77
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,100
Baidi's intelligence was right when he sent it out.

78
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,500
But it was swapped by Zhulong

79
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,020
when it got to Mount Qi base camp.

80
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,740
This person's got to be at the front line

81
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,860
and familiar with our operation plan.

82
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,180
And he had access to the Jieting intelligence

83
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,620
and Baidi's code-cracking plates.

84
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,460
Looks like I meet all the things

85
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,790
you just mentioned.

86
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,810
Clerk Feng, if you worked for Wei,

87
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,860
Baidi would've long been exposed.

88
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,340
So you suspect Sun Ling?

89
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,900
That's ridiculous.

90
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,740
Is Baidi's case not?

91
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,230
You've been telling me

92
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,880
since I started working here

93
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,230
that no evidence, no case.

94
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:31,860
That's right.

95
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,950
So where's your evidence?

96
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,220
Chen Gong was your brother-in-law.

97
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,750
I understand you want to vindicate him.

98
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,860
But I have to tell you

99
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,860
that what's done

100
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,200
can't be undone.

101
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,780
Even if we later

102
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,010
find out that Baidi is innocent,

103
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,780
he's already dead after all.

104
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,560
We must close the Jieting case as soon as possible.

105
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,950
This is for the bigger picture.

106
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,670
And it has nothing to do with investigating Zhulong.

107
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,380
Don't think that I'm saying this because I'm trying

108
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,650
to protect Sun Ling.

109
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,230
Think about it.

110
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,430
What will happen if you investigate him?

111
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,730
Everybody will link him to me in the end.

112
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,580
I don't want you

113
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,140
to get involved in political strife.

114
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,830
Do you understand?

115
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,100
Clerk Feng, I'll think

116
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,240
about what you said.

117
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:33,570
Siwencao

118
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,470
is a powerful weapon for our state.

119
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,250
I can't let it become a political tool.

120
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,010
Li Miao has an ulterior motive.

121
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,659
You got to know that.

122
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,580
I know.

123
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,100
I'm glad you do.

127
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:03,540
Nice to meet you, Sect Leader Huang.

128
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,470
Envoy, you traveled a long way here.

129
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,010
Fellow Elders,

130
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,940
let's welcome the Envoy of Wei.

131
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,740
Envoy of Wei, welcome!

132
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,680
Huang Yu, accept the edict.

133
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,040
According to His Majesty's edict,

134
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,040
Huang Yu,

135
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,300
the Leader of Wuxian Sect, is hereby appointed

136

as General Who Pacifies the South, and Vanguard Chief of the Hanzhong Region.

137
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,190
Please accept the edict.

138
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:12,940
Long live the Emperor.

139
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,520
Thank you, Envoy.

140
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,510
Gods are now with us.

141
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,730
Offer the three animals as sacrifices.

(Di Yue, Saint Lady of Wuxian Sect and a spy of the Shu State)

143

144
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,020
this is the Saint Lady of our sect.

(Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

146
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:42,940
Chief Xun,

147
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,140
you are still here.

148
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,110
Feng Ying talked to me this afternoon.

149
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,020
He said

150
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,720
Siwencao is a powerful weapon to our state,

151
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,430
and he can't let it become a political tool.

152
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,020
He sure made it sound nice.

153
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,210
(Pei Xu, Clerk of Internal Affairs Department, Siwencao Intelligence, the Shu State)
He sure made it sound nice.

154
00:12:59,210 --> 00:12:59,840
(Pei Xu, Clerk of Internal Affairs Department, Siwencao Intelligence, the Shu State)

155
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,700
He wants to close the case as soon as possible.
(Pei Xu, Clerk of Internal Affairs Department, Siwencao Intelligence, the Shu State)

156
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:00,730
(Pei Xu, Clerk of Internal Affairs Department, Siwencao Intelligence, the Shu State)

157
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,440
Apparently he's also using Siwencao as a card.
(Pei Xu, Clerk of Internal Affairs Department, Siwencao Intelligence, the Shu State)

158
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,300
And he's shown his hand.

159
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,300
He doesn't allow me to investigate Sun Ling.

160
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,040
He also told me

161
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,380
that Li Miao must have an ulterior motive

162
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,020
working here in Siwencao.

163
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,040
If Clerk Feng doesn't agree,

164
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,330
it'll be difficult for you to proceed with the investigation.

165
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,390
Even so,

166
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,380
you are still going to investigate Sun Ling?

167
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:32,630
Yes.

168
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,920
I will.

169
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,310
Chief Xun.

170
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,650
Chief Sun.

171
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,390
Guys, how are you doing?

172
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:21,800
(Ziyan House, Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

173
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,780
Sir, this way, please.

174
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,870
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

175
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,740
How dare you be late for Clerk Feng's treat?

176
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,000
If we waited any longer,

177
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,120
we'd both starve to death.

178
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,380
In times of crisis like this,

179
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,430
the ones who still dare show up for the dinner

180
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,000
are all my best friends.

181
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:57,170
Clerk Feng, I'm flattered.

182
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,500
I know

183
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,430
what I'm doing,

184
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,560
otherwise I wouldn't invite you out for dinner like this.

185
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,520
Today's case analysis meeting

186
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:09,900
was like a challenge.

187
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:11,530
What do you think about it?

188
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,410
I think Clerk Li

189
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,510
wants to settle old scores.

190
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,910
Investigating Zhulong

191
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,610
is just a front

192
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,300
for seizing the real power.

193
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,610
He wants to take me down.

194
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,470
When it comes to the Clerk position,

195
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,860
you are the only one

196
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,690
who's worthy of the title in our hearts.

197
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,400
We'll follow

198
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,620
your lead only.

199
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,530
You two

200
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,220
are both veterans in Siwencao.

201
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,460
You must have your own judgment.

202
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,310
Clerk Li is new here, so it makes sense

203
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,030
that he wants to make a name for himself.

204
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,430
It's not that simple.

205
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,350
Let me be straight with you,

206
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,070
Chengdu is going through a difficult situation.

207
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,340
The aftereffect of the failure of the Prime Minister's Northern Expedition

208
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,650
is getting more and more severe.

209
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,980
General Li Yan went to meet His Majesty in Chengdu

210
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,970
and had a dozen of eminent clans in Xichuan jointly sign

211
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:02,950
a memorandum to propose the impeachment

212
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,630
of the Prime Minister and the removal of his military power.

213
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:11,430
Ever since the Prime Minister left his residence in Longzhong

214
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,380
to follow the Late Emperor, he's been making great contributions.

215
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,690
He's the one who literally laid half

216
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,240
of the foundation for our state.

217
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,280
General Li Yan was also highly valued by the Late Emperor.

218
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,800
If he wants to take down the Prime Minister, I'm afraid…

219
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:24,730
He's right.

220
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,300
Siwencao

221
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,820
consists of the Prime Minister's henchmen.

222
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,620
Clerk Feng,

223
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,030
what's your concern?

224
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,420
You are

225
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:34,650
both right.

226
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,650
And that's why…

227
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,060
One's great merits can be a threat to his superior.

228
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,360
You must have a concern.

229
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,760
I didn't say that.

230
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,020
I didn't.

231
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,550
Don't be a smartass.

232
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,410
You should be punished. Drink.

233
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:46,900
Alright.

234
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,470
Let's drink together.

235
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,280
Please.

236
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,540
About Li Yan's impeachment proposal,

237
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:00,930
I think a decision will be made within 10 days.

238
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,140
At this point,

239
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,530
we can't give Li Miao an excuse

240
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,329
that he can use against Siwencao.

241
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,660
If it's true that a mole in Siwencao

242
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,270
attributed to the failure of Jieting battle,

243
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,140
Chief Yang will be definitely held accountable,

244
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,859
and that'll put the Prime Minister

245
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,319
in a much more difficult position.

246
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,960
Clerk Feng, don't worry.

247
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,750
Neither Chief Yin nor I

248
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,579
am the politician type of people.

249
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:26,849
Just let us know

250
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,020
if you need anything.

251
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,110
That's right.

252
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:29,980
Please.

253
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:42,490
(Li Miao's Mansion, Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

254
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,710
(Yang Yi)

255
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,920
Yang Yi, despicable man.

256
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,080
(Yang Yi)

257
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:03,490
Sir,

258
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,580
Chief Xun Xu of Siwencao is here to see you.

259
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,010
Xun Xu?

260
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,720
Someone swapped Baidi's intelligence regarding Jieting?

261
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,840
Baidi told me in person before he died.

262
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,130
Do you have evidence?

263
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,880
I only have collateral evidence.

264
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,290
Since Gu Zheng's intelligence line had a problem,

265
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,950
it was possible that Baidi's intelligence was swapped.

266
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,300
Do you think Clerk

267
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:34,380
Feng Ying

268
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,470
is Zhulong?

269
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,140
On the face of it,

270
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,260
only Clerk Feng can crack

271
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,340
the codes of Baidi's intelligence,

272
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,220
which is too easy.

273
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,260
I don't think it's him.

274
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,910
So you are suspecting

275
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:52,700
Sun Ling?

276
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,700
Is this why you came to me?

277
00:18:59,100 --> 00:18:59,740
Yes.

278
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,510
Clerk Feng talked to me

279
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,130
this afternoon.

280
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,480
He doesn't allow me to investigate.

281
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,330
Good.

282
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,090
You are right

283
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,940
to come to me.

284
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:17,500
Here.

285
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,290
The wine

286
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,890
is… is nothing to me.

287
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,470
Right.

288
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,730
Right?

289
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,750
Let's… Let's continue.

290
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,230
I can drink more.

291
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,360
Yeah, you can.

292
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,830
I can drink more.

293
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,180
I was going to join you in the bath,

294
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,840
yet you took one early today.

295
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:22,620
We haven't held a ceremony yet.

296
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,640
Sect Leader, please stop flirting with me.

297
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,620
Today is as good a day as any.

298
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,180
What do you think, Saint Lady?

299
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:30,770
Sect Leader,

300
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,400
you just received Wei's appointment today.

301
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,340
Don't tell me

302
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,120
you forgot our sect rules already.

303
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,660
I was wondering why you've been looking sulky today.

304
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,740
Turns out you are unhappy about this.

305
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,740
Your appointment is a pleasant thing,

306
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,760
but I can't help feeling sorry for you.

307
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,180
What do you mean?

308
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,080
I came to join Wuxian Sect

309
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,820
because I admired you for your heroic feats

310
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,260
and your rare talent.

311
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,860
I didn't expect

312
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,820
that you'd accept the appointment and become

313
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,020
someone's subordinate now.

314
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,220
I take it as a big shame.

315
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,250
Well,

316
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:14,990
it's a pity

317
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,400
that though our Wuxian Sect is filled with strong men,

318
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,390
none of them is as insightful as a woman.

319
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,760
What do you mean?

320
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:33,870
I did

321
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,940
accept the Wei's appointment today,

322
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,620
but it's just a makeshift plan.

323
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,480
One day, I will definitely

324
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,460
succeed in reviving our sect

325
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,120
and annexing

326
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,760
Wei, Shu, and Wu.

327
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,340
Saint Lady, you know me very well.

328
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,380
You are indeed

329
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,120
a precious godsend to me.

330
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,470
Sect Leader, hope

331
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,660
you'll remember what you said in the future.

332
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:04,840
Of course I will.

333
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,380
It's getting late.

334
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,520
Please rest early.

335
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,490
Xun Xu is so ungrateful.

336
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,440
You are like

337
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,980
a mentor to him.

338
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,630
How could he turn against you for outsiders?

339
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,590
No.

340
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,660
I think Xun Xu was only forced to carry out the order,

341
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:40,830
but inside,

342
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:43,830
he never believed that Baidi betrayed us.

343
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,380
Tangbing is right about him.

344
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,530
That's exactly what Xun Xu thinks.

345
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,590
If Baidi didn't betray us,

346
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,310
Xun Xu

347
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:55,720
would surely think

348
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,490
that there's a Wei spy in our agency.

349
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,390
I don't think it's that complicated.

350
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,060
I think he's just playing up to Clerk Li

351
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:03,940
because he's holding greater power.

352
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,790
Don't talk nonsense.

353
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:09,710
We must put the Jieting case

354
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,180
to an end now.

355
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,060
Chief Yang reminded me that the Zhulong case

356
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,940
would be thoroughly investigated soon.

357
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:19,020
You two have got to be careful

358
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,580
in case being framed by someone.

359
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,340
We will.

360
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,020
Understood.

361
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,420
The wine says it all.

362
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,620
Tangbing,

363
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,770
you are quite close to Xun Xu.

364
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:30,820
Please keep an eye on him.

365
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,100
Xun Xu

366
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,180
is too straightforward.

367
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:34,540
Don't let anybody take advantage of him.

368
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,620
Xun Xu is my friend.

369
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,260
I don't feel comfortable

370
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,380
keeping an eye on him.

371
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:44,340
Let me do it.

372
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,180
This is what I've been trained to do in the Operations Department.

373
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,060
I'm good at it.

374
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,140
Xun Xu,

375
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,100
how do you want me to help you?

376
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,260
The first step

377
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,110
is to confirm

378
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,620
the code-cracking plates used to crack the intelligence codes.

379
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:05,000
The code-cracking plates?

380
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:05,670
Yes.

381
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,420
The plates

382
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,660
are in a set of boxes,

383
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:11,150
and they are heavily guarded.

384
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:11,810
During the wartime,

385
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,920
Sun Ling would personally lead

386
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,400
12 White-feather Warriors to escort them.

387
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,380
There's no way to take them out

388
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,110
without permission.

389
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,110
Hmm.

390
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:26,620
I'll take care of it.

391
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,130
Here.

392
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:31,800
But, Xun Xu,

393
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,830
could there be another possibility?

394
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:36,660
What is it?

395
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:39,970
Since the intelligence had to be delivered

396
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,110
in the shortest time possible,

397
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:45,110
even if Zhulong wanted to falsify a piece of intelligence,

398
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,500
it was beyond his capability.

399
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,020
Clerk Li, you mean…

400
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,680
No one could crack the original intelligence

401
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:54,790
except for Clerk Feng.

402
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:56,370
Then

403
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,600
it's possible that someone changed the information

404
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,030
while cracking the codes.

405
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,230
There's no

406
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,760
such possibility.

407
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,320
Once the plates

408
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:09,860
and the intelligence codes are put together,

409
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,610
the contents can't be changed anymore.

410
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,120
Clerk Li, how about this?

411
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,340
As soon as I get the plates,

412
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,900
I'll recheck the intelligence immediately.

413
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:23,710
Alright.

414
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,310
Let's do it.

415
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,860
Feng Ying, bad news.

416
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,860
Will you calm down?

417
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,140
I told you to stay cool no matter what happens.

418
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:47,860
How can I stay cool?

419
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,700
I saw Xun Xu go to Li Miao's place.

420
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:51,940
Right now?

421
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,090
Yes.

422
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,970
I think instead of investigating Zhulong,

423
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,380
he's trying to stab you in the back.

424
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,180
This Xun Xu

425
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,850
appears to be honest and loyal,

426
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,700
-but in fact, he's sly.
-Alright, enough.

427
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,900
Quit spying on Xun Xu.

428
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,920
You are just eyeing the Chief position of the Internal Affairs Department.

429
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:17,890
I'll go to bed now.

430
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,440
Wait. I…

431
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:22,990
Feng Ying.

432
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,540
Truth usually hurts, Feng Ying.

433
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,420
What did Clerk Li say?

434
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,700
We'll take action tomorrow.

435
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,670
He'll help me take out the code-cracking plates.

436
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,530
Once it's done,

437
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:40,050
there's no turning back.

438
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,140
I just remembered

439
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,800
that I left something in the agency.

440
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:53,710
You go.

441
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:54,560
I have to get back and fetch it.

442
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:55,490
Alright.

443
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:19,280
(Ziyan House)

444
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,340
You are finally out.

445
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,990
The guests today

446
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:28,450
are all aides to General Ma Dai.

447
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,810
Make sure to serve them well.

448
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,080
If you can gain favor from them,

449
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,980
you'll be well off in the future.

450
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:38,790
Let's go.

451
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:44,350
(Liu Ying, Musician of Ziyan House, the Shu State)

452
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:57,650
Waiter, bring us another bottle of wine.

453
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:58,860
Now, look.

454
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,180
You lost. You have to drink.

455
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:03,060
I can't drink anymore.

456
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,780
But you lost. You have to drink.

457
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,420
That's right.

458
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,540
Come on.

459
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,140
Hurry.

460
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:10,030
Nice.

461
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:12,930
Miss Liu,

462
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,540
I remember you still have to drink two more cups.

463
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:16,940
Yeah.

464
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:17,700
That's right.

465
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,660
You got to keep your word.

466
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:22,950
Drink it up.

467
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,140
One more.

468
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,540
Come on, Miss Liu.

469
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,550
My name is Liu Ying.

470
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,820
Thank you for stepping up

471
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:02,970
and saving my life, hero.

472
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:01,530
Baidi

473
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:04,070
is Chen Gong,

474
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:06,350
the Recorder in Tianshui.

475
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,490
Siwencao would definitely launch an investigation

476
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,510
because of the sudden death of Gu Zheng.

477
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,330
Commander Guo asked us

478
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,700
to stop using the intelligence system in the west of Shu.

479
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:20,960
My job

480
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,130
is to help you set up a new intelligence line.

481
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,980
From now on, I'll be in charge

482
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:26,100
of delivering all your intelligence.

483
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:36,830
(Liu Ying, a spy of the Wei State)

484
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:42,390
(Baidi is the Chen Gong, the Recorder in Tianshui)

485
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:53,790
(Canyon in Wuxian Sect's domain, Border of the Shu State)

486
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:20,920
(Baidi is the Chen Gong, the Recorder in Tianshui)

487
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,130
It's humid and cold in the cave.

488
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,420
Make sure to put on more layers.

489
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,990
I prepared some herbal tonics for you,

490
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:31,420
and I've put them in your chamber.

491
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,700
Thank you, Sect Leader.

492
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,580
It's my pleasure.

493
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,530
Greetings, Sect Leader.

494
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:38,980
Greetings, Saint Lady.

495
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,960
Miaofeng has an urgent message for you.

496
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,620
I'll go sort out the teachings now.

497
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:48,140
Thanks, Saint Lady.

498
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:59,090
According to Zhulong's intelligence,

499
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,470
the Shu spy Baidi who's been lurking in Wei

500
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,560
is Chen Gong, the Recorder

501
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,580
in Tianshui.

502
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:08,260
Following the Governor Guo Gang's order,

503
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,940
he used the name Chen Wei

504
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,889
and entered Shu with Mr. Mi.

505
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:18,070
If the one that the Shu army killed

506
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,010
in Yangping Pass wasn't him,

507
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:22,449
he should be

508
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,949
in Wuxian Sect now.

509
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:27,679
Pass my order.

510
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,139
Ask all the sub-sects

511
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,510
to leave the headquarters immediately.

512
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:31,219
Aye.

513
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,020
Qin Ze.

514
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,969
For peace of mind,

515
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:43,760
try to find out

516
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,460
the real identity of this Mi Chong.

517
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:47,199
Yes.

518
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:04,020
(Siwencao Intelligence, Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

519

Clerk Li.

520
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,340
Clerk Li.

521
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,770
You want to see me?

522
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,650
Good timing.

523
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:42,030
I have a question, and I hope you can answer it for me.

524
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:43,590
Clerk Li,

525
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,310
it's my pleasure to help.

526
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,340
Just tell me

527
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,700
what you want to know.

528
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,710
Siwencao

529
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,470
uses codes when delivering

530
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:57,030
important intelligence, right?

531
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,420
Yes.

532
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:01,600
Siwencao and the spies all have the code-cracking plates

533
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:02,780
so as to assure

534
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,450
the accuracy of the intelligence.

535
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,570
Take a look.

536
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:10,770
Are

537
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:12,340
the plates like this?

538
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:14,170
Yes, they are.

539
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:15,750
Look.

540
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,770
You can write the intelligence

541
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,340
in the blank areas,

542
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,620
and then

543
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:24,520
randomly write some

544
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:26,350
irrelevant words elsewhere.

545
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,710
In this way, no one would know

546
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,560
what the intelligence is.

547
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,600
Did Baidi also use plates like this

548
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,540
to write the intelligence?

549
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:38,820
Yes.

550
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:39,880
But,

551
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,630
Baidi was a top-level spy,

552
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,880
so his plates had special tricks.

553
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:46,290
Now that

554
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:47,680
it's confirmed

555
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:49,160
that Baidi was a traitor,

556
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,410
the tricks of his plates have been disclosed.

557
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:54,110
Otherwise, it'd be of absolute secrecy.

558
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,410
What's the security level?

559
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:57,230
Guarded heavily,

560
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,500
and only Clerk Feng

561
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:00,350
had the key to the plate box.

562
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,630
No one could even get close

563
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,860
to it without his permission.

564
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,610
Where are the plates now?

565
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,200
Still in the warehouse.

566
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:11,860
But the procedures are much easier.

567
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:14,740
Clerk Li, if you want to take a look at them,

568
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:15,900
just let me know.

569
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,730
Where's Clerk Feng?

570
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,270
He's not here today.

571
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:26,380
Alright.

572
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,940
Then let's go to the warehouse

573
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:30,010
and take a look.

Zhulong, Wuxian Sect, and Wei spies.

576
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:41,380
We have to investigate them all.

577
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,350
(Ma Sheng, Clerk of Internal Affairs Department, Siwencao Intelligence, the Shu State)
We have to investigate them all.

(Ma Sheng, Clerk of Internal Affairs Department, Siwencao Intelligence, the Shu State)

580
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:45,300
Instead of complaining,

581
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,860
(Liao Hui, Clerk of Internal Affairs Department, Siwencao Intelligence, the Shu State)
Instead of complaining,

(Liao Hui, Clerk of Internal Affairs Department, Siwencao Intelligence, the Shu State)

583
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:48,440
try to review more intelligence.
(Liao Hui, Clerk of Internal Affairs Department, Siwencao Intelligence, the Shu State)

584
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,040
You are new here.

585
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,340
Of course you are motivated.

586
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,730
Don't play the veteran card.

587
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:56,390
Go complain to Chief Xun if you dare.

588
00:37:59,370 --> 00:37:59,970
You know what?

589
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:01,700
I really need to ask Chief Xun for a leave.

590
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:04,210
Don't take it seriously.

591
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,360
I was kidding.

592
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,970
My wife sent me a letter from Yue City.

593
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:10,340
My father-in-law had a stroke.

594
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,420
I need to go home and check on him.

595
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,390
Is your wife alright?

596
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:19,260
She fell ill too due to excessive worrying.

597
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:21,230
She's been in bed for over 10 days.

598
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,050
Chief Xun is not available at the moment.

599
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,740
And he'll be sent to Yangping Pass today.

600
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:27,960
You need to get his approval when you have a chance.

601
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,550
It's fine.

602
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,620
Clerk Li said

603
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,400
Chief Xun would be back soon.

604
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,430
Oh, that's good.

605
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,290
Open the door.

606
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,480
Clerk Li, please.

607
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:30,830
Leave us.

608
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:36,970
Clerk Li, take a seat.

609
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,620
According to the rules,

610
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,940
before the codes are decoded and filed,

611
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,660
the codes must be kept secret.

612
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,140
These

613
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:14,110
are the code-cracking plates used exclusively by Baidi.

614
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,790
Based on the designated heavenly stems and earthly branches,

615
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:24,230
the plates' order will be changed accordingly.

616
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,320
So are the spaces that reveal

617
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,540
the words of the intelligence.

618
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,680
That way, it can prevent

619
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:30,830
an undercover agent from

620
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,180
duplicating the individual plate

621
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:33,770
and stealing the info.

622
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:38,620
Are the heavenly stems and earthly branches only designated before each delivery?

623
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:39,530
Yes.

624
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,920
Siwencao calls it the Encrypted Key.

625
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:46,050
On the wax stamp that seals the intelligence,

626
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,660
it would mark the words

627
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:51,030
such as directions and the three realms.

628
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,490
Outsiders wouldn't understand what they mean.

629
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:56,340
Only when the Encrypted Key and the codes

630
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:00,140
completely match can the codes be cracked.

631
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,280
You can give it a try.

632
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:10,080
The designated Encrypted Key

633
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,120
for this piece of intelligence

634
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,560
is “Heaven,

635
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:14,450
Man,

636
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:15,160
and North.”

637
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:35,250
It's not the Jieting's intelligence, isn't it?

638
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:37,790
Jieting's intelligence

639
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,350
has been filed in the Document Chamber.

640
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:41,990
If you want to review it, you need

641
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:43,650
Sun Ling's approval.

642
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,400
By the way,

643
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,360
Chief Xun

644
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,660
wants to study these plates.

645
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:53,730
May I take them out?

646
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:57,980
Normally,

647
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,520
it'd be a violation of rules.

648
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:04,820
But Siwencao has just established

649
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:06,330
a special investigation team for the Zhulong case, right?

650
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,420
Yes.

651
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,360
I'll borrow the plates in the name of the team.

652
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:13,700
I'll sign it.

653
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:15,380
Alright.

654
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:56,430
Chief Xun,

655
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,120
Clerk Li wants to see you.

656
00:42:58,460 --> 00:42:58,860
Oh,

657
00:42:59,360 --> 00:42:59,920
got it.

you're still suspecting me?

663

I swear to Heaven!

664
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:19,120
I wouldn't dare to do that!

665
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,150
Alright,

666
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:24,720
here is the latest intelligence.

667
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:29,140
Since Li Mao got Li Yan's support,

668
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:32,260
he's made a fuss about everything.

669
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:35,010
He even threatened Yin Ji to work for him.

670
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:35,940
This man

671
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,820
is harboring an evil intent.

672
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,610
Xun Xu, it's unwise of you to report to him.

673
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,320
My brother-in-law told you to stay out of the political strife.

Why don't you get it?

You're so blind.

678
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:52,910
Di Yue.

679
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:54,710
As spies,

680
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:57,010
they have to meet in this way.

681
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,920
I feel sorry for them.

682
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:01,120
But to gain Huang Yu's trust,

683
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,890
I have to say I admire

684
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:06,180
their mind-reading cooperation to deceive the enemy.

685
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:09,530
Their secret code

686
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,290
is only known to themselves,

687
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:14,020
not to a third soul.

688
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:16,470
Today's highlight

689
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:18,270
is Miss Liu Ying.

690
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:19,740
She turns out to be a Wei spy.

691
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:21,750
This is getting more and more interesting.

692
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,200
We're all blinded.

693
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:25,790
Who's the mysterious man talking to her?

694
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,620
How will Chen Gong and Di Yue

695
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:30,290
cooperate with each other

696
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:32,830
surrounded by Wuxian Sect's followers?

697
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:36,500
Does Li Miao have an ulterior motive

698
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,240
in the investigation of Zhulong?

699
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,130
So many surprises!

700
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:42,510
I have to keep listening!
