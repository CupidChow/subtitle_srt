Li Yan

7
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,640
is colluding with Wei

8
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,020
to cut off our supply.

9
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,509
I suggest

10
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,030
we nip it

11
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,790
in the bud.

12
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,300
It's too early

13
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,900
and he'll have millions of ways to spin it.

14
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,340
If he slips out,

15
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,020
all of us will be doomed.

16
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,450
The trap has been laid.

17
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,890
We need to push him

18
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,240
to make the move himself.

19
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,360
Have we notified General Wei?

20
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,680
We have.

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,160
We'll deliver the provisions across the river first.

22
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,170
General Wei has sent in others

23
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,630
to raid Wuxian Sect's camp.

24
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,270
Good!

25
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,720
If the provisions are safe,

26
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,190
we can be at ease.

Yes?

Is Huang Yu still waiting for your news?

30
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,440
Let him wait.

31

wipe out Huang Yu

34
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,560
and Wuxian Sect.

35
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:00,890

There's someone inside!

38
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,520
Go get the key!

39
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,500
Commandant Cheng has it.

40
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,130
Go ask him!

41
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:05,740
Yes.

42
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,149
Is he here with the key?

43
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:20,950
Still waiting.

44
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:21,700
Do something!

45
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,320
Go rush him!

46
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,180
Yes.

47
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,710
What's going on inside?

48
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,280

Yes!

52

You two, go!

53
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,450
Yes!

54
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:33,380

55
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:34,380

Anything from Chen Gong?

61
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:45,710
Clerk Chen said

62
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,230
once Wei Yan's force is on the river,

63
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,150
he'll destroy the dam immediately.

64
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,450

His Majesty is calling Prime Minister back

71
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,440
and giving you full authority to deal with Wu.

72
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,280
Fantastic!

73
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,480
General!

74
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,980
How dare you break in

75
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,290
on our private meeting!

76
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,340
General,

77
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,220
your study in the villa is on fire.

78
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,610
It's urgent.

79
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,020
What?

80
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,790
Your study is burning.

81

(Upstream of the Mian River, Border of the Shu State)

82

Leader,

83
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,110
the dam is almost done.

84
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,460
We'll soon be ready, too.

85
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:38,780
Leader,

86
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,190
Zhulong has fired the signal.

87
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:44,960
Move it.

88
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:45,890
Go!

89
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,500
Bring that over here!

90
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,790
Hurry!

91
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,580
Do it!

92
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,380
Retreat! Pull back!

93
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,250
Retreat! Pull back!

94
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:03,950
Pull back!

95
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,180
Leader,

96
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,970
the Shu Army knew we were coming.

97
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,280
We're besieged.

98
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,660
Let's go!

99
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:42,580
Charge!

100
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,300
Bring it on!

101
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,480
Leader,

102
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,030
let's go!

103
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:46,020
Run!

104
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,740
Let's go, Leader!

105
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:48,560
Come on!

106
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,100
We'll be in Wei

107
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,940
after that mountain.

108
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,260
Chen Gong!

109
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,690
Senior Huang,

110
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:35,070
what's taking you so long?

111
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,480
I knew you defecting from the Shu State

112
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,940
to Guo Huai

113
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,760
is all but an act!

114
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,960
Of course.

115
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,500
Those pigs of Wei

116
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,770
want me, Baidi, to be their lackey?

117
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:51,720
In their dreams.

118
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,810
Gentlemen,

119
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,200
even if we'll die

120
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,330
today,

121
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,620
we must

122
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,500
kill that rat first!

123
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:20,020
Kill them all!

124
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,920
Remember this sword?

125
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,220
You're still keeping

126
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,830
that tramp's weapon?

127
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,800
She took

128
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,560
the elixir

129
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,330
and died a horrible death.

130
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,300
What a shame!

131
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,310
Pity, you didn't see how brilliant the death was.

132
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,740
I vowed

133
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,700
that I'd finish you with this sword.

134
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,060
Bring in your help.

135
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,080
You alone aren't my match.

136
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,710
Yue...

137
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,720
Yue,

138
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,740
I avenged your murder.

139
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:20,700
Finally, you can rest in peace.

140
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:12,900
General,

141
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,410
the three lines of defense outside were tight.

142
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,570
Guards came in to check every few hours, too.

143
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:18,760
According to our investigation,

144
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,630
someone sneaked in

145
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,050
and used kerosene to make the fire.

146
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,350
However,

147
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,330
we only found Ying'er's body.

148
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:26,620
There's no sign of Liu Ying.

149
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,230
Put the city under lockdown

150
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,850
and a bounty of 1,000 taels of gold on her.

151
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:44,930
Yes, sir.

152
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,840
Set out now

153
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,720
to Jiangzhou.

154
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,640
Call back

155
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:55,860
the Garrison Battalion there.

156
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,230
All of them?

157
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,060
Yes.

158
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:00,840
Pull back all 5,000 crack troops.

159
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,550
Leave no one there.

160
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,310
Yes, sir!

161
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,100
The downpour has finally stopped.

162
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,660
(Commandant Cheng Fan at Yangping Pass, the Shu State)
The downpour has finally stopped.

163
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:18,710
(Commandant Cheng Fan at Yangping Pass, the Shu State)

164
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:21,410
General Wei should've crossed the river by now.
(Commandant Cheng Fan at Yangping Pass, the Shu State)

165
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,500
We've made the delivery

166
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:24,670
and our job is done.

167
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,280
That said,

168
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:29,330
I can't stop worrying

169
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,780
until the provisions arrive at the front.

170
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:32,880
Commandant Cheng Fan,

171
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,320
you've been working day and night for days.

172
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,430
Tonight,

173
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,080
just relax,

174
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,420
drink as much as you can

175
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,660
and get a good night's sleep.

176
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,560
Cheers!

177
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,530
The Northern Expedition will take at least one year.

178
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,220
There's no time to rest.

179
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,290
-General Ma.
-General Ma.

180
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:57,970
What are you doing?

181
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:58,760
Hu Zhong,

182
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,220
you work with Li Yan

183
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,200
to help Wei cut off our supply

184
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:06,220
and halt the Northern Expedition.

185
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,859
How do you plead?

186
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,380
Ma Dai,

187
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,910
you signed the proposal to clean the house, too.

188
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,970
I'm following His Majesty's order.

189
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,260
I'm innocent and shall be rewarded!

190
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,960
Do you have His Majesty's edict?

191
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,190
Yang Yi?

192
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,230
You set me up!

193
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,839
Yang Yi,

194
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,030
I curse you!

195
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:31,210
Take him away.

196
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:33,830
Let me go!

197
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,580
Take him away!

198
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,140
(Sanguan Pass)

199
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,850
Let's go.

200
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,220
Make the last move

201
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,180
in Nanzheng.

202
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,100
Check again.

203
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:52,610
Yes, sir.

204
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,760
Check again.

205
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:57,750
General!

206
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,100
Chen Gong!

207
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,610
Finally! There you are!

208
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,380
How did it go at Sanguan Pass?

209
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,300
The dam burst.

210
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,220
Both the provisions and the troops drowned.

211
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,250
We made it.

212
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,840
Sir,

213
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,700
is there a problem?

214
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,210
Feng Ying

215
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,410
is likely to be a Wei spy.

216
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,770
Liu Ying

217
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,700
burned my study.

218
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:26,690
What? But she's your...

219
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:29,940
She's a Wei spy through and through!

220
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,590
That edict was stored in there.

221
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,400
She destroyed it

222
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,940
only to

223
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:42,170
burn all my bridges.

224
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,260
Feng Ying was

225
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,230
plotting against me

226
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,980
when he planted her near me.

227
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,240
Sir,

228
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,430
if their identities are confirmed,

229
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,700
clearly,

230
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,170
Wei is using you

231
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:57,850
to destroy the Shu Army once and for all.

232
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,400
That way,

233
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,830
they fooled both of us.

234
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:03,740
Sir,

235
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,500
despite their trick,

236
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,770
this whole thing

237
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,110
might not end up too bad.

238
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,700
That'd be true four hours ago.

239
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,180
But now...

240
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,130
not anymore.

241
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,740
Not anymore.

242
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,310
The endgame is getting closer.

243
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:51,530
Chen Gong can't be exposed.

244
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,790
We must keep him out of it.

245
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,430
Shall we act now?

246
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,310
Wait one more hour.

247
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:09,290
I believe

248
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,230
the sooner the better.

249
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,590
It's almost impossible to proceed in force

250
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:16,640
behind Li Yan's back.

251
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,280
The Garrison Battalion is

252
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,610
his elite force.

253
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:22,990
There isn't

254
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,540
much chance of winning against them.

255
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,870
If he sends in troops,

256
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,180
that'll be an act of rebellion.

257
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:37,770
He wouldn't dare.

258
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,940
The stakes are too high.

259
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,500
A civil war will not only

260
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,450
cost Li Yan's men,

261
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,590
but also civilians in Nanzheng

262
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,430
and even the stability of Hanzhong.

263
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,470
I hate to resort to force

264
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,090
but we have to press him hard enough.

265
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:02,910
I see.

266
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:06,110
Guards!

267
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,170
We must take action now.

268
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,240
It's too late to come back.

269
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,170
You've used your tally

270
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,370
to bring in troops from Jiangzhou.

271
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,860
Three batches of provisions have been sent there

272
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,060
from Mount Dingjun at your order.

273
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,580
Once the Northern Expedition goes south,

274
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:18,970
we can still make this work.

275
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:20,550
But the edict is gone.

276
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:21,940
If our operation fails,

277
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,280
I'll have to

278
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,850
meet my death!

279
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:28,910
Master,

280
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,190
it doesn't have to fail.

281
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:33,940
Report!

282
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:37,860
General.

283
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:38,620
What is it?

284
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,410
General Ma is back.

285
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,510
A fighting force has been assembled in Prefect's Mansion.

286
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:43,590
Check again.

287
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,220
Yes, sir!

288
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:50,040
My biggest fear

289
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,260
isn't Feng Ying's identity.

290
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:52,710
I know.

291
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,150
You fear

292
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,550
that he and Yang Yi are in cahoots.

293
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,050
In that case,

294
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:58,800
I...

295
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,650
I won't stand a chance!

296
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,000
Calm down, sir. It's not that bad.

297
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,250
Feng Ying might be a fence-sitter,

298
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,410
but he did betray Prime Minister and Yang Yi.

299
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:09,740
I'm sure

300
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,480
of it.

301
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,400
No doubt.

302
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,550
But the evidence...

303
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:16,860
the evidence is gone.

304
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:21,070
The proposal was lost in the fire, too.

305
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,770
Ma Dai's sudden return

306
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,880
can't be a clearer sign.

307
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,100
Yang Yi

308
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,590
baited the trap with Feng Ying

309
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,830
to lure us in.

310
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,040
Report!

311
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,980
General Ma has taken over

312
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,670
our troops on guard.

313
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:41,200
All four gates of the city are lost.

314
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,890
They've surrounded your camp

315
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,910
and asked us to step back and drop the weapons.

316
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,480
Pass my order!

317
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,320
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

318
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,630
Gather all the crack troops.

319
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,530
Yes, sir!

320
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,260
You,

321
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:00,090
go to Ma Dai.

322
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:00,930
Tell him,

323
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:02,760
whoever steps into my sector

324
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:03,910
will be killed!

325
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,190
Yes, sir!

326
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,520
You four, follow me!

327
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,220
Yes, sir!

328
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,100
Order!

329
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:37,620
Yes, sir.

330
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,710
Have two squads in the back.

331
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:40,960
Seal off every exit!

332
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,030
Yes, sir!

333
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:42,820
Split up!

334
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:25,590
Li Yan ordered to cordon off the area

335
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:27,700
while General Ma had disarmed his men

336
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:30,820
and occupied all four gates of the city.

337
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:33,260
Now, Nanzheng is isolated.

338
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,520
Report!

339
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,280
We've taken all four gates of the city

340
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:39,840
and surrounded Li Yan's camp.

341
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:41,520
His villa is a bit problematic, though.

342
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,140
The Garrison Battalion camped outside

343
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,110
has terminated the expedition from Jiangzhou

344
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,140
and turned to the West Gate of Nanzheng.

345
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,540
General Ma has besieged Li Yan's camp

346
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,680
while sending another team to the south of the city.

347
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,690
Li Yan's villa is there.

348
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:01,300
What's General Ma doing?

349
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:03,780
Staging a revolt?

350
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,560
The villa overlooking the city in the south

351
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,140
used to belong to the Agency.

352
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,450
It's well-fortified

353
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,630
and heavily guarded.

354
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,690
Li Yan keeps ten crossbows in his camp

355
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,670
and another 80 of various types

356
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,530
all in his villa.

357
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,770
If we try to break in,

358
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,270
they'll cause us heavy casualties.

359
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,590
Li Yan has deployed

360
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,600
all his guards here

361
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,390
against General Ma.

362
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:29,120
The Garrison Battalion

363
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,230
answering directly to him

364
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,750
is moving fast.

365
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,220
Once breaking into the West Gate,

366
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:37,370
they'll encircle

367
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:39,260
General Ma's force.

368
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:41,890
Chief Yang.

369
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,860
Chief Yang!

370
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:47,490
Calm down.

371
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:48,940
We'll wait.

372
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,300
Are they engaged?

373
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:53,820
Go!

374
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,660
Go, go, go!

375
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,220
Not yet. Still pitting against each other.

376
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:01,520
But the Garrison Battalion is on the move.

377
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,100
Where's Clerk Chen?

378
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,140
In Li Yan's villa.

379
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:08,380
Chief Pei,

380
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:10,060
three streams of smoke rose from the South Peak outside.

381
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,490
Where at?

382
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:12,780
Right here.

383
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:16,180
That looks like

384
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,480
our department's signal.

385
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:19,980
Chief Xun.

386
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:21,940
It's him! It's Chief Xun!

387
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,340
Report!

388
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,010
General,

389
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:28,400
the Garrison Battalion is in position.

390
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,370
Shall we attack?

391
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:31,880
General,

392
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:33,810
Ma Dai's force is outside.

393
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:34,920
We're able to

394
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,780
battle them for four to six hours.

395
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,710
Meanwhile, the Garrison Battalion will break in

396
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,240
and stab them in the back.

397
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,600
Together, we'll crush them.

398
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,360
General!

399
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:44,090
Give the order, General!

400
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:44,850
Get out.

401
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:45,590
Battle it out, General!

402
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,230
General!

403
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,530
Get out!

404
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,680
You stay with me.

405
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:01,820
Yes, sir.

406
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:09,060
Once going to war,

407
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:12,680
we'll become rebels.

408
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:14,410
Master,

409
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,810
what concerns me more is

410
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,500
Hu Zhong still hasn't come back

411
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:20,460
after finishing his task.

412
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:23,010
It's possible

413
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:25,010
that he's caught by Yang Yi and Ma Dai.

414
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,090
If...

415
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:30,170
If he gives your entire plan away...

416
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,380
I've thought about that,

417
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,020
and...

418
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,720
and I'm not sure what to do.

419
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,170
Seeing

420
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:53,400
that Ma Dai

421
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,690
is sending troops in

422
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,230
against you,

423
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,090
does that mean...?

424
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,940
Does that mean someone is backing him up?

425
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,250
Are you saying

426
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,100
Zhuge Liang has given him the order?

427
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:18,290
Otherwise, he wouldn't dare

428
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,940
to rise in rebellion.

429
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,760
Also, he and Yang Yi's reports

430
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:27,470
are probably on their way to Chengdu

431
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:31,340
to accuse you of treason.

432
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,950
Hu Zhong's testimony

433
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:35,960
will be solid evidence.

434
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,670
If so,

435
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,050
we'll be in grave danger, Master.

436
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:44,490
Then...

437
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,380
what should I do

438
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:49,380
under this circumstance?

439
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,640
Master,

440
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:56,250
the Garrison Battalion cannot break in.

441
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,210
Do not use force,

442
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,340
or you'll be proven guilty.

443
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:03,730
The alternative is

444
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,380
that you go back to Chengdu immediately

445
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,350
and explain everything

446
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,340
to His Majesty.

447
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,340
With your return,

448
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:11,380
all their charges against you

449
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,470
will certainly

450
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,020
go away.

451
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:20,060
Here's Nanzheng.

452
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:21,310
Here's Chengdu.

453
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:23,010
The direct route in between

454
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,480
must be controlled by Yang Yi and Ma Dai,

455
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,210
but they don't know

456
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:31,610
we can first go to Hancheng

457
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,020
and Jiangzhou

458
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,700
to your eldest son's place.

459
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,330
Then we can get to Chengdu

460
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,940
from there.

461
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,570
The gates are closed.

462
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,610
I can't get out.

463
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,670
We won't use the gates.

464
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:53,250
This route

465
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,140
belongs to the Agency.

466
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,100
There's no exit,

467
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,220
but you can climb down the wall.

468
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,050
That's not pretty

469
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,540
but safe.

470
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,740
Once I'm gone,

471
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,380
the troops will be leaderless.

472
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:10,620
When Ma Dai launches the attack,

473
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,940
without the Garrison Battalion's support,

474
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:19,100
we can only hold for one hour at most.

475
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:22,010
Even if I leave alone,

476
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:25,590
Ma Dai will soon

477
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,220
catch up with me.

478
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,620
Master, give me your tally.

479
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:35,220
I'll buy you six hours.

480
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,300
After that,

481
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,380
the rough tracks alone

482
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:40,970
will stop Yang Yi and Ma Dai

483
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:43,140
from finding you.

484
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,030
Move, move!

485
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:45,510
Go!

486
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,650
Hurry up!

487
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,900
Go, go, go!

488
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,570
(General Who Pacifies the North)

489
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:03,960
(Cavalry General Li Yan)

490
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,730
The Garrison Battalion is outside the West Gate.

491
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:19,560
They'll strike anytime.

492
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,640
This is our best chance to attack.

493
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:24,980
No.

494
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:26,610
No attacks.

495
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:27,710
Chief Yang,

496
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:31,620
the Garrison Battalion is Li Yan's trump card.

497
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,100
If they charge in,

498
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:34,610
we'll be attacked front and rear!

499
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:35,850
I know!

500
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:37,850
What are we still waiting for?

501
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,540
We wait for Li Yan to leave,

502
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:43,860
to get out.

503
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,240
Master,

504
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,730
we're running out of time.

505
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,300
Nanzheng is in a dire situation.

506
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:57,930
Even if you stay,

507
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:00,110
even if you win

508
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,540
and capture Yang Yi and Ma Dai,

509
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,180
Prime Minister will soon know it

510
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,200
and march back towards Hanzhong

511
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,540
with his 100,000-strong troops.

512
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:07,790
Then what?

513
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:12,290
Your son is in Jiangzhou and able to protect you.

514
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,000
Either

515
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:16,780
go from there to Chengdu to tell His Majesty the truth,

516
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,520
or

517
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,230
stay there and your safety is guaranteed.

518
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,469
That's your best option.

519
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:24,820
Even if the troops can hold for

520
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,050
six hours under your command,

521
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:32,060
you'll be seized

522
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:36,540
by Ma Dai and Yang Yi eventually

523
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:41,489
and branded as a rebel.

524
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,570
It's worth it.

525
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,690
As long as you're safe,

526
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,409
you will

527
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,110
clear my name.

528
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:01,740
Chen Gong,

529
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:07,860
throughout my life,

530
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:11,370
I've been caught in a dead end twice.

531
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,230
First, your father saved me and now, you.

532
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,680
Master,

533
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,740
you gave me my second life.

534
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,540
That's enough.

535
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,140
Just go.

536
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:05,430
Over there!

537
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,430
Go!

538
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:38,290
Gee!

539
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:41,510
Gee!

540
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,330
(General Who Pacifies the North)

541
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,740
Chief Xun.

542
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:08,170
Chief Xun.

543
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:16,720
I got you.

544
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:24,890
Where's Chen Gong?

545
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:46,810
Yang Yi!

546
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:50,030
Yang Yi, you rat!

547
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,850
I'll kill you!

548
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:53,210
I'll kill you!

549
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,140
Li Yan's villa is practically

550
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,180
a treasure house.

551
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:06,520
Yes.

552
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,380
Chen Gong,

553
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:14,420
you've managed to stop a war.

554
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:24,060
Now that the routes to Chengdu are all cut off,

555
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:25,900
Li Yan can only take your advice

556
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:27,820
to go to Hancheng

557
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:29,400
and make a detour in the south to Jiangzhou.

558
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,020
Ma Dai is right behind him.

559
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,570
It all

560
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,860
thanks to you.

561
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,540
He was afraid

562
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,100
because he set Prime Minister up first.

563
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,050
He thought General Ma

564
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,740
was authorized by Prime Minister

565
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:49,690
to charge in

566
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,730
with his troops

567
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,850
and didn't dare to battle them head-on.

568
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:55,410
He had no choice

569
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,560
but to stick to my plan.

570
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,960
Guo Huai believes you're one of them

571
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,370
but he has no idea

572
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,160
that all that he's done for the Qingping Plan

573
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:10,140
is in our favor.

574
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:12,740
Chen Gong,

575
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,990
you'll be

576
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,980
the most secret weapon of Shu.

577
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,900
Those who know your real identity

578
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:21,850
have all been silenced.

579
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,460
You'll play a significant role

580
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:27,720
in our decisive battle against Wei.

581
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,350
There's one thing

582
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,260
I agree with Guo Huai

583
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,410
that in this line of business, you...

584
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:37,660
Chief!

585
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,850
Let me finish.

586
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,360
In this line of business,

587
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,780
you'll become one of a kind.

588
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,600
What is it?

589
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,620
Li Yan's guards have all been disarmed.

590
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,360
The Garrison Battalion has retreated, awaiting orders.

591
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:53,780
But...

592
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,330
Go on. It's fine.

593
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,170
The Agency has sent people over,

594
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,180
headed by Yin Ji and Xun Xu,

595
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:03,990
to bring

596
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:05,960
Clerk Chen back.

597
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:14,130
Keep them outside.

598
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:15,350
Yes, sir.

599
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,550
Xun Xu is still alive?

600
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:28,650
Chief Xun, Chief Yin,

601
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:30,220
one more minute, please.

602
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,630
Are Chief Yang

603
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:33,840
and Clerk Chen inside?

604
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:35,180
They are.

605
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:37,640
Chief Yang doesn't want to be disturbed.

606
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:38,740
I demand to see him.

607
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:40,370
Chief Xun,

608
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,260
don't make this hard for me.

609
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,420
Commandant Cheng Fan,

610
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,250
Yang Yi is only

611
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,040
Prime Minister's personal assistant

612
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:49,790
while I am

613
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,420
a court official

614
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:54,730
hunting a suspect of espionage.

615
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,690
Why are you trying to stop me?

616
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,180
Chief Xun!

617
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:03,810
Don't move!

618
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:11,860
I meant...

619
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,990
I meant to keep Xun Xu there

620
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,020
and tell him everything

621
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,890
after we finished.

622
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:23,220
Somehow,

623
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,490
he got out.

624
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:26,930
Chen Gong,

625
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:30,930
your only weakness is

626
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,910
that soft heart of yours!

627
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:33,970
I...

628
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:35,720
I...

629
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,590
I couldn't kill Xun Xu.

630
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,630
This isn't about you

631
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,530
but the restoration of Han!

632
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:43,720
Nothing could make me do it.

633
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:46,360
My wife, Di Yue,

634
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,780
already died for our state.

635
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,240
Xun Xu is her only cousin.

636
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:51,400
I couldn't kill him even for her!

637
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:01,410
What now?

638
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:03,480
What are you going to do?

639
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,020
If you give yourself away,

640
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:08,280
it'll ruin our entire plan.

641
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,050
Li Yan will get away with it.

642
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:11,760
Everyone involved in this

643
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,890
will be put in harm's way,

644
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:13,840
Ma Dai and I included!

645
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,230
Feng Ying will die for nothing!

646
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:24,820
There's another way.

647
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:36,660
Xun Xu,

648
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:38,810
you always know what's important.

649
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:41,260
Chief Yang is doing what he has to do.

650
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,140
-Don't...
-Commandants of the Agency!

651
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:43,990
Yes, sir!

652
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,740
Break in to seize the suspect!

653
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:47,660
Yes, sir!

654
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,020
Go!

655
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:50,530
Chief Xun!

656
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:15,130
(The 24 Strategies of War, The Wind Blows from Longxi)
(Intelligence Agency in Longxi)

657
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:18,180
(The Twenty-third Strategy To Catch the Bandits, First Capture their Leader)

658
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,120
Guys,

659
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:21,090
we're coming to an end!

660
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:24,500
To complete Chen Gong's task

661
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:25,970
and capture Li Yan,

662
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,950
Liu Ying burned his edict

663
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,810
and escaped at night.

664
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:34,500
Yang Yi and Chen Gong are still working

665
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:36,380
to nail Li Yan down

666
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,220
to rebellion.

667
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:39,670
Now,

668
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:42,380
Li Yan is really in a dire situation.

669
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,180
At this time,

670
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:45,650
Chen Gong gave him an alternative.

671
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,760
Go back

672
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,040
to Chengdu immediately

673
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,110
and explain everything

674
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,020
to His Majesty.

675
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,810
He talked Li Yan into going to Chengdu

676
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:56,080
through Hancheng to defend himself before His Majesty.

677
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:59,220
To make sure the provisions arrive at the front,

678
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,360
Chen Gong ambushed Wuxian Sect.

679
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:02,560
He challenged Huang Yu to a duel

680
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:04,020
and killed him

681
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:06,380
with his wife Di Yue's sword

682
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:08,470
to avenger her murder.

683
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,360
Seeing him with that sword in the end

684
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:12,450
really breaks my heart!

685
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:14,780
Xun Xu is really something!

686
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:16,780
As soon as he dug his way

687
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:17,610
out of the cave,

688
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,630
he led the team to Li Yan's place

689
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,180
to arrest Chen Gong.

690
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:22,690
Will the two brothers

691
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:24,660
end up as enemies?

692
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,260
What will happen to Li Yan?

693
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,440
Will he be able to see His Majesty

694
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:30,750
and prove himself innocent?

695
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:32,560
What's awaiting Chen Gong?

696
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:33,950
Stay tuned.

697
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:36,220
I'll use my spy skills to find out.
