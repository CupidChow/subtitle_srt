saying that another right-hand man will be sent to Tianshui.

86
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,470
I didn't expect that it'd be you.

87
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,560
So you mean

88
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,730
I'm not worthy of that title?

89
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:18,399
No, I didn't mean that.

Frankly speaking,

92
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,100
it's not

93
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,210
an easy task for me.

94
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,250
You used to serve the water forces in Jingzhou.

95
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,230
How could the field work be hard for you?

96
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,220
It's different.

97
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,560
On the battlefield, you can fight the enemies head-on.

98
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,190
Unlike Siwencao,

99
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,010
everything's done based on assumption.

100
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,590
But come to think of it,

101
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,570
you've been working in the Internal Affairs Department

102

in charge of the counterintelligence within the state.

103
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,680
Why did they send you this time?

104
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,320
I'm not sure.

105
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:48,600
Maybe

106
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,260
Clerk Feng dislikes me.

107
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,940
You are fooling me.

108
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,680
I'll stop asking then.

109
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,310
Anyway, Clerk Feng asked me

110
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,890
to fully support you.

111
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,630
Let me know if you need anything.

112
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:01,690

114
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:03,480
to go with me.

115
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,950
I've had them ready.

116

I don't mind his long-lasting mission.

150
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,970
But why did you send my father

151

to collect information about Liu Bei?

152
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,870

that matters the most in this world?

So I think the future of our state matters the most.

You are wrong.

What matters the most

158
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,630
is people.

159
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,550
It's been 18 years since Dong Zhuo entered Chang'an,

160
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,930
and over the years, thousands of people died.

If the people are all gone,

163
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,610
what's the point of defending the country?

164
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,570
I asked your father to collect information about Liu Bei

165
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:31,810
because

166
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,480
he's a righteous man.

167
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,270
And such person

168
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,190
is exactly what we need in this turbulent era.

169
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,940
Is Liu Bei

170
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:45,040
really able to bring peace to the world?

171
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,020
With my assistance,

172
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,300
I'm sure

173
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:53,420
he can.

174
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,020
You can let you, and me,

175
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,940
and them,

176
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,840
and all the people in the world

177
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,340
live a life

178
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:05,900
with plenty of food

179
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:07,700
and a roof over our heads.

180
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,420
Xun Xu,

181
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:12,740
remember

182
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,340
that every single soul on earth

183
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,800
is precious.

184
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:19,790
You must cherish them.

185
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,540
Have you found out anything

186
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,320
about the Wei spy?

187
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,659
There truly is

188
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,679
a Wei spy

189
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,630
lurking in our key department.

190
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:39,490
His target is Siwencao, right?

191
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:40,850
Yes.

192
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:42,780
But we don't

193
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,130
have any lead so far.

194
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,190
Find out who he is as soon as possible.

195
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,310
It's my biggest concern.

196
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,540
Understood.

197
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,680
How many people knew

198
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,140
Baidi's intelligence regarding Jieting?

199
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,170
Quite a few.

200
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,740
We've investigated within our agency.

201
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,020
Here's what we think.

202
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,080
As soon as Baidi got Zhang He's battle plan,

203
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,500
he sent a Military Messenger

204
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,130
to deliver the info immediately,

205
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,420
but the messenger was found out

206
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,480
by Mi Chong, Chancellor

207
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,450
of the Military Intelligence Agency of Wei.

208
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,300
Mi Chong sent a crack unit right away

209
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,250
to intercept the messenger,

210
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,870
who was ambushed

211
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,370
and in danger.

212
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,340
Luckily,

213
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,880
despite the trouble,

214
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,390
before he died, the messenger still managed

215
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:01,730
to deliver the info to Yang Yi.

216
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,380
However,

217
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,720
Baidi's intelligence was written

218
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,050
in special code,

219
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:08,870
and the code-cracking plate

220
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,250
has been kept

221
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,430
by Clerk Feng.

222
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,460
The code is quite complicated.

223
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,630
It can't be cracked

224
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,980
without the plate.

225
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,260
So...

226
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:18,490
Hmm.

227
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,980
So you mean

228
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,210
if Baidi is innocent,

229
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,670
Clerk Feng must be a suspect.

230
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,180
Hey,

231
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:27,920
I didn't say that.

232
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,500
You just said it.

233
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:29,490
I didn't.

234
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:32,110
Stop messing with me, will you?

235
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:33,390
Here.

236
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,060
Xun Xu.

237
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,710
The Wei border is right up front.

238
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,610
There's a pass at the exit of Xiegu Valley.

239
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:39,980
The team you asked for

240
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,260
is waiting for you behind the pass.

241
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:42,820
Good.

242
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,620
Take good care.

243
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,830
(Chengdu, the Shu State)

it's time.

288
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,830
Is it true that Baidi turned?

289
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:49,930
Li Miao, the Adjutant of the Prime Minister, got scolded.

(Hu Zhong, Adjutant to Commander-in-chief of Shu)

293
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,280
Good.

294
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,430
This is a great opportunity.

295
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,260
His Majesty is still too young and inexperienced

296
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,740
to confront the Prime Minster.

297
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,100
The court is completely in Zhuge Liang's control.

298
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:02,940
His power is growing,

299
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,140
and he's assisted by a great number of underlings like Yang Yi.

300
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,220
If you insists on impeaching him,

301
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,540
I'm afraid it'll cause trouble to you.

302
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,900
Impeaching Zhuge Liang

303
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,380
is not the point.

304
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:12,950
Our goal is

305
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,070
to take control over Siwencao.

306
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:14,990
We can't miss this chance.

Prime Minister,

308
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,240
Li Yan has been reaching out

309
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,000
to the eminent clans

310
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,840
in Jingzhou and Xichuan,

311
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,210
plotting to impeach you.

312
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,070
"For the ideal that I hold dear to my heart,

313
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,130
I'd not regret

314
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,110
a thousand times to die."

315
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,800
You've read

316
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Qu Yuan's The Lament

317
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:55,770
and the Nine Pieces, right?

318
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,980
Though Qu Yuan was loyal,

319
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,800
he was still framed by corrupt noblemen.

320
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,090
Prime Minister, you've got to be careful.

321
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,220
Li Yan will definitely take this chance

322
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,530
and use the false intelligence incident

323
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,890
and the infiltration of the Wei spy as an excuse

324
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,680
to get rid of dissidents

325
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,890
so that

326
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,720
-he can seize the power...
-Yang Yi,

327
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,340
go and ask Feng Ying

328
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,910
to find out who the Wei spy is as soon as possible,

329
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,460
and investigate within the agency.

330
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:26,860
Aye.

331
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,060
(The Gate of Tianshui, the Wei State)

332
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,410
I came from Yongzhou.

333
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,020
I'm the Chief Guard

334
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,090
of Commander Guo Huai's Mansion.

335
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:43,700
Chief Guard Jin.

336
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:44,860
Nice to meet you.

337
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,130
I'm here for a secret mission.

338
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,640
It hasn't been long since Tianshui was retrieved.

339
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,300
The Governor orders to investigate the Shu spy.

340
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,820
Chief Guard Jin, please do understand.

341
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,540
-So…
-It's fine.

342
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,540
No problem.

343
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:05,370
They are free to go.

344
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,730
(The Military Intelligence Agency of Wei)
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

345
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:14,640
Chancellor Mi, you still think
(The Military Intelligence Agency of Wei)
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

346
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:14,990
Chancellor Mi, you still think

347
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:15,500
(Chancellor of the Tianshui Military Intelligence Agency of Wei)
(Mi Chong)

348
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:15,170
(Mi Chong)
Chancellor Mi, you still think

349
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:14,990
(Mi Chong)

350
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,070
that Baidi
(Chancellor of the Tianshui Military Intelligence Agency of Wei)
(Mi Chong)

351
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:16,200
(Chancellor of the Tianshui Military Intelligence Agency of Wei)
(Mi Chong)

352
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,370
has something to do with Recorder Chen?
(Chancellor of the Tianshui Military Intelligence Agency of Wei)
(Mi Chong)

353
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,430
(Chancellor of the Tianshui Military Intelligence Agency of Wei)
(Mi Chong)

354
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:20,870
Chancellor Mi?

355
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,070
Have you found out anything about the hoof marks?

356
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,400
It's been confirmed that it wasn't a military horse.

357
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,300
Military horse should have horseshoe nails.

358
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,800
But the marks show that this horse doesn't.

359
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,670
So, it must be a civilian's horse.

360
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,180
The day when the intelligence was stolen,

361
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,600
there were all military horses within five-kilometer radius

362
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,640
surrounding the Commander's camp.

363
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:37,440
Show me the map of the camp.

364
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,620
This is where

365
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,810
the fire started on that day. And where was the horse?

366
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,060
In the woods at the southwest corner of the camp.

367
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,790
We found the hoof marks

368
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,850
on this path.

369
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:50,530
But

370
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,010
none of them was clear.

371
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,700
By all means,

372
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,690
find a clear hoof mark.

373
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,800
Look carefully.

374
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,000
There's got to be one.

375
00:14:59,130 --> 00:14:59,660
Aye.

376
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,340
On the day of fire,

377
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,240
Chen Gong was the only one

378
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,460
who rode a civilian's horse to the camp.

379
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,460
But what the Governor said

380
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,600
also makes sense.

381
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,580
All the people were detained for seven days

382
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,260
before they were set free.

383
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,980
Even if Recorder Chen got the intelligence,

384
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,560
he couldn't send it out.

385
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,780
That's why we need to find the horse.

386
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,260
He must've had a helper.

387
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,050
And I believe

388
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,670
that the helper was the one

389
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,080
who showed up in the tavern.

390
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,150
Well,

391
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:28,900
it's all my fault.

392
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:29,960
I didn't see his face clearly.

393
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,660
Put the words out first.

394
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,990
The Shu spy may give

395
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,210
himself away under the pressure.

396
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,180
Aye.

397
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,180
If I'm right,

398
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,780
you must be Chen Gong,

399
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:52,570
Recorder Chen, right?

400
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:54,980
Yes, I am.

401
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,380
General, you are...

402
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,830
I'm Jin,

403
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,370
the Chief Guard

404
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,220
to Commander Guo Huai,

405
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,140
the Regional Inspector in Yongzhou.

406
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,180
Under his command,

407
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,430
I'm here to invite you

408
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:06,650
to the Commander's place

409
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,380
for a meeting.

410
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,140
I'm just

411
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,080
an insignificant Recorder

412
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,260
to the Governor Guo Gang.

413
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,530
I wonder why

414
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,460
the Commander

415
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,630
wants to meet me?

416
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,570
That,

417
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,660
I'm not quite sure.

418
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:09,020
After him.

419
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,260
Catch him alive.

420
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,140
-Aye.
-Aye.

421
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,050
How dare you run?

422
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:36,920
Dig a hole.

423
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,300
A deep one.

424
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,320
(The Imperial Palace)
(Chengdu, the Shu State)

425
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:48,460
Eunuch Huang,

426
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:49,840
what did His Majesty say?

427
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:50,960
His Majesty

428
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:51,990
is feeling under the weather.

429
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:52,690
He doesn't want to meet anybody.

430
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:55,960
Did His Majesty see the secret memorial

431
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,220
regarding impeaching Zhuge Liang jointly signed by the officials?

432
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,420
He read it.

433
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,260
What did he say?

434
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,500
His Majesty said,

435
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,020
"General Li has been supporting my reign

436
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,060
and serving me with whole heart

437
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,230
since the Late King passed away.

438
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,500
I don't want him to fight his fellow official

439
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,680
and cause internal conflicts."

440
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,530
I also have something important about the military situation to report.

441
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,850
I need to talk to His Majesty in person.

442
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,640
You need to...

443
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:18,680
His Majesty is already

444
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,030
aware of the fact that a Wei spy

445
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:21,020
has infiltrated

446
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,130
into Siwencao.

447
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,730
He has asked the secretary to draft out an edict

448
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:25,530
to have you

449
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,940
take over Siwencao

450
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,200
and move to Nanzheng.

451
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,660
I see.

452
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:39,490
That's great.

453
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,030
It's just as what you wished, General.

454
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,350
Siwencao is completely under Yang Yi's control,

455
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,300
and he's got eyes and ears everywhere.

456
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,710
Whatever you do,

457
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,780
he'd know right away.

458
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,480
It puts us in such a difficult position.

459
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,500
Right.

460
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,060
His Majesty knows

461
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,300
the Jieting's false intelligence case already.

462
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,390
He has ordered to investigate it thoroughly.

463
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,740
How will he punish Yang Yi?

464
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,980
He didn't say.

465
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,620
Maybe he wanted to save some face for Zhuge Liang.

466
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:01,300
Once you

467
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,540
takes control over Siwencao,

468
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,230
Yang Yi

469
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,750
won't be able to make trouble anymore.

470
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,150
Baidi must've turned for a reason.

471
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,430
And there must

472
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,820
be his accomplices

473
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,580
and a Wei spy in Siwencao.

474
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,460
We've got

475
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,700
to investigate this case thoroughly

476
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,680
no matter how powerful the people

477
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,230
involved are.

478
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,240
We can't let them off.

479
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,030
Siwencao used to be a place

480
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:19,340
where any outsider can get in.

481
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,390
And now

482
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:21,760
it's time to change.

483
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,100
Get ready

484
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,150
to go to Nanzheng.

485
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,600
Aye.

486
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,030
Who are you?

487
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:32,570
Stop.

488
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,630
I just told you earlier.

489
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,330
I'm the Chief Guard

490
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,440
to Guo Huai, the Regional Inspector in Yongzhou.

491
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:38,860
Commander Guo?

492
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,190
According to Commander Guo's written order,

493
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,820
I came here to execute you.

494
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,260
It must be a misunderstanding.

495
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:47,620
Stop pretending.

496
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:49,080
You

497
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,650
are Baidi, a Shu spy.

498
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,060
Commander Guo

499
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,780
has confirmed your identity.

500
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,220
There's no misunderstanding.

501
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,550
Since you are from Yongzhou,

502
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,910
you should know

503
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,450
that I'm Commander Guo's right-hand man.

504
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,330
Right-hand man?

505
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,620
You stole intelligence for several times.

506
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,730
And this time,

507
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,250
the Shu army attempted to invade,

508
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,070
so you stole the Jieting intelligence.

509
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,100
There's hard evidence.

510
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,210
You...

511
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,270
Where's the evidence?

512
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:20,800
Where is it?

513
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:22,660
Fine.

514
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,590
Maybe these will convince you.

515
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:27,160
These

516
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,030
are the Commander's written order

517
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,620
and the token of the Commander's Mansion.

518
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:32,950
If you have evidence,

519
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,900
why are you burying me alive in secret?

520
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,500
Take me to see Commander Guo!

521
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,440
Take me to see Commander Guo!

522
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:39,810
Baidi Chen Gong.

523
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,230
If you tell me your accomplices,

524
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:44,320
I'll let you live.

525
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,910
You are framing me!

526
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,420
You are framing me!

527
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:48,480
Shame on you!

528
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,500
In that case,

529
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,520
I'll just have

530
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,890
to send you to death.

531
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,220
Carry on.

532
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:55,860
Hey.

533
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,620
Take me to see Commander Guo!

534
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,300
Chen Gong.

535
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,660
Confess.

536
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,370
Will you confess or not?

537
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,240
Shameless.

538
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,150
Chen Gong.

539
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,010
Will you confess or not?

540
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:08,940
Chen Gong.

541
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,180
You are framing me.

542
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,430
Will you confess or not?

543
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,180
You are framing me.

544
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:17,600
Go on.

545
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:18,730
Don't stop.

546
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:34,680
Stop.

547
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,370
Xun Xu.

548
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,140
Pull him out.

549
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,090
I'm not coming out.

550
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:50,900
Then stay here.

551
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,470
You didn't betray us.

552
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:11,790
Of course not.

553
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,820
If you did,

554
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,210
you would tell the truth

555
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,030
when facing death just now.

556
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,490
What if I told the truth?

557
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:22,720
You'd kill me?

558
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,010
I'd interrogate you first.

559
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:28,900
If I've turned,

560
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,140
would I stay in Tianshui

561
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,380
and wait for you guys to arrest me?

562
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,100
Come on. Don't be angry.

563
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,570
Chancellor Mi, nice move.

564
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,870
It's been half a month, but there's still no lead.

565
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,300
It really pisses me off.

566
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,830
It's not that I'm incompetent.

567
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,900
The Shu spy is too sly.

568
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,540
Stop talking nonsense.

569
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,290
Report.

570
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:20,920
Chancellor Mi,

571
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,700
we found the features of the hoof mark.

572
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,510
Chancellor, look.

573
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,820
The scuff of this part is quite special.

574
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,710
If we can find this horse,

575
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:31,890
we'll be able to locate that person.

576
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:35,580
It's a good idea.

577
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,740
It's worth trying.

578
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,170
It's a little shabby here.

579
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:40,250
Hope you won't mind.

580
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,680
(Chen Gong’s Residence)
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

581
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,530
(Tianshui, the Wei State)
Hope you won't mind.

582
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:40,250
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

583
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,520
To avoid trouble,
(Chen Gong’s Residence)
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

584
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:43,950
(Chen Gong’s Residence)
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

585
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:44,080
I'll let Lin Liang
(Chen Gong’s Residence)
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

586
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,240
I'll let Lin Liang

587
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,700
deliver meals to you.

588
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,300
You are the Recorder in Tianshui,

589
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,290
the one in charge of supplies.

590
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,070
Who would investigate you?

591
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:55,550
You are doing it right now, aren't you?

592
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:00,760
Guo Gang

593
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:01,940
is also

594
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,400
investigating Baidi,

595
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:05,910
and he's looking for clues everywhere.

596
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,000
Baidi is a top secret in Siwencao.

597
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:11,800
How did they find out?

598
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,830
Is there still any secret in Siwencao?

599
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,990
It's just like

600
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,720
a dilapidated house.

601
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:20,840
Only Feng Ying still takes it seriously.

602
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,910
Feng Ying said you were safe.

603
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,780
That wasn't the only thing he said, right?

604
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,110
He must think I'm the one

605
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,230
who killed the spy he sent.

606
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,020
Chen Gong,

607
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,320
we suffered a terrible defeat in Jieting.

608
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:43,840
It's only normal for Siwencao to carry out an internal investigation.

609
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,470
You should try to understand.

610
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,460
You want me to understand. How?

611
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:49,780
Xun Xu,

612
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,140
a Wei spy

613
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,250
has infiltrated into Siwencao.

614
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,140
His code name is Zhulong.

615
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,670
Zhulong?

616
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:01,210
I'm afraid he also knows

617
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,460
you are sent here.

618
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:12,740
Xun Xu.

619
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,780
The intelligence I delivered was,

620
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,820
"Zhang He's army will take Fanxu Road to leave the border

621
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,320
and he'll attack Jieting at night."

622
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:24,350
I sealed it myself.

623
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,880
But when it was delivered to the Prime Minister's camp,

624
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,250
it had been swapped.

625
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,510
Do you have evidence?

626
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:40,980
Evidence?

627
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:43,340
Isn't finding evidence your job?

628
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:44,960
Do you think Feng Ying

629
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,980
would accept your explanation?

630
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,580
I have predicted

631
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,090
that Siwencao would send someone to investigate,

632
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,440
but I didn't expect they'd send you,

633
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,150
and investigate in this way.

634
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,300
Before I left,

635
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,030
Clerk Feng gave me this dagger,

636
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,220
and put poison on it.

637
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:17,660
They didn't ask me to test you,

638
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,480
but to kill you.

639
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,300
Kill me.

640
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,300
The truth hasn't been found out yet.

641
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,740
How could they make such a hasty decision?

642
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:35,860
Xun Xu,

643
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,440
do you think I'm a traitor?

644
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,270
It never crossed my mind.

645
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,720
I'm also poisoned.

646
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,700
I can't get the antidote

647
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,380
until I kill you.

648
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:00,700
So if you let me live,

649
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,080
you'll die.

650
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,980
Of course I don't want to die.

651
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,320
But the truth is more important.

652
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,130
You are just as reckless

653
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,170
and silly

654
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,600
as always.

655
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,200
Hide. Hide.

656
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:39,700
Recorder Chen.

657
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,090
Chancellor Mi.

658
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,830
Welcome to my home.

659
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,910
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

660
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:47,640
So I could prepare for your visit.

661
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,510
What's the fun in that if you were prepared?

662
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,190
The Governor... He...

663
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,660
He blamed me many times

664
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:56,420
for stirring trouble

665
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:57,690
and questioning you for no reason.

666
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,950
Please forgive me, Recorder Chen.

667
00:27:58,970 --> 00:27:59,780
Today

668
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,940
I'm here to apologize to you.

669
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,980
It's no problem.

670
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,020
You don't have to.

671
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,140
Then...

672
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,680
Then...

673
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:09,990
Please come inside.

674
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:10,750
Sure.

675
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:11,090
Please.

676
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:11,590
Thanks.

677
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,460
This way.

678
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:18,390
Please...

679
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:21,910
Please take a seat over here.

680
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,690
Sometimes I make

681
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,400
craftwork in this warehouse.

682
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:28,120
Chancellor Mi,

683
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,150
I didn't know you also liked such stuff.

684
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,550
I wouldn't say I like.

685
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,230
It's just I've never seen such craftsmanship.

686
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:38,050
Recorder Chen, you are indeed handy.

687
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,760
Careful.

688
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,750
The stairs are steep.

689
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:53,200
Oh.

690
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,060
Am I intruding?

691
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:01,860
No, it's fine.

692
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:58,150
This...

693
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,910
This attic

694
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,520
is quite nice.

695
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,580
What else do you want to see?

696
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,820
-Now, please take a seat in the living room.
-Thanks.

697
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:39,540
It's a small

698
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,840
apology gift for you.

699
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:41,990
Hope you don't mind.

700
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,720
Chancellor Mi,

701
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:46,020
stop beating around the bush.

702
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,120
What are you here for?

703
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,780
Just get to the point.

704
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,730
I still have some questions,

705
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,880
and I hope you

706
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,900
can answer them for me.

707
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,480
Chancellor, you are truly good

708
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,710
at backstabbing.

709
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:03,650
Prejudice.

710
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,060
You always hold

711
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,630
a prejudice against me.

712
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,920
It's still about the fire in the Commander's camp.

713
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:20,190
I heard that you went to the camp

714
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:23,660
to bring medicine to the Commander.

715
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,720
The Governor

716
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,540
did explain that to me.

717
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,570
He told me that the Commander has a chronic disease.

718
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,060
Over the past year,

719
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,880
he prepared the medicine,

720
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,470
and then

721
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:37,270
asked you to bring it to the Commander's place monthly,

722
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,100
so that he could decoct it

723
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,190
and take it.

724
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,280
Right?

725
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,860
Looks like you know everything already.

726
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,290
Then what else do you want to ask?

727
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,800
It's still too soon

728
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:48,690
to say

729
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:49,920
I know everything.

730
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,070
So…

731
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:19,550
Buddy,

732
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:22,070
this horse has a bad temper. It'd kick you.

733
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,980
I told you to be careful.

734
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:28,970
Chancellor Mi,

735
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,020
is this your idea

736
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,330
of apologizing to me?

737
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,680
Sorry. I'm sorry.

738
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:39,240
But speaking of the horse.,

739
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,840
I still have a small question.

740
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,480
Back then there were all military horses within five-kilometer radius

741
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,510
surrounding the Commander's camp.

742
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,020
Only yours was a civilian horse.

743
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:50,650
See?

744
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:52,580
You are here to interrogate me, aren't you?

745
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,170
Do you have evidence then?

746
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:58,280
No.

747
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,920
That's why I need to investigate.

748
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:04,210
This is a hoof mark we found in the woods

749
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,200
at the southwest corner of the camp.

750
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,040
It belonged to a civilian horse.

751
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:09,640
Hmm.

752
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,480
Let's say

753
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,890
you had a piece of intelligence,

754
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:17,990
and you needed to send it out.

755
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,690
So you gave it

756
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,000
to your attendant,

757
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:23,580
who then rode the horse and left.

758
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:25,300
And next,

759
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,710
you were detained in the camp for seven days,

760
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:30,010
so you could not only prove your innocence,

761
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,210
but also deliver the intelligence.

762
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,480
Chancellor,

763
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:37,680
since you put it this way,

764
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,620
there's nothing left for me to say.

765
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:40,980
Just go ahead and check.

766
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,670
This horseshoe is new.

767
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:05,020
So is this one.

768
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:07,660
Good.

769
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:09,989
As long as it's not the one we are looking for.

770
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,219
Recorder Chen, the horseshoes are all new, huh?

771
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,639
Wouldn't you change them when they are broken?

772
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,260
Chancellor, do you have any better idea?

773
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,159
No.

774
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,389
Who gave you the permission to do it?

775
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,370
Who?

776
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:26,679
In my opinion,

777
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,420
(The Governor’s Prefecture)
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

778
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:27,600
(Tianshui, the Wei State)
In my opinion,

779
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:26,679
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

780
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,340
between friendship and intelligence leakage,
(The Governor’s Prefecture)
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

781
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,000
(The Governor’s Prefecture)
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

782
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,100
the latter is much more important.

783
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:33,469
Investigating Chen Gong is my job.

784
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:39,070
I admit that Chen Gong and I are friends.

785
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:41,409
Tianshui was conquered

786
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,840
because of the former Governor

787
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,210
Ma Zun's

788
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:46,989
neglect of duty.

789
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:48,860
I led my troops and fought so hard to defend the city,

790
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,090
yet the reinforcement never came.

791
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,180
Our Wei army

792
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,870
will never surrender!

793
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:04,780
Come on!

794
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,190
(Chen Gong)

795
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,040
Guo Gang!
(Chen Gong)

796
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:21,650
Let's go.

797
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:27,740
Back then,

798
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,420
Chen Gong did save your life.

799
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:29,880
That's right.

800
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,630
But let me tell you,

801
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,070
I won't take sides because of this.

802
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,470
If you want to investigate him,

803
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,360
fine,

804
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:38,140
do it.

805
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:39,570
You must do it.

806
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,940
But make sure to find out the truth.

807
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:49,270
(Chen Gong’s Residence)
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

808
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,110
I didn't expect the Wei State

809
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,740
would take the Jieting intelligence incident

810
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,710
so seriously.

811
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:57,010
I didn't expect

812
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,800
that they'd come today either.

813
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:02,800
And you happened to be here.

814
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:03,980
It was so close.

815
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,400
I almost struck just now.

816
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:09,380
I'm glad you didn't.

817
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:12,600
But there's one thing I can't figure out.

818
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,860
The code is designed for Baidi exclusively.

819
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,740
Only you and Clerk Cao know how to crack it.

820
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:19,240
How did Zhulong falsify the intelligence?

821
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,420
We can only catch Zhulong

822
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,470
and ask him.

823
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,840
But Zhulong

824
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,260
must have left

825
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:31,710
some sort of trace

826
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,610
when he delivered the info to Guo Gang.

827
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,620
Using Military Messenger

828
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,110
is the fastest

829
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,630
and the safest way.

830
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:42,560
The Wei State

831
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,430
keeps track of their Military Messengers.

832
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,540
It's been over a month since the Jieting incident happened.

833
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,720
Would they still keep the records?

834
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,310
The earlier ones

835
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,030
may have been destroyed.

836
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,160
But Zhulong

837
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,540
just delivered a piece of intelligence

838
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,770
regarding the arrival of a Shu spy

839
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,060
to Guo Gang a few days ago.

840
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:58,990
I can start from there.

841
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:01,730
Let's do it.

842
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,750
(The Military Intelligence Agency of Wei)
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

843
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:05,310
Chancellor.
(The Military Intelligence Agency of Wei)
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

844
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:05,720
(The Military Intelligence Agency of Wei)
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

845
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,270
Chancellor.
(The Military Intelligence Agency of Wei)
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

846
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:11,280
Come on.

847
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:12,800
Chancellor.

848
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,020
We've found out something.

849
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:14,630
Tell me.

850
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:17,810
We put three defense lines in Shanggui at the time

851
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:20,360
to prevent the Shu spies from delivering intelligence.

852
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:23,380
And the
entry and exit permit
issued by the Commander

853
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,210
must be checked at each defense line.

854
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,390
Show me your
entry and exit permit
.

855
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,070
The time range was between the fire

856
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:32,420
and the interception of the Shu's Military Messenger

857
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,780
in the evening next day in the Duan'gu Valley.

858
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,330
We checked all the people

859
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,670
and carriages leaving the town

860
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:39,820
during such time.

861
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,040
There was one carriage

862
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:45,440
that sneaked out of the town

863
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,910
by blending in the people who entered the town

864
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,150
at about nine in the morning.

865
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,100
By blending in the people who entered the town?

866
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,140
That's right.

867
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,110
The Shu spy took advantage

868
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,250
of our security flaw

869
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,750
and passed the security check,

870
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:56,660
and then turned around right away.

871
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,480
He presented to enter the town,

872
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,580
since he didn't have the required document,

873
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,930
he'd be stopped by the guards

874
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,160
and then escorted out immediately.

875
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,280
That's how he set us up.

876
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,770
And that's how Baidi sent

877
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,970
the intelligence to Shanggui.

878
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,590
Who did it?

879
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:16,440
The owner of Jili Carriage Shop.

880
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:17,370
His name is Gu Zheng.

881
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,590
Carriage Shop?

882
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:19,420
Yes.

883
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:20,740
We also found out

884
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,610
that he commutes between Wei and Shu

885
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:24,430
quite often with the excuse of border trade.

886
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,860
After Baidi stole the intelligence from the Commander's camp,

887
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,930
he delivered it to his right-hand man

888
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:30,920
who hid in the woods at the southwest corner of the camp.

889
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:32,900
And then the intelligence

890
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,900
was sent to Gu Zheng.

891
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,150
That sounds about right.

892
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:41,080
We'll get a breakthrough soon.

893
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,010
(Jili Carriage Shop)
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

894
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:47,280
Minus 120.
(Jili Carriage Shop)
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

895
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,650
(Jili Carriage Shop)
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

896
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:50,820
Mister Gu,

897
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,500
We've got a shortfall in revenue in the first half of the year.

898
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:55,300
It's war time.

899
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,610
(Spy of the Shu State)
(Gu Zheng)

900
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:55,660
(Gu Zheng)
It's war time.

901
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:55,300
(Gu Zheng)

902
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:58,650
Our business will surely be impacted.
(Spy of the Shu State)
(Gu Zheng)

903
00:38:58,650 --> 00:38:59,610
(Spy of the Shu State)
(Gu Zheng)

904
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:00,320
As long as we can still keep the shop open.
(Spy of the Shu State)
(Gu Zheng)

905
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,100
As long as we can still keep the shop open.

906
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,630
Why are you home so late?

907
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:08,550
There was a package from Hanzhong.

908
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,380
It must be delivered to Chidi immediately.

909
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,560
So I came back late.

910
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,660
What about Baidi?

911
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:17,330
There hasn't been any package for him for months.

912
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:19,260
Did something

913
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,770
happen to him?

914
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,200
I'm not sure.

915
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,910
Prime Minister Zhuge lost the battle in Jieting.

916
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,110
It makes me feel uneasy.

917
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,570
We are just messengers.

918
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:34,330
Don't worry

919
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:35,370
about other things.

920
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,570
Xun Xu.

921
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,950
How's Yue doing?

922
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:47,960
She's good.

923
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:49,620
She in Daba Mountain right now.

924
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,400
She's not on a trip.

925
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:51,650
Daba Mountain?

926
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:52,950
You put her in the field?

927
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:53,980
It's too dangerous.

928
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,740
Don't forget

929
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:58,810
that the Xun family and the Di family

930
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:00,220
have been spies for generations.

931
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,170
Besides, it was her idea.

932
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,470
I couldn't stop her.

933
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,400
What's the mission?

934
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,980
The Wuxian Sect is expanding in Hanzhong.

935
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:16,820
The Prime Minister ordered us

936
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,160
to prevent it from developing.

937
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:20,870
The Wuxian Sect established by the remnants of Zhang Lu?

938
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,600
Yes. They gave it a new name,

939
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,670
and it's still the same thing.

940
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:28,340
Is she safe?

941
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,120
Yes.

942
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:32,220
She contacts with me only.

943
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:33,360
No one else

944
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,450
knows her identity.

945
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:39,460
Well,

946
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:41,370
when doing our job,

947
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:42,260
safety

948
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:44,020
is never guaranteed.

949
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:46,580
Don't worry about her.

950
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,120
No matter what,

951
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,280
she's still in Shu,

952
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,820
much safer than you are.

953
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,450
That Mi Chong seems

954
00:40:58,810 --> 00:40:59,770
to be quite smart.

955
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,300
You've got to be careful.

956
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:07,990
None for me.

957
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,160
Alright, I have to go now.

958
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:48,730
It'll only be three months,

959
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,190
a year, tops.

960
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:51,650
We'll see each other soon.

961
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:57,690
Then I'll see you at Siwencao

962
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:59,190
when you come back.

963
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,050
Yue,

964
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:02,300
Don't joke

965
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:03,500
about this.

966
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,420
I'm not joking.

967
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,580
If you and my cousin can be spies,

968
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,530
why can't I?

969
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:09,660
Besides,

970
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,470
if I become a spy,

971
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:13,110
I may get to see you more often.

972
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,030
Yue,

973
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:21,180
you know what I want the most

974
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:23,140
is for you to be safe.

975
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,120
I know.

976
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:25,160
Stop nagging.

977
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:26,160
All right.

978
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:36,330
This is an amulet

979
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:37,670
I got from the Qingfeng Ridge.

980
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,460
Make sure to wear it all the time.

981
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:43,810
Okay.

982
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:44,920
I'll wear it all the time.

983
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:45,610
I won't take it off.

984
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:48,100
Don't cry.

985
00:42:58,610 --> 00:42:59,660
How are you doing?

986
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:13,590
We got something.

987

(The 24 Strategies of War, The Wind Blows from Longxi)
(Intelligence Agency in Longxi)

988
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,220
(The Second Strategy)
(Loot a Burning House)

989
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:26,060
The false intelligence case

990
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,460
is developing fast.

991
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,440
General Li Yan is using the failure of the Northern Expedition

992
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:32,110
to impeach Prime Minister Zhuge.

993
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:33,870
I think the good days of Siwencao

994
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,060
will come to an end.

995
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:38,570
Xun Xu successfully infiltrated the Wei State

996
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:40,360
and planned the ambush mission against Baidi.

997
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,740
But, speaking of looting a burning house,

998
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,820
Li Yan is the best of them.

999
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,770
His target is Siwencao, right?

1000
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:48,450
He's using the impeachment

1001
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:50,820
to take over Siwencao, right?

1002
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,800
I, too, need to take this chance

1003
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:55,340
to apply for a transfer.

1004
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:57,790
It's really hard to earn money.

1005

Life is hard for Chen Gong now.

00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:07,990
He's best friend Xun Xu

1007
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:09,090
abducted him to the field

1008
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,330
and forced him to confess his identity

1009
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:11,920
by burying him alive.

1010
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,940
On the side of Wei, Chen Gong

1011
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,110
is not having a good time, either.

1012
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:18,170
He is suspected by Mi Chong of being a spy of Shu.

1013
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:20,790
Mi Chong even paid a visit to check him.

1014
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:21,670
If you ask me,

1015
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:23,320
I think Chen Gong is

1016
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,310
going out on a limb.

1017
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,810
He doesn't know which will come first, tomorrow or the accident.

1018
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:30,750
Chen Gong has explained to Xun Xu

1019
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,560
that someone else swapped the message.

1020
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,550
His code name is Zhulong.

1021
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:36,460
But Xun Xu has his own mission.

1022
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:37,410
The order was to kill you.

1023
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:39,700
How are they going to

1024
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:40,980
solve this tricky task?

1025
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:41,720
Don't ask me.

1026
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,460
Just watch the new episode tomorrow!
