00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,539
Oh, you're back, Xun Xu.
(Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:41,020
Come on.

(Nanzheng County, the Shu State)
(Siwencao Intelligence)

11
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,100
Thank you, Clerk Li.

12
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,090
You're now a hero of our department.

13
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,570
Clerk Feng told me

14
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,750
about your condition.

15
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,620
I also advised him

16
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:52,990
(Li Miao)
(Chief Clerk, Siwencao Intelligence, the Shu State)

17
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:54,750
that when you were back from the mission,
(Li Miao)
(Chief Clerk, Siwencao Intelligence, the Shu State)

18
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,060
(Li Miao)
(Chief Clerk, Siwencao Intelligence, the Shu State)

19
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,539
you could serve as the Chief

00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:56,580
(Li Miao)
(Chief Clerk, Siwencao Intelligence, the Shu State)

of the Internal Affairs Department.
(Li Miao)
(Chief Clerk, Siwencao Intelligence, the Shu State)

22
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,060
of the Internal Affairs Department.

23
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,740
Thank you, Clerk Li.

24
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,780
Be seated, first. Come on.

25
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,130
Did you get any news

26
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,450
in Tianshui?

27
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,380
Leave us.

28
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,079
Aye.

29
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,040
Xun Xu,

30
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,860
you and I

31
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,010
both work for the Shu State.

32
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,340
Feel free to say anything.

33
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,020
As long as it's about work,

34
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,220
I'll fully support you.

35
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,320
As far as I know,

36
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,630
Siwencao Intelligence

37
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,650
has been infiltrated by Wei spies.

38
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,440
What?

39
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:53,990
Did you

40
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,579
tell Clerk Feng about it?

41
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,220
Xun Xu,

42
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:11,930
if you

43
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,190
didn't tell Clerk Feng about it,

44
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,210
it was quite inappropriate.

45
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,620
But what's done is done.

46
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:24,910
Don't worry.

47
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,829
I'll keep the secret for you.

48
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,360
Thank you, Clerk Li.

49
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,720
You think Wei spies have infiltrated our department.

50
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,320
Tell me why you think so.

51
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:41,730
As far as I know,

52
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:42,850
Gu Zheng was

53
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,310
the exclusive agent for Baidi

54
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,000
who handled Baidi's intelligence alone.

55
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,790
But before Gu Zheng died, he told me

56
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,660
that he had received a secret order from Siwencao Intelligence.

57
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,960
He was asked to send intelligence

58
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,320
to a spy named Chidi

59
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,900
by shooting arrows.

60
00:03:59,010 --> 00:03:59,840
But I think

61
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,060
this spy is a phony.

62
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,820
Wei spies made use of our agent

63
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,240
to steal our military secrets.

64
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,650
The Wei spy in Siwencao Intelligence

65
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,330
is known as Zhulong.

66
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,899
Zhulong?

67
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,600
Right.

68
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,340
Zhulong...

69
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,740
I officially authorize you

70
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,810
to investigate secretly possible Wei spies

71
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,180
in Siwencao Intelligence.

72
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,710
Aye.

73
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,810
It's the duty of the Internal Affairs Department to find out spies.

74
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,470
Don't

75
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,409
tell anyone else about this.

76
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,159
Report to me directly.

77
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,260
Yes.

78
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:14,000
(Border of the Shu State)
(Yangping Pass)

79
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,140
Get off the horse. Go.

80
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:17,620
Take the inspection.

81
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:22,950
Stop.

82
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,220
You, get off the horse.

83
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,340
Take the inspection.

84
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,860
Didn't you hear me? Get off the horse for the inspection.

85
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,270
Go, go.

86
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,130
Get off the horse!

87
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,840
I said, get off the horse!

88
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:39,610
Recorder Chen.

89
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,540
Catch it.

90
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,909
Wei spies! They've got weapons!

91
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,150
Someone ran away!

92
00:05:59,170 --> 00:05:59,650
Go after him!

93
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,140
Why did Governor want evidence?

94
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,590
He should have listened to me.

95
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,300
Come with us.

96
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:38,710
Fight him!

97
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,400
It's a dead end straight ahead. He can’t get away.

98
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,490
After him!

99
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,520
Search the valley floor!

100
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,409
Find him, dead or alive!

101
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,340
Aye.

102
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,390
After we sneaked into Tianshui,

103
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,870
we found that the Intelligence Agency was strictly guarded

104
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,370
and we failed to get any intel.

105
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,320
So, I first contacted Baidi's agent,

106
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,070
Gu Zheng,

107
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,250
to verify

108
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,070
the transmission process of Jieting's false intelligence.

109
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,140
Strangely,

110
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,060
Gu Zheng killed himself.

111
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,170
His wife and daughter were put in prison.

112
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,360
Our post Jili Carriage Shop was shut down.

113
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,710
Because of this,

114
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,070
I was determined

115
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,340
to accelerate my action.

116
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,010
Obviously,

117
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,030
Baidi realized

118
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,940
that we suspected him

119
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,270
and then

120
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,260
he got rid of Gu Zheng to cut off the clues.

121
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,070
Yes.

122
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,480
At that time,

123
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:36,760
I indeed thought so.

124
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,299
During the operation,

125
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:43,010
the Military Intelligence Agency of Wei found us.

126
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:43,570
Kill!

127
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,039
Kill!

128
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:45,830
We managed to assassinate Baidi.

129
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,500
But we were hunted down

130
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,100
in Qingyun Canyon of Xiaolong Mountain.

131
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,430
Captain Jin

132
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,200
and his subordinates

133
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,670
all died.

134
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,400
What a pity!

135
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,100
Captain Jin was a talent in our line of work.

136
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,300
Right.

137
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,610
Captain Jin didn't panic.

138
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,130
At the last minute,

139
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,460
he and his subordinates

140
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,310
killed themselves for our state.

141
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,830
Xun Xu

142
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,460
had a temporary

143
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:17,970
and decisive solution

144
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,250
to have completed the mission very well.

145
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:21,740
In my opinion,

146
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:25,210
Jieting's false intelligence case is clear with an obvious conclusion.

147
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,620
It can be closed.

148
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,420
I totally agree with Clerk Feng's comment

149
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,740
on Chief Xun.

150
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,440
I also agree with his proposal.

151
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,050
Xun Xu will be promoted to the Chief

152
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,790
of the Internal Affairs Department.

153
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,760
Thank you, Clerk Feng.

154
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,050
Thank you, Clerk Li.

155
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,150
After Chief Xun returned,

156
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,900
he talked things over with me.

157
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,650
In this case,

158
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,780
there are still some doubtful points.

159
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,430
According to Chief Xun,

160
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,490
he investigated the case and found

161
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,740
that Gu Zheng was given another secret mission

162
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,380
even though

163
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,350
he was Baidi's exclusive agent.

164
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,520
What?

165
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:11,490
Xun Xu,

166
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,830
tell us about it.

167
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,080
There's no doubt

168
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,620
that Xun Xu will be promoted as the Chief.

169
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:29,970
(Pei Xu)
(Clerk of Internal Affairs Department, Siwencao Intelligence, the Shu State)

170
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:30,800
Of course.

00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:32,890
It was a risky mission.
(Pei Xu)
(Clerk of Internal Affairs Department, Siwencao Intelligence, the Shu State)

173
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,150
Superiors of our department

174
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,050
didn't even expect him to return alive.

175
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,110
(Liao Hui)
(Clerk of Internal Affairs Department, Siwencao Intelligence, the Shu State)

176
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:35,680
(Clerk of Internal Affairs Department, Siwencao Intelligence, the Shu State)
didn't even expect him to return alive.

177
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:35,050
(Clerk of Internal Affairs Department, Siwencao Intelligence, the Shu State)

178
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,630
I hear nearly all our spies in Longxi
(Liao Hui)
(Clerk of Internal Affairs Department, Siwencao Intelligence, the Shu State)

179
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,050
were dead.

180
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,300
(Ma Sheng)
(Clerk of Internal Affairs Department, Siwencao Intelligence, the Shu State)

181
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:39,890
(Clerk of Internal Affairs Department, Siwencao Intelligence, the Shu State)
were dead.

182
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:39,050
(Clerk of Internal Affairs Department, Siwencao Intelligence, the Shu State)

183
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,380
Even those who were sent to clean up the mess failed to return.
(Ma Sheng)
(Clerk of Internal Affairs Department, Siwencao Intelligence, the Shu State)

184
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,590
It was pretty dangerous.

185
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:45,960
Liao Hui,

186
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,820
when Chief Xun was away,

187
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,330
you still wiped his desk.

188
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,680
After he's promoted,

189
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,720
you'll get benefits, too.

190
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,790
Don't talk nonsense.

191
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,160
How about having a drink?

192
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,950
I just found a tavern

193
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:00,520
with great wine.

194
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,970
But Chief Xun looks very anxious.

195
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,190
I don't think he's in the mood for a drink.

196
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,060
Come on, man.

197
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,390
You've been working here for over six months.

198
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,830
Why are you still so childish?

199
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,420
Chief Xun is my master.

200
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,430
I'm so happy to have him back.

201
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,980
Did we

202
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:21,590
send a spy

203
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,700
codenamed Chidi?

204
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,690
We've never sent a spy

205
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,220
codenamed Chidi.

206
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,730
We've never used this code name, either.

207
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,520
Clerk Feng, is there a senior spy

208
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,580
codenamed Chidi

209
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:40,940
that you contact directly?

210
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,500
No.

211
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,700
I think

212
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,320
a Wei spy is

213
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:56,200
hiding in Siwencao Intelligence.

214
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,060
His code name is Zhulong.

215
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,970
And he faked the spy Chidi.

216
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,570
Zhulong made use of Gu Zheng

217
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,500
and it was Zhulong's agent in Wei

218
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,780
who actually received the intelligence.

219
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,800
Gu Zheng fell into his trap.

220
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,230
Chief Yin,

221
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,950
I'm a layman, anyway. Is my theory right?

222
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,600
Gu Zheng was Baidi's exclusive agent.

223
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,040
It was indeed inappropriate

224
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,420
when he transmitted intelligence to someone else.

225
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,940
Unfortunately, Gu Zheng died.

226
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,580
We can't figure out

227
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,100
who gave him the mission.

228
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,830
Clerk Li, do you have any suggestions?

229
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,100
I do have a half-baked suggestion.

230
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,400
I suggest

231
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,220
that the Jieting's false intelligence case shouldn't be closed.

232
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,760
We should put it together with Wei spy Zhulong case

233
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,550
and get to the bottom of it.

234
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:04,010
The information Chief Xun offered

235
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,200
is very important.

236
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,740
It should be investigated.

237
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,580
But I believe

238
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,860
in Siwencao Intelligence,

239
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,500
Jieting's false intelligence case

240
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,620
and Wei spy Zhulong case are irrelevant.

241
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,500
Don't mix them.

242
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,700
How about this?

243
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,110
Let's close Jieting's false intelligence case.

244
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,460
Meanwhile,

245
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,070
we'll keep hunting down Zhulong.

246
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,350
Wei spies have been

247
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,410
infiltrating our departments.

248
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,680
It's a permanent mission to find them out.

249
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,340
Clerk Li and I

250
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,310
will take the lead.

251
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,590
Xun Xu.

252
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,290
Yin Ji.

253
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:43,390
Gao Tangbing.

254
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,460
You three shall join us.

255
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:47,990
Yes.

256
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,450
We should not only hunt down Zhulong,

257
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,680
but also pay more attention

258
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,140
to Qingping Plan of the Wei State.

259
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,710
Have it investigated, too.

260
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,340
Clerk Li,

261
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,090
what do you think

262
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,590
of my decision?

263
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:05,000
This is indeed a serious matter.

264
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,380
I'll report

265
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,240
to General Li Yan about related details.

266
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,890
Chief Xun, please stay.

267
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,110
I didn't mean to say that at the meeting.

268
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,640
But Clerk Feng wanted to close the case.

269
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,680
I had to bring it up.

270
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,420
In this case,

271
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,880
I'm afraid Clerk Feng will have a bias against me.

272
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,450
As long as you told the truth,

273
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,140
you don't need to worry.

274
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,770
If you have any problems,

275
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:01,970
feel free to come to me.

276
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,260
Your department has to deal with spies.

277
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,640
You've got heavy responsibilities.

278
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,600
I'll do my best.

279
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:15,740
Mm.

280
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,630
Oh,

281
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,630
Chief Xun.

282
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,450
What Xun Xu did

283
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:36,950
was quite uncool.

284
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,310
When he returned, he played such a trick.

285
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,700
He brought up doubtful points at the meeting

286
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,610
and it wasn't against any rules.

287
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,900
We can never judge a man easily.

288
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:56,010
Feng Ying,

289
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,060
Hu Zhong told me something.

290
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,540
When General Li Yan

291
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,140
returns from Chengdu,

292
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,040
he still wants to invite you to his mansion.

293
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:08,980
We'll see.

294
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,500
General Li Yan has quite a high status.

295
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,300
He has invited you several times.

296
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,000
But you keep rejecting him.

297
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,300
Isn't it inappropriate?

298
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,810
I'm more aware of that.

299
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,340
I know what you're thinking.

300
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,720
You worry that you can hardly explain to Yang Yi

301
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,540
when he's back, right?

302
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,410
But I hear

303
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,870
Yang Yi is busy getting out of trouble himself.

304
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:44,240
What's on your mind?

305
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,240
Get down to business, will you?

306
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:47,950
But I...

307
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,310
It's a good thing

308
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,700
to get familiar with the West Bureau.

309
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,530
I get it.

310
00:16:58,910 --> 00:16:59,860
I know what to do.

311
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,400
Chief Xun.

312
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,790
Chief Xun, you’re back, at last.

313
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:11,470
Chief Xun,

314
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,210
-we can finally have a drink.
-Welcome back!

315
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:14,660
Chief Xun,

316
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,619
when you were away,

317
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:17,020
we three did your work.

318
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,950
Your seat is vacant, anyway.

319
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,579
Shall I...

320
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,670
Fine. You can sit here.

321
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:24,020
You heard him, huh? He asked me to sit here.

322
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:24,819
Thank you, Chief Xun.

323
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,319
How dare you, Chief Ma!

324
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,260
I don't dare.

325
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,130
Chief Xun,

326
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,580
when we can't enjoy the wine,

327
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,900
shouldn't you give us some money for compensation?

328
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,650
No money for you.

329
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,740
But I have

330
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,290
two daggers.

331
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,380
Pei Xu, stay.

332
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,430
Chief Xun,

333
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,930
we thought you wouldn't be able to come back.

334
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:02,650
I was all right.

335
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,380
I gained some experience, anyway.

336
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,180
How's everyone commenting

337
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,180
on Baidi's case?

338
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,730
Baidi's identity was exposed.

339
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,570
We all know he's Recorder Chen Gong in Tianshui.

340
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:14,980
When?

341
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,620
One day before you came back.

342
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,330
But no one said this at the meeting.

343
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,910
This is ridiculous!

344
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:26,790
What...

345
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,870
What's wrong?

346
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,940
It's not a place to talk.

347
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:32,810
Come out with me.

348
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:34,600
Sure.

349
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:43,480
(Border of the Shu State)
(Yangping Pass)

350
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:50,940
Search carefully

351
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,340
and check if we miss anything!

352
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,270
-Aye, sir.
-Aye, sir.

353
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:08,980
General Ma,

354
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,160
the dead Wei spy is Chen Wei.

355
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,190
We haven't found any other information yet.

356
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:15,210
(Ma Dai)
(General who subdues the north, the Shu State)

357
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,180
Is it an alias?
(Ma Dai)
(General who subdues the north, the Shu State)

358
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:16,970
(Ma Dai)
(General who subdues the north, the Shu State)

359
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:17,820
I'm not sure.
(Ma Dai)
(General who subdues the north, the Shu State)

360
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,150
(Ma Dai)
(General who subdues the north, the Shu State)

361
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,510
We found his name card and entry permit
(Ma Dai)
(General who subdues the north, the Shu State)

362
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,300
from his luggage.

363
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,160
His known identity is a merchant of brocade.

364
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,210
What about the other Wei spy?

365
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,770
He's being hunted down.

366
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,270
We lost him in Zilong Canyon.

367
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,370
And we're still searching for him.

368
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:48,890
Hand over the exhibits of Wei spies

369
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,860
to Siwencao Intelligence

370
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,350
and leave the investigation to them.

371
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,070
(Yangping Pass)

372
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,520
Baidi is intact.

373
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,040
Zhulong is

374
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,530
the real enemy.

375
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,510
But according to the report from Tianshui,

376
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,680
Chancellor Mi Chong

377
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,200
and Recorder Chen Gong fell off the cliff and died.

378
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,360
It was simply a ploy.

379
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,110
Baidi will hide himself

380
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,460
and sneak into Wuxian Sect

381
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,260
to hunt for Zhulong.

382
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,120
He and I started the journey separately.

383
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,220
Now,

384
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,210
I guess he has arrived in the Hanzhong region.

385
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,690
That would be too bad.

386
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,340
Zhulong must be contacting other Wei spies.

387
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,680
Once Baidi is exposed,

388
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,230
he'll be very dangerous in Wuxian Sect.

389
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:45,770
We got a plan for it.

390
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,300
During the journey,

391
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,070
Baidi would take place of Mi Chong.

392
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,380
Recorder Chen.

393
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:54,830
Catch it.

394
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,560
If everything goes smoothly,

395
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,460
soon we'll be informed

396
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,730
that Baidi died on his journey.

397
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,820
If Baidi is intact,

398
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,540
there must be something wrong

399
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,770
inside Siwencao Intelligence.

400
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,330
On one condition, though.

401
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,290
Zhulong has access to the code-cracking plates.

402
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,250
When I was in Wudu,

403
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,080
Chief Gao told me

404
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,600
as soon as Baidi got Zhang He's operation plan,

405
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:36,390
he had a Military Messenger send it back urgently.

406
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,840
However, the Military Messenger was found by the Wei Army.

407
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,860
Elite soldiers were sent to kill him.

408
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,170
The Military Messenger traveled day and night.

409
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,940
When he reached the camp, he was badly wounded.

410
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,260
Before he died,

411
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,740
he gave the secret letter to Yang Yi.

412
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,120
Report! A letter from the Military Messenger.

413
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,020
Come on in.

414
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,930
The Military Messenger died out of our camp.

415
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,620
Compensate his family and bury him.

416
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,250
Aye.

417
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,610
It's a cipher letter from Baidi. Decipher it.

418
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:45,490
Sun Ling.

419
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,780
Summon Sun Ling of the scribe room.

420
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,540
Summon Sun Ling of the scribe room.

421
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,880
The Military Messenger

422
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,230
sacrificed his life for the intelligence.

423
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,150
So,

424
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,570
something must have gone wrong

425
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,460
after the letter arrived at Qishan Camp.

426
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,460
We must report it to the Prime Minister immediately.

427
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:46,840
Guards!

428
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,840
Only Chief Yang read Baidi's letter.

429
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,600
After that, few people

430
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,550
could touch the letter.

431
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,540
Theoretically, Feng Ying is the prime suspect.

432
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,350
But I don't suspect his loyalty.

433
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,800
Yang Yi and Clerk Feng set up Siwencao Intelligence.

434
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:10,490
Even if

435
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,060
Clerk Feng was fishy,

436
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,800
he wouldn't expose himself

437
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,700
with such a clumsy trick.

438
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,120
Zhulong is

439
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,300
right behind Clerk Feng.

440
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,530
Sun Ling.

441
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,340
Why?

442
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,860
First, Zhulong must be someone close to Feng Ying.

443
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,540
Sun Ling was at the front and he knew a lot of intel.

444
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,290
Most importantly,

445
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,030
as he works in the scribe room,

446
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,590
he has been keeping Baidi's code-cracking plates.

447
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:42,180
If he wanted to do something to the intel,

448
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:43,830
he had the most opportunities

449
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:45,610
and it was very easy for him.

450
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:51,730
When you were away,

451
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,770
Siwencao Intelligence was turned upside down.

452
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,680
Yang Yi abdicated.

453
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,150
General Li Yan took it over.

454
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,900
Sun Ling is Clerk Feng's brother-in-law.

455
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:01,940
They...

456
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,380
They're very close.

457
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,020
I know that.

458
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,790
If you get involved,

459
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,010
you'll easily be sold out.

460
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,950
Clerk Li kept reminding me

461
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:15,600
to keep it secretly.

462
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,410
But at the meeting in the morning,

463
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,190
he brought it up.

464
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,410
That put me in a difficult position.

465
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:25,010
Look, look.

466
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,820
He meant to sow dissension.

467
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,130
The West Bureau always wants to defeat the East.

468
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,000
They desire to stir up trouble in Siwencao Intelligence.

469
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:34,770
I guess Clerk Feng

470
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:36,970
will soon have a talk with me.

471
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,600
Have you figured out what to explain?

472
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:45,780
Not yet.

473
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,540
If we want to investigate Sun Ling,

474
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:53,780
we have to let Clerk Feng know it.

475
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,320
Since I came back,

476
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,380
I've felt that someone is watching me

477
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,540
in the dark.

478
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:18,220
Chief Xun, don’t scare me.

479
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:26,880
The wind is rising.

480
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:33,310
Chief Xun,

481
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:35,580
someone from the military has come.

482
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,100
Clerk Feng is looking for you.

483
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:38,210
He asked you to see him immediately.

484
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,000
The military?

485
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:39,540
Yeah.

486
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,770
We should communicate more about intel.

487
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:48,860
All right.

488
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,820
As for the detailed city defense plan,

489
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,180
I'll give it to you in a couple of days.

490
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,300
Fine.

491
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,020
Clerk Feng.

492
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:58,410
Be seated.

493
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,570
Let me introduce.

494
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:03,460
This is Commandant Qiao Jun from the Military Technology Department.

495
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:06,540
(Qiao Jun)
(Commandant of the Military Technology Department, the Shu State)

496
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,830
(Commandant of the Military Technology Department, the Shu State)
This is Commandant Qiao Jun from the Military Technology Department.

497
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:03,460
(Commandant of the Military Technology Department, the Shu State)

498
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,850
You must be Chief Xun of the Internal Affairs Department.
(Qiao Jun)
(Commandant of the Military Technology Department, the Shu State)

499
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:08,900
I am.

500
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,200
You're a clever young man.

501
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,350
Commandant Qiao Jun,

502
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:14,500
you flatter me.

503
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,330
This time,

504
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,840
Chief Xun went to the Wei State

505
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,240
and got a lot of direct intel.

506
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:22,990
The Military Intelligence Agency of Wei

507
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:25,100
has set their eyes on our crossbows.

508
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,600
Clerk Feng, an urgent report from Yangping Pass.

509
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:36,160
Briefly introduce Qingping Plan to us.

510
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:39,560
Qingping Plan of Wei

511
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,820
involves a number of operations.

512
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,880
One of them

513
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,460
is about our crossbows.

514
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,300
-The Military Intelligence Agency of Wei
-Leave us.

515
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,180
will send the most capable spies

516
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,790
to sneak into the Hanzhong region.

517
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,740
With the help of Wuxian Sect,

518
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,410
they will steal our crossbow techniques.

519
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,300
(Found two Wei spies, one dead, the other at large. Find him.)

520
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,140
Since the Military Technology Department was founded four years ago,
(Found two Wei spies, one dead, the other at large. Find him.)

521
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:59,250
we have invented more than thirty kinds of crossbows.

522
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,790
I wonder what kinds of crossbows

523
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,980
they want to steal.

524
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,780
As far as we know,

525
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,230
they want two types,

526
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:08,880
Shudu and Yuanrong.

527
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,610
They're quite ambitious.

528
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,780
Shudu and Yuanrong

529
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,450
are the latest crossbows

530
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,810
and they’re rather powerful.

531
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,100
Looks like they’re very well-informed.

532
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:20,340
Chief Xun,

533
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,110
the guests you mentioned

534
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,700
may have appeared.

535
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,960
It's an urgent report from General Ma Dai.

536
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,500
Wei spies came. One died and the other ran away.

537
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,760
We're asked to investigate the case.

538
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,220
One of the spies ran away?

539
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,180
Right.

540
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,460
Have your men verify it.

541
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:36,820
All right.

542
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,140
Clerk Feng, let me

543
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,590
talk with Commandant Qiao Jun for the rest of the case.

544
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,140
Commandant,

545
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,820
Clerk Feng is quite busy with work.

546
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,290
Please go to the meeting room with me.

547
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,550
No problem.

548
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:47,470
Come, please.

549
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:04,450
This way, please.

550
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:04,770
After you.

551
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:23,950
Chief Xun,

552
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:25,840
what’s wrong?

553
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:27,550
Nothing.

554
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:28,640
After you.

555
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:43,210
(State Road, the Shu State)

556
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,870
Sir, could you give me a ride?

557
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:00,990
Come up.

558
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:04,730
Sit firmly.

559
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,640
Sure.

560
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:06,630
Gee.

561
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,140
Where are you going?

562
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:11,880
Xixiang Town.

563
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:15,030
I'm delivering the mulberry saplings to Nanxiang Town

564
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:16,270
and I'll pass Xixiang Town.

565
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,380
I'm Qin Ze from Mianzhu.

566
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,750
But people often think I'm from Xuzhou because I look strong.

567
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:26,830
I haven't ever been to the Central Plains.

568
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,660
I wonder if it's a better place than Yizhou.

569
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,930
By the way, what's your name?

570
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:34,860
Mi Heng.

571
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,260
Mi?

572
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,580
It's a rare family name.

573
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,660
In Yizhou, there's also a big Mi family.

574
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:45,620
Their ancestor Mi Zhu was the General of Peace.

575
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,290
Are you one of that clan?

576
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,460
I'm too insignificant to be his family.

577
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,900
Where did you come from?

578
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:52,950
Ankang.

579
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,870
I'm a merchant.

580
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:56,570
What do you sell?

581
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,590
Daily essentials

582
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,800
as well as crude drugs.

583
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:06,260
Aren't there supposed to be two men?

584
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:10,460
At Yangping Pass, the Shu Army

585
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:11,660
found us.

586
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:12,700
The other one died.

587
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,510
Don't worry.

588
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,500
Our business won't be held up.

589
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,800
There's a pass before Xixiang Town.

590
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:23,690
It's the last gate before we can enter the Hanzhong region.

591
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:24,670
We'll have to be strictly checked there.

592
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,650
Keep up our spirit.

593
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:32,430
A military representative is here.

594
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,350
Why did he talk to Xun Xu?

595
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,270
I know that man.

596
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:38,230
He's Qiao Jun from the Military Technology Department.

597
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,220
I guess they'll talk about Qingping Plan of Wei.

598
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:43,810
Oh, Xun Xu.

599
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,940
Let me remind you.

600
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,230
Don't get too close to him.

601
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,670
Why?

602
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:50,610
He's a troublemaker.

603
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,660
Didn't you see it

604
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,700
at the meeting this morning?

605
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,300
The East Bureau wants to close the case

606
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:57,410
while the West doesn't.

607
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,350
What does it have to do with Xun Xu?

608
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,030
Is this all you can see?

609
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,740
What do you think, Chief Yin?

610
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,140
My point is

611
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,740
that we have to pick a side at the point of no return.

612
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:18,220
Come on, we just stick to the issues.

613
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,280
We're not sure

614
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,630
if the two cases will be put together.

615
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:23,500
Have you heard about it?

616
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,750
Prime Minister Zhuge was impeached

617
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,180
by all the clans in west Sichuan.

618
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,560
In a day or two,

619
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:31,700
the result will become manifest.

620
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,130
That's strife among the top leadership.

621
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,600
It has nothing to do with us.

622
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:37,100
Go on.

623
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,470
Go on pretending.

624
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:40,130
I'm not pretending.

625
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:41,170
Think about it.

626
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:42,980
Do not get involved in a mess.

627
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:43,810
It's our principle.

628
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:47,900
It makes sense.

629
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:49,850
Tangbing,

630
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,780
you've enlightened me.

631
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:54,360
You flatter me.

632
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,870
Don't say that.

633
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:59,810
Siwencao Intelligence has already been in a mess.

634
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,180
When Xun Xu brought up this case,

635
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,520
the West Bureau will make an issue of it.

636
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:08,850
Clerk Feng just invited us

637
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:10,280
to have a drink in Ziyan Tavern.

638
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:11,350
Would you like to go?

639
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:13,820
Tonight?

640
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:15,170
Who has he invited?

641
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,640
You and me only.

642
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:19,200
See?

643
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,350
He's also starting to build his clique.

644
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,030
Will you go?

645
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:24,620
We should go.

646
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:26,730
Let's go, then.

647
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,080
In my opinion,

648
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:42,020
Wei spies can steal our crossbow techniques

649
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,750
through two ways.

650
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,110
I'm all ears, Chief Xun.

651
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,410
First,

652
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,270
they'll steal the drawings

653
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,310
or the crossbows.

654
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,000
Second, they'll kidnap

655
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:58,530
or buy over craftsmen and take them back to Wei.

656
00:33:59,020 --> 00:33:59,740
You know what?

657
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,380
Shudu and Yuanrong are our latest techniques

658
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,970
that are highly confidential.

659
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,820
All craftsmen do their parts separately.

660
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,300
In this case,

661
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:12,380
they won't get anything

662
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:13,940
even if they take the craftsmen back to Wei.

663
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:17,280
Very few chief craftsmen know the core technique.

664
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:18,580
As for the crossbow,

665
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:20,940
Shudu is a heavy weapon.

666
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:23,409
A small group is needed to remove it.

667
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,040
Without professional training,

668
00:34:25,449 --> 00:34:26,530
no one could dismantle it.

669
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,830
What about Yuanrong?

670
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,110
It's likely to be stolen.

671
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,699
It's specifically designed to be light

672
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,320
for individual soldiers.

673
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:34,969
But we've made a strict registration

674
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:36,940
of the numbers of crossbows.

675
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,320
They're strictly examined every day.

676
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,070
So, the best way

677
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,449
for Wei spies will be stealing the drawings.

678
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,580
Drawings?

679
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:48,949
The drawings are in two copies.

680
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,460
One is kept at the Prime Minister’s Mansion in Chengdu.

681
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:52,460
The other is kept in the head office of the Military Technology Department.

682
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:54,690
How is the head office guarded?

683
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,060
The geography around Mount Dingjun

684
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,240
is perilous.

685
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:01,890
On one side of the road are cliffs.

686
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,710
Only one switchback leads to the top of the mountain.

687
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:08,050
We set three passes along the road.

688
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,450
Everyone coming up or down has to be strictly checked.

689
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:13,900
Most importantly,

690
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,570
it's a zigzag path

691
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:17,800
without an exit.

692
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,380
Everyone has to backtrack.

693
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,170
Got it.

694
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,910
I have a piece of advice for you.

695
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,450
Change the patrol password every day

696
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,980
and it will effectively prevent Wei spies.

697
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,910
Good idea. Good idea.

698
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,210
I'll tell General Zhang Yi about it.

699
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,490
How's your conversation going?

700
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:39,550
I'm very grateful.

701
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:40,940
Chief Xun gave me

702
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,260
a very professional suggestion.

703
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,030
I'm glad to hear that.

704
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,440
I should take my leave.

705
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:46,710
See you.

706
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:50,110
Let's walk Commandant Qiao out.

707
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:51,090
No, I'll see myself out.

708
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:51,870
Farewell.

709
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:01,510
If anything happens, please keep me informed.

710
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:02,500
We will.

711
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,470
Thank you.

712
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,470
Chief Xun,

713
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:20,030
if you don't mind, shall we find a place

714
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,010
and have a talk over some tea?

715
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:24,570
Clerk Feng,

716
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,420
call me Xun Xu.

717
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:30,430
Come on.

718
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:39,490
(Border of the Shu State)
(Checkpoint at Xixiang Town)

719
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:47,940
Wait. Stop, stop.

720
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:50,580
Get off.

721
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:50,940
All right.

722
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:51,620
Let me check.

723
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:53,860
Come on.

724
00:36:58,710 --> 00:36:59,300
Be careful.

725
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,070
Mister Xu.

726
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,230
Here’s my name card.

727
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,580
It's me.

728
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:09,050
Can't you recognize me?

729
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,060
Qin Ze from Mianzhu?

730
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,540
I haven't seen you for days.

731
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,360
I miss you a lot.

732
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:17,860
Come on.

733
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:25,500
Plum wine?

734
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,560
I know you love this.

735
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,170
When I want to pass Xixiang,

736
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,630
I must be considerate.

737
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,150
I've prepared the wine for you.

738
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,320
Who's he?

739
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,300
He...

740
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,140
He's my neighbor.

741
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:39,530
I hired him as my new assistant.

742
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,170
The autumn harvest is about to start.

743
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,270
I need him to help me.

744
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,970
Anything fishy in his cart?

745
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,950
I found only two saplings.

746
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,560
Fine. You can pass.

747
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,660
Thank you, sir.

748
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:53,030
Be careful.

749
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:53,950
Come on.

750
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:03,770
Done.

751
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:06,060
We're arriving at Xixiang Town soon.

752
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,540
It's not actually our territory.

753
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,030
But when we stay there,

754
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,680
we can support the headquarters.

755
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,100
In the last two years,

756
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:17,640
Zhuge Liang has been so busy suppressing southerners and fighting against Wei

757
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,580
that he totally ignores us.

758
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:22,210
Therefore, we haven't got too many burdens.

759
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:23,870
Do you know

760
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,180
how many people there are in our sect?

761
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,780
Mi Chong, what are you doing?

762
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,270
I'm Chancellor Mi Chong of the Military Intelligence Agency.

763
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:35,840
Tonight, I must see Senior Huang Yu.

764
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,070
No problem. Our men are waiting in town.

765
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,130
Later, we’ll help you get changed.

766
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:49,690
Xun Xu, do you have a problem with me?

767
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,520
Why do you think so, Clerk Feng?

768
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:55,270
I always treat you as my respected master.

769
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,500
When you came back from Tianshui,

770
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,820
I was the one you talked to first, right?

771
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:02,790
Of course.

772
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:04,980
You dispatched me to Tianshui.

773
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,780
When I was back, I would certainly talk to you first.

774
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:08,950
But you didn't tell me about Gu Zheng's problem.

775
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:14,630
Here's the thing.

776
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:17,870
Gu Zheng's problem was only my suspicion.

777
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,460
It didn't disturb my judgment of the case.

778
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,260
When I reported to Clerk Li,

779
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:25,610
he asked questions very carefully.

780
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,020
And he insisted

781
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,250
that I should bring it up at the meeting.

782
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:33,820
Clerk Li is in charge of the Internal Affairs Department.

783
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,220
So, I...

784
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:36,540
I couldn't say no to him.

785
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:41,620
Xun Xu,

786
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,140
considering your experience and temper,

787
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,400
I'm afraid you had more reasons

788
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,850
not to tell me about it first.

789
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:54,460
Clerk Feng, you misunderstand.

790
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,580
No one else is here.

791
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,130
If you suspect anything, feel free to tell me.

792
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,730
Do you suspect me?

793
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,250
Never.

794
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:15,920
I'm glad to hear that.

795
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,530
I dispatched you to Tianshui

796
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,910
because I wanted you

797
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,700
to save Baidi.

798
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,140
I didn't want to close the case hastily.

799
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:35,710
I faced great pressure due to this decision.

800
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,030
I'm sure you're aware.

801
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:39,690
But Clerk Feng...

802
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:45,400
If Jieting's false intelligence case

803
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:48,220
can't be closed in time,

804
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,930
more people will be involved.

805
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,030
I hope you can understand that.

806
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:57,460
Therefore,

807
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,830
even if there are still many doubtful points,

808
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,540
we have to close the case.

809
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:13,320
So far,

810
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,350
Baidi is dead.

811
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,240
I’m not saying this

812
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:19,200
to win your support.

813
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,960
I just want to tell you

814
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,920
that I know better than you

815
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,470
how complicated this case is.

816
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,380
With doubtful points,

817
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:34,290
you still insist on closing the case hastily.

818
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,220
I don’t quite agree.

819
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:38,990
I knew you wouldn’t agree.

820
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,040
That's why I'm talking to you.

821
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:43,460
Have some tea.

822
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:45,310
It has a special taste.

823
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,830
Master, you've got a visitor.

824
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:56,350
Who?

825
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:57,820
A Mister Li.

826
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:59,530
He said he was your colleague in Siwencao Intelligence.

827
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,720
I'm an unexpected visitor.

828
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,880
Chief Yin, do you not welcome me?

829
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:09,020
Clerk Li, I'm honored by your gracious presence.

830
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:10,740
Come in, please.

831
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:17,780
Clerk Li,

832
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:18,820
excuse me

833
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:20,890
for this humble room.

834
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,740
Chief Yin, you have a big house in the south of the town.

835
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:27,540
Why do you live here?

836
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:32,030
This place is near Siwencao Intelligence.

837
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:33,970
It's convenient for the commute.

838
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,700
Why bother pretending to be poor?

839
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,380
What’s the point?

840
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:41,630
Clerk Li,

841
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,990
here's some great tea. Try some.

842
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:45,300
Don't bother.

843
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:46,870
I don't drink tea.

844
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,250
Today, I came here privately

845
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,770
because I want to speak my mind

846
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:53,680
to you, Chief Yin.

847
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,450
You haven't had lunch, right?

848
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:58,340
Let me get you something to eat.

849
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,320
I said, don't bother.

850
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:01,510
Sit.

851
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:14,090
(Intelligence Agency in Longxi)
(The 24 Strategies of War, The Wind Blows from Longxi)

852
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:17,360
(Body Swap and Identity Switch)
(The Sixth Strategy)

853
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,750
Xun Xu, how dare you

854
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:21,180
go over my brother-in-law

855
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,450
and report to your new boss the latest intelligence

856
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:25,910
and your suspicion about a Wei spy

857
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,230
codenamed Zhulong,

858
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:28,130
lurking in Siwencao?

859
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,320
The Wei spy in Siwencao Intelligence

860
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:31,990
is known as Zhulong.

861
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:33,800
Xun Xu and his subordinate deduced

862
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,390
who had access to Baidi's code-cracking plates

863
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,360
to find out the prime suspect of Zhulong.

864
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:39,070
Yes,

865
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:41,570
I'm in charge of transporting

866
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,470
Baidi's code-cracking plates.

867
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:44,940
But, it's just your speculation.

868
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,990
Xun Xu, you need solid proof

869
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,890
to convict me.

870
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,620
Chen Gong and Mi Chong

871
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:54,440
kept testing the other on their way.

872
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:57,350
Meanwhile, Chen Gong put all the objects

873
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:59,520
that could prove Baidi's identity

874
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:02,030
in Mi Chong's package.

875
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:07,430
And at the checkpoint on the border of the Shu State,

876
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:09,650
he got rid of Mi Chong

877
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:12,090
and took his identity as planned.

878
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:13,380
As Mi Chong,

879
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,120
he approached Wuxian Sect.

880
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:17,790
What a clever move!

881
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,170
I'm expecting applause now.

882
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,890
Whether Chen Gong can

883
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,960
infiltrate Wuxian Sect

884
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:29,810
is all in his own hands.

885
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:31,840
Besides,

886
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:33,690
Xun Xu,

887
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:35,610
how can you prove that I'm Zhulong?

888
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:37,040
This is ridiculous!
