(The Eleventh Strategy To Catch Something, First Let It Go)

3
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,720
Clerk Feng has left.

4
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:53,310
Would you like to have a seat inside, Chief Gao?

5
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,150
Sure.

6
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,700
The Agency and the garrison in Hanzhong

7
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,990
will launch a full-scale strike on the Wuxian Sect.

8
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:07,740
When?

9
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,460
It's to be determined.

10
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,480
But an operation this huge

11
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,770
requires interdepartmental coordination,

12
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:13,900
which should take

13
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:15,980
five days.

14
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,210
Will that affect the Qingping Plan?

15
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,140
It's hard to tell.

16
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,380
Feng Ying is to give you to Li Yan

17
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,600
to thank you for getting him out.

18
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,610
And I can

19
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,340
work for you from the inside. Is that so?

20
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,660
This is literally a heaven-sent chance.

21
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,880
Li Miao and Yin Ji are doomed to fail.

22
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,380
And the Agency

23
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,060
will be mine.

24
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:51,800
Scolding!

25
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,780
Haste makes waste.

26
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,820
What about Xun Xu?

27
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,450
He's merely a pawn,

28
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,540
now useless

29
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,390
to everyone.

30
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,060
Do you really have a thing for him?

31
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,380
What do you think?

(Siwencao Intelligence in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

33

Xun Xu.
(Siwencao Intelligence in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

34
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,640
(Siwencao Intelligence in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

35
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,880
Is it true that Chief Yang was found guilty

36
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,079
and deprived of all ranks?

37
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:44,760
Yes.

38
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:45,980
I heard the news, too.

39
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,540
What about Clerk Feng?

40
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,260
He was out of Nanzheng that night.

41
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:53,410
Don't worry.

42
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,760
How could I not?

43
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,220
Chief Yang is down

44
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,760
and Clerk Feng is missing.

45
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,900
A storm is breaking upon the Agency.

46
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,900
Your friend Miss Liu is really something.

47
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,450
She shouldn't have been involved.

48
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,660
Do you have a soft spot for her?

49
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,670
Give it a rest!

50
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,680
I'm not in the mood.

51
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,810
Clerk Li is calling a meeting for what?

52
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:29,530
I suppose it has nothing to do with Clerk Feng

53
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,290
but the raid on the Wuxian Sect.

54
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,740
Lately,

55
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,290
we've all been through a lot,

56
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,370
but be that as it may,

57
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,640
His Majesty's edict tops all.

58
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,659
As it falls under Internal Affairs,

59
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:56,880
Chief Xun,

60
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,220
tell us about the Wuxian Sect.

61
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,030
Yes.

62
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,660
Founded by remnants of Zhang Lu's clique,

63
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:11,370
Wuxian or Five Immortals came from five mythical creatures:

64
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,540
Hundun, Qiongqi, Taowu,

65
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,890
Taotie and Zhulong.

66
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,460
Their base is located in Mount Micang

67
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,570
where they meet irregularly.

68
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,180
According to our source,

69
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,300
they've been buying up

70
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,830
metal like steel all over the place since last year.

71
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,390
It's safe to say

72
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,240
that they're capable of making weapons.

73
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:31,910
How many are they?

74
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,460
They're scattered around,

75
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,680
roughly 10,000.

76
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:36,970
Is that number accurate?

77
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,200
Intelligence shows

78
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,540
that they've gathered over 30,000

79
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,020
from all walks of life

80
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,890
who are penetrating into all our departments.

81
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,830
Clerk Li,

82
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,540
is that number inflated?

83
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,560
Not at all.

84
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,620
Over the years,

85
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,659
when Prime Minister made

86
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,750
the Northern Expedition a top priority,

87
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,060
the Agency was too soft

88
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,210
towards the Wuxian Sect

89
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,170
that they took this chance to grow,

90
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:13,910
sided with the Intelligence Agency of Wei

91
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,520
and became bold enough to execute the Qingping Plan.

92
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:21,510
We're to blame.

93
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,260
We've put ourselves in peril!

94
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,290
Do we have any asset inside the Wuxian Sect?

95
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,950
Internal Affairs is keeping track of

96
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,060
their members on the periphery

97
00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:45,790
but the inner circle is ghostlike

98
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,290
and impenetrable.

99
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:50,360
Xun Xu,

100
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,500
I expected better than that.

101
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,130
I apologize.

102
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:02,240
Thankfully, General Li is able to

103
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,910
draw the court's attention to this.

104
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,300
His order is as thus:

105
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,530
The Agency shall work with General to Suppress the North,

106
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,710
Marquis of Village Du, Wei Yan,

107
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,980
and General to Pacify the North,

108
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,020
Governor of Hanzhong, Ma Dai,

109
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,940
to raid the Wuxian Sect from all directions

110
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,720
and wipe them out once and for all!

111
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:42,140
(Wuxian Sect, Border of the Shu State)

112
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:49,900
The terrain is quite similar

113
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,930
to that of the Military Technology Department

114
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,300
and so is the height of the cliff.

115
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,000
It's perfect for the trial.

116
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,940
If,

117
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,540
I mean if something goes wrong,

118
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,940
we can land on the lake

119
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,560
in emergency.

120
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:08,330
Safety is guaranteed.

121
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,020
Are you sure

122
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,070
about doing this?

123
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,470
Absolutely.

124
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,310
I'll be fine.

125
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,100
Elder Qin,

126
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,330
pick first and I'll use what's left.

127
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,020
After you, Mister Mi.

128
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,290
I've done this in Tianshui.

129
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,740
You should go first.

130
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,160
Please. Be my guest.

131
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,060
Appreciated.

132
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:27,640
Please.

133
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,440
The bamboo ropes are loose!

134
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,330
That would kill us!

135
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,550
Sorry. My bad.

136
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,320
Mister Mi,

137
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,250
I'll go with this one.

138
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,480
This here is also good.

139
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,420
I like this one.

140
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,120
It looks solid.

141
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:57,380
Fine.

142
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:58,500
Put it on then.

143
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,660
General Hu Zhong.

144
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,840
Please brief us on the operation.

145
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,370
General Li

146
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,690
has communicated with the two generals,

147
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,940
Ma Dai and Wei Yan.

148
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,580
20,000 crack troops from Hanzhong,

149
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,980
the garrison from Nanzheng led by the Agency

150
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,210
will besiege Mount Micang from three directions.

151
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,980
Their base is

152
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,890
in the Immortal Valley

153
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,070
cut by gullies and ravines.

154
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,600
General Wei's force will stream down the Mian River

155
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,750
while General Ma and his man will take the main route

156
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,780
to level their three sub-sects.

157
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,840
Clerk Li and I will command

158
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,990
the garrison from Nanzheng

159
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,590
to bring down their base.

160
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,990
Catch the leader and the gang will collapse.

161
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:06,220
Sect Leader, Huang Yu, must be seized,

162
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,220
alive or dead.

163
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,460
When shall we

164
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,820
set off?

165
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:16,660
In two hours.

166
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,380
From this moment on,

167
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,100
no one shall get out

168
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,260
without the badge from Clerk Li and me

169
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,520
for complete confidentiality.

170
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,760
Go and get prepared.

171
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,500
We'll leave in two hours.

172
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,260
-Yes, sir!

173
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,380
Elder Qin.

174
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:40,620
Before you dive,

175
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,470
spread the wings.

176
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,820
You'll need them in the air.

177
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,130
Just stay calm.

178
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,390
I've tried it on the ground many times.

179
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,330
I... I think I've got this.

180
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,470
Once you're up there,

181
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,390
be brave and you'll be fine.

182
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,350
Right.

183
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,480
Mister Mi,

184
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,710
you'll land safely, right?

185
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,420
I will. Trust me.

186
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,860
Mister Mi,

187
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,460
thanks for taking this risk.

188
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,820
You'll be rewarded the most

189
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,660
for our success.

190
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:13,610
That's very generous of you.

191
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:15,300
Let's go!

192
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,160
Leader, look!

193
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,300
Useless.

194
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:17,560
(Siwencao Intelligence in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

195
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:23,180
Chief Xun,

196
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,670
I know you're worried about Baidi.

197
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,360
He doesn't know the troops are coming

198
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,470
and could be killed in the crossfire.

199
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,980
Both him

200
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,360
and Di Yue are in danger.

201
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,090
Di Yue?

202
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,810
Who's that?

203
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,180
Baidi's wife,

204
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,790
my asset

205
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,120
planted in the Wuxian Sect three years ago

206
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,700
and accepted by the inner circle.

207
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,940
She's one of Huang Yu's most trusted members.

208
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,180
Is there a way to contact her?

209
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,260
Too late.

210
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,030
There must be something we can do.

211
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,050
There's one, actually.

212
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,300
Tip the Wuxian Sect off.

213
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,250
Are you aware of the consequence?

214
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,500
Any leak

215
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,220
and you'll be accused of treachery and treason!

216
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,420
Nothing you say will matter!

217
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,490
If Baidi gets killed,

218
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,420
so killed is our chance to get to Zhulong.

219
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,240
At this stage,

220
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,010
I'll have to

221
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,180
take my chances regardless.

222
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:44,800
Tangbing.

223
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:46,940
Are you all packed?

224
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,260
What's there to pack to the battlefield?

225
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:52,090
There's still time before we leave.

226
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,060
I'm here

227
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,540
to get some water.

228
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,740
A chief like you

229
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,140
has nothing to drink?

230
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,630
It's not worth it

231
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,400
to light the stove.

232
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,510
Did you notice

233
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,210
how strange

234
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,810
Xun Xu acted during the meeting?

235
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,930
Strange how?

236
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:18,530
I didn't see it.

237
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,980
Internal Affairs has been onto the Wuxian Sect

238
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,490
for years

239
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,170
but he seemed

240
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,990
to know nothing about them

241
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,660
and barely said anything useful.

242
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,050
That didn't make sense.

243
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,580
Are you saying

244
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,420
he's keeping something important from us?

245
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,060
Two years ago,

246
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,970
Clerk Feng once mentioned

247
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,280
that Xun Xu had

248
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,670
had someone at the top level.

249
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,120
And he didn't share it with us?

250
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,180
Why?

251
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,970
To take all the credit, of course.

252
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,700
You're close to him.

253
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,070
What do you think?

254
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,710
Xun Xu

255
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,180
can be a deep one

256
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,170
even in front of me.

257
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,900
Fall in! Fall in!

258
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,810
-We're leaving!
-Fall in!

259
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:23,980
Let's go.

260
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,290
March!

261
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,310
March!

262
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,880
General,

263
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,070
why use a cannon to kill flies?

264
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,970
A deterrent is necessary.

265
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,810
Any carelessness

266
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,220
and the Bamboo Kite would crash.

267
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:18,930
I'm sorry

268
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,130
for the loss of Elder Qin.

269
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,740
I'm glad you're fine.

270
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:36,570
Thanks for your concern.

271
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:42,080
Can the Bamboo Kite be fixed?

272
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,050
Chen Gong only taught me to assemble it.

273
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,370
Now that he's gone,

274
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:51,580
we won't be able to use it anymore.

275
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,120
Qin Ze's death

276
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,540
leaves me no choice

277
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,160
but to take up the task with you.

278
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,030
You can't, Leader!

279
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,720
The stakes are too high!

280
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,750
Even if you could use my kite,

281
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,420
I couldn't ensure your safety.

282
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:12,339
Leader,

283
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,680
give me the exact location of the design

284
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,099
and I'll get it out

285
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,849
at all costs.

286
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,960
I owe you a great debt of gratitude.

287
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,230
It's the least I should do.

288
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:32,250
Leader.

289
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:34,580
What's wrong?

290
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,600
Zhulong warned Miaofeng

291
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,880
that the Shu Army will attack us from three directions.

292
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,930
When?

293
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,110
Go ahead.

294
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,370
Chancellor Mi is one of us.

295
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:49,530
In ten days or so.

296
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,350
Ten days?

297
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,480
The Qingping Plan

298
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,110
will be initiated in three days

299
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,660
and we'll be out of here.

300
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,250
Do we need more lookouts outside?

301
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,230
Hold the mountain pass.

302
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,010
That's enough.

303
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,670
Yes.

304
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,280
What a shame.

305
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,250
We lost a Bamboo Kite.

306
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,280
We're deep in Mount Micang,

307
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:50,150
close to their base.

308
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:51,940
15 kilometers away?

309
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:53,680
A little more than that.

310
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,320
We can't get too close

311
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,960
or we'll be exposed.

312
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:58,820
Pass my order.

313
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,190
Yes, sir!

314
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,500
No fire, smoke or noise.

315
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,940
Violators will be executed!

316
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,060
Yes, sir!

317
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,480
Where are Wei Yan and Ma Dai?

318
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:13,850
They're already in position.

319
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,200
The raid

320
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,730
on the base and the sub-sects

321
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,150
will begin at five in the morning.

322
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,290
We'll dine at one,

323
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,410
leave at three

324
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,830
and reach the Immortal Valley at five.

325
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,330
We can send in two more scouts

326
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:32,020
to locate their posts.

327
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,950
Operations Department's men are already on it.

328
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,790
We'll hear from them after midnight.

329
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,660
Good.

330
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,330
Operations Department has sent out their spies.

331
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,760
Shall we act now?

332
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,820
Maybe later.

333
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,350
Do we have everything?

334
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,270
Yes, sir.

335
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,060
Chief Xun,

336
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,020
do think again.

337
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,700
Perhaps there's an alternative.

338
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,910
I have

339
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,950
and this is our only option.

340
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,130
If it goes wrong,

341
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,020
-I'll go to Clerk Li and defend your…
-No!

342
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,390
You must stay out of this.

343
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,310
Keep in mind our mission.

344
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,020
Seize Zhulong.

345
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:23,830
Yes, sir.

346
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,330
I've read the bamboo slip. It's coded.

347
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:36,300
Pass it to Xun Xu.

348
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,110
I will before midnight.

349
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:40,800
Be very careful.

350
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,410
Sorry to keep you waiting.

351
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,280
You're a busy man.

352
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,880
No need to apologize.

353
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,050
You used to live

354
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,660
a well-off life back in Tianshui,

355
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,640
but now, you barely have anything here.

356
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,740
I wish I could give you more.

357
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,220
I serve at pleasure.

358
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,000
These girls are called Qiuju and Yingchun.

359
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,620
They'll keep you company tonight.

360
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,900
You'll have to

361
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,140
put your life on the line

362
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,380
for an impossible mission in three days.

363
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:29,020
Have as much fun as you please

364
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:30,850
when there's still time.

365
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:34,900
That's very thoughtful of you.

366
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:36,810
Cheers.

367
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:30,810
Xun Xu!

368
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:31,780
Over here!

369
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:39,780
How are you?

370
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,410
I'm fine.

371
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:42,810
And Chen Gong?

372
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:43,780
He's safe.

373
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:45,450
That's a relief.

374
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,090
Our troops will flank the Wuxian Sect from three directions.

375
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,680
They're 15 kilometers away.

376
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:54,990
They'll set out at three and reach the Immortal Valley at five.

377
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:55,990
That's quick!

378
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,160
If I set this place on fire,

379
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,620
will the Sect's sentries notice it?

380
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:01,760
Yes.

381
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:02,820
Good.

382
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,160
I'll do so in one hour

383
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,380
after you leave.

384
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,930
You and Chen Gong must be extremely careful!

385
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,710
Do not get caught!

386
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:10,750
I know.

387
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:15,410
This is wood oil.

388
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,740
It's highly flammable.

389
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:18,570
Oh, wait!

390
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:19,350
Xun Xu.

391
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:21,810
Zhulong sent this to Huang Yu

392
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,860
who read and burned it.

393
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,020
I only managed to save half.

394
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:25,540
Chen Gong said it was coded.

395
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,380
He couldn't crack it.

396
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,180
Where are you on the Qingping Plan?

397
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,420
We'll act in three days.

398
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,280
Zhulong will show up at the end.

399
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:39,100
Finally!

400
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,460
Chen Gong will sneak into

401
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,700
the Military Technology Department

402
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:48,630
to steal the design

403
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,530
with a crack team.

404
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:54,260
Guards there will blow the whistle to alert everyone

405
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,090
and seal off the mountain and search it.

406
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,770
The Bamboo Kite will get Chen Gong out.

407
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:58,390
After landing,

408
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,260
he'll put the design at the drop spot

409
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,520
and Zhulong will pick it up.

410
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:05,920
It's our only chance to capture him.

411
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:07,940
What do you need me to do?

412
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,140
We need help from the outside

413
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,580
to unlock the back door in the head office

414
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,660
so that Chen Gong can get out.

415
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,150
What's Huang Yu thinking?

416
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,500
Are there no backups?

417
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,030
His plan was to jump off the cliff from the west

418
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:20,980
but that way,

419
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,840
Chen Gong would have to stick to his route

420
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,060
and lose control of the situation.

421
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:26,670
I see.

422
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,860
He's thorough.

423
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:30,780
Tell him

424
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,980
I'll take care of the back door.

425
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:33,910
Thanks.

426
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,390
Once he gets out,

427
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,760
shall I continue to stay?

428
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,600
Stay put and await my order.

429
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:51,830
Xun Xu,

430
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,060
I want to go home.

431
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,630
Hang in there a bit longer.

432
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,180
The court has made plans

433
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,760
to wipe out the Wuxian Sect.

434
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,660
They'll be implemented

435
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,490
once Zhulong is captured.

436
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,870
Then you can come home.

437
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,510
There, there.

438
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,560
Hang in there.

439
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,380
You'll be home soon.

440
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,660
I promise.

441
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:36,770
I have to go.

442
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:38,260
Take care.

443
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,270
I will.

444
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:57,990
(Li Yan's Camp in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

445
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,170
"The stars so dim,

446
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,610
the moon so bright.

447
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:30,800
Southbound birds are circling around the tree.

448
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:37,620
On which bough are you alight?"

449
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:51,730
Cao Cao is a traitor to the Han Dynasty

450
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,800
but he's endowed with literary talent.

451
00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:00,940
That poem of his is great.

452
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:04,460
Because you made it sound so.

453
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,010
It wasn't me,

454
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,580
but this qin.

455
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:18,910
Feng Ying,

456
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,440
where did you get it?

457
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,310
Sir,

458
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,840
during the Northern Expedition,

459
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:31,020
I followed Prime Minister to Tianshui

460
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,270
and confiscated a treasure house of Wei.

461
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:36,480
Those greedy Wei soldiers

462
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,740
robbed tombs all over the place to fund themselves.

463
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:40,910
This instrument was found in that house.

464
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,510
Someone told me from his expertise

465
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:47,980
that it was made by King Wen of Zhou.

466
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,180
I'd like you

467
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:53,490
to authenticate its origin.

468
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:56,440
It's too soon to tell

469
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,990
if King Wen made it,

470
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:05,330
but it's a famous one from Zhou and Shang,

471
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,240
called

472
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:09,230
Haozhong (Horn-bell).

473
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,130
Haozhong?

474
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,220
Why?

475
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,160
The sound of it is loud and clear

476
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:21,380
as that of the horn and the bell.

477
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,140
It's said the legendary qin player, Boya, played it.

478
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:30,170
Then it ended up in Lyu Shang's descendant of the 12th generation,

479
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,260
Duke Huan of Qi's hand.

480
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:36,280
This instrument

481
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:38,560
deserves someone like you

482
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:40,690
who appreciates it.

483
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,760
Feng Ying,

484
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,740
this is a gift from heaven.

485
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:48,870
Honestly,

486
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:53,450
in the eyes of the vulgar,

487
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,060
it's no more than a toy

488
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,120
to sit there and collect dust.

489
00:30:58,530 --> 00:30:59,960
But when you play it,

490
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:02,950
its sound echoes between heaven and earth,

491
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:07,980
cheering for our ultimate victory against Wu and Wei

492
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:10,070
and enduring reign

493
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,550
with your help!

494
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,550
The thought of it

495
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,900
gives me

496
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,920
great hope and confidence!

497
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,700
You know me

498
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:25,130
all too well!

499
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:27,100
Cheers!

500
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:28,130
Sir.

501
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:31,830
Fire!

502
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,310
Fire!

503
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,420
Elder Guan,

504
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,900
Temple of God of Mountains is on fire!

505
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:37,490
Go and check what's happening.

506
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,260
Yes, sir!

507
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:03,910
Beautiful! Incredibly beautiful!

508
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:07,190
I heard shining spears and armored horses,

509
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,870
sounding our triumph of this raid

510
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,220
on the Wuxian Sect.

511
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,530
We'll hear the good news in the morning.

512
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:18,020
The tune has said so.

513
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,870
Feng Ying,

514
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,310
let's drink again.

515
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:22,410
Sir.

516
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:28,440
I heard grandeur and majesty

517
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:32,150
from your melody.

518
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:35,110
Music can't be too strong or too soft.

519
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,280
Add the sound

520
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,900
of sheng

521
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,190
and that's harmony.

522
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,070
That won't be a problem, sir.

523
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:47,580
You don't know music

524
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,600
or how hard it is

525
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,950
to find such a talent.

526
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,630
It's almost impossible!

527
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:59,430
If you don't mind,

528
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,660
I have someone for you.

529
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,300
Why would I mind? I'd only be happy.

530
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:09,860
She...

531
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:14,200
She plays music at Ziyan House.

532
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,680
What does a harlot

533
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:20,760
know about the art of music?

534
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,140
Please hear me out.

535
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,940
Despite her humble background,

536
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,860
she's one of a kind,

537
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,360
talented and courageous.

538
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,500
Sir,

539
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,390
when I was hunted,

540
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,230
I hid under the seat in her carriage

541
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,080
and made my way out of Nanzheng.

542
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:45,990
I didn't know that.

543
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:49,560
If she's as good as you said,

544
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,030
I'd like to see her.

545
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,070
I'll set it up.

546
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,330
Let's drink.

547
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,949
Clerk, all the troops are assembled.

548
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:30,130
General Hu Zhong and the vanguard

549
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,270
are marching towards the Immortal Valley.

550
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:34,449
Set out!

551
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,420
Set out!

552
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,190
Report!

553
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:48,159
General Hu Zhong,

554
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:49,540
someone lit the place ahead to tip the enemy off.

555
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:49,900
How far are we from their base?

556
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,340
(Adjutant to Commander-in-chief of Shu, General Hu Zhong)
How far are we from their base?

557
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:51,530
(Adjutant to Commander-in-chief of Shu, General Hu Zhong)

558
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:53,230
Less than 2.5 kilometers from the Immortal Valley.
(Adjutant to Commander-in-chief of Shu, General Hu Zhong)

559
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:57,470
Storm in!

560
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,570
Full ahead! Kill those in the way!

561
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:00,680
No need to report!

562
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:01,240
Yes, sir!

563
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:04,240
Full ahead!

564
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:06,630
Kill those in the way! No need to report!

565
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,090
Full ahead!

566
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:10,750
Kill those in the way! No need to report!

567
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,430
Leader!

568
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:22,890
Leader!

569
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,210
What's with the rush?

570
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,330
Shu soldiers are marching towards us!

571
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:27,550
How far away?

572
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:29,580
Less than 2.5 kilometers from the Immortal Valley.

573
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,090
Let the vanguard buy us time.

574
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,180
We're leaving!

575
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,020
Yes, sir!

576
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,170
General Hu Zhong has broken the outer defense

577
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,260
and is fighting his way in.

578
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,410
Good!

579
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:15,860
Pass my order.

580
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:20,050
Those who killed their elders and leader

581
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,070
will received 100 taels of gold.

582
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:21,770
Yes, sir!

583
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:29,980
Tangbing.

584
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:33,150
The destruction of

585
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,470
the Wuxian Sect

586
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,970
is sheer bliss!

587
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:40,850
Of course they stand no chance

588
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:44,060
against our formidable army.

589
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:47,040
Actually,

590
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:49,620
this operation isn't

591
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,980
to eliminate one small cult.

592
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,530
No?

593
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,630
It's to prove

594
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,880
that our national policy of battling Wei

595
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:03,860
is wrong.

596
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,070
I'm enlightened.

597
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,860
Sir,

598
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:11,170
there's something more pressing

599
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,040
for your attention.

600
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,530
Feng Ying has resurfaced.

601
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,290
What?

602
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,290
Where is he?

603
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,420
In Nanzheng.

604
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,130
How did you know?

605
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,120
He asked to see me

606
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:26,230
and poured his heart out to me.

607
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,060
Chief Gao,

608
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:48,060
Feng Ying is still a wanted criminal.

609
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,490
Why didn't you arrest him

610
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:53,340
when he handed himself to you?

611
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:54,730
Clerk Li,

612
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,990
Clerk Feng,

613
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:58,530
no, Feng Ying was

614
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,090
my superior

615
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:02,230
and he knows our drill

616
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:04,160
better than anyone.

617
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,150
Besides, he wouldn't have shown up

618
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,150
unless he had to.

619
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:28,620
What did he say to you?

620
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,690
He...

621
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,220
Walls have ears.

622
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,280
Please be seated.

623
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,550
I saw Xun Xu.

624
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,170
Don't worry.

625
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:16,100
How far is it?

626
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,110
Almost there.

627
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:19,180
We'll be safe once out of the cave.

628
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:28,620
Have 20 men seal off the exit.

629
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,350
Yes, sir!

630
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,740
Go, go, go!

631
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:36,050
Feng Ying gave General Li the evidence

632
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,820
to bring down Yang Yi?

633
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,270
I have to hand it

634
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,300
to Feng Yi

635
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:45,990
for selling Yang Yi out!

636
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,730
But how come Hu Zhong said nothing to me?

637
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:53,260
Because...

638
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,720
Clerk Li,

639
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,900
General Li no longer needs you.

640
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,440
At this point,

641
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:13,090
I should let you know the truth.

642
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:21,340
Chief Gao,

643
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:27,240
you're playing us off against each other

644
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,060
for what?

645
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,230
I'm sent to kill you.

646
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:41,260
When the troops return in triumph,

647
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:44,950
you'll be considered a martyr.

648
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,130
How dare you!

649
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,630
I might not have known

650
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:58,190
if you sneaked up on me,

651
00:40:58,940 --> 00:40:59,820
but now...

652
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,140
I knew you'd try to fight back,

653
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:11,770
so I drugged your water to prevent it.

654
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,570
But, don't panic.

655
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:23,320
It wasn't poison

656
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,910
but anesthetic.

657
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,720
It'd take time to kick off,

658
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:36,880
so I told you all that.

659
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,080
I'm not skilled enough

660
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:46,010
to finish you with one shot.

661
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,720
I couldn't afford to miss and let you go,

662
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:52,730
so I had to numb you first.

663
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,850
Once frozen,

664
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:04,940
you'll be hit for sure.

665
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,150
May you rest in peace.

666
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:22,100
By the way, Feng Ying didn't win.

667
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:27,340
The real winner is us, the Wei State.

668
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:35,580
I am

669
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:38,280
Zhulong.

670
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:42,710
Surprise, surprise!

671
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,390
(The 24 Strategies of War, The Wind Blows from Longxi)
(Intelligence Agency in Longxi)

672
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,530
(The Eleventh Strategy To Catch Something, First Let It Go)

673
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:18,120
Oh, my God!

674
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:19,530
Liu Ying's handler is

675
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,260
Chief Gao,

676
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:23,460
also known as Zhulong!

677
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:24,500
He's been

678
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,390
working at the Agency longer than anyone

679
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,830
without giving away his real identity.

680
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:30,200
That man introduced Liu Ying to Feng Ying

681
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:31,950
and learned from Yin Ji

682
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:33,160
that the Agency had had someone

683
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:34,740
high up in the Wuxian Sect.

684
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,790
With all that information,

685
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,310
he must be

686
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:40,250
planning on something big.

687
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:42,060
Qingping Plan drawn up by Wei

688
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,080
and the Wuxian Sect is a go.

689
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:45,110
Meanwhile,

690
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,680
the Shu Army is

691
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:48,000
to erase the Wuxian Sect.

692
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:48,940
While they're battling each other,

693
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:50,400
Gao Tangbing has seized this chance

694
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:51,790
to kill Li Miao.

695
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:52,890
In cold blood!

696
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,610
And Chen Gong and Xun Xu are

697
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:57,390
wrapping up their covert operation

698
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,520
by capturing Zhulong.

699
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:01,500
Before the raid on the Wuxian Sect

700
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:02,460
began,

701
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,440
Xun Xu met with his sister, Di Yue,

702
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:06,920
to exchange information,

703
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:07,650
keep her and Chen Gong

704
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,280
from the battle

705
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,360
and catch Zhulong

706
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,640
in the end

707
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:13,930
despite the risk.

708
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:14,960
However,

709
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,980
Gao Tangbing

710
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:18,370
saw everything.

711
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:20,320
What is he going to do next?

712
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:21,100
Anyway,

713
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:22,020
aside from that,

714
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,390
Xun Xu managed to complete his task.

715
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:25,250
He put himself in harm's way

716
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:26,310
to send the message

717
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:28,230
to tip off the enemy

718
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:30,590
so that Chen Gong would be able to

719
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:32,350
finish the Qingping Plan

720
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,480
to lure Zhulong out

721
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,500
eventually.

722
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:38,320
What will Xun Xu's tip-off

723
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:40,260
lead to?

724
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,380
All in

725
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:44,790
my exclusive follow-up.
