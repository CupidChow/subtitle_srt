inform Guo Gang

10
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,380
of a spy's entering?

11
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,140
I could investigate that.

12
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,009
Start from here.

(Recorder of Tianshui, the Wei State)
(Chen Gong)

16
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,329
Chen Gong, why are you hiding here?

17
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,290
I'm looking for you.

18
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,610
Guo Gang, I'm surprised that

19
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,510
you can spare time for inspection.

20
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,530
What are you looking into?

21
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,160
(Governor of Tianshui, the Wei State)
(Guo Gang)

22
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,250
I'm checking the people
(Governor of Tianshui, the Wei State)
(Guo Gang)

23
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:07,280
(Governor of Tianshui, the Wei State)
(Guo Gang)

24
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,360

(Governor of Tianshui, the Wei State)
(Guo Gang)

25
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,500
Why are you checking that?

26
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:14,590
It's none of your business.

27
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,140
But Mi Chong...

28
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,300
Mi Chong looks at me

29
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,540
the way a dog looks at a bone.

30
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,820
I talked to him about this last night.

31
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:25,730
My advice,

32
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,010
better make friends than make enemies.

33
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,270
It's his duty to do so.

34
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:31,980
He had no option.

35
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,510
I don't want to make an enemy, either.

36
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,260
But, would he spare me?

37
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,680
Come on, he has promised me

38
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,740
that's the end of this matter.

39
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:42,829
He did it to retaliate against me.

40
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,350
Last year, I didn't approve

41
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,370
an illegal expenditure of the Military Intelligence Agency.

42
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,390
That's why he took revenge.

43
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,460
A petty man would think so.

44
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,150
Don't be small-minded, Chen Gong.

45
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,260
The Military Intelligence Agency gave him

46
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,829
a military order to solve the case.

47
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,300
Well, sometimes,

48
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:58,060
you also should understand Mi Chong.

49
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,420
I know you're in a quandary.

50
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,140
All right, all right.

51
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,470
It's just my duty.

52
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:03,290
I should be troubled, right?

53
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,090
How about

54
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,430
taking me out for some fun later?

55
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,100
Okay.

56
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,720
As long as you're interested,

57
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,630
of course I have the time.

58
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,870
I'm very interested.

59
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:18,930
Where's that thing?

60
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,610
By the way, I bring you a secret.

61
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,520
I'm listening.

62
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,620
And it's also about Baidi.

63
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,340
New intelligence from Zhulong.

64
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,550
Siwencao Intelligence of Shu

65
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,590
has sent a new spy,

66
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,640
who's called

67
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:40,900
Xun Xu.

68
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,270
It's said he brought a squad of Shu soldiers with him.

69
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,440
Again.

70
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,820
They may mean business this time.

71
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,970
Their goal for this trip

72
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,550
is to assassinate Baidi.

73
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,860
Are they crazy?

74
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,220
No, they're not.

75
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,920
Siwencao Intelligence believes that Baidi has betrayed them.

76
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,860
It has caused quite a stir.

77
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,300
And Shu is a mess now.

78
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,910
Actually, it's for the best.

79
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,180
We can watch our enemies fighting each other.

80
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,940
The wolf has a winning game when the shepherds quarrel.

81
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,060
No.

82
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,050
Baidi is a rather crafty devil.

83
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,890
I'll let Mi Chong follow this matter.

84
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,500
The spy from the state of Shu

85
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,290
would find Baidi for us.

86
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,620
The play last time was not well performed.

87
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,290
If we find the real Baidi this time,

88
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,390
Mi Chong won't have any problem with you.

89
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:32,770
That would be great.

90
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,900
I really want Mi Chong to stop pestering me.

91
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,390
Why is the Military Messengers' record here?

92
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,370
This scribe is an old fool.

93
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,670
I should get him beheaded!

94
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,210
(Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

95
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,580
(Siwencao)

96
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,410
General Li, Chief Yang, nice to meet you.

97
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,660
Siwencao Intelligence welcomes you.

98

(General who assists Shu, the Shu State)
(Li Yan)

99
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,550
General Li.

100
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:19,600
Inside, please.

101
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,750
Who are you?

102
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:27,130
(Clerk of Siwencao, the Shu State)
(Feng Ying)

103
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,250
Feng Ying of Siwencao Intelligence.
(Clerk of Siwencao, the Shu State)
(Feng Ying)

104
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,090
(Clerk of Siwencao, the Shu State)
(Feng Ying)

105
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,820
From today on,

106
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:46,470
(Chief of Staff to the Prime Minister, the Shu State)

(Chief of Staff to the Prime Minister, the Shu State)
(Yang Yi)

109
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,000
will administer Siwencao Intelligence.
(Chief of Staff to the Prime Minister, the Shu State)
(Yang Yi)

110
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:51,820
Everything

111
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,140
should be reported and made known

112
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:54,900
to General Li first

113
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,320
before it is reported to the imperial court.

114
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,290
Have I made myself clear?

115
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,220
Yes.

116
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,220
We'll report everything

117
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,220
in Siwencao Intelligence to General Li first.

118
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:16,800
Chief Yang

119
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,820
has been in charge of Siwencao Intelligence for years.

120
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,940
Everyone has had a good time here.

121
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,200
An easy life.

122
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,010
You must have gotten used to it.

123
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,350
His Majesty ordered me to rectify the situation.

124
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:35,570
The winter is coming.

125
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,640
I hope that

126
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,320
you could also get used to it.

127
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,380
I've heard that

128
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,400
Wei spies

129
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,590
have infiltrated this place.

130
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,650
And the Baidi you sent out is now a traitor.

131
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,870
His misinformation

132
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,530
caused the complete failure of the Northern Expedition.

133
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,230
Fellows.

134
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,670
Siwencao Intelligence

135
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,710
is now a broken system.

136
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,150
It needs repairing.

137
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,100
Feng Ying.

138
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:13,570
What's the real name

139
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,720
of this Baidi?

140
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:19,980
General Li.

141
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,950
This is top secret.

142
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,760
Please allow me to report it

143
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,280
to you in private later.

144
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,580
Look at him!

145
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,320
He's living proof.

146
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,170
Baidi has betrayed us.

147
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,380
What's the point of keeping his secret?

148
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,740
You're in a rut.

149
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,159
In the Wei State,

150
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,470
it's already made public.

151
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,740
But in our intelligence agency,

152
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,640
there are secrets and blockades.

153
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:43,870
What do you think you're doing?

154
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:48,480
General Li.

155
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,460
I mean, it's too long a story to be reported

156
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,390
at a time like this.

157
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,780
I'm afraid

158
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,000
it may delay your instructions.

159
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,080
I'm looking forward

160
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,280
to the story you're going to tell later.

161
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,310
Sit.

(Chen Gong’s Residence)
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

163
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,840
You look like a frail scholar.

164
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:15,160
I didn't expect you

165
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,250
(A Wei spy lurking in the Shu State)
(Lin Liang)

166
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:15,870
(Lin Liang)
I didn't expect you

167
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:15,160
(Lin Liang)

168
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,360
to be such a good horse keeper.
(A Wei spy lurking in the Shu State)
(Lin Liang)

169
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:17,850
to be such a good horse keeper.

170
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:20,190
I was once a navy soldier in Jingzhou

171
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,510
and fed the military horses for a few years.

172
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,310
I see.

173
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,250
Xun Xu?

174
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:27,750
Why did you get out?

175
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,860
I stayed in the attic for two days.

176
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,320
It's so boring. I couldn't stay there any longer.

177
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,130
Lin Liang, why didn't you stop him?

178
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,680
Have you forgotten the lesson last time?

179
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,340
Mr. Chen, you're right.

180
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,380
It's my fault.

181
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,560
Chen Gong, don't blame him.

182
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,860
I insist on coming out.

183
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:43,700
Don't worry.

184
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,230
I've checked around.

185
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:51,710
Nothing abnormal.

186
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,300
The time in Tianshui Messengers' record doesn't tally with

187
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,860
the actual time when Guo Gang got the intelligence

188
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,640
from Zhulong.

189
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,570
This Zhulong hides so well.

190
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,700
It's not easy to find him.

191
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,790
Today I heard

192
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,980
some unexpected news.

193
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,600
What is it?

194
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,470
Guo Gang said that Zhulong had sent new intelligence again.

195
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,480
What is it about?

196
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,030
It has a name and a goal.

197
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,970
It's about your coming to Tianshui.

198
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,160
Very few people know about my coming here.

199
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,920
In Siwencao Intelligence,

200
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,020
there's no secret now.

201
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:36,650
But that was too fast.

202
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,840
If we can't uncover Zhulong,

203
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,470
both you and I

204
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,750
will be screwed.

205
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:44,700
(Siwencao)
(Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

206
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,270
This time, I've come
(Siwencao)
(Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

207
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:46,860
(Siwencao)
(Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

208
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,450
to set some rules first.
(Siwencao)
(Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

209
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,130
to set some rules first.

210
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:49,780
First,

211
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,940
within Siwencao Intelligence,

212
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,030
no one shall form any clique.

213
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,670
Second,

214
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,120
the competent get promoted

215
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,280
while the mediocre step down.

216
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:00,940
Third,

217
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,990
clean up the hidden threats inside

218
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,530
and root out spies from the Wei.

219
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,390
Get each and every one of them out!

220
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:08,720
Get to the bottom

221
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,210
of Baidi's betrayal

222
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,950
and the moles

223
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,880
hiding inside Siwencao Intelligence.

224
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,350
Once I spot one, I'll kill one!

225
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:17,870
No one will be spared!

226
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,250
Based on our current situation,

227
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,420
it's way too hard to find Zhulong.

228
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,290
For all the time, we think that

229
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,240
Guo Gang is transmitting intelligence

230
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,940
through the Military Messenger of the Wei State, right?

231
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,250
That's possible.

232
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,660
Is it possible

233
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:41,740
that Zhulong

234
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,290
is using our channels?

235
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,580
Think about it.

236
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,460
He has gone deep into Siwencao Intelligence.

237
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,390
He's totally able to do so.

238
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,820
It looks like we must investigate your contacts.

239
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,290
Gu Zheng

240
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,680
is my exclusive contact.

241
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,640
His overt identity is the owner of a carriage shop.

242
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,970
Does this Gu Zheng

243
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,070
know about your identity?

244
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,490
No, he doesn't.

245
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:11,260
He just knows about the code name, Baidi.

246
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,340
(A spy in the Shu State)
(Gu Zheng)

247
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,970
(Gu Zheng)
He just knows about the code name, Baidi.

248
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:11,260
(Gu Zheng)

249
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,310
But he doesn't know it's me.
(A spy in the Shu State)
(Gu Zheng)

250
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,640
How do you exchange intelligence?

251
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,230
We place it in a designated spot

252
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,470
without meeting each other.

253
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,990
Sometimes I go there and sometimes Lin Liang does.

254
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,880
Grains and groceries.

255
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,260
(Market in Tianshui, the Wei State)
Grains and groceries.

256
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,080
(Market in Tianshui, the Wei State)

257
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,310
Sir, any salt?

258
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,360
Yes.

259
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,090
From Baoyuan.

260
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,710
Witch salt in small pots.

261
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,260
Private goods.

262
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,120
Good.

263
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,320
Try it.

264
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,560
Okay. I want one kilo.

265
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,300
It must be their way of communication.

266
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,470
Yeah.

267
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,040
But the meaning is confusing.

268
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,310
Who put it there?

269
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,590
We tailed Gu Zheng

270
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,140
and then found this spot by accident.

271
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,620
We didn't see the person

272
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,030
that placed the stones.

273
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,920
Get some men to keep an eye on it

274
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,850
day and night.

275
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:37,700
(Chancellor of the Tianshui Military Intelligence Agency of Wei)
(Mi Chong)

276
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,540
Don't leave any blind spots.
(Chancellor of the Tianshui Military Intelligence Agency of Wei)

(Chancellor of the Tianshui Military Intelligence Agency of Wei)
(Mi Chong)

278
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,860
Yes, I'm on it.
(Chancellor of the Tianshui Military Intelligence Agency of Wei)
(Mi Chong)

279
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:40,490
What to do with Zhulong's intelligence provided by the Governor?

280
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,410
(The Tianshui Military Intelligence Agency of Wei)
(Liang Jian)
What to do with Zhulong's intelligence provided by the Governor?

281
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,620
Zhulong's intelligence has always been correct.

282
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,820
But there're no details this time.

283
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,620
There are tens of thousands of people in Tianshui.

284
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,950
But all we know is a name,

285
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:53,930
which may even not be real.

286
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,400
It's a needle in a haystack.

287
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,970
The man called Xun Xu

288
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,060
is also likely to meet with Gu Zheng.

289
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,630
Oh, I see.

290
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:03,790
Spread the net.

291
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,050
I don't allow any mistakes.

292
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,330
Yes.

(Sun Ling)

What do you want? Just say it.

301
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,860
Feng Ying.

302
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,620
Feng Ying, today,

303
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,800
Li Yan deliberately acted like that to warn us.

304
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,100
Do your work well.

305
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,470
Don't talk about the imperial decisions.

306
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:37,200
It's so boring to do the transcription all day

307
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,010
in the scribe room.

308
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,260
The scribe room is the center.

309
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,610
It's not a sinecure.

310
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,740
It's not the major business of Siwencao Intelligence.

311
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,120
There's no future for this.

312
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,240
I still want to get some real work.

313
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,360
The work of every department is for professional people.

314

317
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:09,260
neither is for me.

318
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,590
Well,

319
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,030
the Internal Affairs Department is good.

320
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,650
They just maintain order and collect all sorts of fees.

321
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,080
And no special requirement.

322

323
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,660
Chief of Internal Affairs Department has been vacant for a year.

324
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,720
It's time to get a new chief.

325
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,430
And didn't you hear what Li Yan said?

326
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,930
The competent get promoted while the mediocre step down.

327
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,330
For Chief of Internal Affairs Department,

328
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,500
Xun Xu is the best candidate.

329
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,610
Besides,

330
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,100
the agency is to be reshuffled.

331
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,990
I won't be the one to decide.

332
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,170
Is Xun Xu capable of it?

333
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,370
He always looks spiritless.

334
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,540
I think he must be a coward.

335
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,900
An investigation will be conducted to find the mole.

336
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,360
Think twice before you do or say anything.

337
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,140
Don't talk nonsense all day.

338
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:56,920
I know that.

339
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,550
All right. Leave me alone.

340
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,230
Yes.

341
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:10,900
Feng Ying.

342
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,820
What now?

343
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,260
You have a guest.

344
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,280
Feng Ying.

345
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,220
Li Yan is to reshuffle the agency.

346
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,270
We're going to have a hard time

347
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:32,450
in Siwencao Intelligence.

348
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,100
I,

349
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,570
am loyal to the prime minister

350
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,340
and sincere to you.

351
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,530
I'll overcome

352
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,030
whatever difficulties ahead.

353
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,950
Why is the case

354
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,400
of Baidi's betrayal still not over?

355
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,550
I've sent Xun Xu there.

356
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,540
The current situation is tense.

357
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,550
Baidi must be in a panic.

358
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:02,720
It will take some time

359
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,190
to deal with it.

360
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,220
Feng Ying,

361
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,619
given the current situation,

362
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:10,339
could you please be honest with me?

363
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,180
The reason why you sent Xun Xu there

364
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,250
is to help Baidi survive this.

365
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,349
Am I right?

366
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,180
Now that we've talked about it,

367
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,250
I'll just admit it.

368
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:34,590
Yang Yi.

369
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,580
The situation is far more complicated than we could imagine.

370
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,990
In the past three years, Baidi has performed deeds of merit.

371
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,720
About the loss of Jieting Fortress, the truth hasn't been found out.

372
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,280
I really

373
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,720
don't want him to die in a foreign land.

374
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:52,260
Of course I understand all this.

375
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,140
I asked you to close the case

376
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,200
to stop Jieting case from expanding.

377
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,270
You also heard Li Yan today.

378
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,010
He's going to make an issue of it.

379
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,230
I don't care

380
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,940
how cold and unrighteous I am

381
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:05,700
in your eyes.

382
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,470
But, Feng Ying, let me remind you

383
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,650
that political struggle is quite cruel.

384
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,030
You save one person today,

385
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,650
and you'll lose more men tomorrow.

386
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,520
What it harms in the end is the foundation of our country.

387
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,700
You're completely right.

388
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:30,860
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

389
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,940
Come on, cheers.

390
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,300
One more cup.

391
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,370
Come on.

392
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,770
Wow, you drink a lot.

393
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:48,190
Mr. Lyu, you poured me so many cups.

394
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,820
Go.

395
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,540
Good spirits.

396
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,840
Have they run away?

397
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,230
That's impossible.

398
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,960
Didn't you see

399
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,750
that he was so drunk?

400
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,350
He's enjoying food and drinks inside.

401
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,180
We're the mosquitos' drinks in the cold wind.

402
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,230
Stop complaining.

403
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,710
Keep your eyes peeled.

404
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:27,990
If anything goes wrong,

405
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,090
I'll hold you two responsible.

406
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,320
Yes.

407
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,700
Let's investigate it from Gu Zheng.

408
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,620
I'll go to meet him.

409
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,870
I'm a spy from Siwencao Intelligence.

410
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,310
So I can ask him questions face to face.

411
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,890
If there's anything wrong with him,

412
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,750
you can't stay here any longer.

413
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,730
Once we find the evidence, arrest Gu Zheng immediately.

414
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,990
And we'll return to the Hanzhong region without any delay.

415
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:12,950
Um.

416
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:16,400
And we must notify our people on Xiaolong Mountain

417
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,880
to go to our hideaway

418
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,020
to assist you.

419
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,200
Alright.

420
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,980
Yang Yi, let me walk you to the posthouse.

421
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:49,800
Not necessary.

422
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,950
My carriage is right outside.

423
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,110
I'll get back to Chengdu tonight.

424
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,010
Why in such a hurry?

425
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,200
Feng Ying.

426
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,880
There is no intact egg under the fallen nest.

427
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:01,970
Keep that in mind.

428
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,150
Good bye.

429
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,390
You haven't gone to bed yet?

430
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,780
Feng Ying, be decisive.

431
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,980
Don't you get the meaning of Yang Yi's words?

432
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:34,750
Li Yan is investigating Baidi to topple the prime minister.

433
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,160
In order to close the case, Baidi must die.

434
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,100
Yang Yi knows it well

435
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,250
that you...

436
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,240
you want to save Baidi.

437
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,350
What Yang Yi said

438
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:47,720
is all top secret.

439
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,460
You shall not say a word after you step out of the door.

440
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,640
Come on.

441
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,820
I'm just talking about it between us.

442
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,680
Competence alone is not enough to be an official.

443
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,250
Even though Baidi is innocent,

444
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,070
you must make him a traitor now.

445
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,800
Where did you learn those dirty tricks?

446
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,670
You...

447
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:08,420
Feng Ying,

448
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,190
don't be so stubborn.

449
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,610
We must do everything to restore the Han Dynasty.

450
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,180
Stop. Get back to your room.

451
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,080
Go to sleep.

452
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,470
Tell me about restoring the Han Dynasty!

453
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,150
Go home and have a rest.

454
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,680
The intelligence for Chidi has been sent out.

455
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,160
I was worried the whole night.

456
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,650
But I got a new task from Baidi.

457
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,170
Baidi?

458
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,180
Has he revived so soon?

459
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,380
It's an emergency.

460
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,840
Our informant

461
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:07,230
has been exposed.

462
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:09,190
And he has important intelligence

463
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,660
for me to send back to the Hanzhong region.

464
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,780
This time I must do it myself.

465
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,890
The latest intelligence intercepted by the Governor last night.

466
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,010
The leader of the squad infiltrating into Tianshui is surnamed Jin.

467
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,860
They answer to Xun Xu.

468
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:30,180
All in disguise?

469
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,780
Not just that.

470
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,620
They're equipped with the armor of our army.

471
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,540
Recorder,

472
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,790
it's a big cost for Siwencao Intelligence.

473
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,000
Everyone!

474
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:46,820
Yes.

475
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,520
Go check all the access registration of every gate

476
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,060
within the last ten days. Don't miss anything.

477
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:52,860
Yes!

478
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,410
Go!

479
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,980
We verified the entry and exit permit. No problem with it.

480
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,860
Why did they enter the city?

481
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:15,210
They said they were guards of the Commander's Mansion

482
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,060
and they were on a secret mission.

483
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,500
So we didn't ask for the details.

484
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,710
They entered and left with a carriage covered by a curtain.

485
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,360
Pretty mysterious.

486
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,210
Carriage?

487
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,480
Did you check it?

488
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,120
We searched it when they entered the city.

489
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,150
It was empty then.

490
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:30,010
It was a carriage of the Commander's Mansion, so...

491
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,020
This mysterious carriage

492
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,760
was likely to be connected with Baidi.

493
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,140
I'll bring soldiers to Xiaolong Mountain

494
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,660
to find this squad from Shu.

495
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:47,370
Those men are not enough.

496
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,890
Only the garrison could help.

497
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:49,870
You.

498
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:51,630
Go to the Governor and tell him

499
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,000
to dispatch some garrison soldiers from outside the city

500
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,310
to box and search the mountain and bring some dogs.

501
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,070
Yes.

502
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,620
You stay inside the city.

503
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:00,700
Keep a close eye on Gu Zheng.

504
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,490
Yes.

505
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:05,210
Soldiers, fall in!

506
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,130
Now!

507
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:06,850
Go.

508
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,190
Everyone, fall in!

509
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,540
Go, hurry.

510
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:21,510
Move!

511
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,470
After you get there,

512
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,110
send me a letter.

513
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,130
It's not my first time taking that route.

514
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,230
I'll be back in a few days.

515
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,750
I just feel worried.

516
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:39,780
It's all right.

517
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,060
Everything will be fine.

518
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:47,390
When the prime minister retakes the city,

519
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,170
everything will be fine.

520
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:08,790
Go.

521
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,690
Could we make a detour?

522
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,370
There's only one path

523
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:42,730
down the hill from here.

524
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:45,850
And the Wei must have mobilized a thousand soldiers.

525
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,220
We're trapped.

526
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,400
Then we'll have to go back.

527
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,780
We must cross that ridge

528
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,470
before the Wei soldiers arrive.

529
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:56,340
And you'll find three paths

530
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,300
leading to Baoxie Road connecting the Hanzhong region.

531
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:00,940
What matters now

532
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,580
is that you must go back to inform Baidi of the situation.

533
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,340
We're like fishes

534
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,180
trapped in a pot.

535
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,980
We'll distract the Wei troops

536
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,040
to cover you.

537
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,010
But...

538
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,360
At this critical moment,

539
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,220
there's no time for that. Go!

540
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:39,610
Spread out.

541
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,650
Chancellor!

542
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,590
Here.

543
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,730
Come on.

544
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:02,160
Right here.

545
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:20,090
(The old street in the west town)
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

546
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:25,920
What's up?

547
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,870
Someone is stalking us.

548
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,340
Take a bustling route.

549
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:57,370
No one inside.

550
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,360
Get down here.

551
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:03,780
Where's the person inside?

552
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:04,820
There's no one in.

553
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,950
Tell all the men being sent out to strengthen the control.

554
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:11,810
Yes.

555
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:13,700
Report.

556
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,380
What's wrong?

557
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:15,780
Gu Zheng suddenly disappeared

558
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,000
from our monitoring.

559
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:17,820
Which area?

560
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:20,170
Here.

561
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,550
At our spot in the old town in the west of the city.

562
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:22,940
Now.

563
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,930
Report it to Chancellor Mi.

564
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:25,700
Yes.

565
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:28,340
Get some men to look for him.

566
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:29,840
Don't let him escape.

567
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,480
Yes.

568
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,380
(Tingsong House)
(The old town of Tianshui, the Wei State)

569
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,150
Sir, inside, please.
(Tingsong House)
(The old town of Tianshui, the Wei State)

570
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:35,220
(Tingsong House)
(The old town of Tianshui, the Wei State)

571
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,850
Come in, please.
(Tingsong House)
(The old town of Tianshui, the Wei State)

572
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:37,390
(Tingsong House)
(The old town of Tianshui, the Wei State)

573
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:38,140
Welcome.
(Tingsong House)
(The old town of Tianshui, the Wei State)

574
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:38,970
(Tingsong House)
(The old town of Tianshui, the Wei State)

575
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,030
Leave us.

576
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,290
Mr. Gu.

577
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,540
Yes, I'm Gu Zheng.

578
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,800
I'm Heidi from Luoyang.

579
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,940
I can't tell you my real name.

580
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,390
Please forgive me.

581
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:40,470
I understand.

582
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,550
It happened so suddenly.

583
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,050
Mr. Gu, thank you for your help.

584
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,460
3:45 am.

585
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:49,290
At the intersection of Zhuque Street and Gong Lane,

586
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,400
some will pick you up.

587
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:51,250
At dawn,

588
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,260
the gate will open and you'll get out of town.

589
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,550
Chancellor Mi.

590
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,070
Report.

591
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,160
Yes.

592
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,060
We found Gu Zheng meeting with Baidi.

593
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:07,210
General Fu,

594
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,670
I need to go back to town for an urgent military affair.

595
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:10,930
Don't worry.

596
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,380
I'll take care of the Shu soldiers in the mountain.

597
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:13,150
Yes.

598
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:15,850
I want a few of them alive.

599
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:16,910
Yes.

600
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,130
Why did you come?

601
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:32,550
Bad news.

602
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,810
3:45 am.

603
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:37,490
At the intersection

604
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,050
of Zhuque Street and Gong Lane.

605
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,400
You aren't from Luoyang.

606
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,490
Mr. Gu, why did you say that?

607
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:49,730
Save it.

608
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,230
You still smell of the sachet of the Shu region.

609
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,470
You just left the Hanzhong region for less than half a month.

610
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,110
Mr. Gu, I'm impressed.

611
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:01,750
Tell me,

612
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:03,600
what do you want from me

613
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,260
for taking the trouble to do so?

614
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,100
Feng Ying sent me.

615
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,760
My name is Xun Xu.

616
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,660
Deputy Chief of Internal Affairs Department.

617
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,830
Why should I trust you?

618
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,840
I've met Baidi.

619
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,340
He verified my identity.

620
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:22,670
And he gave this to me.

621
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,030
Why did you choose to meet me this way?

622
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,340
In case there's something wrong with you.

623
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:28,730
If you were a traitor,

624
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,330
you would bring people of the Military Intelligence Agency here.

625
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,840
This is a test.

626
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:44,150
If I were, would you be able to get away?

627
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,390
I arranged some servants.

628
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:50,140
They would warn me if things were not right.

629
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,610
But somehow,

630
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,960
they didn't come.

631
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,960
I don't know what happened.

632
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,330
You're very honest.

633
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:10,410
I'm ashamed, Mr. Gu.

634
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,750
You saw through my trick right after our meeting.

635
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:19,990
Brothers.

636
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,060
They're ahead.

637
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:21,790
Come on.

638
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,300
Yeah.

639
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,200
Search!

640
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,500
Don't miss any single spot.

641
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:48,320
The Wei army has been attracted here.

642
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,780
And they have dogs.

643
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:51,250
We

644
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,000
can't hide for long.

645
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,920
We also can't run very far.

646
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,440
The enemy

647
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:02,010
will catch up very soon.

648
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,159
It's a nice day.

649
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,219
There's no way out.

650
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:17,960
We'll sacrifice for our country.

651
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:19,820
After death,

652
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,179
we can't still wear the enemy's armor.

653
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:53,070
Kill them!

654
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,880
Capture them alive.

655
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:17,980
Forever enemy.

656
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:38,310
At that time, the gate of Shanggui County was closed.

657
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,880
I thought of many ways to get out.

658
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:43,300
The intelligence was delivered on time in the end.

659
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,010
It's your credit.

660
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:47,120
But it was false information.

661
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,700
After the military failure of the prime minister,

662
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:53,090
I also thought of it.

663
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,580
Baidi might have fallen into the trap

664
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,090
set by the Military Intelligence Agency of the Wei State.

665
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:57,600
No.

666
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,180
Baidi's intelligence was correct.

667
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,190
Zhang He's troop

668
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,700
would attack Jieting Fortress at night by taking Fanxu Road.

669
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,190
Correct?

670
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,730
But you just said it was false information.

671
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,180
It was replaced with false information

672
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:11,880
before it was sent to the prime minister.

673
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,070
How's that possible?

674
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,880
Baidi's intelligence is encrypted.

675
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,680
You've opened it?

676
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:23,250
Never.

677
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,260
Then how did you know it's encrypted?

678
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:28,140
It's a usual practice for Siwencao Intelligence to encrypt all the information.

679
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,990
For spies of Baidi's level, a special code is used.

680
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:33,290
There's a decryption engraving for this special code.

681
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,350
You...

682
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,920
What do you mean?

683
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:40,620
(The old street in the west town)
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

684
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,410
Search!
(The old street in the west town)
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

685
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:41,450
(The old street in the west town)
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

686
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,090
Move!
(The old street in the west town)
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

687
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:43,730
(The old street in the west town)
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

688
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:44,150
You, this side.
(The old street in the west town)
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

689
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,000
You, this side.

690
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:46,240
You come with me.

691
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:48,810
Open your bag.

692
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,430
You, stop!

693
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,080
No one gets out.

694
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,780
Arrest everyone

695
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:55,680
who looks suspicious.

696
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:56,340
Yes.

697
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:57,690
You can't get inside.

698
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:58,580
I'm looking for someone.

699
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,260
Leave now.

700
00:36:59,260 --> 00:36:59,860
I'm looking for someone.

701
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,430
Yes.

702
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:01,580
-What is this about?
-Leave now.

703
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,560
Why are you closing the road?

704
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:03,590
The old town is blocked.

705
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:04,490
No one shall get in or out.

706
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,560
Don't you know who I am?

707
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,630
Back off.

708
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,750
Recorder Chen.

709
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:10,510
What's this?

710
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:11,680
What's happening?

711
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,250
Sorry, Recorder Chen.

712
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,690
Some spy from the Shu State

713
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,910
is making trouble in the old town.

714
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:17,850
It's unsafe for you to get inside now.

715
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,680
Unsafe?

716
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,220
Who do you think you are?

717
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,280
How dare you get in my way?

718
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,460
I'm sorry.

719
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,340
Please, Recorder Chen.

720
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,200
Recorder Chen.

721
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:29,130
Recorder Chen, you look pissed off.

722
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:31,370
Chancellor Mi, you're finally back.

723
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,650
You made Recorder Chen unhappy. Apologize.

724
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,230
Yes.

725
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,750
Don't. I'm good.

726
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:37,980
I have work to do.

727
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,960
But, even if the Governor came today,

728
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,270
he wouldn't stop me from arresting the spy.

729
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:46,970
We've ascertained

730
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:48,260
that Gu Zheng is blocked in the old town.

731
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,900
Recorder Chen, where are you going?

732
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,680
The old town is unsafe now.

733
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,100
Let me escort you.

734
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:57,740
No, not necessary.

735
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:58,660
I'll escort you.

736
00:37:59,540 --> 00:37:59,880
Please.

737
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:00,510
Clear the way.

738
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,290
Please.

739
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:27,490
Chief Xun, so you came to Tianshui

740
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,980
to frame me.

741
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:31,010
I just want to find out the truth.

742
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,280
If what you just said is true,

743
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:34,870
why are you so nervous?

744
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:37,040
No one has ever read the intelligence

745
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,120
sent by Baidi.

746
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,990
What made you think that it was replaced?

747
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,710
Baidi said it himself.

748
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,240
Baidi's special code is unparalleled.

749
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:50,330
Who could crack it?

750
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:53,760
What if Baidi's intelligence itself was false?

751
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:56,570
How to explain that?

752
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:59,510
Then I have to bring you two back to the Hanzhong region together

753
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:02,350
and let you confront each other face to face.

754
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,850
That's ridiculous.

755
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:16,240
Excuse me.

756
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,050
You can't leave.

757
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,350
Mr. Gu, the Military Intelligence Agency

758
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:23,410
has surrounded the old town.

759
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,650
They're about to break in.

760
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,730
How do you explain it now?

761
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,470
I'm framed!

762
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:38,350
There's not much time left.

763
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,590
Lin Liang, we must take him with us.

764
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:42,490
He's the key to solving the Jieting case.

765
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,400
Don't push me.

766
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,210
I'm a decent man.

767
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,050
I've been risking my life for the Han Dynasty.

768
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:53,610
I'd rather die

769
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:56,080
than be insulted and framed by you.

770
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:52,420
Please.

771
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:01,260
Five, five, five.

772
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,570
Gold, gold.

773
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:07,100
Your treat.

774
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:09,620
Recorder Chen, what took you so long?

775
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,340
You must drink for being late.

776
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,470
Chancellor Mi.

777
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:12,790
Our bet is small.

778
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,850
Not big at all.

779
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,580
I said there was a party.

780
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:17,570
Chancellor Mi didn't buy it

781
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:19,360
so he came to have a look.

782
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,810
Chancellor Mi,

783
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:21,830
would you like to join us?

784
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:22,660
Have a seat?

785
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:23,510
I'm good.

786
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,680
I don't know how to play.

787
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,780
Enjoy, Recorder Chen.

788
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:28,630
Sure.

789
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:32,650
Have fun.

790
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,200
Chancellor Mi, at your right.

791
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:03,720
Don't touch it.

792
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,820
There must be poison on the dagger.

793
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:17,460
Where's Recorder Chen?

794
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,210
Gambling.

795
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:21,040
He's having fun.

796
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:24,140
He picked up a quarrel with us just now.

797
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:25,150
As I see it,

798
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:26,490
he was trying to stall us.

799
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:27,490
Isn't that obvious?

800
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:29,020
Or why would he organize

801
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,410
a gambling party here?

802
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:38,440
Did the murderer escape through the window?

803
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,350
The corpse is still warm.

804
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:44,660
He's still nearby.

805
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:48,610
This fish is also home.

806
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,000
Money, give me money.

807
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:50,810
-Recorder Chen.
-You win again!

808
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,740
You're unstoppable today.

809
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:54,580
Yeah.

810
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,250
Waiter.

811
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,260
Bring us

812
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:02,880
two jars of the best drink.

813
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:03,790
Drink as much as you like.

814
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:04,700
Drink.

815
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,710
Come on.

816
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:09,080
Come on, let's continue.

(The Third Strategy)
(Ingenious Escape)

819
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:17,780
As you know, Chen Gong

820
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:19,580
has an agent called Gu Zheng

821
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:22,170
to facilitate his work in the Wei State.

822
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,230
Xun Xu invited him to a restaurant

823
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,140
to test his loyalty.

824
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:27,630
As they confronted with each other,

825
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:28,790
Mi Chong and his men

826
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:29,980
raided the restaurant

827
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:30,910
to capture Baidi.

828
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:31,890
Our prime suspect,

829
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:32,830
Mr. Gu Zheng,

830
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,300
killed himself

831
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:35,320
to prove his innocence.

832
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:38,240
The only lead to the mole

833
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:40,340
is gone.

834
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:43,410
Thanks to Chen Gong's gambling party...

835
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:44,160
Waiter.

836
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:45,240
as a distraction,

Two jars of the best drink.

838
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:48,120
Xun Xu broke free

839
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:49,560
successfully

840
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:50,990
right under Mi Chong's nose.

841
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:54,750
What an ingenious escape!

842
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:56,040
However,

843
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:58,470
Gu Zheng didn't die for nothing.

844
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:00,980
Before he died, he said

845
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:02,930
he had a handler, named Chidi.

846
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,500
It further convinced Chen and Xun

847
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,000
that Zhulong was in the Shu State.

848
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:08,260
Back in the Shu State,

849
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:09,700
General Li Yan finished

850
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,600
the complete takeover of Siwencao Intelligence.

851
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:13,510
Feng Ying disapproved my job reassignment.

852
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:14,220
Well, thanks to that,

853
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,420
I'm promoted.

854
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:17,580
Well, to some extent,

855
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,730
General Li has a good eye for talent.

856
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,700
So,

857
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:22,590
who is Chidi

858
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:23,760
that Gu Zheng confessed?

859
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:25,920
What will Chen Gong do

860
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:27,810
to prove his innocence despite more difficulties?

861
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:30,010
And how will Feng Ying deal with

862
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:32,380
Li Yan, the new leader of Siwencao?

863
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:33,180
My advice,

864
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,200
just quit, Feng Ying.

865
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:37,110
I got your back.
