(The Twenty-fourth Strategy, Take the Blame for Someone Else)

3
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,180
Commandants!

4
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,039
Here!

5
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,180
Ready to attack

6
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,580
and catch the suspect alive.

7
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,660
Aye!

8
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:44,850
Chief Xun.

9
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,230
No offense, Chief Xun,

10
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,490
but I've captured the suspect alive in the room.

11
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,190
I interrogated him just now

12
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,750
and I must report it to Prime Minister immediately.

13
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,160
I'll take my leave.

14
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,040
Xun Xu,

15
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,800
I've been waiting for you.

16
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,140
Why?

17
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,160
I'm asking you.

18
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,220
Take him away!

19
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:03,070
(Path outside the Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

20
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,540
General Li Yan, how have you been?

21
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,670
General Ma Dai,

22
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,580
do you need so many soldiers to catch me?

23
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,740
I still call you General Li.

24
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,190
If you feel ashamed,

25
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,170
go back with me

26
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,630
and await your punishment.

27
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,620
Since I followed

28
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,990
the late emperor,

29
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,120
I've been loyal.

30
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,380
The late emperor entrusted His Majesty to me in Baidi City.

31
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,810
I've been loyal to our state.

32
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:02,850
And I fully intend

33
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,130
to destroy the Wei and Wu States.

34
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,710
I'm not as persuasive as Zhuge Liang.

35
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:10,840
However,

36
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:12,960
I have never

37
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,940
changed my loyalty!

38
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,270
General, there's no use in arguing.

39
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,900
You'd better surrender!

40
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,810
Fine, then.

41
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,390
Take me to Zhuge Liang!

42
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,580
Take me to Zhuge Liang!

43
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,480
(One month later)

44
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:15,650
(after General Wang Shuang of Wei was beheaded and Yinping and Wudu were resumed.)
(Due to Li Yan's rebellion, Zhuge Liang withdrew his army of 200,000 soldiers quietly to the Hanzhong Region and Chengdu)

45
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,210
You say there's irrefutable evidence of Li Yan's rebellion.

46
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,580
What is the evidence? Tell me about it.

47
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,290
Prime Minister,

48
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,420
Li Yan colluded with Wei spies

49
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,580
and divulged our military intelligence.

50
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:33,580
What's worse,

51
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:37,020
he had soldiers in Jiangzhou disguised as the Wu Army and invade our state.

52
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:40,180
He also transported the army provisions to Jiangzhou without permission,

53
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,680
trying to cut off the route of your retreat.

54
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,490
They had a three-step plan.

55
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,560
We have Hu Zhong's testimony.

56
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,220
Who are the Wei spies?

57
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,909
One of them is Chen Gong,

58
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,909
General Li Yan's favorite pupil

59
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,230
and Chief Clerk of Siwencao Intelligence.

60
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,000
Chen Gong?

61
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,240
Right.

62
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,760
Chen Gong instigated Li Yan

63
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,970
to transfer the Three Battalions to besiege Nanzheng County

64
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,960
and fight against General Ma Dai.

65
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,300
He also colluded with Huang Yu and his remnants of Wuxian Sect

66
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,040
to build a dam in the upper reaches of the Mian River

67
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,140
and try to stop General Wei Yan from transporting the army provisions.

68
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:30,770
What's more,

69
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,740
he framed Feng Ying up

70
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,900
and assassinated Chief Xun Xu of the Internal Affairs Department.

71
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,790
He also asked the Wei spy Liu Ying

72
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,580
to set a honey-trap for Li Yan.

73
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,040
Liu Ying appeared

74
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,409
to be a singing girl of Ziyan House,

75
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,230
but turned out to be a spy instructed by Guo Huai.

76
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:48,550
Prime Minister,

77
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,940
all I have said is proved true.

78
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,320
Nothing is false.

79
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,820
I remember you told me

80
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,680
that Chen Gong was very loyal

81
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,010
and capable.

82
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,580
What about General Li Yan?

83
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,760
How did you deal with him?

84
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,630
When I got such evidence,

85
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,600
the situation was already urgent.

86
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,620
Immediately, General Ma Dai and I

87
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,460
had the gate of Nanzheng County closed

88
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,880
and Li Yan's camp besieged.

89
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,530
To our surprise,

90
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,240
Li Yan climbed down the city wall alone

91
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,419
and escaped.

92
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,860
He was heading for Jiangzhou on back roads

93
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,950
when Ma Dai caught him halfway.

94
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,410
Look, Prime Minister.

95
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:47,980
What's this?

96
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,780
It's a love poem Li Yan wrote to Liu Ying.

97
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,170
Very romantic.

98
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,780
Siwencao Intelligence is a national weapon.

99
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,580
It's supposed to be used against our enemies.

100
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,640
But you use spies

101
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,330
in politics.

102
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,940
Do you think this is appropriate?

103
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,470
Prime Minister,

104
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,980
Li Yan is always arrogant about his contributions

105
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,110
and only cares about his selfish interests.

106
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,340
He proposed many times to connect five counties

107
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,300
and establish Bazhou

108
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,310
so that he can be the Regional Inspector of Bazhou.

109
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,380
After you rejected his proposal,

110
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,220
he roped in clans in Xichuan and Linchuan and his former subordinates in Jingzhou

111
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,740
to start the argument on the Southern and Northern Expeditions.

112
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,060
He was exactly fighting you for power!

113
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,220
He even advised that you should be a lord.

114
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,490
Actually, he wanted to be a lord!

115
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,910
His ambition was abundantly clear!

116
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39,460
Prime Minister,

117
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,830
Li Yan is very treacherous.

118
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,210
Unless we get rid of him,

119
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,190
there will be great trouble in the court!

120
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,940
I wondered why Li Yan

121
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,240
dared to detain my army provisions as if he were out of his mind.

122
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,930
Now I understand.

123
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:41,590
But we should have the bottom line in power struggles!

124
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,860
And we should take a principled stand!

125
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,290
Think about it.

126
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,580
Think about it.

127
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,500
Think about

128
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,640
what on earth you have done.

129
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:11,530
Prime Minister.

130
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,550
Prime Minister!

131
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,230
I've done everything

132
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,900
to restore the Han Dynasty!

133
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:43,730
Within this month,

134
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,010
you're not allowed

135
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,860
to get involved in this case.

136
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:58,370
Chief Xun,

137
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,830
even if you keep waiting here,

138
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:04,170
you won't change anything.

139
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,130
Besides,

140
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:10,010
you haven't fully recovered yet.

141
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:03,070
Zhuge Liang, at last.

142
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,420
You thought I wouldn't come?

143
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,570
I did.

144
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,370
Zhuge Liang,

145
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,660
you're too ashamed to see me.

146
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,820
What makes you think so?

147
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,060
You asked Yang Yi to trap me

148
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,020
by using Siwencao Intelligence.

149
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,700
Such a treacherous trap

150
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,050
must be unmentionable.

151
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,310
I didn't know

152
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,300
that Yang Yi used Siwencao Intelligence.

153
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,180
That was

154
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:36,870
indeed inappropriate.

155
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:38,250
Inappropriate?

156
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,130
You think you can use this word

157
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:45,220
to explain to our people?

158
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,600
The trap was inappropriate,

159
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,630
but the result is correct.

160
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,220
What does this mean?

161
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,260
Do I deserve

162
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,340
to be framed up by your trap?

163
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,260
It was Yang Yi

164
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,150
who set the trap.

165
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,860
But if you didn't mean to rebel,

166
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:13,020
you wouldn't have colluded with the Wei Army,

167
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,100
cut off the army provisions for the Northern Expedition,

168
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,570
or faked the invasion of the Wu Army.

169
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,940
You ganged up secretly

170
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,020
and advocated the Southern Expedition,

171
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,050
trying to break our alliance with the Wu State.

172
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,980
You were hurting the foundation of our state.

173
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,180
Only by arresting you

174
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,700
can we avoid the ruin of our state.

175
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,540
This is about the survival of the state,

176
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,860
instead of personal grudges between us.

177
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,830
The Southern and Northern Expeditions are just different national policies.

178
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,890
When you insist on the Northern Expedition,

179
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,500
how can you guarantee that you can destroy the Wei State and make ours prosper?

180
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,840
In national policies,

181
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,400
there's no such thing as perfection.

182
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,020
But the alliance with Wu against the Wei State

183
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:13,100
will ensure the peace for at least 30 years.

184
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,400
If we break the alliance with the Wu State

185
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,040
and march east into Jingxiang Region,

186
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,570
the Wei Army will conquer the Hanzhong region.

187
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,290
With enemies from two directions,

188
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,990
in less than three years,

189
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,700
our state will perish.

190
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,340
By then,

191
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,020
Li Yan,

192
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,450
do you have the cheek to see the late emperor in heaven?

193
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,570
You worry about the explanation to our people.

194
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,900
But it's only about reputation.

195
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,980
You and I are supposed

196
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,750
to exhaust our energy for our state until we die.

197
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,230
Personal reputations

198
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,250
shouldn't be our concern.

199
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,730
Chief Xun.

200
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,780
Greetings, Chief Yang.

201
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,099
Don't bother to salute, Chief Xun.

202
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,490
I've been waiting here for more than a month.

203
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,160
But Feng Ying asked me to evade the case.

204
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:27,250
Xun Xu,

205
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,610
I came to tell you

206
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,380
that Chen Gong's case

207
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,250
will be closed.

208
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,460
How will he end up?

209
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,010
He will be beheaded

210
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:49,680
and his head will be abandoned in public.

211
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,040
I want to see him.

212
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,110
Let me see him.

213
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,540
Okay.

214
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,400
Thank you, Chief Yang.

215
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,480
Xun Xu,

216
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,040
there you are.

217
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:34,910
The verdict was announced.

218
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,360
Immediate decapitation.

219
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:42,810
Chief Yang will supervise it.

220
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,010
Fine.

221
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,570
A job for him.

222
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:50,390
He has to come again.

223
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,750
Why?

224
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:55,720
What are you asking about?

225
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,180
When you betrayed our state,

226
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,440
you were disloyal.

227
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,600
When you tried to kill me,

228
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,230
you were unjust.

229
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,500
Shortly after Di Yue was killed,

230
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,710
you colluded with the Wei Army.

231
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,020
You were heartless.

232
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,120
If my parents were still alive,

233
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,950
would you also accuse me

234
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,020
of being unfilial?

235
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,250
Indeed.

236
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,640
Your father Chen Fu

237
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:28,800
sacrificed his own life

238
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,070
to save General Li Yan.

239
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:34,060
The latter was also your teacher.

240
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,700
He treated you as his son,

241
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,790
but you trapped him

242
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,790
for the crime of treason.

243
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,600
It also made you

244
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:44,880
an unfilial man!

245
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,070
You're disloyal,

246
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,350
unjust,

247
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:50,870
heartless,

248
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,470
and unfilial.

249
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,470
Do you think I believe you're this kind of man?

250
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:01,700
You don't believe it?

251
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,400
I don't.

252
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,610
Tell me the reason.

253
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,620
You won't believe me even if I tell you.

254
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,680
Then why would I bother?

255
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,320
Try me.

256
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,350
All right, then.

257
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,230
I was ordered

258
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,370
to infiltrate the Wei State

259
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,990
and became the Guard Captain

260
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:32,970
of Commander Guo Huai.

261
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,660
When I was doing an important mission,

262
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,350
General Guo Huai caught me in the act.

263
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,570
Instead of punishing me,

264
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:45,110
he showed me a secret document.

265
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,200
As recorded in the document,

266
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,060
Feng Ying

267
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,410
sold my father out.

268
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:58,330
Then my father died in Zizhong Battle on behalf of Li Yan.

269
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:01,440
After you read this document,

270
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,860
you started to suspect me, right?

271
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,210
Guo Huai wanted to activate Qingping Plan.

272
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,420
I was the best candidate.

273
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,960
Just at that time, you went to Tianshui for Zhulong's case.

274
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,420
I kept the secret from you

275
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,280
and made use of you.

276
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,550
I managed to return to Nanzheng County

277
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,620
with very clear purposes.

278
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,780
I would kill Feng Ying,

279
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,360
and instigate Li Yan to rebel.

280
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,000
I wanted to kill everyone

281
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:27,980
who once hurt my father.

282
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:32,090
This is why and how I became Zhulong.

283
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,550
I don't believe it.

284
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,840
I know you don't believe it.

285
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,170
But this is true.

286
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:39,990
Chen Gong,

287
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,410
I will make a thorough investigation of this case.

288
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,380
The truth will be revealed sooner or later.

289
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,630
You know

290
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,060
what kind of man I am.

291
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:56,730
I also know

292
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,050
what kind of man you are!

293
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:09,490
Over the last month,

294
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,460
I've thought this case over

295
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,930
again and again.

296
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,350
Only one assumption may be possible.

297
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:22,640
Hear me out.

298
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,990
In the first Northern Expedition,

299
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,430
Jieting's false intelligence case occurred unexpectedly.

300
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,170
Guo Huai then activated Qingping Plan.

301
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,500
And you...

302
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,940
You hated Feng Ying

303
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,820
because of your father's death.

304
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:40,890
This is how

305
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,600
Guo Huai started to trust you.

306
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,680
He sent you to Wuxian Sect.

307
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:46,950
You appeared

308
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:50,120
to steal the design of crossbows.

309
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,960
But actually,

310
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,240
like you said,

311
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,350
you would sacrifice Wuxian Sect

312
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:01,080
and Gao Tangbing, the old Zhulong,

313
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:03,440
so that you could become a hero

314
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,350
and take Feng Ying's place!

315
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,130
Because

316
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,090
I cooperated with you,

317
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:18,490
Qingping Plan was successful.

318
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,610
Guo Huai had more confidence in you

319
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:21,480
and he was satisfied with you.

320
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,100
What he never expected was

321
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,530
that you pretended

322
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:29,280
to be carrying out the Plan step by step,

323
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,230
but in reality,

324
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,700
you were serving as a spy

325
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,450
for Yang Yi and Feng Ying.

326
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,500
Qingping Plan was

327
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,170
mere camouflage that you used

328
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,700
to complete your own plan!

329
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,360
Your real goal was

330
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,950
to trap General Li Yan

331
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,310
and overthrow him.

332
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,400
But then there was a problem.

333
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,470
Me, I mean.

334
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:01,670
Xun Xu,

335
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,610
don't flatter yourself.

336
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,470
Perhaps,

337
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,140
Guo Huai ordered you

338
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:22,810
to kill me personally

339
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,100
so that you would make your bones.

340
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,270
That's why

341
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,340
Huang Yu attacked the checkpoint at Xixiang.

342
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:33,590
He did that

343
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,990
just to lure me there

344
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,800
where you could kill me.

345
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,970
It wasn't a hard mission for you.

346
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,480
What made it hard was

347
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,070
that Yang Yi wanted to kill me, too.

348
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,780
My existence and my investigation on Zhulong

349
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,450
threatened the core of your plan!

350
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,690
If I kept investigating Zhulong's Case,

351
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,730
Li Yan's falling from power

352
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,420
would be questioned.

353
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,850
Even Prime Minister might be involved.

354
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:12,140
None of you could bear this!

355
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:12,980
Xun Xu,

356
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,170
what's the point

357
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:18,710
of making such a guess?

358
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:20,570
I'm indeed guessing.

359
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,150
But I'm guessing

360
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,380
based on my understanding of you.

361
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:37,430
I can see through you.

362
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,880
They both wanted me to die.

363
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:53,650
You wouldn't accept it.

364
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,980
But you had to go on with the plan.

365
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:00,470
So,

366
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,070
you asked Lin Liang to shoot me at the same time.

367
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:09,300
You locked me up after I was wounded.

368
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,360
I guess you had planned

369
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,090
to transfer me to somewhere safe

370
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,930
after the case was over.

371
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,910
In this way, you could complete your mission

372
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,960
and avoid killing me.

373
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,720
It could be a perfect plan.

374
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,700
But you never expected

375
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,350
that I ran away

376
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,510
even though I was wounded.

377
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,680
I came back

378
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,140
and ruined your plan.

379
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,110
At that time,

380
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,590
news that you were suspected as a Wei spy

381
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,330
filtered through the Agency.

382
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,600
You couldn't cover it up.

383
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:02,790
So, you had to change your plan!

384
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,620
Feng Ying

385
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,340
was supposed to die.

386
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,110
Because of me,

387
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:20,910
you had to sacrifice yourself.

388
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,820
Am I right?

389
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:34,140
Xun Xu,

390
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,330
spies like us

391
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:40,020
must keep some secrets even when we die.

392
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,600
I hurt my brother.

393
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:48,490
I failed to see my wife.

394
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,710
Such a life...

395
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,680
It sucks.

396
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,390
I'm right about it.

397
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:05,730
Chen Gong,

398
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,540
in this way,

399
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:14,860
I would be killing you!

400
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,570
Xun Xu!

401
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,110
Chen Gong!

402
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:23,310
Xun Xu, don't overthink.

403
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:25,340
I am...

404
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,830
I am Zhulong.

405
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:29,760
I betrayed our state.

406
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,500
I lost to you.

407
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:38,980
Xun Xu,

408
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,660
I beg you one thing.

409
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:46,910
Stop the investigation.

410
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:49,840
I beg you.

411
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,600
Stop the investigation.

412
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,420
I beg you to stop.

413
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:10,660
There's another solution.

414
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,220
Tell them that I'm a Wei spy.

415
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:19,810
Ten years ago,

416
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:22,650
because of my father's death,

417
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,600
I was instigated by Guo Huai

418
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,100
and I became Zhulong.

419
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,790
Then tell the truth about what happened later.

420
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,480
You can also say

421
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,860
that I instigated Li Yan to rebel.

422
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,330
Clerk Feng...

423
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,350
No matter what Clerk Feng did,

424
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:42,000
pretend

425
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,550
that I did it.

426
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,020
In this way, Clerk Feng

427
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,690
could also get out of trouble.

428
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,040
He can be reinstated, then.

429
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,480
Think about it.

430
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,750
The whole case

431
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,500
will be perfect.

432
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:01,090
No one else will be involved.

433
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,480
I don't agree!

434
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,300
Without you,

435
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,400
our plan to infiltrate the senior management of Wei

436
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,500
will completely fail.

437
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,540
This is the only option we have.

438
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,030
Accusing me of being a Wei spy

439
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,780
can keep everyone else out of trouble.

440
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,240
And everything

441
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:30,660
can be clearly explained.

442
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,750
Stop the investigation.

443
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,280
Stop it.

444
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,260
Let it be.

445
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,870
I was vindicated.

446
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:07,580
Chen Gong framed me up.

447
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:09,590
Prime Minister asked me

448
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,430
to take control of Siwencao Intelligence again.

449
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,590
You have a new job.

450
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:19,180
The Prime Minister

451
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,470
ordered you to go to the Wu State as an envoy.

452
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,110
You shall go to Jianye

453
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:26,480
and build a new intelligence network there.

454
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,170
Time for execution!

455
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,489
I have only one request.

456
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,300
You must do it.

457
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:29,060
Make a tombstone for Chen Gong

458
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,989
and bury him with Di Yue.

459
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,110
Feng Ying.

460
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:44,600
(Xun Xu, Chen Gong)

461
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:25,320
(Tomb of Di Yue)
(Tomb of Chen Gong)

462
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:45,300
Chief Xun,

463
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,570
the carriage to the Wu State has arrived.

464
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:50,020
Chief Yang came personally to pick you up.

465
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,480
It's quite windy out there.

466
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,160
Get in for some rest.

467
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,460
It doesn't matter.

468
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:15,980
Chen Gong asked me to tell you something.

469
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,640
I'm all ears.

470
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,630
He asked me to tell you about it

471
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,910
if you still couldn't let it go

472
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:29,370
after a month.

473
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,600
He arranged your prison break

474
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:36,250
from the cellar.

475
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:45,210
He asked me

476
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:48,150
to leave the bowl to you

477
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:49,570
and drop the flint from my pocket.

478
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:54,390
He knew

479
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:57,690
about the secret passage in the cellar.

480
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:00,030
He also knew

481
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,060
that you would find it.

482
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,230
Oh, I understand.

483
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,190
Di Yue died

484
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,250
and he kept condemning himself.

485
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,120
From then on,

486
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,990
he was determined to die.

487
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,320
He asked me to pass the message

488
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:38,430
that you should let go of this thing.

489
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,500
You didn't kill him.

490
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:48,720
Actually,

491
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:52,110
Chen Gong was tired of such a life a long time ago.

492
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:56,350
He had planned to live in seclusion with Di Yue

493
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:59,460
after capturing Zhulong.

494
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,670
From the day Di Yue died,

495
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:05,580
Chen Gong

496
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,670
changed his plan, right?

497
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,470
Right.

498
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,860
Since then,

499
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:18,180
he had taken action based on his own thoughts.

500
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,550
You know

501
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,410
what happened later.

502
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:29,760
I get it.

503
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:04,500
Go get prepared.

504
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:05,710
We will disembark.

505
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:07,650
Okay.

506
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:09,860
During our mission in the Wu State,

507
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:11,800
you're not an attendant,

508
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,150
but an official.

509
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:14,860
Court Gentleman of Ceremonial Minister.

510
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,410
Don't have any omissions on etiquette.

511
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:19,640
Aye, sir.

512
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:21,450
Everything is ready.

Today,

516
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:27,810
we have the last strategy.

517
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:29,070
It turns out

518
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:30,720
that Chen Gong had to be convicted

519
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,300
so that the Wei Army

520
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,300
would not suspect Shu's trap

521
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,190
against their Qingping Plan.

522
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:38,540
When Xun Xu came to arrest Chen Gong unexpectedly,

523
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,090
Chen Gong and Yang Yi were at a loss about what to do.

524
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:41,830
They had no choice,

525
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:43,490
but to sacrifice Chen Gong.

526
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,280
Take him away!

527
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,300
Instead of Feng Ying,

528
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:47,730
Chen Gong became the biggest scapegoat.

529
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,450
When Yang Yi took the chance

530
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:50,750
to explain to Prime Minister Zhuge

531
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:52,970
how Chen Gong betrayed the state,

532
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:55,440
he showed strong resentment

533
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:56,750
towards Li Yan.

534
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:58,620
Prime Minister Zhuge was infuriated.

535
00:43:58,650 --> 00:43:59,770
Yang Yi,

536
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:01,820
you should listen to Prime Minister.

537
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,280
You should have the bottom line in power struggles.

538
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:04,970
And you should take a principled stand.

539
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,480
Think it over.

540
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:07,910
On the other hand,

541
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:10,140
Chen Gong saved Xun Xu's life

542
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:12,830
and knew Xun Xu would track him down.

543
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:15,620
Having expected this day,

544
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,710
Chen Gong took the blame.

545
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,280
He was caught

546
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:22,610
so that the condition of his state would be stable.

547
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,840
He sacrificed himself

548
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:27,650
for the bright future of restoring the Han Dynasty.

549
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,680
In front of Chen Gong and Di Yue's tomb,

550
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:31,780
Xun Xu poured off the wine for them

551
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,800
and bid farewell.

552
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:33,910
In the end,

553
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,180
the great mission

554
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:36,390
and the complicated strategy

555
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:37,810
are brought to a temporary close.

556
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:39,760
Chen Gong died, but he isn't gone.

557
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:41,760
Xun Xu took over his mission.

558
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,570
The next journey will be in the Wu State.

559
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:45,560
My exclusive intelligence report

560
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,390
will hereby come to an end.
