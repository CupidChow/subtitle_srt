00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,920
(The Tenth Strategy If All Else Fails, Retreat)

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,670
Xun Xu, what were you thinking

4
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,180
by getting Clerk Feng out?

5
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,759
I knew he was framed.

6
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,170
Ma Sheng's will isn't solid proof.

7
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,140
If they task me

8
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,520
with this case,

9
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,330
I'm telling you,

10
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,580
the truth will come out in ten days!

11
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,289
It's not as simple as you think.

12
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,410
Things in Chengdu are changing.

13
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,670
Look,

14
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,100
the more there is to this case,

15
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,840
the less likely you're to be on it.

16
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,530
Don't you know that?

17
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:03,750
Tangbing,

18
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,750
Clerk Feng treated you well, didn't he?

19
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,450
You can't sit and do nothing

20
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,400
while he's going down.

21
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:10,250
-I didn't mean...
-Say no more.

22
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,290
It is what it is. Are you in or not?

23
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,540
You...

24
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,510
Fine.

25
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,790
What do you need me to do?

26
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,060
Get Clerk Feng

27
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,079
out of town tonight

28
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,100
and tread carefully.

29
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,460
Tonight?

30
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,070
Yes. That's right.

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,450
Aren't you aware

32
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,190
that Clerk Li has asked General Ma Dai

33
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:53,250
to impose a lockdown to seize the escaped?

34
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,850
Not even a bird can sneak out.

35
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,910
No excuses.

36
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,520
You're in charge of Intelligence Analysis.

37
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,500
There must be something you can do.

38
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,690
Can we trust Chief Gao?

39
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,450
Absolutely.

40
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,700
Tangbing and I go way back.

41
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,280
He knows what to do for the best.

42
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,180
I had him

43
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:35,540
go over to

44
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,860
sound Xun Xu out.

45
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:44,220
Actually,

46
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,060
there's a way out.

47
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,120
I'm listening.

48
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,310
General Ma Dai and the Madam of Ziyan House

49
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,270
are old friends.

50
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,920
He'd have her girls over

51
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,440
to entertain his men at the Yangping Pass

52
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,790
on the last night of every month.

53
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,180
And tonight is the night.

54
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,600
He's guarding Hanzhong

55
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,460
and the garrison in Nanzheng is

56
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,100
under his command.

57
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,100
How's this plan?

58
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:09,930
It's clever!

59
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:10,950
Terrific!

60
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,780
I know I can count on you, Chief Gao.

61
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:15,690
But,

62
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,010
to make it work,

63
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:18,610
I still need your help.

64
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,060
But how? I'm being watched day and night.

65
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,560
Hadn't Yin Ji sent you to sound me out,

66
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,690
I couldn't have gone to your place.

67
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,820
There's no legwork involved.

68
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,120
I just need you to send a message.

69
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,980
Where to?

70
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,490
Ziyan House.

71
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,680
I've never been to that kind of place.

72
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:36,870
Come on, liar!

73
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,050
You can't fool me.

74
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,260
That girl you found in Wudu has risen to

75
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,570
the top harlot there.

76
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,830
Don't forget what my department does.

77
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,260
What you did is logged in the system.

78
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,350
Don't you have

79
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,670
anything better to do?

80
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,590
Without such information,

81
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:51,970
I wouldn't be of help now.

82
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,440
Show this to Miss Liu

83
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:21,610
and she'll help you.

84
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,700
Is this a token of love?

85
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,120
Knock it off!

86
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,300
The Shu Army's garrison

87
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,340
has set up three lines of defense here.

88
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,250
There's only one path in and out of the col.

89
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,820
I wish we had the passwords and the tallies

90
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,350
to each post.

91
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,110
The guards and the tallies

92
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,030
are assigned randomly.

93
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,900
Even if we got them, they could be wrong.

94
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,100
Is there anything

95
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,710
Zhulong can do about it?

96
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,070
He's done everything he could

97
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,950
by giving us the map and the key.

98
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:20,950
Speaking of which,

99
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,960
this key is to the stone vault

100
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,150
keeping the design of the crossbow.

101
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,050
That gives us a better chance of success.

102
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,600
You'll have to jump off the cliff here.

103
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:34,610
I understand.

104
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,300
We've covered the entrance and the exit.

105
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,850
Now, let's go over the plan

106
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,630
once we get into the head office.

107
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,090
Have you rehearsed it?

108
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,680
Yes, many times.

109
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,080
Look,

110
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,560
Mister Mi.

111
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,080
The front gate leads to

112
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,470
five layers of courtyards.

113
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:54,620
The scribe room is

114
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,120
in the last one

115
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,930
with a secret chamber.

116
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,670
That's where the design is.

117
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,580
Is the scribe room guarded?

118
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:03,740
Yes.

119
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,010
As the main force is

120
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,410
lined up for defense,

121
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,760
guards outside the scribe room are only a few,

122
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,020
less than ten, I presume.

123
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:15,830
In that case,

124
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,470
we'll need a crack team.

125
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:20,080
Once you finish, leave through the back door.

126
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,800
The backyard is an open field

127
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,120
mostly used by the Shu Army for training.

128
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,700
And the cliff is right behind it

129
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,860
and left unguarded,

130
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,900
known as a natural barrier.

131
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:32,670
Leader...

132
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,960
Even if we have the crack team in there,

133
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,640
only two will be able to

134
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,510
make their way out alive.

135
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,980
Members of our sect aren't afraid of death.

136
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,159
Qingping Plan

137
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:45,850
concerns the future of our state.

138
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,130
Its success will come at a cost.

139
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,020
You two,

140
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,580
take the Bamboo Kites

141
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,850
and leave

142
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,020
with the design.

143
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,260
The thing is,

144
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,700
once we enter,

145
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,820
Shu soldiers

146
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,430
in the Military Technology Department

147
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,620
will be alerted.

148
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,580
We can get in and out quickly

149
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:07,640
with the design,

150
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,980
but once they find

151
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,880
that the design is missing,

152
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:13,030
the entire mountain will be sealed off.

153
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,080
And we won't be able to break out

154
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,350
with the design

155
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,030
even if we land safely.

156
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,350
That will be

157
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,830
Zhulong's concern.

158
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,360
All you two need to do is

159
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,340
grab the design from the head office

160
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,460
and put it at the drop spot.

161
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,929
Zhulong will pick it up

162
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:35,700
from Mount Dingjun

163
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,490
and send it to Tianshui.

164
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,900
Where's the drop spot?

165
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,630
I don't know

166
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,660
because he hasn't told me.

167
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,230
The last question is

168
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:52,780
if the Bamboo Kites

169
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,670
can fly Mister Mi and me

170
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,330
to that spot safely.

171
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,710
What if we're in the air and...?

172
00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:59,210
Don't think too much.

173
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,690
The Bamboo Kites are our only option.

174
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,170
I'll fly with you.

175
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,260
You'll sacrifice yourselves for the great cause

176
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,550
and so will I.

177
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,620
Trust me.

178
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,750
You're a warrior.

179
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,990
If all goes well,

180
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,430
Qingping Plan will be a success.

181
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,240
Leader,

182
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,590
when shall we act?

183
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,450
In five days.

184
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:22,610
On Zhulong's signal.

185
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,480
Sure.

186
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:31,130
(Tianshui, the Wei State)

187
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,560
Liang Jian

188
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:47,840
pays his respects to you, Governor.

189
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,680
(Liang Jian with Intelligence Agency in Tianshui of Wei)
pays his respects to you, Governor.

190
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,570
(Liang Jian with Intelligence Agency in Tianshui of Wei)

191
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,900
Liang Jian,

192
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:54,650
two updates for you.

193
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:57,620
One, Chancellor Mi

194
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,570
has arrived at Hanzhong

195
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,370
to gather together the Wuxian Sect.

196
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,530
He won't be back soon.

197
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,750
While he's away,

198
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,710
you'll be in charge of

199
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,330
the Intelligence Agency.

200
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:08,600
Yes, sir.

201
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,050
Oh, I almost forgot.

202
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:15,820
Uh,

203
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:20,460
Recorder Chen died

204
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,230
at the Yangping Pass.

205
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,420
He was

206
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,230
a hero.

207
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:30,900
What a shame!

208
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,270
One of a kind?

209
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,060
He was Baidi.

210
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,160
Yes, Chen Gong was a spy.

211
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,190
Chancellor Mi was right.

212
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:00,390
I was wrong.

213
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,190
Wrong and stupid.

214
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,500
Siwencao Intelligence of Shu

215
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,230
has declassified records about him

216
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,170
and it's corroborated by other sources.

217
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,150
Still, that doesn't affect the Qingping Plan.

218
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,140
It'll go on as planned.

219
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,050
Liang Jian,

220
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,760
work hard.

221
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,660
It's too big

222
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:30,630
a responsibility.

223
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:34,300
I'll do my utmost.

224
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,620
There's one more thing,

225
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,340
that is,

226
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:47,990
someone will replace me.

227
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:50,910
I'm leaving.

228
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,740
Where are you going, sir?

229
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,760
Commander Guo

230
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,910
has another plan for me.

231
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,030
I'll be escorted back to Chang'an

232
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,690
and deprived of my ranks.

233
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:19,750
So long.

234
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:21,810
-It's raining.
-Don't worry about it.

235
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,040
Come and join us!

236
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:00,700
Here?

237
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,380
Yes.

238
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:03,690
Miss Liu,

239
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:05,680
good day.

240
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:22,610
She's out.

241
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,090
The gate is right ahead.

242
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:49,840
Stop.

243
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,720
You're going out again, Zhang?

244
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,110
I'm taking General Ma Dai's friend

245
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,430
to the Yangping Pass.

246
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,840
You know it's a routine

247
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,180
once a month.

248
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,390
Please, Officer.

249
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,070
I heard General Wei Yan will be there, too.

250
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:07,580
Fine.

251
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,630
Let him out.

252
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,220
-Thank you, Officer.
-Wait.

253
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:14,710
Chief Yin.

254
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,510
inside is a guest of General Ma Dai's.

255
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,180
Whoever gets out of town

256
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,660
must be checked thoroughly.

257
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,520
Of course.

258
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:31,450
Greetings,

259
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,730
Chief Yin.

260
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,210
Miss Liu!

261
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,940
General Ma Dai

262
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:45,890
appointed her by name.

263
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,080
You aren't going to frisk her, are you?

264
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,430
Don't forget to check other carriages

265
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:03,500
for smuggling.

266
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,470
Yes, sir.

267
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:06,490
Let them go.

268
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:07,800
Thank you, Officer.

269
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,180
Let's go.

270
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,310
Let's go.

271
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,340
He let Feng Ying go?

272
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,610
(General Li Yan's Mansion in Chengdu, the Shu State)
He let Feng Ying go?

273
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:25,140
(General Li Yan's Mansion in Chengdu, the Shu State)

274
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,140
Could Li Miao be more impotent?
(General Li Yan's Mansion in Chengdu, the Shu State)

275
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,310
Nanzheng is in lockdown.

276
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,470
The Agency, garrison in Hanzhong

277
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,070
and local forces of Nanzheng are all out.

278
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,310
Feng Ying won't be able to get out of their hands.

279
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,380
He won't?

280
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,410
He already has.

281
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,320
Luckily, I thought ahead

282
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,550
and didn't report his idea to His Majesty,

283
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,140
or we'd be in trouble

284
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,400
if the case got overturned.

285
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:54,940
You're wise, General.

286
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,780
What did His Majesty say

287
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,830
in court this morning?

288
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,450
Nothing new.

289
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:05,849
He's unpredictable.

290
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:08,920
The court will end tomorrow.

291
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,560
Whether we battle the north or the south

292
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:11,900
shall be decided then.

293
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:16,920
Zhuge Liang's supporters are many.

294
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,750
It's a tug of war.

295
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,099
Both sides

296
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,839
have a chance to win.

297
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,220
Will the impeachment fail yet again?

298
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:28,970
It's hard to tell.

299
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,740
General,

300
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,220
Feng Ying from Hanzhong is outside.

301
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,150
Who is it?

302
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,660
Clerk Feng of the Agency, Feng Ying.

303
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,260
Feng Ying is

304
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,410
smarter than I imagined.

305
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,550
Send him in.

306
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:48,480
But...

307
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,990
I'll have a go at him.

308
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,500
Yes, sir.

309
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,090
Feng Ying

310
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,520
pays his respects to you, Cavalry General.

311
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,560
Why

312
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,180
would a wanted criminal

313
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,190
ask to see me?

314
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,940
You should turn yourself in

315
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,540
at the Law Enforcement Office.

316
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,800
The missing of Baidi's code-cracking plates

317
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,820
and the murder of Liao Hui of Internal Affairs

318
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,450
were pinned on me by Li Miao.

319
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,530
Please bring justice to me, sir.

320
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:46,990
Oh?

321
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:51,310
Injustice is everywhere.

322
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,380
Why should I believe you?

323
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,470
I've got proof.

324
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,060
Proof?

325
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,450
Please read this.

326
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,080
Unbelievable!

327
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,260
Ridiculous!

328
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,420
Ma Sheng's statement and the case corroborate each other.

329
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,530
It's not fabricated.

330
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,490
Is there any hard evidence?

331
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,260
Li Miao is too noble

332
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,340
to go this low

333
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,620
and set up his colleague.

334
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,020
Turn this evidence over

335
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,970
to the Law Enforcement Office,

336
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,150
they'll get to the bottom of the case

337
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,950
and clear my name.

338
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,960
You're Yang Yi's underling.

339
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:22,280
Why not give this to him

340
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:24,650
and it's win-win?

341
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:26,710
I, Feng Ying,

342
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,220
am a decent court official,

343
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,160
not anyone's underling.

344
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,900
I risked my life to come here

345
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:39,450
to have a sincere talk with you, General.

346
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:41,710
Let's hear it.

347
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:47,950
With this piece of evidence,

348
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,350
I'll no longer be killed

349
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,680
but this whole incident

350
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,340
can go either way.

351
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:57,630
Is that so?

352
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,490
General,

353
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,800
you seized the chance of Prime Minister's loss of Jieting

354
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,650
and gained support

355
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,110
to halt the Northern Expedition

356
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:09,310
and clean the house.

357
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,210
Then you took over the Agency

358
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,630
to nip further threats in the bud.

359
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,460
That's remarkable!

360
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,950
But if Yang Yi

361
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,140
got hold of this evidence,

362
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,100
all your effort

363
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,750
would be in vain.

364
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,700
Keep going.

365
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,510
Yang Yi is

366
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,980
narrow-minded,

367
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:39,820
domineering

368
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,710
and a beast.

369
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,060
We're still battling poverty at home,

370
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,810
and the Northern Expedition

371
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,480
will cost us our future.

372
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,660
So?

373
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,280
I hate to see

374
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,120
your years of preparation

375
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,430
go up in flames.

376
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,880
(Xun Xu's Residence in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

377
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,890
Chief Xun,

378
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,310
Clerk Feng should be

379
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,460
in Chengdu by now, right?

380
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,880
The curfew hasn't been lifted.

381
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,350
All is going well, I guess.

382
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,530
We should thank Chief Gao for it.

383
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,460
Without him,

384
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,740
it wouldn't be possible.

385
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:34,370
Sir,

386
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,690
how did you know

387
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,010
he'd agree to help?

388
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,280
Well,

389
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,590
what kind of person

390
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,760
do you think he is?

391
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,030
He's cautious,

392
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:52,870
logical

393
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:54,540
and a visionary.

394
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,010
Pei Xu,

395
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,390
you should work on your people skills.

396
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:01,750
Please

397
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,500
enlighten me.

398
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,910
He's cautious

399
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,060
about committing himself to anything.

400
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,330
You're right about that.

401
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,970
But by nature,

402
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,940
he only sides with the winner

403
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,910
in any circumstance.

404
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,510
Ma Sheng's last words

405
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,140
have guaranteed us victory.

406
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,540
The truth or the evidence

407
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,280
no longer matters.

408
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,790
It's only a matter of time

409
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,590
before Li Miao's downfall.

410
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,180
He held a grudge

411
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,310
against Yang Yi

412
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,080
and to get back at him,

413
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:50,350
he threatened Ma Sheng to slaughter Liao Hui.

414
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,270
That was a heinous crime!

415
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,110
Poor Liao Hui

416
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,100
always regarded us as brothers.

417
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,430
He died a martyr

418
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:10,950
for our state.

419
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,540
But the investigation on Zhulong

420
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,660
seems to have gone nowhere.

421
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,540
I have a feeling

422
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,430
that he's behind everything.

423
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,640
I'm swearing allegiance

424
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,330
to you.

425
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,540
Well then,

426
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,340
Clerk Feng,

427
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:48,530
I'll accept

428
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:50,770
your gift.

429
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,390
It's my pleasure to serve you.

430
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,580
There's one thing bothering me.

431
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,900
When I first landed in Nanzheng

432
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,720
and invited you over and over,

433
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,100
why did you

434
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,820
refuse to come?

435
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,300
Sir,

436
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,100
a fine fowl

437
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,860
perches only on a fine tree.

438
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,510
Only when you were in desperate need of help

439
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,620
would my talent be most appreciated.

440
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,550
What makes you think

441
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,790
that I need you

442
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,350
right now?

443
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,630
You and Prime Minister

444
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,810
have entirely different plans for the state.

445
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,900
Everyone knows it.

446
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:36,410
This time,

447
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,500
his loss on the battlefield

448
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:42,180
provided you with a golden opportunity to bring him down.

449
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,680
However,

450
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,760
he was too deeply rooted

451
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,770
and well-connected in court

452
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:52,430
to fall easily.

453
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,190
Then you had Li Miao

454
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,700
control the Agency.

455
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,070
As much as he tried

456
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,780
to win their members over,

457
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,750
he failed

458
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:02,850
to find his way in,

459
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,060
which left him no choice

460
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,490
but to cook up this clumsy trick

461
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:08,480
to set up an innocent man.

462
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:12,920
Sir,

463
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,010
I apologize

464
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,360
if my poppycock

465
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,020
offended you in any way.

466
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,570
Keep going.

467
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,380
You've had

468
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,670
the Noble Clans at your back

469
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,660
to gang up on Prime Minister.

470
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,030
It's too late to quit

471
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,530
and

472
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,470
it's life and death.

473
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,960
And?

474
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,550
If...

475
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,700
I mean, if I have

476
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,790
solid evidence that Yang Yi is colluding with

477
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,050
those bandits of the Wuxian Sect,

478
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,800
I suppose that'll be of great help to you,

479
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,350
General.

480
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:06,200
Clerk Feng,

481
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:07,770
please be seated.

482
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,780
Thank you, sir.

483
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:33,230
Our state

484
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,080
needs pillars like you,

485
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:37,980
loyal and dedicated.

486
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,140
I'm honored

487
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,430
and ready to serve.

488
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,660
(Wuxian Sect, Border of the Shu State)

489
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,260
Have some.
(Wuxian Sect, Border of the Shu State)

490
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,180
I can still drink.
(Wuxian Sect, Border of the Shu State)

491
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:01,200
(Wuxian Sect, Border of the Shu State)

492
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,240
Me too.
(Wuxian Sect, Border of the Shu State)

493
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:02,520
(Wuxian Sect, Border of the Shu State)

494
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:02,700
You... you don't respect me at all!
(Wuxian Sect, Border of the Shu State)

495
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,920
You... you don't respect me at all!

496
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,220
Am I right?

497
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,600
You know me.

498
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:09,990
I wouldn't dare!

499
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,170
I can drink more!

500
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,160
I...

501
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:13,750
believe you.

502
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:15,300
Let's go back and...

503
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,050
-Mister Mi.
-Keep drinking.

504
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:18,250
Elder Qin.

505
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:20,790
My lady.

506
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:21,580
My lady.

507
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,460
Mister Mi,

508
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,080
let me walk you back with my lamp.

509
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,790
No need. I'll do it. We...

510
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,460
Elder Qin,

511
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,260
you look befuddled.

512
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,690
Go back and rest.

513
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:33,740
Yes.

514
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,960
I apologize.

515
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,740
Thank you, my lady.

516
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:40,970
Thank you, my lady.

517
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,340
Mister Mi,

518
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:51,980
you've had too much to drink, too.

519
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,540
I'll escort you back.

520
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,110
Do you and Xun Xu have a way to contact each other?

521
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:08,900
Yes.

522
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,550
The next time will be soon.

523
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:12,570
The day is coming.

524
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:13,900
We need his help

525
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,470
to capture Zhulong.

526
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,030
Sure.

527
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:16,870
I understand.

528
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,640
I'll fill him in on each step.

529
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,300
My concern is

530
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,330
Huang Yu's men

531
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,690
will be with you out there.

532
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,400
Will that be a problem?

533
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,910
Relax. I know what to do.

534
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,290
Mister Mi,

535
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,440
this is it.

536
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,860
I have something for you.

537
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,790
What is it?

538
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:39,100
I found this when Huang Yu tried to burn it.

539
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,720
Only half is left.

540
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:42,050
It was from Zhulong

541
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,280
with some numbers

542
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:45,420
that make no sense to me.

543
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:49,940
Uh... Thank you, my lady.

544
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,230
Mister Mi,

545
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,980
good night.

546
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,300
Good night, my lady.

547
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:21,510
(Prime Minister Zhuge's Mansion in Chengdu, the Shu State)

548
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,100
Prime Minister,

549
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,500
you're back from the court early.

550
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,630
Because the result is out.

551
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:48,170
So... did Li Yan withdraw his impeachment?

552
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:06,690
(Cavalry General Li Yan)

553
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:18,670
(Li Yan's Camp in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

554
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:20,400
General,

555
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:21,570
Clerk Li with the Agency

556
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,080
has been waiting for you at the camp.

557
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:39,990
Is General-in-Chief back?

558
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,260
He's getting changed.

559
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,960
Please wait for a few more minutes.

560
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,170
Li Miao.

561
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:57,910
Hu Zhong.

562
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:58,730
Li Miao.

563
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,310
Can I go and see him?

564
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:03,230
He's resting after his trip.

565
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:04,990
Hu Zhong,

566
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,370
help me, please!

567
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:09,870
I'm begging you!

568
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,920
What happened?

569
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:14,660
Feng Ying escaped and he's still on the run.

570
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:17,470
I'm afraid he's gone to Yang Yi in Chengdu!

571
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:19,280
I ruined General's plan!

572
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,510
It was all my fault...

573
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,220
Li Miao,

574
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,550
you're worrying too much.

575
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,250
Li Yan has submitted new evidence.

576
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:30,090
Against Feng Ying?

577
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,640
Li Miao is a lunatic.

578
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,270
Those charges he trumped up

579
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:37,010
are a joke!

580
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,320
They're full of loopholes!

581
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,210
Li Yan said

582
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,350
when you were head of the Agency,

583
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,700
the Wuxian Sect grew strong and insubordinate

584
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,800
under your watch.

585
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:49,370
What?

586
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,480
Files Feng Ying turned over to Li Yan

587
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,140
include a surveillance record

588
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,890
from November 26th

589
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:00,520
that you reviewed.

590
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,060
The record showed a man and a woman

591
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,580
with the Wuxian Sect

592
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:09,230
paid a visit to General Wang Ping.

593
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,740
Their conversation was unknown.

594
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,120
“Noted.

595
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:13,510
Report not.”

596
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,820
You wrote that

597
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:18,630
and the Agency followed your instruction

598
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,240
to not report it to the upper level

599
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,390
and filed it away.

600
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:31,980
Why?

601
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,500
General Wang Ping is

602
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,520
your right-hand man.

603
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,160
Such information could be used against you

604
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:45,790
if leaked out.

605
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,580
Li Yan didn't think so.

606
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,810
He believed

607
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,590
you were covering for the Army's secret contact

608
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,130
with the Wuxian Sect

609
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,680
and backed them under the table

610
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,570
so that it's gaining strength.

611
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,140
Intelligence Agency of the Wei

612
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,560
is in league with them, too.

613
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,380
You're

614
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,219
the cause of everything.

615
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,400
Prime Minister!

616
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,020
Feng Ying must've betrayed us,

617
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,560
or Li Yan couldn't have gotten hold of

618
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:15,060
such classified records!

619
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,989
His Majesty has ordered

620
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:23,909
an all-out strike on the Wuxian Sect.

621
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,340
As for you,

622
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:29,989
you're dismissed and demoted to a civilian.

623
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:33,540
Prime Minister!

624
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,000
You have your own merits

625
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,010
but you lack

626
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:40,030
a big heart

627
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:41,969
and patience.

628
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:47,770
Read more books at home.

629
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:50,909
You'll benefit from them.

630
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,260
Yang Yi has been dismissed?

631
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:28,250
That's like cutting off Zhuge Liang's arm!

632
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,630
Yang Yi has left office

633
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,140
and you've got your revenge.

634
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:36,390
An eye for an eye isn't enough.

635
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,420
I want more.

636
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:42,390
General speaks highly of you

637
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:43,820
for the good work

638
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,350
you've done.

639
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,380
That's nothing.

640
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:50,170
I'm just glad that I didn't hold him back.

641
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,630
The impeachment worked

642
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,310
not because of the failed Northern Expedition

643
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,890
or the Wei spy in the Agency.

644
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,360
On what ground then?

645
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,100
Yang Yi sponsored the Wuxian Sect secretly,

646
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,290
posing a threat to the state,

647
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:06,280
and kept expanding the Agency's influence.

648
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,460
And the evidence from General was strong?

649
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,050
Of course.

650
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,620
His Majesty ordered an elimination in rage.

651
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,960
And Feng Ying's case...

652
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:21,070
Don't worry

653
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,020
about that clown.

654
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,790
General had been aware of

655
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,420
the ins and outs of the case.

656
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,040
When His Majesty asked about it in court,

657
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,420
General

658
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,150
covered for you

659
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,630
and he specifically told me

660
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,300
to calm you down.

661
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,130
Li Miao,

662
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,900
he still needs you

663
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,520
to battle the Wuxian Sect.

664
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,410
His wish is my command.

665
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:57,330
I, Li Miao,

666
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:58,970
could never repay you

667
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,650
for your kindness,

668
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,350
General!

669
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:33,290
(Ziyan House in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

670
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:34,530
With Yang Yi gone,
(Ziyan House in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

671
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:37,070
Prime Minister is under less pressure.

672
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,660
I want to help him

673
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:44,230
even for old times' sake.

674
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,930
You did what was best for everyone

675
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,770
even when stuck between two sides.

676
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,180
No one else in the region

677
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,420
could do what you did.

678
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,300
Stop flattering me.

679
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,610
I'm forced

680
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,660
to turn to Li Yan.

681
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:13,580
And

682
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,370
what's General Li

683
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,100
going to do with Clerk Li?

684
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,140
When Prime Minister let him go,

685
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,350
General Li took him in

686
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,900
and planted him into the Agency.

687
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,020
Were he found guilty,

688
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,460
General Li

689
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,090
would look bad, too, wouldn't he?

690
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:33,840
So a high-profile case

691
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:35,230
just goes away

692
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,420
like this?

693
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:38,370
That's absurd!

694
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,360
He's to wipe out the Wuxian Sect, isn't he?

695
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,270
He'll be remembered

696
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:48,930
for our victory.

697
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:00,490
Is that the plan?

698
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,200
I must say General Li is...

699
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:11,670
heartless.

700
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:12,630
Heartless?

701
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,840
The powerful

702
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,800
have no hearts.

703
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,830
I've recommended you to him

704
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:25,210
that you're the right one

705
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,380
for this job.

706
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:29,480
Me?

707
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:31,290
I'll be straight with you.

708
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,570
No one

709
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:34,880
can always

710
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,040
have a foot in both camps.

711
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:42,870
Get the job done

712
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:45,880
and Li Miao's mansion is yours.

713
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:49,430
You deserve it

714
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,020
with your seniority.

715
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:10,380
Generals.

716
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:23,850
Would you like a song

717
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:24,830
for entertainment?

718
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,660
Clerk Feng and I are here for business.

719
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,410
Maybe next time.

720
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,590
Have a nice day, gentlemen.

721
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,610
She saved my life last time, didn't she?

722
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,690
Yes, that was Miss Liu.

723
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:56,810
It's rare

724
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,460
to see someone

725
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,540
with her righteousness and courage.

726
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:06,410
Agreed.

727
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,880
Without her,

728
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,110
you would've been

729
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,700
in a tougher situation.

730
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:17,900
I'll give her a chance

731
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,340
to climb up the ladder

732
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:24,130
and show her that she'll be rewarded

733
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:26,040
for her good deeds.

734
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:33,200
Despite what she did for you,

735
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,870
she's nothing

736
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:36,610
but a street performer.

737
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,010
Why are you

738
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,370
so interested in her?

739
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,650
You know,

740
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:44,710
General Li has an elegant taste.

741
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,950
He's into music

742
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:49,490
and a professional himself.

743
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:52,880
If so,

744
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,020
this can be a smart move.

745
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:57,750
By the way,

746
00:41:57,970 --> 00:41:58,970
what about Sun Ling?

747
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,500
He's tough.

748
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,660
He's been keeping his mouth shut for you

749
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:04,990
no matter how hard he's grilled.

750
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,990
Sun Ling

751
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,340
is impetuous.

752
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,730
Pain will help him grow.

753
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,850
He'll be fine

754
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,710
once my job is done.

755
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:24,700
Look,

756
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,890
Xun Xu isn't good with secrets.

757
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,640
Do not tell him the truth.

758
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:31,920
I won't.

759
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,220
If he asks,

760
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:41,960
tell him my whereabouts are still unknown.

761
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:58,350
Clerk Feng has left.

762
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:00,780
Would you like to have a seat inside, Chief Gao?

763
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:02,640
Sure.

764
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,110
(The 24 Strategies of War, The Wind Blows from Longxi)
(Intelligence Agency in Longxi)

765
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:16,260
(The Tenth Strategy If All Else Fails, Retreat)

766
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:20,750
Well done!

767
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:23,270
Thanks to Xun Xu,

768
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,940
Feng Ying made his way out

769
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,200
with Miss Liu Ying's help.

770
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,290
I knew

771
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:31,780
he could do it!

772
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,610
I'll also make my way

773
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:36,560
out of this dark cell soon.

774
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:38,740
But, Feng Ying,

775
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:40,760
I don't get this.

776
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:44,500
General Li Yan is sure that you're Yang Yi's man.

777
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,570
Will he still trust you?

778
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:47,440
I've got proof.

779
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,290
Are you...?

780
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:48,830
Proof?

781
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,510
Getting involved

782
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,520
in the power struggle, too?

783
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:55,380
Won't you

784
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,030
be betraying Chief Xun?

785
00:43:58,870 --> 00:43:59,550
Over in the Wei State,

786
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,050
Guo Gang was told about

787
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:04,580
Recorder Chen's death.

788
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:06,460
Turns out, his best friend

789
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,360
was Baidi, a spy of Shu.

790
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:11,190
He lost his job because of it

791
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:13,710
while still in grief.

792
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:15,420
Actually,

793
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,040
it was Chancellor Mi who died.

794
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:20,060
Chen Gong is smart

795
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:24,050
and using his identity in the Wuxian Sect.

796
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:26,670
Qingping Plan is about to kick off

797
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:29,100
while Chen Gong and Huang Yu are

798
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,240
still working on the plan to steal the design.

799
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:34,480
Will everything go smoothly?

800
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,740
When will Baidi and Zhulong

801
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:38,480
battle each other head-on?

802
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:39,710
Keep up with me

803
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:42,940
for first-hand, exclusive intelligence!
