are you saying
(Li Yan's Villa in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

7
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,560
are you saying

8
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,100
it doesn't have to be

9
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,500
a real invasion by Wu?

10
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,500
As long as Chengdu receives such news,

11
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,180
with Prime Minister away,

12
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,690
His Majesty

13
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,860
will order General

14
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:56,490
to take care of it?

15
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:57,979
Yes.

16
00:01:58,850 --> 00:01:59,890
Absolutely.

17
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,690
In that case,

18
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,220
I can move

19
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,620
the provisions

20
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:09,210
to the front against Wu

21
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,060
in the name of the upcoming war,

22
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,740
stealing the firewood from under their pot.

23
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,540
That's an act of treason!

24
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,490
Please hear me out, sir.

25
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,860
This is the third step of the plan.

26
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,440
Sir,

27
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,490
your wisdom and leadership

28
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,960
are unrivaled.

29
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:38,540
Without supplies,

30
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,590
even a strategist like Prime Minister

31
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,100
won't be able to do much.

32
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:44,930
The Northern Expedition

33
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,060
won't go anywhere,

34
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,040
let alone succeed.

35
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,740
Prime Minister

36
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,750
turns a blind eye to Wu

37
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,900
but insists on battling in the north

38
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,600
at the cost of innocent lives.

39
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:00,860
Master,

40
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,740
after this,

41
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,030
your political ambition

42
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,530
will be realized.

43
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,050
Clerk Feng,

44
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,860
you'll be rewarded the most

45
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,910
for our success.

46
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,130
I'll go through fire and water

47
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,380
for you,

48
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,380
General!

49
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,340
Chief Xun,

50
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,140
you need to eat.

51
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,360
Other than Gu Zheng,

52
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,150
Gao Tangbing, as Zhulong, must've had other help

53
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,980
to communicate with Wei.

54
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,400
That's why they had to silence him quickly.

55
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,980
With that being said,

56
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,040
even if someone was there to kill him,

57
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,899
he'd definitely put up a fight.

58
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,490
That day, when I interrogated him without you,

59
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,600
he confessed how he killed Li Miao.

60
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,010
Take a look.

61
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,870
Once frozen,

62
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,530
you'll be hit

63
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:36,970
for sure.

64
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,220
I know

65
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,490
I'm making a mistake

66
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,610
by jumping to the conclusion

67
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,780
before finding the evidence.

68
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,050
Judging from your tone,

69
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,180
Chief,

70
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,260
are you suspecting

71
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,460
Clerk Feng?

72
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,540
He's too suspicious!

73
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,540
Think about it.

74
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,090
Who could

75
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,550
kill Gao Tangbing in the Agency silently

76
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:19,880
except for him?

77
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,990
The way Gao Tangbing died

78
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,170
reminds me of Li Miao's murder,

79
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,650
which was also

80
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,900
Feng Ying's idea.

81
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,170
Gao Tangbing didn't know he'd be next.

82
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,220
Now, I start to feel bad for him.

83
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,090
By the way,

84
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,740
when I talked to Feng Ying earlier today,

85
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,730
I noticed some dirt

86
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,340
on his sleeve

87
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,380
which could be from the wall in the cell,

88
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,620
but I'm not sure of it.

89
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,410
I'll go inside and check again.

90
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,090
Thanks.

91
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,230
Be very careful.

92
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:14,980
I will.

93
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,050
Feng Ying's deadly trap

94
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,090
will finish Prime Minister.

95
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:58,780
Take that as his way

96
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,290
to thank me for saving his life.

97
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,740
He was held accountable

98
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,730
for Zhulong's case

99
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:07,980
and he would've

100
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,310
ended up like Ma Su.

101
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:12,930
I was surprised

102
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,140
when you vouched for him.

103
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,540
Turns out

104
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,020
it's all worth it.

105
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,220
But he can't be trusted.

106
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,420
Don't lower your guard.

107
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,940
He's having no mercy

108
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:27,540
on Prime Minister

109
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,700
regardless of

110
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,090
their past.

111
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,370
It's to our advantage, though.

112
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:40,260
Once Zhuge Liang's force sets out,

113
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,100
we can take action in Jiangzhou.

114
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,650
Yes, sir. I'll go there to take care of it.

115
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,690
No, you stay in Nanzheng

116
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,740
to take the third step.

117
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:53,260
Yes, sir.

118
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,170
Good day, Clerk.

119
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:09,210
Chen Gong.

120
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:09,770
Yes, sir.

121
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10,470
Look,

122
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,650
you're General's disciple

123
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:13,760
and his old acquaintance's son.

124
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,460
I'll have to rely on you in the future.

125
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:18,860
You're flattering me, sir.

126
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,880
Your plan

127
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,730
is the key to our success.

128
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,380
The court in Chengdu

129
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,530
will see new faces soon.

130
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,660
I'm going to need your help

131
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,210
to gain a foothold.

132
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:37,340
Chen Gong, you're wonderful,

133
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,980
but too tactful.

134
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,539
I'll try not to be.

135
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,060
Clerk Feng.

136
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:01,780
Clerk Feng,

137
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,520
it's Pei Xu.

138
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,500
Chief Xun!

139
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,410
Look!

140
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:45,580
Do you remember

141
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,220
the wood plank that killed Gao Tangbing is chipped?

142
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,040
I found this on Clerk Feng's sleeve.

143
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:54,570
It proves

144
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,100
that he was in Gao Tangbing's cell.

145
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,930
But it's illegally obtained

146
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,540
and can no longer be used as evidence.

147
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,370
Now, we know it was him.

148
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,940
We can keep digging.

149
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,060
That fox

150
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,460
will give himself away eventually.

151
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:14,730
Right.

152
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,900
I'll talk to Chen Gong

153
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,490
about it.

154
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:19,100
Sure.

155
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,850
According to Liang Jian of Intelligence Agency,

156
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,810
Zhuge Liang has been allowed to leave.

157
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,510
His troop will soon arrive in Hanzhong

158
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:36,220
while we're busy battling Wu.

159
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,260
Sima Yi will keep Wu at bay,

160
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:45,540
but our defense along Mount Qi is weak.

161
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,460
Once Feng Ying steps down

162
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,300
and Chen Gong takes his place,

163
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,620
we'll know every move

164
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:52,850
of the Shu Army.

165
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,140
No need to worry about them.

166
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:58,060
How many members are left in Wuxian Sect?

167
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,900
About 4,000.

168
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,140
Despite heavy causalities,

169
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,710
we're deeply rooted in Hanzhong

170
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,740
after being here for more than 30 years.

171
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,820
Once the Wei troops arrive,

172
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,050
we'll be ready

173
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,970
to join the battle.

174
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:14,580
Good.

175
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,860
I need you to return to Hanzhong.

176
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,460
No problem.

177
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,000
Chen Gong is determined to get rid of Feng Ying,

178
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,660
but his sworn brother,

179
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,900
Xun Xu, in the Agency,

180
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,620
won't let Gao Tangbing's death go.

181
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,290
As long as he's there,

182
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,110
Chen Gong can be compromised.

183
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,990
He also

184
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,970
destroyed Wuxian Sect.

185
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,900
Chen Gong is too important to our strategy.

186
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,580
We can't take any risks.

187
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:50,860
Go to Nanzheng

188
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,780
and tell Chen Gong to kill Xun Xu.

189
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,290
Why him

190
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:59,620
as he's too close to Xun Xu

191
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,750
and too important to us?

192
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,150
He needs to take this step.

193
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,130
Poison on these three golden arrows

194
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,720
is highly toxic and it'll kill instantly.

195
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,450
Yes, sir.

196
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,280
I won't let you down.

197
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,140
(Chen Gong's Residence in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

198
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:37,780
Xun Xu?
(Chen Gong's Residence in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

199
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,400
(Chen Gong's Residence in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

200
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,180
Come on in.
(Chen Gong's Residence in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

201
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,260
What's up?

202
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,060
Do you need anything?

203
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,290
Can't I just check up on you?

204
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,640
I need

205
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,620
someone to talk to.

206
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,380
Sure. I'm listening.

207
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,460
Guess what I'm thinking of lately.

208
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,080
I'm also thinking of Yue every day.

209
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,100
No.

210
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,580
It's something else.

211
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,170
I'm wondering

212
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,780
what's the point of

213
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,340
doing what we do?

214
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,240
It's meaningless.

215
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,930
We're all against each other.

216
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,780
No one can be trusted.

217
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,410
Innocent people get killed all the time.

218
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,170
I don't get it.

219
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,650
We're at each other's throats for what?

220
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,600
To restore Han.

221
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,060
We talked about it.

222
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,980
I hope that's not just all talk.

223
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,490
You know,

224
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,660
Feng Ying said the same thing

225
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,110
when sending me to Tianshui to kill you.

226
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:46,900
He killed Gao Tangbing.

227
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,620
Xun Xu,

228
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:55,500
I know you're suspecting him...

229
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:56,660
I've got the evidence.

230
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,300
Pei Xu found it on his sleeve.

231
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,590
At least it proves

232
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,940
Feng Ying broke the wood plank

233
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,170
in Gao Tangbing's hand.

234
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,110
I checked. It's a match.

235
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:22,190
I know

236
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,000
it's not enough to convict Feng Ying,

237
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,820
but he's definitely a suspect.

238
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,140
Keep watching.

239
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,610
Leave nothing out.

240
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,010
I'm going to pick up Chief Xun.

241
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,140
Chengdu reports

242
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,280
that Prime Minister and his force will set out

243
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,600
and arrive in Nanzheng in seven days.

244
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,420
Have the scribe room

245
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,580
notify all departments that we're in wartime.

246
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:38,890
The Northern Expedition

247
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,100
shall take precedence.

248
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,930
Intelligence Analysis and Operations shall stand by,

249
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,670
awaiting Prime Minister's order.

250
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:45,820
Got it.

251
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,410
And

252
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:48,770
make necessary arrangements

253
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,530
for my visit to Qingshi Valley.

254
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,140
Qingshi Valley?

255
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,710
A Taoist priest has been cultivating himself

256
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,420
for years at Mount Chiyan there.

257
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:00,810
He's known for fortune-telling.

258
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:04,400
That must be Taoist Qingyun.

259
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,060
He's been practicing Taoism there

260
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:08,690
for at least 20 years.

261
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,450
They say he's all too powerful.

262
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,210
The Agency is unstable. I need some guidance.

263
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,450
I'll make the arrangement.

264
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,220
With Chief Yang's return,

265
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,400
it's tough being caught

266
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,290
between him and General Li.

267
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,670
You could use his divination.

268
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:32,220
Yes.

269
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:33,980
Go ahead.

270
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:35,570
Close the door for me.

271
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:44,380
What do you need me to do?

272
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,990
I need more people who can be trusted.

273
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,220
With Ma Sheng and Liao Hui gone

274
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,580
and the renewal of Internal Affairs,

275
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,410
only the most trustworthy

276
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:57,050
can be put to watch the head of the Agency.

277
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:57,740
Right.

278
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,100
Besides, such an operation

279
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,260
goes way beyond my level.

280
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,670
I know you're new to your post

281
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:09,420
and this is too much to ask,

282
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,580
but I must get to the bottom

283
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,370
of this case

284
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,330
so that Yue will rest in peace.

285
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:18,900
I see.

286
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,420
I'll ask General Ma Dai

287
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,650
for a team of skilled guards

288
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,790
out of Feng Ying's reach.

289
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:28,860
Don't worry.

290
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,990
I also need someone reliable

291
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,920
and skilled at tracking others.

292
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,610
Can't Pei Xu do it?

293
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,300
He can only cover one side

294
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,130
and I need him, too.

295
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,340
What's the other side?

296
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,690
When returning from Tianshui,

297
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,870
I found a girl near Wudu.

298
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:51,660
Miss Liu?

299
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:52,940
Yes.

300
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:54,270
Why keep her under watch?

301
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,250
Something doesn't seem right.

302
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:58,960
I don't think she was there by accident.

303
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,620
Has she done anything strange?

304
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,140
No.

305
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:09,140
But that makes her even more suspicious.

306
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,970
Come on, Xun Xu,

307
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,810
you're being paranoid.

308
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,190
You have to believe me.

309
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,340
I asked her to help get Feng Ying out.

310
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,810
You know that.

311
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,410
Yes.

312
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,720
She did it too well

313
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,780
for an ordinary girl.

314
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,780
Only the highly trained

315
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,790
would be able

316
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,250
to perform so well without fear!

317
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,970
"The lowly tend to be loyal.

318
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,390
The educated end up ungrateful."

319
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,060
Can't a harlot

320
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,420
be brave and helpful?

321
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,220
Do you really buy that?

322
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,790
Given our experience,

323
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,380
we can tell when we see an undercover spy.

324
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,760
It's a trained instinct.

325
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,140
Plus,

326
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,900
Feng Ying gave her to General Li

327
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,810
and put her in a villa in the south of the town.

328
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:01,980
Don't tell me

329
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,290
you're suspecting General Li as well.

330
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,570
Oh, I get it.

331
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:07,410
You're jealous,

332
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:10,100
aren't you?

333
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,100
I'm serious!

334
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,330
As am I.

335
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,540
All those things together

336
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,370
can't be good.

337
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,340
Hey,

338
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,480
I've seen Miss Liu once.

339
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,180
She's gorgeous.

340
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,130
You're a player.

341
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,380
Of course you've seen her in Ziyan House.

342
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,020
But Feng Ying isn't that kind of person.

343
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,330
I bet he's using her to get to General Li

344
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,320
for something.

345
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,130
You two's first encounter is quite romantic.

346
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,580
Do you

347
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:47,980
have a thing for her?

348
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,460
Yes or no?

349
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,820
Yes? Yes?

350
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,000
You wouldn't believe it if I said no.

351
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:58,740
But the thought of her real identity

352
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,610
stops me

353
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:03,050
from going further.

354
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,170
Fine.

355
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,500
If you're right about

356
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,770
Feng Ying and Miss Liu,

357
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,340
then

358
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,390
he's definitely up to something big

359
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,550
by going to such great lengths

360
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:22,210
to plant her

361
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,460
around General Li.

362
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:26,520
What's more,

363
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,060
if he and Guo Huai

364
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,490
are trading with each other covertly,

365
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,140
they'll need a go-between.

366
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,770
You think Miss Liu is Feng Ying's messenger?

367
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,660
We need to find out.

368
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:40,020
How?

369
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,930
Put down bait to lure him out.

370
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,120
If I'm right about everything,

371
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,260
Feng Ying will try to sabotage

372
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,640
the Northern Expedition.

373
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,420
Alright, fine.

374
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:54,830
I'll do whatever you say.

375
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,150
Have someone we can trust

376
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:00,660
watch Miss Liu closely.

377
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,660
Do you remember Lin Liang?

378
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:04,610
He's in Nanzheng, too?

379
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:07,460
When my cover was blown up

380
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:08,350
in Tianshui,

381
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:09,930
he went to hide in the mountains.

382
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,160
After we caught Zhulong,

383
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:14,090
I had him come over.

384
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,540
He'll arrive tonight.

385
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,880
He's smart and loyal.

386
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,690
He'll be able to help you.

387
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:22,900
That's great!

388
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:25,670
Chief Xun,

389
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:26,930
I'm here to pick you up.

390
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,520
Pei Xu, hold him.

391
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,880
Be careful.

392
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,380
Xun Xu,

393
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,150
Prime Minister will set out soon. There's a lot going on.

394
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,970
You must be careful.

395
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,770
I will.

396
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:43,050
Xun Xu.

397
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:45,540
Don't forget about Miss Liu.

398
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,020
Go.

399
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,100
Be careful.

400
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,740
Mister Mi, it's been a while.

401
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:21,610
Now that we're in the same boat,

402
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:23,610
just relax.

403
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:26,340
What do you want?

404
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:30,120
I'm sent by Inspector Guo, Guo Huai,

405
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,160
to pay my respects to Zhulong.

406
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:45,220
I didn't know

407
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,450
until he told me

408
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:50,170
that Saint Lady was your wife.

409
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,080
I'm sorry about

410
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,410
your loss, Clerk Chen.

411
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:03,080
Are you settling old scores with me?

412
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,220
I wouldn't dare.

413
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,490
I killed Di Yue

414
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,090
while you destroyed my sect.

415
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,460
Let's call it even.

416
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:34,660
I'm here for something else.

417
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:39,010
Inspector Guo personally ordered me

418
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,240
to help you eliminate the threat

419
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:44,690
and kill Xun Xu.

420
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,680
I'm not speaking for Chen Gong

421
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,320
but

422
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,570
he's come this far.

423
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,650
If anything goes wrong

424
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,200
and he gets caught,

425
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,480
all our effort will be in vain.

426
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:07,380
People change all the time,

427
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,130
especially in this line of business.

428
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,780
We're playing a big game

429
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,180
and Chen Gong is the key to victory.

430
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:18,340
We must be extremely cautious.

431
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:20,820
Guo Gang,

432
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,250
in this world,

433
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:25,820
people are most fickle.

434
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,370
In order to succeed,

435
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,850
you cannot trust anyone

436
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,330
or let others take the lead.

437
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,140
Think about it.

438
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,140
Once Chen Gong gets rid of Feng Ying

439
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:40,850
and takes over Siwencao Intelligence,

440
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:42,050
he'll become too powerful

441
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,660
to be kept on a string.

442
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:48,020
We'll lose control of him.

443
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:53,040
I'm not surprised if he changes his mind.

444
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:56,740
Once he becomes another Feng Ying,

445
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,420
we'll be nursing a viper

446
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,910
in our bosom.

447
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,180
I understand.

448
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:09,400
Killing Xun Xu is

449
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:12,130
his final test.

450
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,830
We need him to be a lone wolf.

451
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,240
By killing his wife,

452
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,780
colleague

453
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:21,860
and sworn brother,

454
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,520
he'll have nowhere to go

455
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:29,190
except for here.

456
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:34,410
Chief Xun is too deep in Zhulong's case.

457
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,670
It's only a matter of time

458
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,870
before he gets to you.

459
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:48,490
Is there a problem, Clerk Chen?

460
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:52,090
If both Feng Ying

461
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,580
and Chief Xun are gone,

462
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,920
I'll be considered

463
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:57,340
a suspect.

464
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:00,500
You don't want to kill Chief Xun

465
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:02,500
because of your relationship, do you?

466
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,580
I think

467
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,730
it's a bad idea in any way.

468
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,030
Your opinion doesn't matter.

469
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,980
Inspector Guo demands

470
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,650
that Xun Xu be killed

471
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,190
by no one but you.

472
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,250
Poison on these three golden arrows

473
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:25,470
will finish him instantly.

474
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:29,250
You're known for your accuracy in shooting.

475
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,540
This is an easy job.

476
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:46,540
Leaders

477
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,260
should trust their followers.

478
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,610
Clearly,

479
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,210
Inspector Guo

480
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,860
doesn't trust me.

481
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,660
Don't get it wrong, Clerk Chen.

482
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,580
He cares

483
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:07,660
too much about you

484
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,100
to expose you to any danger.

485
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:14,320
Reckless moves will only ruin Qingping Plan.

486
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,700
It won't.

487
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,020
The operation is all set up.

488
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:31,930
It won't be in Nanzheng

489
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:34,140
or cause you

490
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:36,690
any trouble.

491
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,180
I'll see you outside Xixiang.

492
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,090
Look,

493
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:15,450
(Li Yan's Camp in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)
Look,

494
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:15,930
(Li Yan's Camp in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

495
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,830
Zhuge Liang's force has left Chengdu.
(Li Yan's Camp in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

496
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:18,820
Zhuge Liang's force has left Chengdu.

497
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:23,380
They'll soon go through Hanzhong and take Chencang Road.

498
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,700
Then they'll ask me to send provisions.

499
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,330
There are two delivery routes

500
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,170
from Mount Dingjun.

501
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,610
The east one is longer

502
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,660
than the west,

503
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:39,540
but we have to go east.

504
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:44,240
Through Sanguan Pass, the Mian River, Xie Valley,

505
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:48,480
Wuzhang Plains to Chencang.

506
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,100
The south of Sanguan Pass is my territory.

507
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:53,040
Deliver everything there

508
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:56,620
and give it to Wei Yan.

509
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,060
Brilliant, sir!

510
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:01,650
Once we finish the delivery,

511
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,300
whatever happens after

512
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:05,140
will have nothing to do with you.

513
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,940
Wei Yan and the provisions

514
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,490
will have to go along

515
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:11,130
the Mian River.

516
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:14,670
Down the River,

517
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:20,260
we can have Chen Gong destroy the dam

518
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,140
and it'll flood.

519
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,500
At this time of the year,

520
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,890
the rain along Sanguan Pass never stops.

521
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,260
Natural disasters such as floods do happen.

522
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:31,540
Meanwhile, Wu is invading us.

523
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:34,050
I'll have to send the troops and the supplies

524
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,200
to the front.

525
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,340
My action is fully justified.

526
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,440
You've planned out everything, sir.

527
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:47,530
But we need a reason to go east.

528
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,720
General Ma Dai monitors the checkpoints along the way.

529
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,500
If he sends out a warning

530
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:56,090
that mudslides buried the west route

531
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,670
and it won't reopen soon,

532
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:01,070
then the east route will be the only choice

533
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,960
for delivery.

534
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,550
So,

535
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,700
we need to win Ma Dai over.

536
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:10,940
He's Ma Chao's cousin

537
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,390
and he followed him to leave Zhang Lu for us.

538
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:15,530
Ma Chao was a hero

539
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,300
but he chose to lie low with his cousin

540
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,290
before the late emperor over the last ten years for safety.

541
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:21,940
Six years ago, Ma Dai lost his cousin.

542
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:24,120
He joined Prime Minister halfway

543
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:26,130
and ended up abandoned,

544
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:28,410
so he's been unappreciated.

545
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,760
Sir,

546
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,710
the slightest gesture of appreciation from us

547
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:35,560
might be able to win him over.

548
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,040
I hope so.

549
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,270
I'll see to it.

550
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,210
(Chengdu, the Shu State)

551
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,600
(Zhuge)

552
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,640
(General to Suppress the North)

553
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,380
"Green the mallow in the garden,

554
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,950
waiting for sunlight to dry the morning dew.

555
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:30,410
Bright spring warms the land,

556
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,820
breathing life into all beings."

557
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,570
What a beautiful poem!

558
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,520
"People living in this world

559
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,940
come and go like dust."

560
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:43,450
As nice as it seems,

561
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,790
spring is fleeting.

562
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,660
You look preoccupied lately.

563
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,890
Is something bothering you?

564
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,380
No, I'm just a bit down.

565
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,380
I'll sit in the pavilion for a while.

566
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:07,810
Guard the entrance of the backyard.

567
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,449
I don't want to be disturbed.

568
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:15,199
General favors you the most.

569
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,820
No one would dare to disturb you.

570
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,290
Stop making fun of me!

571
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:20,889
I'll wait for you there.

572
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,540
Chief Xun,

573
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:50,340
this way.

574
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,780
Will she come?

575
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:57,610
She will.

576
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,910
Are we

577
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,970
moving too fast?

578
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,700
We're running out of time.

579
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:09,270
The Northern Expedition is about to begin.

580
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,050
We need to eliminate all the threats,

581
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:12,810
or there'll be another false intelligence case.

582
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:14,550
You're right.

583
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:17,700
Will Feng Ying be out of our hands?

584
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,200
No way. He's under our control.

585
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:22,930
Don't you find it strange

586
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:25,020
that Feng Ying would be that dumb

587
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,700
to leave such obvious evidence?

588
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,210
It seems that we've got dirt on him,

589
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,330
but actually,

590
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,170
we're being led by the nose.

591
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,740
Chen Gong is strange, too.

592
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,900
How could he miss

593
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:43,260
those loopholes I found?

594
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:48,890
Clerk Chen must've had his reason.

595
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:53,290
I guess.

596
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,910
-Pei Xu.
-Yes.

597
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,950
Stand guard for me over there.

598
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:58,580
Yes, sir.

599
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:00,100
See you later.

600
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:51,570
Long time no see, Miss Liu.

601
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,440
I knew you were injured,

602
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,980
but it's worse than I thought.

603
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:57,530
Or I would've gone to check on you.

604
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,020
Who told you that?

605
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,150
When Clerk Feng came to see General Li,

606
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,740
I asked him about you

607
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:07,350
and he said that.

608
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:10,410
I'm here

609
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:12,860
to tell you something.

610
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,730
What is it?

611
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:26,660
A while ago,

612
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:29,890
I had you

613
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:31,650
steal Clerk Feng's seal.

614
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,220
No matter what that was for,

615
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,660
I used you.

616
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,980
It shouldn't have happened.

617
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,460
I'm sorry.

618
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,490
I don't expect you to forgive me.

619
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,400
This is too much!

620
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,270
I'm not bothered at all.

621
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:02,380
But it bothers me deeply.

622
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,610
Hadn't it been for me,

623
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,690
you wouldn't have known Clerk Feng

624
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:10,500
or

625
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,930
been sent to General Li.

626
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,690
Xun Xu,

627
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,430
sometimes,

628
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,090
I don't have a choice.

629
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:34,620
You don't?

630
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:38,820
Right.

631
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,460
I know.

632
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,740
All that's happened

633
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,020
makes me realize something.

634
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,100
Like what?

635
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,810
That you, Miss Liu,

636
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:58,980
might be a Wei spy.

637
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,620
You must be joking.

638
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:14,940
(Siwencao Intelligence in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

639
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,790
Please let me know

640
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:19,480
when the Wu Plan is launched.

641
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:20,850
Of course.

642
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:24,210
You'll be updated on every detail.

643
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:29,770
General Li needs me for urgent military affairs.

644
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,240
I'm entrusting everything here to you.

645
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,400
Take care, gentlemen.

646
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,820
We'll be working day and night

647
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,860
in the next six months.

648
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:48,330
Clerk Feng, I've got some fine tea

649
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,140
for you to taste.

650
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,910
That's very thoughtful of you. Let's go.

651
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:55,590
Let's go. Please.

652
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,730
Do you know Gao Tangbing?

653
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:05,220
Yes.

654
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,520
I met him in Ziyan House.

655
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:09,740
According to the account book,

656
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:14,140
he went there three times every month

657
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,220
only to see you.

658
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:19,180
What's wrong? He wasn't paid enough

659
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:20,460
to see me?

660
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,940
He had never been there

661
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,620
before you came to Nanzheng.

662
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,090
His real identity

663
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,980
was a Wei spy

664
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,580
called Zhulong.

665
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:34,510
A spy

666
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,900
visited someone three times a month.

667
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,890
What would you think about that person?

668
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,220
I don't know

669
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:47,730
what you're talking about.

670
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,490
Before he died, he told me

671
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:54,930
you were his partner.

672
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,460
I see.

673
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,190
You aren't bothered

674
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:10,040
by my involvement with

675
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,540
Clerk Feng and General Li,

676
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:15,250
but by the fact that I used you.

677
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:17,870
Is that so?

678
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,100
Do you think

679
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:27,420
all that's happened

680
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,050
since you found me outside Wudu

681
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,810
is all staged?

682
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,200
You tell me.

683
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,970
Do you know my feelings for you?

684
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:44,450
You must've felt something.

685
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:48,610
Is that also fake?

686
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,390
Despite your accusation,

687
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,090
you have no proof.

688
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:13,940
But that's not a problem.

689
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:19,390
Shu and Wei are sworn enemies.

690
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:24,180
You'll kill everyone if you have to.

691
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:30,300
If you think I'm a spy,

692
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,330
arrest me now.

693
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:40,760
I'm exhausted.

694
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,210
I'd rather rest in peace.

695
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,670
(The 24 Strategies of War, The Wind Blows from Longxi)
(Intelligence Agency in Longxi)

696
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:24,860
(The Nineteenth Strategy, Steal the Firewood from under the Pot)

697
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:28,540
I knew it.

698
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:30,850
Chen Gong and Feng Ying

699
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:32,880
talked Li Yan into

700
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,160
removing the provisions

701
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:37,960
for Zhuge Liang's troops

702
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,760
in the name of battling Wu

703
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:41,740
at the risk of treason.

704
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:42,790
As he said,

705
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,540
to steal the firewood from under their pot.

706
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,530
How evil that is

707
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,480
to obstruct the Northern Expedition!

708
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,840
And Xun Xu is still looking into

709
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:53,930
Gao Tangbing's mysterious death.

710
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,020
He found evidence

711
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,170
on Feng Ying's sleeve

712
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:58,930
and had people

713
00:43:58,960 --> 00:43:59,830
watch his every move.

714
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:00,910
Meanwhile,

715
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:03,030
Liu Ying is his another target

716
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:05,090
as she could be the messenger

717
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:07,050
between Guo Huai and Feng Ying.

718
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:08,240
Poor Xun Xu

719
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:09,670
is caught in a dilemma

720
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:11,870
and he can only ask Chen Gong for help.

721
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:13,960
That's bad!

722
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,470
What's worse,

723
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,370
that cult leader, Huang Yu is back.

724
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,570
He showed up unannounced at Chen Gong's place.

725
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:21,350
You're freaking us out!

726
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:24,200
He said Guo Huai sent him

727
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:26,360
to help Chen Gong kill Xun Xu.

728
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,830
That's more threat

729
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:29,060
than help.

730
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:30,590
And Chen Gong must

731
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,050
get rid of his sworn brother

732
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,050
to prove his loyalty to Wei.

733
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:35,340
Guo Huai is such a snake!

734
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,950
Things are taking a sharp turn.

735
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:38,060
Here come the questions:

736
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:38,840
Will Chen Gong

737
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:41,040
kill Xun Xu?

738
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:42,850
Will their brotherhood

739
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:44,100
end there?

740
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,450
Will Shu stand no chance

741
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,180
against Wei?

742
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:50,140
Stay tuned.

743
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:51,870
Keep up with me

744
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,330
for the inside scoop.
