This is Clerk Feng of the Agency!

4
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:44,440
Who are you?

5
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,479
Xun Xu,

6
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,590
what is this?

7
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,310
Clerk Feng,

8
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,180
you're under arrest for

9
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,790
leaking confidential military intelligence

10
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,640
to Wei.

11
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,230
You're abusing your power!

12
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,310
Is there any proof?

13
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:11,150
Bring him in.

14
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:18,990
Clerk Feng,

15
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,430
you wrote the letter

16
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,170
in this gift box, didn't you?

17
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,260
Xun Xu,

18
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,540
I'm your superior.

19
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,390
You don't have the right

20
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:34,350
to make the arrest.

21
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:55,940
Feng Ying...

22
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,740
This has nothing to do

23
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,910
with Sun Ling or the others.

24
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:04,660
Feng Ying...

25
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,390
It's fine.

26
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,260
Don't worry.

27
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,500
Take him away.

28
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,110
Prime Minister.

29
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,110
Prime Minister?

30
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,470
Nanzheng is right ahead.

31
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,190
Are we going in to rest?

32
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:48,910
No.

33
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,030
We camp outside.

34
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,110
Yes, sir.

35

(Li Yan's Camp in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

36

General.

(Li Yan's Camp in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

38
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:59,740
What's wrong?
(Li Yan's Camp in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

39
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,920
(Li Yan's Camp in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

40
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:02,930
Sir,

41
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,390
Prime Minister's force has arrived.

42
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:06,830
Are they coming in?

43
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,770
No. They're leaving tomorrow.

44
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:10,860
I see.

45
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,620
I'll visit him outside at one.

46
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:14,870
General,

47
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,269
there's something else.

48
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,220
What is it? Just tell me.

49
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,270
Feng Ying

50
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,710
got arrested.

51
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:26,750
What?

52
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,330
When he took the first step of the plan

53
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,120
to tip Wei off on the Northern Expedition,

54
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,350
they caught him on the spot.

55
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,510
Was the Wei spy for pickup also caught?

56
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,060
No.

57
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,950
That was a secure drop spot.

58
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,760
The Wei spy was still on the way.

59
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,290
I thought

60
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,320
they found the drop spot.

61
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:48,680
But they found

62
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,590
the letter Feng Ying wrote.

63
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,000
Who made the arrest?

64
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,260
Chief Xun of Internal Affairs.

65
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,260
What?

66
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,150
He was overreaching himself

67
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,780
by arresting the head of the Agency!

68
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,230
Who authorized it?

69
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,110
He was there with Prime Minister's badge.

70
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,560
I thought Chen Gong

71
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,420
got the Agency under control!

72
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,390
He seemed to be kept out of the loop.

73
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,470
Get my carriage.

74
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,840
I'm going to pay Zhuge Liang a visit.

75
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:23,830
Yes, sir.

76
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:34,750
(Zhuge Liang's Tent outside Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

77
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,340
All of you, go!

78
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,820
This is ridiculous!

79
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,430
I coached Feng Ying myself.

80
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,240
He's not a traitor.

81
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:50,590
Prime Minister,

82
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,420
think about Li Miao.

83
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,760
People are selfish

84
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,370
by nature.

85
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,430
Feng Ying has been playing the spy game

86
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,320
with Wei for over a decade.

87
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,780
He can get brainwashed

88
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,370
and defect to them.

89
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,750
I didn't believe it at first,

90
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,590
but Xun Xu of Internal Affairs

91
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,170
insisted that there's more to Zhulong's case

92
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,300
and kept digging under pressure

93
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,150
until he found the clues

94
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,080
and caught Feng Ying

95
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,780
in the act.

96
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,910
Xun Xu?

97
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,250
Yes, it was Chief Xun.

98
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,540
The letter is Feng Ying's writing, no doubt.

99
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,640
It includes information

100
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,550
about the deployment of our vanguard

101
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,730
and the target.

102
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,290
Hadn't Chief Xun intercepted it,

103
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,190
General Wei Yan and his troops

104
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,430
would be wiped out by Wei.

105
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,659
I know Feng Ying.

106
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,310
What we're seeing

107
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,460
isn't the whole truth.

108
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,260
Take Feng Ying into custody.

109
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,230
I'll interrogate him myself

110
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,540
after the battle.

111
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,860
Is Chen Gong in charge of the Agency now?

112
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:13,710
Yes.

113
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,340
The war may break out at any moment.

114
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:19,870
We need the Agency

115
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,380
for intelligence.

116
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,750
It has to remain stable.

117
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,670
We cannot fall apart from the inside.

118
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:26,550
Yes, sir.

119
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,590
Is he still in the Agency?

120
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,510
Yes, in a maximum-security cell.

121
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,270
What's the preliminary result?

122
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,260
Xun Xu identifies him as the real Zhulong

123
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,190
and the killer of Gao Tangbing.

124
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,940
Find a way in

125
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,800
to see Feng Ying quickly.

126
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:04,780
Tell him,

127
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,450
despite his failure,

128
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,200
the rest of the plan will go on.

129
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,760
As long as he keeps his mouth shut,

130
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,550
the day Zhuge Liang fails is

131
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,130
the day he regains his freedom

132
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,080
and wins a spot in court.

133
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,360
All on one condition

134
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,670
that he remains silent.

135
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:21,670
Yes, sir.

136
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,640
If things start to look bad,

137
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,140
pin everything on him.

138
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,060
Sir,

139
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,540
as wicked as he is,

140
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,390
he's smart enough

141
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,950
to know what he can and cannot do.

142
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,950
Tell Chen Gong

143
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:40,860
to hush this case up

144
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,309
at all costs

145
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:43,900
and

146
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,550
take over

147
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,060
Feng Ying's communication channels with Wei.

148
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,510
From now on,

149
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,270
everything will be on him.

150
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,150
Go.

151
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,450
Yes, sir.

152
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,510
(Nanzheng County)
Yes, sir.

153
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,910
Yes, sir.

154
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,790
What do you think about Chen Gong?

155
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,870
I barely know him.

156
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,660
He's committed and capable.

157
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,430
Since His Majesty

158
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,590
assigned Li Yan

159
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,630
to logistic support for our troops,

160
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,700
I've had my concerns.

161
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,510
Chief Imperial Secretary, Chen Zhen, once said

162
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,830
before going on a diplomatic mission to Wu

163
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,420
that Li Yan got knives inside.

164
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,100
He's dangerous.

165
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,510
Is Li Yan in Nanzheng?

166
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,060
Yes.

167
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,670
I need you there

168
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,430
for the sake of the Northern Expedition.

169
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,800
The Agency is our eyes and ears.

170
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,320
Chen Gong

171
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,020
can use your assistance.

172
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:08,950
Prime Minister,

173
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,940
without a legitimate title

174
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,940
and the power endowed,

175
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,190
I won't be of much help.

176
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,870
Under this circumstance,

177
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,640
I'm sending you

178
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,570
as my assistant

179
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,130
to help and supervise them.

180
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,400
Yes, sir.

181
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,140
(Siwencao Intelligence in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

182
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:32,900
Pei Xu.
(Siwencao Intelligence in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

183
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:37,220
(Siwencao Intelligence in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

184
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,310
Pei Xu!

185
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,270
Chief Yin.

186
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,340
Congratulations!

187
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,270
On what, Chief Yin?

188
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,870
Internal Affairs

189
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,060
did a terrific job

190
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,490
for the Agency!

191
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:56,970
Chief Xun

192
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,220
will soon

193
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,940
be promoted

194
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,590
and move to the West Bureau.

195
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,140
You must be joking.

196
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,390
Chief Xun has got on many people's bad side

197
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,260
who might be eager to bury him.

198
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,170
Come on!

199
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,020
Look who's joking now!

200
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,140
Isn't that celebration liquor?

201
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:15,860
This?

202
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,070
Chief Xun is suffering from back pain.

203
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,980
The physician says he needs supplements.

204
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:24,990
Pei Xu,

205
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,590
if you hear good news,

206
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,630
do let me know, please.

207
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,510
We could use that

208
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,940
to boost our morale.

209
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,590
That

210
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,190
you don't need to ask, Chief Yin.

211
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,270
Well then...

212
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:38,990
Please.

213
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:43,600
Chief Xun.

214
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:44,710
Chief Xun!

215
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,380
I've got drinks.

216
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,460
Now that Feng Ying is captured,

217
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,220
we should celebrate.

218
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,690
Sir,

219
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,300
the case is closed.

220
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,150
There's nothing to worry about.

221
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:58,870
Am I right?

222
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,520
Let's drink.

223
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:08,150
Cheers!

224
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,660
Ever since Jieting's false intelligence case,

225
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,990
we've been walked over in the Agency.

226
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,710
Finally, we can hold our heads up high!

227
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,150
Internal Affairs is

228
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,100
to do all the dirty work.

229
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,230
I'm used to it.

230
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,180
Yes.

231
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:35,820
Of course.

232
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,200
Now, they know

233
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,440
you're right.

234
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,270
Sir,

235
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,060
one more cup.

236
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,350
Sir...

237
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,340
Why aren't you drinking?

238
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,660
The arrest of Feng Ying

239
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,560
was too easy

240
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,380
to convince me.

241
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,110
You call that easy

242
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,260
when you can barely walk

243
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,110
and just survived death?

244
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,310
Believe me, that's not easy!

245
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,510
I mean it.

246
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:42,900
General.

247
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,260
How did it go?

248
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,190
Feng Ying got the message.

249
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,830
He'd never sell you out.

250
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,100
He knows

251
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,990
what's the right thing to do.

252
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,470
It's life and death.

253
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,110
He doesn't have a choice.

254
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,300
We didn't get to do much

255
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,430
and caught him already?

256
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,700
That doesn't make sense.

257
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,500
Come on.

258
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,180
A fox like him

259
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,790
can make mistakes, too.

260
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,720
But

261
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,060
not stupid mistakes.

262
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,900
After Gao Tangbing suddenly died,

263
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,540
dirt and the wood chip were found on Feng Ying's sleeve.

264
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,230
Then you discovered

265
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:36,140
the code he used to see Wei spies

266
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,110
before we caught him

267
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,580
sending out intelligence in his own writing

268
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,150
at Mount Chiyan.

269
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,380
Such key evidence

270
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,270
was handed to us like this?

271
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,660
It all went too well

272
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,630
as if

273
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,820
prearranged.

274
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,430
Clerk Feng was the head of the Agency.

275
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,470
If someone could arrange all that,

276
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,350
it'd mean Wei spies were already...

277
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:09,710
No.

278
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,860
I never think Feng Ying is a Wei spy.

279
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,750
He's a broker at most,

280
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,340
selling intelligence for his own benefits.

281
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,780
He isn't a Wei spy

282
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,180
and certainly not Zhulong.

283
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,190
Or our entire intelligence system

284
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,100
and all the spies on the ground would've been exposed.

285
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,950
Baidi couldn't have worked undercover for so long

286
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:33,990
and returned safely.

287
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,660
Sir,

288
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,590
are you saying...

289
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,790
I have a theory

290
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,910
but I'm afraid to pursue it.

291
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,630
What theory?

292
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,440
Feng Ying

293
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,700
let himself be caught.

294
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,310
That's impossible!

295
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,740
I believe in facts

296
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,840
and that's what they say.

297
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,870
It's unbelievable!

298
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,500
I mean, why would he

299
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,860
hand himself on a plate to us?

300
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,190
A man like him

301
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,730
would never sacrifice himself

302
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,070
unless

303
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,110
he was to cover for someone more important.

304
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,700
Pei Xu.

305
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,990
Bring me all the files

306
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:42,900
about Feng Ying.

307
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:43,940
I need to go through everything.

308
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:44,660
Yes, sir.

309
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,950
You two, guard the entrance.

310
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,420
Let no one in

311
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,630
without my order.

312
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,200
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

313
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,230
Feng Ying.

314
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,070
Clerk Feng.

315
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,700
I've confirmed with Chief Yang

316
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,910
about the rebellion in Zizhong.

317
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,740
What you said is true

318
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,860
that you had been ordered

319
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,760
to leak our military intelligence to Wei

320
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,910
to lure them in

321
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,270
and wipe out

322
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,600
Xiahou Yuan's force.

323
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,140
True or not,

324
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,380
that doesn't matter anymore.

325
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,380
Clerk Feng,

326
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,920
you might think it's not,

327
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,580
but it matters the most

328
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,110
to me.

329
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,060
Now, I know my father

330
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,500
died for our state.

331
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,420
It was a worthy death.

332
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,980
And you made yourself

333
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,660
Gao Tangbing's killer

334
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,250
to push me forward.

335
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,780
You'd give it your all

336
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,900
and bring shame on yourself

337
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,860
all for

338
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,910
the restoration of Han.

339
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,910
No one else could do that.

340
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,310
Clerk Feng,

341
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,350
you deserve my full respect.

342
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:31,830
Chen Gong,

343
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,310
thank you!

344
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:40,060
Thank you for never doubting me!

345
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:43,790
Feng Ying,

346
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,510
a toast to you

347
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,550
with tea.

348
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,160
Clerk Feng,

349
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,950
what else do you need me to do?

350
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,610
Live on.

351
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,280
I won't... let you down.

352
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:43,660
Chen Gong,

353
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,390
the rest is up to you.

354
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,550
Pei Xu.

355
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,140
I need records about

356
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,580
Ma Qin and Gao Sheng besieging Zizhong

357
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,310
in 218 A.D.

358
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,030
218 A.D.?

359
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:24,710
Yes.

360
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,780
That's ten years ago, right?

361
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,670
Find them now.

362
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,420
Yes, sir.

363
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,030
The last step of the Qingping Plan is

364
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,260
I need to be the head of the Agency,

365
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,340
keep General Li Yan on a string

366
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,190
and control the heart of Shu

367
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,640
or at least,

368
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,180
play him off

369
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,670
against Prime Minister

370
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,190
so that Wei will be able to

371
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,740
take advantage of the situation

372
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,650
and

373
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,690
destroy Shu and Wu one by one

374
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,420
to rule the entire land.

375
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,900
Guo Huai's plan

376
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,470
wasn't too bad.

377
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,590
But he had no idea

378
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,910
Chen Gong was ordered

379
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,180
to work with him.

380
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:06,950
When he initiated the Qingping Plan

381
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,470
after Jieting's false intelligence case,

382
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,380
I reported to Chief Yang

383
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,070
and we decided right away

384
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,670
to meet his plan with our own.

385
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,840
Their target was Li Yan.

386
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:22,150
We'd let them have him

387
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,870
by sowing discord among ourselves.

388
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,660
After deliberation,

389
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,900
Chief Yang and I agreed on this strategy

390
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,550
and Xun Xu was the one

391
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,550
to help us proceed.

392
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,030
With him in Tianshui,

393
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,300
he worked with you

394
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:46,360
to dig out the Wei spy, Gao Tangbing,

395
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,310
and helped you

396
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,860
complete the Qingping Plan

397
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,260
without knowing anything about it.

398
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:54,410
At this stage,

399
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,380
we've got Li Yan. All is under control.

400
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,510
Once his true colors come out,

401
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,500
he's done.

402
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,540
But he has

403
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,980
His Majesty's secret edict.

404
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,190
That is a problem.

405
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,240
I'll use

406
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:11,460
Zhulong's cover

407
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,670
and ask Liu Ying to take care of the edict

408
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,540
at General Guo Huai's order.

409
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,660
Good.

410
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,730
Without that edict,

411
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,870
Li Yan will have no leverage.

412
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,110
Clerk Feng,

413
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,660
do you have an escape plan?

414
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:34,670
No.

415
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:37,510
I need to remain a Wei spy.

416
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,790
That way,

417
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:40,970
we can nail Li Yan down to his crime.

418
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,030
Feng Ying has been ready for death

419
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,270
ever since our plan began.

420
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,900
This is too big a case.

421
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,230
Without Feng Ying,

422
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:55,870
Li Yan going this far would be unnatural.

423
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,350
The chain of evidence wouldn't hold.

424
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,430
Once they find out

425
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,060
this whole thing is entrapment,

426
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,700
it'll provoke a storm

427
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,030
in Chengdu

428
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,790
and

429
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,510
Li Yan will fight back hard.

430
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,850
In that case,

431
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,670
all that we've done will go to waste

432
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,760
and Prime Minister will be held accountable.

433
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,570
We can't afford the dire consequences.

434
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,740
Only if I'm regarded as a Wei spy

435
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:32,180
will the rest make sense.

436
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,150
It's all for

437
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,590
the great restoration.

438
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:39,870
Feng Ying,

439
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,070
another toast to you.

440
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,350
Bringing Li Yan down is

441
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,180
only our first step.

442
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,020
Chen Gong,

443
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:05,140
you were tasked with the Qingping Plan

444
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,350
and followed Guo Huai's order

445
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:09,630
to get where you are.

446
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,990
My case is different.

447
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,670
With

448
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,670
Guo Huai's complete trust,

449
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,300
you'll be

450
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,340
the Agency's dagger

451
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,470
right into the heart of Wei.

452
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,100
It's possible

453
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,380
that you will

454
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,170
play a significant role in the future.

455
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,030
An asset in the center is extremely valuable.

456
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:42,810
Chen Gong,

457
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,970
you're more important than anyone.

458
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,620
We're battling a stronger enemy.

459
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,550
We need you

460
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:57,670
to bury Wei and restore Han.

461
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,430
Two days ago...

462
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:07,870
Two days ago,

463
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:09,810
Guo Huai

464
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,870
sent Huang Yu to Hanzhong

465
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,390
to see me.

466
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,470
He asked me...

467
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,410
He asked me to kill Xun Xu.

468
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,460
That's his final test

469
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,920
for you.

470
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:39,830
What's your plan?

471
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,180
When Clerk Feng was giving assignments,

472
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,790
I said over and over

473
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:52,540
not to bring Xun Xu in.

474
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:53,380
He isn't born...

475
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:55,230
He isn't born to do this.

476
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,070
You're wrong.

477
00:26:58,860 --> 00:26:59,790
He was

478
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,120
the perfect one for the job

479
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,470
and the only one

480
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,890
who could

481
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,230
carry on his task

482
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,000
behind the Agency's back

483
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,220
while completing our plan

484
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,150
without everyone knowing it.

485
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,910
Without him,

486
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,710
you wouldn't be here.

487
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,310
Yes.

488
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:22,740
I know.

489
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,950
Now that

490
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,810
his job is done,

491
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,080
we need him dead

492
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,510
for the great cause.

493
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,230
Chen Gong,

494
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,800
you cannot blow up your cover before Guo Huai.

495
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,500
We need him to trust you,

496
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,500
or our plan will still fail.

497
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:52,820
On top of that,

498
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:55,750
if Xun Xu keeps digging,

499
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,640
our plan will be exposed,

500
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,020
everyone involved

501
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,460
will be slaughtered,

502
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,350
and the Agency will be crushed.

503
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,340
Han's legacy

504
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,380
tops life and death.

505
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:15,350
Chen Gong,

506
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,190
do not be soft.

507
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:49,160
(Li Yan's Villa in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

508
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,340
-General?
-Miss Liu!

509
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:42,780
Miss Liu...

510
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,430
What... what are you doing here?

511
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,030
I got sleepy when playing the instrument

512
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,020
and came here to take a nap.

513
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,310
The winter

514
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,700
has come.

515
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,340
It's damp and chilled to the bone.

516
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,860
Don't catch a cold.

517
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,940
If you care about me,

518
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:01,300
come back more often then.

519
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,420
I'm lonely

520
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:04,990
when you're away.

521
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,280
I promise

522
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,110
to spare more time for you.

523
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,310
Easy, Chief Xun!

524
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,570
What's wrong?

525
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:42,610
Read this.

526
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,570
Feng Ying

527
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,450
tipped the Wei off on Zizhong.

528
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:00,750
That's not the point.

529
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,730
Chen Fu

530
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,930
beat the rebels back as General Li Yan

531
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,320
and died on the battlefield.

532
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:11,990
Yes.

533
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,630
It was tough.

534
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,700
Chen Fu,

535
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,830
courtesy name Guoshan,

536
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,670
was Chen Gong's father.

537
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:32,980
In that case,

538
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,710
Clerk Chen must hate Feng Ying's guts

539
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:38,030
for his father's death.

540
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,930
During Chen Gong's three years in Wei,

541
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:47,650
he must've found out

542
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,810
what happened then.

543
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,500
Did he fight his way back

544
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,900
to avenge his father's murder on Feng Ying?

545
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,340
No way!

546
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,780
He'd never use his post to get revenge.

547
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,310
Anyway,

548
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,550
there must be something about them

549
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:21,790
that we haven't found out.

550
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,430
There can be a second,

551
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,790
third or fourth Northern Expedition,

552
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:50,870
but as long as Li Yan is still here,

553
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,230
we'll never be safe.

554
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,580
I know.

555
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,970
National safety trumps friendship.

556
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:02,310
I'm not sure

557
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,870
if you can do this to Xun Xu.

558
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,460
Why not let him in?

559
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,940
I can talk to him.

560
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:12,060
What if he won't listen?

561
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,910
I also thought he could join us

562
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:18,940
but Clerk Feng said no.

563
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:21,980
It took me a while

564
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,740
to understand his decision.

565
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:25,260
The risk is too high.

566
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,700
We can't afford the consequences.

567
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:31,510
And Xun Xu is

568
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:33,470
too righteous

569
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,510
and stubborn.

570
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,590
Our plan involves setting up

571
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,630
one of the highest-ranking officials in court.

572
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:41,510
The fewer know, the better.

573
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:48,500
We're going along with the Qingping Plan

574
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:51,350
not only to get rid of Li Yan,

575
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:53,710
but more importantly,

576
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,940
to keep your cover as long as possible.

577
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,230
If Xun Xu stays,

578
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,590
you won't be able to do anything

579
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,550
and the deceased

580
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,390
will die in vain.

581
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:09,909
Go back

582
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:11,909
to Nanzheng quickly.

583
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,500
Our schedule is tight.

584
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:16,350
Finish the job as soon as possible.

585
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,020
I'll get it done.

586
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:26,830
Chen Gong,

587
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,949
it's all for the great cause.

588
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,050
We're counting on you.

589
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:22,390
We aren't to raid the checkpoint

590
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,650
but to let them know we're coming.

591
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,300
As long as I show up,

592
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:29,090
Internal Affairs in Nanzheng will know it.

593
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,180
Then you get out of

594
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,110
Sanguan Pass with the main force,

595
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,070
build the dam to stop the flow upstream

596
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,940
of the north of the Pass and await my signal.

597
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,020
Yes, sir.

598
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:40,450
Guan Qi,

599
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,220
you're with me,

600
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,790
awaiting Xun Xu.

601
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:44,580
Yes, sir.

602
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,430
Move it.

603
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,950
Do we need so many of us

604
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,750
to kill a junior chief?

605
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,220
We aren't to kill Xun Xu,

606
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,710
but Chen Gong.

607
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,510
He was following Guo Huai's order

608
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:12,950
to destroy our sect

609
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:14,230
and we couldn't do anything about him.

610
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,580
Now, it's also Guo Huai's order

611
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:20,860
that he must kill his sworn brother.

612
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:22,700
If he tries anything funny,

613
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,870
finish him

614
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,100
immediately.

615
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,670
Consider it done!

616
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,710
I've been waiting

617
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,380
for this day!

618
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:40,840
(Xixiang Checkpoint, the Shu State)

619
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,180
Stop! Security check!

620
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,660
Stop, guys.

621
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,720
Officer Xu,

622
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:48,990
it's me!

623
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:50,370
Who are you?

624
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,260
Chen Dong from Mianzhu.

625
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,220
Long time no see.

626
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,780
Plum wine...

627
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,190
Let's go!

628
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:07,420
Let's go!

629
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:08,780
Let's go!

630
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,400
General Guo Huai has assembled the troops

631
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,870
(Li Yan's Villa in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)
General Guo Huai has assembled the troops

632
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:26,300
(Li Yan's Villa in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

633
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,190
to begin their counterattack
(Li Yan's Villa in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

634
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:28,870
(Li Yan's Villa in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

635
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:29,830
once the Shu Army's supply is cut off.
(Li Yan's Villa in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

636
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,420
Li Yan has sent Hu Zhong

637
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,350
to Mount Dingjun

638
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:35,180
to see to the delivery.

639
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:38,660
Our plan is going pretty well.

640
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:41,470
Except for the edict.

641
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:43,060
It's most likely in the study.

642
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:44,460
Destroy it.

643
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,110
Without the edict,

644
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:49,260
Li Yan will be found guilty of treason

645
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:52,060
and West Shu will panic.

646
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,780
Also, there might be a chance

647
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:55,960
to incite Zhuge Liang and his force

648
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,180
to revolt.

649
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:58,830
So,

650
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,020
Li Yan cannot have the edict.

651
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:06,460
His study is under tighter security.

652
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,170
Without Li Yan's written permit,

653
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,430
no one can get in.

654
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,370
Find a way in

655
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,550
and get rid of the edict.

656
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:13,840
That's your job.

657
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:21,120
Got it.

658
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,440
I know once he finds it missing,

659
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,870
and you're still here,

660
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,030
he'll kill you.

661
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:31,020
That's fine.

662
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:43,470
This badge of Siwencao Intelligence

663
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:46,340
is of the highest clearance.

664
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:47,980
Do what you have to do

665
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:49,550
and then leave.

666
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,270
Get out of here

667
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:59,740
and go on with your life.

668
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:26,960
(The Weishui River in Tianshui, the Wei State)

669
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,390
Chen Gong...

670
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,700
Zhulong has been awfully quiet.

671
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,470
Is there something wrong?

672
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,740
I have faith in him.

673
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:54,980
Zhuge Liang

674
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,340
is caught in bad weather.

675
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,940
Sending Wei Yan

676
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,400
to take Xie Valley

677
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:04,930
is a cover

678
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,870
for his real target,

679
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,050
Chencang.

680
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:14,190
It's small but well-fortified,

681
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:16,170
unbreakable from the outside.

682
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:19,710
I've had Hao Zhao hold it from the inside

683
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:20,920
while

684
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:22,670
sending Wang Shuang to support him.

685
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:26,200
But Zhuge Liang never plays by the book.

686
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,110
What if he clamors in the east

687
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,540
and attacks in the west?

688
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:29,710
He won't.

689
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,500
His eyes are fixed on Chencang.

690
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,620
He needs it desperately

691
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,880
as a base

692
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:39,230
for abundant supplies.

693
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:41,830
I'm enlightened.

694
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,350
If he can't get it,

695
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,030
he'll come back

696
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:49,700
to battle us at Mount Qi.

697
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:52,780
All we need is to watch the Weishui River

698
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:54,250
to buy Li Yan enough time

699
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,750
to get things done at his end.

700
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:56,890
It'll only take months

701
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:59,710
before the Shu Army mutinies.

702
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:03,150
Lie low and wait for the right time to act.

703
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,190
I understand.

704
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:17,790
(Zhuge Liang's Tent, the Shu's Camp)

705
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,710
The two sides battled for over 20 days.

706
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,170
Hao Zhao built thick walls inside without coming out

707
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:24,510
and gained reinforcements from the outside days ago.

708
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:25,180
Wang Shuang

709
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:25,790
(Adjutant to Prime Minister of Shu, Liao Hua)
Wang Shuang

710
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:25,950
(Adjutant to Prime Minister of Shu, Liao Hua)

711
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,030
killed Xie Xiong, Gong Qi,
(Adjutant to Prime Minister of Shu, Liao Hua)

712
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:28,650
(Adjutant to Prime Minister of Shu, Liao Hua)

713
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:29,450
and severely injured Zhang Yi on our side.
(Adjutant to Prime Minister of Shu, Liao Hua)

714
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:29,840
(Adjutant to Prime Minister of Shu, Liao Hua)

715
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,750
He's almost invincible.
(Adjutant to Prime Minister of Shu, Liao Hua)

716
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,020
How's Wei Yan at Mount Qi?

717
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,990
He's left Longxi followed by Wei's withdrawal

718
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,220
from Wudu and Yinping.

719
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:44,940
What about Guo Huai?

720
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,590
He and his force have camped

721
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:48,200
(Adjutant to Prime Minister of Shu, Jiang Wan)
He and his force have camped

722
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:48,630
(Adjutant to Prime Minister of Shu, Jiang Wan)

723
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,350
on the north side of the Weishui River.
(Adjutant to Prime Minister of Shu, Jiang Wan)

724
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:52,490
(Adjutant to Prime Minister of Shu, Jiang Wan)

725
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,830
He's certain that I can't take Chencang

726
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,190
and waiting at ease along Mount Qi

727
00:41:58,590 --> 00:41:59,870
for our exhausted troops.

728
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:02,740
We've been trying for days,

729
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,150
but Chencang is unbreakable

730
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:05,750
from both inside and outside.

731
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:06,640
If we continue,

732
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,590
(General of Force of Shu, Deng Zhi)
If we continue,

733
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:08,870
(General of Force of Shu, Deng Zhi)

734
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:10,470
it might hold us back.
(General of Force of Shu, Deng Zhi)

735
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:13,100
Chencang isn't the main target,

736
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,070
but

737
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,070
we can't pull out too quickly.

738
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,820
Just get rid of Wang Shuang

739
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,920
and take the old path out of Mount Qi

740
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,420
to join General Wei's vanguard.

741
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:28,680
That's exactly what Guo Huai wants.

742
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:31,870
He'll ambush us halfway on the river.

743
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:35,260
We'll be walking right into his trap.

744
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:38,220
Now that he's waiting for us,

745
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:41,600
let's see what he's got.

746
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:44,750
The wind will be behind us

747
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,310
when we cross the river.

748
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,880
Equip our boats with the latest repeating crossbows

749
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:50,630
to surprise Guo Huai.

750
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:54,550
Kill Wang Shuang first.

751
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:57,060
General Liao, try to break their defense

752
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,030
and take Chencang.

753
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,690
Wang Shuang isn't an easy target.

754
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:03,070
Don't worry.

755
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,110
I have a plan.

756
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:11,050
(The 24 Strategies of War, The Wind Blows from Longxi)
(Intelligence Agency in Longxi)

757
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:14,120
(The Twenty-first Strategy, Kill with a Borrowed Sword)

758
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,520
Feng Ying

759
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:17,310
got arrested for espionage

760
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,840
by Xun Xu

761
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:21,380
who had Prime Minister's badge.

762
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,710
He must've thought long and hard

763
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:24,170
before taking this step.

764
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:24,850
Take him away.

765
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:27,200
Turns out, the arrest was Feng Ying's plan.

766
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,260
He used his arrest

767
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:30,710
and conviction

768
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:32,820
to make Guo Huai and Li Yan believe

769
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,220
he was on Wei's side

770
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:37,570
to help their spies

771
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,820
infiltrate into Shu,

772
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,780
but actually, he was using Wei

773
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,100
to bring Li Yan down.

774
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,240
He made this plan with Chen Gong and Yang Yi

775
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:49,500
to go along with the Qingping Plan

776
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:52,930
and keep Chen Gong safe as a double agent.

777
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:54,900
As Feng Ying said,

778
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,580
Han's legacy

779
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:58,750
tops life and death.

780
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:00,700
If you ask me,

781
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,080
he's better at

782
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:04,350
killing with a borrowed sword.

783
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:07,030
Now, Chen Gong's got two problems

784
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:08,530
at hand.

785
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:12,040
One, how should he pass Guo Huai's test

786
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,150
by killing Xun Xu?

787
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:16,030
Two, he can't let Xun Xu in

788
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:17,950
on their real plan.

789
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:19,910
What should he do?

790
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:21,750
Meanwhile, your buddy, Xun Xu,

791
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:24,030
is already onto you.

792
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:25,990
It struck him as odd

793
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:27,500
that Feng Ying

794
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,640
got caught so easily.

795
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:30,890
Feng Ying

796
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:33,890
let himself be caught.

797
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:35,340
And he's started

798
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,700
looking into you two's history.

799
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:39,540
What will he do

800
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,430
once he finds out about the past

801
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:42,620
between Chen Gong and Feng Ying?

802
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:43,800
Will Chen Gong

803
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:46,250
be able to kill his sworn brother,

804
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,640
Xun Xu?

805
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:48,420
Will Chen Gong,

806
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:49,670
Yang Yi,

807
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:51,350
and Feng Ying's plan

808
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,380
proceed smoothly?

809
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:54,160
All

810
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:56,670
in my next

811
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:58,140
inside scoop!
