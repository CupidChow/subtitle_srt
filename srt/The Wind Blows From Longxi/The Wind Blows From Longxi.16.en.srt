(The Sixteenth Strategy Stealing on the Sly)

3
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,850
In a day or two, General Li Yan

4
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,550
will go to Chengdu again

5
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,180
to report on the details of Zhulong's Case.

6
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,450
Before he comes back,

7
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,620
go find a good house

8
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,100
in a secluded place.

9
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,710
Looks like

10
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,110
he actually likes Miss Liu.

11
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,460
A prostitute of talent like her

12
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,940
often visits General Li's house

13
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,289
and this would create a bad impression.

14
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:09,759
It's a mere trifle.

15
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,780
I'll satisfy General Li Yan.

16
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,720
You're now in charge of the scribe room.

17
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,170
You can't do a good job

18
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,990
unless you consider everything

19
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,200
before your superior.

20
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,230
I get it, Feng Ying.

21
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,060
Gao Tangbing's case

22
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:30,930
must have been disadvantageous to you, right?

23
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,500
At last, you realized it.

24
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,420
His case is more than disadvantageous.

25
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,880
Can there be future trouble?

26
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,670
A chief in the Intelligence Analysis Department turned out to be a Wei spy.

27
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,420
Think about it.

28
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:47,790
It’s a horrible case for Siwencao Intelligence.

29
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,460
Got it?

30
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,730
I thought about it.

31
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,720
But you're not to blame.

32
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,220
Gao Tangbing kept telling me

33
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,430
that the clerk couldn't be perspicacious about everything,

34
00:02:56,579 --> 00:02:59,410
no matter who he was.

35
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,220
Besides, in Siwencao Intelligence,

36
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,400
Yang Yi used to be your immediate superior.

37
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,860
It can't be your turn to take the blame.

38
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,660
Chief Yang Yi

39
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,300
has been demoted to a plebeian.

40
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,970
If I don't take the blame,

41
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,060
who else will?

42
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,290
For the sake of your relationship with General Li Yan,

43
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,610
he will not stump you.

44
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,410
It's so naive of you.

45
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,390
Relations aren't helpful to us.

46
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,140
Everything is decided by interests.

47
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,150
Your superior will not defend you

48
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,450
or keep you safe

49
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,160
unless you share the same interests with him, got it?

50
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,990
Yes, got it.

51
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,540
Thank you.

52
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:11,210
(Prime Minister’s Mansion in Chengdu, the Shu State)

53
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,770
Prime Minister invited you to a discussion.

54
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:39,730
Come, please.

55
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,870
Don't stand on ceremony, everybody.

56
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,850
Today, you've been invited

57
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,740
for another discussion on the Northern Expedition.

58
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,510
Prime Minister,

59
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,100
I don't agree on the Northern Expedition.

60
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,270
Last night, I observed the sky.

61
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,030
The North was flourishing

62
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,500
and the stars were brilliant.

63
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:16,720
(Qiao Zhou, the Grand Astrologer of Shu)
and the stars were brilliant.

64
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,130
(Qiao Zhou, the Grand Astrologer of Shu)

65
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,100
We shouldn't attack the North.
(Qiao Zhou, the Grand Astrologer of Shu)

66
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,420
(Qiao Zhou, the Grand Astrologer of Shu)

67
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,010
Prime Minister, you're conversant with astronomy.
(Qiao Zhou, the Grand Astrologer of Shu)

68
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,210
Why must you go against it?

69
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,580
Astronomy always changes.

70
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,520
We mustn't be narrow-minded.

71
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,090
I hold the same old view.

72
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,750
Prime Minister, if you start the Northern Expedition again,

73
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,780
I will lead five thousand picked soldiers to start from Baozhong County

74
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,590
and go north along Ziwu Valley in the east of Qinling Mountains.

75
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:40,700
In less than ten days, we'll arrive in Chang'an.

76
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,860
Upon seeing our sudden arrival,

77
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,240
the Wei Army will abandon the city and move towards Dige Town in the west.

78
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,870
Then you can lead a large force there

79
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,810
through Xiegu Valley.

80
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,420
In this way, we will conquer

81
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:52,970
the west of Xianyang.

82
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:55,860
This plan is way too rash.

83
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,970
Wei Yan,

84
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,460
are you mocking the Wei State

85
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,210
for having no talented generals?

86
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,610
If an ingenious Wei army lies in ambush

87
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,420
somewhere secluded on the mountain

88
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,150
and cuts you off,

89
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,240
you can easily break into Ziwu Valley, but hardly leave there.

90
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,390
You'll then lose all your soldiers.

91
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,080
Prime Minister,

92
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,500
I don’t worry about military affairs.

93
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,670
You failed the Northern Expedition last time.

94
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,200
Even though you conquered southern barbarians,

95
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,680
considerable national strength was depleted.

96
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,210
(Jiang Wan, Prime Minister’s Adjutant of Shu)
considerable national strength was depleted.

97
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,580
(Jiang Wan, Prime Minister’s Adjutant of Shu)

98
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,980
I'm afraid fighting wars for years
(Jiang Wan, Prime Minister’s Adjutant of Shu)

99
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:30,170
(Jiang Wan, Prime Minister’s Adjutant of Shu)

100
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:30,920
may not be a good long-term policy for our state.
(Jiang Wan, Prime Minister’s Adjutant of Shu)

101
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,610
may not be a good long-term policy for our state.

102
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,500
Go on.

103
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,630
Since the late emperor passed away,

104
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,430
you've been holding military power and handling national affairs.

105
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:44,409
The present emperor has misgivings about you.

106
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,110
In the court, noble clans

107
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,650
from Jingzhou and Yizhou make things difficult for you.

108
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,180
General Li Yan

109
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,159
strongly advocates the southern campaign against the Wu State

110
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,630
to recover the lost territory of Jingzhou.

111
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,570
His strategic direction is totally opposed.

112
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,430
If you propose the Northern Expedition again,

113
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,300
I'm afraid

114
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,350
you can hardly have a perfect plan.

115
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:30,740
Somebody!

116
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,490
What do you want, sir?

117
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,080
Has Prime Minister ended the discussion?

118
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,240
Not yet. It'll still take a long while.

119
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,790
I hold a different view

120
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,120
from Jiang Wan.

121
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,420
It is time to unite with the Wu State

122
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,460
to fight against the Wei State.

123
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,830
The late emperor occupied Xichuan

124
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,650
and ruled one-third of the whole country,

125
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,220
(Deng Zhi, General of Expedition of Shu)
and ruled one-third of the whole country,

126
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:05,940
(Deng Zhi, General of Expedition of Shu)

127
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,060
relying on strong helpers from all over the country.
(Deng Zhi, General of Expedition of Shu)

128
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,830
relying on strong helpers from all over the country.

129
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,140
So, the prosperity of talents

130
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,260
can be the very foundation of a state.

131
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,300
Now, three states rule the whole country.

132
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,150
Nearly all places are in peace.

133
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,490
But with talents and material resources in Xichuan alone,

134
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:25,050
we aren't strong enough to fight against Wei or Wu for mastery.

135
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:30,190
Our state is like sailing against the current.

136
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,380
If we don't conquer the Central Plains through the Northern Expedition,

137
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:37,429
we'll certainly crumble in three or five years.

138
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,620
What Deng Zhi just said is exactly my point.

139
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:41,330
In this world,

140
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,669
there's no such thing as perfection.

141
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,260
The Wei State is strong and our state is weak.

142
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,420
If things go on like this,

143
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,610
we will decline while they will prosper.

144
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,670
In this way,

145
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,900
our state built by the late emperor

146
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,740
will be annexed by the Wei State sooner or later!

147
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,360
But if we fight them now,

148
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,680
we may stand a chance to win.

149
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,420
The late emperor

150
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,060
visited me three times

151
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,760
and entrusted his son to me.

152
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,350
Even though the future is perilous,

153
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,570
I will not shrink from any sacrifice.

154
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,470
Prime Minister, you have a long-term perspective

155
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,970
and you consider more than us.

156
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,670
A couple of days ago,

157
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,270
I stationed troops in Ji Valley of Mount Qi.

158
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,140
We had more soldiers and weapons

159
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,980
than the Wei Army.

160
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:41,290
Instead of defeating them, we were defeated.

161
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,640
The problem doesn't lie in the number of soldiers

162
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,620
or the national power,

163
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,620
but the commander's decisions.

164
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:53,840
Everybody,

165
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,060
you must learn a lesson from it.

166
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,360
Aye.

167
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,320
(Li Yan's Camp in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

168
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,700
Zhuge Liang will
(Li Yan's Camp in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

169
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,280
(Li Yan's Camp in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

170
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:08,340
propose the Northern Expedition again.
(Li Yan's Camp in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

171
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,130
propose the Northern Expedition again.

172
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,560
I didn't expect him

173
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,480
to be so stubborn.

174
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,960
Zhulong's Case has been cracked.

175
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,990
Maybe Zhuge Liang believes

176
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,410
that there's no future trouble

177
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,740
and we can fight the Wei State

178
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,620
without concern.

179
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,300
General,

180
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,360
what's the attitude of His Majesty?

181
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,080
I can hardly tell.

182
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,520
His Majesty

183
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,010
has something on his mind, too.

184
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,100
Will they make an issue

185
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,700
of Zhulong's Case?

186
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,630
Perhaps.

187
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,290
Feng Ying has a new backer.

188
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,090
They're going to deal with him.

189
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,010
Gao Tangbing is a Wei spy.

190
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,090
Feng Ying

191
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,940
must be culpable.

192
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,360
Shall we defend Feng Ying?

193
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:06,900
Let me think about it.

194
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:09,820
General,

195
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,680
Chen Gong of Siwencao Intelligence asked to see you.

196
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,220
Get him in.

197
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,060
I, Chen Gong, am here.

198
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,440
Greetings, General.

199
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:33,580
You may rise.

200
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:38,270
You're now a hero of our state

201
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,580
who is famous all around the country.

202
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,050
You no longer need to be as courteous as before.

203
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,300
You used to be my teacher

204
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,770
and you're always like my father.

205
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,720
I was so busy working in the Agency

206
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,160
that I didn’t visit you in time.

207
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,590
I feel quite guilty.

208
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,880
Please forgive me.

209
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,170
I know

210
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,610
what happened to you.

211
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,710
I’m sorry for your loss.

212
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,610
Thank you, sir.

213
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:10,750
Come on.

214
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,560
I wondered

215
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,230
why I had never heard from you

216
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,310
since we parted a few years ago.

217
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,200
It turns out

218
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:22,260
that you’ve been working for Siwencao Intelligence.

219
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,960
Sorry, I was so young and arrogant

220
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,030
that I didn't live up to your cultivation.

221
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,260
Be seated.

222
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,540
Come on.

223
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,330
Chen Gong,

224
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,770
you're wrong about it.

225
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,890
Everyone has his own ambition.

226
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,860
If you served as an official,

227
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,130
you may not

228
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,660
be patient enough.

229
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:48,620
Sir,

230
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,420
you can really read my mind.

231
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,700
I'm glad to have you back.

232
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,470
Siwencao Intelligence is short of men.

233
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,900
I'm rather embattled.

234
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,370
If you want me to do anything,

235
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,180
I dare not decline it.

236
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,700
Work in the Agency is complicated.

237
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,780
You must be prepared.

238
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:10,390
Zhulong's Case has been cracked.

239
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:14,180
But Gao Tangbing was a chief of the Intelligence Analysis Department for a long time.

240
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,890
We can't be sure

241
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:20,220
if there were more hidden Wei spies.

242
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,440
Don't worry, sir.

243
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,500
Now that I'm back,

244
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,640
I'll get to the bottom of this case.

245
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:27,860
And I will

246
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,110
let go of no one.

247
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,250
Good. Very good.

248
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,150
I told Feng Ying

249
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,900
that you would take the place of Li Miao.

250
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:38,960
He may not be able to manage it alone.

251
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,580
Thank you, sir.

252
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,160
At the morning court,

253
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:00,720
there will be disputes.

254
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,900
General Li Yan just cracked Zhulong's Case.

255
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,630
He won't easily agree on the Northern Expedition, Prime Minister.

256
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,290
It’s up to His Majesty to make a decision.

257
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,460
This is exactly what worries me.

258
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:16,720
Man proposes, God disposes.

259
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,230
Don't guess too much.

260
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,130
Aye.

261
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,220
What else do you want to say?

262
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,600
Chief Yang Yi was at fault.

263
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:35,010
But he has been industrious for years.

264
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,330
And he’s very loyal to you.

265
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,660
Are you defending him?

266
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:44,750
Yes.

267
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,330
Chief Yang is very capable.

268
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,660
When we fight enemies, it will be idle if we leave him unused.

269
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,010
We'll do it your way.

270
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:58,510
Make him work.

271
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,760
Zhuge Liang wants to hold a morning court

272
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,370
because he will discuss something in front of His Majesty.

273
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,340
Wait until I'm back.

274
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,300
After I'm back,

275
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,150
let's figure out the plan.

276
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,810
Wasn’t the morning court just held?

277
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,460
Why will it be held again so soon?

278
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,550
Zhuge Liang suddenly asked for it,

279
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:33,270
proposing a discussion on the second Northern Expedition.

280
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,550
Chen Gong,

281
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,640
let me quiz you.

282
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,860
The Northern Expedition...

283
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,620
I mean the second Northern Expedition.

284
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,380
What do you think

285
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,840
of it?

286
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,030
If Prime Minister insists on the Northern Expedition,

287
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,180
why don't you

288
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,100
make a concession?

289
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,980
This is a strange thing

290
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,560
to hear.

291
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,860
Don't dream it. Be it.

292
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,590
Now that Prime Minister is so stubborn,

293
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,950
he will bring misery on himself.

294
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:08,910
What makes you think so?

295
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,560
Do you still remember the testamentary edict of the late emperor?

296
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,220
Yes, of course.

297
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,250
The late emperor

298
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,250
said to Zhuge Liang,

299
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:21,310
"You're ten times cleverer than Cao Pi.

300
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,900
Assist my son if you think he's not too bad.

301
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,400
If he's too bad,

302
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,490
take his place."

303
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,280
The late emperor

304
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,850
thought highly

305
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,030
of Zhuge Liang.

306
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,630
He even asked His Majesty

307
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,370
to call Zhuge Liang Godfather.

308
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,310
Zhuge Liang enjoys a glorious life.

309
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,540
"Take his place."

310
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,390
His Majesty has a reason to kill him.

311
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,330
Chen Gong,

312
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,140
you've improved a lot over the years.

313
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,100
You're back right in time.

314
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,750
You'll be my great helper.

315
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,760
Sir,

316
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:04,960
you flatter me.

317
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,060
Off you go.

318
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,099
I'll take my leave, sir.

319
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,589
(Siwencao Intelligence in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

320
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,080
Li Miao used that tea table, didn't he?

321
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,210
Why is it still there?

322
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,180
We asked Clerk Chen about it

323
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,390
and he said it was okay.

324
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,490
No way. Take it away.

325
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,310
Aye.

326
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:39,740
Why bother wiping the screen?

327
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,830
Just move it away.

328
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:42,740
Aye.

329
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,790
You know what?

330
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,380
Not even a single thing that Li Miao used

331
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,020
can be kept in this room.

332
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,230
Be careful, boss.

333
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,760
Xun Xu,

334
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,100
you've come at last.

335
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,620
You were quite patient.

336
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,330
What happened to you?

337
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,770
To catch you,

338
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,440
I had to pay some price.

339
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,060
You were tortured?

340
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,100
It never occurred to me

341
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,070
that you and Baidi

342
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,900
put on a good play.

343
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,850
Good play?

344
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,340
The play was fake,

345
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,860
but we indeed paid the price.

346
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,460
Xun Xu,

347
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,990
I've never thought

348
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,080
about getting you involved.

349
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,780
You reminded Huang Yu,

350
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,880
so that our spy died.

351
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,910
You're guilty!

352
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,630
No spy

353
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,260
can ever control his own life.

354
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:37,760
You just lost a spy.

355
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,340
Do you know who she is?

356
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,830
She's Di Yue.

357
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,870
My cousin

358
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,820
and Baidi's wife.

359
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,800
Xun Xu,

360
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,390
you and I are insiders.

361
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,050
If we didn’t work for different states,

362
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,030
we would still be good buddies.

363
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:13,990
Yeah.

364
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,100
My cousin died a tragic death.

365
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,180
I'm paralyzed from the waist down.

366
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:25,360
It's all because of you, my good buddy!

367
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,360
If you think so,

368
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,000
I have nothing to say.

369
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,330
I'd like to verify something.

370
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:59,420
You told Huang Yu the changing sequence of the night patrol passwords

371
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,610
of the Military Technology Department, right?

372
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:07,510
Yes.

373
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:28,690
Clerk Chen,

374
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,190
your room has been cleaned up.

375
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,140
Everything is replaced.

376
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,220
Before the official appointment is issued,

377
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,540
you'd better not

378
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,450
call me Clerk Chen yet.

379
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,620
Isn't it only a matter of time?

380
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,400
Besides,

381
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,220
if you have nowhere to live

382
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,690
when you're back in Siwencao Intelligence,

383
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,720
it would be ridiculous.

384
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,360
Thank you, Chief Sun.

385
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,190
You're welcome, Clerk Chen.

386
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,420
You deserve it.

387
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,550
I have something to tell Feng Ying.

388
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,940
I'll check my room later.

389
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:00,380
Okay. Do whatever you want.

390
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,380
Don't worry about such problems.

391
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,040
Just take office.

392
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,450
Clerk Feng,

393
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,030
you're my guide in Siwencao Intelligence.

394
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,560
But I'm not capable enough

395
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,220
to be the chief clerk.

396
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,460
General Li Yan told me to take care of you.

397
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:23,890
Besides,

398
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,690
being the Chief Clerk

399
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,540
may only be a transition for you.

400
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:33,600
Clerk Feng,

401
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,310
what does that mean?

402
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:37,490
I don't really understand.

403
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,130
Gao Tangbing turned out to be a spy.

404
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,110
It damaged the foundation of Siwencao Intelligence.

405
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,680
Someone has to take the blame.

406
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,230
But Clerk Feng,

407
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,600
you've been making painstaking efforts and racking your brains

408
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:57,380
for Siwencao Intelligence.

409
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:59,210
In the past dozen years,

410
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,910
you've performed outstanding service.

411
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,670
Even if the court wants to investigate Zhulong's Case,

412
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,560
you will only have to offset your guilt.

413
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,880
I don't think you'll be dismissed.

414
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:08,780
Chen Gong,

415
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,130
you're just back

416
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,220
and you don't understand

417
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,580
how official circles work.

418
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,050
Clerk Feng,

419
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,580
do you misunderstand that I have designs on your post?

420
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,560
No, Chen Gong.

421
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:25,450
It's not that I misunderstand you.

422
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:28,000
I say this just in case.

423
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,220
Anyway,

424
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,060
I made lifelong efforts

425
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,420
on Siwencao Intelligence.

426
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,730
If I no longer work in the Agency,

427
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,050
I want a capable insider

428
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,770
to take my place

429
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:47,810
so that

430
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,030
the intelligence agency of our state

431
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:51,810
will not be ruined completely.

432
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,840
You...

433
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:00,580
You're different from Li Miao.

434
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,530
You can easily understand

435
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,110
the stuff of Siwencao Intelligence.

436
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:14,810
(Chen Gong, the Chief Clerk)

437
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,100
Clerk Feng,

438
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:21,580
if you want me to do anything,

439
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,510
feel free to tell me.

440
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,140
Let me make a long story short.

441
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:30,140
Wuxian Sect was destroyed.

442
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,640
Zhulong was caught.

443
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,890
We shall leave the aftermath work

444
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,330
to the Internal Affairs Department.

445
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,500
However,

446
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,140
we must keep the long-term perspective.

447
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,170
I quite agree.

448
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,600
We shouldn't always let Wei spies

449
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,470
lead us by the nose.

450
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,470
That's exactly my point.

451
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,470
We must strike back.

452
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,680
We must have our own plans.

453
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,310
But before that,

454
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,560
we should make clear our targets.

455
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:56,100
Two targets.

456
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,880
First, against our enemy,

457
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:58,970
the Wei State.

458
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,300
Second, domestic problems.

459
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:02,660
Domestic problems?

460
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,500
Xun Xu,

461
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,740
for your sake,

462
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,430
I'll speak without reserve.

463
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,620
Baidi's code-cracking plates were strictly defended.

464
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,530
How did you get the plates?

465
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,220
From Sun Ling.

466
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:20,820
You know him.

467
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,220
He’s got many faults.

468
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,740
It wasn’t hard

469
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,700
to steal something from him.

470
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,390
Be specific.

471
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,030
Specific?

472
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:37,040
It happened quite a long time ago.

473
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,750
I have to think carefully

474
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,090
about the specific conditions.

475
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,350
About one year ago,

476
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:47,900
Baidi's code-cracking plates

477
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,580
were kept

478
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:51,500
by Sun Ling.

479
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,710
Clerk Feng contacted Baidi

480
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,990
very secretly.

481
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,070
The plates were strictly guarded

482
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,490
by twelve White-feather Warriors

483
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:02,080
every time they were transferred.

484
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:04,180
I couldn't steal them at all.

485
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,700
Sun Ling was my chance.

486
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:10,060
I made the same box as his.

487
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,960
Every time before he traveled,

488
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,030
I exchanged the boxes.

489
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:17,050
Sun Ling never realized it.

490
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,420
At the destination,

491
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,540
I exchanged the boxes again.

492
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,830
By then,

493
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,510
I already got the plates.

494
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,590
The whole process was perfect.

495
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:35,480
Do you have any liaisons?

496
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:39,090
I was a chief in the Intelligence Analysis Department.

497
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,520
It was hard for a spy

498
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:43,390
of the Military Intelligence Agency to have such a high position.

499
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:44,800
I was very cautious.

500
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,990
I always took independent action.

501
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,310
As an insider, you must be aware

502
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,900
that more persons involved

503
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,460
will lead to more danger of exposure, right?

504
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,710
How did you contact the Wei Army?

505
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,390
You're aware of that, too.

506
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,760
I made use of the communication channel

507
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:01,810
of Siwencao Intelligence.

508
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,470
I fabricated a spy named Chidi

509
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,970
who was actually used

510
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,110
to transmit intel for my own state.

511
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,110
It was a loophole

512
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:15,500
in your defense.

513
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,530
When did you know about Gu Zheng?

514
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,500
Didn't you just say

515
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,340
you would speak without reserve?

516
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,290
Tangbing,

517
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,590
am I asking the crucial question?

518
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:39,690
In this industry,

519
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,220
if you don't reply,

520
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,340
you'll suffer.

521
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:45,280
You know it very well.

522
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,920
How about another question?

523
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,040
You know what I can do.

524
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,120
As long as I find a crack,

525
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,310
I'll rip it open soon.

526
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:01,450
Ask another question.

527
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,330
Otherwise,

528
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,220
this is where we have to stop.

529
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:08,940
Fine.

530
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,680
You have a few moments.

531
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,400
Think about it.

532
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,670
Wait.

533
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:31,690
I'll speak, under two conditions.

534
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,100
Go on.

535
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,100
I want the token granted by His Majesty

536
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,830
to absolve me from all my sins.

537
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,300
Then release me

538
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,410
and no longer hunt me down.

539
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:51,140
Xun Xu.

540
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:53,830
Xun Xu!

541
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,870
Prime Minister is convening the morning court again

542
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,460
to discuss the second Northern Expedition.

543
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,340
Siwencao Intelligence

544
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,050
had a false intelligence case before.

545
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,110
We mustn't repeat an error

546
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,830
like Jieting's false intelligence case.

547
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:20,070
I've been doing the fieldwork all year round.

548
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,750
I'm familiar with that.

549
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,470
All right.

550
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,080
I'll have you handle the Operations Department.

551
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,490
I'll let Yin Ji know

552
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,120
that he will be subordinate to you.

553
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,060
In this way,

554
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,510
even if I'm away,

555
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,140
I'll be relieved

556
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,020
when you keep an eye on the fieldwork.

557
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,060
Clerk Chen.

558
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,030
I'm Sun Ling. I ask to see you, Clerk Feng.

559
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:16,760
Come on in.

560
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,030
Feng Ying, it’s me.

561
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,940
Have you arranged everything for him?

562
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,450
Yes.

563
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:33,250
Everything Li Miao used has been replaced.

564
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,190
If he wants you to do anything,

565
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,880
do it conscientiously for him.

566
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,420
Chen Gong isn't like Li Miao.

567
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,040
I will, of course.

568
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:44,690
You instructed Chen Gong personally.

569
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,630
He's one of us.

570
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:54,200
Chen Gong used to be General Li Yan's student.

571
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,980
They're close.

572
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,320
Don't get it wrong.

573
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:03,820
So, Chen Gong isn't on our side?

574
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,270
Don't overthink.

575
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,180
Just do whatever you're asked.

576
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,240
Got it?

577
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,410
Yes, Feng Ying.

578
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:21,880
Sun Ling,

579
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,940
if anything happens to me,

580
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:27,570
I can no longer take care of you.

581
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,580
Remember.

582
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,860
Always be modest.

583
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,040
Feng Ying,

584
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:36,820
have you got any news

585
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:38,510
from Chengdu?

586
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,570
Not yet.

587
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,890
But previous preparations

588
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,510
always lead to success

589
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:50,210
while failure comes without them.

590
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,530
Now that General Li Yan doesn't defend you,

591
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:56,060
why do you still bother looking for a good house

592
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,400
for him?

593
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,820
Such a big favor will be wasted.

594
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,480
It's even less beneficial than raising a dog.

595
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,020
Nonsense!

596
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,750
But Feng Ying,

597
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,110
this is the truth I'm telling.

598
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:10,940
I'm not looking for a house

599
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,000
to defend my job,

600
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:15,120
but to keep myself alive!

601
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:54,460
(Ziyan House)

602
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,550
Sir, which girl would you like to see?

603
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,230
There's a Miss Liu Ying here, right?

604
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,660
Yes, there is.

605
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,340
But Miss Liu is the best girl here.

606
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:07,000
Is the money enough?

607
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,870
I'm Ying'er, Miss Liu's maid.

608
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:17,290
Come this way, please.

609
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:17,960
All right.

610
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,620
Nice to meet you, Mister Chen.

611
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,210
I wonder what you like.

612
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,310
What can you do?

613
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:38,030
I can play some musical instruments.

614
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:41,890
If you don’t like that,

615
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,640
I can also sing a song for you

616
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,210
to relieve your boredom.

617
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,800
I'm a bit of a boor and not interested in that.

618
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,890
I guess it's your first time to visit us

619
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,320
and you don't know the rules.

620
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,040
In this place,

621
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,530
we offer all kinds of entertainment.

622
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,310
You just need to be patient.

623
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,460
Though the tortoise lives long, it dies anyway.

624
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:22,489
The serpent flies,

625
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:24,300
as if traveling in the universe.

626
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,110
At last, you've come.

627
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:48,030
(Regional Inspector's Mansion in Yongzhou, the Wei State)

628
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:51,500
(Guo Huai, the Regional Inspector of Yongzhou, the Wei State)

629
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,219
This year, Tianshui has a good harvest.
(Guo Huai, the Regional Inspector of Yongzhou, the Wei State)

630
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:53,440
(Guo Huai, the Regional Inspector of Yongzhou, the Wei State)

631
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,710
Even if the Shu Army attacks us,
(Guo Huai, the Regional Inspector of Yongzhou, the Wei State)

632
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:56,780
the grain will be enough for half a year.

633
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:01,060
The defense of Chencang County has been basically completed.

634
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,130
A 3,000-soldier vanguard has arrived.

635
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:05,760
Another 2,000 soldiers are on their way.

636
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,490
They'll be arriving in two days.

637
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,300
I'm Guo Gang who's guilty. Greetings, Inspector Guo.

638
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,710
Let's call it a day.

639
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,530
You may leave for some rest.

640
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,610
Aye.

641
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:23,150
Thank you, Inspector Guo.

642
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:31,290
Guo Gang,

643
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,620
I've been too busy

644
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,680
to care about you lately.

645
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,550
Uncle,

646
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,930
I swear I didn't know that Chen Gong was Baidi.

647
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:45,270
I also didn't know that Chen Gong was still alive.

648
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,270
I'm sorry.

649
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:47,950
All right. Be seated first.

650
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:54,560
You did something so reckless.

651
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,100
But I wasn't surprised at all.

652
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,630
It doesn't matter.

653
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,700
Young men can make mistakes.

654
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:02,670
You should learn a lesson from it.

655
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,630
All right.

656
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,880
Go get packed

657
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,480
and return to Tianshui.

658
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:19,330
I...

659
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,660
I haven't atoned for my mistake yet.

660
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:24,090
How could I resume my post?

661
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:27,680
Qingping Plan is in its last stage.

662
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,980
Did we get the design of the crossbow?

663
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,900
The real secret of Qingping Plan

664
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,700
doesn't aim to steal crossbow techniques,

665
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,820
but to plant our spy

666
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,620
to the highest management level.

667
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:48,980
Think about it.

668
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,700
If Zhulong

669
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,430
can serve as a chief

670
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,780
in Siwencao Intelligence,

671
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,030
then,

672
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,240
we will lose no time in getting

673
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:00,420
all the important military intel of Shu.

674
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:04,230
This is how we can win wars.

675
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,340
I still don't understand, Uncle.

676
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,100
Gao Tangbing

677
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:11,500
has been caught, hasn't he?

678
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,020
Zhulong is only a code name.

679
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:16,140
When Gao Tangbing was exposed,

680
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,080
he was no longer Zhulong.

681
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:22,510
Instead, he would cover Zhulong.

682
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,160
Then, who is

683
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,350
the new Zhulong?

684
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,460
Play chess with me first.

685
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:56,290
(Chengdu, the Shu State)

686
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,670
(The Royal Palace)

687
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:05,980
Greetings, sir.

688
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,330
Greetings, Prime Minister.

689
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,480
Prime Minister, after my father passed away,

690
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:00,580
you went to the barren Lu River personally.

691
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:03,280
After seven rounds of clashes, you conquered southern barbarians.

692
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:05,450
You made unparalleled contributions.

693
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:09,070
Now, neither the Wei nor Wu State

694
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:11,410
wants to invade us.

695
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:13,540
It's settled that three states rule the country.

696
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,460
Prime Minister, why don't you just enjoy the peace?

697
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,690
Why are you proposing the Northern Expedition again?

698
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,730
Your Majesty,

699
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,220
three states don't consort and we can't be satisfied with the sovereignty over a part of the country.

700
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:25,210
Therefore,

701
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:29,010
I propose to take the risk as the late emperor wished.

702
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:32,710
Besieged with Wu and our state,

703
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,900
the Wei Army is rather fatigued.

704
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:37,140
It's time to make an attack.

705
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:40,250
Prime Minister, if you're truly familiar with warcraft,

706
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:44,090
why did you fail in Jieting?

707
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,250
Cao Cao failed to defeat Chang Ba five times

708
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:48,720
and cross Chaohu Lake four times.

709
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:51,250
He designated Li Fu, but Li Fu betrayed him.

710
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:53,340
He then appointed Xiahou, but Xiahou was defeated and killed.

711
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:57,330
Every time the late emperor spoke of Cao Cao,

712
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,840
he praised him for commanding troops amazingly.

713
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:04,620
Wars are complicated. No one can always win.

714
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:05,940
If you say so,

715
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:08,430
we can fight the Wu State

716
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:09,810
before the Wei State.

717
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:15,000
Why must you insist on fighting the Wei State together with Wu?

718
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:19,250
Besides, the late emperor was killed by the Wu Army.

719
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:21,700
But you don't plan to take revenge

720
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:22,770
or resume Jingzhou!

721
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:26,330
How can you live up to the late emperor in heaven?

722
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:30,020
Weak forces work together to fight a strong army.

723
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,250
It's what people do through the ages.

724
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:35,450
Sun Quan has owned the Wu State through three generations.

725
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,320
His state has difficult terrain and people support him.

726
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,540
Wise and virtuous officials work for him.

727
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,170
We can ask him for help, instead of fighting him.

728
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,050
What's worse,

729
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,980
I don't have a perfect plan for the expedition against Wu.

730
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:50,150
The late emperor was capable enough. With millions of soldiers,

731
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:52,620
he was still defeated by Lu Xun of Wu.

732
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:56,130
If we break with the Wu State,

733
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:59,580
the Wei Army will seize the chance and fight us.

734
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,260
In this way,

735
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:02,930
Your Majesty,

736
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:07,690
you will lose the Hanzhong Region.

737
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:11,790
Your Majesty,

738
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:15,360
I've been in the Hanzhong Region for only a few years.

739
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,060
During that, I lost more than 70 generals

740
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,340
including Yang Qun, Ma Yu,

741
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:24,150
Yan Zhi, Ding Li,

742
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:27,130
Bai Shou, Liu He, and Deng Tong.

743
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,980
I lost more than a thousand soldiers

744
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:31,690
like commandos, elite soldiers, and cavalrymen.

745
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:33,860
They were elite soldiers

746
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,200
that had been gathered from different places over decades.

747
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:37,140
They didn't only come from our state.

748
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:41,520
In a few years,

749
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,500
we will lose two-thirds of our troops.

750
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,460
If we don't start a war against Wei now,

751
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:48,170
our state

752
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:50,800
will have

753
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:54,560
no more advantage to fight our enemies!

754
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,570
You made sense, Godfather.

755
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,610
(Intelligence Agency in Longxi)
(The 24 Strategies of War, The Wind Blows from Longxi)

756
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:15,950
(The Sixteenth Strategy Stealing on the Sly)

757
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,890
Absolutely typical.

758
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,900
As Li Yan expected,

759
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:24,450
Chen Gong paid a visit to him.

760
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:26,230
After all, Chen Gong's father

761
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,660
used to work for Li Yan.

762
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,140
Li Yan has enough trust in Chen Gong.

763
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:33,800
He made Chen Gong the Clerk

764
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,900
and asked him to find out the remaining Wei spies

765
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:38,900
in Siwencao Intelligence.

766
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,520
It was superficial of me.

767
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:42,860
I thought the case would be at an end

768
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:44,850
after Gao Tangbing fell from power.

769
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,510
Unexpectedly, Regional Inspector Guo Huai of Wei

770
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:48,900
held back another trick.

771
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:51,820
Chen Gong visited Miss Liu Ying

772
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,350
and exchanged code words with her.

773
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,190
Guo Gang has also been kept in the dark

774
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:57,120
even though he resumed his post.

775
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:58,040
This is indeed

776
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:59,820
a clever move.

777
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:01,280
Xun Xu is quite impatient.

778
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:03,800
Before he fully recovered, he interrogated Gao Tangbing.

779
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:05,690
Don't get angry, Xun Xu.

780
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,800
Come on, Gao Tangbing.

781
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:09,220
We used to be colleagues, after all.

782
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:10,780
Tell me about it.

783
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,080
What faults do I have?

784
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:13,750
Oh, boy.

785
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:15,460
So, you replaced Baidi's code-cracking plates

786
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,820
when I wasn't noticing.

787
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:20,460
This is so uncool that you did this!

788
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:21,350
Besides,

789
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:22,530
how did you have the cheek

790
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,090
to point out the loophole in our defense?

791
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:26,340
Before you confess everything,

792
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:28,620
just stay in jail!

793
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,510
When did Gao Tangbing

794
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:32,550
know about Gu Zheng?

795
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:35,900
Judging from Guo Huai's conversation with Guo Gang,

796
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,400
there are new plots.

797
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:39,820
Chen Gong's role is getting more complicated.

798
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:42,140
Not only Li Yan thinks highly of him,

799
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,770
but Feng Ying also

800
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,240
wants him to take charge of Siwencao Intelligence.

801
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:49,020
What is he

802
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,480
going to do next?
