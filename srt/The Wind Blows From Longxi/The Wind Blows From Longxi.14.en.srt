3
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,410
Chief Gao,

4
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,250
on patrol again?

5
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,220
The weather is quite bad today.

6
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,580
Jobs in Siwencao Intelligence are tough.

7
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,380
However,

8
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,500
as I'm paid,

9
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,620
I have to work.

10
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:52,860
You make sense.

11
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,620
Let them pass.

12
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:03,860
Here, Mister Mi.

13
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,100
Thank you.

14
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,960
Elder Qin had an accident that day.

15
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,900
What exactly happened?

16
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:18,620
I'm ashamed to say that.

17
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:19,500
Actually,

18
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,140
I don't know very much

19
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,570
about Bamboo Kites.

20
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,660
I guess after Elder Qin jumped off the cliff,

21
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,579
he panicked so much

22
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,700
that he pulled the control ropes frequently

23
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,660
and made

24
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,780
the wings loosened.

25
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:33,820
In the end,

26
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,820
the accident happened.

27
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:44,970
Elder Guan,

28
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,980
this is the last Bamboo Kite we have.

29
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:49,860
So, on our way,

30
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,420
we must be very careful.

31
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:53,890
Got it.

32
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,380
This is the last key part of Qingping Plan.

33
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,940
I'll keep an eye on it personally.

34
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,740
We're on the mountain across the valley.

35
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,490
We won't take action until seven.

36
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,700
Mister Mi, take a rest first.

37
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,790
(Internal Affairs Department in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

38
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,900

00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:16,850
unless you have to.

40
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,540
Got it.

41
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:19,890
Your uniform is left

42
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,100
just in case.

43
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,860
Normally, nobody checks the shift.

44
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,260
If anyone comes in,

45
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,300
find an excuse

46
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,380
and cover me up.

47
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,620
Don't worry, Chief Xun.

48
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:30,920
I'll take care of everything here.

49
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,770
If I die in this mission,

50
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,020
I'll leave my house

51
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,500
to you.

52
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,560
Chief Xun,

53
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,460
you'll be all right.

54
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,450
Don't overthink.

55
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:42,980
Why are you leaving the town?

56
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,300
I'm Xun Xu from the Internal Affairs Department.

57
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,260
I'm leaving the town for something urgent.

58

(Shu's Granary on Mount Dingjun, the Shu State)

60
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,260
Chief Gao,

61
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:08,580
these army provisions

62
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,210
will be sent to the battlefield in Wudu.

63
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,430
Early tomorrow morning.

64
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,580
Who's the escort?

65
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,930
Commandant Cheng Fan.

66
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:20,700
An acquaintance of mine.

67
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:21,980
When I have time tomorrow,

68
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,020
I'll visit him.

69
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,190
These army provisions

70
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,330
will be registered by convention.

71
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,810
Tonight,

72
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,380
I'll send the register to your room.

73
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,060
This is the important granary.

74
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,630
Nothing can go wrong.

75
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,540
Thank you for your hard work.

76
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,450
Actually,

77
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,659
life has been easy enough for us.

78
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,100
Once the Northern Expedition starts,

79
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,380
we'll be busy.

80
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,650
Yeah.

81
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,520
Here is the transport center of the Hanzhong region.

82
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,780
As the garrison,

83
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,500
you bear heavy responsibilities.

84
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:55,820
Aye.

85
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,420
Chief Gao.

86
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,180
Tonight,

87
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,660
General Ma Dai will give a banquet

88
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,140

You represent Siwencao Intelligence.

93
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,490
You're here on behalf of Clerk Feng.

94
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,890
We must be hospitable.

95
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,240
All right.

96
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,020
Come, please.

(Shu's second checkpoint on Mount Dingjun, the Shu State)

102
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,140
I've got urgent military intel to tell Commandant Qiao Jun.

103
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,220
Commandant Qiao Jun is in the head office.

104
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,539
I'll have someone lead the way for you.

105
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,240
Don't bother. I've been here before.

106
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,480
You traveled all the way here in the darkness.

107
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,980
Your work is quite tiring.

108
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,880
We're used to that.

109
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:53,920
Let him pass.

110
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,040
Thank you.

111
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,220
Close the gate.

112

(The head office on Mount Dingjun, the Shu State)

113
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,380
We need help

114
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,180
from the outside

115
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,820
to unlock the back door in the head office

116
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,540
so that

117
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,820
Chen Gong can get out.

118
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:18,210
(Before Shu's third checkpoint on Mount Dingjun, the Shu State)

119
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,120
This is the top of the mountain across the valley.

120
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,180
At the foot of that mountain,

121
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,320
the Shu General Huang Zhong

122
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,420
killed Xiahou Yuan many years ago.

123
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:14,980
Look over there.

124
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,300
That is

125
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,630
the second checkpoint of the Military Technology Department.

126
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,860
We don't stand a chance to break in directly.

127
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,380
So, by then,

128
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,170
you'll lead Elder Guan and Eighteen Arhats

129
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,860
to climb down the cliff

130
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:34,420
across the Military Technology Department.

131
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,220
At a quarter to ten,

132
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,820
I'll take the masses of the Sect

133
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,340
to the western bottom of the valley

134
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,780
and attack their warehouse.

135
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,150
In the warehouse,

136
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,060
there are

137
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,690
various materials for crossbows.

138
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,090
Once the warehouse is on fire,

139
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,310
the Shu Army will come and put out the fire.

140
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,420
By then, the head office will be weakly defended.

141
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,580
It'll be the right time.

142
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:58,580
Got it.

143
00:12:59,050 --> 00:12:59,820
The fire in the warehouse

144
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,220
will be the signal for my action.

145
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,620
When you get the designs,

146
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,930
Elder Guan will cover your retreat.

147
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,200
You can jump off the cliff from the east

148
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,500
with the Bamboo Kite.

149
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,340
Once the warehouse is on fire,

150
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,380
I'll evacuate with my elite troops.

151
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,460
We will

152
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,100
reach the east of the valley

153
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,570
and coordinate with you.

154
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,270
All is well prepared

155
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,390
and everything is ready.

156
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,240
Have you remembered

157
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,120
Zhulong's password?

158
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,870
I've kept it firmly in my heart.

159
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,660
This is

160
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,700
the key to the warehouse where the designs are kept.

161
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:55,900
Mister Mi!

162
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,180
Mister Mi!

163
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,140
Mister Mi.

164
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,620
Shall we break in, Mister Mi?

165
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,420
Not until Leader Huang sends a signal.

166
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:19,980
Fire! Fire!

167
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,810
The warehouse is on fire!

168
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,110
Let's go for rescue!

169
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,670
The warehouse is on fire!

170
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:30,880
Let's go for rescue!

171
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,080
Fire! Fire!

172
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,160
Hurry.

173
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:02,650
Let's break in.

174
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,440
Action.

175
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,020
Go.

176
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,500
Wait a minute.

177
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:29,500
Password.

178
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,500
Thrilling water.

179
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,020
The door is too heavy. Come and help me.

180
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:23,230
Password.

181
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,510
Thrilling water!

182
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:31,480
Hurry.

183
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:32,790
Lie in ambush.

184
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:22,400
Here they are.

185
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:25,780
Come on.

186
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:32,460
The designs of Yuanrong and Shudu are here.

187
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:39,250
Go without me.

188
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:39,880
Aye.

189
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,000
The enemies are coming!

190
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,560
Kill the Shu enemies!

191
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,090
I guess this is where

192
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,340
Leader Huang wants us to jump.

193
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,610
Mister Mi, I'll cover you.

194
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,040
Leave with the Bamboo Kite first.

195
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,850
What's the thrill with breath?

196
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,780
What's the fear of death?

197
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,590
Come on, Chief Gao.

198
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,360
Let me fill your cup.

199
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,520
I'm a mere chief

200
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,540
from Siwencao Intelligence.

201
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,080
You flatter me, General Ma Dai.

202
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:03,170
Don't be modest, Chief Gao.

203
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,540
This is not only a toast to you,

204
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,370
but also to Clerk Feng

205
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,770
and Siwencao Intelligence.

206
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,930
Your wish is my command, then.

207
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,300
Chief Gao,

208
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,220
what do you think

209
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,690
of the conference in Chengdu?

210
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,250
Chengdu is far away from here.

211
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:34,390
I live in Nanzheng County, the Hanzhong region.

212
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,560
Though Siwencao Intelligence is in the Hanzhong region,

213
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,180
it's the center of information.

214
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,820
You must be well-informed.

215
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,090
When Chief Yang has lost his position,

216
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,190
Prime Minister Zhuge is like losing a capable assistant.

217
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,820
I guess things in Chengdu

218
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,120
will be different from before.

219
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,590
I'm a soldier.

220
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:00,650
I never care about the fight for power.

221
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:03,660
I'm simply sticking to the issue.

222
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,380
I don't dare to gossip about politics.

223
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,430
Cheers.

224
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,410
Cheers.

225
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,460
An urgent report!

226
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:15,500
Make way!

227
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:17,290
Report!

228
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:19,490
General,

229
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:21,300
large enemy forces are attacking the head office of the Military Technology Department.

230
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:22,820
Commandant Qiao Jun is seeking help.

231
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,180
Why are there large enemy forces

232
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,860
in the interior of the Hanzhong region?

233
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,870
We're not sure about the details.

234
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:33,570
This is the important granary.

235
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,010
Without an edict or commander's seal,

236
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:38,460
not even a single soldier can be transferred.

237
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,250
This is the law of the court.

238
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,700
I guess

239
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:47,260
those who are attacking the head office

240
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,850
are elite troops of Wuxian Sect.

241
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,930
They were titled by the Wei State

242
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,760
and now they're working on Qingping Plan

243
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,910
to steal our crossbow techniques.

244
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:59,610
This is our important granary.

245
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,340
If Wuxian Sect is aiming at us,

246
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,470
we'll be tricked by transferring our soldiers away.

247
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,620
But crossbow techniques are

248
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,540
also secret strategic advantages of our army.

249
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:09,540
Once they're stolen, there'll be endless trouble.

250
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,580
Hope you'll make a wise decision, General.

251
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,950
Commandant Qiao Jun

252
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,050
has asked for help.

253
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:21,890
It means

254
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,500
they're at a critical moment.

255
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:27,830
Our army can't leave the encampment without permission.

256
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,000
Chief Gao.

257
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:37,720
Luckily, you are here.

258
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,400
I have 200 swordsmen.

259
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,870
Take them to help the Military Technology Department

260
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,660
and suppress the enemies.

261
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:46,610
Aye, General.

262
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:52,520
(The head office on Mount Dingjun, the Shu State)

263
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:07,390
Xun Xu.

264
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:14,690
Did you see Commandant Qiao Jun?

265
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:15,800
Yes.

266
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:16,720
What did you tell him?

267
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,400
A top secret of Siwencao Intelligence.

268
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,400
No one can know about it, but Commandant Qiao Jun.

269
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:22,770
What's the password for tonight?

270
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,060
Chief Xun,

271
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,400
please get off the horse.

272
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:40,390
Clerk Feng knew I was acquainted with Commandant Qiao Jun,

273
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:41,920
so he sent me.

274
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:43,860
He only gave me the entry and exit permit.

275
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,810
He didn't mention a password.

276
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,210
Things have changed.

277
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,080
Under the command of Commandant Qiao Jun,

278
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,990
ten kilometers around Mount Dingjun is blockaded.

279
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,280
No one shall get in or out, no matter what reason he has.

280
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:55,750
Here is the thing.

281
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:56,990
Tonight,

282
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,500
I must return to Nanzheng County

283
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,890
for some urgent business.

284
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:00,990
Chief Xun,

285
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,300
you can't leave.

286
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,930
Please wait. Commandant Qiao Jun will come and check.

287
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:09,570
Clerk Feng asked me to return in a limited time.

288
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,130
If the military affair is delayed,

289
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,580
you must be responsible.

290
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,060
Sorry.

291
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,760
Siwencao Intelligence and our army aren't subordinate to each other.

292
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,680
I only take orders from my superior.

293
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,960
Sorry for the offense, Chief Xun.

294
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:33,150
(Ziyan House in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

295
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:42,340
Clerk Feng,

296
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,920
when I see General Li Yan,

297
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,590
what should I say?

298
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,680
In front of General Li Yan,

299
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:55,900
don't be so close to me.

300
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,000
I know.

301
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,090
I haven't seen him yet.

302
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,690
Just be honest.

303
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,850
Answer honestly when he asks questions.

304
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,530
But I'm scared.

305
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,740
General Li Yan enjoys high prestige.

306
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:17,480
Don't be scared.

307
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,120
I'll be there for you.

308
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,930
Do you remember what I told you?

309
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,150
What?

310
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:26,760
I can't remember anything.

311
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:34,430
Got it.

312
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,550
I'll listen to you, Clerk Feng.

313
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:44,790
(The head office on Mount Dingjun, the Shu State)

314
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:46,890
Commandant Qiao Jun.

315
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:50,250
Chief Xun,

316
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,340
I was told that you saw me tonight.

317
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,250
I was ordered to see you.

318
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:55,510
But I was late.

319
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:56,940
Wuxian Sect took action before I arrived.

320
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,550
Clerk Feng sent you?

321
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,720
Of course.

322
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:02,570
My department is in charge of the intel about Wuxian Sect.

323
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,010
But we still can't leave the town

324
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,760
without Clerk Feng's permission.

325
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:09,680
Here's the permit.

326
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,060
Why did my men tell me

327
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,630
that you were on your way back after meeting me?

328
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:19,930
I saw Wuxian Sect take action

329
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,400
and I failed to find you.

330
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,760
I wanted to go back and report it to Clerk Feng.

331
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:24,650
Maybe

332
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,080
under such an urgent situation,

333
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,220
they misheard it.

334
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:29,970
Didn't Clerk Feng tell you the password?

335
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:34,890
No, he didn't.

336
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,660
Clerk Feng knew we were acquainted with each other.

337
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,340
With the entry and exit permit,

338
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:41,690
he thought everything would be okay.

339
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:42,740
Wrong.

340
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:45,380
Clerk Feng verified

341
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,770
the passwords for our department.

342
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:48,440
And I remember

343
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,820
it's you who advised it.

344
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:50,980
Yeah.

345
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:53,020
When you went to Siwencao Intelligence,

346
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,530
we discussed

347
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,590
this defense proposal.

348
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,440
I'm afraid Clerk Feng was too busy

349
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,200
to tell me about it.

350
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,420
This is a very serious problem!

351
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,020
The designs of Shudu and Yuanrong have been stolen.

352
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,660
Chief Xun,

353
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,060
I must verify your mission with Clerk Feng.

354
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,420
Stay here

355
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:12,820
and don't go anywhere else.

356
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:20,760
Be polite to him.

357
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,440
But never let him leave!

358
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,270
Aye.

359
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,000
You two, go immediately.

360
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:25,700
Come over.

361
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:28,610
Go to Nanzheng County and verify Xun Xu's mission.

362
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,020
If he was indeed sent by Feng Ying,

363
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:32,800
let him leave politely.

364
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:33,520
Aye.

365
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,460
What did you say?

366
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:56,170
Xun Xu of the Internal Affairs Department

367
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:57,530
said Clerk Feng sent him

368
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:00,480
to report a secret to Commandant Qiao Jun of the Military Technology Department?

369
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,070
I didn't hear about it at all.

370
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:13,240
This mission isn't recorded in Siwencao Intelligence.

371
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,200
Are you sure it's Xun Xu?

372
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,360
Did you get it wrong?

373
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,590
His identity was verified.

374
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:19,000
Commandant Qiao Jun knew him.

375
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:19,950
It's Chief Xun.

376
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,720
But Xun Xu is supposed to be on duty today.

377
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:29,620
Why did he show up on Mount Dingjun?

378
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,440
Chief Sun, please confirm it.

379
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,140
Xun Xu.

380
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,240
Xun Xu!

381
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:51,510
Oh, Chief Sun.

382
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,160
Why is it you?

383
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:55,600
Where's Xun Xu?

384
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,680
Chief Xun didn't feel well just now

385
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,590
and he went back home.

386
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,580
I'm on duty for him.

387
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,480
Just now?

388
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:04,380
When exactly?

389
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:05,380
About...

390
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,040
One hour ago.

391
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:10,970
That's weird.

392
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,170
How could he get to Mount Dingjun

393
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,980
in only one hour?

394
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,550
Can Xun Xu

395
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,070
do traveling tricks of Wuxian Sect?

396
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,570
Mount Dingjun?

397
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,370
How's that possible?

398
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:25,650
Pei Xu,

399
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,690
why are you in Xun Xu's uniform?

400
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,450
Chief Sun,

401
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,660
this is an emergency. I ask to see Clerk Feng.

402
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,730
We can't reach Clerk Feng now.

403
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,220
I'll go to Mount Dingjun with you.

404
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,800
Somebody!

405
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:43,730
Yes.

406
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,170
Take Pei Xu down.

407
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,020
Don't punish him until I'm back!

408
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:48,880
Aye.

409
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:58,690
Take him down.

410
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:05,840
(Li Yan's Camp in Nanzheng County, the Shu State)

411
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,090
I don't do very well in music.

412
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,030
Please do not laugh at my performance.

413
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,210
I...

414
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,830
I don't know about music.

415
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,600
But when listened to it,

416
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:12,370
I felt quite sad.

417
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,600
In 218 A.D.,

418
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,480
the late emperor conquered the Hanzhong region

419
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:24,380
and confronted Xiahou Yuan of Wei at Yangping Pass.

420
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,100
Cao Cao

421
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,020
garrisoned Chang'an

422
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,450
and guided the war in the Hanzhong region.

423
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:35,060
Back then, I was only the magistrate of Zizhong County.

424
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:38,710
Unexpectedly, Ma Qin and Gao Sheng rose with tens of thousands of soldiers.

425
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,020
Instigated by the Wei Army,

426
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:43,440
they rebelled.

427
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,440
Only four thousand soldiers were

428
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,060
defending the county.

429
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:52,730
I fought the enemies for several days.

430
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:54,410
Outside of the county,

431
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:57,080
a lot of people died.

432
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:06,250
Miss Liu, when I listened to your music,

433
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,719
I felt

434
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:10,570
as if I saw that war again.

435
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:14,600
General,

436
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:17,360
I didn't know you were also in such a dangerous situation.

437
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,850
Do you think

438
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:22,250
I'm a general

439
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:24,370
in the name only?

440
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,130
I don't dare to think so.

441
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:29,810
Come on. Be seated.

442
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,480
Miss Liu is here.

443
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,610
When she saw you behave like this,

444
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,580
she would think

445
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,330
I was a devil.

446
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,170
General,

447
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,170
with great civil and military skills,

448
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,159
you're indeed a genius of our state.

449
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:47,260
Clerk Feng,

450
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:49,130
thank you for recommending Miss Liu.

451
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:07,080
The moment I saw you,

452
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,730
I felt you were my soul mate.

453
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,040
General, thank you for the wine.

454
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,240
Miss Liu, why don't you stay here

455
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,850
so that you can talk about histories

456
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:23,320
and learn from each other

457
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:24,640
with General?

458
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,970
You'll leave a romantic story in history.

459
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:33,170
I'd love to.

460
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:35,130
However,

461
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:38,250
I wonder if General wants me to stay.

462
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,950
I indeed want it.

463
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:46,810
I indeed want it.

464
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:23,300
We searched more than ten kilometers in the canyon

465
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,040
but haven't found Mister Mi yet.

466
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,450
However...

467
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,320
Under the cliff,

468
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,210
we found Elder Guan's body.

469
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,750
Elder Guan?

470
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,090
If we keep waiting here,

471
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,890
when the Shu Armies encircle us together,

472
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:42,770
we won't escape.

473
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:45,610
Leader Huang, didn't you and Mister Mi

474
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:47,570
have two proposals?

475
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:48,610
Yeah.

476
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:49,960
If Mister Mi loses contact,

477
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,360
he'll go to the specified destination alone

478
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:54,720
and give the designs to Zhulong.

479
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:03,180
Are you saying

480
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:05,290
that I misjudged?

481
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,580
Report.

482
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,480
The Shu Army is approaching.

483
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,430
The path to Xixiang Town is cut, too.

484
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,040
We can't make it to Gujian Xikou.

485
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,290
Leader,

486
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:23,560
we shall no longer stay here.

487
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,000
Fine.

488
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,040
Forget it.

489
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,050
Let's go to Tianshui.

490
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:37,490
All right.

491
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:38,460
Go.

492
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:39,810
-Fall back.
-Everybody, let's go.

493
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:49,280
(Military Technology Department on Mount Dingjun, the Shu State)

494
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,480
General,

495
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:55,410
those who were captured alive confessed

496
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,520
that all elite members of Wuxian Sect

497
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,890
attacked our head office.

498
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,210
They fired our warehouse

499
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,290
to cover their masters

500
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:03,970
when they sneaked into our head office for the designs.

501
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:08,890
What on earth did Xun Xu do?

502
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,360
Chief Sun Ling from Siwencao Intelligence has arrived.

503
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:13,720
Let's go and interrogate him.

504
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:26,690
Chief Sun,

505
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:29,450
what has he confessed?

506
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:32,280
He hasn't confessed anything yet.

507
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,220
Have you verified it with Clerk Feng?

508
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,010
Clerk Feng was away last night

509
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,400
for a secret mission.

510
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:39,260
We couldn't ask him for confirmation yet.

511
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:42,090
However, Clerk Feng wouldn't send him

512
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:44,930
to report anything to you.

513
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:48,010
I'm the chief of the scribe room.

514
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:50,410
I'll take the responsibility.

515
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:53,850
Besides, Chief Xun

516
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,090
asked his henchman

517
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,210
to be on duty for him,

518
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:00,080
trying to muddle through!

519
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:03,410
Chief Xun,

520
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:06,710
you and I are kind of acquaintances.

521
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,440
Can you tell me what you were up to?

522
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,200
I want some water.

523
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:46,650
To be honest,

524
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:49,110
the designs of Shudu and Yuanrong were stolen.

525
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:52,000
Now you decide

526
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,610
whether I can live.

527
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:56,290
If I can't get the designs back in time,

528
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,050
I'll be executed for sure.

529
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:01,280
Commandant Qiao Jun,

530
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,440
I guarantee you with my life

531
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:08,160
that neither Wuxian Sect nor Wei spies

532
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:09,850
have the designs.

533
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:12,680
They'll be returned in good condition.

534
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:14,090
Then could you explain

535
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:15,130
what exactly happened?

536
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,480
Sorry,

537
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,530
but I can't tell you

538
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:23,560
the truth yet.

539
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,960
You're suspected to have helped Wuxian Sect

540
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,780
sneak into the restricted area of the Military Technology Department!

541
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,650
Why are you still keeping it from us?

542
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:41,800
Well,

543
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:44,280
I totally agree with your judgment.

544
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,700
But you have to leave him to me.

545
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,840
I'll take him back to Siwencao Intelligence for interrogation!

546
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:49,290
Go.

547
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:50,370
Why do you still want to take him back?

548
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:51,250
Look what he has done!

549
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,240
Unless he explains something,

550
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,410
he'll be crumbled!

551
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:56,890
Chief Xun,

552
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:58,680
think carefully about it.

553
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,330
Leave.

554
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:01,170
Leave.

555
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:02,440
Go.

556
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,840
He's one of our men!

557
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:05,280
You have no right to torture him!

558
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,100
Go.

559
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:07,580
You're way out of line!

560
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:20,730
If anything unexpected happens

561
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:21,840
and we can't meet,

562
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,810
send the designs

563
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:28,130
to the camphor tree at Gujian Xikou.

564
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,760
Zhulong will be waiting for you there.

565
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:15,630
(Intelligence Agency in Longxi)
(The 24 Strategies of War, The Wind Blows from Longxi)

566
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,350
(The Fourteenth Strategy A Trap out of Thin Air)

567
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,450
Feng Ying,

568
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:21,600
I knew you wouldn't have the lust

569
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,210
for beautiful girls.

570
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:25,800
Indeed, you're good at

571
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:27,870
using honey traps.

572
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:31,100
When Liu Ying stays with Li Yan,

573
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:32,890
she can persuade him

574
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,560
when they're in bed.

575
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:36,400
The moment I saw you,

576
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:40,340
I felt you were my soul mate.

577
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:42,090
Qingping Plan

578
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:44,110
has come to the last step.

579
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:46,640
Chen Gong lost Di Yue

580
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,660
and has been in grief.

581
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:51,210
But he had to go on with his mission,

582
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:53,850
to lead elite members of Wuxian Sect

583
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:55,530
into the Military Technology Department,

584
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:57,890
disguised as the Shu Army.

585
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,080
And look at Xun Xu.

586
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:01,020
He did a great job

587
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:02,130
by setting a trap out of thin air.

588
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,670
He sneaked into the Military Technology Department

589
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,830
with a fake permit,

590
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:08,460
covered Chen Gong,

591
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:11,360
and left the back gate open for him.

592
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,000
But the permit is fake, anyway.

593
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:16,080
Wise men wouldn't be fooled.

594
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,070
Men in the Military Technology Department

595
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,500
saw through his fake permit.

596
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:22,030
He was caught, then.

597
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:24,130
Will he yield to torture and confess?

598
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:26,700
Chen Gong is in place.

599
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:29,700
Will Zhulong be successfully arrested?

600
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,120
The wonderful battle will begin momentarily.

601
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,160
I'll be right back.
